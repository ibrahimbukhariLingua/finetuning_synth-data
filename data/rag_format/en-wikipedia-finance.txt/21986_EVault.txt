## History

EVault was founded in 1997 as a cloud services company. By 2006, EVault had become, through revenues and acquisitions (including the Open File Manager product line from St. Bernard Software), one of the fastest-growing technology companies in North America.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Seagate Technology acquired EVault in 2007. In September 2008, Seagate rebranded EVault and other acquisitions into id i365, a Seagate Company. Seagate Recovery Services was taken from the i365 basket in 2011. In December 2011, the EVault name was restored.

On 16 December 2015, Carbonite acquired Seagate's EVault cloud backup service, including the brand name and logo, for $14M USD. In April 2017, Carbonite EVault became Carbonite Server Backup.

In 2019, Carbonite was acquired by OpenText.
