## History

L&T Technology Services (LTTS) was founded in 2006 as L&T Integrated Engineering Services. In its first year, the company generated $70 million in revenue. Initially, it only operated as the engineering arm of Larsen & Toubro and in 2013, as a result of L&T's strategy, the parent company was split into "nine verticals and six subsidiaries", of which this was one. It began to expand its engineering services as a developer of corporate software under a new brand name L&T Technology Services (LTTS).

In September 2016, LTTS had its initial public offering in the National Stock Exchange, making it the second L&T subsidiary to go public. A. M.

In June 2017, LTTS completed the acquisition of the Esencia, a San Jose, California-based engineering firm involved in development of "wireless connectivity solutions, perceptual computing, Internet of Things and advanced silicon products" for $27 million.
