### Smartphone era


#### Consumer devices

In 2009, KT was the first network to introduce the iPhone to South Korea. The origins of South Korea's domestic smartphone production industry can be traced back to Samsung's release of their first smartphone, a reaction to Apple's iPhone, which was well-received by the South Korean population.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Later, as the smartphone sector continued to grow, South Korea's LG Electronics also joined the competition. Unlike Apple and Samsung, LG's business strategy was to make more affordable devices rather than devices with higher specifications. Eventually, LG shifted to offering phones with a better camera and higher screen quality, which increased their cost of goods. The sales of their phones, however, did not improve.

LG announced its decision to exit the smartphone market in April 2021 due to their continued net loss in this sector. Until nowᵘⁿᵗⁱˡ ʷʰᵉⁿ?, Apple and Samsung have held the largest market shares, with LG trailing behind. Apple tried to capitalize on LG's exit of the smartphone market by advertising its products on LG's displays within marketsᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ. Samsung also took this opportunity to offer existing LG customers competitive deals on new Samsung phones, such as running trade-in events for used LG smartphones.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Competition between the two manufacturers in the South Korean market is still on-going.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
