# CNBC TV18



**CNBC TV18** is an Indian pay television business and financial news channel operated as a joint venture between NBCUniversal and Network18 Group.


## History

The network has its origins in ABNi, an Indian sub-feed of the Dow Jones-led Asia Business News (ABN) owned by TV18. In 1997, CNBC reached an agreement to merge its networks in Asia and Europe with Dow Jones under the CNBC banner. However, the agreement for ABNi did not contain any provisions on what would occur in the event of a change in ownership. After discussions with a CNBC lawyer and ABN's CEO Paul France (who led the merged CNBC Asia), TV18 would reach an agreement with CNBC to serve as its Indian partner. This led to the launch of CNBC India in 1999.

On 26 October 2011, TV18 launched a high definition sister channel, **CNBC TV18 Prime HD**; it was described as a "premium investor-focused" network, carrying a widescreen format with a focus upon on-screen data.

CNBC TV18 hosts the India Business Leader Awards (IBLA). CNBC Network18 Group has presented the awards each year since 2005.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
