Anglo-Egyptian Bank


# Anglo-Egyptian Bank



The **Anglo-Egyptian Bank** was a British overseas bank established in 1864.


## History

The founding banks were Agra and Masterman's Bank, La Compagnie Financière Maurice de Cattauï and the General Credit and Finance Co., and the bank incorporated Pastré Frères et Compagnie (est. 1821; reorganized 1827 by Eugène Pastré) and Giovanni Sinadino and Co., which was the only one of the four to have its seat in Egypt, in Alexandria. The senior officials of all four firms sat on the first board of directors.

In addition to its activities in Egypt, the Anglo-Egyptian opened branches in the British Mediterranean, where it frequently acted as banker to the British authorities.

The Anglo-Egyptian Bank issued banknotes for Malta in 1886.

1895, a notice signed by the secretary of the bank, William Hart, states the head office is located on Lombard Street, London, with branches in Alexandria, Cairo, Gibraltar, Malta, and Rue Lafayette of Paris

Until 1920 the Cattauï Family had a controlling interest in Anglo-Egyptian. Then in 1921 Barclays Bank initially acquired 15% of the bank before acquiring the Cattauï family's interest in 1924, which made Barclay's the majority stakeholder in Anglo-Egyptian. In 1925, Barclays Bank merged Anglo-Egyptian with Colonial Bank and National Bank of South Africa to form Barclays (Dominion, Colonial & Overseas). In 1956, following the Anglo-French attack on Port Said, the Egyptian government sequestrated the 19 branches, one sub-branch, and 26 agencies in Egypt, using them to found Bank of Alexandria.
