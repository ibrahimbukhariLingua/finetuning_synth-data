# AgriBank



**AgriBank**, part of the US Farm Credit System, serves as a wholesale lender and a farm credit bank (FCB) to a 15-state network of local farm credit associations in a district that stretches from Ohio to Wyoming and Minnesota to Arkansas. AgriBank is the second largest of the four banks in the Farm Credit System and has over $150 billion in assets. Like AgFirst Farm Credit Bank and Farm Credit Bank of Texas, Agribank is organized as an FCB while CoBank, the fourth bank in the system, is organized as an agricultural credit bank (ACB).

AgriBank is owned by member associations, which are owned by agricultural borrowers. In 2011, it relocated its headquarters to Wells Fargo Place in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.

Leadership includes an 17-seat board of directors and an executive team based in St. Paul. Directors serve 4-year terms.
