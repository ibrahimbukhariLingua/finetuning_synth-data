## Company History

In 1977 Walter Cruttenden III founded Capital Data Bank, a system that matched private companies with private investors by computer. Under Cruttenden's chairmanship that company grew into Cruttenden & Co. and began offering brokerage services in 1984. Byron Roth joined in 1992 and bought a 15 percent share of the company. He became president in 1994 and the company was renamed Cruttenden Roth.

Byron Roth became CEO in 1997 and retained that post when he became chairman on Cruttenden's resignation in November 1998.*The Orange County Business Journal* reported in April 2018 the colleagues remain friends, with Roth investing in several Cruttenden-founded companies and Cruttenden speaking at Roth’s business conferences. “Byron’s done such a terrific job growing Roth, just fulfilling every dream I had and then some,” Cruttenden said in an interview. In February 2000 the firm changed its name to Roth Capital Partners, Inc.

During the summer of 2020, Roth Canada, an affiliate of Roth Capital Partners focused on serving emerging growth Canadian companies and their investors, became an IIROC-regulated Dealer Member. Roth Canada is headquartered in Toronto and maintains an office in Vancouver.

In February 2023, Roth acquired Stamford, Connecticut-based MKM Partners, LLC. Through the acquisition, Roth added offerings in trading, research, sales, derivatives, event driven/risk arbitrage, proprietary studies, and high yield/credit.

Roth’s conferences also include charitable activities, including athletics events to support the Challenged Athletes Foundation, an organization which helps those with physical challenges gain and maintain access to sports. For over a decade, the Challenged Athletes Foundation has been the official charity of the annual conference, and as of March 2024, Roth’s conferences have raised $1.7 million for the organization.

RX3 also holds a signature charitable event annually: “a popular flag football tournament that attracts NFL quarterbacks like Joe Flacco, Bryce Young, and Orange County resident and RX3 investor Jared Goff, as well as Rodgers,” the *Orange County Business Journal* reported.
