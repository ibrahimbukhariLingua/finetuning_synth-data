## History

* 1896: foundation of Hoffmann-La Roche.
* 1933: foundation of Interpharma.
* 1950s: Cilag merged with Janssen Pharmaceutica, into Janssen-Cilag.
* 1996: Ciba-Geigy merged with Sandoz, with the pharmaceutical and agrochemical divisions of both staying together to form Novartis. Other Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz businesses were sold off, or, like Ciba Specialty Chemicals, were spun off as independent companies. The Sandoz brand disappeared for three years, but was revived in 2003 when Novartis consolidated its generic drugs businesses into a single subsidiary and named it Sandoz.
* 1990: Hoffmann-La Roche owned a majority of Genentech. It was to be completely integrated in 2009.
* 2000: Novartis divested its agrochemical and genetically modified crops business with the spinout of Syngenta, in partnership with AstraZeneca, which also divested its agrochemical business.
