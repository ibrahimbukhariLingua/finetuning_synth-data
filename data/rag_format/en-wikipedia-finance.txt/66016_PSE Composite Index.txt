PSE Composite Index


# PSE Composite Index



The **PSE Composite Index**, or the **PSEi** (previously **PHISIX**), is a stock market index of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) always consisting of 30 of the largest companies traded on the stock exchange. This is in contrast to the PSE All Shares Index which is an index of all stocks traded on the PSE.

The highest closing value was 9,041.20 on Friday, January 26, 2018.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The highest intraday value was 9,078.37 on Monday, January 29, 2018.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

It is the PSE's only broad-base index and is seen as an indicator of the general state of the Philippine business climate, although there is evidence the index may not be a reliable indicator of the state of the broader Philippine economy.

The PSE revises the list at least twice a year based upon requirements that include a minimum public float level of 20% (increased from 12% in 2018) and criteria for market liquidity and market capitalization.


## Formula

The following formula is used by the PSE to calculate the index's value:

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {PSE\ Index\_{t}={\textstyle \sum \_{i=1}^{n}(P\_{i}\times S\_{i}\times F\_{i})\displaystyle \over \ b}\times PSE\ Index\_{t-1}}}}

**Where**:

n = Total number of component companies (30)

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {P\_{i}}}} = Closing price of company i at day t

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {S\_{i}}}}= Available shares of company i at day t

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {F\_{i}}}}= Company free float level (0 to 1), where 1 means 100% free float.

b = Free float-adjusted market capitalization base
