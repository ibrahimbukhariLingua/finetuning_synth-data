# Tim Clark (airline executive)



**Sir Timothy Charles Clark** KBE FRAeS (born 22 November 1949) is a British business executive and the President of Dubai-based airline Emirates since January 2003. He was also the Managing Director of SriLankan Airlines until 2008.


## Education

He attended Kent College, Canterbury and is a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. He is an economics graduate from the University of London.


## Career

Clark has been in the civil aviation business since 1972 when he joined British Caledonian. In 1975, he moved to Gulf Air in Bahrain and subsequently to Dubai in 1985 where he became a member of the founding team of Emirates as Head of Airline Planning. He is currently the President of Emirates. He was also Managing Director of SriLankan Airlines until 2008. The latter post resulted from the acquisition of a 40% stake in SriLankan Airlines by Emirates in April 1998. However, that post was lost when the Sri Lankan government took control of the airline and Emirates never renewed their contract for management of the airline.

Clark became President of Emirates in 2003. In addition, Clark is the Chairman of the Emirates Airline Foundation, a non-profit charity which provides humanitarian philanthropic aid and services for children in need around the world. In December 2019, Clark announced that he would be stepping down from his role as President of Emirates, but subsequently delayed his retirement due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
