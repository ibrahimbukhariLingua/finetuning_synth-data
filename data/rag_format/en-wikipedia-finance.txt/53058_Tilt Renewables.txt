Tilt Renewables


# Tilt Renewables



**Tilt Renewables Pty Ltd** is an Australian electricity generation company. It was previously dual listed on the New Zealand stock exchange and Australian stock exchange. As of 2022, the Powering Australian Renewables has merged with Tilt Renewables following a complex acquisition and merger, making it the largest private developer and generator of renewable electricity in Australia.

On 15 March 2021, a takeover was announced with support from the largest shareholders and independent board members. The proposed scheme of arrangement would be worth A$2.75 billion by a consortium where the New Zealand assets would be taken over by Mercury NZ and the Australian assets by Powering Australian Renewables Fund – itself a consortium of AGL Energy, QIC Global Infrastructure Fund and the Australian Government's Future Fund.

The takeover was successful in August 2021. PowAR took over the Australian assets and operations of the former Tilt Renewables, making it the largest private developer and generator of wind and solar electricity in Australia. The combined Australian organisation was subsequently renamed back to Tilt Renewables. It holds the assets of both former entities, and is owned 40% by QIC, 40% Future Fund and 20% AGL.
