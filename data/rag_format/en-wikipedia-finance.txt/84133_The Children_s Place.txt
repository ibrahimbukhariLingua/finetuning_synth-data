## History

The company was founded in 1969. It was acquired by Federated Department Stores in 1981. After Campeau Corporation acquired Federated, they sold The Children's Place to a group led by Joseph Sitt in 1988. They became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange in 1997 under the ticker symbol PLCE.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Children's Place had a location in the mall in New York's World Trade Center. This location was eventually destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Between 2004 and 2007, the company owned and operated 335 Disney Stores through a subsidiary Hoop Holdings/Hoop Retail Stores LLC. Disney sold the chain for the cost of inventory to Children's Place subsidiary Hoop Holdings, plus a 15-year licensing agreement. Mario Ciampi, senior vice president of store development and logistics, was named Hoop/Disney Store North America president. The company agreed to pump $100 million in operation upgrades and remodeling. Under the licensing agreement, a "royalty holiday" period existed until October 2006 to allow revamping of the stores. The royalty thereafter was 5% of store sales, while online sales get Disney a 9% to 10% royalty. Hoop Holdings was able to write off the cost ($48 million) of the equipment and property received in the purchase.

Hoops saw progress with its strategy as open stores in 2006 for 11 months saw 15% increase in sales assisted by a better Disney box office results and the Disney Channel hit *High School Musical*. A store website would be up and running in April 2007.

In June 2007, the company began negotiations to sell the rights back to The Walt Disney Company. On March 26, 2008, Hoop Holdings/Hoop Retail Stores LLC and related subsidiaries of TCP that operated Disney Store retail locations filed for bankruptcy. Hoop obtained from Wells Fargo $35 million of debtor-in-possession financing and appointed Perry Mandarino of Traxi LLC, the Manhattan financial-restructuring company, as chief restructuring officer. On May 1, 2008, 231 Disney Stores in North America once again became the property of Disney, operating under the Disney Consumer Products arm.

On December 11, 2009, The Children's Place announced the appointment of former Lord & Taylor CEO Jane T. Elfers as president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, effective January 4, 2010.

In the summer of 2013, the store withdrew a T-shirt from the stores with four options for "My best subjects" including "Shopping, Music, Dance and Math." While shopping, music, and dance were checked, math was left unchecked because the T-shirt stated "Nobody’s perfect!"

Mithaq Capital of Saudi Arabia took a majority stake in The Children’s Place in February 2024 after the company said it was experiencing liquidity problems.

The Children's Place announced a financing agreement with Mithaq to provide $78.6 million of interest-free, unsecured and subordinated term loans to strengthen the company’s liquidity position.

In April, the company announced $90 million in new unsecured financing provided by Mithaq.

Elfers stepped down as CEO on May 20, 2024, receiving a $3.75 million payout to exit the company.

Turki S. AlRajhi, Chairman and CEO of Mithaq and Chairman of The Children’s Place, outlined background and strategy for The Children's Place in a letter to The Children’s Place shareholders on May 24, 2024.
