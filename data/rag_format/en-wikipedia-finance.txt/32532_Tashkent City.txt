# Tashkent City



**Tashkent City** (International Business Center “Tashkent City”, Uzbek: *“Tashkent City” xalqaro biznes markazi*, “Tashkent City” IBC) is a business center under construction in Tashkent. Located in the Shayxontoxur district, between Alisher Navoi Avenue, Olmazor, Furkat streets and Islam Karimov Avenue.

Within the framework of the Tashkent City IBC, a business activity zone is being created that will unite business, residential apartments and leisure. The managing company of the Tashkent City IBC project is the Tashkent City Directorate.

Construction is being carried out on the site of the demolished mahallas (neighborhoods) of Olmazor and Ukchi, on a territory with a total area of 80 hectares. This is the largest construction project in Uzbekistan. The construction of the project is carried out with financial investments from private investors.

The commercial concept of the project was developed by the American company Cushman & Wakefield.

Of the 8 projects for the future business center, the concept proposed by the Turkish architectural company Tabanlıoğlu Architects was chosen.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## History

Plans for the creation of the Tashkent City business center were first publicly announced by the candidate for the post of President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev on November 24, 2016 during a meeting with voters in Tashkent as part of the election campaign.

Work to prepare the concept of an international business center took 8 months. As a result, out of 7 concepts presented, 2 were taken as the basis for the project.

On July 28, 2017, a government decree was adopted on the creation of the Tashkent City IBC. The directorate for the construction of the complex was subsequently headed by Jakhongir Artikkhodjayev.

Construction work began in October 2017, at which time it became known about planned demolitions at the site of the future complex.

As a result, the following buildings were demolished:

* residential buildings that have been resettled since 2015 in the “Ukchi” and “Olmazor” neighborhoods;
* the building of the Republican Cinema House, built in 1982 according to the design of the architect Rafael Khairutdinov;
* the Tashkent Metro administration building (the enterprise is located on the same street in a 9-story building);
* the building of the Main Directorate of Migration and Registration of Citizenship of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan (moved);
* the building of the Republican Center for Children's Art "Barkamol Avlod" (formerly the Palace of Pioneers and Schoolchildren named after V.I. Lenin);
* banquet hallᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On May 8, 2018, the Construction Directorate was headed by Sherzod Khidoyatov.
