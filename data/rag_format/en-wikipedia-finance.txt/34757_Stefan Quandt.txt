# Stefan Quandt



**Stefan Quandt** (born 9 May 1966) is a German billionaire heir, engineer and industrialist. As of December 2024, *Forbes* estimated his net worth at US$21.6 billion, ranked at number 89 on Bloomberg Billionaires Index.


## Early life

Quandt was born in Bad Homburg to Herbert Quandt, a German industrialist and prominent Nazi, and Johanna Quandt. He earned a degree from the University of Karlsruhe where he studied economics and engineering, from 1987 to 1993.


## Career

From 1993–1994, Quandt worked for the Boston Consulting Group in Munich. From 1994 to 1996 he worked for Datacard Group of Minneapolis as a marketing manager in Hong Kong.


### BMW

On his father's death in 1982 Quandt inherited 17.4% of BMW, the company his father had saved from bankruptcy in 1959. From further purchases he later owned 23.7% of the company. In 1997, he joined the company's supervisory board.

Following his mother’s death in 2015, Quandt’s voting stake in BMW temporarily increased to 34.19 percent, above a 30 percent threshold which triggered a compulsory takeover offer under German rules. He subsequently asked the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to be excused from these rules. In 2018, Quandt became BMW’s largest single shareholder when his direct ownership increased with shares inherited from his mother, giving him a so-called “blocking stake” of 25.83 percent, worth 13.4 billion euros ($16.6 billion). He currentlyʷʰᵉⁿ? is deputy chairman of the BMW supervisory board.


### Delton

Quandt also inherited from his father substantial holdings in other companies, many of which he has been running through his holding company, Delton AG, since 1989. These include:

* 76.8% of CEAG, (small power supplies and recharging devices for mobile phones)
* 87.6% of Logwin AG (formerly Thiel Logistik, a logistics and freight forwarding company)
* 100% of Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, which makes homeopathic preparations
* 100% of CeDo Household Products, which makes freezer bags, plastic and aluminium wraps and foils, bin liners, and coffee filters

With his mother, Quandt owned 18.3% of Gemplus International, a large digital security company, before its merger to form Gemalto in 2006.

* Heliatek, organic solar panels
* Solarwatt, manufacturer of PV panels, solar batteries and energy management solutions

## *The Silence of the Quandts*

The Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award winning documentary film *The Silence of the Quandts* by the German public broadcaster ARD described in October 2007 the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. The family's Nazi past was not well known, but the documentary film revealed this to a wide audience and confronted the Quandts about the use of slave labourers in the family's factories during World War II. As a result, five days after the showing, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian will examine the family's activities during Adolf Hitler's dictatorship. The independent 1,200-page study researched and compiled by Bonn historian, Joachim Scholtyseck, that was released in 2011 concluded: "The Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis". As of 2008ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ no compensation, apology or memorial at the site of one of their factories, have been permitted. BMW was not implicated in the report.
