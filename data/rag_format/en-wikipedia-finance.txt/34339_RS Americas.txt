## History

The Americas division of RS Group was founded in 1928 in Chicago, Illinois by Simon "Sy" Wexler as Allied Radio, the radio parts distribution arm of Columbia Radio Corporation (also founded by Wexler in 1921).

In 1970, the Tandy Corporation, Radio Shack's former parent company, purchased Allied Radio, the consumer division, along with Allied Electronics, the industrial division.

In 1999, Allied became the North American division of Electrocomponents. In 2016, Allied expanded into South America with a full-service office in Santiago, Chile, and in 2017, grew its sales presence in Mexico. In October 2022, Allied announced they would be changing their name to RS in Q1 2023 as part of an overall rebranding strategy to establish a better connection across RS Groupâ€™s products and services. On February 6, 2023, the name change became official.
