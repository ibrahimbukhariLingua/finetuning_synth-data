## History

Marriott Ownership Resorts Inc. (MORI) was established on April 17, 1984 with the acquisition of American Resorts on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Marriott’s Monarch became the first MORI resort. In 1995, MORI became Marriott Vacation Club International. The move reflected the company’s evolution from real estate development and sales focus to "delivering an overall vacation experience". In 1997, the company expanded to Europe with its first resort in Marbella, Spain. In 2001, the first Asian resort in Phuket, Thailand was added to the company's collection. Similar to its successful segmentation of the lodging industry pioneered in the 1980s, Marriott Vacation Club International introduced The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club in 1999 – a luxury fractional ownership offering. Two years later, the Grand Residences by Marriott brand was created.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The first property opened in 2002 in South Lake Tahoe, California.
