# Genus plc



**Genus plc** is a British-based business selling elite genetics and other products manufactured using biotechnology to cattle and pig farmers. It is headquartered in Basingstoke and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.


## History

The business has its origins in the former Breeding & Production Division of the Milk Marketing Board which was established in 1933 and broken up in 1994. In 1999 Genus acquired ABS Global, a company founded by J.R. Prentice in the US as the *American Breeders Service* in 1941 selling the semen of cattle. In 2005 Genus acquired, through the takeover of Sygen International plc, PIC, a company founded by six pork producers in the UK as the *Pig Improvement Company* in 1962.


## Operations

The company has three divisions:

* ABS - products for cattle
* PIC - products for pigs
* Genus R&D - management of the research and development pipeline for cattle, pigs and other species.

PIC's pedigree herds sire an estimated 30% of commercially reared pigs.
