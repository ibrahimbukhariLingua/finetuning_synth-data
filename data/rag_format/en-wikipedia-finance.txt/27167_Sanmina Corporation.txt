## History

Sanmina was founded by Jure Sola and Milan Mandarić in 1980 as a printed circuit board manufacturer. It was named after Milan Manadarić's daughters Sandra and Jasmina. During the 1980s, it expanded into manufacturing backplanes and subassemblies for the telecommunications industry. During the 1990s, the company grew, producing complete products for major OEM companies and completing a number of acquisitions. Jure Sola became CEO and Chairman of Sanmina in 1991. The company completed an initial public offering on NASDAQ in 1993.


### Merger and name changes

In December 2001, Sanmina merged with SCI Systems of Huntsville, Alabama, for $6 billion in cash, stock, and debt. Although Sanmina was only half as large as SCI at the time, it was in a better cash position because its core telecommunications business was performing well, whereas SCI's lower-margin businesses such as personal computer manufacturing, were struggling. Shortly after, Sanmina-SCI bought E-M Solutions, a bankrupt Fremont, California electronics manufacturer, for $110 million in cash. Then in early 2002, Sanmina acquired Rancho Santa Margarita-based Viking Interworks for $15 million ($10.9 million in cash and 390,000 shares of Sanmina stock worth $10.26 per share at the time).

On November 15, 2012, the company changed its name to Sanmina.

On July 2, 2015, the company announced that it had acquired the CertainSource Technology Group.
