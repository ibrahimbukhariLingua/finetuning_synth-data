## History

AGT Advanced Global Trading was set up by a group of investors and angel investors in 2009 with headquarters in the Dubai United Arab Emirates; Dubai was chosen for its commercial significance within the MENA region. AGT trades within the UAE and Gulf Cooperation Council regions. It later expanded into consultancy.

In August 2011 the company established a partnership with Equinox Designs to offset the environmental waste created by the exhibition industry.

The partnership is represented by the AGT brand, which appears on the Lotus F1 car driven by Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean.

In December 2012, the company signed an agreement with the cleaning specialist Grako in Dubai, to become the country's first carbon neutral company
