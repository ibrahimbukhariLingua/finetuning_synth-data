**Karen L. Pritzker** (born 1958) is an American documentary film producer, investor, and philanthropist. She is a member of the Pritzker family, the granddaughter of A.N. Pritzker and daughter of Robert Pritzker.


## Biography

Pritzker was born in Oberlin, Ohio, the daughter of Audrey (née Gilbert) and Robert Pritzker. She has two full siblings: Jennifer N. Pritzker (b. 1950), a retired Lt Colonel in the Illinois State National Guard and founder of the Pritzker Military Library, and Linda Pritzker (b. 1953), an American lama in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Her parents divorced in 1979. In 1981, her mother remarried Albert B. Ratner, the co-chairman of Cleveland-based real estate developer Forest City Enterprises. In 1980, her father remarried Irene Dryburgh with whom he had two children, her half siblings: Matthew Pritzker and Liesel Pritzker Simmons.

Her father diversified the Chicago-based family business, the Marmon Group - along with his brothers Jay Pritzker and Donald Pritzker - building it into a portfolio of over 60 diversified industrial corporations. They also created the Hyatt Hotel chain in 1957 and owned Braniff Airlines from 1983–1988. The family has been divesting its assets: in 2006, the family sold Conwood, a smokeless tobacco company, for $3.5 billion to cigarette company Reynolds American Inc; in 2007, the family sold control of the Marmon Group to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for $4.5 billion; and in 2010, the family sold its majority stake in Transunion, the Chicago-based credit reporting company, for an undisclosed amount to Chicago-based private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners.

Pritzker graduated with a B.A. from Northwestern University. Pritzker worked as an editor at the magazine *Working Mother* before the family sold it in 1986 and has written for various publications including *Success*, *Seventeen*, *Kirkus Reviews*, and *Newsday*. Pritzker invests her wealth through an investment portfolio, the Pritzker/Vlock family office which manages a diverse asset base of emerging biotechnology, medical device companies, consumer technology products, and real estate. Pritzker also operates a venture fund, LaunchCapital LLC with a core focus in the technology, consumer and medical businesses.

In 2012, Pritzker co-founded KPJR Films with James Redford. She has since executive-produced three documentary film features: *The Big Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia*, *Paper Tigers*, and *Resilience: The Biology of Stress and The Science of Hope*.
