### Authorship

Dychtwald is the author of four books, including the national bestseller *Ageless Aging: A Woman’s Guide to Increasing Healthspan, Brainspan, and Lifespan. Ageless Aging* made USA Today and Publisher’s Weekly national best-seller lists.

Dychtwald’s books discuss the economic improvement of women over time and how their increasing social and political power will impact fields such as financial services, healthcare, and consumer marketing. *Influence: How Women’s Soaring Economic Power Will Transform Our World for the Better* addresses how traditional roles for men and women have been changing, with women making up more than half of those employed and the majority of university degrees conferred annually.

*Cycles: How We Will Live, Work, and Buy* discusses demographic shifts in the population as people live to older ages and are still involved in economic systems, with 50-year-olds becoming a dominant part of the business environment. *The Boston Globe* referred to the book's subject matter as a "thought-provoking, well-reasoned argument" and that Dychtwald successfully made her book "packed with anecdotes, making for a lively read."

In the children’s book *Gideon's Dream: A Tale of New Beginnings*, Dychtwald and her husband, Ken, teach children about changes that continue to happen to people as they get old and how it is not only children who have to deal with changes in their lives. A senior illustrator for Disney, Dave Zaboski, and his 7-year-old daughter created the pictures for the book.

She also frequently acts as a professional speaker in various international events, such as a trip to Melbourne, Australia in June of 2000 to speak on the subject of choice and how lifestyle trends are shifting so more people at various stages of their life can make new career decisions and even continue their education at an old age. She presented before the Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce in September of 2007 on how baby boomers are working to older ages and the impact that would have on the economy. Alongside Merrill Lynch's Women and Financial Wellness division, Dychtwald conducted a study on the amount of money on average men and women make and determined there was a significant wage gap because women retire early, with this often putting them in financial difficulties in their later years.
