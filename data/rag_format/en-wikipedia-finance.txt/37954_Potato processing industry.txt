With its significant economic impact and contribution to the food industry, the potato processing industry serves as a vital link between potato growers, manufacturers, and consumers worldwide.


## History

The origins of potato processing can be traced back to ancient times before Columbus arrived in the Americas. During this prehistoric period, Native Americans used drying techniques to preserve potatoes, reduce their size, and create flour and alcoholic beverages. As the potato became a widely consumed crop worldwide, processing methods were developed for various purposes. Initially, these methods were focused on providing sustenance for sailors and soldiers, but later expanded to meet the needs of aviation, convenience, and indulgence.


## Frozen potatoes

Frozen potatoes have been among the biggest types of processed potatoes which are consumed. This is due to the convenience they offer in terms of preparation time and flexibility. They have a long shelf life and the vitamins and other nutrients are preserved in them. Frozen potatoes, as well as the different productsᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, are obtained by processing fresh potatoes with advanced equipment at very low temperatures. They are also available in different forms, such as hash brown, French fries, shapesᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and mashed potatoes and also in the form of toppedᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ or stuffed potatoes and other forms. The products are consumed either in fast-food restaurants or by individual customers who buy them in retail stores.

The Netherlands and Belgium are the two top producers of frozen potato products in Europe. Last yearᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, Europe produced 3.8 billion euros worth of deep-frozen french fries. About one-third came from Dutch manufacturers (nearly 1.3 billion euros), which amounted to over 1.6 million tonnes, or a weekly supply of ten French fry cone holders of 175 grams per Dutch resident.
