## History


### Foundation and beginnings

The origins of Hartmann date back to 1818 when Ludwig von Hartmann took over a mechanical spinning mill in Heidenheim, which soon became one of the largest cotton mills in Germany.

In 1843, Ludwig von Hartmann transferred the business to his three sons.

The Tübingen surgeon Victor von Bruns developed an absorbent dressing cotton made from cotton through degreasing and bleaching, known as *Bruns's wool*, in 1865.

In 1873, Paul Hartmann began the production of degreased dressing cotton in Heidenheim. The dressings, known as *Lister's Carbol-Gauze*, were impregnated with antiseptics using a method developed by Joseph Lister and demonstrated germicidal properties. Lister's contributions resulted in a decrease in post-operative infections, enhancing the safety of surgical procedures for patients. This earned Lister the title of "father of modern surgery."


### Expansion and acquisitions

In 1912, the company was transformed into a stock company under general director Walther Hartmann, the grandson of the founder Ludwig von Hartmann.

In 2000, the Hartmann Group acquired KOB GmbH (Karl Otto Braun). In 2005, Hartmann established the subsidiary CMC Consumer Medical Care GmbH to produce cotton/cosmetics, medical products, baby care, and home care products. The following years saw further expansion; in April 2008, Kneipp GmbH became a wholly owned subsidiary, and in October of the same year, Hartmann acquired Bode Chemie GmbH, a Hamburg-based provider of disinfection, hygiene, and skin protection products.


### Recent developments

In January 2019, Britta Fünfstück took over as the new CEO of the company. Shortly after her appointment, Fünfstück presented a transformation plan that included investments in new products and digital business models, as well as a stronger focus of sales on the end customer.

In August 2019, Safran Coating, a company producing silicone coatings, was acquired, which has since been operating under the name Advanced Silicone Coating.

In 2021, Hartmann acquired pflege.de, an online platform which offers guidance and services for home care as well as care aid supply.

In July 2023, the company announced its plans to make further investments in Germany, including a double-digit million-euro investment for the production facility in Herbrechtingen, where adult incontinence products are manufactured.
