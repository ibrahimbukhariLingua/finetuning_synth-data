## Notable clients

Notable clients of Sonnenschein included:


## Notable matters

* In a case that began in 2002, Sonnenschein won a major trademark case for S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., regarding its Off-based family of marks. S.C. Johnson alleged trademark infringement by the defendant, Buzz Off Insect Shield, LLC. At the 2007 trial, a jury found Buzz Off liable for trademark infringement and determined that the infringing conduct was willful and intentional. In March 2009, the judge issued a permanent injunction, nationwide, requiring Buzz Off (as well as all of its vendors) to cease using "Buzz Off" in virtually all respects, including on the Internet.
* Sonnenschein represented German-based **Fresenius Medical Care**, a DAX-30 company, in transactions highlighted by its $4.5 billion acquisition of Renal Care Group by merger in 2005, and also including its $500 million sale of dialysis service businesses to a private equity buyer and its $100+ million acquisition of Renal Solutions Inc, a medical device manufacturer.
* On appeal, Sonnenschein obtained victories for DIRECTV, Inc. in two unanimous published decisions in the 3rd and 5th U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. The rulings in *DIRECTV, Inc. v. Bennett* and *DIRECTV, Inc. v. Leto* established precedents for companies that rely on the Federal Wiretap Act and the Federal Communications Act in combating satellite and cable piracy.
* The firm represented WellPoint, the nation's largest health insurer, in its $6.5 billion acquisition in 2006 of WellChoice, the Blue Cross insurer of five million people in New York and New Jersey.
* Sonnenschein represented EMI Group Limited, a major music company, in connection with its participation in the MySpace Music joint venture and related agreements authorizing MySpace Music's digital distribution of EMI's sound recordings and music videos in connection with, among other things, ad-supported streaming and e-commerce offerings including downloads and ringtones.

### Hurricane Katrina litigation

* *Chehardy v. Allstate, et al. / Vanderbrook v. Unitrin, et al.*, (App. No. 07-302119, reported at 495 F.3d 191 (5th Cir. August 2, 2007)): One of the most significant issues in the massive Hurricane Katrina litigation was whether the insurers' standard flood exclusions applied to preclude flood damage resulting from the hurricane, even if the cause of the flooding was something man-made, such as the failure of the New Orleans levees. The Federal Court in Louisiana, per Judge Duval, held that the flood exclusions would not apply in this circumstance. Sonnenschein represented one of the lead parties in the appeal of Judge Duval's order to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the prior adverse district court decision and ruled that the flood exclusion in the homeowners policies at issue applied to all floods, whether man-made or naturally occurring. The court also held that the Hurricane Deductible Endorsement did not provide or expand coverage to include damage caused by flooding. This decision saved the insurance industry billions of dollars in potential exposure.
* *In re Katrina*, (App. No. 08-30145, reported at 524 F.3d 700 (5th Cir. April 11, 2008)): In this matter, the state of Louisiana filed a class action, in Louisiana state court, against more than 200 homeowner insurance companies, including several Sonnenschein clients, seeking to recoup an alleged $9 billion in grants made by the state under the Road Home program, which was established in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The state asserted rights as a subrogee under thousands of homeowners policies, as well as the rights of underlying policyholders who were allegedly under-compensated for hurricane-related losses by their respective insurance carriers. The defendants removed the case to federal court and the state sought remand. In a substantial victory for Sonnenschein's clients, the 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's order denying remand, finding that the case had been properly removed to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA).
* *State of Louisiana v. Allstate, et al.*, (App. No. 08-30465): The 5th Circuit affirmed a district court ruling denying the Louisiana attorney-general's motion to remand in the state's antitrust price-fixing case against Allstate and others. The court accepted the defense case that the state's action in *State of Louisiana v. Allstate, et al.*., was subject to federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), even though the complaint contains no express class action allegations.

## Corporate social responsibility


### Pro bono

* Sonnenschein, in conjunction with the advocacy organizations Equip for Equality, Access Living and the ACLU, reached a groundbreaking agreement in a class action lawsuit brought against the State of Illinois for its ongoing violation of the civil rights of people with developmental disabilities. The agreement, when approved by the court, will bring justice to people with developmental disabilities, giving them the choice to receive long-term care services in integrated community settings. As a result, they no longer will be compelled to live in segregated institutions in order to receive the services they require.
* Sonnenschein assisted in the successful completion of the Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park adjacent to the Pentagon. The Pentagon Memorial Fund was established by the families of the 184 victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in Washington, D.C.. As a result of the firm's multi-year pro bono representation of the Pentagon Memorial Fund, Sonnenschein was recognized at the dedication of the Memorial on September 11, 2008. The Memorial Fund allows for the construction and permanent maintenance of the Pentagon Memorial, which is the first of the major 9/11 memorials to be completed and opened to the public.
* Lawyers at Sonnenschein successfully represented a low-income Los Angeles community in preventing the installation of a dangerous railroad line immediately adjacent to an elementary school.

### Legacy Charter School

In 2005, Sonnenschein became the first law firm to establish and fund a charter school, the Legacy Charter School in North Lawndale, an inner-city community on Chicago's West Side. The chair of the firm's pro bono committee and former managing partner serves as chief operating officer of the school. Lawyers and staff from the Chicago office routinely work with and tutor students. In addition, other firm employees provide a wide variety of support on school operations and management including finances, information technology, human resources and audio visual.


### KEEN

Kids Enjoying Exercise Now (KEEN) is an organization founded in 1988 by Sonnenschein chairman Elliott Portnoy when he was a student in Oxford, England, and brought to Washington, D.C., in 1992. KEEN provides a broad range of exercise opportunities for disabled children in activities such as basketball, swimming and soccer. During its centennial celebration in 2006, Sonnenschein helped expand KEEN to New York and San Francisco, joining existing programs near firm locations in Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, St. Louis and Washington. In 2008, the firm helped start the program in Phoenix. Sonnenschein lawyers and staff are encouraged to volunteer time with their local KEEN chapter.


### Sonnenschein Scholars

As part of the firm's centennial in 2006, the firm created the Sonnenschein Scholars program. During the summer of 2006, and continuing through 2010, Sonnenschein has underwritten and will continue to underwrite the costs (more than $200,000 per year) associated with students working at public interest organizations of their choice during the summer before their second year of law school. Two Sonnenschein Scholars are chosen from each of 25 leading law schools around the country including Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and University of Chicago.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
