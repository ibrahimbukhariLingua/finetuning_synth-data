## History

The first Wall Street Institute centers opened in Italy in 1972, and within two years 24 new centers opened across Italy. In 1983, Wall Street Institute expanded outside of Italy, and by the late 1980s Wall Street Institute was well established across Europe. Expansion continued through the early 1990s, when centers were opened in Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela. Beginning in the late 1990s, Wall Street Institute expanded into the Middle East and then to Asia, which has grown to be a significant part of its business.

In 1997, Wall Street Institute was purchased by Sylvan Learning Systems. In 2005, Wall Street Institute was acquired by the global private equity firm The Carlyle Group. Wall Street English was acquired by Pearson plc from an affiliate of The Carlyle Group and CITIC Private Equity for $92 million in cash in 2010. In 2017 Pearson sold it to EQT Private Capital Asia formerly known as Baring Private Equity Asia and CITIC Capital for around $300 million.

In 2013, the company launched a rebranding and introduced a new logo and united under one global name: Wall Street English.

It operated more than 70 centers in China. China was the biggest market for Wall Street English. Wall Street English’s Chinese entity was forced to close during the pandemic, having been hit by both Covid-19 and the government’s double reduction policy.


## Curriculum

The Wall Street English program is designed for all levels of learners. They have 20 different levels of English language courses ranging from beginner to advanced. Their program includes an English-only environment in their centers, highly qualified English-speaking teachers, social activities that allow students to practice English in a social, non-threatening environment, and a global online student community.
