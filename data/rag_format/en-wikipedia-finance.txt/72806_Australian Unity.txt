Australian Unity


# Australian Unity



**Australian Unity** is an Australian mutual company having its origins in the friendly societies movement. In 2012, Big Sky was merged with Australian Unity to become the banking arm of the company.


## History

It was formed as the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows (MUIOOF) in Melbourne, Victoria, on 7 December 1840 by eight men including Thomas Strode, publisher of the Port Phillip Gazette and Augustus Greeves, inspired by Independent Order of Oddfellows Manchester Unity.

In 1993, Manchester Unity merged with the Australian Natives' Association to form Australian Unity. Later mergers occurred with Grand United Friendly Society in 2005, Lifeplan Australia Friendly Society in 2009, and Big Sky Credit Union in 2012. Australian Unity has about 8,500 employees across healthcare, insurance and banking (in the guise of Big Sky Credit Union) divisions.

In 2012, Big Sky merged with Australian Unity to become the banking arm of Australian Unity. Ownership of Big Sky Credit Union Limited was transferred to Australian Unity Limited's subsidiary Lifeplan Australia Building Society Limited and renamed Big Sky Building Society Limited. Members of Big Sky Credit Union became members of Australian Unity.


## Manchester Unity Building

The company commissioned the Manchester Unity Building, a neo-Gothic Art Deco skyscraper, and one of the most well-known and recognisable buildings in Melbourne, Australia, in 1928. The building was constructed in 1932.

Another Melbourne building, formerly owned by Manchester Unity Oddfellows, at 335–347 Swanston Street was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth government in 1947. The building, constructed in 1940–41, sits opposite the State Library of Victoria, adjacent to the Melbourne Central shopping centre.
