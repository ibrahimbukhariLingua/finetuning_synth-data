Emission Performance Regulation 2019


# Emission Performance Regulation 2019



The **Emission Reduction Regulation 2019** (EU) 2019/631 is an EU regulation that requires progressive reduction in emissions by petrol or diesel vehicles.

It has been frequently updated, and is a step towards the EU's phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles by 2035, although many member states plan to act sooner, as may the EU.

The Regulation sets overall goals for reducing emissions on vehicle manufacturer production, although not individual vehicles.

Article 1 sets "an EU fleet-wide target of 95 g CO2/km for the average emissions of new passenger cars and an EU fleet-wide target of 147 g CO2/km for the average emissions of new light commercial vehicles registered in the Union". Article 1(4) requires a further 15% reduction by 2025, and article 1(5) requires a 55% reduction by 2030.

Article 2 defines the scope of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.

Article 6 enables manufacturers can form a pool to meet their targets.

Article 8 enables the commission to impose an "excess premium emission" on manufacturers that exceed a target, which goes into the EU's budget, of â‚¬95 per gram per kilometre of excess emissions.

Article 9 requires that manufacturer performance is published. Article 10 allows derogations for certain manufacturers.
