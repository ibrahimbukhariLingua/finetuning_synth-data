Data centre industry in India


# Data centre industry in India



**India** has growing **data centre industry**. Data centres are used for national security, internet infrastructure, and economic output. As of 2024, India's data centre capacity is at 950 MW, which is expected to be 1800 MW by 2026. The data centre industry is valued at US$1.2 billion in 2021, a 216% growth from $385 million in 2014. The number of data centres in India is 138, as of March 2022. India ranks 13th globally in terms of highest number of data centres.

As of 2021, Indian data centres occupy over 8 million sq ft area. 60% of total data centres are in Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

India's data centre capacity is projected to experience significant growth, doubling from 0.9 GW in 2023 to approximately 2 GW by 2026. This expansion is driven by the increasing digitization and data localization trends within the country. Despite generating 20% of the global data, India currently holds only a 3% share of global data centre capacity, highlighting substantial under-penetration in this sector. The estimated capital expenditure required for this capacity addition is around Rs 50,000 crore over the next three years. The cost of setting up data centres has also risen, with the average cost per MW increasing from Rs 40-45 crore to Rs 60-70 crore. The absorption levels in the industry have improved from 82% in 2019 to 93% in 2023, with revenue for industry players growing at a CAGR of nearly 25% from FY17 to FY23. CareEdge Ratings projects a 32% CAGR growth in revenue during FY24–26, with stable EBITDA margins expected over the next three years. The industry is also anticipated to see the entry of new players, which will help diversify the market share currently dominated by the top five players. The shift towards edge data centres is expected to meet the growing demand from tier II and tier III cities, ensuring lower latency and better service delivery.

### Future growth

In 2024, India's data centre industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increased digitalisation, rising internet penetration, and the government's push towards digital initiatives. The industry is expected to reach a market size of $5 billion by the end of 2024, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 25% over the past few years. Significant investments from both domestic and international players are enhancing the country's data infrastructure to meet the growing demand for storage and processing capabilities. Major global tech companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are collectively investing over $2 billion in expanding their data centre footprints in India, contributing to the industry's rapid expansion.

The Indian government's role in fostering this growth is pivotal. By introducing favourable policies and incentives, such as the Digital India program and data localisation mandates, the government is creating a conducive environment for investment. The data localisation policies alone are projected to drive the construction of over 100 new data centres by 2025. This is further supported by the proliferation of smartphones, e-commerce, and digital services, which has led to an exponential increase in data generation, with the total data consumption in India expected to surpass 25 exabytes per month by 2025. Businesses across various sectors are adopting cloud services, AI, and big data analytics, driving the need for robust data centre infrastructure.

Looking ahead, the data centre industry in India is expected to continue its rapid expansion. The market is projected to grow to $8 billion by 2026. Companies will likely invest heavily in modernizing existing facilities and constructing new ones to keep pace with technological advancements and growing demand. Additionally, there will be a stronger emphasis on sustainability, with data centres increasingly adopting green technologies and practices to minimize their environmental impact. This focus on sustainable development will be crucial as the industry scales up to meet the future digital needs of the country, with renewable energy sources expected to power at least 50% of data centres by 2030.
