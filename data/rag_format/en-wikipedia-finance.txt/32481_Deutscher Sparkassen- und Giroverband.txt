Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband


# Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband



The **Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband** (**DSGV**, lit. 'German association of savings banks and money transfers') is the association of German savings banks (German: *Sparkassen*) and the apex entity of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, the European Union's second-largest financial services group (after BNP Paribas) with 2.5 trillion euros combined assets as of end-2023. Germany's savings banks, owned by local governments, play a major role in the country's economy, together operating some 15,860 branches and employing about 284,800 people.


## History

German savings banks started organizing on a regional basis in the 1870s and early 1880s, e.g. the *Verband der Sparkassen in Rheinland und Westfalen und Sparkassenzeitung*, est. 1881. The first national conference of savings banks (German: *Deutscher Sparkassentag*) was held in 1882. on 6 December 1884, the first national umbrella organization was established as the *Deutscher Sparkassenverband* in Dortmund.¹²⁷ In 1892, it was agreed that the *Deutscher Sparkassenverband* would be an "association of associations" whose members would not be individual savings banks, but rather regional associations thereof (German: *Sparkassenverbände*). By 1911, fifteen such *Sparkassenverbände* had been established, covering all the country's savings banks.¹⁰²

on 26 October 1916 during World War I, the *Deutscher Zentralgiroverband* was established to coordinate the regional payments clearing houses or *Giroverbände* (lit. 'giro associations') that had appeared since 1908.

The DSGV was founded in 1924 by the merger of *Deutscher Sparkassenverband* and *Deutscher Zentral-Giroverband*, with seat in Berlin. It simultaneously absorbed the *Deutscher Verband der Kommunalen Banken*, a separate organization in Königsberg.

In 1947, after *de facto* separation from their Eastern German peers and central organization in East Berlin, the savings banks and regional associations in West Germany formed the *Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverbände und Girozentralen* (lit. 'work community of German savings banks and giro associations and payment clearing houses') as their new national organization. In 1953, it was restructured as the *Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband e.V.*, with head office in Bonn. Unlike the prior DSGV in Berlin, it was not a public corporation (German: *Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts*, abbreviated as ö.K.) but a non-profit association (German: *eingetragener Verein*, abbreviated e.V.).¹⁰³

Following German reunification, the DSGV relocated from Bonn to Berlin in 1999.

In April 2011, DSGV took control of DekaBank, buying a 50 percent stake from the Landesbanken, public sector banks such as HSH Nordbank, WestLB and SachsenLB [de] that stumbled badly during the financial crisis. After years of subsidising the activities of the Landesbank sector, savings banks have been more assertive about ending the Wall Street-style ambitions of some of these regional lenders.
