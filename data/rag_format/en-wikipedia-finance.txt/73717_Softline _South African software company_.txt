# Softline (South African software company)



**Softline** was a South African enterprise software company that existed as an independent company between 1988 and 2003 when it was acquired by the UK-based multinational corporation The Sage Group plc. Sage continued to use Softline as a brand name until 2013 when all of Softline's products were re-branded as Sage.

Sage's South African business continues to provide Sage's global products as well as local South African solutions that cover accounting, ERP, Payroll and HR, Business Intelligence, customer relationship management and retail software solutions to small, medium and larger sized companies in South Africa.


## History

Softline was founded by Ivan Epstein and Alan Osrin in 1988 during the formative years of the software industry with a mere R1,500 loan. The two founding members of Softline were soon joined by local entrepreneur Steven Cohen in 1990.

By 1993, more than 20,000 South African businesses were utilising Softline's Brilliant Accounting products aimed primarily at medium-sized enterprises. In 1994, Ivan Epstein secured a long-term agreement with Intuit, granting Softline exclusive distribution rights to the Intuit range of products in Southern Africa; Intuit acquired the South African business back from Softline in 2006.

Softline experienced growth during the 1990s and by 1995 began to actively pursue the implementation of Softline's listing in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. During this time, Softline's reseller base extended into Africa. On 19 February 1997, Softline Limited listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of R250m (Â£20m).

In October 1997, the black empowerment group Hosken Consolidated Investments (HCI) acquired 20% interest in Softline. In a back-to-back transaction, Softline acquired 60% of US-based SVI Holdings Inc., for R150 million. This transaction marked Softline's entry into international markets. At this time, SVI had operations based in the US and Australia. SVI Holdings Inc. had previously acquired Divergent Technologies Pty Ltd Propriety Limited in Sydney, Australia in October 1996, Applied Retail Solutions in San Diego, California to enter the point of sale market in the USA in July 1998 and Island Pacific Systems in Irvine, California, a leading retail applications' software group in the USA candour in July 1999. In July 1998, SVI transferred its listing to the American Stock Exchange (AMEX:SVI).


### Sale to Sage

In 2003, Softline was delisted from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to be acquired by The Sage Group plc, one of the leading providers of business management software and services to SME's.

In 1989, Alan Ware and Jeremy Waterman established LA Technology, the distributor for Accpac International throughout sub-Saharan Africa. LA Technology was later acquired by Accpac International in 2000 and became known as ACCPAC Africa. In 2004, ACCPAC Africa was acquired by the Sage Group plc from Computer Associates and was renamed Softline Accpac.

In May 2010, Softline announced the acquisition of Netcash (Pty) Ltd, a company that provides transaction processing services that was founded in 2002. Softline integrated Netcash into their accounting and payroll products. In 2013, Netcash was rebranded as Sage Pay before being sold in a management buyout and again becoming Netcash in 2019.

In 2013 Sage embarked on a programme of uniforming their product names and offerings and moved away from using the Softline brand name, branding the former Softline products as Sage.
