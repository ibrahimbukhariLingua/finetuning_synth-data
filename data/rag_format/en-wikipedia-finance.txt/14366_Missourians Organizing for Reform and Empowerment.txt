## History


### Activities


#### Fed Up, 2014

In November 2014, MORE was involved in the "Fed Up" campaign composed of 20 community and labor groups who met with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to present proposals related to extending central bank stimulus and increasing public input on monetary policy.


#### United Nations Committee Against Torture statement with parents of Michael Brown, 2014

On November 12, 2014, Michael Brown's parents submitted a prepared statement with Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment, Hands Up United and the Organization for Black Struggle to the United Nations Committee Against Torture stating that their son's death and the "excessive force by police officers on peaceful protesters" in Ferguson in the weeks that followed violated the principles of the U.N. convention entitled Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The statement made several requests of the United Nations including: recommending the immediate arrest of police officer Darren Wilson, the resignation of Police Chief Thomas Jackson, and granting amnesty to protesters arrested during related demonstrations. It also urged that the Ferguson Police Department be held responsible for "systematically targeting and harassing residents of color in a predatory and degrading manner".
