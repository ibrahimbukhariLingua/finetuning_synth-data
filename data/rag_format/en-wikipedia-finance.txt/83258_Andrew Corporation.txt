Andrew Corporation


# Andrew Corporation



**Andrew Corporation,** a former hardware manufacturer for communications networks, was founded by Victor J. Andrew in the basement of his Chicago, Illinois home in 1937, and further established in Orland Park, Illinois in 1953. Andrew was a renowned global telecommunications company that played a significant role in the development of wireless communication technologies.

Andrew Corporation products included antennas, cables, amplifiers, repeaters, transceivers, as well as software and training for the broadband and cellular industries. The corporation supported customers in 35 countries across Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas, with manufacturing plants in 12 countries, at one time employing over 4,500 people. Andrew's sales in 1999 exceeded US$791 million. Specific product applications include antennas, cables, amplifiers as well as software and training in radio and other wireless communication systems.

In 1992, Andrew Corporation was on the Chicago Tribune's "Chicago's Top 100 Companies",

Andrew notably held subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Scotland, and throughout the United States (California, Texas). In 1986 Andrew acquired Scientific Communications, Inc. (SciComm), and Kintec Corp, further acquiring The Antenna Company in 1996. Andrew acquired Channel Master's Smithfield, North Carolina satellite dish factory, equipment, inventory and intellectual property in an $18 million deal after that firm filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 2, 2003.

Andrew Corporation was acquired by CommScope for $2.6 billion in June 2007.


## Foundation

Originally founded in 1937, Victor J. Andrew planted the roots to Andrew Corporation in his Chicago bungalow home on Francisco Avenue in Chicago, Illinois before upgrading to a factory space on 75th Street a few short years later. The 75th Street location was just south of Midway Airport and mainly housed manufacturing plants and factory spaces.

In 1947, Victor J. Andrew and C. Russell Cox (original Andrew employee and future Andrew executive) made the executive decision that the company had outgrown the Chicago space and started inquiring on spaces in the suburbs with seemingly limitless property and business potential.


## Transition to Orland Park

After 10 years in their Chicago facility, Andrew Corporation moved operations to Orland Park, Illinois, a suburb about 15 miles south of the 75th Street location. Andrew purchased the 430 acre vacant, unincorporated lot for $200 per acre. The location was strategically chosen for its proximity to the Rock Island and Wabash Metra train lines, as well as its potential for future growth.

A ground-breaking ceremony was held at the Orland Park facility in 1949**.** The Andrew Orland Park (AOP) location housed the corporate office complex, as well as the 254,000 square foot factory.

Andrew operated through their Orland Park facility from 1948 to 2007, using the location as their global headquarters.


## Product manufacturing

Throughout its existence, Andrew Corporation produced a diverse range of products, each designed to meet the evolving needs of the market. Andrew Corporation provided communications infrastructure for the U.S. Military, as well as expanded the reach of communications technology for everyday people in a wide range of countries.


### Radio antennas (1937–1970s)

In its early years, Andrew Corporation specialized in manufacturing high-quality radio antennas. Founder Victor J. Andrew knew the importance of integrity in radio antennas from his background in ham radio broadcasting. These antennas were widely used in broadcast and communication systems, enabling long-range transmission and reception of radio signals.


### Coaxial cables (1940s–1980s)

During the mid-20th century, Andrew Corporation became a leading producer of coaxial cables, a crucial component for transmitting high-frequency signals in telecommunications and cable TV systems.

At one point, Andrew Corporation was the principal engineer for Chicago's WBKB TV station, which would later become Chicago's CBS affiliate.

Andrew's coaxial cable technology was acquired by Kabelmetal, a German telecommunications company that worked very closely with Founder Victor J. Andrew. Their cables were known for their exceptional signal integrity and durability.


### Microwave components (1950s–1990s)

In the 1950s, Andrew Corporation expanded its product line through manufacturing and acquisitions to include microwave components. These components played a pivotal role in satellite communications, radar systems, and microwave transmission networks, supporting a wide range of applications in the aerospace and defense sectors.


### Base station antennas (1960s–2000s)

As mobile telecommunication networks began to flourish, Andrew Corporation ventured into manufacturing base station antennas in the 1960s. These antennas were essential for providing reliable mobile communication services and enabled the expansion of cellular networks globally.


### Fiber-optic components (1980s–2000s)

With the rise of fiber optic technology, Andrew Corporation shifted its focus to produce a variety of fiber optic components during the 1980s. Their products included fiber optic connectors, couplers, and amplifiers, which contributed to the rapid growth and efficiency of fiber optic communication systems.


### Wireless communication infrastructure (1990s–2007)

As wireless communication technologies advanced, Andrew Corporation developed and manufactured various wireless infrastructure products, including tower-mounted amplifiers, base station subsystems, and remote radio heads. These products facilitated the deployment and enhancement of wireless networks worldwide, including infrastructure to sustain wireless positioning systems.


## International ventures

Andrew Corporation held a multitude of international offices and factories, the most prominent of these being located in Canada, Scotland, Australia, and Brazil. By 2003, over half of all Andrew Corporation floor space (1,765,000 sq. ft.) was in countries outside of the United States, including China, Scotland, Czech Republic, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Germany, Canada, Italy, and India.

Andrew's Brazilian manufacturing began in 1976 in Sorocaba. In Brazil, Andrew's manufacturing plants constructed Andrew’s Decibel Base Station Antenna, which supported the growing needs of customers in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean.

Andrew Corporation also provided for massive telecommunication strides for Russian infrastructure starting in 1991. Through the Russian joint venture (Metrocom), Andrew laid cable in Russian cities, including projects to sustain the Saint Petersburg Metro, ATM links, and phone service.

In 2007, Andrew Corporation worked to bolster communications infrastructure in the Hong Kong railway.


## Management reconstruction

With Victor J. Andrew's passing in 1971, Andrew Corporation needed to restructure management in a time of corporate culture uncertainty. In the wake of their founder, a Board of Directors was selected of the top company leaders. C. Russell Cox, longtime Andrew employee and friend of Victor, was elected to be Chairman of the Board. The 1971 Andrew Corporation Board of Directors was composed of Edward J. Andrew, Edith Andrew, Juanita Hord, Robert "Bob" Hord, Peter Gianchini, Robert "Bob" Lamons, and William "Bill" Morgan.

In 1980, Andrew Corporation stock was available for public trading, marking a shift in the company from private to public. With this shift in ownership, there was a subsequent shift in management. While Victor J. Andrew was Chairman of the Board, executives and board members were typically promoted internally from other positions in the company. In the years after his passing, many new executives and chairmen were hired externally, having never worked at Andrew Corporation, but with experience in the field of telecommunications from other companies.

1986 saw another major shift in management. Edward J. Andrew (son of Victor J. Andrew) became Chairman of the Board of Directors, with Floyd English becoming President and Chief Executive Officer. English then brought two more executives from external companies to become Board Members (Owen Bekkum, George Butzow). In this same year, Juanita and Robert Hord had left the Andrew Board of Directors, opting to focus efforts in the Aileen S. Andrew Foundation

In 1993, Edward J. Andrew left Andrew Corporation.


## Acquisitions

* Allen Telecom: Andrew Corporation acquired Allen Telecom, a leading provider of wireless communications infrastructure and solutions, to expand its presence in the wireless communication industry.
* Celiant Corporation: Andrew Corporation acquired Celiant Corporation, a company specializing in wireless communications systems, to strengthen its position in the mobile communication infrastructure market.
* EMS Wireless: Andrew Corporation acquired EMS Wireless, a provider of wireless network solutions, to enhance its portfolio of wireless communication products and services.
* Other Andrew Corporation acquisitions include Scientific Communications (SciComm), Emerald Technology Inc., Yanti Fine Cable Co., and Chesapeake Microwave Technologies, The Antenna Company, Channel Master, Precision Antennas Ltd., and Nortel.

Having acquired these competitors (mainly SciComm and Kintec Corp.), Andrew Corp. was able to obtain U.S. Military and international contracts for antenna receivers and optical tracking equipment, and by 1987 sales in the company's government products division had climbed by 88 percent.


## Merger with CommScope

In 2005, Ralph Faison (President and CEO, former Board of Directors member) mediated an acquisition of Andrew Corporation by ADC Telecommunications out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. This acquisition, which would have merged Andrew with ADC for $2 billion, was mutually terminated in 2006. With the termination, Andrew Corp. was made to pay ADC $10 million in termination fees, along with an additional $65 million in the case that Andrew was sold to another company in the 12 months proceeding the termination.

Immediately after the terminated Andrew/ADC merger in 2006, CommScope, a telecommunications company based in Hickory, North Carolina, put forward a rival bid of $1.7 billion, which was quickly rejected. Andrew Corp. would not seek acquisition until 12 months after the ADC termination to avoid the $65 million fine to ADC.

In 2007, CommScope was set to acquire Andrew Corporation in a $2.6 billion deal through a stock swap, positioning Andrew's stock prices at $15.00/share at the time of acquisition. Ralph Faison justified his decision on the 2007 Andrew/CommScope merger by stating "CommScope has a strong position in the corporate-wireless market, an area where Andrew was weak." Over 120 executive positions in the newly relocated headquarters in Westchester, IL were eliminated.

Products manufactured in the Andrew Corporation era are still in production today through their predecessor, CommScope. CommScope's Andrew product line includes Heliax Cables, Base Stations, and Antenna Systems.


## Legacy

Andrew Corporation has had an immense impact on the community from which it operated from.

Founder Victor J. Andrew and his wife, Aileen S. Andrew, consistently fostered a sense of urgency in education and personal ambition. Built in 1977, Victor J. Andrew High School serves over 2,000 students annually, sporting a flash symbolic of the generosity of the Andrew Corporation.

The Aileen S. Andrew Foundation (ASAF) provides scholarships and grants to foster individual growth and enhance communities through education, humanitarian efforts, and the arts. ASAF operates today through the work of Victor J. Andrew's children and grandchildren.

The Aileen S. Andrew Memorial Library was built in November 1976. With funds from the Andrew Foundation, the library opened with 14,500 volumes, growing to hold 85,000 volumes as of 1991. The library is set to be demolished in January 2024 due to rising repair costs, as per Mayor Keith Pekau.
