myWorld's roots are linked to the Lyoness shopping community, established in 2003.

In July 2023, myWorld initiated a comprehensive restructuring. The company relocated its headquarters from London to Graz, Austria, and has since operated under the name myWorld International AG. myWorld International AG became the central service hub and the new umbrella company for the majority of myWorld subsidiaries worldwide.

Lyoness comprises at least seven corporations registered in Switzerland, nine corporations registered in Austria and approximately 42 additional national and regional corporations all around the globe.

## Legality and alleged deceptive practices

In March 2010, the Swiss magazine Beobachter published an article with a big review and analyses of Lyoness. In early 2012, *Kleine Zeitung* published an article suggesting that Lyoness operated an irrelevant shopping community. *L'Hebdo*, a Swiss magazine also criticed the company and its investment methods, not enough clear for general public.

In February 2012, an article by Beobachter revealed that internal Lyoness communications offered members "bounties" of up to 45,000 CHF for providing "relevant information" about critics of the company. Furthermore, the article highlighted concerns about the Lyoness business model, suggesting it prioritizes recruitment over providing discounts.

In 2012, the Austrian *Der Standard,* and the Swiss *Handelszeitung* reviewed the Lyoness and mentioned it has failed in financial fullfillment according to EU and Swiss investments regulations. The *Wiener Zeitung* reported in 2013 about Lyoness (now MyWorld) regarding financial tensions between the Austrian government and MyWorld, having provided a detailed analyses on MyWorld (Lyoness) management and functioning. In 2023 Lyoness filed for bankruptcy letting the new successor company MyWorld continue their shopping program.ᵇᵉᵗᵗᵉʳˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Television

On November 30, 2011, Dragons’ Den Canada aired an episode featuring the pitch of the Lyoness ‘Premium Member’ Andy Nyakas from Brampton, Ontario, asking the ‘Dragons’ to jointly invest CDN$175,000 to acquire Lyoness ‘business packages’ through him. None of the Dragons were willing to invest. Instead, they ridiculed him and his business idea, suggesting that it's 'distasteful', and 'a pyramid scheme’. Robert Herjavec also advised Nyakis, who borrowed against his house to acquire Lyoness positions, not to invest any more money in the Lyoness system.

Another television show that has reported on Lyoness is the Austrian public television program *ORF Report*. This programme aired episodes under the names ‘Lyoness - The money machine’ (November 13, 2012), 'Shopping Community Lyoness' (November27th, 2013) and ‘The man behind Lyoness’ (April 24, 2013), interviewing experts and former participants, which both say that Lyoness operates a pyramid scheme behind the façade of a ‘shopping community’
. The latter episode also features hidden camera footage of Hubert Freidl telling his followers that spreading ‘Cashback Cards’ is irrelevant – ‘it is all about the positions, positions, positions, positions’.


## Income

From a Lyoness income disclosure statement can be derived that the average Lyoness member in the United States receives a gross annual commission of approximately $275, or $23 per month. The monthly median commission value of $0.38 indicates that the vast majority of the members receives a lower commission than the 23 dollar monthly average.

Additionally, the document states that 46% of the Lyoness members makes $0 in commission and that the average annual expenditures, not taken into account when calculating the average commission, are $1,294. Similar figures have been reported in 2013, and in Canada.


## Internet

On the Internet, various websites and blogs from all over the world have focused critical attention on Lyoness, accusing the company of illegal business practices (mainly of running pyramid and Ponzi schemes) and questioning the alleged partnerships between Lyoness and several multinational corporations, as well as the validity and relevance of the certificates granted to the Lyoness shopping community. In April 2013, it was reported that former (Austrian) participants of Lyoness had organised themselves and founded an organisation and website called *Plattform Lyoness*. Not much later, an international equivalent was established under the name *Lyoness Complaint Centre*.

In the beginning of June 2013, it was reported that Lyoness filed legal complaints against the founders of *Plattform Lyoness*. The founders were forced to remove legal documents concerning Lyoness from their website. *Plattform Lyoness* has reported that a preliminary injunction in a subsequent court case forced *Plattform Lyoness* to change its domain name from www.plattform-lyoness.at to www.lyoness-geschaedigte-plattform.at, as the court found that domain names linking to negative content about Lyoness should carry a distinctive term to indicate that the domain is not hosted by Lyoness itself. *Plattform Lyoness* solved this by adding the term 'geschaedigte', which is the German word for 'victims'. Lyoness' other demands were not granted by the court.

In August 2015, two former employees were acquitted in Austria on charges of fraud and money laundering.
