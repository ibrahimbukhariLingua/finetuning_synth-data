## History

M. Dias Branco S/A emerged from an undertaking by the then future businessman, Manuel Dias Branco, in the city of Cedro, Ceará, later the bakery *Padaria Imperial*. The year was 1936 and in his bakery, Dias Branco produced bread, cookies and pasta from the Imperial brand for the population of Fortaleza. The bakery was on the bustling Avenida Visconde do Rio Branco.ᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ

In 1940 Manuel modernized his company, installing machines for the production of Imperial noodles and expanded his business, forming a partnership with his brothers José and Orlando, creating the company M. Dias Branco & Irmãos (The "M." comes from **M**anuel, the first name of the founder). In 1951 the bakery changes its address and name. The "Padaria Fortaleza" was transformed into a biscuit and pasta factory, which received the name "Fábrica Fortaleza" in 1953 when Francisco Ivens de Sá Dias Branco joined the company, changing the company's name to "M. Dias Branco & Cia. Ltd." In the following year, the company then invests in heavy machinery and, working in three shifts, creates the *Pepita* biscuit, which was its first great success.

In the 1960s, the company underwent major changes. In 1962, new products were launched, including the Petit Beure biscuit, and the character "Fortinho" was also created as the mascot of Fábrica Fortaleza, until then the only unit of the company. At the end of the decade, in 1967, the factory underwent its first expansion when it began to produce the "Extra-Fina" line.

The 1970s were years of consolidation for the company, which started to produce pasta for the North and Northeast regions, reaching leadership in these regions. In 1972, the cream cracker became one of the most popular products. In 1976, the new headquarters of Fábrica Fortaleza began to be built on BR-116, km 18, in the municipality of Eusébio (CE), on a plot of 600,000 m², which is currently one of the largest biscuit and pasta factories in Latin America. With the launch of the "Richester" line in 1978, the company reached new levels of sales, increasing its market share even more.

In 1980, the construction of the new facilities for the biscuit and pasta factory, in the municipality of Eusébio (CE), was completed, maintaining the name "Fábrica Fortaleza". With the new facilities, the company further expands its production and operations in the North-Northeast market. To improve the quality of its products, the company created in 1985 the Research and Analysis Center – CPA for certification and development of new products. In 1991 the company robotizes the packaging systems of its products.

In 1992, M. Dias Branco expands its activities and inaugurates its first wheat milling and wheat flour and bran production unit, becoming the largest mill in Brazil in terms of wheat and by-product storage capacity. This investment represented the first step towards verticalizing the company's biscuit and pasta production process. In 1999 the company launches the snack Tot's.

In 2000 the company obtains the ISO 9000 certification and is elected by Exame magazine as the best company in the segment in Brazil. Also in 2000, the company inaugurated a new wheat milling unit, called Grande Moinho Potiguar, in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, and began the construction of a new industrial unit, comprising a wheat mill, a biscuit factory, a masses and a private mixed-use port. This complex is called Grande Moinho Aratu, and is located in the state of Bahia. In 2002, a new industrial unit was inaugurated, dedicated to the manufacture of margarine and vegetable shortenings, taking the second step towards deepening the verticalization of the biscuit and pasta production process. At this time, the Company already produced its own wheat flour and its own vegetable fat, two of the main inputs in the production of cookies and pasta.

In 2003, Empresa Adria Alimentos do Brasil Ltda, headquartered in the city of São Caetano do Sul (SP), is absorbed by M.Dias Branco. With this acquisition, M Dias Branco S/A added to its production structure the four industrial units then owned by Adria, headquartered in (São Caetano do Sul-SP), (Bento Gonçalves-RS), (Jaboticabal-SP) and ( Sheets Paulista-SP). This acquisition gave M. Dias Branco the outstanding leadership in the biscuit and pasta markets in Brazil (according to Ac Nielsen), adding the Adria, Zabet, Isabela and Basilar brands to its portfolio. In the same year, two more mixed manufacturing and logistics complexes (mill, factory and distribution center), located in the state of Bahia and Paraíba, enter into operation.

The year 2006 was one of the most important in the history of M. Dias Branco S/A, due to its IPO, with the start of trading of its shares on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (BOVESPA), and entry into the Novo Mercado, at the highest level of corporate governance required in the Brazilian capital market. With this initiative, approximately 18% of the Company's capital stock passed, through a secondary offering of shares, into the hands of Brazilian and foreign investors.

On April 7, 2008, the company acquired, through its subsidiary Adria Alimentos do Brasil Ltda, the entire capital stock of the Pernambuco company Indústria de Alimentos Bom Gosto Ltda, known for its main brand, Vitarella. With this acquisition, M Dias Branco S/A expanded its significant leadership in the Brazilian pasta and cookies market, consolidating itself even more as the largest Brazilian company in this area. In November 2000, Indústrias de Alimentos Bomgosto Ltda - Vitarella - became directly controlled by M Dias Branco S/A.
