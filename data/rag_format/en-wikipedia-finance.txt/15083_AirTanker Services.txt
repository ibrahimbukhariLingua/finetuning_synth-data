AirTanker Services


# AirTanker Services



**AirTanker Services Limited**, incorporated in England and Wales on 14 June 2007 with the company registration number 06279646, is a private limited company in the United Kingdom (UK), which operates a British airline known as **AirTanker** (IATA: **9L**, ICAO: **TOW**, call sign: **TOWLINE**), and is also an aircraft leasing and operating company.

Under contract to the Government of the United Kingdom, **AirTanker Holdings Limited** (company registration number 06279650, incorporated on 14 June 2007; 17 years ago (2007-06-14)), owns a fleet of fourteen Airbus A330 MRTT multi-role tanker transport aircraft (based upon existing civilian A330-243 wide-body passenger airliner (type code A332), retro-converted to military specification by Airbus Military, now part of Airbus Defence and Space) primarily for military operations by the Royal Air Force (RAF). In turn, **AirTanker Services Limited** operate those fourteen aircraft for the Royal Air Force, known by the British military service name **Voyager**, as the RAF's now sole type of tanker aircraft for aerial refuelling, whilst simultaneously being able to operate as military troop and cargo transport, and also configurable for military aeromedical roles. For additional revenue, AirTanker Services Limited is able to operate as a civilian airline named AirTanker (identified by ICAO code: TOW), using any reserve aircraft on short-term air charter, or longer-term damp-lease or wet lease arrangements to other civilian airlines for commercial gain.

AirTanker Services Limited (ATS) *and* AirTanker Holdings Limited (ATH) are both owned by a consortium (in varying percentage stakes for each company); consisting of Airbus, Rolls-Royce plc (23.5% ATS, and previously 23.1% ATH), Equitix Investment Management Limited (23.1% ATH), Cobham plc, Babcock International, and Thales Group. AirTanker Services Limited and AirTanker Holdings Limited both have their headquarters and registered office at AirTanker Hub, RAF Brize Norton, Carterton, Oxfordshire, England, OX18 3LX.


## Overview

In March 2008, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) signed the finalised Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) contract with AirTanker Holdings Limited (ATH) (the legal owner of the aircraft) to provide the Royal Air Force (RAF) with an air transport and air-to-air refuelling capability. The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft contract stipulated the supply of fourteen Airbus A330 MRTT (A330-243), with all fourteen airframes being converted to the full Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) tanker specification. This new capability was to provide a modern replacement for the RAF's then ageing fleet of aerial refuelling tankers; namely the Vickers VC10 and Lockheed TriStar. In addition to its primary role of supporting the Royal Air Force, AirTanker Services Limited (ATS) (the legal operator of the civilian AirTanker airline) also holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Type A Global operating licence, permitting it to operate as revenue-generating civilian airline; capable of carrying fare-paying passengers, cargo, and mail, on aircraft with twenty or more seats.

Prior to the delivery of the aircraft to the Royal Air Force, new facilities were constructed RAF Brize Norton (IATA: BZZ, ICAO: EGVN) in Oxfordshire, the RAF's largest airbase. Known as AirTanker Hub, these facilities are owned by industry, and act as headquarters and registered office for both ATH and ATS, and contain all support services for operation and maintenance of the AirTanker fleet. In accordance with the dual military and civilian roles, all fourteen aircraft in the fleet must be able to switch between the United Kingdom's Civil Aircraft Register (CAR), and its Military Aircraft Register (MAR). They are thus dual registered, and individually identified by a UK civilian aircraft registration mark (starting at G-VYGA, as an abbreviated homage to its Voyager military service name, through to G-VYGN), *and* a UK military aircraft registration (starting in series with ZZ330, as a nod to its Airbus A330 type, through to ZZ343); although only one type of registration mark is displayed, dependent on its operator. The airframe with the manufacturers' construction number 1555 is a notable example: when first delivered to the Royal Air Force after its military conversion to an MRTT in 26 June 2015, it was military registered ZZ341, and was displayed as such at the 2015 Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT); by June 2017, it had been 'demilitarised' (removal of its aerial refuelling external hardware, its external CCTV cameras, and its internal tanker mission operators station; and extra passenger seats installed), and leased to a commercial operator with the civilian registration G-VYGL.

On 12 May 2012, Sponsored Reservists (members of the Royal Air Force, but salaried by commercial companies) of No. 10 Squadron RAF (nicknamed Shiny Ten) for AirTanker Services Limited began Royal Air Force operations of its Airbus A330 MRTT (role-specific militarised conversion of the civilian A330-243 airliner by Airbus Military at its Getafe facility near Madrid in Spain), known by the RAF as the Voyager, by operating a military air transport sortie to RAF Akrotiri (IATA: AKT, ICAO: LCRA) in Cyprus from its home airbase of RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, England.

Following the issue of an air operating licence by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, the airline flew its first charter flight to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus for the UK Ministry of Defence in January 2013. After delays in certification due to issues with its refuelling drogue baskets, its first operational aerial refuelling flight took place on 20 May 2013; 11 years ago (2013-05-20). Following subsequent successful Voyager tanker aerial fuel delivery operations to all operational Royal Air Force, and allied receiver aircraft, in late 2013, No. 101 Squadron RAF retired all their remaining Vickers VC10s and became the second RAF flying squadron alongside 10 Squadron to operate the Voyager.

From October 2013, AirTanker's civilian pilots and flight crews started to provide the twice-weekly scheduled passenger flights using a demodified unmilitarised Voyager aircraft (A330-243, currently G-VYGJ) with a single-class cabin of 291 premium economy seats between RAF Brize Norton in the United Kingdom and RAF Mount Pleasant (IATA: MPN, ICAO: EGYP) on the Falkland Islands, known as the South Atlantic Air Bridge, a distance of more than 7,900 miles (6,900 nautical miles; 12,700 kilometres); mainly for the movement of military personnel and contractors, military cargo, and civilian freight, though fare-paying civilian passengers are also allowed to travel. These air bridge flights originally stopped mid-journey for ground refuelling at Wideawake Airfield (IATA: ASI, ICAO: FHAW) on RAF Ascension Island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean; but due to the deteriorating condition of its runway, the refuelling stop was transferred to Cape Verdeʷʰⁱᶜʰ? (from October 2019 to March 2020). During the COVID-19 pandemic, this refuelling stop was moved to Blaise Diagne International Airport (IATA: DSS, ICAO: GOBD) in Dakar, west Africa, from April to September 2020. However, in early June 2020, an AirTanker A330-243 civilian registration: G-VYGM, the thirteenth and penultimate Voyager (MSN: 1601) set a new record by flying non-stop direct from Brize Norton to Mount Pleasant without refuelling. Captained by Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot Dave Hall, a former RAF Vickers VC10 pilot, now a 10 Squadron sponsored reservist RAF pilot, departing on 2 June from RAF Brize Norton, it completed the non-stop total distance of 12,657 kilometres (6,834 nautical miles; 7,865 miles) to RAF Mount Pleasant in fifteen hours nine minutes; breaking the previous record by thirty-six minutes, set in 1987 by an RAF Vickers VC10. Its return journey, departing Mount Pleasant on 5 June was also completed non-stop. Following major repairs to the runway at Wideawake Airfield by US contractors, ground refuelling stops resumed at RAF Ascension Island in May 2023. More recent non-stop flights from Brize Norton to Mount Pleasant and return have been made by the civilian-crewed G-VYGJ; BZZ to MPN on 19 November 2023 in 19 hours 14 minutes, 6 December 2023 in 18:57, 6 June 2024 in 18:30, 20 June 2024 in 18:27, 29 July 2024 in 18:43, 6 October 2024 in 18:50, and 4 November 2024 in 18:23.

From late 2014, up to two AirTanker Holdings Limited RAF Voyager KC3 aircraft (currently ZZ333 and ZZ334) operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) have been involved in combat missions in support of Operation Shader. They are tasked for tanker sorties supplying AAR fuel to Typhoon FGR4s and F-35Bs of the Royal Air Force, AV-8B Harriers and F/A-18 Hornets of the US Marine Corps, along with other probe-equipped coalition receiver aircraft. These Op Shader Voyagers are assigned to No. 903 Expeditionary Air Wing (903 EAW), based at RAF Akrotiri in the Sovereign Base Area on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

In May 2015, AirTanker Holdings Limited leased one demodified demilitarised A330-243 aircraft (civilian registration: G-VYGK, MSN: 1498) to Thomas Cook Airlines to be deployed on holiday routes. The contract ran for three years, and involved mainly long-haul flights from Glasgow Airport (IATA: GLA, ICAO: EGPF), Manchester Airport (IATA: MAN, ICAO: EGCC), and London Stansted Airport (IATA: STN, ICAO: EGSS) in the United Kingdom. The first commercial flight took place on 1 May 2015; 9 years ago (2015-05-01), from Manchester to Cancun (IATA: CUN, ICAO: MMUN) in Mexico and Punta Cana (IATA: PUJ, ICAO: MDPC) in the Dominican Republic. In April 2017, a second aircraft (G-VYGM, MSN: 1601) was also leased to Thomas Cook Airlines; in May 2019, G-VYGM was then leased to Jet2.com, following a different aircraft (G-VYGL, MSN: 1555) being leased to Jet2.com in June 2017.

During early 2016, an existing RAF Voyager KC3 aircraft (military registration: ZZ336, MSN: 1363) was further converted to VIP fitment for use by members of the British Royal Family, the Prime Minister, and senior members of the UK Government. Whilst still retaining its original core military function of aerial refuelling tanker and military transport, ZZ336's passenger cabin was reconfigured to include fifty-eight business class seats up front in a dual-aisle one-two-one configuration, retaining one-hundred premium economy standard-class seats in the standard two-four-two configuration rear cabin. The VIP upgrade also included secure satellite communications system, missile detection, secure weapons storage, and media facilities, similar to other dedicated air transports of heads of state and government. This VIP Voyager originally retained its military low-visibility matt-grey exterior paint scheme, identical to the remainder of the RAF Voyager KC2 and KC3 fleet. During mid-2020, as part of its programmed mid-life upgrades and major servicing, ZZ336 was repainted in gloss-white 'Global Britain' livery, which includes a stylised Union Jack on its tail fin and winglets, gold United Kingdom lettering, but retaining its Royal Air Force name, RAF roundels, and prominent military aircraft registration. When returned to service with the RAF, it was given the name *Vespina* by the Royal Air Force.

On 13 July 2016; 8 years ago (2016-07-13), AirTanker Holdings Limited reached the final establishment phase milestone in the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) programme; with the achievement of Full Service Date on time and on budget, delivering all fourteen A330-243 MRTT aircraft to the Royal Air Force on behalf of the UK government.

In 2017, AirTanker Services Limited established a new operating base at Manchester Airport to support its AirTanker civilian leasing operations for its demodified demilitarised A330-243 aircraft. The same year, members of AirTankers' cabin crew were seconded to Thomas Cook Airlines, fostering its existing relationship and facilitating training of A330 cabin crew for Thomas Cook Airlines.

In 2022, AirTanker Services Limited was awarded a contract by Airbus Defence and Space, on behalf of the European Defence Agency (EDA), who are the operator of the Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF), for its fleet of Airbus A330 MRTT as used by six NATO partner nations. This was to provide engineering support services to the Netherlands-based, but Luxembourg-registered Multinational MRTT Fleet. The contract agreement is for a work share between AirTanker and Airbus Defence and Space for three specific support services; these include Rolls-Royce Trent 772B-60 engine support, Cobham flight refuelling pod support, and maintenance.


## Personnel and support

AirTanker Holdings Limited owns the entire fleet of fourteen Airbus A330-243 aircraft under the terms of its contract with the UK government. AirTanker Services Limited operate the aircraft, and also provides full support infrastructure to service and maintain the aircraft fleet, operational management, personnel training, and some specific aircraft crews. For Royal Air Force operations (identified by its ICAO airline designator: RAF), this latter includes military pilots and engineers who are classed as 'Sponsored Reservists'.

Its surge fleet, the demodified demilitarised A330-243 aircraft, used as civilian air charter or wet lease, are operated by AirTanker civilian pilots, but draw cabin crew from the respective civilian airline they operate for.


## Fleet

AirTanker Holdings Limited has a 27-year contract to provide fourteen aircraft. All airframes are the Airbus A330 MRTT; based upon the A330-243 civilian airliner with a dual-aisle, two-four-two passenger cabin, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent 772B-60 turbofan jet engines, each with a rated take-off thrust of 316.3 kilonewtons (71,107 pounds-force) and a continuous rating of 282.7 kilonewtons (63,553 pounds-force). Each aircraft can carry a total fuel load of 111 tonnes (109 long tons; 122 short tons). The RAF Voyagers are able to dispense 50,000 kilograms (110,231 pounds) of fuel, from its existing wing and fuselage fuel tanks, to receiver aircraft via its hose-and-drogue systems. They have a loiter time of up to four hours, and a range of more than 1,852 kilometres (1,151 miles) from its departure airbase.

The AirTanker Holdings Limited fleet originally consisted of a 'core' fleet of nine military aircraft; eight with UK military registration marks (starting in series with ZZ330, as a nod to its Airbus A330 type) and one UK civilian registration (G-VYGJ, permanently used for the South Atlantic Air Bridge), along with a 'surge' fleet of five UK civil registered demodified demilitarised aircraft (similar to A330-243 standard configuration) which it uses for additional revenue. The surge fleet can be recalled for military use at any time as required. This fleet balance was subsequently revised; the military-registered core fleet was increased to ten aircraft, and the civilian-registered surge fleet reducing to four.


### Versions

The AirTanker Holdings Limited-owned fleet of fourteen aircraft are known by the following official nomenclature, as defined by their primary operator (identified by its ICAO airline designator code):


#### Royal Air Force (RAF)

Primarily operated by Royal Air Force (RAF) military Sponsored Reservist pilots and cabin crew of 10 Squadron and 101 Squadron, along with 1312 Flight of the RAF by AirTanker Services Limited. All aircraft (excluding the gloss-white VIP converted Vespina) are externally painted in a low-visibility matt-grey livery, with RAF insignia and roundels, identified by their British military aircraft registration mark:

* Voyager KC2 — qty 3 – Airbus A330 MRTT – militarised A330-243 with two under-wing outboard Cobham 905E hose and drogue refuelling pods, suitable for supplying fuel to probe-equipped small fast-jet combat aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado, Eurofighter Typhoon, and Lockheed Martin F-35B.
* Voyager KC3 — qty 7 – identical to the KC2, but with an additional centreline Cobham 805E Fuselage Refuelling Unit (FRU) suitable for supplying fuel in larger volumes at higher delivery rate to probe-equipped larger military transport aircraft and mission-specific military converted civilian airliners, such as the Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules and Airbus A400M Atlas.

#### AirTanker (TOW)

Operated by AirTanker Services Limited civilian pilots and cabin crew. Dependent on primary mission (typically wet lease or damp lease), these are externally painted white with lessor airline logos, or low-visibility matt-grey (identical to the RAF Voyagers) with AirTanker logos for the individual airframe (currently G-VYGJ) permanently tasked for the South Atlantic Air Bridge. All aircraft are identified by their British civilian aircraft registration mark:

* A330-243 — qty 4 – demodified demilitarised A330 MRTT, operating purely as a civilian passenger airliner for short-term air charter or longer-term wet or damp lease.

**Notes:**

1. The dates in service indicate the point in time when each aircraft was delivered to its operator at RAF Brize Norton, specifically as a Voyager following conversion of an existing civilian airliner by Airbus Military into its full MRTT specification; these airframes were individually manufactured some years earlier, the oldest airframe taking its first flight (as a civilian airliner prior to MRTT conversion) on 4 June 2009.
2. One RAF Voyager KC3 (currently ZZ337) is permanently based at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands as part of No. 1312 Flight RAF, to provide aerial refuelling for its 1312 Flt stablemate A400M Atlas C1 (currently ZM421 since September 2024, replacing ZM417; and its former C-130 Hercules) transport aircraft, along with the four quick reaction alert (QRA) Typhoon FGR4 fighter jets of No. 1435 Flight RAF. An additional demilitarised A330-243 operated by AirTanker is used twice weekly to provide the air bridge between RAF Brize Norton in the UK and RAF Mount Pleasant in the South Atlantic.

## Accidents and incidents

On Sunday 9 February 2014, an RAF Voyager KC3, registration ZZ333, MSN 1312, was tasked with an air transport flight from RAF Brize Norton (IATA: BZZ, ICAO: EGVN) in Oxfordshire to Camp Bastion (IATA: QOZ, ICAO: OAZI) in Afghanistan. With the call sign ISF 63JW, operated by a crew of nine, and carrying 189 passengers, ZZ333 departed BZZ at 12:00 UTC for an estimated flight duration of eight hours twenty minutes. At 15:49 UTC, whilst over the Black Sea in Turkish airspace during hours of darkness, ZZ333 rapidly lost 4,440 feet (1,350 metres) of altitude in 27 seconds from its autopilot-controlled cruising altitude of 33,000 feet (10,000 metres), and reaching a maximum descent rate of 15,800 feet per minute (4,800 metres per minute). A maximum indicated air speed of 358 knots (663 kilometres per hour; 412 miles per hour), or Mach 0.9, was recorded during this descent while the co-pilot was out of the cockpit making a hot beverage in the forward galley. The co-pilot returned to the cockpit to a scene of disarray, audible alarms, and "violent shaking" of the aircraft. He reached over to his right-hand side-stick, pulling back to regain control of the aircraft. The sudden descent caused several injuries to twenty-five passengers and seven crew, some of whom struck the ceiling of the aircraft; they were attended by medical personnel onboard as passengers on the flight. A maximum g-force of minus 0.56 g was recorded at the start of the dive, and plus 2.06 g during the recovery to level flight. After gaining control, the aircraft diverted to Incirlik Air Base (IATA: UAB, ICAO: LTAG) in Turkey and landed without further incident. The incident resulted in the grounding of the entire RAF Voyager fleet for twelve days, until it was determined by a United Kingdom Military Aviation Authority (UK-MAA) report following an investigation by the Military Air Accidents Investigation Branch (MilAAIB) at Farnborough on 14 February 2014 that the event was caused by the captain's improperly stowed DSLR camera being jammed between the captain's armrest and the side-stick controller, forcing the stick forward when the captain adjusted his seat forward.
