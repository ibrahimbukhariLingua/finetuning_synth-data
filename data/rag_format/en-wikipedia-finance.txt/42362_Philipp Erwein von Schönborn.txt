Philipp Erwein von Schönborn


# Philipp Erwein von Schönborn



**Philipp Erwein, *Freiherr* von Schönborn zu Freienfels-Eschbach** (1607 – 4 November 1668), was a German nobleman who is considered the founder of the economic success of the Counts of Schönborn.


## Early life

Philipp Erwein was born in Eschbach, Südliche Weinstraße, in 1607. He was a son of Maria Barbara von der Leyen and Georg von Schönborn (d. 1613), who served as Bailiff (Viscount) of the Protestant County of Wied-Runkel in 1605. The family lived in a manor house at Laubuseschbach (present-day Hesse). Among his siblings were elder brother, Johann Philipp von Schönborn, a mediator during the Peace of Westphalia negotiations (that ended the Thirty Years' War) which led to his election as the Archbishop of Mainz, and sister, Agatha Maria von Schönborn, wife of Georg Anton Waldbott von Bassenheim.

The Schönborn family had knightly rank and was first mentioned in 1275. However, by the time Philipp Erwein and his brother Johann Philipp grew up, most branches of the family had extinguished. In 1640, the brothers were bequeathed a sizeable fortune by their cousin, Friedrich Georg von Schönborn, a money lender to the Archbishop of Mainz and "Senior of the diocese of Mainz".


## Career

His brother, Johann Philipp, appointed him as the Electorate of Mainz's chief magistrate at Steinheim, as the Hereditary Cupbearer of the Archbishopric of Mainz and as the Hereditary Cupbearer of the Bishopric of Würzburg. Emperor Leopold I granted him, and all his descendants, the title of noble standard-bearer (German: *Bannerherr*) and made him a *Freiherr* (Baron) of the Empire. At the same time, he was granted the great palatine title and extensive privileges. He also bore the titles of Imperial Court Councillor and Privy Councillor of the Electorate of Mainz.

In 1650, he acquired the town of Gaibach, including Gaibach Castle and the right of patronage over the local parish church. In 1657, he was recorded as the owner of the House of Stone (German: *Haus zum Stein*), the oldest preserved and inhabited building in Mainz.

He was Burgrave of Frauenstein Castle until 1662. On 30 August 1661, Philipp Erwein received the feudal charter for the Court of Blood Justice in Heusenstamm from Emperor Leopold. Between 1663 and 1668, he built Heusenstamm Castle in front of the moated castle of the former Lords of Heusenstamm. Through inheritance, purchase and fiefdom, he also acquired land and property on both sides of the Rhine, on the Main, in the Taunus and the Wetterau.


## Personal life

In 1635, he was married to Baroness Maria Ursula von Greiffenclau-Vollraths [de] (d. 1682), a daughter of Baron Heinrich von Greiffenclau-Volrads and Anna Maria von und zu Eltz. Together, they were the parents of twelve children, including:

* Maria Ursula von Schönborn (1636–1677), who married Baron Heinrich Fredrich Wambold von Umstadt.

Philipp Erwein died in Geisenheim on 4 November 1668. His tomb in the parish church of Geisenheim was reportedly created by Matthias Rauchmiller. He was succeeded by his son, Johann Erwein, who was only 14 years old at the time of his death. When Johann Erwein died in 1705, he was succeeded by his elder brother, Melchior Friedrich.
