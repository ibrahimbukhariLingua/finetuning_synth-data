## History

Orkuveita Reykjavíkur was established 1 January 1999, by uniting Rafmagnsveita Reykjavíkur and Hitaveita Reykjavíkur. Rafmagnsveita Reykjavíkur was established in the year 1921. Hitaveita Reykjavíkur became an independent company in 1946, having been in operation as a City entity since 1930.
