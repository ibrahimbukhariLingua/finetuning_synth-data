## History

The company's roots lie in the foundation in 1992 of Emissionshaus Nordcapital by Erck Rickmers and his brother Bertram Rickmers.
Initially run together, the brothers parted company in 1996, with Erck Rickmers continuing to manage Nordcapital and founding the shipping company E.R. Schiffahrt two years later. The company's first new build was the container ship *E.R. Hamburg*, brought into service in September 1998 with a capacity of 2,226 TEU.

In the beginning, E.R. Schiffahrt focused on the operation and chartering of container vessels, but from 2006 expanded into operating offshore vessels and Bulk carriers. In January 2008, Erck Rickmers merged shipping companies E.R. Schiffahrt and E.R. Offshore, along with investment company Nordcapital, under the umbrella of E.R. Capital Holding.

In 2012, E.R. Schiffahrt merged with ship management company Komrowski and its subsidiary Blue Star under the umbrella of Blue Star Holding. The umbrella company's capital majority is held by E.R. Capital Holding.


## Fleet

E.R. Schiffahrt operates a fleet of more than 90 vessels, among them four Ultra large container ships and more than forty Post-Panamax Class container ships.
