While private banks like Dutch Bangla Bank Limited and BRAC Bank Limited have booths all over the country, the bank is holding limited space here though it is one of the largest foreign banks in Bangladesh. It has branches in Bogra, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Savar and Sylhet. They have ATM booths almost all over Dhaka and Chittagong.


## History

After the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, Standard Chartered started its business in what is now Bangladesh in 1948, in the port city of Chittagong.

In a move that Standard Chartered said transformed it into the largest foreign bank in Bangladesh, it acquired Grindlays Bank from ANZ in August 2000. In doing so, it gained an operational history in the country dating back to 1905. In 2005, Standard Chartered bought out the Bangladesh banking operations of American Express.
