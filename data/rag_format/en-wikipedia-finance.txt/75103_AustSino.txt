In April 2014, reached an agreement with businessman Roland Bleyer to fund a port and railway project in Oakajee. However, due to disparaging press coverage of Bleyer's past business dealings, the project was put on hold.

Bleyer criticised this decision, adding the project would have "created jobs for the working man that needs to feed his family."
