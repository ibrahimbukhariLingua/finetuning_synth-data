Association of Business Trial Lawyers


# Association of Business Trial Lawyers



The **Association of Business Trial Lawyers** (ABTL), founded in 1973, is a voluntary bar association with members in five chapters throughout California, including Los Angeles, Northern California, Orange County, San Diego, and the San Joaquin Valley. ABTL's membership includes business litigators from both plaintiff and defense practices and judges and justices (federal and state, trial and appellate). The ABTL provides a forum in which litigators and jurists meet to address issues important to both commercial trial lawyers and the judicial bench.


## Programs

ABTL provides a forum for presentations on relevant legal issues, demonstrations of trial and litigation strategies, and discussion of issues faced by business litigators advocating and jurists deciding business cases. ABTL has been certified by the State Bar of California to provide continuing legal education programs and credits.
