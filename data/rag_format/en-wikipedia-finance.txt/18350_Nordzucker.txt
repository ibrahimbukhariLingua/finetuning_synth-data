## History

The roots of the company date back to the year 1838, when the Klein Wanzleben plant, the first plant of the company that is still in service today, was founded.

The Nordzucker AG was formed by the merger of the Braunschweig-based Zuckerverbund Nord AG (ZVN) and the Uelzen-based Zucker-Aktiengesellschaft Uelzen-Braunschweig (ZAG) in 1997.

Between 1999 and 2003, Nordzucker expanded to Eastern Europe and acquired its Polish plants Chełmża and Opalenica and its Slovakian plant Trenčianska Teplá.

In 2003, the Nordstemmen-based Union-Zucker Südhannover GmbH was integrated into the Group.

In March 2009, Nordzucker acquired the Copenhagen-based sugar manufacturer **Nordic Sugar** A/S (formerly known as Danisco Sugar) for EUR 730 million. Nordic Sugar runs sugar plants in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Lithuania.

In February 2014, the Federal Cartel Office imposed a joint fine of 280 million euros on the company together with its competitors Südzucker and Pfeifer & Langen for anti-competitive agreements. Numerous customers filed suits for damages.

Nordzucker Group acquired a 70% stake in Mackay Sugar Limited in 2019 (Australia)

In February 2019, Nordzucker announced the acquisition of 70 percent of the shares in Mackay Sugar Limited (MSL), based in Mackay, Australia's second largest sugar producer. MSL also has a 25 percent interest in Sugar Australia and New Zealand Sugar, a sugar refining joint venture in Australia and New Zealand with Wilmar International.
