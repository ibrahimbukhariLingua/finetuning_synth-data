# Scandlines



**Scandlines** is a ferry company that operates the Rødby–Puttgarden and Gedser–Rostock ferry routes between Denmark and Germany.

Scandlines owns seven ferries, six of which are hybrid ferries, making Scandlines the owner of the world's largest fleet of hybrid ferries. It has two subsidiaries, Scandlines Danmark ApS and Scandlines Deutschland GmbH, which operate in the two main countries.


## History

In 1903, the first railway ferry sailed between Gedser in Denmark and Warnemünde in Germany, where DSB operated the route from the Danish side in partnership with a state-owned German shipping company.

A second service, the 'bird's flight line' (die Vogelfluglinie in German) between Rødby and Puttgarden was added in 1963, creating a direct route between Copenhagen and Hamburg.

The company was separated from DSB in 1995, and transformed into an independent limited company called DSB Rederi, which was, in turn, rebranded Scandlines in 1997. The Scandlines brand had already been in use since 1991 on the Helsingør–Helsingborg ferry route In 1998, the two shipping company partners, Danish Scandlines and German DFO, merged to form Scandlines, owned by the Danish Ministry of Transport and Deutsche Bahn.

Scandlines was privatised in 2007 with 3i and Allianz Capital owning 40% each and Deutsche Seereederei 20%. In 2010 Deutsche Seereederei sold its shareholding to 3i and Allianz. In 2013 Allianz sold its 49% to 3i. In 2018 First Sentier Investors and Hermes Investment Management acquired 50% and 15% shareholdings.

Between 1999 and 2015, some of Scandlines' routes were sold, including Aarhus-Kalundborg to Molslinjen, and Helsingør-Helsingborg to ForSea Ferries.

Scandlines operates two routes; Gedser to Rostock and Rødby to Puttgarden. Scandlines expects to continue operating on the Rødby–Puttgarden route despite the planned completion of the Fehmarn Belt tunnel in 2029.
