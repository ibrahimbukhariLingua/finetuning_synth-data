## History


### Founding

Korean Air, which was acquired by Hanjin Transportation in 1969, had a monopoly on the South Korean airline industry until the establishment of Asiana in 1988. Asiana's formation did not come about as a policy initiative favoring liberalized market conditions, but rather because of pressure from other *chaebols* and interests that wanted to compete. It was formed by the Kumho Asiana Group (formerly Kumho Group) and was originally known as Seoul Air International. Asiana was established on 17 February 1988 and started operations in December 1988 with flights to Busan. As of 2007, the airline was owned by domestic private investors (30.53%), Kumho Industrial (29.51%), Kumho Petrochemical (15.05%), foreign investors (11.9%), Korea Development Bank (7.18%), and others (5.83%).


### Beginning regular service

Asiana began operations in December 1988, using Boeing 737 Classic aircraft, with flights to Busan and Gwangju. In 1989, Asiana began regular services to Jeju City, Gwangju, and Daegu, and later the same year, began international chartered flights to Sendai in Japan. In 1990, Asiana began its first scheduled international services, to the Japanese cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Sendai, and Fukuoka. In the same year, Asiana had nine Boeing 747-400s, 20 Boeing 767-300s, and eight Boeing 737-400s. In early 1991, Asiana began services to Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taipei. Transpacific flights to Los Angeles began in December 1991 with a Boeing 747-400 Combi. Services to Vienna, Brussels, and Honolulu began in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Asiana began services in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.


### Expansion as a global carrier and joining Star Alliance

Asiana Airlines has rapidly expanded since its establishment in 1988 to become a mid-sized global carrier with a fleet of 85 aircraft. In December 1998, the airline operated an aircraft on behalf of the president of South Korea for the first time. The airline was listed in KOSDAQ In December 1999. On 28 January 2003, the airline became a full Star Alliance member, expanding its worldwide network and global brand. In 2004, the airline added Airbus A330s and the Boeing 777-200ERs to its fleet and expanded its routes into mainland China. Currently, it provides international services to 71 cities in 23 countries on 91 routes and domestic services to 12 cities on 14 routes. It also provides international cargo services to 29 cities in 14 countries on 28 routes by Asiana Cargo, the airline's freight division. In 2012, the airline had net sales of US$5.3 billion.


### New corporate identity

In February 2006, Asiana Airlines modernized its corporate identity for unification with those of other divisions of its parent company the Kumho Asiana Group. The names of the travel classes have changed from first, business, and economy classes to first, business, and travel classes, respectively, and the colors of the travel classes have changed to yellow, blue, and red for first, business, and travel, respectively. New uniforms were also created for the crew.


### Notable achievements

Asiana began to focus on being an environmentally friendly company in the mid-1990s, leading to decisions such as completely banning in-flight smoking and cigarette sales in 1995. The company was awarded first-in-class certification by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for meeting the criteria for ISO 14001 in 1996. In 2001, Asiana Airlines was recognized for being the "first environmentally friendly company within the service industry" by the South Korean Ministry of Environment. Some of Asiana's other environmentally minded programs include an emissions measurement and reduction system; reducing pollution from ground facilities; and partnering with the Rainforest Alliance for coffee served on board.

* In 2009, *Air Transport World* awarded Asiana its Airline of the Year award, a coveted and one of the most honorable awards in the airline industry.
* In 2010, Asiana Airlines was named Airline of the Year by Skytrax at the 2010 World Airline Awards.
* In 2011, *Global Traveller* awarded the airline 2011 Airline of the Year and the top airliner in six other categories.
* In 2012, *Business Traveller* named the airline the 2012 Best Overall Airline in the World.

With these achievements attained over four consecutive years, Asiana Airlines is recognized as a Golden Grand Slam Airline, the first airline to achieve this. Apart from this prestigious title, the company has received the Best Airline for Onboard Service and Flight Attendants for eight consecutive years, among other awards. Asiana Airlines is rated as a "5-Star" airline by Skytrax.


### Financial crisis

In April 2019, Asiana Airlines' parent company, Kumho Asiana Group, announced its plan to sell Asiana Airlines as a solution to its financial crisis.

The sale of Asiana Airlines began in July 2019. In June 2019, Aekyung Group, the parent company of Korean low-cost carrier Jeju Air, was considered as a strong candidate to take over. Korean Air's parent company, Hanjin Group, and SK Group also considered purchasing.

Asiana Airlines discontinued unprofitable routes throughout July 2019 to October 2019, including Seoul–Incheon to Chicago–O'Hare, Delhi, Khabarovsk and Sakhalinsk.

On 25 July 2019, Kumho Asiana Group, the parent company of Asiana Airlines, officially announced its intention to sell Asiana Airlines for an estimated price of 1.5 to 2.0 trillion won (US$1.26 to 1.68 billion). Asiana Airlines includes subsidiaries Air Busan, Air Seoul, Asiana IDT and other subsidiary companies. AeKyeong Group, the parent company of Jeju Air, has expressed interest in acquiring Asiana Airlines.

On 4 September 2019, Aekyung Group, Mirae Asset Daewoo, and Korea Corporate Governance Improvement applied a letter of intent to acquire Asiana Airlines. On 12 November, a consortium of HDC Hyundai Development Company and Mirae Asset Daewoo was selected as the preferred bidder.

Asiana Airlines has chosen to retire older aircraft, including Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 767-300s, allowing the airline to reduce debt and weakness.

In July 2020, HDC Hyundai Development Company received approval from Russian authorities for its acquisition of Asiana Airlines. However, on 11 September 2020, Korea Development Bank, the primary creditor for Asiana Airlines, and Kumho Asiana Group officially canceled the merger with HDC Hyundai Development Company. Asiana Airlines will be run by creditors until a new owner is approved by the South Korean government.


### Merger with Korean Air

On 16 November 2020, the Government of the Republic of Korea announced a policy of merging Asiana Airlines with Korean Air, which would acquire a 30.77% stake in Asiana from Korea Development Bank. The Korean state-run bank would invest 800 billion won (US$600 million) to Hanjin KAL, the holding company of Korean Air, to fund the merger. The two airlines would operate as separate brands until integration is complete. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport planned to integrate subsidiaries Air Busan, Air Seoul, and Jin Air into a new low-cost airline. The combined low-cost carrier will focus on regional airports within South Korea and flying regional Asia-Pacific routes.


### 2021

In March 2021, Korean Air announced it would delay the merger with Asiana Airlines due to a delay in antitrust approval from the government and six foreign authorities (China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, United States, and Vietnam). Korean Air will operate Asiana Airlines as a subsidiary for the next two years, after which it will combine its operation, IT, and other systems into a single system until 2024. Once the merger is complete, Asiana Airlines could become a member of SkyTeam. According to *The Korea Times*, only Turkey has approved the antitrust deal so far.

On 30 June 2021, the post-merger plans between two airlines were reported to have been finalized and approved by Korea Development Bank.

In August 2021, the Malaysian Aviation Commission approved the merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, citing economic efficiencies and social benefits.

On 16 November 2021, it was announced that Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam had approved Korean Air's acquisition of smaller local rival Asiana Airlines Inc.


### 2022

On 26 December 2022, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China announced its approval of Korean Air's business combination with Asiana Airlines.


### 2023

The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the deal in May 2023 citing monopoly concerns. In November 2023, Asiana agreed to divest its cargo business in an attempt to appease regulatory concerns.


### 2024

On 28 November 2024, European Commission approved the merger, followed by the approval from the United States on 2 December 2024. Following approval given from all 14 countries, Korean Air officially completed the acquisition of Asiana Airlines on 12 December 2024.

Korean Air Co. said August 7, 2024 it signed a tentative agreement valued at 470 billion won (US$341.7 million) to sell the cargo business division of Asiana Airlines Inc. to Air Incheon.

On 12 December 2024, Reuters reported that Korean Air has announced the completion of the purchase of the debt-laden Asiana Airlines in a deal worth 1.5 trillion won (US$1.6 billion). The deal enables Korean Air to acquire 63.88% in the second largest airline in the country, becoming the 12th largest airline in the world by international capacity.


### 2024-present: After the merger, brand identity changes, and integration to Korean Air in 2026

In December, Asiana Airlines quietly launched its new brand identity after the merger, which includes the removal the “red arrow” elements (also branded as the Asiana Wings) of the previous owner Kumho Asiana Group and using the aircraft tail as a replacement. The Kumho Asiana Group logo on the fuselage has been removed and the red arrows on the all the passenger aircraft in the fleet have also been either removed or covered.

The brand identity of the two airlines will remain unchanged until Q4 2026 and in the meantime, several integration process will be conducted, including appointing a new CEO and key executives, as well as the integration of the low cost subsidiaries of both Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, including Jin Air, Air Busan and Air Seoul. Also, Asiana will end its 38 years of operation and will be integrated to Korean Air in 2026.


## Corporate affairs

The airline has its global headquarters in Seoul at the Asiana Town (아시아나타운) in Osoe-dong, Gangseo-gu, Seoul. The airline's head office moved from Hoehyeon-dong, Jung District to Asiana Town in Osoe-dong on 1 April 1998.


## Destinations

Asiana Airlines serves destinations on five continents, with an Asian network that includes important cities in the People's Republic of China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. The airline serves several gateway cities in North America and Europe while retaining limited coverage of Oceania. Asiana Cargo, the airline's cargo subsidiary, also has a wide network, especially in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

Asiana decided to launch Air Seoul, the airline's second subsidiary and its low-cost carrier, based in Incheon International Airport, and transfer some of its unprofitable routes to the subsidiary in November 2016.

* On 11 November 1998, an Asiana Airlines Boeing 747-400 was attempting a U-turn in the gate area of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport when the tip of its wing collided with the tail of an Ilyushin Il-62M belonging to Aeroflot.

There were no injuries. Asiana Airlines attempted to reward the pilots, but it was discovered that the pilots had intentionally entered the clouds. In addition, when a similar accident occurred a year before this one, a pilot who was a member of a union was disciplined, but since the pilots in this accident were not members of a union, controversy arose and the rewards were eventually canceled.
* On 28 July 2011, Asiana Airlines Cargo Flight 991, a Boeing 747-400F bound for Shanghai Pudong International Airport from Incheon International Airport, crashed into the East China Sea off Jeju Island, South Korea, after reporting a fire in the cargo compartment. Both pilots were killed.

Two of the fatally injured passengers were not wearing their seat belts and were ejected from the aircraft during the crash. The third died in hospital a week after the incident as a result of her injuries. On 25 February 2014, Asiana Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation for "failing to promptly contact passengers' families and keep them informed about their loved ones" during and after the crash.
* On 14 April 2015, Asiana Airlines Flight 162, an Airbus A320 (HL7762), crash landed short of the runway at Hiroshima Airport, Japan.

The aircraft was operating an international scheduled passenger flight from Incheon International Airport, Seoul, South Korea. More than 20 of the 82 people on board were injured. The aircraft was written off.
* On 9 April 2019, Asiana Airlines Flight 8703, an Airbus A320-232 (HL7772), suffered a 90-degree rotation of the nosegear on landing at Gwangju Airport's runway 04R. The tires and flanges suffered serious damage.
* On 26 May 2023, a passenger opened an emergency exit as Asiana Airlines Flight 8124, an Airbus A321-200 (HL8256) was on approach to Daegu International Airport on a flight from Jeju International Airport.
