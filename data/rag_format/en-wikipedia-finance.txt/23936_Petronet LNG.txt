Plans to build a third LNG terminal in Gangavaram, Andhra Pradesh were dropped in October 2019.

Formed as a joint venture by the Government of India to import LNG and set up LNG terminals in the country, it involves India's leading oil and natural gas industry players. Its promoters are GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL), Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). The authorized capital is Rs. 3,000 crore ($420 million approx).

The company selected Gaz de France as its strategic partner. The company has also signed an LNG sale and purchase agreements with QatarEnergy LNG for the supply of 8.5 MTPA LNG to India.

Petronet LNG Ltd has set up its first LNG terminal in Dahej in Gujarat with the capacity of 15 million metric tons per year. Capacity of Dahej Terminal will expand to 17.5 million tons per year till 2019. Another terminal with capacity 5 million tons per year is commissioned in Kochi (Kerala) and started its operations in August 2013. Petronet LNG is planning to set up its third LNG terminal with capacity 5 million tons per year probably in Andhra Pradesh.

Kochi LNG Terminal is situated in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Puthuvypeen near the entrance to Cochin Port, Kerala. The jetty facility at Kochi terminal is designed to receive LNG tankers of capacity from 65,000 m³ up to 216,000 m³, with possibility of receiving suitable smaller ships.

In September 2019, PetroNet signed an MoU with United States–based Tellurian Inc to purchase a stake in the latter's Driftwood project in Louisiana and to import 5 million tonnes of LNG annually. The deal was initially expected to be finalized by 31 March 2020, but the non-binding agreement was instead terminated in November 2020 due to low LNG prices adversely affecting the investment case.

On 6 February 2024, Petronet LNG signed a supply deal with QatarEnergy for 7.5 million metric tons a year of LNG from 2028 to 2048. The agreement was to renew an existing deal with QatarEnergy that expires in 2028 for the same amount of yearly LNG deliveries.

On 20 August 2024, MoU was signed between Sri Lanka's LTL Holdings Limited and India's Petronet LNG Limited for the infrastructure development of the Sobadhanavi Combined Cycle Power Plant at Kerawalapitiya, north Colombo.
