Chen Ping (Sun TV)


# Chen Ping (Sun TV)



**Chen Ping**, the founder of TIDEiSun Group, is a policy maker, intellectual scholar, entrepreneur, owner of SunTV, a Chinese-language media.

In 1984, as one of the young and prominent economic experts and policy makers on China's reform and opening up, he attended the historic Moganshan Conference, convened to build up the transformation of the modern China.

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, he started his career as an international business entrepreneur. In 1992, he established TIDETIME Group in Hong Kong. In 2005, TIDEiSun Group completed the acquisition of SunTV and restructured it into a wholly owned subsidiary media channel, dedicated to the production and broadcasting of independent documentaries and in-depth talk shows focusing on political, social, and economic issues in Chinese society.

Since 2009, Chen Ping has invested in iSunCloud, an encrypted and decentralized cloud storage architecture of security and efficiency. Users of the cloud storage systems become developers and also coordinate with each other to build up a safer and faster data storage mechanism. The idea of establishing a decentralized storage system of automatic computing and communicating networks initiated TIDEiSun Group to conduct a series of research and development efforts in the following decade to create BOLT, TIDEiSun's public blockchain technology.

As an intellectual, Chen Ping published *The Age of Plunder* in 2016. The book explores the current global economic and financial mechanism and the reason that it motivates business monopoly, wealth concentration, and stimulates the continuous expansion of the global business oligarchy, which contributes to global income inequality. It can have a snowball effect if left not checked––the global cyclical economic and financial crises as the most disastrous outcome. The world has to be equipped with new technology and especially new models of social, economic, and political governance to renovate itself to avoid the next systematic self-destruction.

As a scholar specialized in economics, Chen Ping further proposes consumer-investor economic theory: consumer spending creates investment value. According to him, consumer spending directly transforms consumers to investors by creating investment value through consumption. The theory effectively balances the consumer interests, investor interests, and enterprise interests. Through the investment returns earned from consumption, consumers have more influences and enjoy more benefits. Thus, the innovative economic model changes the status-quo distribution mechanism and propels transformation of the current economic model of capitalism toward an era of sustainable development.

Based on Chen Ping's innovative economic theory to reform the status-quo economic principle on consumption and investment, TideBit, owned by TIDEiSun, one of the world's safest cryptocurrency exchange platform supporting and the only crypto exchange in the world that supports transactions with fiat currencies of HKD, USD, EUR, and Turkish lira, utilizes the technology advantages of BOLT and has issued TBT, the world's first consumer proprietary tokens.

In 2019, TIDEiSun Group ranks as one of the world's top ten most influential FinTech enterprises by APAC CIOOutlook, a renounced FinTech media platform based in Silicon Valley.


## Early life

Born in Shanghai, China in 1955, Chen Ping grew up in a family where his parents came from a prominent background in the modern Chinese history since the late 19th century. "Both of his parents were idealists, committed to the change they knew the world needed to be better, fairer, more equal. His mother joined the then-progressive Communist Party during her time as a student, seeking a way to empower a common people who had dearly suffered during China’s turbulent history. Meanwhile, his father spent his time making significant strides for the army in military science. The two of them took their vision of a bright future into their own hands. From the time of his youth, his parents’ values of fairness and equality permeated Chen Ping's upbringing. Yet, with the ever-changing political climate, Chen Ping's father found himself branded a traitor. The government banned him from returning to China and to his wife and young son, and Chen Ping would not see his father again for over thirty years. However, it was just before leaving for the USSR that he gifted a young Chen Ping with the full extent of his book collection, passing on a love of knowledge and learning that would stay with Chen Ping for the rest of his days. 'Reading allowed Chen Ping to cultivate his mind and realize his ideological and cultural heritage,' says his biography on the website of his TIDEiSun company, one of the most prominent blockchain companies in East Asia, 'Chen Ping's consistent pursuit of freedom, equality, democracy, and justice in the past fifty years has stemmed from the lessons he learned during this time."

Chen Ping graduated from Anhui Mechanical and Electrical Engineering College in 1973. Chen Ping worked as a technician and senior researcher for a transformer factory in Wuhu, Anhui, and for the Shanghai Machinery Manufacturing Technology Research Institute, the Shanghai Science Institute, the Shanghai Science and Technology, Economic, Social and Strategic Studies Center, and the CITIC International Institute.


## Ideologist


### *The Age of Plunder*

*The Age of Plunder* recorded Chen Ping’s public comments during 2008 – 2011. It is about the 2008 Economics Crisis, its pathogeny, its long-term reverberations and its implications for China’s future. The author indicates this great crisis hasn’t fully subsided and it’s an irredeemable crisis of the “one-legged capitalist” social apparatus.

The author predicted and called for a new civilization (following the industrialized civilization) to overcome the prolonged, painful era of decline. A new emancipation movement is needed to break through the vested interests and mainstream values, to foster new cultures, new ways of living and to build a more fair and equitable democratic society with sustainable economic growth.

In China's perspective, the author proposed that China's party-controlled development model in the past 20 years is in a historical turning point. China has to rebuild a new republic and democratic state with new system, culture and value to achieve sustainable development.

In 2008, as the world financial crisis devastated the economy and on the eve of a larger socioeconomic crisis, Chen Ping keenly observed and pointed out that the 2008 crash was not the same as previous capitalist cyclical economic crises. Rather, it was the crash of a global development model that plunged its corresponding values and social systems into a deep dilemma. In other words, since the crisis of the US subprime mortgage system, the growth model of the globalized modern industrial civilization has come to an end.

“A mature capitalist society based on universal values should not only acknowledge that people are born equal, but also grant them equal access to information in their social lives,” he said in *The Age of Plunder*, a book chronicling his comments during the 2008 economic crisis. It was in his pursuit of this equality and fairness that he discovered something revolutionary. In 2001, he began to invest in the blockchain. The blockchain is a system with no one person in charge, but rather a system with collective, equal responsibility. No information can be tampered with, with an option for privacy. Its values of equality and fairness resonated with Ping: this was the system he had been looking for.


### iSun Media Group

Midnight and Debate were two talk-show programs hosted by Chen Ping in 2013. Commenting on topics varying from philosophy, history to current events, he put together more than 300 well-known guests to have open discussion and free debate including He Weifang, Zhang Yihe, Lu Yaogang, Li Rui, Zhang Sizhi, Zi Zhongxun, etc. On this electrifying television platform where minds meet and diverse, top Chinese public intellectuals and scholars gave independent viewpoints about the most controversial social, political and historical issues. The Chinese public intellectuals who were blacklisted by the government could finally talk freely about politics and everything in Midnight and Debate on SunTV.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### *Isun Affairs Weekly Magazine*

Soon after launched in 2011, *iSun Affairs Weekly Magazine*, the first multi-media online magazine of video, audio, and printing content in Hong Kong, immediately became a beacon of hope, freedom, and intellectual independence. It was a four-time prize winner of the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA). In 2013, it was banned in mainland China and later suspended the publication for restructure.

## Attack in Hong Kong

On about 3 June 2013 at 6 pm, Chen Ping in Chai Wan One, at the new Owen Center on Yip Street, was ambushed by two men, about 30 years old, according to police reports. Both men were armed with sticks. They struck Chen on the head. He was subsequently sent to Eastern Hospital. On June 5, Chen held a press conference about the incident, stating that the two assailants did not say anything, so he couldn't discern an accent, nor could he discern a motive, but was still suffering from tinnitus as a result. Police also quoted Chen Ping, and said the assailants planned an escape route to deliberately evade security cameras. Later, Chen Ping received a letter issued by the legal department of the *Oriental Daily* requesting the deletion of the online version of the report, but Sun TV refused to retract their findings.

The incident was revealed by the 2015 Annual Report of the U.S.-CHINA Economic and Security Commission and the 2015 Report on Hong Kong Press Freedom.
