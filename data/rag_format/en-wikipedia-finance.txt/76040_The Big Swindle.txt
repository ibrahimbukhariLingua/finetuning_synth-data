# The Big Swindle



***The Big Swindle*** is a 2004 South Korean heist film written and directed by Choi Dong-hoon. It was Choi's feature film directorial debut.

## Plot

Choi Chang-hyeok is driving in his car, when he suddenly finds himself followed by the cops. In the following chase he tries to escape, but as his car emerges from a tunnel it goes over the side, down a cliff and is killed in the burning wreck. The reason he tried to escape, is that he had just left the Bank of Korea, where he was part of a scam, that got him and his four accomplices the neat sum of US$5 billion won. One of his accomplices was caught, and the other three disappeared â€“ and so did all the money.

Eol-mae was the one caught by the cops, and they try to get him to talk and reveal the scam and his accomplices. In flashbacks we see how the plan was hatched, and get to know the suspects. The cops tries to find out more about the killed Chang-hyeok, and find his brother, who is the owner of a used book store. He has been at odds with his deceased brother, but now gets a big life insurance. This interests Seo In-kyeong. She has been living with Mr. Kim, who is a veteran con artist and the mastermind in the scam. In-kyeong learns about Chang-hyeok and now wants to get to know about his brother.
