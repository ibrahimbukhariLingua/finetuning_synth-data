## History

The company was founded by Nicolás Caputo, Roberto Gustavo Vázquez and Mauricio Macri in 1983. Roberto Gustavo Vázquez, hailing from Ford, already had experience in the automotive industry.

The company began by producing car air-conditioning systems in the city of Río Grande in Argentina. Its first product on the market was the Peugeot 504 air conditioner, which Mirgor designed and developed for Sevel. At that time, only 5% of cars in Argentina came with air conditioning.

Macri sold his shares in the company in 1994 and left the board in 1996.

In 1994, Mirgor began to list its shares on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.

After the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression, a restructuring of the company took place. Among other innovations, it started manufacturing home air conditioners and ventured into the still novel cellular phone industry.
