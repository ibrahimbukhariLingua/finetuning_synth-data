## History

Irish Continental Group was formed (as Irish Continental Line) as an Irish/Scandinavian joint venture in 1972 in order to provide a direct ferry link from Ireland to Continental Europe.

In 1988 Irish Continental Group was floated on the Irish Stock Exchange, followed in 1993 by a listing on the London Stock Exchange.

In 1992, ICG acquired the B&I Line, then owned by the Irish Government. This broadened the Group's activities to include the short sea links with the United Kingdom, Ireland's largest trading partner, and also extended the Group's operations into container transport and port operations.
