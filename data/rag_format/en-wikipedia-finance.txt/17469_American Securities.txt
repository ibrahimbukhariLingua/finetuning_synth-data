## History

By 2012 they had invested in "39 companies in a wide variety of industries, including industrial manufacturing, specialty chemicals, aerospace and defense, energy, business services, healthcare, media, restaurants, and consumer products."

In June 2009, American Securities Capital Partners officially changed its name to American Securities LLC.

## Controversies

American Securities owns Global Tel\*Link Corporation (GTL) which in 2015 had a 50% share in the $1.2 billion prison inmate telecommunications services including the controversial Inmate Calling Service (ICS). With prisoners in 2012 paying up to $17 for a 15-minute call, the Federal Communications Commission scrutinized the industry. In 2015 GTL sought judicial review of the FCC's regulation order aimed at lowering the cost of ICS.
