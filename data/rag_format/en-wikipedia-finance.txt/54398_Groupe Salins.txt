## History

The group was created in 1856 in Aigues-Mortes by a group of salt pan owners, which became the company Renouard et (Alfred Renouard), before becoming a joint-stock company, the Compagnie des Salins du Midi, in 1868. The headquarters were then located in Montpellier. Adolphe d'Eichthal became its presidentʷʰᵉⁿ?. In 1890, salt production exceeded 80,000 tons. The saltpans of Giraud were founded around the same period by the company Péchiney.

In 1960, the group acquired the *Société salinière de l'Ouest*, the main distributor of salts from the western region, thus controlling two-thirds of the market for Guérande salts. In 1968, it merged with the *Société Salinière de l'Est et du Sud-Ouest* and the saltworks in Dax (Landes), giving rise to the Compagnie de Salins du Midi et des Salines de l'Est (CSME), a national-scale group.

In 2004, French investment funds Abénex, Chequers Capital, and a fund managed by Crédit Agricole (Union d'Études et Investissements) entered the capital.

In 2012, French investment funds Abénex and Chequers Capital, mandated the investment bank Lazard to of the salt group. They halted the process a few months later due to a lack of comprehensive offers.

In 2014, Hubert François became the majority shareholder through his family holding company Finachef, with the remaining capital held by another individual shareholder. The amount of the transaction was not disclosed.
