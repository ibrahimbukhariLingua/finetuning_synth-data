In 2016, she became president & CEO of the Mori Trust, with her father Akira Mori assuming the role of chairman.

Since she took over the role of CEO, Date has pursued a strategy of globalization as part of the Mori Trust's mid to long-term vision, called Advance 2027, in order to reduce the trust's dependency on the Japanese real-estate market, which accounts for more than 90% of the business. Recent real estate acquisitions in Boston, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., US, are a reflection of this strategy.
