Fidelis Education


# Fidelis Education



**Fidelis Education** is a San Francisco-based tech startup company. The company's goal is to launch a new category of educational technology called Learning Relationship Management (LRM). Founded by a former US Marine and a Harvard Business School graduate, Gunnar Counselman, Fidelis Education focuses on helping universities scale and manage relationships between students, coaches, faculty, and mentors.

Fidelis belongs to a loosely defined software and services industry that encompasses a diverse array of companies, offering a range of services to various types of non-profit post-secondary institutions.


## Technology

The company is developing cloud-based software platform that allows users to manage personal and professional goals from matriculation, through graduation, and continuing into their careers. The platform allows each student to connect with a professional coach and a team of mentors who provide advice and encouragement through the entire process. The company currently partners with Arizona State Online, American Public University, and Stanford University.


## Funding

Fidelis is funded entirely through venture capital. The first round of funding raised $2.5 million from Accel and Novak Biddle, a firm that specializes in education startups.
