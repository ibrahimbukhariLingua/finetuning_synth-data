Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!


# Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!



***Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!*** is a 2009 work of fiction by American political activist Ralph Nader, described by him as a practical utopia, in the style of Edward Bellamy's 1888 utopian novel *Looking Backwards*.

Nader wrote the book to inspire imaginative solutions to the problem of corrupt politicians and financial institutions.


## Similarity to *Atlas Shrugged*

Just as *Atlas Shrugged,* by conservative author Ayn Rand, portrayed self-interested successful capitalists working to create a "Utopia of Greed" that is free from government, *Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!* portrays an altruistic group of super-rich individuals working to "re-make government" and where "the rebellious rich take on the reigning rich."

The novel's protagonist is inspired by Warren Buffett. On August 14, 2011, Warren Buffett wrote an influential op-ed entitled, "Stop Coddling the Super-rich", which argues that the super-rich should bear more responsibility and pay their "fair share" of taxes.
