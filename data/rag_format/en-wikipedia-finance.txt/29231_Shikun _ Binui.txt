**Shikun & Binui** (Hebrew: שיכון ובינוי, *lit.* "Housing and Construction"; TASE: SKBN) is a global business group based in Israel which operates through subsidiaries in businesses such as infrastructure, real estate, energy and concessions. Shikun & Binui's subsidiaries operate in more than twenty countries.


## History

Shikun & Binui was established in 1924, during the Mandate for Palestine. It was owned by Solel Boneh the construction arm of the Jewish trade union Histadrut.

In 1924, Solel Boneh (which later became part of Shikun & Binui) was established by the General Organization of Workers in Israel (the Histadrut) with the aim of uniting the different groups of workers who paved and built infrastructure throughout Israel, resulting in the creation of the largest labor contractor in the country. In 1958, in line with Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir vision, Solel Boneh expanded its operations into African countries, such as Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and others.

In 1996, the Histadrut's share in the company was sold to the company's employees and to Arison Investments (owned by the late Ted Arison, now owned by his daughter Shari Arison) as part of a large-scale privatization of the Histadrut's assets.

In 2007, the Shikun & Binui Group adopted sustainability as part of its corporate policy, a step that led to changes in the Group's structure, the daily conduct of its employees and increased involvement in projects that match the values of sustainability and ESG, such as renewables, water desalination and waste treatment.

In 2013, the Shikun & Binui Group won the Green Globe Award, which is given by “Life & Environment”, the umbrella organization of the green organizations in Israel, for a green business initiative.

In June 2018, Arison Investments sold its stake in the company (47%) to Netanel H. Saidoff, for NIS 1.1 billion. At this time, Tamir Cohen was appointed as the group's Chairman and CEO.

The Group's companies are involved in large-scale projects in Israel and around the world, in the fields of real-estate development and building contracting. The Group's experience and expertise, includes the planning, design, engineering, financing, permitting, construction, operation and maintenance of real-estate assets, as well as various infrastructure projects in the fields of power, renewables, transportation, water and wastewater treatment, environment and social infrastructure.

In 2012 the Ministry of Finance (Norway) announced that the Government Pension Fund of Norway would no longer invest in Shikun & Binui due to the company's breach of international law in East Jerusalem.
