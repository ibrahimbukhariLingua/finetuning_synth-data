Rochester Savings Bank


# Rochester Savings Bank



**Rochester Savings Bank** is a historic bank building located at Rochester in Monroe County, New York. It is a four-story, V-shaped structure, sheathed in Kato stone from Minnesota. It was designed by McKim, Mead and White and built in 1927 to house the Rochester Savings Bank. The building's banking room interior features murals painted by noted artist Ezra Winter.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

In 2011, the building was acquired by a group called Rochester Historic Ventures, which then set out to seek occupants that would allow the building to return to public use.

In October 2012, Rochester Institute of Technology announced the creation of a Center for Urban Entrepreneurship, to be housed in the Rochester Savings Bank building. The university planned to spend $3â€“5 million on renovations, eventually resulting in a multidisciplinary center and multiuse venue for RIT students. In 2016, after the lengthy renovation of the building, the Center for Urban Entrepreneurship opened.
