Semiconductor industry in South Korea


# Semiconductor industry in South Korea



In South Korea, the semiconductor industry has continued to grow since the 1980s due to the heavy use of semiconductors in computers and other devices. South Korea held a 17.7 percent share in the global semiconductor market in 2022, and continued to be the second largest in the world for the 10th consecutive year since 2013.

The country accounted for **60.5%** of the global memory semiconductor market, with a DRAM market share of **70.5%** and a NAND market share of **52.6%**. South Korea is continuously focusing on R&D and investment to maintain its competitive advantage. In addition, South Korea is pushing to expand its foundry market share based on ultra-fine processing technology. The country accounts for 17.3% of the global foundry market.


## History

The history of Korea's semiconductor industry began in 1965.

* In **1983:** South Korea became the third country in the world to develop 64K DRAM after the U.S. and Japan.
* In **1992:** South Korea rose to the top of the DRAM market.
* In **2013:** South Korea commercialized the world's first 3D V-NAND flash memory.

## Major companies

* DB HiTek
* DI Corporation
* Hana Micron
* Samsung Electronics
* SK Hynix
* Telechips

## Semiconductor cluster

The South Korean government announced in January 2024 its plan to invest about $470 billion over the next 23 years to build the world's largest semiconductor cluster in a large production complex to be built in Gyeonggi Province, along with SK Hynix. South Korea aims to increase the self-sufficiency ratio of essential materials, parts, and equipment for chip production to 50 percent by 2030.

> "If we complete the construction of the semiconductor mega cluster at an earlier date, we will achieve the world's leading competitiveness in the chip sector and provide quality jobs for young generations."

> — Ahn Duk-geun, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy

> "We already possess world-class technological and production capabilities in several areas, such as memory chips and OLED displays. The government must firmly support the private sector's investment for further growth."
> 
> — Yoon Suk Yeol, President of South Korea

Gumi is also the city which accommodate Semiconductor Clusters with Samsung Electronics and small and middle sized enterprises. SK Siltron also invest their factories and R&D centres in Gumi.


## Output

In March 2024, the Statistics Korea released statistical data related to semiconductor production in February of the same year. Compared to the same month last year, production increased 65.3%, the largest increase since the end of 2009.
