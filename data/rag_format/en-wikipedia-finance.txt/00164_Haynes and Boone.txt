## History

Haynes Boone was founded in 1970 by just two partners: Michael Booneand his Southern Methodist University professor Richard Haynes. Today it provides a full spectrum of legal services across multiple sectors, including energy, financial services, private equity and technology.

The firm began handling initial public offerings (IPOs) in the booming Dallas economy. To promote the firm and grow business outside of Dallas, Haynes Boone sponsored a series on the local public television station in 1984: “A Walk Through the 20th Century” hosted by Bill Moyers.

That same year, the firm opened a second office in Fort Worth followed by a third office in Austin two years later. Its San Antonio office opened in 1987, growing the firm to 166 lawyers. Haynes Boone expanded to Houston in 1990 to solidify its position as a Texas firm rather than just a Dallas firm.

The North American Free Trade Agreement was the impetus for the next expansion. In 1994, the firm opened its first two offices outside of Texas: a cross-border branch in Mexico City and an out of state branch in Washington, D.C. At that time, the firm had established seven offices and had over 300 lawyers, 30 of whom were international lawyers. The firm continued to grow coast to coast and internationally by adding offices in New York City in 2004, Orange County and Palo Alto in 2009, Shanghai in 2013, Chicago and Denver in 2015, London in 2016, the Woodlands in 2018, Charlotte in 2019, San Francisco in 2020 and Northern Virginia in 2023.
