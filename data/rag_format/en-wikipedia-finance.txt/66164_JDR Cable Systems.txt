## History

In 1971 Peter Jacques and G.H. Chaplin formed *Jacques Chaplin Engineering* based in Hertfordshire manufacturing industrial hoses. In 1981 the company relocated to Littleport, Cambridgeshire under the name *GH Chapling (Eng)*. In 1983 the company was acquired by Rotork, and renamed Jacques Rotork. In 1988 a management consortium bought the company and the business became known as Jacques Cable Systems.

In c.1991 Bromsgrove Industries acquired Jacques Cable and in 1994 acquired *De Regt Special Cables* - the two businesses were merged under Bromsgrove and renamed *Jacques De Regt Cable Systems*, later ***JDR Cable Systems***. In 1988 overall ownership was acquired by NatWest Equity Partners. In 2007 the business was acquired jointly by Vision Capital, Goldman Sachs and management.

After the 2007 acquisition the company established a factory at the Port of Hartlepool at a cost of c. £30 million, enabling easy transhipment of undersea cables direct to ship.

In 2011 the company's Dutch subsidiaries, its marine cable division, *JDR Cable Systems Holdings Netherlands BV*, and *JDR Cable Systems BV* (nr. Rotterdame) were sold to Fugro NV, and renamed *De Regt Marine Cables*.

By 2015 the Hartlepool facility had expanded to include 280,000 square feet (26,000 m²) of warehousing and employed 180 persons, driven by orders from the offshore oil and gas and wind industries. In early 2016 the business began constructing an additional 80,000 square feet (7,400 m²) factory at Hartlepool.

In 2021, the firm announced that it would open a new factory near Blyth with both private and state funding.
