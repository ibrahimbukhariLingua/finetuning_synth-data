## Controversies

In August 2007 Globus Medical settled a lawsuit initially filed by Synthes in 2004 over alleged stolen trade secrets. Former Synthes employees, who then worked for Globus, were accused of stealing 2300 electronic files containing blueprints for Synthes' products, safety-testing plans, and verbatim 510(k) filing documents. Globus paid Synthes $13.5 million and did not admit any wrongdoing.

In 2011, Synthes filed a second lawsuit against Globus Medical for infringing three patents, "asking the court to force the defendant to destroy its allegedly infringing products." Orthopedic Design & Technology Magazine reports that, "There was no finding of willful infringement in this lawsuit." A $16 million monetary damage was paid by Globus Medical in 2013.
