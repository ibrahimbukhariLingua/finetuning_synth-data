## History

The company was founded as Raia Drogasil in 2011 from the merger of drugstore companies Droga Raia (founded in 1905) and Drogasil (founded in 1935), both listed in the São Paulo Stock Exchange.

In 2015 the company was included into the Ibovespa, the main Brazilian stock Index.

In 2017 the company changed its corporate brand from Raia Drogasil to simply RD. It later adjusted the brand to RD Saúde in 2024 as the company shifted its strategy from being simply a pharmaceutical retailer into an integral health provider.

This strategy seeks to leverage the reach and proximity of its 3 thousand locations to its more than 47.5 million active customers as well as its 15.5% market share to promote a healthier society through 4 pillars: Health promotion (to promote, educate and maintain a healthy lifestyle), Prevention (to monitor and treat chronic conditions), Protection (to protect health through vaccination and immunization) and Primary Care (to diagnose and treat acute, low-complexity conditions).
