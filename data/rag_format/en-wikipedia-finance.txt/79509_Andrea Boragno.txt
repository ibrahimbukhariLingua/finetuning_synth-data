## Focus on art world

Noted for connecting the brand Alcantara to the art world, around 10 years ago Boragno foresaw a great potential in such a relationship and launched a series of collaborations and projects with both established top artists and creative avant-gardes and especially with museum institutions at an international level.

The collaborations with the art world involved more than 15 museums (including MAXXI, Victoria and Albert Museum, Yuz Museum Shanghai, Mori Art Museum, Palazzo Reale ), more than 10 cities (among others Rome, London, Shanghai, Tokyo, Milan) and around 100 artists (to mention but a few: Nendo, Marcel Wanders, Ross Lovegrove, Giulio Cappellini, Nanda Vigo, Yuri Ancarani, Qin Feng, Qu Lei Lei, Chiharu Shiota, Iris Van Herpen), for a total of more than 100 artworks exhibited.

Boragno’s important role in the development and growth of Alcantara’s relationship with the art world in recent years was the basis for the book “ALCANTARA The Material of Art”, published by Skira and edited by Luca Masia. The book tells the story of the birth and development of this special relationship, highlighting the many collaborations and projects Alcantara has undertaken with internationally renowned artists and designers.

Over the years, the dialogue with creativity brought to the definition of a new form of cultural collaboration between industry and the art world. In fact the relationship purely based on patronage or fundraising objectives has been replaced by a cultural partnership relationship with international museums and institutions, where Alcantara material has become integral part of the creative process.
