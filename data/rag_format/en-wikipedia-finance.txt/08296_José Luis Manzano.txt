During the COVID-19 pandemic, Manzano opposed protectionism, warning it could harm the global economy. He advocated for increased international trade during a panel at the International Economic Forum of the Americas.

Manzano also expressed support for government intervention and support of small and medium-sized businesses, but also called on businesses to adapt. "Those who are not prepared to adapt properly to this new reality will not be able to survive," he said (translated from Spanish).


### Mining and energy expansion (2023–2024)

In recent years, Manzano expanded his investments in Argentina’s mining and energy sectors. In 2024, he acquired lithium-rich acreage in northern Argentina and Brazil’s lithium valley, in order to mine for elements critical for the global clean energy transition. Additionally, he revived a potash-fertilizer project in Mendoza, aiming to boost agricultural exports and domestic production.

Manzano also expanded his presence in the Peruvian mining sector by acquiring Volcan Cia Minera SAA from Glencore Plc, which expanded Integra Capital’s presence in South America’s resource markets. Discussing his investment philosophy, he stated, “We believe we are positioning ourselves in things that will be necessary for the next 50 to 100 years.”


### Integra Capital

Manzano owns Integra Capital, an investment firm focused on energy and mining. It has funded major projects, including oil exploration in the Golfo San Jorge Basin, Patagonia. Pipelines, electricity generation, and industrial- and personal-use water projects are also within the company's scope of investments. In the power sector, Integra put together a large investment program of nearly $100 million dedicated to modernization and creation of an intelligent grid.

In 2024, Manzano expanded his business interests into the mining sector through Integra. He acquired lithium-rich acreage in northern Argentina and Brazil’s lithium valley, investing in minerals expected to be important for the global transition to clean energy. He also revived a previously-abandoned potash-fertilizer project in Mendoza, part of an effort to focus on resources projected to be in demand for the next 50 to 100 years.

Integra Capital also acquired Peruvian miner Volcan Cia Minera SAA from Glencore Plc, further increasing Manzano’s presence in the sector.


### Media

Resettling in Argentina in 1996, Manzano and entrepreneur Daniel Vila created UNO Medios, also known as Grupo Uno (Group One) or Group Vila-Manzano. They also established Supercanal Holding AS, now valued at more than $800 million.

Grupo Uno, in partnership with businessman Francisco de Narváez, acquired Buenos Aires TV channel América 2. Manzano and Vila expanded Grupo Uno into Argentina’s second-largest media group, controlling key channels in the Cuyo region by the late 1990s.

Today Grupo Uno consists of 40 media outlets throughout the country, including press, radio, television, and digital enterprises. Among the major channels is América 2, located in Buenos Aires, whose operation license was renewed during President Néstor Kirchner's administration. Through all of its media outlets, Grupo Uno reaches around 25 million people in Argentina. In addition, it is also a service supplier of Triple Play (a provider of telephone, Internet and cable television services) through the company Supercanal. Some 450,000 people in 14 Argentinian provinces subscribe to its services.

The Vila-Manzano group also bought into cable operations abroad. In 1977 it acquired 25% of Procono in Spain, and in 1997 formed Supercanal Cable Spain. The group also purchased VVC, Alvarez & Alvarez, Video Selimn, MEG, Electro Audio and Imagem Teresopolis, CATV Sat LITD, and Televisao Spectrum Systems, all in Brazil. In addition, the group owns cable operations in Bolivia and owns Dominican Supercanal in the Dominican Republic. The group owns or has owned part of the magazine *Primera Fila*, the newspapers *La Capital de Rosario* and *New Time, Paraná*, and various radio stations.

Grupo Uno has 28 licenses between AM, FM and open television broadcasting. Manzano and Vila control channel América and its cable TV channel América24, La Red radio and newspaper networks including La Capital del Rosario and Diario UNO in Entre Rios, Mendoza and Santa Fe. With its extensive network of media services, the company reaches about 25 million people in Argentina and thus constitutes the second largest multimedia group in the country.

As one of the key owners of Grupo Uno, Manzano led the partnership with China Watch, a media outlet of news and analysis about China's business, society and culture. China Watch became the first Spanish-spoken media about China.


#### Holdings

As of 2001, the Vila-Manzano group, through Supercanal Holding SA and other firms, controlled dozens of cable-TV enterprises across Argentina.

The group also owns or has owned the magazine Primera Fila, in Mendoza; the daily newspapers La Capital and El Ciudadano, Rosario; el periódico Nueva Hora de Paraná; Canal 7 in Mendoza, Canal 8, Radio AM Calingasta and Radio FM Nuestra, in San Juan; Megavisión SA (Siempre Mujer) and Radio Rivadavia, among others.


### Energy and oil

Manzano and Vila are also leaders in the electricity sector through Edemsa, a private-public company that provides electricity to Mendoza province. The two men created Andes Energía, a Latin American energy group dedicated to the exploration, development and production of conventional and non-conventional oil and gas. The company operates in Argentina with 24 licenses. In Colombia, it currently has 11 licenses for oil investments. The company is listed on the stock exchanges in London and Buenos Aires, and is part of an operating holding company with subsidiaries including Kilwer, Ketsal, Grecoil and Interoil.

In July 2017, Andes Energía merged with Petrolera El Trebol (PETSA), an Argentine subsidiary of Switzerland's Mercuria. The merger created the new company Phoenix Global Resources and it has a strong presence in the country's most prolific conventional and non-conventional oil basins. Its main objective is the development of the Vaca Muerta field in both Neuquén and Mendoza.

Manzano and Vila secured a $60 million deal with Mercuria, a major hydrocarbon trader. This included a $20 million debt settlement for drilling in Chachaheun and a $40 million credit line for Vaca Muerta and other projects.

In addition, Manzano has investments in the oil sector through the firm Ketsal/Kilwer. Within the last few years, the business has been awarded exploitation contracts in southern Argentina, an area of great oil extraction potential.

Manzano and Vila also control Hidroeléctrica Ameghino S.A. (an electricity generating plant) in Chubut Province. The plant is connected to the Patagonic Electric System and provides an annual 174 Gwh of electricity.

In 2013, Vila and Manzano bought 49.9% of the UTE (Transitory Union of Companies) led by El Trebol to exploit the Chañares Herrados and Puesto Pozo Cercado deposits in Tupungato (concessioned until 2017). The operation was carried out with Mercuria, the holding company owner of El Trébol. They signed an agreement with a Brazilian oil company named Imetame Energia to explore their fields in Brazil.


### Building

Manzano also works with Vila in the construction industry through their industrial construction company Pamar SA, which specializes in building gas pipelines and has more than 35 years of experience in the market. Pamar works in Latin American countries creating oil and gas pipelines, process plants, electricity distribution networks, fiber optic networks and sanitation works. Pamar S.A. was recognized as the leader of the "Central West Gas Pipeline System", the largest of its kind in Argentina, covering more than 500 kilometers. Its biggest customers are YPF, TGS, TGN and EDEMSA.

The Vila-Manzano group became part of Metrogas, after British Gas (BG) agreed to sell its holdings to the company Integra Gas Distribution LLC, owned by the Mendoza holding company. Integra is the second largest shareholder (17% of total shares) of the company after YPF.

Metrogas distributes more than 19% of the total gas supplied in the country and is the only gas distribution service provider in and around Buenos Aires. It covers more than 2,150 square kilometers and has 15,800 kilometers of pipeline. It has more than 2.3 million customers.


### Wine production

In 1998, Manzano entered the wine industry. He created Grupo Vitivinícola de Tupungato, which operates Los Algarrobos estate in San Juan, and vineyards and a winery in Tupungato, Mendoza.

The winery spans 1,533 hectares at 1,200–1,500 meters above sea level, with 30 hectares of vineyards. It produces 1 million liters of wine annually for domestic and international markets.

In the same building as the winery is a restaurant known as La Tupiña in Gualtallary, owned by the Viticulture Group of Tupungato.


## Political activities

Manzano has expressed optimism about the country's economy under President Javier Milei, particularly the administration’s approach to inflation control and market liberalization. He said he believed the government’s policies were starting to stabilize the economy, predicting that Argentina could enter a period of growth at the end of 2024.As a major shareholder in Grupo América, Manzano has long held influence in Argentina’s media landscape. In 2025, América is expected to maintain a favorable stance toward President Milei’s government, marking a strategic shift in its editorial direction.

Earlier in his career, Manzano was active in Argentine politics. He served as Secretary General of the Peronist and was an elected member the National Congress. Manzano quickly rose through the ranks to become the majority leader from 1983 to 1991. President Carlos Menem appointed Manzano to his cabinet, where he served as Homeland Security Minister. On August 12, 1991, he was appointed the Ministry of the Interior.

He was known as a power broker who other members had to go through to get anything done. He is credited with helping pass economic reforms (the opening of the economy) and government reforms during the Menem administration.

Manzano was a key figure in 'La Renovación Peronista,' helping to reorganize the party after its electoral defeat. He has been called "a symbol of the late-80s renewal of Peronism."

During his political career, Manzano was first vice president, and then president, of the Deputies Block of the Justicialist Party (PJ).

In 1983 he was the Argentine national deputy. As a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the nation, he participated in the approval of the legislative bill on the modification of the civil marriage regime, being one of the main speakers of the discussion sessions prior to the final sanction of Law 23,515 (Divorce Law) in 1987.


### "Responsible liberty"

During his time in politics, Manzano spoke out in support of personal responsibility and individual liberties, which he called "responsible liberty."

He defended the practice of people marrying after separation, and this defense coupled with his support of individual liberty was documented in a speech he gave on August 19, 1986, where he affirmed his belief in the importance of responsible liberty:

> "We want adult liberty, responsible freedom for the Argentines, and that those who want to re-bet on love and family, instead of having the comfortable situation of separation without assuming responsibilities, to assume together with Argentine society these two issues, that we do not understand separated because in the justicialismo we learned to live them together: freedom and responsibility (...) When we speak of liberation, we are referring to the fact that as a nation and as a people each of us has to opt for more things every day, that every day he must make the renunciation that he must make to his individual freedom in order to build together collective freedom.
> He also referred to the importance of consensus for the country. "When they say that it is not possible, we will say that it can. And that day, when we finish learning the lesson that the motor is the consensus, what better is to close the ears to the lobbyists and open them to the clearest voices of Argentine society – those who come from the people, the only legitimate source – we can together rediscover many things (...) And then we can rediscover together that dreaming is not crazy and that dreams are possible."

In 1991, as Minister of the Interior and leader of the federal security forces, he played a key role in investigating the abduction of the businessman Mauricio Macri.

In 2008 Manzano was honored in Argentina's parliament (the National Congress of Argentina) along with other former members for helping to reconstruct Argentina's returning democracy.


### United States

From 1993 to 1995 Manzano lived in California where he began to develop his career in the private sector acting as an international consultant. He lived in Washington, D.C., in 1994 where he joined the Republican Party. In 1995, he studied English and American domestic policy at the University of San Diego, and created a consulting firm called Integra Investments S.A., where he serves as the company's president. Integra Investments has offices in Washington, Miami, Buenos Aires and Mendoza. In late 1995, after spending two years away from Argentina, he returned home with plans of pursuing a business career.
