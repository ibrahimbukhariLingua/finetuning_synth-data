## Aircraft leasing in Ireland

As of 2013, Ireland had established itself as a prominent jurisdiction for aircraft finance and leasing, according to law firm Dillon Eustace. The origins of the Irish industry can be traced back to the establishment of Guinness Peat Aviation in Shannon, County Clare, in 1975. A survey conducted by the Federation of Aerospace Enterprises in Ireland estimated that aviation leasing companies in Ireland managed assets valued at approximately €82.9 billion in 2013.

The financing of aircraft requires a substantial amount of capital, with an estimated annual need exceeding US$100 billion to cover all aircraft deliveries. Aircraft leasing has gained prominence and now accounts for about 40% of the global aircraft financing market. This growth is attributed to airlines recognizing the advantages of leasing, which offers greater flexibility in managing their aircraft fleets. Some lessors anticipated that the proportion of leased aircraft in the global fleet would increase to as much as 50% in the years following 2012.
