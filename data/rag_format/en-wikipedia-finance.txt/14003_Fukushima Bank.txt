## History

Established in 1922 as Yumoto Shinkin Mujin Co., Ltd. (湯本信用無尽株式会社), the bank was originally located in the Yumoto neighborhood of Iwaki City, on the South-Eastern coast of Fukushima Prefecture. In November 1932, the bank absorbed Fukushima Mujin Co., Ltd.(福島無尽株式会社), renamed to Fukushima Mujin Bank Co., Ltd.(株式会社福島無 金庫), and moved the main office to Kamimachi, in Fukushima City. The company changed names again, to Fukushima Mutual Bank Ltd.(株式会社福島相互銀行) following the enforcement of the 1951 Mutual Bank Act (相互銀行法). The main office relocated to a then new building in Honmachi, Fukushima City, in January 1955.

The company began online banking in April 1976. A second online system was launched ten years later, in 1986, followed by a third in 1991.

Also in 1986, the company began facilitating foreign currency exchanges.
