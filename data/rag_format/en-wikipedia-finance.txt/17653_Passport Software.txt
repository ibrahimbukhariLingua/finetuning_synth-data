Microsoft purchased Great Plains one year later.

### Litigation

Passport was a long-time licensed dealer of RealWorld through its purchase by Great Plains software and beyond. In 1989, Passport licensed its PBS derivative of RealWorld for five years to Do It Best Corporation, known as DIB. In October and November of 2000, after unsuccessful negotiations to renew and expand the license, DIB started negotiating a license from Great Plains, the new owner of RealWorld, and worked with Passport to remove Passport's updates to RealWorld. Passport discovered that DIB had long been using a purchase order program that it claimed to have developed on its own, but which had been mostly copied from an unlicensed Passport purchase order software modules, and showing a DIB copyright. Around this time, Passport copyright notices in DIB's software were replaced with a DIB division name's copyright notice.

In May 2001, Great Plains decided to terminate Passport's license to RealWorld, which at that time was set to run through 2010. DIB sued Passport preemptively to prevent Passport form interfering with its use of the software, and Passport countersued for copyright infringement for the purchase order system, and for instigating Great Plains to terminate the RealWorld license to Passport.
