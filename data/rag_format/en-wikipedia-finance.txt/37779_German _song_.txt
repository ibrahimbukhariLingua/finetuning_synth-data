# German (song)



"**German**" is the debut single by Australian hip hop group No Money Enterprise, released on 1 November 2019.

## Critical reception

Tommy Faith of Triple J Unearthed said of the song: "These boys have a serious future ahead of them if they can keep dropping heaters like "German". The beat puts them in a different lane to plenty of the blossoming drill artists coming through right now and itâ€™s the perfect oil slick for them to flow over."


## Commercial performance
