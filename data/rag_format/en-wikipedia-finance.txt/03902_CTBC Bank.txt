## Philippine subsidiary

Chinatrust Philippines Commercial Bank Corp. is a subsidiary of Chinatrust Commercial Bank Corp. of Taiwan. It is listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange, but the majority of shares are held by Chinatrust Taiwan. In November 2000, Chinatrust Taiwan agreed to purchase 63,526,127 shares of Chinatrust Philippines at P19 per share from a group of shareholders led by then-President William Go, increasing its shareholding from 57.5% to 91%. However, there was some uncertainty surrounding this transaction, as with a public float of less than 10% of shares outstanding, Chinatrust Philippines would have to be delisted. In the end, Chinatrust Philippines was able to remain listed by declaring its intention to issue more shares through a secondary market offering, and paying fines to the exchange in the meantime. However, in 2012, CCB has been delisted from the Philippine Stock Exchange.

Chinatrust Philippines' president is currently Steve Tsai. Its 23 branches give it one of the most extensive branch networks among foreign-owned banks in the Philippines.
