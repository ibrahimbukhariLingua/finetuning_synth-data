**Alinta Energy** is an Australian electricity generating and gas retailing private company owned by Hong Kong–based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises (CTFE). The sale for $4 billion was approved by Treasurer Scott Morrison in 2017. Alinta Energy has an owned and contracted generation portfolio of up to 1,957 MW, approximately 1.1 million combined electricity and gas retail customers and around 800 employees across Australia and New Zealand.

In March 2011, due to a deleveraging transaction by the TPG Group, Alinta became Alinta Energy. Alinta Energy was acquired by Hong Kong–based Chow Tai Fook Enterprises in 2017. Chow Tai Fook Enterprises also acquired Loy Yang B power station with assists from Alinta Energy staff.

In May 2018, Alinta Energy was announced as the principal partner of the Australian Men's cricket team on a four-year deal, the longest in Australian Cricket history. The Alinta Energy logo will feature on the players' kits for all international matches played in Australia.
