Taobao village


# Taobao village



**Taobao villages** (simplified Chinese: 淘宝村; traditional Chinese: 淘寶村; pinyin: *Táobǎo cūn*) are rural Chinese villages where the local economy has developed to focus extensively on e-commerce via the Taobao online retail platform. Taobao villages have contributed to economic development and rural revitalization in China.


## Definition

Taobao villages are rural Chinese villages where the local economy has developed to focus extensively on e-commerce via the Taobao platform.¹¹² Alibaba's research division defines Taobao villages as those in which (1) businesses are located in an administrative village in a rural area, (2) the village's annual e-commerce revenues exceed RMB 10 million, and (3) the village has either an excess of 100 active online shops or active online shops account for more than 10% of village households.¹¹²


## Overview

Taobao villages are concentrated in China's coastal regions, particularly in Zhejiang province (which is where Alibaba, which operated the Taobao platform, is located).¹¹² Zhijiang City in Hubei province also has a significant cluster of Taobao villages.²⁷⁹ As of at least 2023, Taobao villages are increasingly developed in inland parts of China.¹¹²

Taobao villages first began appearing in 2009.²⁷⁸ By 2013, twenty Taobao villages existed in China.¹¹² In 2020, 5,425 such villages existed, generating total annual revenue of RMB 1,000 billion via 29,600 active online shops.¹¹²


## Impact

The geographical clustering of e-commerce businesses in Taobao villages have mutual benefits for these businesses, as opposed to when they operate in greater isolation.¹⁸⁰ Geographic clustering of e-commerce businesses facilitates knowledge exchange and allows for increased labor market pooling.¹⁸⁰–¹⁸¹ Increased economic activities also can attract government-subsidized capital.¹⁸⁵

Because Taobao villages have increased the incomes or rural people and entrepreneurship in rural China, Taobao villages have become a component of rural revitalization strategies.²⁷⁸

The spontaneous development of Taobao Villages inspired the Rural Taobao program, a rural e-commerce project undertaken by the Chinese government and Alibaba.¹²⁹–¹³⁰ This program aimed to provide rural households with the same level of access to consumer goods that urban residents have and to facilitate the sale of agricultural goods through e-commerce.¹²⁹ As of 2017, the program covered 16,500 villages.¹³⁰
