## History

Zywave was founded in 1995 by individuals at a regional insurance brokerage, Frank F. Haack & Associates, (later part of Willis) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who developed the products as customer service tools. They shared the software with other brokers in industry networking groups like Assurex Global and Intersure. The company then completely separated from Frank F. Haack in 2004. In 2008, Zywave entered into a strategic investment partnership with Vista Equity Partners, a San Francisco private equity firm. In 2010, Zywave announced the acquisition of Specific Software Solutions, a provider of workers' compensation software, and in 2011, Zywave acquired financial planning software developer Emerging Information Systems, Inc.

The name "Zywave" was inspired by the axes and shape of a data graph.
