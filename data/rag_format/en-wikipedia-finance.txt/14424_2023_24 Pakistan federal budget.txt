## Reception from the IMF and Bailout


### IMF Dissatisfaction

The 2023-24 Federal Budget would be introduced during times of Polycrisis Crisis in Pakistan. On June 8, Esther Perez Ruiz, the IMF's permanent resident in Pakistan would state that Pakistan would need a convincing budget for any chance of bailout. However, following the initial budget proposals of Ishaq Dar on June 9, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed its dissatisfaction calling them a missed opportunity to broaden the tax base while criticizing the new tax amnesty scheme that "creates a damaging precedent". The IMF would state that the tax amnesty provisions of the budget went against the bailout programme conditionality. On June 25 a revised Budget featuring new taxes, a raised the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL), a lifting of all restrictions on imports and various expenditure cuts were presented to the National Assembly and accepted the next day. These came after talks between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. Ishaq Dar claimed that the new budget would "make our fiscal deficit much better", adding "I hope, God willing, that we will have an agreement with the IMF." Seeing the raising in Rs. 215 billion in taxes projections and cutting of Rs. 85 billion in spending per IMF demand.


### Release of Funds

Five days after the Federal Budget was first presented to the National Assembly, the IMF would approve its $3 Billion bailout for Pakistan on 30 June. Analysts said that the deal averted the threat of default hanging over the country. This following politically risky measures taken by the Sharif government including raising taxes, reversing subsidies in power and export sectors, increasing energy and fuel prices, agreeing to a market-based currency exchange rate, cutting spending and revising the 2023-24 Federal Budget. Micheal Kugelman writing "Islamabad waited until the very final hour to take the (politically risky) fiscal policy steps that the IMF had been hoping to see for months. If it had taken those steps earlier, much of the drama and fraught negotiations of recent months likely wouldn't have had to play out." The $3 billion in funding would be higher than originally anticipated, with an upfront of $1.1 billion to be disbursed, with the rest in nine-month instalments. The IMF noted that the FY24 budget was "in line with the goals of supporting fiscal sustainability and mobilising revenue, which will enable greater social and development spending." Supporting initiatives to broaden the tax base, increase tax collection from undertaxed sectors, and ensure fiscal space to strengthen fiscal support for the BISP. "It will be important that the budget is executed as planned, and the authorities resist pressures for unbudgeted spending or tax exemptions in the period ahead," the IMF stated.

Journalist Mehtab Haider stated that the budget numbers "unrealistic", especially non-tax revenues. Economist Ali Farid Khwaja however instead held "so far, it looks like an honest budget rather than a populist or unreal budget which the previous ones [have been]." Dr Asma Hyder supported the budgets freelancer and IT export programs, "The budget speech by the finance minister reflects that the economy is probably intended to move towards more liberalization with reduced taxation, import duties, and easy loans for productive activities — which is not bad.
