**Sir Rodney Malcolm Aldridge** (born 7 November 1947) is the founder and former executive chairman of Capita, a British company specialising in business process outsourcing.

## Professional activities

Aldridge founded and led the Capita Group from its formation in 1984 until 2006. During this time the group expanded to become a FTSE 100 company. The group was founded in 1987 when Aldridge led the management buyout (MBO) of the group from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA).

In 2006 Aldridge resigned as Executive Chairman of Capita after it was revealed that he had lent the Labour Party £1 million. The loan, which was secret at the time it was made, was controversial, in part, because Capita is a major public sector supplier. Aldridge retired from his position as Chairman of Capita in July 2006.

Prior to Capita, Aldridge worked in local government for 10 years with East Sussex County Council, Brighton Borough Council, Crawley Borough Council and West Sussex County Council. He joined CIPFA in 1974, becoming its Technical Director. At the launch announcement of Ada, the National College for Digital Skills, he was also listed as Chair.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
