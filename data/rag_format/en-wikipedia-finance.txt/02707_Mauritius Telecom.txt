## History

Mauritius Telecom was founded in July 1992 by a merger between the former Overseas Telecommunications Services Ltd and Mauritius Telecommunication Services Ltd. As from that date, Mauritius Telecom became the major provider of voice, mobile, Internet and data communication services in Mauritius.

In 1996, Cellplus Mobile Communications Ltd, a Mobile Network Operator and a fully owned subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom launched the GSM network in Mauritius and later during the same year Telecom Plus Ltd, another fully owned subsidiary of Mauritius Telecom as from 2006, launched a dial-up Internet access service.

In November 2000, France Telecom (now Orange S.A.) became the majority shareholder of Mauritius Telecom by acquiring 40% of its shares. Following the partnership with France Telecom, Telecom Plus Ltd launched Broadband Internet Access in 2002 under the Wanadoo brand.

The two companies launched in June 2006 their IPTV services branded as My.T which enabled Mauritius to become among the first countries in the world to launch IPTV services.

On 17 April 2008, Mauritius Telecom re-branded its mobile and internet services as Orange. Cellplus Prepaid and Post Paid were rebranded as Orange Prepay and Post Pay. Telecom Plus dial-up internet access and Wanadoo ADSL as Orange Dial-Up and Orange ADSL.

In 2013, Mauritius Telecom introduced fibre optic broadband. In May 2015, Mauritius Telecom announced that as from 1 June 2015, all its 850,000 Orange mobile customers would receive free unlimited access to Facebook.

After a 10-year branding agreement with Orange came to an end in September 2017. All Mauritius Telecom products were re-branded under the My.T brand on 9 November 2017.
