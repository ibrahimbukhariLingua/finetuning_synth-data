## London Stock Exchange

Furse listed the 200-year-old exchange on its own market in 2001, which prompted a record five unsolicited or hostile bids in under two and half years from late 2004 to early 2007.
A major technology upgrade to TradElect, in 2007, proved to be disastrous causing multiple severe outage, only 2 year after its 'debut', months after Clara Furse's tenure ended, Microsoft's TradElect was discarded for a cheaper and 10+ time faster Linux based solution, still in use more than a decade later, by 2009 LSE market share. <https://web.archive.org/web/20131019184937/http://www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/reports/21\_22/-24395-1.html>
The exchange conducted a number of successful bid defences before completing its merger with Borsa Italiana in October 2007, which provided the foundation for a diversification into derivatives, fixed income, clearing and settlement.


## Fortis

Furse was a non-executive Director of Fortis when the Belgian bank, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander, purchased ABN Amro in 2008. The acquisition led to the bailout of Fortis which was subsequently sold off in parts to the Belgian and Dutch states and BNP Paribas.
