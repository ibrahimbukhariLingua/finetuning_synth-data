## History

Impressed by its initial performance, Muhammad Ali Jinnah asked the Habib Bank to move its operations to Karachi after the independence of Pakistan.

After the privatisation scheme was announced in 1991 by the Pakistani Government, Habib Group was the first to be granted permission to start a private bank, the Bank AL Habib Limited.

Under the privatisation policy of the Government of Pakistan, the Dawood Habib Group was granted permission to set up a commercial bank. Bank AL Habib was incorporated as a Public Limited Company in October 1991 and started banking operations in 1992. (Late) Hamid D.

Habib, who was the managing director of Habib Bank Limited from 1953 until its nationalisation, was appointed as the managing director and chief executive of Bank AL Habib Limited until he died in 1994.
