List of US states by minimum wage


# List of US states by minimum wage



This is a list of the official minimum wage rates of the 50 US states and the federal district of Washington, D.C. For comparisons to other countries see: List of countries by minimum wage.

See minimum wage in the United States for much more info, including detailed state-by-state and **city-by-city** breakdown of the facts and numbers, and more info on US territories. Some of the sources list many more exceptions to the main rate in each state (both lower or higher than the statewide rate). The main source for the info is the U.S. Department of Labor.

## Notes by state

This section breaks it down further by state. These are the main exceptions to the main rates in some states. There are many more exceptions in the sources.


## Consolidated minimum wage table

Below is a compact table of the minimum wages by U.S. state, U.S. territory, and the District of Columbia. This table is an exact duplicate of the Department of Labor source page ("Consolidated Minimum Wage Table"). So it may be out of date at times. See date on table at source. The federal minimum wage applies in states with no state minimum wage or a minimum wage lower than the federal rate (column titled "No state MW or state MW is lower than $7.25."). Some of the state rates below are higher than the rate on the main table above. That is because the main table does not use the rate for cities or regions. See the main U.S. Department of Labor source for details.


**Notes:**

* See state and territory abbreviations list.
* Go to source for more details by state (such as the superscript numbers).
