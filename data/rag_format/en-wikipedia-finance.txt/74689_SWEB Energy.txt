In 1990, SWEB Energy was formed from the privatisation of the South Western Electricity Board.

In 1995, SWEB Energy was bought by the American utility Southern Company.

Western Power itself (officially known as WPD South West) dealt with the local distribution, metering and substations, and the 'SWEB' brand name was continued as a retail energy utility.

In June 1999, SWEB was sold to French-owned EDF Energy. The acquisition was authorised by the European Commission in Jul.1999. EDF discontinued the 'SWEB' brand name on 5 June 2006.
