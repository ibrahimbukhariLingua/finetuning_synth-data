## Career

At the age of 17, Hussain started working as a waiter at the Indian Ocean restaurant in Gabalfa. Around 1991, at the age of 18, when the local prawn supplier went out of business, having seen a gap in the market, Hussain took £20 worth of fuel and the money to buy six cases of prawns – and sold them on. He started his business while working evenings as a part-time as a waiter in the restaurant and studying at college for his A Levels at Coleg Glan Hafren. He saw an opportunity in the market for prawn supply and started off by selling a few boxes of frozen prawns with his friend, delivering them at night while continuing with his education during the day.
