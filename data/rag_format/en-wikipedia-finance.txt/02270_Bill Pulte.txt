## Biography

The grandson of housing businessman William J. Pulte, Bill grew up in Florida and attended Northwestern University, where he majored in broadcast journalism and graduated in 2010. At Northwestern, he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and served as its president.

After graduating from college, he spent some time working for the private equity fund Roger Penske's Penske Capital Partners and founded Pulte Capital Partners LLC in 2011, an equity firm that mainly worked on housing products. By 2014, the firm had $30 million in revenues and 200 employees; that year, Pulte was named to the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in the category of manufacturing and industry. He has stated that his business made much of its money by "buying air-conditioning companies, growing them and then selling them," and, as of 2021, to have a net worth of close to $100 million. He also founded, with his grandfather, the Detroit Blight Authority, which worked on several projects to clean up the city of Detroit.

Pulte is also a philanthropist, documenting his actions on Twitter and calling himself the "inventor of Twitter philanthropy". By September 2019, he had given over $100,000 to various causes, which the *Detroit Free Press* noted included "stunts such as handing cash to strangers in parking lots, giving away free cars or announcing that he would give $30,000 to a military veteran if President Donald Trump gave him a retweet." President Trump did give him a retweet, posting afterwards "THANK YOU BILL." Later that year, he raised his giving to over $1 million. He had amassed over 3.2 million followers on Twitter by 2021.

Pulte gave significant donations to the Republican Party during the 2024 election year, including to Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. After Trump won the presidential election, he announced on January 16, 2025, that he was nominating Pulte to serve as the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

As of August 2019, Pulte had married.
