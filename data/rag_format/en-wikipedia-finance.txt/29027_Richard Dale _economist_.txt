## Biography

Educated at Marlborough College, Dale graduated from the London School of Economics in 1965. He subsequently qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn and was later awarded a PhD in Law and Economics by the University of Kent. In 1969 Dale became founder and editor of International Currency Review, a journal specialising in global financial markets which continued in publication (under new ownership from 1973) for the next forty years. After a brief spell as a journalist on the Financial Times, Dale worked for N.M. Rothschild (1973 to 1977), where he was appointed an Assistant Director of Rothschild Asset Management.

In 1979 Dale became lecturer in finance at the University of Bath. He held a Rockefeller Foundation International Relations Fellowship in 1981/83 and was affiliated with the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, where he was a consultant to the Group of Thirty and testified before Congressional committees on the Latin American debt crisis. In 1989 he was appointed Professor of International Banking at Southampton University, where he remained until his retirement in 2002.

In 1994 Dale was a senior Houblon-Norman Fellow at the Bank of England; from 1993 to 2002 he was a visiting professorial fellow at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London University; and from 1993 to 2009 he was a visiting professor at University of Reading. From 1999 to 2002 he was a member of the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee and a board member of the European Capital Markets Institute, representing European business schools.

Outside his academic work Dale was a consultant to the Banking Association of South Africa and to several City institutions, including N.M. Rothschild and the Corporation of London. He was an adviser to the UK Treasury and to the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee and an expert witness on behalf of the Irish Competition Authority. From 1990 to 2007 Dale was co-founder and co-editor (with Professor Steve Thomas) of two quarterly credit rating services: FT Credit Ratings International and FT Credit Ratings in Emerging Markets.


## Research

Dale has sole authored five books and over 40 journal articles on international finance and banking. His book "International Banking Deregulation – the Great Banking Experiment" (1992) predicted that the dismantling of barriers between commercial and investment banking could precipitate a 1929-style global financial meltdown while his
book "The First Crash: Lessons from the South Sea Bubble" (2004) used financial history to challenge the rational expectations assumptions of modern finance theory.

In his retirement, Dale has written two books and several journal articles on historical subjects ranging from the downfall of Sir Walter Raleigh to medieval pilgrimage. He
was elected a Fellow of The Royal Historical Society in 2014.
