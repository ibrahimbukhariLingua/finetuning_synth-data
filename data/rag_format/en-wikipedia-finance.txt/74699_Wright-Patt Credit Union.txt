## History

The organization that is now Wright-Patt Credit Union was founded in 1932. It was during the national economic depression of the early 1930s (the Great Depression) that federal employees at Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) recognized the need for an “every person” financial institution. Since that time, WPCU has become Ohio's largest member-owned credit union and one of the largest in the United States. Today, WPCU serves thousands of members from numerous employer and community groups and associations. WPCU has been known by the following names since its inception:

* In 1932 – F.E.U. Local 148 Credit Union
* In 1948 – Wright Field Credit Union
* In 1951 – Dayton Federal Employees Credit Union
* In 1962 – Wright-Patt Credit Union

## Organization

Wright-Patt Credit Union is a state-chartered credit union in Ohio, federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Like all credit unions, WPCU is governed by a board of volunteers, elected by and from its membership. WPCU also owns a separate subsidiary, myCUmortgage, LLC, which operates as a credit union service organization (CUSO). CUSOs were established by NCUA as a way for credit unions to offer products and services that would normally be outside of the credit union's scope.


## Services

Wright-Patt Credit Union offers a full selection of products and services typically found at most financial institutions, including savings accounts, checking accounts, consumer loans and certificates of deposit. Credit unions are financial cooperatives so their savings accounts are referred to and recorded as “shares” because they represent members’ ownership of the credit union. Anyone eligible for membership can become an owner of the credit union by opening an account and depositing $5.00 into a “share” savings account. Additionally, WPCU offers its members small business loans, auto loans, mortgage loans, student loans, credit cards, lines of credit, health savings accounts, IRA accounts, direct deposit (through ACH), telephone banking, online banking, mobile banking, and remote deposit as well as many other services.


## Member Center & ATM locations

As of February 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Wright-Patt Credit Union operates 34 member centers (commonly called branches) around the Greater Dayton area, Cincinnati and Columbus in Ohio. They also partner with other ATM providers giving members lower-to-no-fee access to any Alliance One, CO-OP Network, or STAR ATM. WPCU has also partnered with other credit unions in the United States through the Shared Service Center network (CU Service Centers), which allows WPCU members to conduct most of their financial business at other credit union locations as if they were at their own local WPCU member center.
