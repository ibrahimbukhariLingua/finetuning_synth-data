# Molina Healthcare



**Molina Healthcare, Inc.** is a managed care company headquartered in Long Beach, California, United States. The company provides health insurance to individuals through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.


## History

Molina Healthcare was founded in 1980 by C. David Molina, an emergency room physician in Long Beach, California. He had seen an influx of patients using the emergency room for common illnesses such as a sore throat or the flu because they were being turned away by doctors who would not accept Medi-Cal. Molina established his first primary care clinic with the goal of treating the lowest-income patients, regardless of their ability to pay.

In September 2020, Molina Healthcare entered into an arrangement to purchase approximately all the assets of the Affinity Health Plan for about $380 million.



## Leadership

For twenty years, the company was run by Dr. Molina's son, J. Mario Molina, MD, a physician. He was the president and CEO of the company. John Molina, Mario's younger brother, was the CFO of Molina Healthcare. The two took over Molina's operations after their father died in 1996 and continued to expand the company. In May 2017 J. Mario and John were removed from their positions by the Board of Directors, who cited poor financial performance as the reason for the change in leadership. In October 2017 the company announced Joseph Zubretsky, the former CFO of Aetna, as Molina Healthcare's president and CEO.


## Clinics

The first Molina Medical clinic was opened in Wilmington, California in 1980. The company formerly operated clinics in Washington, New Mexico, Florida and Utah. The clinics were opened to provide health care to low-income families and individuals. In August 2017 Molina Healthcare announced it would close several clinics in Michigan, Florida, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Utah.


## Becoming HMO

Molina Healthcare has focused on government-paid healthcare programs such as SCHIP and Medicaid since it became a health maintenance organization in 1985. From 1985 to 1997, the company was based solely in California.
