## About Pharmascience Inc.'s Founders and CEOs


### Dr. Morris Goodman

Morris Goodman, born in 1931 in Montreal to Ukrainian parents, is a figure of Canadian entrepreneurship and a pioneer of the generic drug industry.

Morris Goodman studied pharmacy at University of Montreal, in the same class as Jean Coutu. He completed his studies in 1953, at the age of 21. While he was still in university, he founded his first pharmaceutical distribution company with a friend: Winley-Morris.

After graduating, Dr. Goodman became interested in the industrial side of pharmacy. Soon after, several international companies granted him distribution rights to market their products in the Canadian market, which he marketed under the name Winley-Morris Co. Ltée. In 1953, he was offered to distribute a treatment for tuberculosis.

In 1971, he approached the California-based International Chemical & Nuclear Corporation (ICN) and became the Canadian distributor of L-dopa. Impressed by his innovative approach, ICN purchased Winley-Morris and offered Morris Goodman the presidency of ICN Canada. Goodman spent a total of 12 years working at ICN Canada.

In 1983, at the age of 52, Dr. Goodman founded Pharmascience Inc. with his friend and colleague Ted Wise. Serving as both the co-founder and chairman of the board, he is behind the significant growth of the company, which is today one of the three largest generic pharmaceutical companies in Canada and the largest pharmaceutical employer in Quebec today.

Dr. Goodman has always been a philanthropist, in addition to being a pharmacist and businessman. Through the Morris & Rosalind Goodman Foundation, the foundation created by Dr. Goodman and his wife Rosalind in 2005, he financed, among other projects, The Stroke Unit at the Jewish General Hospital of Montreal, the Agora at the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Montreal, and The Rosalind & Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre at McGill University, as well as, more recently, the CHU Sainte-Justine's Goodman Pediatric Formulations Centre.

In 2015, Morris Goodman published his book “To Make a Difference,” an autobiography that includes testimonials about his colleagues and collaborators.


### Ted Wise

Ted S. Wise, who passed away in 2013, was a pharmacist. He co-founded Pharmascience Inc. in 1983 and also served as chairman and vice chairman of the board of directors.

Dr. Goodman obtained his bachelor's degree in commerce from McGill University, and his Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of Virginia. Upon graduation, he began his career at Pharmascience in Business Development, before taking charge of the future of the company, both in Canada and internationally.
