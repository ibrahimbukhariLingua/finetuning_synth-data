50 Most Influential (Bloomberg ranking)


# 50 Most Influential (Bloomberg ranking)



The **50 Most Influential ranking** has been published by Bloomberg Media since 2011, annually featuring 50 individuals or initiatives with "the ability to move markets or shape ideas and policies".

Initially published in Bloomberg Markets until the 2016 edition. *Bloomberg Businessweek* took over from 2017 onwards.

According to Bloomberg Media, the list is composed on the basis of recommendations and assessments by Bloomberg's journalists and analysts in the United States and internationally as well as data from Bloomberg Terminal.

The ranking has repeatedly been used as a reference or even as a news topic by news media other than Bloomberg, particularly in 2015 when political leaders were included.
