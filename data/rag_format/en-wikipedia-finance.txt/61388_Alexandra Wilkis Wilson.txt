She then entered the Louis Vuitton management training program, which included working the sales floor. Subsequently, she worked for two years managing retail operations for Bulgari.

Wilkis Wilson co-founded the Gilt Groupe in 2007, a flashsale company that offers luxury goods for sale at significant discounts, but only for brief windows of time. In 2012, Wilkis Wilson and cofounder Alexis Maybank, a classmate from Harvard Business School, published a book on Gilt's founding, *By Invitation Only: How We Built Gilt and Changed the Way Millions Shop.* At one point the company was valued at a billion dollars, making it a "unicorn" (a venture capital slang term for a startup valued at a billion dollars), but sold to Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson's Bay Company for $250 million in 2016. Wilkis Wilson left the company in 2014.

In September 2014, she became co-founder and CEO of GlamSquad, a mobile styling company "which offers on-demand beauty services through an integrated app." Clients can use an app to book hair and makeup artists for house calls--"the Uber of beauty services." The company had $8 million in sales in the first year, and raised $24 million in funding, as of February 2017. It operates in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington, DC.

In March 2017, Wilkis Wilson launched a startup called Fitz, a service that offers an in-person wardrobe consultation and then follow-up advice on shopping. Fitz was sold to Tradesy, the online peer-to-peer resale marketplace for women's luxury and designer contemporary fashion, in February 2018. In February 2018, Wilkis Wilson was recruited by Boston Consulting Group to join Allergan as the SVP, Consumer Strategy & Innovation. She led new efforts in revolutionizing digital marketing and DTC initiatives for Allergan's leading aesthetics portfolio including Botox, Juvederm and Coolsculpting. She left Allergan in July 2020 after the company was acquired by AbbVie Inc. for $63B.
