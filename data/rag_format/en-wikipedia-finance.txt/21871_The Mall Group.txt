## History

The Mall Group opened its first retail store on 25 June 1981 on Ratchadamri Road in Bangkok. At the time it had 400 employees.

In 2020, the group decided to rebrand for the first time in 39 years, aiming to turn all shopping and retail entertainment complexes to "The Mall Lifestores". According to Chairwoman Supaluck Umpujh, all existing malls should be rebranded by 2023.

In December 2021, the company announced it was teaming up with Bitkub, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Thailand, to form a joint venture aiming to make Thailand a leading hub for digital asset investment.

The company is 65% owned by the Umpujh family and 35% owned by the Phataraprasit family.
