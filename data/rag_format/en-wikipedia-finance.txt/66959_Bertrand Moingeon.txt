He has an accreditation to supervise research in management science (1993) and is a graduate of the International Teachers Program (1992).


## Interests

For the past 25 years he has been trying to grasp the explanatory factors underlying the functioning of organizations. This was already the rationale behind his Ph.D. in Sociology on Pierre Bourdieu’s contribution to understanding organizational management. Beyond the mere formulation of descriptive theories, he is particularly interested in coming up with ‘actionable’ schemes. In the tradition of publications such as Chris Argyris, with whom he collaborated at Harvard, his research shows that a powerful lever for change is ‘when managers are aware of their own share of responsibility in situations which they happen to lament’. Such a call for awareness appears in his many publications on the management of change, strategic management, corporate identity and organizational learning. He has also carried out numerous consulting and training missions on these same themes both in France and abroad.

Professor Moingeon co-authored *Strategor*, the leading strategic management textbook in France (translated into 4 languages). He has also published several books including *Organizational Learning and Competitive Advantage* (with Amy Edmondson, Professor at the Harvard Business School, Sage, 1996) and *Corporate and Organizational Identities* (with Guillaume Soenen, Routledge, 2002). Finally, he has published articles in reviews and periodicals such as *Management Learning*, *Long Range Planning*, *European Management Journal* and the *European Journal of Marketing*.
