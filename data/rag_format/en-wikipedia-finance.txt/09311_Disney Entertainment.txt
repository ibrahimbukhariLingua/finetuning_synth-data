Disney Entertainment


# Disney Entertainment



**Disney Entertainment** is one of the three major divisions of the Walt Disney Company created on February 8, 2023. It consists of the company's entertainment media and content businesses, including its motion picture film studios, television divisions and streaming services.


## Background and history

On November 20, 2022, the Walt Disney Company announced the dismissal of then-CEO Bob Chapek and the return of his formerly-retired predecessor Bob Iger. The following day, Iger announced that Kareem Daniel would step down as chairman of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED), which would be later reorganized into a new unit with Alan Bergman, Dana Walden, James Pitaro and Christine McCarthy being involved in its creation. Iger reasoned that the move was intended to return "more decision-making back in the hands of our creative teams and rationalizes costs".

On February 8, 2023, Disney announced a corporate restructuring that included the establishment of Disney Entertainment, with Bergman and Walden serving as chairman and co-chairman respectively. Operations of Disney Streaming, Disney Platform Distribution and all divisions of the Walt Disney Studios and Disney General Entertainment Content, as well as overseas operations were consolidated into the new segment.

On February 9, Rebecca Campbell, chairman of international content and operations, announced that she would step down from her position. Later that month, Walden reorganized the units of Disney General Entertainment Content, placing National Geographic and Onyx Collective under the oversight of FX Networks chairman John Landgraf and combines Freeform and ABC Entertainment.
