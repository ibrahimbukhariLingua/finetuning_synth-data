Spark Capital


# Spark Capital



**Spark Capital** is a venture capital firm in the United States which specializes in funding early-stage startups of consumer, commerce, FinTech, software, frontier, and media sectors. It has branches in San Francisco, Boston, and New York City.


## History

Spark Capital was launched in 2005 by Paul Conway, Santo Politi, and Todd Dagres.

They have raised six early-stage funds: US$265 million in 2005; $360 million in 2008; $360 million in 2010; $450 million in 2013; $400 million in 2016; $450 million in 2020.

They have also raised three growth funds: $375 million in 2014; $600 million in 2016; and $900 million in 2020.


## Team

Spark Capital was founded in 2005 by Bijan Sabet, Paul Conway, Santo Politi, and Todd Dagres. The company consists of approximately 11–50 employees.


## Investment approach

A *Forbes* article about Spark Capital variously attributes Spark Capital's success to focusing specifically on technology startups in the media, entertainment, and mobile sectors; to information-sharing within the company, which is organized so that all partners can work with a portfolio company (not just the partner assigned to that company); and to the partners themselves' use of the products of the companies they invested in (such as Twitter).

Spark Capital has been known for co-investing with Union Square Ventures. Many of Spark Capital's top picks, including Twitter, Tumblr, and Foursquare, were made via partner Bijan Sabet and were joint investments with Union Square Ventures, made by partner Fred Wilson. Other firms with which Spark frequently co-invests include SV Angel, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, and First Round Capital.

Sabet says that Spark Capital's portfolio companies do not use non-compete agreements, which he says have been a key factor in limiting startup growth in New York and Boston.

Bijan Sabet, the partner at Spark Capital, invested in Twitter's second (Series B) round in June 2008, along with Jeff Bezos and additional investments from past investors such as Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, and Sabet also accepted a board seat at Twitter. According to *Hatching Twitter*, Sabet and Wilson played a crucial role in facilitating smooth leadership changes at Twitter in October 2008 and later October 2010—ousting Jack Dorsey to install Evan Williams in 2008 and ousting Williams to install Dick Costolo in 2010.
