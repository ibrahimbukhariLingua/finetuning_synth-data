## Onshore Outsourcing

In October 2003 RTTS started an on-shore outsourced testing service that provides software quality and automated testing services using American programmers working out of offices in the US. The model differs from offshoring since engineers work in a similar time zone with no language barriers and no visa issues. It has been rebranded as Testing in the Cloud.


## Software

In 2008, RTTS spun off TOMOS Software, LLC. TOMOS is software as a service (SaaS) for Application lifecycle management. TOMOS is role-based, with roles defined for project manager, business analyst, developer and tester. TOMOS has modules for requirements management, test authoring, a test execution engine, defect tracking, version/build management, and collaboration.

In 2010, RTTS began work on an enterprise test tool for data testing. QuerySurge was released in early 2012. QuerySurge automates big data testing, data warehouse and ETL testing, data interface testing, data migration testing and database upgrade testing.
