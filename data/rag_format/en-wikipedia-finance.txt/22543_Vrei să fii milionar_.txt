# Vrei să fii milionar?



****Vrei să fii milionar?**** (lit. 'Do you want to be a millionaire?') is a Romanian game show based on the original British format of *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*. The show is hosted by Virgil Ianţu (2011–2012, 2014) and Teo Trandafir (2018–2019). The main goal of the game is to win 1 million Romanian lei by answering 15 multiple-choice questions correctly. There are four *lifelines* - 50/50, phone a friend, ask the audience and change the question (available only from the 11th question). *Vrei să fii milionar?* is shown on the Romanian TV station Kanal D (2011–2012, 2018–2019) and Prima TV (2014).
