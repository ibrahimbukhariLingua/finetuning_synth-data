## History

On 15 January 1900 (1900-01-15), the Dairy Farmers Co-operative Milk Co. Limited was created by 65 stakeholders, most being dairy farmers in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. The aim of the co-operative was to market their milk and butter products effectively to city customers. Dairy Farmers was 100% Australian owned by Australian dairy farmers for 107 years, and ultimately had 11 processing facilities. In 2005, Dairy Farmers had the third-highest dairy sales in Australia, with Norco Co-operative second and National Foods, under its brand "Pura", first.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2008, Dairy Farmers was acquired by Kirin Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd, part of the Kirin Group of Japan, and became a 'brand' of National Foods, which Kirin has bought the previous year, ending 108 years as a co-operative company. After Kirin Holdings acquired the alcoholic beverage company, Lion Nathan, in 2009, National Foods & Lion Nathan were merged to become "Lion Nathan National Foods". Lion Nathan National Foods became Lion and Lion Dairy & Drinks in 2011.

Dairy Farmers' head office was located in Homebush Bay, Sydney until 2008. Lion Dairy & Drinks has its head office is in Melbourne, but LD&D's parent, Lion, has its corporate head office in Sydney.

In November 2019, China's Mengniu Dairy announced the purchase of Dairy Farmers’ parent company Lion Dairy & Drinks from Kirin, for approximately A$600 million (US$407 million). ACCC gave clearance on 20 February 2020, but it still needed FIRB approval. On 25 August 2020, it was announced that Kirin and Mengniu had decided to cancel the sale because rising geopolitical tensions between Australia and China meant it was unlikely approval from Australian regulators would materialise.

On 23 November 2020, it was announced that Bega Cheese would purchase Lion Dairy & Drinks, and all subsidiaries including Dairy Farmers for a reported A$550 million. This would make Dairy Farmers Australian-owned for the first time since 2008.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
