# Kereta Cepat Indonesia China



**PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China** (lit. 'Indonesia China High-Speed Railways Limited', abbreviated as **KCIC**) is an Indonesian transportation company that operates the Indonesian high-speed rail network built on the Jakarta–Bandung route in the Parahyangan megapolitan area.

The company is a joint venture between PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN Indonesia (PSBI) by 60% and Chinese state-owned consortium company Beijing Yawan HSR Co. Ltd. by 40%. PSBI itself is a joint venture of Indonesian state-owned enterprises consists of Kereta Api Indonesia (51.37%), Wijaya Karya (39.12%), Jasa Marga (8.3%), and Perkebunan Nusantara VIII (1.21%). Beijing Yawan HSR Co. Ltd. is also a joint venture, formed by Chinese state-owned enterprises including China Railway Group Limited (42,88%), Sinohydro (30%), CRRC (12%), China Railway Signal & Communication (10.12%), and China Railway International (5%).


## History


### China's bid and the establishment of KCIC

In April 2015, the People's Republic of China competed with Japan when the two countries offered their high-speed trains to Indonesia. This competition, according to *The Jakarta Post*, is part of a geopolitical and economic rivalry between the two countries to gain strategic influence in the Asia-Pacific region. After the project was nearly canceled at the end of September, Indonesia chose China as the winner of this 75 trillion rupiah (US$5 billion) project.

On 2 October 2015, PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN Indonesia (PSBI) was formed as a consortium of four state-owned enterprises involved in the high-speed train development process namely: Kereta Api Indonesia, Wijaya Karya, PTPN VIII, and Jasa Marga. On 6 October, the formation of the consortium was reported to the Financial Services Authority, and President Joko Widodo passed Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 107 of 2015 concerning the Acceleration of Implementation of Fast Train Infrastructure and Facilities between Jakarta and Bandung. The company will invest in a joint venture.

The joint venture is called PT Kereta Api Indonesia China, with 60% ownership of PSBI and 40% of China Railway International Company Limited. The company was formed on 16 October 2015 and is planned to prioritise commercialisation, not burden the state budget, and promote synergies between businesses. Responding to this new partnership, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga stated he "deeply regretted" and "difficult to understand" Indonesia's choice. However, BUMN Minister Rini Soemarno said that China's financial structure was considered more profitable because China's proposal did not require guarantees and funding from the Indonesian government.


### Construction

To start construction, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) passed Presidential Regulation no. 3 of 2016 as a National Strategic Project. On 21 January 2016, Jokowi laid the first stone for construction in the Walini Tea Plantation area owned by PTPN VIII. The estimated financing for the construction process reaches IDR 70 trillion.

In 2017, in the City of Beijing, PRC, a Facility Agreement for Infrastructure Financing and Fast Train Facilities was signed, which was personally witnessed by President Jokowi and PRC President Xi Jinping. Budi Karya Sumadi as the Minister of Transportation reminded construction contractor companies to immediately speed up the construction process. According to him, land acquisition is a problem of hampering infrastructure development, and he does not require that land acquisition be completed 100%. Nevertheless, land acquisition is still a prerequisite that must be met so that the loan provided by the China Development Bank can be disbursed immediately.

The established route is the Jakarta-Bandung route of 142.3 km, and is supported by four stations namely Halim, Karawang, Walini and Tegalluar. Each station will be equipped with facilities to support transit-oriented development (TOD) around the station. Regarding the plan for this new station, Walini will be projected as a new planned city that will become a buffer for the Greater Bandung area. This project is projected to absorb 39,000 workers during the construction process, 20,000 workers during the TOD construction process, and 28,000 workers after operation. To support operations, KCIC will present 11 sets of fast trains with 8 railway carriage per trains.

This project does not always run smoothly. The estimated cost set by KCIC was originally around US$6.1 billion, but in November 2020, KCIC estimated that there would be an increase to US$8.6 billion, and management was able to reduce costs to US$8 billion. The BUMN (State-owned enterprise) Ministry said that this cost overrun would be covered with funding from a consortium of shareholders and loans. The consortium will bear the 25% cost overrun originating from the state's capital participation that goes into PT Kereta Api Indonesia in the amount of IDR 4 trillion and China will lose IDR 3 trillion. The remaining 75% comes from loans.

On 18 October 2021, KCIC stated that Walini Station, which was originally included in their list of stations, was removed from the list of stations, due to cost efficiency. Therefore, they will choose to shift the station to Padalarang for modal integration reasons.

On 18 May 2023, KCIC officially started the first trial of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail line. The KCIC line is electrified with a voltage of 27.5 kV AC.

On May 6 2016, the then KCIC President Director, Hanggoro Budi Wiryawan, determined the Jakarta-Bandung route for the KCIC line. According to him, the route has purchasing power which makes it very possible to buy high-speed train tickets. Bandung, according to Wiryawan, is a place with enough potential to be developed in the trade and tourism sector. With this determination of the route, KCIC's business is not only limited to relying on its high-speed rail, but also the development of areas around the stations where KCIC will serve.

This line is supported by 13 tunnels and was built using elevated construction with a length of 60% of the total track length (142.3 km). The rest use at grade, especially for the segments that will go through the tunnel until they finally arrive in Bandung.

The Jakarta–Bandung high-speed rail line (KCJB) has a track width of 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) and was initially powered by 25 kV AC overhead power. This line has been doubled since its construction for the first time. During the trial process on May 18, 2023, the electric voltage was changed to 27.5 kV AC. Four LAA traction substations are located in Halim, Karawang, Walini, and Tegalluar.

## Rolling stock fleet and service

In 2022, CRRC Qingdao Sifang, Co. Ltd. launched the electric multiple unit for KCIC. The train, which was based on the CR400AF/Fuxing design, was given the KCIC400AF series and could run up to 350 km/h. The base is adapted according to the climatic and geographical conditions of Java island and will present interior design with Indonesian nuances such as komodo dragon, batik and Borobudur. The series of high-speed trains are designed to be minimal in noise and vibration, resistant to fire, floods and earthquakes, as well as being resistant to attack by foreign objects. The train are named "***Komodo Merah***" (lit. 'red komodo dragon') or "***Petir Merah***" (lit. 'red lightning').

Apart from operating 11 high-speed train sets, KCIC also operates one inspection train. Fleet deliveries start in August 2022 and are scheduled to arrive in Indonesia at the end of August. According to Joni Martinus, KAI's VP Public Relations, the rate to be set is between IDR 250,000 and IDR 350,000. However, Martinus believes that the cost are still in estimating in various aspects.

The DF4B Diesel Electric Locomotive was also brought in to support this project. This locomotive belonged to China Railway, and was sent back to China on 19 September 2023.
