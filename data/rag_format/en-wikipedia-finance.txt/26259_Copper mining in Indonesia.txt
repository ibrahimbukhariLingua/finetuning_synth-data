Copper mining in Indonesia


# Copper mining in Indonesia



Indonesia is a major producer of copper, with the seventh-largest production in the world in 2023. Copper is one of Indonesia's main exports with smelting facilities being established in recent years. The largest copper mines in the country are the Grasberg mine in Central Papua and the Batu Hijau mine in Sumbawa, and the two mines contribute the vast majority of the national production. The mines have been accused of causing significant environmental impact through the dumping of tailings and of human rights violations against local communities.


## History

The oldest known copper artefacts in Indonesia were dated to between the 4th century BC and 1st century AD, in Harimau Cave in South Sumatra. Although later artefacts indicate local metallurgical processing, the raw copper was sourced from outside modern Indonesian through trade. Rich copper (and gold) deposits were discovered in 1936 by Jean Jacques Dozy at Puncak Jaya in modern Central Papua, and the Grasberg mine, the largest copper mine in the country owned by Freeport McMoran, began operations there in 1973. In 1990, further copper deposits were identified in Sumbawa, and the Batu Hijau (owned by Newmont) began production in 2000. In 2014, the Grasberg and Batu Hijau mines accounted for 97 percent of Indonesian copper output.

Since 2009, government policies requiring downstreaming has resulted in Newmont's divestment from the Batu Hijau mine while Freeport McMoran has invested in refineries. The first copper refinery was opened in 1996 in Gresik, East Java, for the smelting of ores from the Freeport Grasberg mine. Two more smelters, one in Gresik as Freeport's second smelter and another by Amman Mineral (Batu Hijau's new operator) in West Sumbawa, were inaugurated in September 2024. As of 2024, further mining projects are in development in Banyuwangi, East Java, in Gorontalo, and in Beutong, Aceh.
