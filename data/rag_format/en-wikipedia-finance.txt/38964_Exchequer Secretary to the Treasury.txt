Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury


# Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury



The **Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury** is a junior ministerial post in His Majesty's Treasury, ranked below the First Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Paymaster General and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and alongside the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. It ranks at Parliamentary Secretary level and the holder does not attend Cabinet.

The first Exchequer Secretary was Phillip Oppenheim, who held the post from 23 July 1996 to 2 May 1997, when he lost his seat in the general election that brought Tony Blair to power.

After a period of abeyance, the office was reinstated upon Gordon Brown's accession as Prime Minister in June 2007, when Angela Eagle was appointed Exchequer Secretary. The office again fell out of use in July 2016 when Theresa May became Prime Minister, before she reinstated it following the 2017 general election.

The position was held by Helen Whately, having been held by Kemi Badenoch from 2020 to 2021.

The minister is shadowed by the Shadow Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, who sits on the Official Opposition frontbench.
