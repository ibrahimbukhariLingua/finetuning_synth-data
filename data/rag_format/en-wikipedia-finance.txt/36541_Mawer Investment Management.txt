# Mawer Investment Management



**Mawer Investment Management** (Mawer) is a Canadian investment management firm headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. It acts as a subadvisor for Manulife Investment Management.


## History

In 1974, stockbroker Charles Mawer founded the company originally as Mawer & Associates. The firm focused on looking after money for high-net-worth individuals and pension funds in the form of investment funds.

In 1995, Charles Mawer retired from his role running the firm.

2005 Manulife Investment Management selected Mawer to manage its investment funds in a subadvisory capacity.

In November 2018, Mawer hired Bank of Nova Scotia to explore options such as a sale. This came at a time when other Canadian asset management firms were being acquired. However, in December, Mawer decided to remain independent.

The firm's philosophy is to buy strong, growing companies at cheap prices. It has been noted for charging low management fees compared to its peers. Due to lower commissions, financial advisers have avoided selling Mawer funds. The partnership between Mawer and Manulife have allowed more generous and less visible compensation structures for funds.
