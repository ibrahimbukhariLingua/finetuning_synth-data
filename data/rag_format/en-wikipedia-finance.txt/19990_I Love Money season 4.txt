I Love Money season 4


# I Love Money season 4



The fourth season of the VH1 reality television series *I Love Money*, created by *The Surreal Life* executive producers Cris Abrego and Mark Cronin and their company, 51 Minds Entertainment, premiered on 16 September 2010. The third season was originally slated to air in January 2010, but was pulled from the schedule in 2009 after one of the contestants, Ryan Jenkins, committed suicide after being charged with the murder of his wife, Jasmine Fiore. It subsequently emerged that Jenkins had been convicted of assault in 2007. However, due to an inadequate background check by Straightline International, the firm contracted to vet him, this was not disclosed to VH1 or 51 Minds. According to 51 Minds, had this assault been disclosed, Jenkins would have never been allowed on the show.

The fourth season's 18 contestants were drawn from *I Love New York*, *Rock of Love*, *Real Chance of Love*, *Daisy of Love*, *Megan Wants a Millionaire*, and *For the Love of Ray J* to compete in physical and mental challenges, aiming for a $250,000 grand prize. Production began in late August 2009 and wrapped September 2009. The show was reportedly edited in order to focus on the competitions, as VH1 noted they "had a new programming filter in place" in the wake of the Jenkins incident. This was to be the final season of the series. The winner of the competition was Mindy Hall.

When they get to the site of the challenge, they see two mannequins standing on a platform in the water wearing a giant bottom apparatus. Craig then tells them on the "of love" shows there is always one girl with a huge bum. He then goes on to say that the challenge is called "Junk in the Trunk"; it then shows a clip of Brittanya's big bum. What they have to do is go on the platform against someone else on the opposing team that is the same sex, wear the giant bum apparatus and fight each other only with apparatus the first person to fall off the platform loses and the winner gets a point for their team. After five rounds the team with the most points win the challenge. First up is Hot wings vs Mindy; Mindy is worried that because Hot wings has a huge butt she will probably win.

Marcia, Feisty, Corn Fed and Mindy at first say they're going to vote for 6 gauge and Francisco. 6 Gauge then gets furious and storms out. Marcia and Feisty leave the room thinking that their alliance with Corn Fed and Mindy are going to stick together and vote for the guys. 6 Gauge comes back in after and tells them that there is no way any of them are going to make it far into the game if they all keep putting the strongest people in the box and as they will not win any challenges if the weaker people just stick around in the team. This ends up persuading everyone to not vote for the guys, although Marcia and Feisty do not know any of this as they are not in the room and are not told of this. In the vault Feisty gets voted in the box and so does Corn Fed. This infuriates Marcia she ends up having a huge fight with Mindy saying that she is not loyal and a backstabbing liar who turned her back on their alliance and agreement whilst being naked. On the power outing Marcia and feisty have a huge argument with Corn Fed this causes Brooklyn to not even be able to speak or say anything. Finally Brooklyn has a one on one with Feisty and she talks about how Corn Fed is not loyal and talks about the alliance she had and how Mindy and Corn Fed went back on the alliance they had, She also says that she would be willing to throw the team challenges for him whilst their talking, Marcia breaks down in front of Corn Fed saying how betrayed she feels as she thought they were friends and she would go away from this experience even if she did not win feeling like she had mad some really good friends. After the power outing, Marcia says to Chi Chi that your father's laughing at you as Chi Chi's dad is dead, Which makes Chi Chi emotional and Brooklyn who over hears does get emotional as well as his dad is dead. At the elimination they all get their final pleas Feisty and Marcia basically state that their loyal unlike Corn Fed and will always have Brooklyn's back if he saves them. Corn Fed states that she was loyal to her team like Brooklyn is and she had to do what she had to do. Brooklyn then calls up Marcia saying that he had heard her saying some really personal things to Chi Chi about his deceased Father.

In the morning, Craig tells the contestants there are no more teams and that they will be competing as individuals from here on out, and then they are given different colour tops to wear. Blonde Baller has huge target on her back as the male alliance wants her out. Sassy tries to help out Blonde Baller to take the target off her back and get rid of Punisher. When they get to the challenge, Craigs tells them the challenge is called "Talk to the Hand" which is based on moments of the "of love" shows where as soon as there is an argument the hands always go up, there is clip that shows Junk having a fight with Blonde Baller and her hand going up. What they have to do is put on a giant glove which is strapped to a vat above full of what Craig calls "Nastiness." If they drop their hand, the vat tips on them. The person to hold their hand up the longest is paymaster, while the first person to drop their hand is automatically put in the box. Straight away with the challenge, Garth and Punisher keep tormenting Blonde Baller so that she will crack or get distracted so that her hand falls but all that does is distract Punisher so his hand drops and the vat falls on him, making him the dead last loser. He does not worry though, because he knows that his alliance has his back. However, Brooklyn and 6 gauge soon drop their arms which worries Punisher. Blonde Baller makes a comment about Garth's mother which offends him, as he says he is a mama's boy. This motivates Garth to keep his hand up longer to win the challenge and void Blonde Baller's check. Then Francisco drops his arm followed by Hot wings as she outs two arms which makes the vat drop. They then reach the 25-minute mark and six of them still have their hands up. Brittanya asks Punisher, "Why did you have drop your arm? Now I have to keep my arm up longer." The hour goes past and Corn Fed then drops her arm. Sassy then decides to give out which annoys Blonde Baller, as she needed Sassy or herself to win so she will be safe. Mindy then drops her arm, then Blonde Baller's arm drops, which excites Punisher. Garth then asks Brittanya to drop her arm so he can be paymaster but Brittanya says no and Garth's arm drops, so Brittanya wins the challenge and becomes paymaster.

Punisher is very happy with the outcome of the challenge because he knows he won't go home. Blonde Baller, knowing she has a target on her back, asks Brittanya if she has a problem with her and Brittanya says, "I'm sick of hearing you talking shit so maybe," but Brittanya is not 100% sure she will send Blonde Baller home. Later on, Brittanya tells Sassy that she really likes Francisco which excites Sassy because Sassy sees this as an opportunity to save Blonde Baller. Sassy tries to get Brittanya and Francisco close to each other which works. She then leaves them alone and tells Blonde Baller that she might be safe, and says that "Brittanya actually being a ho might save us." Francisco and Brittanya start hooking up. Whilst that is going on, Mindy and Corn Fed spy on them to see what's going on. Mindy gets very frustrated and angry as she likes Francisco and she thought he had feelings for her as well. Later on, Brittanya and Francisco go into the bathroom and presumably have sex. When Francisco comes back, Mindy is furious with him and tells him how she feels. In the morning when Punisher hears of this, he gets really pissed off as he thought Brittanya liked him. Punisher then gets angry at Brittanya which makes her angry and she considers eliminating him. In the Vault, everyone votes for Blonde Baller to go in the box except for Sassy and Hot Wings as they're in an alliance with Blonde Baller. Sassy gets four votes but only from the guys (except for Francisco). No one else is voted for. On the power outing, Blonde Baller and Punisher are worried and both plead their cases. Blonde Baller says that if Brittanya saves her, she will have her alliance's back. Brittanya is unmoved and unconvinced by Blonde Baller's plea. Punisher states that he and Brittanya have an alliance and he is sorry for what happened before. At elimination, Brittanya announces that she slept with Francisco, which shocks the cast and humiliates Mindy. Sassy believes that it will be down to her best friend in the house (Blonde Baller) and her worst enemy in the house (Punisher). Brittanya calls up Blonde Baller and says "I'm sick of my hearing my name in your bitch face, so Craig, void that check."

Craig then tells them that the challenge is called the "pole dance" (this challenge was also used on the first season of i love money). The person that hangs up on the pole the longest is the paymaster whilst the first person to fall off the pole like in season 1 is automatically eliminated.
Everyone gets off to a good start on the pole Corn Fed feels that this is a good opportunity to get rid of a guy. About a minute into it Francisco tries to climb up the pole which stuffs up his position and starts to make him slide more down to the bottom of the pole. Garth realises that he put his leg in the wrong position and starts to slide down the pole and eventually he falls off making him the dead last loser and automatically eliminated. Francisco then falls off knowing his safe not long after. Punisher feels extremely sad about Garth getting eliminated and ends up losing focus and slides off the pole. 6 Gauge's arms and legs start feeling really tired so he drops off. Leaving Brooklyn the only guy left on the pole, which makes his alliance hope that he can hold on and become paymaster. Brittanya slides down the pole and worries that if she falls of the pole she will drown cause she does not know how to swim, that motivates her to hold up longer on the pole. Corn Fed starts to get tired and notices that Hot Wings and Mindy look very comfortable on the pole and feels safe as she knows that if one of them is Paymaster she will be safe, and sees that Brittanya will probably fall off soon, she then takes herself off. Brittanya ends up falling off the pole. Brooklyn, Hot Wings and Mindy all maintain comfortable positions on the pole although they do start to feel a lot of pain. Brooklyn tries to hang on as longs as he can but can not end up doing so and falls off the pole, which leaves the final two Hot Wings and Mindy. Hot WIngs then asks Mindy to let her be Paymaster so she can void Punishers check as he would be extremely angry if she did. Mindy feels unsure at first to trust Hot Wings as she thinks Hot Wings might not save her. After Hot Wings swears on most of her families life to save Mindy she finally gets off the pole and makes Hot Wings paymaster.

On the way back to the house Corn Fed, Mindy and Hot Wings try to persuade Brittanya to vote everyone in the male alliance in the box. Brittanya agrees into voting for them. Hot Wings asks Francisco to vote for the guys as they need the votes to swing their way and also for the fact that Francisco is not in the male alliance as his enemy is Punisher. He then agrees to voting for them. Also he decides to vote with them knowing that he has a huge target on his back. In the vault Francisco keeps his word and votes for all the guys along with Corn Fed and Mindy but Brittanya goes back on her word and ends up voting with the guys for Corn Fed, Mindy and Francisco. In the end Corn Fed, Mindy and Francisco all have 4 votes each whilst the guys and Brittanya only have 3 votes putting Francisco, Mindy and Corn Fed in the box. On the power outing they all plead their case, Mindy says she made her word to saving her and is an alliance with her, Corn Fed says that she is also in an alliance with her and she should not be eliminated, Francisco says that he and her are a strong target to be sent home and that she should save him cause if he goes home she will be the main target in the house whether if he is there he will be a more stronger target to be sent home and she will end up being safe. After the power outing Punisher goes up to Hot Wings and offers her to be a replacement for Garth in his alliance if she sends Francisco home, Hot Wings considers it but is not completely sure yet whom to send home. At elimination Hot Wings calls up Mindy first and saves her as she was loyal and he made a promise to Mindy. Next called up is Corn Fed, she feels she is safe as they are in an alliance, But Hot Wings says to her "You're the male alliance's pawn they will always put you in the box to save one of their own" and tells craig to void her check. Hot Wings said sorry to her, but she did feel a bit betrayed. When Francisco came up Hot Wings explained why she had saved him which was what he said before about them being the big targets and her being safe if it ever comes down to the two of them up for elimination. After Francisco gets his check he says to Punisher "i'm like that herpes on your lip that you got from one of your clients that keeps coming back" in response Punisher says "I control you" It is now in the house Mindy, Hot Wings and Francisco vs Punisher, Brooklyn, 6 Gauge and Brittanya.
