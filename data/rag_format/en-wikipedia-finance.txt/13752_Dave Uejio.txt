### Department of Housing and Urban Development

Uejio was nominated by President Biden to be an assistant secretary of housing and urban development for fair housing and equal opportunity on June 24, 2021.

His nomination was resubmitted in January 2023 and was reported out of committee but it expired in January 2024 and was not resubmitted.
