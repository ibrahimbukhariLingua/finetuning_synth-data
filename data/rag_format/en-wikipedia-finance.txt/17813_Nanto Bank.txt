# Nanto Bank



**The Nanto Bank, Ltd.** (株式会社南都銀行, *Nanto ginkō*) is a Japanese regional bank that mainly operates in Nara Prefecture, Japan. The bank, established in June 1934, has 136 domestic branches in Nara, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Mie, Wakayama, and Tokyo as well as representative offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China.

The Nanto Bank commands 48.4% of all deposits and 50.5% of all lending in Nara Prefecture that mainly serves as bedroom communities for neighboring Osaka, with a population of 1,421,000. The total assets of the bank reached 4.61 trillion yen as of March 2009.

The bank provides general banking services such as deposits, loans, and exchange transactions, as well as other financial services including securities brokerage, letter of credit, credit cards, leasing, and software development. Due to the recent shrinking tendency in population in Nara, the strategy of the Nanto Bank is to seek growth in neighboring Osaka while providing wealth management products to the retail banking market in Nara.

India's largest power producer NTPC has agreed a loan of Rs 3,582 crore with Nanto Bank in 2020. The loan funds are for Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) and renewable energy projects.

Nanto Bank has initiated structural reforms in 2020, under which it plans to reduce the number of branches by about 30 per cent in 10 years and also reduce the number of employees to about 2,000 (from 2,500) in five years.
