Velshi regularly was a substitute anchor for CNN/U.S. programs such as *American Morning*. On Saturday and Sunday he co-hosted a business program called *Your Money*. Velshi also hosted CNN's *Energy Hunt*, which took him to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to the Oil Sands of Canada in 2008.

Being Muslim, Velshi regularly acknowledges his background and perspective when discussions involve Islam. Velshi has strongly defended the Muslim community's right to build a mosque and Islamic center (Park51) near Ground Zero in New York City. Velshi has also been critical of Peter King's hearings on Islamic radicalization in the United States as a form of Islamophobia, branding King as "naive". Velshi supports the separation of mosque and state and rejects "Political Islam", which requires the implementation of Sharia law.
