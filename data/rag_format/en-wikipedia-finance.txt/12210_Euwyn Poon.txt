## Early Startups

In 2010, Poon founded Opzi which later became the software platform behind the First Round Network.


## Spin

In 2017, Poon and co-founders Derrick Ko and Zaizhuang Cheng started Spin, which became the first company to launch a shared micro-mobility solution in the United States when it launched orange-colored bicycles with GPS-enabled locks in Seattle in July. In early 2018, Spin introduced electric scooters to its fleet of shared vehicles, which resulted in rapid growth of the business until its acquisition by Ford in November. Spin operated as the micro-mobility unit of Ford as part of Ford Smart Mobility until March 2022, when it was acquired by Berlin's Tier Mobility, a leading shared mobility company.
