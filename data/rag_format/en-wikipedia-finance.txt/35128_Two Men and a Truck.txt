# Two Men and a Truck



**TWO MEN AND A TRUCK** is an American franchised moving company, headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, with franchises in 48 U.S. states, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Ireland. The company is the largest franchised moving company in the United States with more than 380 franchised locations worldwide.


## History

The company was founded in the early 1980s by two Lansing brothers, Brig and Jon Sorber. Using an old '66 Ford pickup truckᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, they performed moves to earn extra spending money. Their mother, Mary Ellen Sheets, obtained the sketch for the logo for their new company from Sharleen Humes Johnson of Warren, Ohio through a mutual friend of Mary Ellen Sheets, Mr Joseph D'Amore, also of Michigan. The simple line drawing with the two stick-figures logo still represents *Two Men and a Truck* today. Sheets took over the business when her sons left for college. In 1985, she purchased a 14-foot (4.3 m) truck for $350 and hired a pair of movers. This is the only money Sheets personally invested in the company. A fellow panelist at a university business seminar in 1988 suggested Sheets consider franchising. After further research, the first franchise was awarded in 1989.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
