Beneish M-score


# Beneish M-score



**The Beneish model** is a statistical model that uses financial ratios calculated with accounting data of a specific company in order to check if it is likely (high probability) that the reported earnings of the company have been manipulated.


## How to calculate

The Beneish M-score is calculated using 8 variables (financial ratios):

* Days Sales in Receivables Index

(DSRI)
DSRI = (Net Receivablesₜ / Salesₜ) / (Net Receivablesₜ-₁ / Salesₜ-₁)

* Gross Margin Index (GMI)

GMI = [(Salesₜ-₁ - COGSₜ-₁) / Salesₜ-₁] / [(Salesₜ - COGSₜ) / Salesₜ]

* Asset Quality Index (AQI)

AQI = [1 - (Current Assetsₜ + PP&Eₜ + Securitiesₜ) / Total Assetsₜ] / [1 - ((Current Assetsₜ-₁ + PP&Eₜ-₁ + Securitiesₜ-₁) / Total Assetsₜ-₁)]

* Sales Growth Index (SGI)

SGI = Salesₜ / Salesₜ-₁

* Depreciation Index (DEPI)

DEPI = (Depreciationₜ-₁/ (PP&Eₜ-₁ + Depreciationₜ-₁)) / (Depreciationₜ / (PP&Eₜ + Depreciationₜ))

* Sales General and Administrative Expenses Index (SGAI)

SGAI = (SG&A Expenseₜ / Salesₜ) / (SG&A Expenseₜ-₁ / Salesₜ-₁)

* Leverage Index (LVGI)

LVGI = [(Current Liabilitiesₜ + Total Long Term Debtₜ) / Total Assetsₜ] / [(Current Liabilitiesₜ-₁ + Total Long Term Debtₜ-₁) / Total Assetsₜ-₁]

* Total Accruals to Total Assets (TATA)

TATA = (Income from Continuing Operationsₜ - Cash Flows from Operationsₜ) / Total Assetsₜ

The formula to calculate the M-score is:


## How to interpret

The threshold value is -1.78 for the model whose coefficients are reported above. (see Beneish 1999, Beneish, Lee, and Nichols 2013, and Beneish and Vorst 2020).

* If M-score is less than -1.78, the company is unlikely to be a manipulator. For example, an M-score value of -2.50 suggests a low likelihood of manipulation.
* If M-score is greater than −1.78, the company is likely to be a manipulator. For example, an M-score value of -1.50 suggests a high likelihood of manipulation.

### Aggregate recession predictor

A 2023 research paper will use an aggregate score of many companies to predict recessions. It finds that the score in early 2023 is the highest in some 40 years.


## Important notices

* Beneish M-score is a probabilistic model, so it cannot detect companies that manipulate their earnings with 100% accuracy.
* Financial institutions were excluded from the sample in Beneish paper when calculating M-score since these institutions make money through different routes. Sales and receivables which are two main ingredients that go into the Beneish formula are not used when analyzing a financial institution.

## Example of successful application

Enron Corporation was correctly identified 1998 as an earnings manipulator by students from Cornell University using M-score Noticeably, Wall Street financial analysts were still recommending to buy Enron shares at that point in time..
