Fribourg gulden


# Fribourg gulden



The Fribourg *Gulden* was a currency denomination worth 14 *Batzen* of the Swiss canton of Fribourg until 1798.

Fribourg's basic currency unit was the livre (later franc or frank), divided into 10 *batzen* or 40 *kreuzer*. The French silver écu was equivalent to 4 francs or 40 batzen.

The écu was also equivalent to 4 Franken of the Helvetic Republic, and afterwards to 4 Fribourg frank.
It was subdivided into 14 *Batzen*, each of 4 *Kreuzer* or 16 *Denier*. It was replaced by the Frank of the Helvetian Republic in 1798. This was, in turn, replaced by the Fribourg Frank.
