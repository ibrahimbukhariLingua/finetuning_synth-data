East Asian Bureau of Economic Research


# East Asian Bureau of Economic Research



The **East Asian Bureau of Economic Research** (**EABER**) is a forum for economic research and analysis of the major issues facing the economies of East Asia.

Based at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University, it coordinates a network of think tanks and research institutions throughout the region including representatives from Japan, China, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia.

EABER's primary role is the coordination of collaborative research projects on topics relating to the Asian economy. Recent projects have focused on the Asian Century, the impact of Chinese ODI and the role of the G20 in Asia. Bringing together expertise from across the region, EABER also hosts a series of academic conferences and public policy events to share and disseminate ideas on the Asian economy. The East Asia Forum - an EABER-run online publication - provides a platform for the latest research, accessible to policymakers, the wider academic community, and members of the public.


## History

EABER was established by Professor Peter Drysdale, the current Director, to provide greater access to quality economic analysis through building research capacity and developing partnerships within the academic and policy community throughout the region. It was officially launched, alongside the EAF, in 2006, by the then Treasurer, Peter Costello.


## Aims

EABER seeks to promote the integration of Asian economies through research that establishes and measures the potential for integration, and identifies barriers that exist.

EABER aims to improve the policy making process by providing evidence-based economic analysis to policy-makers, and by fostering stronger ties between academic and policy communities.

EABER establishes links between academics and institutions throughout the Asia-Pacific region, seeking to promote debate, encourage cooperation, and improve the communication of ideas.
