Gyda Oil Field


# Gyda Oil Field



**Gyda** (Norwegian: *Gydafeltet*) is an offshore oil field located in the southern Norwegian section of the North Sea, along with the Ula, Tambar and Tambar East fields making up the UGT area, usually attributed to DONG Energy's main areas of exploration and production activity. The Gyda field was discovered in 1980 and started producing on June 21, 1990. The field contains confirmed 39.6 million m³ of oil and 6.6 billion cubic meter of natural gas.


## Ownership

Originally developed by BP, in 2003 it sold its interests (61%) in the Gyda Oil Field to the Canada-based Talisman Energy for $90 million. Talisman operated the field until it was inherited by Repsol in 2015 as part of the acquisition of Talisman and assumed the operatorship on behalf of the licence. Partners of Talisman Energy, DONG Energy and Norske AEDC AS (NAEDC), owned by Arabian Oil Company (AOC), hold 34% and 5% interest in the project, respectively. Capital spending on Gyda was expected to be $131 million.


## Production

Gyda is located in approximately 66 m (217 ft) of water. The main reservoir stands at 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in the Upper Jurassic Ula Formation. The field has one conventional steel facility with production, drilling, living quarters. Gyda currently produces an average of 10,000 bbl/d (1,600 m³/d). The field also produces excessive amount of water making the oil production stable. Due to the difficulties, the production license was extended to 2018. Several new wells are currently being drilled. The produced oil is transported by a pipeline to Ekofisk oil field and on to Teesside for refining.
