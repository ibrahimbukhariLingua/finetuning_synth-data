Oblisco Capitale


# Oblisco Capitale



The **Oblisco Capitale** is a megatall skyscraper currently approved in the New Administrative Capital of the Republic of Egypt. Announced in 2018 as part of the Egypt Vision 2030, the tower aims to surpass the height of the Burj Khalifa, targeting a proposed height of 1000 meters (1 kilometer).

Designed by the Egyptian architectural firm IDIA, based in Giza, the skyscraper is planned to resemble a Pharaonic obelisk, with an integrated water channel that symbolizes the Nile River. The project encompasses 210 floors and is planned to be a mixed-use complex, including amenities such as residential units, hotel apartments, shops, and restaurants.


## Location

The Oblisco Capitale is planned to be positioned in the central business district of Egypt's New Administrative Capital.


## Design

The architectural design of Oblisco Capitale is a mix of Pharaonic and Art Deco styles. The aesthetics draw heavily from the traditional forms of Ancient Egyptian obelisks, embodying a blend of modern ambition and historical reverence. Noteworthy features include rotating louvres that adapt to the sun's path, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency and reducing heat exposure, contributing to its anticipated LEED certification status.

The facade is influenced by the design of the Egyptian water lily, a symbol integral to Ancient Egyptian culture, which thrived along the Nile for millennia. Planned features also include green terraces and communal spaces that promote environmental sustainability and community engagement.
