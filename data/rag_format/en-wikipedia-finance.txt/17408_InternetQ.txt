## Business areas and products


### Mobile entertainment

Akazoo is InternetQ's social music streaming platform. It allows for payment via mobile platforms, cutting out the need for a credit card in places where banking infrastructures are less established. Akazoo is sold direct to consumers or can be ‘white labelled’ by mobile operators, brands and device manufacturers.


### Mobile advertising

One of InternetQ's original products was MobiDialog, a mobile marketing platform through which third party advertisers could submit messages to users and track interactions. Advertisements are delivered via SMS and include polling surveys, sweepstakes, coupons, mobile games and mobile music.

In 2013, InternetQ launched MiniMob.com. This platform was developed specially for application developers and publishers, who use it for mobile advertising to promote their apps.


## Controversial practices in Poland: Facebook marketing and the Polish lottery case

Polish news sources report that InternetQ subsidiary Mobile Dialogue engaged in controversial marketing practices aimed at subscribing users to paid services. This activity took place mostly through Facebook. News items were placed into users feeds. When a user attempted to view these items they were prompted for their cellphone number and a PIN. According to Polish news reports, users were then led into subscribing to the paid services.

In November 2011 InternetQ was sued in Polish courts over an SMS lottery they had been conducting. The plaintiffs argued that they received an SMS claiming that they had won 20,000 PLN (approx 4,700 EUR) and all they had to do was reply with a blank SMS. While they were charged for sending the SMS, they received no payout. The court initially found for the plaintiff and awarded damages of 60,000 PLN (approx 14,000 EUR), but this was overturned on appeal. The case brought discussion about the structure of Polish anti-spam laws, which did not successfully prevent such situations. As of 2011, claims against InternetQ in Poland related to their mobile marketing practices totaled €432,000.


## Investors Fraud Claims

A report published by Quintessential Capital Management firm, an American hedge fund based in New York, on Sunday, April 19, 2020 claimed that InternetQ's Akazoo has been deceiving investors. The firm's stock immediately tumbled in NASDAQ trading and eventually was suspended trading. On October 27, 2021 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it had settled charges against the firm for $38.8 million after the firm allegedly defrauded investors out of tens of millions of dollars.


## Financial results

For the year ended 31 December 2013 InternetQ reported €104.42 million in revenue, a 42% increase over 2012. Profit before tax was €9.01 million and total assets accounted for €111.89 million.
