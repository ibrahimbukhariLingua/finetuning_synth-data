# MegaLink



**MegaLink** (also spelled as **Megalink**) is a Philippine-based developer of mobile and banking software as well as a service provider for banks, specifically for Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) networks and point of sale systems for banks. It was established in 1989; it was later repurposed in 2015.


## History

MegaLink was formed in September 1989 by Equitable Banking Corporation (now merged with Banco de Oro), Far East Bank and Trust Company (now part of BPI), Philippine National Bank (currently a BancNet member), and United Coconut Planters Bank.

MegaLink was launched on March 19, 1990. MegaLink was linked with both BancNet and Expressnet. In 1992, the banks of ATM Bersama, an Indonesian interbank network, turned to MegaLink's expertise as their model for a shared services network. MegaLink launched the Debit Bills Payment as well as purchases via POS terminals in 1993. A year later, MegaLink introduced telephone banking.Tʰⁱˢ ᵖᵃʳᵃᵍʳᵃᵖʰ ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ(ˢ)

In 2006, the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) signed up MegaLink as a founding member in the Philippines. In 2011, MegaLink was interconnected with the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearings Institute (KFTC) in South Korea. MegaLink implemented a Telco-agnostic mobile banking service. In 2013, MegaLink also interconnected with National ITMX in Thailand.Tʰⁱˢ ᵖᵃʳᵃᵍʳᵃᵖʰ ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ(ˢ)

In late January 2015, MegaLink and BancNet announced their merger. BancNet is the sole surviving entity, while MegaLink has been repurposed. MegaLink now lists itself as a BancNet member under the independent ATM deployer category. Following the repurposing, MegaLink and its assets were sold to the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, of which MegaLink is now a subsidiary.
