Kraków University of Economics


# Kraków University of Economics



**Krakow University of Economics** (Polish: *Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Krakowie*, UEK) is one of the five Polish public economics universities. CUE came into existence in 1925. It is the biggest university of economic sciences in Poland. Krakow University of Economics is one of the three largest universities in Kraków, after Jagiellonian University and the AGH University of Science and Technology. The motto and mission of the university in Latin is "Rerum cognoscere causas et valorem" (in English "To learn the causes and values of things. To provide universal education. To bring together professional and general knowledge of methodological and theoretical character.") Its 17-acre (69,000 m²) campus is in the vicinity of historical medieval Old Town of Kraków and easily accessible both on foot or by public transportation. In addition to the main campus in Kraków, the university has seven Remote Teaching Centers in the cities of the region.


## History

The university opened its doors on October 1, 1925, as College of Commerce (*Wyższe Studium Handlowe*).

On 6 November 1939, as a part of Sonderaktion Krakau operation, the Nazis arrested professors of Cracow universities who later were executed or sent to concentration camps. Among them were four professors of the academy: Arnold Bolland, Zygmunt Sarna, Walenty Winid and Albin Żabiński, as well as many professors of other universities who were running some classes at the academy.ᶜⁱʳᶜᵘˡᵃʳ ʳᵉᶠᵉʳᵉⁿᶜᵉ Two buildings of the school were seized, and numerous library books and documents were lost. Classes continued surreptitiously throughout the war, until the school was able to reopen in 1945. The school was nationalized in 1950 and renamed as Higher School of Economics (*Wyższa Szkoła Ekonomiczna*).

In 1974 it was renamed again, as Kraków Academy of Economics (*Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie*). In 2007 it received its current name: Cracow University of Economics (*Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Krakowie*).
