## History and company growth

Founded in 2002, the company started off with a single call center out of Senegal only functioning with a maximum capacity of 300 employees/'callers'. PCCI Group is furthermore in partnership with its parent company: the Teyliom Group. With Teyliom Group offering services generally considered to be part of Telecommunications services, the partnership was struck up quite naturally due to the two companies complementing each other's functions. PCCI started its operations with Orange in France by offering services in the field of customer acquisition and commercial telemarketing and continued growing to offer national and international, multichannel services. The company is continuing to establish itself in the call-center and telecommunications market, often being recognized for its consistent and branded customer service. Since opening its doors in 2002, the group has constantly continued to expand its activities with the opening of various subsidiaries in a variety of African countries through the years; an example of this is the opening of its subsidiary in Côte d'Ivoire in 2010 after having partnered up with MTN Côte d'Ivoire in 2007.
