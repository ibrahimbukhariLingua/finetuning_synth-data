### Coal

OKD is a major mining company in the Czech Republic.

Coal usage: 2019 40.9 Mt, 2020 31.5 Mt, 2021 31.4 Mt, 2022 35.1 Mt

The country aims to phase out coal power by 2038 or earlier.


### Oil and gas

Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic are in Moravia.

Crude oil from Russia comes through the Druzhba pipeline via Ukraine. The Ingolstadt–Kralupy–Litvínov pipeline can bring crude oil from Germany and be connected to the Transalpine Pipeline.

The Country has two refineries, owned by Česká rafinérská. The Litvinov refinery needs to be modified to process non-Russian grade oil.

The Gazela Pipeline allowed gas to be supplied from other countries by connecting through Germany at Brandov or Rozvadov or through Slovakia via Lanžhot.

Gas usage: 2020 8.8 Bcm, 2021 9.4 Bcm, 2022 7.8 Bcm, 2023 7.1 Bcm.


## Electricity

In 2022 Electricity production was 78.8 terawatt-hours (TWh), whilst consumption was 60.4 TWh.

53.60% was generated from fossil fuels, mostly lignite, 40.95% nuclear and 5.46% renewables.


## Environment

In 2014, the emissions of carbon dioxide were 10.4 tons per capita. The EU average was 7.9 tons per capita. Czech Republic's emissions were comparable to those of Japan or the Netherlands.


### Renewable energy

In 2023, the city of Brno is working to modernise its heat generation and distribution infrastructure. Teplárny Brno received a €75 million loan from the European Investment Bank for this modernization. The initiative aims at lowering the country's reliance on oil imports, and consists of a wood chip-fuelled heat and power biomass unit.


## Business

According to Forbes list of billionaires (2011) Czech billionaire Zdenek Bakala ($2 B 2011) has made his wealth in coal business. Forbes ranked Zdenek Bakala (Net Worth$1.5 B) as richest Czech in energy business (coal) in 2013.

Bakala is the biggest player on the coal market in Central Europe. He has consolidated Polish mining markets into his company New World Resources.
