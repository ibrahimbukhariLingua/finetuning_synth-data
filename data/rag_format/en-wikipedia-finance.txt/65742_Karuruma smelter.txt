Karuruma smelter


# Karuruma smelter



The **Karuruma tin smelter** is a tin smelting plant in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, currently operated by the company **LuNa Smelter Ltd**. The plant was previously operated by **Phoenix Metal Ltd**.

The Karuruma tin smelter was built in the early 1980s to produce tin from concentrate coming from the ***Société des Mines du Rwanda*** (SOMIRWA). SOMIRWA managed the smelter until 1985 when it went bankrupt. The smelter was reopened at the end of 1990 by a company called ***ALICOM*** but was closed again in April 1994 when the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsis started. The Government of Rwanda, who owned the smelter, sold it as part of its privatisation program. The plant is located near Kigali, the Rwandan capital.


## Company history under NMC Metallurgie

In 2002 The Tin Smelter has been bought by NMC Metallurgie. Until end of 2003 the technical teams worked on the investment and maintenance in order to repair the factory, import and install the missing machinery, restart the smelting activity with an optimisation of the process. In June and December 2003 tests have been done with success and the industrial production was ready to start by the end of 2003. In 2005 the company decided to change the name of the company to "Phoenix Metal" and to change also the memorandum of association. The price of electricity, the power cut and a problem of quantity of row material had obliged to stop the smelting activity.

In 2006, the company tested a new process based on an exothermic process. Those tests were a technical success but the second increase of the price of the electricity in December 2005 and the remaining problem of quantity of raw material were not covered by the positive aspects of the new process. Five years after the privatisation, a complete technical and financial audit has been conducted by the Privatisation to see if the conditions of the contract were respected by both parties. It has been decided between the parties, that Phoenix Metal haven‟t any more obligation. Phoenix Metal has promised to keep in mind smelting and will do a special effort to restart the smelter at first opportunity.

In 2017, the company entered receivership and was bought by the Rwandan government for RWF1.2 billion.
