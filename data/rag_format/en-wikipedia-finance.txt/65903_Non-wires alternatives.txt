Non-wires alternatives


# Non-wires alternatives



**Non-wires alternatives** (NWAs) are electric utility system investments and operating practices that can defer or replace the need for specific transmission and/or distribution projects, at lower total resource cost, by reliably reducing transmission congestion or distribution system constraints at times of maximum demand in specific grid areas. Transmission-related NWAs are also known as non-transmission alternatives (NTAs). They can be identified through least-cost planning and action, one geographic area at a time, for managing electricity supply and demand using all means available and necessary, including demand response, distributed generation (DG), energy efficiency, electricity and thermal storage, load management, and rate design.


## Examples of States Using NWAs

* Maine's Booth Bay Harbor Pilot Project
* California “loading order” and energy storage mandates
* Public purpose, including microgrid projects under development in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York
* Massachusetts’ required grid modernization plans
* New York's Brooklyn/Queens Demand Management Program
* Vermont's transmission deferral projects
