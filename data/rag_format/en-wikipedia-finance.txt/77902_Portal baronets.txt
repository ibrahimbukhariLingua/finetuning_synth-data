# Portal baronets



The **Portal baronetcy**, of Malshanger, Church Oakley, in the County of Southampton, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 18 April 1901 for Wyndham Portal, Chairman of the London and South Western Railway Company. His son, the second Baronet, became chairman of the family's banknote paper mill company in Laverstoke, Portals Limited, which had manufactured banknote paper for the Bank of England since 1724, and deputy chairman of the London and South Western Railway Company. He was succeeded by his son, the third Baronet. He was also chairman of Portals Ltd, and served as Minister of Works during the Second World War. He was created **Baron Portal**, of Laverstoke in the County of Southampton, in 1935, and **Viscount Portal**, of Laverstoke in the County of Southampton, in 1945. Both titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Portal was childless and on his death the peerages became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his 84-year-old uncle, the fourth Baronet. He was President of the Trustee Savings Banks Association. On his death the title passed to his son, the fifth Baronet. He was chairman and director of Portals Ltd. As of 2010 the title is held by his son, the sixth Baronet, who succeeded in 1984.

Sir Bertram Portal (1866–1949), third son of the first Baronet, was a Brigadier-General in the British Army.
