## History

The company was established in 1992 by Sergei Plastinin [ru] (the father of fashion designer Kira Plastinina) and Mikhail Dubinin. The business began with a leased juice bottling line and a loan of US$ 50.000. Plastinin and Dubinin invited David Iakobachvili. Together with other partners, they leased a juice bottling line at the Lianozovsky Dairy Plant [ru]. The first name for the juices was given the name of the company itself: the word "Wimm Bill Dann" was coined in assonance with the English "Wimbledon". The company was one of the first Russian producers of fruit juice under the "J7" brand.

In response to a decline in the census of dairy cattle in Russia, the company spent US$7 mm in 1999 to modernize its suppliers' milking and refrigeration equipment.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### PepsiCo acquisition

On 2 December 2010, PepsiCo agreed to buy Wimm-Bill-Dann. During the first stage PepsiCo bought 66% of Wimm-Bill-Dann for $3.8 billion. The purchase was one of the biggest foreign investments yet seen in Russia outside the energy industry. Following the acquisition, the company delisted its stock from the New York Stock Exchange in 2011. The deal was completed in several stages entirely (100%) by December 2011 through a multi-stage acquisition from founding shareholders, management and free float. The acquisition was the second-largest in PepsiCo history (after its earlier acquisition of Quaker Oats).

Months following its acquisition of the company, PepsiCo was alerted of possible accounting improprieties by an anonymous whistle-blower. PepsiCo hired the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to conduct an investigation of Wimm Bill Dann, which revealed widespread compliance issues including potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations. PepsiCo general counsel Maura Smith commissioned a memo which blamed PepsiCo's European management and compliance reporting systems for previously overlooking these improprieties, but her employment ended for undisclosed reasons before the memo was finalized. Following these events, the Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation as to whether Smith was fired in retaliation for her actions.
