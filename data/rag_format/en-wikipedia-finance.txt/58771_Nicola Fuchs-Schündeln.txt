## Research

Nicola Fuchs-Schündeln has performed extensive research on the economic effects of German reunification. Among else, findings of her research include the following:

* Their experience with socialism has made East Germans more in favour of state intervention than West Germans, though complete convergence of preferences is expected to occur within one to two generations (with Alberto Alesina).
* Risk-averse individuals self-select into occupations with low income risks (e.g. civil service), which in turn decreases their need for precautionary savings (with Matthias Schündeln).
* Income inequality was relatively stable until the German reunification but has increased substantially since then, especially after 1998 (with Matthias Sommer and Dirk Krueger).
* With regard to the post-reunification migration of East Germans to West Germany, mostly the old and less educated stayed, the young and educated moved, and older and single migrants returned to East Germany (with Matthias Schündeln).
