# Money (Jamelia song)



"**Money**" is the a song by British R&B singer Jamelia, released as the second single from her debut album, *Drama* (2000), on 21 February 2000. Originally, "Thinking 'Bout You" was to be the second single from the album; a video was filmed and promotional copies of the single were sent to radio stations across the UK. That single was cancelled and the video was never released to the public. "Money" was chosen to replace "Thinking 'Bout You" as the second single from *Drama*.

"Money" is considered by many to be Jamelia's breakthrough hit as the song made the UK top five upon its release, spending 11 weeks inside the UK top 100. The song features reggae star Beenie Man and was co-written by Daniel de Bourg.
