1 Spinningfields


# 1 Spinningfields



**No.1 Spinningfields** (formerly **1 Hardman Square**) is a 92 m (302 ft) tall office tower in the Spinningfields district of Manchester city centre, England.

The development was previously known as 1 Hardman Square which was a proposed 140 m (460 ft) tall skyscraper but was cancelled in 2009. The development was revived in 2014 with a 92 m (302 ft) tall high-rise and the revised design gained planning approval in May 2014. Demolition of the former building on the site, Quay House, began in early 2015 and construction of its replacement began shortly afterwards.


## Background


### 1 Hardman Square (2004–2013)

The high-rise was first proposed in 2004, linking in with the new developments in Spinningfields and the growth in proposals for tall buildings in the city at the time. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 paralysed the development market, particularly in the expensive sector of constructing skyscrapers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2011, it was reported that developers of the tower, Allied London, were on the verge of sealing a £165 million deal with German fund manager, Union Investment. As part of the deal, Union Investments forward-purchased 1 Hardman Square, which gave Allied London the capital to construct the building. Construction of the building was dependent on whether Allied London could sign up tenants for half the building, which reportedly could have taken up to two years as the economy recovered.


### No.1 Spinningfields (2014–2017)

Following the news in 2011 that a deal to build a 350,000 sq ft (33,000 m²) Grade A office tower of 20 storeys was possible, plans for such a scheme were finally released in January 2014 and submitted for planning permission. As of 2023, the building is Manchester's tallest office building built since City Tower was constructed in 1965.


### WeWork exit floors 1 and 2 (May 2024)

In May 2024, WeWork vacated their No1 Spinningfields office amid significant financial troubles and lease renegotiations. Derby-based flexible co-working space company Cubo, took over the floors on a 12.5 year lease.
