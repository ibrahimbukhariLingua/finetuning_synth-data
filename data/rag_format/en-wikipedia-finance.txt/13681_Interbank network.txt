Interbank network


# Interbank network



An **interbank network**, also known as an **ATM consortium** or **ATM network**, is a computer network that enables ATM cards issued by a financial institution that is a member of the network to be used to perform ATM transactions through ATMs that belong to another member of the network.

However, the functions which may be performed at the network ATM vary. For example, special services, such as the purchase of mobile phone airtime, may be available to own-bank but not to network ATM cardholders. Furthermore, the network ATM owner may charge a fee for use of network cards (in addition to any fees imposed by the own-bank).

Interbank networks enable ATM cardholders to have access to ATMs of other banks that are members of the network when their own bank's ATM is unavailable. This is especially convenient for travelers traveling abroad, where multinational interbank networks, like Plus or Cirrus, are widely available.

Interbank networks also permit, through different means, the use of ATM cards at a point of sale through the use of a special EFTPOS terminal where ATM cards are treated as debit cards.

### Philippines

BancNet (also spelled Bancnet) is a Philippine-based interbank network connecting the ATM networks of local and offshore banks, and the largest interbank network in the Philippines in terms of the number of member banks and annual transactions.

BancNet is also the exclusive gateway of China's UnionPay, allowing access to the nearly 1 billion ATM cardholders from the People's Republic of China. BancNet is allied with global payment brand JCB International. Through this alliance, JCB cardholders can now do cash advances at participating BancNet member ATMs nationwide. Bancnet interconnects with international card networks Diners Club, Discover Card, KFTC, MasterCard, and VISA

BancNet serves more than 41 million ATM cardholders of its 114 members and affiliates with over 12,000 ATMs and more than 5,000 POS terminals.

In 2008, Expressnet outsourced its ATM operations to BancNet. On January 30, 2015, BancNet and MegaLink announced their merger and will retain itself as its brand.


### Portugal

This network has existed since 1985 and is owned by SIBS (*Sociedade Interbancária de Serviços*).

### Sri Lanka

Launched under the brand name LankaPay in July 2013, the Common Card and Payment Switch (CCAPS) is the first phase of creating a more robust, efficient, and secure payment infrastructure for Sri Lanka. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has since approved the CCAPS as Sri Lanka's "National Payment Switch".


### United States

Due to the historically fragmented nature of banking in the United States, there have been a large number of small banks, which resulted in a number of different interbank networks being established, mostly along geographic lines. These started to consolidate from the mid 1980s, resulting in three major interbank networks which, by 2003, had over 70% of the volume in the United States:

* STAR
* NYCE
* Pulse

2003 saw the founding of two additional interbank ATM networks:

* Allpoint
* MoneyPass
