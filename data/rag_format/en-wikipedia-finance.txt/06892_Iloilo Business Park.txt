Iloilo Business Park


# Iloilo Business Park



**Iloilo Business Park** (also known as **IBP** or **Megaworld**) is a 92-hectare (230-acre) mixed-use master-planned central business district in Mandurriao, Iloilo City, Philippines by Megaworld Corporation. It is an integrated township project featuring a financial district, a lifestyle mall, office buildings catering to business process outsourcing firms, boutique and deluxe hotels, a convention center, and medical services facilities.

Iloilo Business Park was the site of Mandurriao Airport, the former main airport of Iloilo until 2007, when Megaworld Corporation acquired the property and developed it into a mixed-use development. Since then, the area has experienced significant growth and is now bounded by two other major developments in Mandurriao, namely SM Iloilo of SM Prime to its east and Atria Park District of Ayala Land to its southeast.


## History

It is located on the site of Iloilo's former airport, Mandurriao Airport, which the conglomerate acquired for 1.2 Billion Pesos from the Philippine national government. Megaworld is projected to pour in ₱25 Billion for the entire development in a span of years. Initial development includes construction of a road network, the 12-storey Richmonde Hotel Iloilo and Richmonde Tower, Festive Walk, Two Business Process Outsourcing office buildings. The IT complex has been certified as an information technology park by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), granting locators perks such as tax holidays and duty-free importation of equipment among others.

Megaworld is setting aside a 9.7-hectare lot for the boutique hotel and commercial district which is being offered to interested business owners.

Iloilo Business Park increased by an additional 18 hectares (Sta. Rosa) and another 20 hectares, bringing the project to roughly 92 hectares from its initial 54.5 hectare-size.
This is due to the increasing demand for residential and commercial properties and good reception to Megaworld's first development in the region and biggest township in the Visayas, modeled after the live-work-play approach that it claims to have pioneered in the Philippines.
