**KlickEx** is a New Zealand fintech company that provides a payment system for domestic, low value electronic foreign exchange transactions to Polynesian countries using a smart market retail system.

The company provides exchange clearing service platforms to central bank, commercial bank, nonbank, and non-financial clients in the Pacific Islands, also providing a guaranteed fund, net settlement, retail servicing to mobile money operations across the region, avoiding the usual foreign transfer delays, fees and spreads by matching up individuals (and institutions) or central-bank-settling payments to and from the islands.

Payments can be made between the Pacific Islands and Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. The system also allows users to transfer directly to mobile wallets, and Bank accounts.
