## History

Binary Compass Enterprises, later Bizrate, was founded in June 1996 by classmates at the University of California Los Angeles and Wharton School of Business, Farhad Mohit and Henri Asseily. The pair used a school project they authored while attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania as the basis for their original model of a research company.

The first retailer reviews were collected in 1997 after launching and rebranding the website as Bizrate.com. Services were later expanded to include comparison shopping. In August 1999, Bizrate partnered with Consumer Reports to provide ratings in both the print and online editions of the *Consumer Reports*. During this year, Bizrate also launched its "Don't get e-screwed campaign".

In 2004, Bizrate rebranded to Shopzilla, while still providing ratings and reviews to Bizrate too. In 2010, Bizrate Insights formed a partnership with Google to begin distributing retailer ratings and reviews from Bizrate Insights to Google Product Search and Google AdWords ads. Since then, this has been expanded to include syndication to several partners across the internet.

In June 2005, E.W. Scripps acquired Shopzilla, which included all operating websites and Bizrate Insights. In June 2011, Symphony Technology Group acquired Shopzilla, including all operating websites and Bizrate Insights. In September 2014, Shopzilla.com rebranded to Connexity, Inc.; Bizrate Insights continued to operate under the Connexity umbrella. In June 2015, Connexity acquired PriceGrabber. Customer feedback collected under PriceGrabber was then collected by Bizrate Insights.
