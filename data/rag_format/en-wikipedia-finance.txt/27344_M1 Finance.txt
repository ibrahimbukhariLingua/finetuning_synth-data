## Micro investing service

Micro-investing refers to investing small amounts of money, usually in the range of a few dollars to a few hundred dollars, into financial assets such as stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or other investment vehicles.

Micro-investing increased in popularity in the 2020s in part due to the rise of mobile apps that make it easy and accessible for people to invest small amounts of money with low fees using fractional shares. Micro-investing makes it easier for individuals to build a diversified investment portfolio and start investing even with limited funds.
