Funeral Support Payment


# Funeral Support Payment



**Funeral Support Payment** is a benefit delivered by Social Security Scotland. The benefit is aimed at reducing funeral poverty in Scotland by providing people who receive certain benefits or tax credits with a payment that can be used to help pay funeral costs, burial or cremation costs, travel costs, and medical costs.

The amount of each payment is dependent upon which local authority the person who died resided in. If the person who died left any money or had an insurance policy, this can also impact the total amount paid.


## Origin

Social Security Scotland was established in April 2018 following the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018. Social Security Scotland delivers certain areas of social security policy that was devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the Scotland Act 2016.
