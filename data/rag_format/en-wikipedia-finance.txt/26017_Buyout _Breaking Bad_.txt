Buyout (Breaking Bad)


# Buyout (Breaking Bad)



"**Buyout**" is the sixth episode of the fifth season of the American television drama series *Breaking Bad*, and the 52nd overall episode of the series. Written by Gennifer Hutchison and directed by Colin Bucksey, it originally aired on AMC in the United States on August 19, 2012.


## Plot

After returning from the train heist, Walter White, Mike Ehrmantraut, and Todd Alquist destroy Drew Sharp's body and his dirt bike. Todd glibly dismisses the tragedy, leading an incensed Jesse Pinkman to punch him. After a heated debate, Walt, Jesse, and Mike agree to spare Todd's life and keep him on the payroll with Vamonos Pest.

The DEA begins to surveil Mike, which leads him to leave Walt's meth operation, as does Jesse, who is distraught about Drew's death. They propose to sell the methylamine, which could net them as much as $5 million each. A rival meth dealer offers to buy the methylamine but Walt refuses to sell, because he intends to profit by turning it into meth, which could be worth as much as $300 million. With Walt refusing to sell, Jesse and Mike are also prevented from selling their shares.

While visiting Holly, a tearful Skyler White is tempted to confess to her sister Marie Schrader, but stops short when Marie discloses her knowledge of Skyler's affair with Ted Beneke. Marie mistakenly believes the affair to be the reason for Skyler's mental anguish.

Jesse comes to Walt's house to try to change Walt's mind. Walt refuses to sell and compares the situation to the incident in which he lost millions by selling his 33.33% share of Gray Matter Technologies for $5,000, while the company went on to be worth over $2 billion. He tells Jesse he does not see their enterprise as a drug business but as the building of an empire. Skyler arrives home and Walt insists that Jesse stay for dinner, leading to an awkward meal.

Walt tries to hide the methylamine, but Mike anticipates the move and restrains Walt in the Vamonos Pest offices. Mike and Saul Goodman meet with Hank Schrader and Steve Gomez at the DEA to notify them that Mike has obtained an injunction preventing their continued surveillance of him. Walt frees himself and hides the methylamine. When Mike arrives, he threatens to kill Walt but Jesse interrupts and tells Mike that Walt has a plan to get all three of them their money.

### Critical reception

Donna Bowman of *The A.V. Club* gave it an A rating and called it a "standout episode" for how it "shows Walter offering up two sides of the truth of his life." Seth Amitin, writing for *IGN*, rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, adding that he "love[s] that this show still deals with the emotional impact of [the characters'] own messes." However, Sean T. Collins of *Rolling Stone* felt the episode "stumbled" when it came to "compelling drama in which everyone involved acts in character and within the bounds of recognizable, reasonable human behavior." HitFix's Alan Sepinwall thought "Buyout" was "a bit more muddled" when compared to the previous episodes, adding, "There are incredible individual components — the pre-credits sequence, Walt's improvised blowtorch, even another awkward meal at the White house — but they didn't entirely work together."

Aaron Paul was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in this episode.

In 2019 *The Ringer* ranked "Buyout" 42nd out of the 62 total *Breaking Bad* episodes.
