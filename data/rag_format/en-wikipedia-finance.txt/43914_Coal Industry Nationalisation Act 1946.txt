Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946


# Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946



The **Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946** (9 & 10 Geo. 6. c. 59) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which nationalised, or brought into state control, the coal industry in the United Kingdom. It established the National Coal Board as the managing authority for coal mining and coal processing activities. It also initially provided for the establishment of consumers' councils. The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was the first of a number of Acts promulgated by the post-war Labour government to nationalise elements of the UK's industrial infrastructure; other Acts include the Electricity Act 1947; the Transport Act 1947 (railways and long-distance road haulage); the Gas Act 1948; and the Iron and Steel Act 1949.


## Background

The Coal Industry Nationalisation Bill was published in December 1945 by the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell, and got passed through the House of Commons by his Parliamentary Secretary Hugh Gaitskell. Several commentators have noted that the bill was imperfect and had been 'hastily cobbled together', just four months after the King's Speech. However, this approach was expedient for the government as the coal mining industry was in a poor state following the war and the Labour government wished to show that their manifesto commitments were being implemented.

The coal industry nationalisation was different to later enactments. The owners of coal mines and facilities were compensated with government stock; this demonstrated to the miners, who were powerful political force, that the industry belonged to the nation. For later nationalisations compensation was by stock issued by the relevant board. This simplified the system as compensation was based in the market value of shares in the relevant undertaking.
