## Company history

Barfoot & Thompson was established by Val Barfoot in 1923 out of a tiny Newmarket land agency (purchased for just £75) and was originally called “V. Barfoot Land Agent”.

A year later, Val was joined by his older brother, Kelland, and the name changed to “Barfoot Bros”. In 1934, the Barfoot brothers were joined by Maurice Thompson, and in 1940, the business became “Barfoot & Thompson”, as it is known today.


## Auctions

The company has an in-house team of eight auctioneers. Their head office is at 34 Shortland Street, Auckland. It has a custom-built auction room that seats up to 110 people. They also have auction venues on the North Shore of Auckland, South Auckland and in Whangarei. Barfoot & Thompson auctions are also held on-site at properties.

The company does not participate in the practice of ‘vendor bidding’. This is a type of bid made on behalf of the vendor and is usually made by the auctioneer. Barfoot & Thompson auctioneers will not knowingly accept bids that are not from genuine buyers.


## Partnerships

Barfoot & Thompson's partner network includes NZ Realtors Network, Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, Realestate.co.nz and HouGarden.
