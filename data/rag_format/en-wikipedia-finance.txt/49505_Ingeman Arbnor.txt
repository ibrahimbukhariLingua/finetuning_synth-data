### *Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge*

The book *Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge* (1997) wants to give the reader a foundation for handling questions about knowledge creation and for doing research efficiently and effectively in different situations and for various clients and employers. It describes and compares three different methodological approaches for gaining business knowledge:

* the analytical approach,
* the systems approach,
* and the actor's approach.

The Analytic Approach is the positivist approach, the Systems Approach favors the development of explanatory models and the Actors Approach is more commonly known as "structuration theory," which derives from the work of Anthony Giddens, *Central Problems in Social Theory* from 1979 and *The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration* from 1984.

It then examines the consequences of using each approach in various practical and theoretical situations. Techniques discussed include historical studies, case studies, dialogues, language development, collecting data, measurement, controlling reliability, and validation. Arbnor & Bjerke further argue that qualitative research methods must be consistent with the epistemological presumptions of the researcher, the theory and the research problem.
