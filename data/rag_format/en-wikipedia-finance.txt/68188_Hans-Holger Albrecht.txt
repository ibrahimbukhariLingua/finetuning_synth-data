## Background and early life

Hans-Holger was born in Brussels, Belgium, in 1963 to Heidi Adele and Ernst (Carl Julius) Albrecht, a prominent CDU politician and European Commission official; the Albrecht family had been among the *hübsche* ("genteel") families of the Electorate of Hanover as doctors, jurists and civil servants since the 17th century, but his immediate ancestors had been wealthy cotton merchants in Bremen and members of the city-state's Hanseatic elite in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1971, the family moved to Germany, where Ernst Albrecht became Premier of Lower Saxony (1976–1990). He grew up in Burgdorf in Germany. He graduated in Law at the University of Freiburg in Germany, studied at Yale University, and received a PhD at the University of Bochum in Germany.
