## History

The KLIN Group was founded in Kilmarnock in 1988 by construction veteran, John Dick. During the 2000s, his daughter Marie Macklin took over the running and operations of the business as chief executive officer, which saw the company focus more on property development and regeneration work within Kilmarnock and East Ayrshire. In 2003, the KLIN Group was responsible for introducing Morrisons to a 12 acre site in Kilmarnock where they created Scotland's first Morrisons superstore. The Â£60 million investment package included the restoration of the former Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. headquarters adjacent to the new superstore, as well as for the derelict Opera House building on John Finnie Street.

The KLIN Group was one of the first private sector investors in the regeneration of the Tollcross area of Glasgow. The company completed several brownfield housing developments in the area which led the way for further third party investment.


### KLIN Holdings Ltd.

The KLIN Group now operates as KLIN Holdings Ltd., with Drew Macklin serving as a company director since 2011. KLIN Holdings was originally incorporated into The KLIN Group in 1999.
