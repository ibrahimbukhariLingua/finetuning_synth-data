## History

TMB was the brainchild of Field Marshall Sarit Thanarat. He endeavoured to establish a commercial banking business to provide financial services exclusively to military personnel under the Commercial Banking Act B.E. 2488 (1945). The bank started in 1957, but only opened its first branch, Ratchaprasong Branch, in Bangkok in 1963.

In 1973 it became a full commercial bank with the general public as its customer base. It adopted the slogan, "Thai Military Bank, the Bank for all people". In 2005, TMB adopted the new official name in English, "TMB Bank Public Company Limited", a new corporate logo, and a new slogan, "Better Partner, Better Value".

In 2014, TTB set up FAI-FAH as its main corporate social responsibility programme. FAI-FAH was a learning centre where free courses in cooking, painting, singing, dancing and other subjects are offered to low-income teenagers. The bank created two FAI-FAH centres. Many of the children who have been trained by the center have returned to their communities and initiated community development programme aided by ttb staffers who work as volunteers.¹²,²⁰
