## Accusations

Documents submitted by Transneft to the Russian Audit Chamber in 2008 were found at the disposal of Alexey Navalny, a minority shareholder of Transneft. The papers, published on 16 November 2010, contain information regarding multiple economic crimes committed by Transeft employees including Semyon Vainshtok, its daughter structures and contractors in the construction of the Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline. The documents described Transneft executives' setting up a series of shell companies to pose as contractors for Transneft's pipeline project. Navalny posted an audit indicating that the contracting fraud had cost Transneft US$4 billion. Both Transneft and the government auditing office, whose documents Navalny said he leaked on his site, denied the corruption claim. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called for an investigation into the allegations. All facts of theft and fraud were confirmed by the company management. The reports that recorded the breaches were endorsed by the officials.

Transneft has been repeatedly criticized for the lack of transparency regarding its expenditures on charity. From 2007 to 2011, the company did not disclose information on recipients of these funds. In 2011, Transneft officially published information about its charity expenditures. It turned out that from January to 2011, the company spent on charity 3,21 billion rubles. However, only 52 million rubles were used to support several charity institutions, and 2,55 billion rubles were transferred to the Konstantinovsky charity foundation (its chair was Vladimir Kozhin, a former head the Directorate of the President of the Russian Federation).
