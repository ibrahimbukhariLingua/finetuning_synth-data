## The Opendatasoft solution

Opendatasoft is a SaaS (software as a service) solution that allows companies, local authorities, and public administrations to organize, share, and visualize any type of data (as tables and graphs), as well as make data available via APIs.

The company's founding principles are based on the sharing of public data as open data: historically, its customers include entities of the French government and local French communities. In recent years, Opendatasoft has broadened the scope of its activities and now works with all types of companies, both public and private, in France and around the world. Users of the software can share their data publicly as open data to create services for citizens, users of public transportation, companies, and associations. The data can also be published in a limited way within an organization or a group of organizations for use by partners or employees.

Opendatasoft's customers come from a variety of sectors: energy & utilities, local communities, transportation & mobility, government, banking & insurance, luxury goods, IoT, etc.

To date, Opendatasoft has earned the trust of more than 280 customers worldwide: in Europe (France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal), North America (United States, Canada), Mexico, Australia, and the Middle East.

In particular, the company has developed the open data portals of the City of Paris (Paris Data), the SNCF Group, the GRDF Group, Kering, EDF, the Occitanie Region, Mexico City, Newark, Vancouver, and more.
