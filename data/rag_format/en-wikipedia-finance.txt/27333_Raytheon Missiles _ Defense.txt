Raytheon Missiles & Defense


# Raytheon Missiles & Defense



**Raytheon Missiles & Defense** (**RMD**) was one of four business segments of RTX Corporation. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, its president was Wes Kremer. The business produced a broad portfolio of advanced technologies, including air and missile defense systems, precision weapons, radars, and command and control systems. Raytheon Intelligence & Space was merged with Raytheon Missiles & Defense in July 2023 to form the Raytheon business segment.


## History

The business was a combination of two Raytheon Company legacy businesses, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) and Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), which operated a plant formerly owned by the Hughes Aircraft Company.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Raytheon had been criticized for selling arms to Saudi Arabia that were used in the Yemen Civil War. These sales were blocked by the Obama administration in 2016 due to humanitarian concerns, a decision that was reversed by the Trump administration six months later.

On May 22, 2024, the unit was sanctioned by the Chinese government due to arms sales to Taiwan.
