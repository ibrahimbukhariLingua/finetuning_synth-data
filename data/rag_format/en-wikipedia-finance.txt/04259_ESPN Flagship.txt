ESPN Flagship


# ESPN Flagship



The **ESPN flagship direct-to-consumer service**, commonly shortened in trade media to **ESPN Flagship** or simply **Flagship**, is the working title of an American over-the-top sports video streaming service scheduled to be launched by ESPN Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company in partnership with Hearst Communications, in late summer 2025. The service is expected to include access to all of the content of ESPN's U.S. linear cable channels, as well as ESPN+.

As a direct-to-consumer streaming service, ESPN Flagship will make the main ESPN channel available as part of a standalone sports streaming product for the first time, where it was previously only available as part of traditional subscription TV bundles offered by cable, satellite, and virtual MVPD providers. However, some of these providers have already made arrangements with ESPN to include access to Flagship in their packages.


## Content

ESPN Flagship is expected to include all of the content of ESPN Inc.'s existing linear cable channels, including the flagship ESPN channel. It will also include the content of the ESPN+ direct-to-consumer service, which launched in 2018 and primarily carries events or coverage not available on ESPN's linear channels; Disney has yet to confirm whether ESPN+ will remain available as a standalone service for those that do not need Flagship.


## Development

In May 2023, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that ESPN was working on a project, internally code named "Flagship", to offer its namesake cable channel directly to consumers outside of the cable bundle. As part of this project, ESPN was reported to be in negotiations with cable providers and sports leagues to give it the flexibility to launch such a service. On February 7, 2024, Disney chief executive Bob Iger announced during an earnings call that the service would launch in late August or fall 2025.

To date, Disney and ESPN press releases have referred to the project as the "ESPN flagship direct-to-consumer service" or a similar term; an official name for the service has yet to be announced. Most external trade media have referred to the service as "ESPN Flagship" or simply "Flagship".


## Distribution

Disney has said that all content will be available through both ESPN's own existing app, as well as the ESPN hub on the Disney+ app for those also subscribed to that service. As of February 2025ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, no price has been announced for the service.

In September 2023, as part of its settlement of a carriage dispute with Disney, Charter Communications gained the right to distribute the planned service as part of its existing packages on launch. In September 2024, following its own carriage dispute with Disney, DirecTV secured similar distribution rights for the ESPN flagship service.
