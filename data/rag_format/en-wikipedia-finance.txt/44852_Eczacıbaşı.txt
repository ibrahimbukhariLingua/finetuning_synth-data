## Founder

Dr. Nejat F. Eczacıbaşı (1913–1993), the founder of the Eczacıbaşı Group, used to say that "the real measure of private enterprise is its degree of success in raising the prosperity of society."

Süleyman Ferit Eczacıbaşı was the first university-educated pharmacist in the city of Izmir and had a long career of public service during the early years of the Turkish Republic. In 1909, the İzmir Provincial Congress gave him the title of "chief pharmacist" (Turkish: *baş eczacı*.) With the introduction of the Surname Law in 1934, Süleyman Ferit adopted his title "Eczacıbaşı" as his family name.
