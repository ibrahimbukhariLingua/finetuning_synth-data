Henokiens


# Henokiens



The **Henokiens Association** (French: *l'Association des Hénokiens*) is an international association of family-owned companies that have existed for 200 years or more, with at least one family member still involved in management. Its name is derived from the biblical patriarch Enoch (*Hénoch* in French), who lived for 365 years before he was taken by God instead of dying.

Founded in 1981 by the then-chairman of Marie Brizard, the association started with 4 members from France, and it now has 56 members from Europe and Japan. Its stated objective and *raison d'être* is to promote long-term decision making, notably through its Da Vinci Prize.

The association's oldest member is the Japanese Hōshi ryokan (founded 717), and the most recent members are the Austrian firm Lobmeyr (founded 1823), the Portuguese firm Pinto Basto (founded 1788), the French firm Tarrerias Bonjean (founded in 1585), the Italian firm Acetaia Giusti (founded in 1685), the French firm Denantes (founded in 1723), the Italian firm Colussi S.p.A. (founded in 1791)
