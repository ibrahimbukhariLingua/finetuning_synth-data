They took parts of a material and processing technology originally invented by a German company, and claimed from then on to have developed this technology calling it ¨InnoVidaPanels (Composite Structural Insulated Panels or CSIPs). Using project materials, names and products like being their own property in the beginning they presented it as an alternative to traditional construction materials, with the goal of allowing for faster and cost-effective construction. ¨InnoVida's¨ sandwich panels are similar to the materials used to make watercraft and aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. Uli Schwartau and Claudio Osorio were the founder and co-founder and CEOs of InnoVida. Uli Schwartau was inventor of the technology, Claudio Osorio was previously the CEO of CHS Electronics, Inc.

Tameer Holdings Corporate office building, A 45-foot pyramid, made of InnoVida panels built in UK's Hyde Park and painted by the artist Romero Britto, a $15M USD Factory in Tanzania, a $28M USD project in Chengdu, China for post-disaster reconstruction and new village building.


## Products

InnoVida's composite building materials (CSIPS), are similar to the materials used to make watercraft and aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.

CSIPs reduce building costs by almost half because cement, steel and wood would not be required.
