Institute of Public Enterprise


# Institute of Public Enterprise



The **Institute of Public Enterprise** (IPE) was established in 1964 for the study of issues and policies relating to public enterprise (PEs). S S Khera, ICS, the Cabinet Secretary, Government of India, had conceived the idea of a research institution that would undertake a systematic and sustained study of issues relevant to the formulation of policies towards public enterprises. In the early sixties, when PEs were designed as the principal instrument to serve the social and economic objectives of development, Khera felt a need for an institute that would collect information on PEs, study issues, and undertake consultancy and training for PEs.

V.V. Ramanadham, professor and head of the Department of Commerce, Osmania University, translated Khera's concept into IPE, with support and guidance from D. S Reddy, Vice-Chancellor, Osmania University as an autonomous, non-profit society.

Management education started in 1980 with the start of a three-year part-time MBA(PE) programme. In 1995, the institute started a two-year full-time Post Graduate Diploma in Business Management (PGDBM). Currently, the institute offers various 2 year PGP courses, namely Post Graduation Diploma in Management(PGDM), PGDM – Marketing, PGDM – Banking, Insurance & Finance, PGDM – Human Resource Management, and PGDM – International Business, the courses are recognized by AICTE
