Jomayi Property Consultants Limited maintains its headquarters in a building that the company wholly owns, at 20 Old Kampala Road, on Kampala Hill, in Uganda's capital, Kampala.

As of December 2013, Jomayi has developed nearly 100 residential housing estates, where it buys acreage in bulk, brings utilities (electricity, water and sewerage) to the location, subdivides the land into plots, and sells those to interested end-users. As the property development function has prospered, Jomayi has formed other businesses to complement its business; in the process, forming the Jomayi Group of Companies. Companies in the Group include the following:

1. Jomayi Construction Company – Founded in 2007 to construct houses for clients who were finding it hard to engage honest, reputable builders.
