Indian paisa


# Indian paisa



The **Indian paisa** (plural: *paise*) is a 1⁄100 (one-hundredth) subdivision of the Indian rupee. The paisa was first introduced on 1 April 1957 after decimalisation of the Indian rupee.

In 1955, the Government of India first amended the *Indian Coinage Act* and adopted the "metric system for coinage". From 1957 to 1964, the paisa was called *naya paisa* (transl. 'new paisa') to distinguish it from the old paisa/pice which was a 1⁄64 subdivision of the Indian Rupee. On 1 June 1964, the term "naya" was dropped and the denomination was named *paisa*. Paisa has been issued in 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50 paise coins. Though as of 2023, coins of the denomination of 1 rupee are the lowest value in use.


## History

Prior to 1957, Indian rupee was not decimalised and the rupee from 1835 to 1957 was further divided into 16 annas. Each anna was further divided to four Indian pices and each pice into three Indian pies till 1947 when the pie was demonetised.

## Symbol for Paisa

A symbol for the paisa ⟨⟩ was designed using the same concept as the symbol for rupee. However, the proposed symbol never appeared on any coin, as the Reserve Bank of India had stopped minting any paisa coins before this proposal.
