## Sports gambling

Sports gambling is something that just recently became legalized in the United States. It involves making wagers based on some outcome of a contest or some aspect within the contest. In prior instances of legality, there were multiple incidents of professional athletes/referees committing scandals to increase payouts. The people placing the bets always have worse odds than those hosting the bets and that is how this industry remains profitable.

Sports Betting although PASPA (The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102â€“559) was overturned in May 2018, the individual states are still considering what methods (brick and mortar and online) of sports gambling to allow and where. For example, sports gambling, in certain US states and jurisdictions, may be allowed in established casinos or race tracks. Thus partnerships between bookmakers and gambling license holders will need to be in effect and active before taking any sports bets at venues.

Other considerations regarding legal sports betting remain clear: Offshore sportsbooks and bookmakers operating offshore cannot solicit or do business with American citizens. The 1961 Federal Wire Act - The Wire Act prohibits persons involved in the gambling business from transmitting several types of wagering-related communications over the wires. This basically means that online and telephone sports gambling is still not allowed in the United States. The memo issued by the DOJ in January 2019 can be downloaded here.

Companies offering free sports gambling games known as freemium or F2P games remain unregulated. Fantasy Sports considered by experts as skill games are questionable in certain US jurisdictions. 32 states have either allowed or regulated fantasy sports during the past few years, before the PASPA overturning.


## Sports stadium/travel

Sports are often played in giant arenas that people travel to from all over. People will cross the world to see their favorite team play and some signature arenas can get fans there even if the team isn't having the best season. The construction/ adaption of these stadiums is a huge business in its own as they're often multi-purpose places used for other things like music events as well. The transportation of the players themselves is also a crucial business as keeping them safe and getting them to where they need to be on time can be a hassle.
