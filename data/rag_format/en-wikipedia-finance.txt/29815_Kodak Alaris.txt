Kodak Alaris


# Kodak Alaris



**Kodak Alaris** is a British-based company currently comprising two divisions: *Alaris*, hardware and software for digital imaging and information management; and *Kodak Moments,* retail photo printing kiosks and sales and marketing of traditional photographic film. The company is headquartered in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. The company shares ownership of the Kodak brand with the Eastman Kodak Company (usually known simply as Kodak).


## History

In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after a years-long decline in the company's core film photography business. As part of the bankruptcy, Kodak faced a $2.8 billion claim by the UK Kodak Pension Plan (KPP). The claim was resolved and Kodak Alaris was formed when KPP paid $325 million for Kodak's personalized imaging and document imaging businesses.

In 2014, the company appointed Ralf Gerbershagen as CEO. Also in 2014, Mark Elliott was named chairman of the Board of Kodak Alaris.

In 2015, the company created AI Foundry, which provides business process automation solutions that use artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging science to automate data capture workflows.

In 2016, the company launched Kodak Moments, a visual storytelling app, at the South by Southwest festival. The company closed its only colour paper factory in Harrow, UK and outsourced all RA-4 paper production to Carestream Health, US formerly the Eastman Kodak health group, with production at a facility in Windsor, Colorado.

In 2017, the company appointed Marc Jourlait as CEO, completed a balance sheet restructuring, renewed a rotating credit facility, and completed the sale of its manufacturing facility, Kodak Works in Harrow.

In 2018, the company's Information Management division announced that it would begin to operate under the name Alaris.

In 2020, the Paper, Photochemicals, Display, and Software business was sold to Sino Promise, China which was also a major distributor for Kodak Alaris. This includes Kodak color negative paper, photochemicals (Color process photochemicals for photolabs and B&W retail photo processing chemicals), display substrates (Duratrans, etc.) and printing software businesses. Sino Promise had previously purchased some of the manufacturing assets of Kodak Alaris (formerly Kodak China) and so was already the manufacturer of the color process chemicals and undertook paper finishing. The AI foundry business was also sold to US mortgage company Guaranteed Rate.

On 18 November 2020, Kodak Alaris was formally transferred from KPP to the Board of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). Thus the ownership of the company came directly under the control of the UK pension protection authority. On 1 April 2022 Paul Wells succeeded Mark Alflatt as CEO.

On 1 August 2024 Kodak Alaris was sold by the UK PPF to Kingswood capital management, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm.


## Current businesses

The company is currently organised into two divisions; Alaris and Kodak Moments.


### Alaris

Alaris is focussed on business information capture and management. It had revenues of $196m in 2022 and directly employed 700 staff.


### Kodak Moments

The Kodak Moments business supplies retail self service print kiosks, which enable consumers to make prints of digital images and photo products such as printed mugs, and undertakes the sales and marketing of Kodak still films produced by Eastman Kodak, Rochester, US. The kiosk machines are sourced from original manufacturers and assembled for Kodak Alaris by third party integrators located in US and Germany. Machine consumables are manufactured by a Kodak Alaris facility in the US and a third party supplier in Germany. It had revenues of $314m in 2022 and directly employed 480 staff.


#### Photographic film

Kodak Alaris has the rights to the sale, marketing and distribution of Kodak-branded still film products. Film is produced in 35mm, 120, and sheet film formats. Interest in film photography increased in the second decade of the 2000s, causing a shortage of film worldwide. Manufacturer Eastman Kodak's main business continues to be the production of movie and industrial films, where it retains control over the sales and distribution. However, due to shortage of still films, movie films have also been made available to still film consumers by third parties such as Flic Film and Cinestill.

## Former businesses

* AI Foundry, sold in 2020 to US mortgage company Guaranteed Rate.
* PPDS; Paper, and Processing chemicals, Display and Software sold in 2020 to Sino Promise, China. Sino Promise had previously acquired the Kodak Alaris paper slitting plant in Xiamen, China, in 2015 and the Kodak Alaris photochemical plant in Wuxi, China in 2012, which produces Flexicolor products for RA-4 and C-41 processes. Paper production had already been outsourced to Carestream Health, US and Kodak B&W chemicals to Tetenal, Germany. Therefore, the sale principally concerned the licensing rights to the Kodak name on these products rather than any production facilities.
