## Annual Enterprise Survey on Corruption

The Annual Enterprise Survey on Corruption has provided a unique snapshot of the Filipino business sector’s perspectives on corruption and good governance. By pointing out critical areas for reform, and encouraging private and public sector participation in the fight against corruption, the survey proved to have a powerful impact on the conduct of business and economic growth in the Philippines and proved to be an important tool in raising consciousness about the costs of corruption, in advocating for critical reforms, and in measuring the effectiveness of counter-corruption efforts. The survey results have also served as one of the key indicators used by development organizations, academic institutions, government agencies, and civil society in measuring progress in the fight against corruption.

The Enterprise Survey’s data also help the Filipino public track trends on perceptions of corruption, on attitudes of business people towards corruption, their rating of the sincerity of government agencies in fighting corruption, and the business practices of the private sector in dealing with government agencies. The survey is administered through face-to-face interviews with managers of businesses throughout the country where their responses are based on personal experience.
