## Early life and education

Scorgie was born in Toronto and raised in Calgary. She credits her parents for teaching her about finances and saving. She received her first allowance, a quarter, when she was three. On her 10th birthday, she purchased her first Canada Savings Bond from $100 that she received from her grand parents and decided to save nearly whatever she earned hoping to become financially successful by 25. While she was in high school, she worked at the Calgary Public Library and invested the majority of her earnings into mutual funds and stocks. When she was young, her family faced financial problems which inspired her to learn about saving. Having a job at the library helped her in reading about finance and investments. She purchased her first mutual fund at 14. According to Scorgie, she became financially literate by reading every Warren Buffett book and getting professional investment advice.

Her parents told her that she would have to pay for her college so she started saving. However, when she joined University of Alberta, her savings partly covered her tuition and she had to get loans to pay for the rest. Scorgie graduated from the University of Alberta in 2005 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree in marketing and finance. In 2012, she graduated from the Queen's School of Business with an MBA.

## Books and articles


### *Rich by* series

Scorgie wrote her first book titled *Rich by Thirty: A Young Adult’s Guide to Financial Success* while she was studying at University of Alberta. The book was released in 2007 and became a bestseller six weeks after its release. According to her, she got the idea of writing the book in her first marketing class at University of Alberta when they were discussing serving various market niches and she realized that there was nobody operating in the financial literacy niche for under-30 people. The book provides worksheets, action plans, and tips to help young people save and plan their financial future. Rich by Thirty has been translated into English, French and Korean. An American version of the book has also been released that eliminates references to Canadian savings vehicles and inserts the American equivalents.

She published her second book *Rich by Forty: A Young Couple’s Guide to Building Net Worth* in 2010 and it was named a bestseller after its release in 2010. In order to write the books, she interviewed people from average financial backgrounds and occupations who became wealthy and wrote about what she found common in the people.
