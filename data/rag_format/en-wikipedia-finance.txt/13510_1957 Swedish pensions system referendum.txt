1957 Swedish pensions system referendum


# 1957 Swedish pensions system referendum



A non-binding referendum on reforming the pensions system was held in Sweden on 13 October 1957. Three proposals were put to voters:

1. Employees would have the right to supplement their pension in proportion with earnings whilst working and linked to the 15 years in which they had the highest income. The value of the pension would be guaranteed by the government. Those earning income via other means, such as business owners, would have the right to sign up to voluntary supplementary pensions whose value would also be guaranteed by the government.
2. All income earners would have the right to sign up for voluntary pension supplements, whose value would be guaranteed by the government.
3. All income earners would have the right to sign up for voluntary pension supplements, and changes would be made to legislation to ensure their value is maintained without government involvement. The supplements would be open to collective and individual agreements.

Proposal 1 was put forward by the Social Democratic Party, which was also backed by the Communist Party (now the Left Party) and the Trade Union Confederation. Proposal 2 was put forward by the Farmer's League (now the Centre Party) and proposal 3 was put forward by the Rightist Party (now the Moderate Party) and the People's Party (now the Liberals).

The first option won a plurality of the vote, receiving 46% of the ballots cast. Option 2 was the least popular, receiving only 15% of the vote.
