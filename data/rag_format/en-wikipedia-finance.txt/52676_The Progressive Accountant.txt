# The Progressive Accountant



***The Progressive Accountant*** is an ad driven online ezine oriented exclusively to the accounting industry. It is run from the Progressive Media Group's main office in Middletown, New Jersey, USA and provides news and information in real time. *The Progressive Accountant* offers podcasts, libraries of white papers about firm marketing and technological operations, a software demo page for accounting firms, and Continuing Professional Education, or CPE, webinars.


## Owner

*The Progressive Accountant* is owned and operated by a business-to-business (B2B) publishing group called Progressive Media Group. They manage several similar online publications including *Non-Profit Technology News*, *The Progressive Physician*, *Bob Scott's Insights*, *Non-Profit Career Fair*, and *Medical Jobs World*.


## History

*The Progressive Accountant* was founded as an S corporation in 2006. The company officers immediately approached the Editor-in-Chief of their largest established competitor, Greg LaFollette, CPA of the CPA Technology Advisor, and offered him a position. Lafollette was impressed with *The Progressive Accountant'*s business model of a printless magazine, and believing that printed content delivery was becoming obsolete he accepted the position of Editor in Chief. The Progressive Accountant title quickly drew a number of major advertisers like CCH, Thomson Reuters, ADP Payroll, and Accountant's World. In 2009 the Executive Editor position was taken over by Bob Scott, the former Editor in Chief of *Accounting Technology Magazine* which had been merged into *Accounting Today*.
