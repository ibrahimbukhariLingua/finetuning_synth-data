## Activism

In 2000, Milstein and his wife Gila founded the Adam and Gila Milstein Family Foundation (MFF). The organization sponsors education of students and young professionals to identify with their Jewish roots, and gain knowledge to advocate for the State of Israel and the Jewish people.

Milstein also sits on the boards of StandWithUs, Hasbara Fellowships, and PragerU. He previously served on the boards of Israel on Campus Coalition, Jewish Funders Network, and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) National Council.

In June 2015, Milstein joined with Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban to organize the inaugural Campus Maccabees summit, which opposes anti-Semitic groups and activities on college campuses in the United States. Milstein strongly opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, and has had several op-ed pieces published on this subject.

Milstein and his wife Gila are co-founders of Sifriyat Pijama B'America, which provides free monthly books in Hebrew to Israeli-Jewish American families in the United States. In 2016, they started "The Impact Forum", an initiative which "fights antisemitism, strengthens the state of Israel, and protects American democracy."

In 2016, *The Jerusalem Post* selected Milstein for its list of the world's 50 most influential Jews. In 2015 and 2016, *Algemeiner Journal* named Milstein to its list, "The Top 100 People Positively Influencing Jewish Life."

Gil Troy identifies Milstein as a contemporary leader of cultural Zionism in his book *The Zionist Ideas: Visions for the Jewish Homeland—Then, Now, Tomorrow* (2018). The section on Milstein presents his "vision of Israeliness to invigorate Zionism and Jewish identity—in Israel and abroad."

In 2019, Milstein withdrew from speaking at that year's AIPAC conference after he posted tweets seeking to connect Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to the Muslim Brotherhood.


## Personal life

In undercover footage from *The Lobby – USA*, Eric Gallagher admitted to an undercover reporter that Milstein founded and funds the Canary Mission. However, Gallagher reportedly "told Milstein that *Al Jazeera* had selectively edited his quote to make it appear that he was saying Milstein backed the operation". Milstein claims the documentary's reporting is untrue.
