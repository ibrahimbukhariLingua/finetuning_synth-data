## Summary of report

The panel recommended the formation of a new category of banks called payment bank, to reach people and small businesses who don't have access to banking services. These banks would have low entry requirements and existing banks would be allowed to form subsidiaries under this category. The panel also recommended the formation of another category called wholesale banks, to provide liquidity to other banks and financial institutions which are creating assets in the priority sector. The entry requirement for this category would also be low. The banks would primarily issue loans and would be allowed only to accept deposits larger than INR 5 Crore(₹50,000,000).

The panel proposed that every adult Indian be granted a Universal Electronic Bank Account (UEBA) by January 2016. It also proposed that all low-income and small businesses be given access to banking services by January 2016. It also proposed that an UEBA be automatically opened for every citizen at the amount he/she receives their Aadhaar number.


## Criticism

N. K. Thingalaya, former chairman and managing director of Syndicate Bank, said that there was no need for a new category of banks as several Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) already existed in India. He said that this system of rural banks had been not properly used. M. S. Sriram of Centre for Public Policy said that report failed to address the last-mile delivery problems.
