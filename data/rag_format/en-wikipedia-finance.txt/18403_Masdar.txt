# Masdar



**Masdar** (Arabic: مصدر‎), also known as the **Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company**, is an Emirati state-owned renewable energy company. It was founded and chaired by Sultan Al Jaber in 2006 as a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company. The company is responsible for development of Masdar City, which headquarters the International Renewable Energy Agency.


## History

In 2006, the UAE government established Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC (Masdar) to diversify the entire resources and boost the local economy.

Sultan Al Jaber is the founder and served as the CEO of Masdar when it was founded in 2006. In 2009, he oversaw Masdar’s efforts to secure the presence of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) headquarters at Masdar City, delivering the successful bid in South Korea. In early 2016, Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi was appointed as the chief executive officer of Masdar.

In December 2022 it was announced that the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC (TAQA), Mubadala Investment Company (Mubadala) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) would partner under Masdar brand to form a global clean energy powerhouse focused on renewable energy and green hydrogen.

In March 2024, it was announced Masdar had acquired a 50% stake in San Diego, California-headquartered renewables company, Terra-Gen Power from its parent company, Energy Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount.

Masdar garnered laurels from Austria's ex-chancellor Sebastian Kurz who has been working for the company since 2022. With Austrian Verbund it signed a joint study agreement about large scale green hydrogen production in Spain.


### COP28

During the COP28, Masdar was reported to have hired lobbyists and a public relations firm, First International Resources, to defend its work during the COP28 after criticism from politicians and environmentalists. Masdar chairman and founder Sultan Al Jaber, was the president of COP28. According to the contract, the consultancy was to respond to and deflect negative press reports about Al Jaber. According to *The Guardian*, edits on Wikipedia have been made by a user, who disclosed being paid by Masdar, to make Al Jaber’s role at Masdar more prominent on his page the day after *The Guardian* revealed his appointment as president of COP28.
