In 2010, GLG Partners was purchased by the Man Group for US$1.6 billion. The two remaining GLG founders Noam Gottesman and Pierre Lagrange–Greene had left the company prior to the Man Group purchase–each received a $200 million shareholding in the Man Group in return for a three-year promise to stay.


## Personal life

In 2009, the Sunday Times Rich List reported that his wealth declined £265 million to £195 million due to the credit crunch. In September 2011, his wealth had rebounded to £300 million.

In September 2011, he and his wife Catherine Anspach, with whom he has three children, announced their divorce. The divorce settlement was estimated at more than £160 million. Pierre lives with his husband Ebs Burnough between Monaco, London, Hampshire and New York.

In November 2011, Lagrange sued the Knoedler gallery, New York, for selling him a fake Jackson Pollock painting.

He owned the Grade II listed Woodperry House in Oxfordshire, before downsizing in 2006 to a country house in Hampshire. In August 2011 he also reportedly sold a house at 17 Kensington Palace Gardens to the Russian-born billionaire Roman Abramovich, for £90 million.

Lagrange spoke of his opposition to Brexit in a 2019 interview with the *Financial Times,* characterising the 2016 vote as a "red herring" compared to wider problems facing the UK.
