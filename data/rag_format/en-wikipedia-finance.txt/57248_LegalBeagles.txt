# LegalBeagles



**LegalBeagles** is an organization that offers a forum-based website for consumers to share experiences and assist one another with various consumer and financial issues. It also provides a legal comparison website.


## History

LegalBeagles is an independent consumer rights and consumer law forum. Since May 2007, it has offered support, informal advice, and resources to visitors, registered users, and VIP subscribers.

The forum began as a help site for consumers who wished to reclaim bank charges just before the Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc and Others (2009) case. It continued to advocate for fairness in consumer contracts.

In August 2014, LegalBeagles was involved in obtaining a County Court judgment against Lloyds Bank Plc for unfair terms. In October 2014, they played a role in the Grace & Anor v Blackhorse Court of Appeal ruling, which stated that banks cannot impose a default on an individual's credit file if the credit agreement in question has been deemed unenforceable.


## Services

The forum assists consumers in defending County Court claims as litigants in person and addresses financial and contractual issues. LegalBeagles also campaigns for action against online scams. Additionally, the forum fosters support for employment and family law matters.
