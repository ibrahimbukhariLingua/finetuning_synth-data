## Significance

From 2013 a Coalition flagship policy called the Green Deal was to begin, to update housing stock. With an additional charge on electricity bills, consumers could install energy efficient improvements, the charge running with the electricity meter. The government ended funding for the Green Deal Finance Co in July 2015. It seemed property owners were deterred from using it. (‘It did not provide the government with the kind of instrumental control that CERT did.’) CCC, Report to Parliament 2013, 122 criticised the Green Deal’s lack of takeup.
