Shuttle trade


# Shuttle trade



According to the OECD defininion, **shuttle trade** is "the activity in which individual entrepreneurs buy goods abroad and import them for resale in street markets or small shops. Often the goods are imported without full declaration in order to avoid import duties."


## History

**Shuttle traders** (Russian: челноки, romanized: *chelnoki*, lit. 'shuttles'; Ukrainian: човники, romanized: *chovniki*) were people engaged in the practice of shuttle trade in late Soviet Union and post-soviet states in which traders shuttle backwards and forwards in and out of the country buying goods and then selling them within the country. Originated during the *perestroika* times, it extended well beyond time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in Russia, as well as in many other post-Soviet states.

Shuttlers may carry goods for sale in both directions, and it is often a contraband, based on loopholes in import laws. Often shuttlers are victims of robbery, because they are easily identifiable. Still, the business is attractive. For example, in 2007 it was reported that a St. Petersburg<->Finland shuttler earns 400-600 Euros per trip on average.

In Turkey the practice of shuttle trading is known as "suitcase trade" (Turkish: *Bavul ticareti*) since 1960s when goods for sale were brought from Northern Cyprus in suitcases, hence the term.
