## History

Companhia Zaffari's history began in the 1930s, in a small family.

In 1935, the founder Francisco José Zaffari and his wife, Santina de Carli Zaffari, built a small grocery store, placed in front of the couple's residence, in the Sete de Setembro village on the Erechim city.

Years later, in 1947, Zaffari moved with his family to Erval Grande, where he opened a new store, now better structured. His children's played key role in that growth, helping the father in managing the store.


### Expansion

In the 1950s, the business prospered and the family opened the first branches in neighboring towns. In 1960, the company came to Porto Alegre, opening its first store in the capital, a food wholesale business.

This was the starting point for a new stage of expansion, which resulted in opening the first supermarket, in 1965.

Zaffari's supermarkets are branded with the company name and its hypermarkets got the "Bourbon" brand, but some recent stores, such as Bourbon Wallig and Bourbon São Paulo, their hypermarket were also branded "Zaffari".
