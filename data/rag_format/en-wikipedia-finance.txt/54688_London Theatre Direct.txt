## Company history

London Theatre Direct was founded in 1999 by Francis Hellyer and Emmanuel Ciolfi. Prior to his position at the company, Hellyer was involved in theatre and web technologies and Ciolfi had been working for both the ticketing and hospitality industries. As of 2018, the website had grown to over a million users. London Theatre Direct has been a member of the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers, the UK self-regulatory body for the entertainment and ticketing industry since October 2001.

In 2016, the company invested in developing APIs that allows major venues and theatre groups to connect with its systems to sell tickets in real-time through its own website and partner sites. London Theatre Direct saw a quarterly rise in sales from API partners and venues of more than 600 percent as a result of this investment.

In August 2017, London Theatre Direct adopted TheatreMAD as their chosen charity to help raise funds for HIV and AIDS projects.
