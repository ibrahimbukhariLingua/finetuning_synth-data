## As High Commissioner to Pakistan

From December 2017 to February 2020, Bisaria served as India's High Commissioner to Pakistan. During his tenure, Pakistan and India experienced a decline in bilateral relations – arising from increased violence and terrorism emanating from Pakistan, particularly in the contested region of Kashmir. He was in Pakistan at the time of a terrorist attack by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad in Pulwama, which culminated in the Balakot airstrike, the first instance of aerial combat between Indian and Pakistani air forces since the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Prior to these events, however, Bisaria helped India establish a relationship with the newly elected Tehreek-i-Insaf Government of Prime Minister Imran Khan. He also worked on efforts to expand Indian nationals' access to the Kartarpur Corridor. He returned to India in August 2019, when Pakistan downgraded its bilateral relationship with India. He retained the designation of High Commissioner of India to Pakistan based in India, till February 2020.

In the Indian Civil Service, Bisaria held the rank of Secretary to the Government of India. He was part of the team representing India at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Geneva in September 2019, to promote India's record on human rights.


## As High Commissioner to Canada

In March 2020, Bisaria was appointed High Commissioner to Canada. Bisaria's tenure began during the COVID-19 pandemic and involved facilitating the repatriation of Indian nationals under the Vande Bharat scheme ‘air bubble’. He received a shipment of Indian vaccines sent to Canada in March 2021, along with then Minister for Procurement of Canada, Anita Anand. This gesture under India's Vaccine Maitri program, created greater trust and friendship in India's strategic ties with Canada. Through his tenure, Bisaria worked on the India-Canada economic corridor, stating publicly that the economic partnership should drive the political relationship. He has advocated stronger economic ties ‘between the two Indo-Pacific democracies and G-20 economies’. He is credited with developing strong connections with CEO's and leaders of Canadian pension funds and investment firms, which have ratcheted up investments to over US$60 billion in India, particularly in the infrastructure sector. In this period, several major Canadian firms also stepped up FDI in India. He has pushed for an India-Canada early progress trade agreement which may be finalised in 2022.
