## ICRA Credit Rating

ICRA's credit ratings are symbolic representations of its current opinion on the relative credit risks associated with the rated debt obligations/issues. These ratings are assigned on an Indian (that is, national or local) credit rating scale for Indian Rupee denominated debt obligations. ICRA ratings may be understood as relative rankings of credit risk within India. ICRA ratings are not designed to enable any rating comparison among instruments across countries; rather, these address the relative credit risks within India.

ICRA's ratings (other than Structured Finance Ratings) in the investment grade convey the relative likelihood of default, i.e., the possibility of the debt obligation not being met as promised. All other ratings, including Structured Finance Ratings, reflect both the probability of default and the severity of loss on default, i.e., the expected loss against the rated debt obligation.

Credit ratings aside, ICRA also assigns Corporate Governance Ratings, besides Performance Ratings, Gradings and Rankings to mutual funds, construction companies and hospitals.
