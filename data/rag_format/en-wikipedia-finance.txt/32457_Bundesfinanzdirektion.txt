Bundesfinanzdirektion


# Bundesfinanzdirektion



The **Bundesfinanzdirektionen** were the German federal funding agencies with responsibility to the Federal Ministry of Finance that operated between 2008-2015. On January 1, 2016 it was replaced by the newly established German federal government's General Directorate *Generalzolldirektion*.


## History

In 2008 the Bundesfinanzdirektionen replaced the federal parts of the *Oberfinanzdirektionen* in Germany. This was decided by the Finance Ministry in its draft concept on the future of the federal financial administration on 6 November 2006 and the Law on federal financial administration *Finanzverwaltungsgesetz* was changed accordingly on 1 January 2008. The *Bundesfinanzdirektionen* were the supreme authority for the main customs offices.

On 1 January 2016 the Bundesfinanzdirektionen, the Zollkriminalamt and the Bildungs- und Wissenschaftszentrum der Bundesfinanzverwaltung were transformed into one Generalzolldirektion (General Directorate).


## Structure

The *Bundesfinanzdirektionen* were located in:

The customs and consumption tax directorates of the *Oberfinanzdirektionen* Chemnitz (located in Dresden), Karlsruhe (located in Freiburg im Breisgau), Koblenz (located in Neustadt an der Weinstrasse), Cottbus (located in Potsdam), Hamburg, Cologne and Nuremberg are closed. The subordinate main customs offices are divided between the new *Bundesfinanzdirektionen* and some main customs offices have been attached to other *Bundesfinanzdirektionen* to make the BFD districts more even. This organisational change in the federal financial administration aims to evenly allocate the workload between the *Bundesfinanzdirektionen*. This is why the economically weak east of Germany has only one *Bundesfinanzdirektion* and the strong south and west have three BFDs in Cologne, Nuremberg and Neustadt an der Weinstrasse.
