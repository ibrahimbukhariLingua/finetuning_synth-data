## Arrest

On 3 April 2021, Awadallah was reportedly arrested by the Jordanian Government, along with other high ranking figures.

The day after his arrest, a diplomatic delegation from Saudi Arabia arrived in Amman formally to stand in "full solidarity" with Jordan and supports all decisions and measures taken by King Abdullah II. *The Washington Post* claimed they requested the release of Awadullah. In the past Awadullah was a special envoy to Saudi Arabia sent by King Abdullah II, during which time he was granted a Saudi passport. The Saudi insistence on Awadullah's immediate release — before any judicial process or the filing of formal charges — gives the appearance that the Saudis are worried about what he might say. The Saudi foreign ministry denied the claims and responded to the *CNN* investigation about the issue that "The minister [Prince Faisal Bin Farhan] was in Amman to confirm solidarity and support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the Kingdom of Jordan", and that "the minister did not discuss any other issues or submit any requests."
