# Al Barid Bank



**Al Barid Bank** (lit. 'Postal Bank') is a government-owned bank based in Casablanca, Morocco. It is the country's postal savings system and was licensed as a bank in 2010.


## Overview

Poste Maroc, the national post office, started offering financial services in 1926. Al Barid Bank was formed on 8 June 2010, following a three-year process of preparation, and received a full banking license later in 2010,³ even though it only serves individual customers. It remains fully owned by Poste Maroc.

Al Barid Bank has been credited with enabling significant progress towards financial inclusion in Morocco, helping to raise the share of Moroccan adults with access to banking services from 34 percent to 62 percent just between 2010 and 2014. Al Barid is also dominant in the Moroccan market for remittance services.

By 2020, Al Barid Bank had over 7 individual customers in Morocco, and by November 2022 2.3 million used its mobile services. Its financial performance has increased rapidly in the early 2020s. It has a dense network in the country, with 1900 offices and 920 ATMs as of October 2020.

Since early 2023, Mr Al-Amine Nejjar has been the chief executive (chairman of the management board) of Al Barid Bank.
