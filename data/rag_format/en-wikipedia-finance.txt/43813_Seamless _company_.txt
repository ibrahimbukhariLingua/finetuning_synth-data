# Seamless (company)



**Seamless North America LLC** (formerly **SeamlessWeb**) is an online food ordering service that allows users to order food for delivery and takeout from restaurants through their website or suite of mobile apps.


## History

Seamless was launched in 1999 by Jason Finger, Paul Appelbaum, Todd Arky and Andy Appelbaum as SeamlessWeb, providing companies with a web-based system for ordering food from restaurants and caterers. Starting in 2005, Seamless was made available to individual users and they currentlyʷʰᵉⁿ? partner with over 12,000 restaurants, serve over 4,000 companies, and have over 2,000,000 members in the United States and in London. The service is available for personal orders in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Miami, Chicago, Houston, Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and London. It was acquired by Aramark in April 2006. On June 8, 2011, Spectrum Equity Investors made a $50 million minority investment in Seamless and the company was spun out of Aramark into an independent entity.

On June 28, 2011, SeamlessWeb notified their clients they had changed their name to *Seamless*.

In May 2013, Seamless announced the signing of an agreement to merge with GrubHub, creating a combined company with a higher order volume and improved regional coverage.

On August 9, 2013, Seamless and GrubHub completed their merger and now operate under the name GrubHub, Inc. (formerly known as GrubHub Seamless). The merger resulted in connecting diners with approximately 25,000 restaurants for online and mobile-ordering across the United States and in London. In the first half of 2013, the combined organization processed approximately 130,000 orders per day.

After Grubhub was acquired by Just Eat Takeaway on June 15, 2021, Seamless' logo was updated.
