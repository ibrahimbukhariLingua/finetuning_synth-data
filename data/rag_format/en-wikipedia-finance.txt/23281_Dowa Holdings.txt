**Dowa Holdings** (DOWAホールディングス株式会社, *DOWA Hōrudingusu Kabushiki-gaisha*) is a Japanese nonferrous metals manufacturer. The company is a component of the Nikkei 225 stock index.


## History

Fujita-gumi, the forerunner of DOWA, was established by three brothers from Yamaguchi prefecture in 1881. The brothers had personal connections with influential members of the government, so in 1884 they bought the Kosaka mine, from which they expanded their business into various fields, centered on the coal mining business. After the purchase, Fujita-gumi increased its capital and invested heavily in skilled labor and equipment. By 1888, the Kosaka mine became Japan's top producer of silver.

In 1900, an engineer at Kosaka succeeded in extracting copper by accessing *kuroko* (black ore — a mixture of copper, zinc and lead) deep in the mine. After that, Kosaka changed its focus from silver to copper, and in 1907, became Japan's largest copper producer.

Dowa Mining was an early developer of Yuzawa, a hot spring town using geothermal energy, in the late 20th century.


### Post 2000s

As of April 2007, Dowa Holdings was Japan's largest silver smelter.

Dowa Holdings built a recycling plant in Kosaka which has been operating since 2008, extracting minerals and valuable metals from old electronics parts. One of its subsidiaries, Kosaka Smelting and Refining, has reclaimed rare materials including gold, indium, and antimony. In 2010, the company was working on methods to reclaim rare-earth elements, which are harder to mine, such as neodymium and dysprosium.

As of 2010, Dowa was one of the top three zinc producers in Japan. As of 2016, Dowa Holdings possessed the technology for recovering 22 metals, including germanium, ruthenium, gallium, and selenium. In 2017, Dowa Holdings was involved in recycling efforts by sorting through electronics wastes in search for gold, platinum, palladium, and additional rare metals. As of 2018, Dowa Holdings had more than 6,000 employees.

In April 2023, Mitsubishi Materials Corp took full ownership of Onahama Smelting & Refining after purchasing its stake in Dowa Holdings and Furukawa Co..

As of July 2023, Dowa Holdings was the top producer worldwide of high-purity gallium. In 2024, Dowa filed a patent for gold plating. In 2024, Dowa was granted a patent for copper plating.
