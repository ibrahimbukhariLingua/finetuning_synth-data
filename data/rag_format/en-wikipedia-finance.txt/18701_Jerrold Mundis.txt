## Early life

Mundis was born March 3, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois. He was the son of Dolores Mundis of Bethesda, Maryland, and James M. Mundis, a Kansas native and WWII Navy veteran. His father was a journalist and public relations director who worked for AT&T as its director of news and public relations before retiring in the early 1980s. Jerrold was the middle child between his two siblings, Tom Mundis and Donna Field.

Mundis attended Beloit College from 1959 through 1961. In 1963, he received a B.A. from New York University. He married and raised two sons in the Catskills before moving to Greenwich Village in New York City.


## Writing career

Mundis wrote both fiction and non-fiction, including ghostwritten books, and some 100 short stories, essays, and articles in publications such as the New York Times Magazine, Harper's Weekly and American Heritage.

Mundis is most known for his 13 books of nonfiction, particularly *How To Get Out Of Debt, Stay Out Of Debt & Live Prosperously,* *Earn what You Deserve: How to Stop Underearning & Start Thriving,* and *Making Peace With Money*.

In *Earn What You Deserve*, a book on under-earning, he provides an approach to compulsive behavior regarding spending and handling financial matters beginning with "three cardinal rules: do not incur debt, do not take work that pays less than you require and do not say 'no' to money."

Mundis also wrote 17 novels, including *Gerhardt's Children*. *The New York Times* described the novel as "a tricky narrative to bring off, involving as it does many centrifugal lives, but Mr. Mundis brings it off." He wrote under his own name as well as several pseudonyms.

Under the pseudonym Eric Corder, Mundis wrote his *Shame and Glory* saga about the American slave trade. The series included the books *Slave Ship*, *Slave*, *The Long Tattoo*, *Hell Bottom*, and *Running Dogs*. As Corder, he also wrote a non-fiction book, *Prelude to Civil War: Kansas-Missouri, 1854-61,* recounting the Bleeding Kansas affair from both the pro-slavery and free-soil points of view, beginning with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. As Julia Withers, Mundis wrote *Echo in a Dark Wind*, a neo-gothic novel published in 1966.

His novel *The Dogs,* written under the pseudonym Robert Calder, was the subject of an interview by Terry Gross on Fresh Air on May 26, 1976. Several other works by Mundis about canines include ghost-written training books about "a celebrated collie" (Lassie). He also wrote *The Dog Book*, featuring writing by Doris Lessing, E.B. White, Edward Hoagland, William Cowper, John Burroughs, and John Steinbeck.

His work also includes the drama *King of the Ice Cream Mountain*, a one-act play for children., co-written with a partner in 1968.


## Public Speaking

Mundis spoke regularly on debt and personal money for many professional societies and associations, including such organizations as the US Customs and Border Protection and the National Education Association, Unity Church. A recovered "debtor" himself, he was intimately familiar with the success of the Debtors Anonymous program.


## Recognition and awards

Mundis was a member of the Authors Guild, PEN American Center, and Poets & Writers. He was listed in Contemporary Authors and the Directory of American Poets & Fiction Writers. Some of his books were selected for The Book-of-the-Month Club, the Literary Guild, and the One Spirit Book Club.

Under his Robert Calder persona, Mundis won a Dog Writers Association of America award in 1977 for *The Dogs*. The Chicago Tribune once said of him, "One day Calder is Julia Withers, Gothic novelist the next, he's Eric Corder, black historian or Franklin W. Dixon, one of the writers who penned Hardy Boy serials. He's also Jack Lancer, creator of Chris Cool, Teen Agent."

With his focus on "gaining happier relationships with money" as a writer and public speaker, he was internationally recognized in Debtors Anonymous' 12-step Fellowship (founded in 1971) for helping others and introducing them to the recovery movement. Mundis framed the societal problem as that the “discussion of personal finances, particularly indebtedness, may be the last American taboo.” He pinpointed the issue for the individual suffering from compulsive debt saying, “admitting the problem is essential. Being willing to face facts...” with the caveat that “denial is nearly universal.”


## Death

Mundis died from complications of COVID-19 in Manhattan on April 4, 2020, at the age of 79.
