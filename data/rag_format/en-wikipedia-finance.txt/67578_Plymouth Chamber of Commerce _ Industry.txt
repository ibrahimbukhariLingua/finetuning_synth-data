## History

The Devon and Plymouth Chamber is the third oldest Chamber in the UK.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It was formed under the presidency of the first Earl of Morley originally as the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce in response to a decision made by the Government in 1813. The Government of the day initiated a 25% cutback in the Royal Navy and as a result the local business area of Devonport was hit hard. In response the civic and business leaders held an emergency meeting at Plymouth's Guildhall and, wishing to exert direct local control over the towns economic future, they formed a Chamber of Commerce.


## Present day

The Devon and Plymouth Chamber of Commerce offers services that are common for most Chambers such as membership, networking events, and training courses. It also offers an international trade service.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Chamber is involved with the Plymouth 2020 urban redevelopment, and other initiatives such as Plymouth's Better Together project, and work in preparing Plymouth to host the Americas Cup in September 2011.

The Chamber has set three main missions to help improve Plymouth and its clients. One is focused on the macroeconomics and business community of Plymouth and surrounding regions, where the aim is to help give clients a better understanding of this.ᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ

Another part of this mission is the intention to focus on growing Plymouth's business economy. The Chamber helps build clients business through a structured (but non compulsory) programme of networking and business events, a number of which are hosted and arranged by the Chamber itself.

The Chamber finally acts as a central source and conduit of crucial business information and intelligence. This usually means the Chamber has its best interest to stay ahead when it comes to being knowledgeable about the latest business affairs.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
