Mitsuwa Marketplace


# Mitsuwa Marketplace



**Mitsuwa Marketplace** (ミツワマーケットプレイス, **Mitsuwa Mākettopureisu**) is a Japanese supermarket chain in America, with locations in California, Illinois, Texas, Hawaii, and New Jersey.


## History

As a subsidiary of Yaohan, *Yaohan USA* opened its first supermarket in Fresno in 1979. During its heyday, Yaohan operated eight stores all over the States, as well as four Daikichi sushi shops.

Upon bankruptcy of Yaohan in 1997, Yaohan USA was subject to a management buyout by regional management, with rebranding as *Mitsuwa Marketplace*.

Mitsuwa continued to expand its stores, mainly inside California. In December 2012, Kamei Corporation [ja], a Japanese trading company, acquired Mitsuwa's stock.


## Store locations

The Los Angeles location of Mitsuwa Marketplace in the Little Tokyo neighborhood closed in 2009. In 2019, Torrance closed the location in Old Town Torrance and reopened within the Del Amo Fashion Center in February 2020. The former building was then demolished in 2023.

### Chicago metropolitan area

The Chicago area store is at 100 E. Algonquin Road in Arlington Heights, Illinois—one of a number of Japanese businesses in Arlington Heights—and opened in 1991. The store is open 365 days a year from 9 am to 8 pm. Mitsuwa is the largest Japanese marketplace in the Midwestern US. The Chicago store is one of three that are east of the Rockies. This Mitsuwa location, like those in other states, was formerly known as Yaohan.

The largest area of Chicago's Mitsuwa Marketplace is devoted to its grocery section. This department is home to many imported Japanese ingredients which are often hard to find in typical Chicago-area grocery stores, as well as popular Japanese drinks and snacks such as Ramune, Calpis, Pocari Sweat, Yakult, Japanese teas and coffees, Pocky, Pretz, Black Thunder and other Japanese candies, azuki bean and matcha-flavored treats, and more. There are also imported toiletries and makeup, as well as kitchen items including rice cookers, knives, cookware, chopsticks, food storage containers, and Japanese-style dishware.

The food court has many traditional foods, such as sushi, tempura, noodles, and more. It currently comprises the restaurants Santouka Ramen, specializing in ramen; Mugimaru, specializing in udon; Sutadon-Ya, specializing in beef bowls and similar; Tokyo Shokudo, specializing in Japanese cuisine; Toritetsu, specializing in yakitori; Re Leaf, specializing in matcha and café fare; B-Bee Crepe & Boba, specializing in crepes and drinks with boba; and MaMa House, specializing in Korean cuisine. Other shops within Mitsuwa that sell ready-to-eat food are Pastry House Hippo, a Japanese bakery; Mitsuwa NAGOMI, which sells sushi; Lady M, a cake shop specializing in and founded by the inventor of mille crêpes cakes; J.sweets, which sells mochi and other Japanese confectionaries; and ROYCE', which sells chocolates; however, these shops are slightly outside the main food court area itself. There is also a Japanese liquor store. Previous restaurants include Otafuku-Tei (replaced by Gabutto Burger), Gabutto Burger (replaced by Sutadon-Ya), Kayaba (replaced by Mugimaru), Jockey Express (replaced by Tokyo Shokudo), and Daikichi Sushi (replaced by several shops due to minor remodel, but primarily Toritetsu).

Mitsuwa Chicago hosts a Kinokuniya, a Japanese book shop that sells manga, anime figurines, video game artbooks, Gunpla, stationery, novels, and other imported Japanese media and merchandise. This location was once also home to the JTB travel agency, JBC Video (a Japanese video rental store), Galaxy Wireless (a cell phone store), and Utsuwa no Yakata (a Japanese china store which closed on April 1, 2006).

The Chicago location also hosts Aruka's Hair Resort, a hair salon which uses an outside entrance. Mitsuwa Chicago previously had other now-closed personal care shops, such as Shiseido, a Japanese cosmetics store, and Super Health, a vitamin and other health supplement store.


### New Jersey

The Edgewater, New Jersey store is located on 595 River Road. It has a food court, a bookstore owned by Kinokuniya, a gift shop selling Bape clothing and golf clubs, a video store that carries DVDs and Laserdiscs of movies and a store selling Japanese ceramics and denki-gama, making Mitsuwa more of a mini-mall than a traditional supermarket. It is a small taste of what current Japanese multi-story malls, or subway stations, are like.

The supermarket section sells fresh produce and certified Angus beef, as well as Japanese drinks and snacks such as Yakult, Calpis, Ramune, Ikechi Shrimp Chips, Pocari Sweat, Pocky, Pretz, and Japanese liquor such as Sake and Shōchū.

The Books Kinokuniya bookstore section sells Japanese music CDs, novels, job applications, children's books, manga, and imported magazines (including dozens of Japanese fashion magazines) such as Weekly Shonen Jump and Disney Fan.

There is also a kiosk that sells Ito En tea and Minamoto Kitchoan that sells Japanese sweets such as manju, mochi, and Inja.

A Daiso "100-yen shop" location opened at the marketplace in August 2019.

The New Jersey location used to run an exclusive shuttle bus between the store and the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City. The bus transported Mitsuwa customers for a nominal fee and it did not make any stops along its route. The service was terminated on December 31, 2014.
