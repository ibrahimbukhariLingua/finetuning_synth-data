# Institute of Management Foundation



The **Institute of Management Foundation** (known as FIA) is a higher education institution founded in 1980 by professors and collaborators from the School of Economics, Business and Accounting of the University of São Paulo (FEA-USP).

FIA works closely with FEA-USP in training students as well as in raising funds for FEA-USP by providing consulting services to corporations and government institutions.

FIA international MBA is currently ranked among the TOP 100 universities in the world according to QS university rankings.


## Undergraduate Controversy

FIA also offers an undergraduate degree in business administration, which has generated criticism from students, faculty and staff at the University of São Paulo (USP) as this is the first time a University of São Paulo–related entity offers a private undergraduate degree, while the University of São Paulo (USP) is a public institution owned by the state of São Paulo.

To respond the criticizes from the university of São Paulo, James Wright, ex-director of FIA and professor of FEA-USP says that the undergrad program of FIA is a “laboratory experiment” comparing with undergrad students from FEA-USP


## International University Partnerships

**University of Cambridge - King's College**

FIA has collaborations with University of Cambridge regarding the hiring of teachers to participate in their joint partnerships

Since then, the same teachers have been hired directly by the FIA and selected by our Coordination. In the past, about 50% of classes were taught at Colleges and 50% in the auditorium of the Judge Institute.

Since 2013 we have a contract with King's College to carry out classes, and the corresponding certificate is issued by the FIA.'
