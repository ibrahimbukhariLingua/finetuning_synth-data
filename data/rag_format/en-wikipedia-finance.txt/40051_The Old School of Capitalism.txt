The Old School of Capitalism


# The Old School of Capitalism



***The Old School of Capitalism*** (Serbo-Croatian: *Stara škola kapitalizma*) is a 2009 feature film directed by Serbian director Želimir Žilnik.


## Plot

The film is mixture of documentary and fiction examining the new *god* of capitalism offered to the Serbs with the ending of state socialism. The story's background are a number of strikes in Belgrade during the late 2000s and these introduce us to a number of characters who play themselves. Explosive situations result with employees dressed in American football helmets and pads square up with employers' heavies in their bullet-proof vests.

A visit from the Russian tycoon's representative and vice president Joe Biden's arrival complicate the proceedings further.


## Reception

The Rotterdam Film Festival's review argues that it is an "intriguing docu-drama observes with x-ray eyes and in a sharp tone what's going on in the new Serbia. No lazy ideological analysis, but a complex and yet lighthearted portrait of the consequences of globalised capitalism for a country that has only just joined in the game."
