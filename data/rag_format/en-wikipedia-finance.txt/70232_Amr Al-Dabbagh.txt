## Corruption allegations

In November 2017, Al-Dabbagh was detained as part of what was called a wide-ranging "anti-corruption" purge that also ensnared Saudi Princes Alwaleed bin Talal and Miteb bin Abdullah.

On November 4, it was claimed that Dabbagh was called from Jeddah to the Ritz Carlton, a luxurious Riyadh hotel that had been converted into a makeshift prison for hundreds of Saudis suspected of corruption by the authorities, and was detained together with other prominent Saudi officials and businessmen.

Along with Dabbagh, Adel Fakeih, the former economy minister of the country, and Hani Khoja, were kept in custody.

Dabbagh continued to deny the charges against him. Until 20 December 2018, there was no specific charges against Al-Dabbagh, or any legal proceedings. He was released without charge on 23 January 2019.
