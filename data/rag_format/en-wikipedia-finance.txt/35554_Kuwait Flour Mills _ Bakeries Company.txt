## History

Soon after the state's independence, the Kuwaiti government quickly commenced its program of industrialization, creating a number of new companies under its control. One of these was the Kuwait Flour Mills Company. Incorporated in 1961, the company focused on specialized food products and familiarized them to the market. In 1969, the company launched a factory for the production of macaroni and in 1970 a factory for the production of biscuits. KFMB commissioned a vegetable oil factory in 1976, a first of its nature in the Persian Gulf region. Beginning in 1978, the company took steps to build additional bakeries, all geographically situated in Kuwait, which was considered an industrial milestone in the Persian Gulf area at that point in time.

In 1988, ‘Kuwait Flour Mills Company’ was merged with ‘Kuwait Bakeries Company’ and attained its new identity as “Kuwait Flour Mills & Bakeries Company”. In 1994, KFMB took over the government-run ‘Kuwait Supply Company’, which provided and delivered food supply and construction materials. These products were subsidized by the government in accordance with the policies and resolutions of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The company currently offers a full range of flours, including specialized flours used in the production of Arabic bread types, as well as processed flours used in European bread.

In compliance with the company’s mission to achieve food security, the company established the Animal Feed Plant in 1996 for the production of animal feed enriched with nutritional values to serve the livestock that is one of the integral elements for nutrition in the country.
