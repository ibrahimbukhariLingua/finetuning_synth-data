Premier Tobacco became a listed company on the Karachi Stock Exchange in 1955. In 1984, Samad sold his controlling stake to Sadruddin Hashwani of Hashoo Group, which was ultimately acquired by Lakhani family from Hashwani in 1987.

In 2007, Philip Morris International increased its shareholding in the company to 97 percent and renamed it as Philip Morris Pakistan.
