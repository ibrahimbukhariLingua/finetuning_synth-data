## History


### 19th and 20th centuries

In May 1898, the Cantonal Parliament of St. Gallen established an academy for trade, commerce and administration in St. Gallen. The actual founding father is considered to be Theodor Curti, then the head of the Department of Economic Affairs of the Canton of St. Gallen. The business academy commenced lectures in 1899, making it one of the first institutions of its kind in the world. From 1911 onward, the name *Handels-Hochschule* was used. In 1938, the former foundation under private law became a public institution, and in 1939 gained the right to award doctoral degrees.

In 1963, the university moved to new buildings and changed its name to *Hochschule für Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften*. The new buildings were planned for 900 students, but by the winter term of 1963/64, more than 1150 students were enrolled. With the enaction of the Higher Education Act of 1989, the university was renamed *Hochschule St. Gallen für Wirtschafts-, Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaften* to reflect its curricula. The university has had its law department since 1978. In 1989, the library building opened, and enrollment had grown to over 3900. In February 1994, the Cantonal Parliament of St. Gallen approved a bill to amend the Higher Education Act, leading to the renaming of the institution as *Universität St. Gallen* (University of St. Gallen). The acronym *HSG* remained.


### Recent history

In the winter of 2001/02, the University of St. Gallen started the reorganization of its study programs. Education was classified into bachelor's and master's degrees, making the university Switzerland's pioneer in the Bologna process. In October 2005, the university's Executive School of Management, Technology and Law (ES-HSG) was opened. The financially autonomous Executive School centralizes further educational activities such as MBA and executive MBA programs.

Mid-2005, the people of St. Gallen voted (with 66.4% in favour) to renovate, reorganize and expand the university by 2011. With a budget of about 80m Swiss francs, buildings from the 1960s were renovated, and its infrastructure was updated.


## Campus

The University of St. Gallen is located atop Rosenberg Hill, overlooking the Altstadt of St. Gallen, with a view of the Alpstein mountain range. The campus is noted for its integration of art and architecture. The area around the university, including the town of St. Gallen at Lake Constance and the Alps, offers facilities for outdoor activities including skiing, hiking, climbing and sailing.

In the Main Building, designed by Walter Foerderer and regarded worldwide as a significant example of 1960s architecture, art is a major feature of the architecture; whereas in the Library Building of 1989, works of art complement the diversity of architectural forms narratively. There are works by Kemény, Penalba, Arp, Braque, Hajdu, Soniatta, Miró, Calder, Soulages, Giacometti, Tàpies, Coghuf, Otto Müller, Disler, Bill, Josef Felix Müller, Paladino, Richter, and Cucchi.

In 1995, a convention and executive education centre opened a few minutes walk from the main campus. Extended in 2007, it now comprises several plenary halls and 54 business rooms. The university also has international hubs in Singapore and São Paulo to connect local faculty, students, alumni and companies with its academic activities.

In 2019, the voters of the canton of St. Gallen approved the construction of an additional campus in the city. The new campus will create room for 3,000 additional students and will be opened in 2027.

In February 2022, the new HSG Learning Center "SQUARE" opened on the Rosenberg. It is intended to be an innovative place for thinking and working, enabling new types of learning and interaction between students, faculty and people from the field. The project is being realised by the HSG Foundation and financed entirely through donations. Over 800 donors have supported the HSG Learning Center to date. The project "Open Grid - Choices of Tomorrow" by Sou Fujimoto Architects won the architecture competition in 2018.


## Academics


### Schools, institutes, and research centres

Following a restructuring in 2011, there are five schools at the University of St. Gallen: the School of Management (SoM-HSG), the School of Finance (SoF-HSG), the Law School (LS-HSG), the School of Economics and Political Science (SEPS-HSG), and the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (SHSS-HSG). Study programs are typically associated with a specific school but are taught jointly by faculty members from several schools. The Executive School of Management, Technology and Law (ES-HSG) plays a special role which has the status of an *Institut mit besonderen gesamtuniversitären Aufgaben* and which runs the MBA and executive education programs.

The crystallization points of research at the University of St. Gallen are about 40 institutes and research centres, which are an integral part of the university. The directors of the institutes double as professors of the University of St. Gallen. Bringing theory and practice together, the institutes provide important input for teaching at the university and play a significant role in furthering the careers of young academics. 80 tenured professors, 60 assistant professors and senior lecturers, and more than 300 lecturers and 300 assistants, plus distinguished visiting professors cultivate the scientific discourse with the students.

The University of St. Gallen is a member of the European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS) and the Auto-ID Labs network.


### Study programmes

A new structure of Studies became operational as of winter 2001/2002. Degrees are now divided into Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral programmes under the Bologna Process. Since 2013, the bachelor's degree programmes have started with an Assessment Year for all students. The Assessment Year in Economics and Law is offered in two separate tracks, with instruction in either German or English. The main difference between the two is that the English track offers an economics specialization that allows for subsequent Bachelor studies in Business Administration, Economics, International Affairs, or Law and Economics. The German track offers an additional option of a specialization in Law for students interested in pursuing Bachelor studies in Law. Many Master's programmes and most Doctoral programmes are taught in English.

Upon successful completion of the Assessment Year, students can then choose one of five majors for their remaining years of study as listed below. It is worth noting that the degrees are very flexible and most students take more than three years to finish their bachelor's degree. The majority of Bachelor students are enrolled in Business Administration. Aside from the University of St. Gallen, only the University of Geneva offers an International Affairs programme within Switzerland. The Master's programmes cover the same range of studies but are more specialised. The Master's programmes typically run from 1.5 to 2 years. Besides the CEMS Master's in International Management, further double degrees may be obtained in cooperation with partner universities such as Bocconi University, ESADE, HEC Paris, INCAE Business School, Nanyang Technological University, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Rotterdam School of Management, or Sciences Po Paris.

In 2021, a professor at the University of St. Gallen ended her supervisor agreement with a temporarily deregistered doctorate student and had the university delete his email account, for making a negative comment on Twitter about China's communication during the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis.
