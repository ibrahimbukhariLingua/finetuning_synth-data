**Exonumia** are numismatic items (such as tokens, medals, or scrip) other than coins and paper money. This includes "Good For" tokens, badges, counterstamped coins, elongated coins, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, wooden nickels and other similar items. It is an aspect of numismatics and many coin collectors are also exonumists.

Besides the above strict definition, others extend it to include non-coins which may or may not be legal tenders such as cheques, credit cards and similar paper. These can also be considered notaphily or scripophily.


## Etymology

The noun *exonumia* is derived from two classical roots: *exo*, meaning "out-of" in Greek, and *nummus*, meaning "coin" in Latin (from Greek νοῦμμος – *noummos*, "coin"); thus, "out[side]-of-[the category]coins". The equivalent British term, **paranumismatica**, may also be used.

The words *exonumist* and *exonumia* were coined in July 1960 by Russell Rulau, a recognized authority and author on the subject, and accepted by Webster's dictionary in 1965.


## Token coins

Many tokens were produced and used as currency in the United States and elsewhere when there was a shortage of government-issued money. Tokens have been used for both to advertise and to facilitate commerce and may or may not have a value.

Token authority Russell Rulau offers a broad definition for exonumia in his 1040 page tome, *UNITED STATES TOKENS: 1700–1900* but lines between categories can be fuzzy. For example, an advertising token may also be considered a medal. **Good For** tokens may also advertise. Counter-stamped coins have been called "little billboards."

One way of parsing tokens is into these three general categories:

* Has a "value," facilitating commerce, such as *Good for (something)*.
* Commemoration, remembrance, dedication, or the like, for some person, place, idea or event.
* Of a *personal nature*.

Typically, catalogs of tokens are organized by location, time period, and/or type of item. Historically, the need for tokens grew out of the need for currency. In America, some tokens legally circulated alongside or instead of currency. Hard Times Tokens and Civil War tokens each were the size of the contemporary cent. Afterwards, value based items, such as *Good for (amount of money)*, *Good for One Quart of Milk*, *Good for One Beer*, *Good for One Ride…* and others were specifically linked to commerce of the store or place of issue.


## Medals

Medals are coin-like artistic objects, typically with a commemorative purpose. They may be awarded for recognition of achievement or created for sale to commemorate individuals or events. They may be souvenirs, devotional, or purely artistic. Medals are generally not used as currency or for exchange.


## Exonumia collecting

Exonumia collectors, like coin collectors, are attentive to condition and rarity, as well as to history, form and type. Exonumists may collect items by region, topic, type, shape or material and this affects the ways tokens are documented.

The following categories are typical. This is not all-inclusive but is a sampling of the wide variety of exonumia.

#### Germany

Notgeld, primarily in the form of paper banknotes, was issued in Germany and Austria during World War I and the interwar period by towns, banks and other institutions due to a shortage of money.


#### Latin America

Latin American coffee or plantation tokens were an important part of commerce. Many plantation owners had their own commissaries and workers used plantation tokens to pay for provisions. Many tokens were made in the United States or Europe. Plantation tokens had an array of denominations and names. The name can be the owner, their relatives or the name of the farm (or finca). Tokens had allegorical symbols to identify the owner. Tokens were used as currency when there was not enough official currency available. Workers could convert the tokens to official currency on Saturdays.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Tokens were made in all types of base metals and alloys plus plastic, celluloid and bakelite. Unique to Costa Rica were tokens made of paper (paper chits). The word "boleto" is used in Costa Rica for the word token whereas "ficha" is used in the rest of Latin America.


#### United Kingdom

Conder tokens were privately minted tokens
from the later part of the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century in England, Anglesey and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.


#### United States

Rulau breaks down American tokens into these general time periods:

* Early American
* Hard times tokens were made during the "hard times" after President Andrew Jackson shut down the Second Bank of the United States. These tokens were issued privately to circulate in the local economy as a one cent coin. They had a wide variety of subject matter, including advertising and political/satirical themes (anti-slavery, anti-Jackson).
* Civil War tokens were made between 1861 and 1864 due to the scarcity of government-issued cents during the American Civil War. Encased postage stamps were also used for this purpose.
* Merchant (including modern gas tokens, ex: Shell tokens)

* Trade tokens
* Gay 90s
