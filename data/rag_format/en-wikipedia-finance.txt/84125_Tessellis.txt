**Tessellis S.p.A.** (formerly **Tiscali S.p.A.**) is an Italian telecommunications company founded in 1998 and based in Cagliari, Sardinia, that provides Internet and telecommunications services in Italy, and, previously had operations in other European nations through its acquisition of many smaller European Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the late 1990s.

Since 2022, following the Tiscali-Linkem merger, the company has acquired full control of the retail services previously provided by Linkem (now OpNet), including the brand.


## History

Tiscali S.p.A. was created in January 1998 in Cagliari by Renato Soru, following the deregulation of Italian telephone system. The company owes its name to a Sardinian mountain at which remains of an ancient village were found.

In 1999 the subsidiary Tiscali Italia S.p.A. was founded.

From March 1999 onward, Tiscali offered "Tiscali Free Net", a subscription-free Internet service where customers only had to pay for the time they were online. This pushed other Italian providers to repeal their fixed subscription fees, thus contributing to making the Internet accessible to the masses in Italy.

In November 1999 Tiscali, Franco Bernabè and Sanpaolo IMI founded Andala, which in 2000 was acquired by Hutchison Whampoa and won the tender for the award of 3G (UMTS) licenses.

On 25 March 2009 Tiscali launches Tiscali Mobile, an ESP MVNO on the TIM network.

In 2012 three subsidiaries were founded:

* Veesible S.r.l.: dealer for the sale of advertising space;
* indoona S.r.l.: company aimed at developing the IM application of the same name;
* istella S.r.l.: company aimed at developing the search engine of the same name.

On 30 December 2021, Tiscali S.p.A. and Linkem S.p.A. approved the project for the merger by incorporation of Linkem Retail S.r.l. in Tiscali S.p.A.

On 27 April 2022, the shareholders' meetings of Tiscali and Linkem approved the merger between the two companies.

On 1 August 2022, the two companies completed the merger process: Tiscali S.p.A. integrated Linkem Retail S.r.l., with the consequent transfer of the branch to the subsidiary Tiscali Italia S.p.A., while Linkem S.p.A. (now OpNet S.p.A.) became the majority shareholder of Tiscali S.p.A. (58.60%).

After announcing it in October 2022, on 19 January 2023 the name of the parent company became Tessellis S.p.A., which will continue to operate under both the commercial brands Tiscali and Linkem.

On February 2, 2024, Wind Tre signed an agreement for the acquisition of the assets, including the network infrastructure, of OpNet, which will be acquired 100% by Wind Tre together with all other subsidiaries, excluding Tessellis. On August 1, the transaction was completed.


### IPO

In October 1999 (during the dot-com bubble), the company went through an initial public offering (IPO) to be traded on the Italian Stock Exchange at a share price of 46 Euros. 3,098,000 shares were offered to investors of which 2,658,000 shares were created through a capital increase and the rest were sold by Soru. Soru made 20,240,000 Euros on the IPO. In 2012, the price per share had plummeted to 0.04 Euros.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
