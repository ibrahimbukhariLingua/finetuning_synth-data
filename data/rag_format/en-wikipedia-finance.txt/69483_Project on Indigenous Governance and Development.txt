Project on Indigenous Governance and Development


# Project on Indigenous Governance and Development



The **Project on Indigenous Governance and Development,** previously named the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development, also known as the **Harvard Project**, was founded in 1987 at Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University. It administers tribal awards programs as well as provides support for students and conducting research. The Harvard Project aims to understand and foster the conditions under which sustained, self-determined social and economic development is achieved among American Indian nations through applied research and service.


## Overview of the Harvard Project

Founded by Professors Stephen Cornell and Joseph P. Kalt at Harvard University in 1987, the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development (Harvard Project) is housed within the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University. The Harvard Project aims to promote research to understand and foster the conditions under which sustained, self-determined social and economic development is achieved among the American Indian nations. The Harvard Project's core activities include research, education, and the administration of a tribal governance awards program. In all of its activities, the Harvard Project collaborates with the Native Nations Institute for Leadership, Management, and Policy at the University of Arizona. The Harvard Project is also formally affiliated with the Harvard University Native American Program.

At the heart of the Harvard Project is the systematic, comparative study of social and economic development on American Indian reservations. The study made several findings of what approaches lead to improved socio-economic conditions in American Indian nations. The study found that when Native nations make their own decisions about what development approaches to take, external decision-makers on matters as diverse as governmental form, natural resource management, economic development, health care, and social service provision. The study found that for development to take hold, assertions of sovereignty must be backed by capable institutions of governance. Nations do this as they adopt stable decision rules, establish fair and independent mechanisms for dispute resolution, and separate politics from day-to-day business and program management.

Indigenous societies are diverse; each nation must equip itself with a governing structure, economic system, policies, and procedures that fit its own contemporary culture. Nation-building requires leaders who introduce new knowledge and experiences, challenge assumptions, and propose change. Such leaders, whether elected, community, or spiritual, convince people that things can be different and inspire them to take action.


## Honoring Nations

The Harvard Project also administers *Honoring Contributions in the Governance of American Indian Nations*, a national awards program that identifies, documents, and shares outstanding examples of tribal government problem-solving. This expands the capacities of Native nation-builders by enabling them to learn from each other's successes. The high public visibility and news coverage of Honoring Nations also permits Non-native policymakers, the media, and the general public to see what Native nations are actually doing in the drive for self-determination. Established in 1998, Honoring Nations’ experiences are the foundation for the teaching, advising, and policy analysis from the partnership between the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development and the Native Nations Institute at the University of Arizona.

At the heart of Honoring Nations is the principle that tribes themselves hold the key to positive social, political, cultural, and economic prosperity—and that self-governance plays a crucial role in preserving and sustaining strong, healthy Indian nations. Its programs offer knowledge and inspiration that are utilized by non-indigenous communities.

Honoring Nations invites applications from American Indian governments across a broad range of subject areas: education; health care; resource management; government policy development and reform; justice; intergovernmental relations; and economic, social, and cultural programs. A Board of Governors composed of distinguished individuals from the public, private, and nonprofit sectors guides the evaluation process, in which up to ten programs are selected for “High Honors” or “Honors.” All honorees receive national recognition. At each stage of the selection process, programs are evaluated on the basis of effectiveness, significance to sovereignty, cultural relevance, transferability, and sustainability. To facilitate the dissemination of best practices, honorees receive financial awards to share their success stories with other governments. The Harvard Project also produces reports, case studies, and other curricular materials that are disseminated to tribal leaders, public servants, the media, scholars, students, and others interested in promoting and fostering excellence in governance.

To date, Honoring Nations has recognized 142 exemplary tribal government programs, practices, and initiatives and held five tribal government symposia.
