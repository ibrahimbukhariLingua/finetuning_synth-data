Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance


# Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance



**Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance** (Russian: *Санкт-Петербургский государственный университет экономики и финансов*) was a public university in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was established in 1930 as *Leningrad Institute of Finance and Economics* (*Ленинградский финансово-экономический институт*; hence the colloquial name *Финэк* (Finec)). In 2012, it united with Saint Petersburg State University of Service and Economics and Saint Petersburg State University of Engineering and Economics to create Saint Petersburg State University of Economics. The campus of the university occupied the buildings of the former Russian Assignation Bank.


## History

Leningrad Institute of Finance and Economics (LFEI) was created on the basis of the restructured economic faculty of Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute on 3 June 1930. LFEI was enlarged several times, by merging first with the Moscow Institute of Finance and Economics in 1934, then with Higher Institute of Finance and Economics (Leningrad) and Financial Academy (Leningrad) in 1940.

During World War II the institute was evacuated to Essentuki before being evacuated to Tashkent. Finec renewed its operations in Leningrad on 1 September 1944.

In 1954, LFEI was merged with Leningrad Planning Institute. In 1963, it was named after Russian economist and politician Nikolai Voznesensky. From 1966 to 1991, Yuri Lavrikov [ru] was a rector of the institute.

On 23 September 1991, by the decree of the Council of Ministers of RSFSR, N.A. Voznesenski Leningrad Institute of Economics and Finance was renamed *Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance*, its current name. During the post-Soviet years, the university established itself among the leaders of the Russian economic schools, being the first in the official ratings of the Russian Ministry of Education for more than a decade. In October 1991, Leonid Tarasevich [ru] has become the rector of the university. In December 2006, Igor Maksimtsev [ru] was elected as the new rector.

At present the university enrolls about 13,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students, who are given instruction at 11 faculties and 40 departments.


### Campus

The campus, being urban, has its buildings scattered around the city. There are three dormitories (halls of residence) owned by the university in several areas. One is situated at Park Pobedy metro station, so it takes about 30–40 minutes to get to university from there. Another university dorm is located at Ladozhskaya metro station. Then there is a dormitory right in the university yard. However, it is being rebuilt now for the use as auditoria.

In 2015, they open a branch in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. **Saint Petersburg State Economic University (Dubai branch)** is located in Armada Tower at Jumeirah Lake Towers (JLT), Cluster P.
