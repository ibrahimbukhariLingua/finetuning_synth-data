# Primondo



**Primondo** is the holding company for all mail order brands of Arcandor AG.

The mail order line of Arcandor AG (previously KarstadtQuelle AG) has been called “Primondo” since 1 March 2007. Primondo itself is a holding company, which does not appear as a brand for the end customer. Primondo is rather a house of brands in the universal and specialist mail order business. Well-known examples are Quelle, Hess Natur, Bogner Homeshopping or Baby Walz. Since June 2007, the teleshopping channel HSE24 has also been part of the Primondo Group. More than 23,000 employees work for Primondo in 23 different countries. On June 9, 2009 the company filed for bankruptcy.
