## History

The Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research was founded on July 1, 1997, as the “Global Foundation for Research and Scholarship” with donations from the Japanese Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (now the Nippon Foundation) and Japan’s boat-racing industry following authorization by the Minister of Transport (now the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, and Tourism).

Nippon Foundation Chairman Yōhei Sasakawa serves as adviser to the president. Additional sources of its endowment at the time of its founding included 3 billion yen from the Ship and Ocean Foundation (now part of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation) and 8 billion yen from the Sasakawa Peace Foundation.

It was renamed the “Tokyo Foundation” in May 1999; became a public interest incorporated foundation on April 1, 2010, upon authorization by the Cabinet Office; and adopted its current name, “The Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research,” in February 2018 as part of its reorganization into a more research-intensive institute for evidenced-based, theoretically informed policy studies.

Notable scholars like Gerald Curtis and Katsuhito Iwai, senior fellows when the organization was known as the Tokyo Foundation, are still associated with the think tank as distinguished fellows.


## Activities

Its activities during the years as the Toyo Foundation centered on three domains, as expressed in its tagline: (1) Developing People, (2) Investing in People, and (3) Transforming Society. Since its restructuring following its twentieth anniversary, the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research has aimed to become a public policy think tank that (1) conducts rigorous, high-quality research, (2) pursues its activities from an independent and not-for-profit viewpoint, and (3) changes society for the better by offering a broad range of policy options. Its leadership development initiatives are focused on developing “socially engaged leaders with outstanding academic credentials who are capable of transcending differences in an increasingly divisive world.”
