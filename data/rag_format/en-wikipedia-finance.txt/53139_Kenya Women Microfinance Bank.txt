**Kenya Women Microfinance Bank**, formerly **Kenya Women Finance Trust** or **KWFT**, is a deposit-taking microfinance bank in Kenya, the largest economy in the East African Community.


## Overview

KWFT is a medium-tier financial services provider in Kenya. As of December 2013ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, it was the largest deposit-taking microfinance bank in the country, with an asset base valued at about US$220 million (KES:21.75 billion).

## History

The company was established in 2008, as Kenya Women Finance Trust (KWFT), a 100% subsidiary Kenya Women's Holding (KWH). In 2010, the institution was authorized to accept customer deposits, thereby becoming a deposit-taking microfinance institution. It changed its name to Kenya Women Microfinance Bank and became regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). In order to comply with CBK regulations, KWH began to sell shareholding to the KWFT Board, staff, and foreign institutions. In July 2015 it sold 25% equity to 60,974 KWFT members, thereby reducing its own shareholding to the required 25% maximum.
