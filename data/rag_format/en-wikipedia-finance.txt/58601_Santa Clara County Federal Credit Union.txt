**Santa Clara County Federal Credit Union**, also known as **County Federal**, is a credit union which offers membership to both employees and retirees of certain Santa Clara County, California, businesses, as well as their relatives. Like other United States credit unions, it is a non-profit organization founded for the purpose of providing service to its members and is funded by its members.


## Services

SCCFCU provides many products and services to its members, including loans, savings, discounts, and checking. Also, due to its non-profit nature, it can usually provide an average lower loan interest rate and higher savings interest rate than most for-profit organizations because any profit made is used for the benefit of its members rather than kept.


## Membership

County Federal serves people employed by their corporate partners in Santa Clara County, California, as it did in the past, and also employees of their corporate partners in San Benito County. Some of their most notable corporate partners include Santa Clara County Office of Education, Valley Medical Center, and the state of California. Membership is also available to the spouses, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, step-siblings, stepchildren, legal adoptees, and legal adopters of current and retired members. Other persons living with and maintaining a single economic unit with active and former members are also eligible, subject to verification.
