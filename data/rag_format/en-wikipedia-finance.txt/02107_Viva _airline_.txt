# Viva (airline)



**Aeroenlaces Nacionales, S.A. de C.V.**, trading as **Viva** (formerly **Viva Aerobus**), is a major Mexican low-cost airline headquartered at Monterrey International Airport, in Apodaca, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Measured by passenger numbers, it is Mexico´s third-largest airline and eleventh-largest airline in North America, offering more than 160 routes in more than 50 destinations serving Mexico, the United States, Central and South America.

Viva is fully owned by the largest bus company group in Mexico, IAMSA, and was co-founded by and invested in by Irelandia Aviation.

Viva operates mostly within a combination of point-to-point system with direct flights between middle-size airports and a hub system. Monterrey International Airport serves as its largest hub in terms of passengers carried and the number of departures. Cancun, Guadalajara, Mexico City-Benito Juarez, Los Cabos, Merida, Mexico City-Felipe Angeles and Tijuana serve as operating bases.


## History

The airline, launched as Viva Aerobus, commenced operations on November 30, 2006, with its hub at Monterrey International Airport, in Monterrey, Mexico, and with an initial investment of $50 million and two Boeing 737-300 aircraft. Viva Aerobus was co-owned by Ryanair's Irelandia Aviation and the Mexican bus company IAMSA. Ryanair joined with Alexander Maurice Mason of Kite Investments to establish "RyanMex" to facilitate the Irish family's investment in the Mexican airline. IAMSA has showed interest in developing a new stage of transportation after its successful bus market in Mexico, and Irelandia has been actively investigating the market opportunity, leading to the companies' partnership to form a Mexican low-cost carrier. Irelandia held a 49 percent of shares in the airline, while IAMSA had the remaining majority stake.

The airline initially connected Monterrey to a number of Mexican domestic locations and, in July 2007, publicly confirmed its intention to open its first base outside of Mexico and first US destination in Austin, Texas (although it ultimately pulled out of Austin in 2009).

Viva Aerobus fares were intended to undercut traditional Mexican carriers by up to 50 percent, in a change of the industry that started with the arrival of the country's second generation of low-cost airlines (Avolar, MexicanaClick, Interjet, Volaris) and the privatization of Mexicana de Aviación, one of the two top national airlines. The airline started operations at Monterrey International Airport in November 2006 with two aircraft and one nonstop service connecting Monterrey to Tijuana, under the leadership of Mike Szucs as its CEO. A year after its foundation, in October 2007, Viva Aerobus had already transported one million passengers. Later, Donald Rogers became Viva Aerobus CEO in May 2009, year when Guadalajara became the airline's second base. In June 2010 the airline's leadership was assigned to Juan Carlos Zuazua, current CEO . Expansion continued and the airline established Mexico City, Cancun, Tijuana and Mérida as its new bases in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2022, respectively.

On November 5, 2007, the airline received approval from the US Department of Transportation to operate to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, initially serving the Mexican destinations of Cancún, Monterrey, Guadalajara and León. Flights to the South Terminal Austin began on May 1, 2008.

On May 16, 2009, Viva Aerobus stated it would cease passenger operations at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on May 31, 2009. The airline blamed the pullout in part on an outbreak of swine flu, which caused an unprecedented decrease in demand for service. The company began to fly between Monterrey and Las Vegas in the summer of 2009.

In November 2009, the airline announced it had applied to commence operations between Hermosillo and Las Vegas beginning in March 2010.

In April 2010, the airline finally began serving Mexico's capital with two flights, one from Monterrey and the other from Guadalajara. It also started serving Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. However, the airline planned to serve Houston Hobby Airport on completion of that airport's new terminal in 2015.

In 2010, the airline opened a focus city at Mexico City International Airport on October 1 after Mexicana ceased operations. Viva Aerobus switched Mexico City from focus city into a hub on April 1, 2011, beginning more destinations from the airport.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ

On July 26, 2011, the airline received approval to fly to Chicago-Midway International Airport. On August 15 the same year, Viva Aerobus announced it would begin round-trip service between San Antonio (SAT) and Monterrey (MTY), Mexico starting that November. On April 13, 2012, the airline ceased flights to Chicago Midway. On December 7, 2019, the airline resumed flying from Monterrey to Chicago, but this time via O'Hare International Airport. In addition, the airline flew to Morelia, Guadalajara, Leon and Zacatecas from Chicago-O'Hare for the 2019-2020 winter season.

In October 2013, Viva Aerobus has signed an agreement to order 52 Airbus A320 aircraft for $5.1 billion, making it the largest order by a Latin American carrier.

On May 15, 2014, Viva Aerobus received and started using Airbus A320s. It continued using Boeing 737s until the end of 2016, when it began operating an all Airbus fleet.

In October 2014, Viva Aerobus began nonstop flights from Ciudad Juárez (Chihuahua State) to Mexico City, León, and Hermosillo. In 2015, the airline launched flights to Dallas–Fort Worth from several Mexican cities. The service was terminated in October 2015.

As of December 8, 2016, IAMSA has acquired a 100 percent stake of the company after Irelandia Aviation sold its 49% stake to the company following regulatory approval.

On December 17, 2017, Viva Aerobus began non-stop service to Los Angeles International Airport from Guadalajara International Airport.

In 2018, Viva Aerobus began non-stop service to Las Vegas and New York City from Mexico City International Airport.

Viva Aerobus announced the launch of its cargo subsidiary, Viva Cargo, in January 2020.

In late-October 2021, Viva Aerobus has announced an interline agreement with Viva Air Colombia which took effect on November 1, 2021.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2021, Viva Aerobus has partnered with Allegiant Air to form an alliance and expand low-budget services between the United States and Mexico. Subject to regulatory approval, the alliance is planned to launch in 2023.

In early August 2022, Viva Aerobus announced a codeshare agreement with Iberia to better connect passengers going between Mexico and Spain.

In September 2024, Viva Aerobus and Air Canada announced an interline agreement.

In October 2024, the airline has underwent a major rebranding as simply "Viva", and introduced a new "Flex-Sí-bilidad" policy for a more relaxed experience for passengers, which include improved ticket, name, and flight changes. Alongside, a new logo and livery was introduced.
