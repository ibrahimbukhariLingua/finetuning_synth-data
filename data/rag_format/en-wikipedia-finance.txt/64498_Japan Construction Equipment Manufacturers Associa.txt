Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association


# Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association



The **Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association** (一般社団法人 日本建設機械工業会, *Ippan Shadanhōjin Nihon Kensetsu Kikai Kōgyō-kai*), or **CEMA**, is a trade association which represents construction equipment manufacturers in Japan.
The association often responds to inquiries from media and researchers on the state of the manufacturing business environment in Japan.


## Founding

The association was formed in a time when the industry was in a massive price war. The future members of the association realized that if the war went on no one would make a profit and the companies would hurt each other. Once the industry formed its group, every company felt secure again.
