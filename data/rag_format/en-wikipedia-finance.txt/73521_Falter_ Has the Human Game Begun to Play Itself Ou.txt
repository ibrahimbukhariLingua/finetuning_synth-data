Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?


# Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?



***Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?*** is a book by American author Bill McKibben. He argues that the human game is risking playing itself out because of "leverage", or the scale of change to the planet that humans are causing. The book is largely about climate change, but also includes some discussion of unregulated artificial intelligence and bioengineering, two other modern developments that in the author's view pose significant risks to humanity. The book received mostly positive reviews.


## Background

In a 2019 interview with Murtaza Hussain of *The Intercept*, McKibben claimed that at merely one degree Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels, "[it] is already becoming difficult to live in large parts of the planet. On our current trajectory, we are headed for 3 or 4 degrees of warming. At that level, we simply won't have a civilization like we do now."

With regards to the solutions, McKibben argued in 2019, "We have already made efforts at fossil fuel divestment and halting the construction of pipelines, but the next crucial area is finance: focusing on the banks and asset managers that give [those in the fossil fuel industry] the money to do what they do."


## Synopsis

*Falter* is divided into four sections: "The Size of the Board", "Leverage", "The Name of the Game", and "An Outside Chance".

The beginning of *Falter* explains the growing consequences of a changing climate. In detail, Bill McKibben explains how environmental factors such as pollution and ocean acidity are contributing to a decrease in the quality of human and natural life.

The book then describes concerns about economic policy and political ideology. Specifically, *Falter* references numerous individuals who are involved with the oil industry in the U.S. *Falter* contains numerous references to Exxon, which is contributing to the climate emergency through oil exploitation. Criticism of right-wing politics and blame of the Koch Brothers and Donald Trump is prevalent, explaining how conservatism and libertarianism contribute to the climate epidemic.

In the ending of *Falter* McKibben transitions from the warnings of rapid human innovation, then provides reasons for hope, such as renewable energy advances (especially solar panels) and climate activism.


## Reception

*Falter* received positive reviews according to Literary Hub. It was praised by Elizabeth Kolbert and Naomi Klein. One review criticizes the book for its reliance on journalistic sources. The *Washington Post* called *Falter* one of the ten best books of 2019.
