Australian five-dollar note


# Australian five-dollar note



The **Australian five-dollar note** was first issued on 29 May 1967, fifteen months after the currency was changed from the pound to the dollar on 14 February 1960. It was a new denomination with mauve colouration – the pre-decimal system had no denomination with a value of £21⁄2. The first polymer version of the note was introduced on 7 July 1992. A major design update was issued on 1 September 2016, with a minor update to the signatures in 2019.


## Series

* The first issue was a paper note which had a gradient of mauve, with a distinct black overprint. It was designed by Gordon Andrews, with Russell Drysdale as the Reserve Bank of Australia's artistic advisor. It featured portraits of Sir Joseph Banks and Caroline Chisholm, as well as elevations of Sydney streets from Joseph Fowles' "Sydney in 1848", the cover of the *Shipping Gazette*, a watercolour of the Waverley, and a handbill of a meeting of the Family Colonization Loan Society. All of these images were sourced from the State Library of New South Wales.
* The first polymer banknote issue, which can be recognised for its mauve colouration and numeral font, was first issued in pale mauve on 7 July 1992. A number of people found it difficult to distinguish it from the $10 banknote, especially in poor lighting conditions.
* In 1995, a second polymer issue was issued on 24 April, that year, distinguishable by its deeper shade of mauve and a different font for the numeral.
* A federation commemorative was issued on 1 January 2001 until 4 years later. Notes featured Sir Henry Parkes on the obverse and Catherine Helen Spence on the reverse.
* On 1 September 2016, Next Generation Banknote (NGB) $5 was issued. The NGB series banknotes contain more security features than the previous series, including a clear top-to-bottom window.
