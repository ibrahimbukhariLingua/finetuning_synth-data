Motivation, Agency, and Public Policy


# Motivation, Agency, and Public Policy



***Motivation, Agency, and Public Policy*** is a non-fiction book written by the economist Julian Le Grand. The book, which argues in favor of increasing tax choice, was described by *The Economist* as "accessible – and profound" and by *The Times* as "one of the most stimulating books on public policy in recent years".


## Overview

In his book, Le Grand explores ways of increasing the amount of choice and competition in the public sector. This quasi-market would transform citizens from pawns to queens and "improve quality and value for money". Specific policy recommendations include "demogrants" and hypothecation (earmarking).


## Criticism

One criticism is that Le Grand's argument only has limited appeal. "Le Grand’s argument does not speak to libertarians; rejecting the welfare state, they part from him long before he calls on them to cheer for transforming service users into queens. Nor does his argument entice liberal egalitarians."
