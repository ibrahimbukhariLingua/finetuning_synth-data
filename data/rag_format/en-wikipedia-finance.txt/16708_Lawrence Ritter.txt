In researching *The Glory of Their Times*, Ritter travelled a total distance of 75,000 miles (121,000 km) to interview his subjects. Ritter's "Existential" style of interviewing was to allow his subjects to reminisce freely.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The style included not probing or probing them on anything including questions about specific games or specific players.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Ritter's technique was to get his interviewee comfortable around him and tape record while he remained silent.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He is known for finding and interviewing Sam Crawford, who played in the outfield with Ty Cobb in Detroit.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He located him based on a hint to "drive between 175 and 225 miles north of Los Angeles" by Crawford’s wife.
