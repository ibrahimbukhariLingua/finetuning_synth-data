Social security in Switzerland


# Social security in Switzerland



The **social security in Switzerland** (in German *Sozialversicherungen*) includes several public and private insurance plans to assist the welfare of the population.


## Constitutional principles

The basic principles of social insurance are found in Articles 111 to 114 and Articles 116 and 117 of the Swiss Federal Constitution.

Article 111 defines the so-called "three-pillar principle", which regulates the structure of retirement, survivors', and disability benefits. Article 112 provides the basis for the old-age, survivors', and disability insurance, in Article 113 that of occupational pensions. Article 114 regulates the basis of the unemployment insurance; provisions for family allowances and maternity insurance are laid down in Article 116. Finally, in Article 117 sickness and accident insurance is regulated by constitutional law.

The old-age and survivors' insurance (*Alters- und Hinterlassenenversicherung* - AHV), together with the disability insurance (*Invalidenversicherung* - IV) and supplementary benefits, forms the first (state) pillar of the Swiss three-pillar system and serves to adequately safeguard the need for subsistence.


## Financing

Social insurance is mostly financed by direct deductions from individual wages. The contributions are based on an individual's income. They are carried "on a parity basis," half by employers and half by employees. The only exception is health insurance, where income-independent head premiums are paid. In addition, there are also contributions from the public sector, for example old age pensions and disability pensions are financed by 5% from tobacco tax.


## Individual types of social security

Social security insurance was introduced in Switzerland in 1948.
