# Fulhold Pharma



**Fulhold Pharma Limited** (formerly **Fulhold Pharma plc**) is a British pharmaceutical company. It produces the patented CarboHydrate Derived Fulvic Acid (CHD-FA) and formulations containing this product.


## History

Fulhold Pharma was incorporated in February 2014. The main reason was to consolidate its predecessor, Fulhold Ltd (BVI) and its other operations, and to create a vehicle for raising further funding.

Fulhold Pharmaâ€™s Intellectual Property is a biological platform technology with a wide range of applications in human and animal health. This was developed over a period of 10 years prior to the incorporation of Fulhold Pharma. The molecule that is at the heart of this biological platform is **C**arbo**H**ydrate **D**erived **F**ulvic **A**cid (CHD-FA).

CHD-FA is a broad-spectrum anti-microbial/anti-inflammatory compound active on drug resistant Gram positive, Gram negative, and fungal pathogens that can be both ingested and topically applied. CHD-FA in combination with lower levels of antibiotics has demonstrated the same efficacy as higher levels of the same antibiotics alone.

The company's shares were admitted for trading on the GXG Market on 14 April 2015. Trading was suspended on 3 June 2015 at a price of 1.40 GBP and a market capitalisation of $108.9 million. According to financial media group, MoneyWeb, the trading suspension was due to "fallout from the investigations into companies with links to Belvedere Management." A June 2015 article in BizNews described Belvedere Management as one of "four dubious British shell companies." Shareholders include founding director David Cosgrove, who resigned in March 2015, as well as Dualstar Capital Private Equity Fund and the Alexander High Yield Fund. A regulatory investigation by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) downgraded these original accusations to technical administrative breaches and ended in 2017 without any action being taken. A parallel investigation in Mauritius is currently facing legal challenge.

In August 2015, the company acquired Ful Hold Limited which had worked on a topical drug for wounds with Euprotec in 2013.
