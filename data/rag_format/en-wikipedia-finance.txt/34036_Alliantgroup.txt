Alliantgroup


# Alliantgroup



**alliantgroup** is a national tax consulting services firm that works with CPA firms and their business clients to identify and claim available federal and state government-sponsored tax credits and incentives.


## History

alliantgroup was founded in 2002 by Dhaval Jadav and Shane Frank. Prior to alliantgroup, Jadav was an employee of Deloitte & Touche and the Internal Revenue Service. Frank is a former lawyer. alliantgroup's founders noticed the lack of small and midsize businesses that were applying for the R&D tax credit that had been around since 1981, and began the firm in part to help more businesses take advantage of this type of credit.

In 2014, alliantgroup moved its headquarters to a LEED Platinum certified building in Houston, Texas that was designed by Kirksey Architecture. As of 2015, the company had over 600 employees in total. In 2016, roughly 460 employees were working at its Houston branch. The firm has employed people of varying roles and responsibilities including CPAs, engineers, chemists, biologists PhD's and specialists in information technology.

On June 19, 2012, Bloomberg published an article stating that two whistleblowers had filed a claim with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), alleging that alliantgroup had helped clients evade taxes. The claim was filed as part of the IRS's whistleblower program, in which informers could potentially earn a portion of the recovered funds if their claims are deemed to be true. In 2013, the IRS rejected the claim against alliantgroup.

As of 2017, alliantgroup had branches in New York, Chicago, Irvine, Boston, Sacramento, Indianapolis, Orlando and Washington, D.C.

## Controversy

In 2017 the University of Texas and University of Houston systems sued alliantgroup for racketeering. The suit alleged that Alliantgroup and an architectural firm hired by the universities, WHR Architects, Inc., conspired to reap more than $1.6 million in unauthorized tax benefits from the 2007 construction of the $5.5 million University of Houston Center, and the construction of an MD Anderson parking garage and a UT-Health Science Center project. United States District Judge David Hittner dismissed all claims against alliantgroup writing in his opinion, "Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege a concrete, definite, and tangible injury..." The University of Texas was also ordered to remit litigation costs to alliantgroup.

In May 2022, authorities from the IRS conducted an investigation at the building where alliantgroup is located.
