The **Birmingham Stock Exchange** originally opened in 1845. The imposing offices on the corner of Great Charles Street and Margaret Street, now a Grade II listed building, were home to the city's stock exchange from 1928 onwards, and were the centre of Birmingham stockbroking until their closure in 1986 after the Big Bang. Its function was to raise capital through joint stock issues for manufacturers, mineral extractors and railway companies.


## Stock Exchange Association

The Birmingham Stock Exchange Association was formed in 1845, though an association of share brokers was apparently in existence before that date.

It first met in the old Royal Hotel, then, after being held in various hired rooms in Waterloo Passage from c. 1874, it moved in c. 1894 to Newhall Street, where the building in existence in 1955 was opened in 1928.
