### Vinohradská 8

Vinohradská 8 is a project of administrative and living houses at the former site of Transgas complex, Prague, the Czech Republic. HB Reavis bought two out of three buildings of the complex in 2014 and decide to demolish them, to be able to replace them by new constructions designed by Jakub Cigler Architects. After the announcement of the intention to demolish the complex of buildings, a wave of resistance arose among experts and laymen. The Club for Old Prague submitted a proposal for the declaration of Transgas as a cultural monument, but it failed. At the end of 2019, most of the structures had already been demolished.
