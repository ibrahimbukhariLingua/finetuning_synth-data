## Books

* In 2006, Drobny published his first book, *Inside the House of Money: Top Hedge Fund Traders on Profiting in the Global Markets (John Wiley & Sons, 2006)*, which defined global macro as a strategy, featuring interviews with some of the top hedge fund managers at the time across the breadth of sub-strategies comprised within the broad strategy of global macro. The revised edition includes a foreword by Niall Ferguson. A partial list of interviewees includes Peter Thiel, Scott Bessent, and Jim Rogers.
* In 2010, Drobny published *The Invisible Hands: Top Hedge Funds on Bubbles, Crashes and Rethinking Real Money (John Wiley & Sons, 2010)*, a work born out of the crisis of 2008. In this book, Drobny interviewed macro hedge fund managers who preserved capital or profited through the crisis, focusing on elements of their investment processes that could be incorporated by real money managers (pensions, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, charitable foundations, and others). The work was named one of the best business books of 2010 by Bloomberg.
* *The New House of Money (John Wiley & Sons, 2014)*, Drobny's third book, was released on December 3, 2013, through Clocktower Group's website as serialized chapters available for free download. The first chapter is an extended interview with Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital Management . The book features interview discussions with leading hedge fund managers focused on the changes to the global financial landscape since the credit crisis. The serial release format and the emphasis on the evolution of markets in recent years provide a synthesis of Drobny's prior two books.
