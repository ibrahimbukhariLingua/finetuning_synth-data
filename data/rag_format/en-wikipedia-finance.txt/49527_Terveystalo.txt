## History

The history of Terveystalo dates back to the 1940s, when the oldest daughter companies of the concern were founded. Terveystalo started activities in 2001 when the concern was joined by Vaajakosen Lääkäriasema Oy and the Medipa Oy medical stations in Alajärvi, Kauhava and Härmä. The company grew significantly from 2002 to 2007 when over a hundred corporate and business deals were made, and the company has continued to grow. The growth was partially influenced by the company being listed on Nasdaq Helsinki in early 2007.

The largest business deal was made in June 2007 when Suomen Terveystalo Oyj acquired Medivire Työterveyspalvelut Oyj founded in 1995 for 127 million euro. After the deal Suomen Terveystalo Oyj became Finland's largest private healthcare company. In December 2007 Medivire Työterveyspalvelut Oy was renamed Suomen Terveystalo Työterveyspalvelut Oy, and Medivire Työterveyspalvelut was kept as an auxiliary name.

The British capital investment company Bridgepoint Group and its daughter company Star Healthcare made an acquisition offer of Terveystalo on 19 January 2009. Terveystalo Healthcare's listing on Nasdaq Helsinki ended on 25 August 2009 after Star Healthcare had bought the entire company out of the stock market. In early summer 2009 Star Healthcare owned about 97.9% of the company's stock and in August it acquired also the remaining shares. In September 2013 the Bridgepoint Group sold Terveystalo to the Swedish EQT VI fund owned by the Wallenberg family.

In November 2016 the Helsinki Deaconess Institute foundation made a deal to fuse the Diacor healthcare company to Terveystalo in spring 2017. This made the Helsinki Deaconess Institute one of the largest owners of Terveystalo.

In September 2017 Terveystalo announced it would return to Nasdaq Helsinki. At this time, Varma, Hartwall Capital, Rettig Group and the Elo insurance company registered as its anchor investors. The stock release at the time of the listing was overmarked by a manifold and trading the company stock started on the stock market's main list on 13 October 2017. In May 2018 EQT AB announced it would relinquish ownership of Terveystalo.
