### Activity as a Diplomat

In 1987, Borer joined the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) as a diplomat. He was posted to Bern (Department for International Law, 1987 and 1989–93), Lagos (1987/88) and Geneva (1988/89). In 1993, he was appointed Embassy Secretary for Legal and Political Affairs at the Swiss Embassy in Washington, USA. In 1993, Borer played a decisive role in shaping the future strategy of Swiss neutrality policy, which is still in force today. He wrote the report on neutrality. 30 years later, in April and May 2023, Borer publishes a number of articles supported by sound arguments that question Swiss neutrality. On 21 December 1994, he was appointed Deputy General Secretary of the EDA by the Swiss Federal Council. In this role, he led the personnel, technology, logistics, finance and administrative law departments. In addition, he was responsible for the reorganisation of the EDA and the Swiss Representative Network Abroad.

On 25 October 1996 the Swiss Federal Council appointed him Ambassador and Head of the “Switzerland – Second World War” Task Force, which examined the role of Switzerland as a financial centre during the Nazi era. The Task Force contributed substantially to settle a lawsuit filed by the Holocaust survivors against Swiss banks in 1995. As a consequence, on 12 August 1998 the Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse reached an agreement with the claimants and agreed to pay $1.25 billion to victims of the holocaust or their heirs. Borer gained international recognition for his commitment in this process.

On 31 March 1999, the Swiss Federal Council named Borer as Swiss Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany. At the end of April 2002, he left public service and returned to Switzerland. Shortly after he became strategic consultant for Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, and in 2005 a member of the Board of Directors of Renova Group, Viktor Vekselberg's company. He stepped down in 2010 and has since been working as a strategic advisor for different private and public companies.

In the German and international news media, Borer is a popular speaker and commentator on economic issues and on Swiss-German relations, particularly on Switzerland as a financial center and on the banking secrecy.


### Consultant

After retiring from diplomacy, Thomas Borer became a management consultant in 2002. Since then he has been active in the strategic representation of interests in politics, business, society and the media. He performs various mandates for companies and individuals.

From 2010 to 2015 Borer was president and chief executive officer of *Swiss Authentication Research and Development AG*, which develops chemical and physical security solutions to protect against counterfeit products. He was also a member of the advisory board of Corestate Capital Holding SA between 2010 and 2017. Borer currently also holds various board memberships.

In January 2015 it was announced that Borer would support the Kazakh government interests in Switzerland from spring 2014 for a fee of 30,000 dollars per month. The focus was on the extradition of Viktor Vyacheslavovich Chrapunov, a Kazakh oligarch and former Kazakh energy minister, who embezzled millions and then applied for asylum in Switzerland. The Federal Prosecutor's office dismissed an indictment by Chrapunow against Borer .

Borer appears in the media as a speaker and commentator on geopolitical and economic issues, on German-Swiss relations, especially with the Swiss financial center and banking secrecy, as well as international political relations in Europe and North America.
