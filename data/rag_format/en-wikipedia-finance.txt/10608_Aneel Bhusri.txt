## Career

In 1993, Bhusri became the director of planning at PeopleSoft, then primarily a human resources software company. Later, working for David Duffield, with whom he went on to co-found Workday, he became responsible for product strategy and marketing. In 1999, he became vice chairman of the company, serving in that role until the takeover by Oracle in 2004. In the meantime, PeopleSoft had developed ERP, CRM, and other offerings, in addition to Human Resource Management.

At Greylock he has been an investor in cloud technologies, with an emphasis on applications, data center infrastructure and middleware, and serves on the boards of a number of companies in which Greylock has invested, including Cloudera and Pure Storage.


### Workday

In 2003, Oracle made a $13 billion bid in a hostile corporate takeover attempt of PeopleSoft. This and later offers were rejected by PeopleSoft's board of directors. Despite a U.S. Department of Justice suit to block the takeover, on the grounds of anti-trust infringement, in December 2004, Oracle announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire PeopleSoft for approximately $10.3 billion.
In 2005, Workday was co-founded by David Duffield and Bhusri with funding from Greylock Partners. Workday sells software and services using the SaaS model.

Bhusri is the chief executive officer (CEO) at Workday. He is also a member of the company's board of directors, and served as chairman of the board from 2012 until May 2014.

In April 2020, Bhusri donated $1 million to the Give2SF fund, a donation drive to help residents and businesses in San Francisco affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2020, he was ranked No. 359 on the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America.

In January 2024, Bhusri will step down as CEO at Workday and Carl Eschenbach will take over as CEO. Currently, Bhusri and Eschenbach are working together as co-CEOs. In 2024, Bhusri will serve as full-time executive chair and chair of the board of directors.
