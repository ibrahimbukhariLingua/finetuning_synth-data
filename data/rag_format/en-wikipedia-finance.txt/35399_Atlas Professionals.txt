# Atlas Professionals



**Atlas Professionals** is a Dutch provider of recruitment and HR services within the energy and marine sectors globally, and has its headquarters in Hoofddorp.


## History

Leo Burghouwt, Theo Klinkenberg and Thea Biemans establish the company in 1982 in Weesp, initially as an agent for worldwide transport over water. In 1986, the company expanded into personnel services for waterway contracting and started trading under the name of *Atlas Personnel Services* (initially *Atlas Transport Services*).

In 1999, René Neelissen and Marcel Burghouwt became shareholders and Managing Directors of the company. In that year, the company name was changed to *Atlas Services Group* and the first acquisition was completed. The acquisitions of Eurosailor BV in 1999 and of Tristar Well Service Pool BV in 2000, are the key factors in the buy and build of personnel services within the marine and energy industries. In the following decades, Atlas aims to grow through mergers and acquisitions. From 1999 until 2014, Atlas acquires parties in a wide range of specific market segments in the energy and marine industries.

In 2011, HAL Investments BV (European investment subsidiary of HAL Holding NV, listed on Euronext Amsterdam), takes 45% interest in Atlas Services Group.

In 2013, the company's trading name was changed to *Atlas Professionals*.

In 2016, HAL Investments BV purchased an additional 25% interest.
