# Selver



**Selver** is a chain of supermarkets and hypermarkets operating in Estonia. Selver is a subsidiary of Tallinna Kaubamaja Grupp. The chain was established in 1995 with the opening of Punane Selver in Lasnamäe, Tallinn. Expansion outside of Tallinn began on 10 May 2002 with the opening of Mai Selver in Pärnu. Since 18 December 2008 Selver also operated in Latvia, but at the end of 2009 due to the financial crisis Selver was forced to close all its 6 supermarkets in Latvia. There are currently 73 stores in operation all over Estonia (as of August 2022).

In 2012 – **Kulinaaria OÜ** – a subsidiary of **AS Selver** was created. Kulinaaria, which has grown into the most modern food producer in the Baltics, currently supplies Selveri Köök’s food to Selver stores across Estonia. Other clients include the convenience stores of Olerex and Alexela, as well as Tallink ships. In addition to the Selveri Köök brand, the Van Kook and Gurmee Catering brands have also been established.

In 2021, the home delivery area of the **Selver e-store** expanded to all of Estonia. With the expansion, e-Selver became the only e-grocery store that delivers goods home by courier to every county in mainland Estonia and the large islands throughout their entire extent.
