## History

The Montevideo Stock Exchange has its origins in the nineteenth century, when the "Montevideo Bag Society" was created in 1867. Its main aim was to provide trade of the square of a meeting point at a fixed time, to treat the business of the day.

Simultaneously, two business bodies were created: The Chambre Syndicale, representing the interests of commerce, and the Intern Brokers Commission, which regulated the activity of both.

In 1921 the Commission became a civil non-profitable association, which worked as a field of stock trading and brokers guild. In 1952 this committee was renamed the "Stock Exchange". In 1997 the stock market was separated from the Stock Exchange and in 2004 adopted its current name "Montevideo Stock Exchange."

During the first decade of the twentieth century stock market operations grew strongly. Between 1929 and 1933 there was a period of decline in market activity due to the crisis of 1929. From 1934 to 1947 growth came back being more involved with the growth of private equity. Between 1950 and 1970 activity shrank, persisting a shift towards short-term bank loans and the purchase of government securities.

The return to growth occurred between 1970 and 1985 but, after that last year, the share of private equity shrank . In 1995 it was decided to incorporate financial institutions as special partners. In 1996 the trading activity was favored with the appearance of the Savings Fund Administrators (AFAP ) and the Securities Market Act and Notes. The following year, the BVM developed its System Clearing, Settlement and Custody . In 2008 it began operating with the electronic Spanish Stock Market Integrated System (SIBE ) .
