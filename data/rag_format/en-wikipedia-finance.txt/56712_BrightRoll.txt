# BrightRoll



**BrightRoll** was a programmatic video advertising platform that was acquired by Yahoo. BrightRoll's video platform became Yahoo's primary video advertising marketplace and demand-side platform. The BrightRoll brand was discontinued by Verizon Media, the parent company of Yahoo, in favor of Verizon Media Video SSP (re-brand of AOL's One Video Platform) after the company merged. Yahoo and AOL consolidated their ad platforms during 2017â€“2018 to phase out duplicate platforms.

BrightRoll was founded in June 2006 by Tod Sacerdoti, who became the company's CEO, and Dru Nelson. Its headquarters were in San Francisco, California, with offices across the United States, Canada, and Europe.

In November 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would acquire BrightRoll for $640 million.
