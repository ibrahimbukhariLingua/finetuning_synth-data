# Alpro



**Alpro** is a European company based in Ghent, Belgium, that markets organic and non-organic, non-genetically modified, plant-based products, such as foods and drinks made from soy, almonds, hazelnuts, cashew, rice, oats or coconut. Alpro employs over 1,200 people in Europe and has three production facilities in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. Alpro markets its products in Europe and beyond with the majority of its business in Europe.


## History

Alpro was founded in 1980, as a subsidiary of the Vandemoortele Groep, which is based in Belgium. Alpro expanded across Europe and in 2000 built a soy milk plant in Burton Latimer, England.

In 2008, Alpro launched the UK's first "reduced calorie soya alternative to yogurt" following the introduction of its Soy Light "reduced calorie soya milk" in 2006.

Alpro's revenues are reported to have tripled during the period from 2000 to 2008. In 2009, beverages made up two-thirds of Alpro's revenues.

In June 2009, Vandemoortele sold Alpro for an estimated US$455 million to Dean Foods, which marketed the "Silk" soy milk brand in the US.

In June 2013, WhiteWave, the Dean Foods subsidiary that managed Alpro, was spun-off as an independent company – listing on the New York Stock Exchange. In July 2013, Dean Foods sold their remaining 19.9% stake in WhiteWave, thus ending their involvement with Alpro.

In July 2016, it was announced that the French company Danone would purchase WhiteWave Foods for $10.4 billion. The acquisition was completed in April 2017 and newly formed company is named "DanoneWave".

In 2020, Alpro's *No Sugars* oatmilk won the Lausanne Index Prize – Supreme Award, a processed food prize.

Alpro's general manager is Sue Garfitt.

The Provamel brand is reserved exclusively for organic products (including many organic versions of Alpro Soya products), which are intended for sale only by independent health food retailers.

Alpro soya milk scored best (out of 16 tested different plain soy milks), when rated by Germany's leading consumer safety group Stiftung Warentest.

Other Alpro products include yogurt as well as "dessert and meat alternative products".


## Marketing activities

To demonstrate Alpro's milk and yogurt alternatives, a year-long experiential marketing campaign gave consumers in the UK the opportunity to sample the breakfast menu products at various events and shopping centres around the country. Alpro also encouraged visitors to have their photo taken at the internet pod on the stand and upload it to Facebook, thereby joining the Alpro Soya Facebook page.
