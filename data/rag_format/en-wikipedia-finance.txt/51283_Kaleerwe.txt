Kaleerwe


# Kaleerwe



**Kaleerwe** is a neighborhood within Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. Kaleerwe is a busy road-side marketplace, beyond which is a residential slum. Due to its relative low altitude, compared to the surrounding hills, and its proximity to a wetland, the area is prone to flooding. Kaleerwe merges with its immediate slum-neighborhood to the southwest, Bwaise. One may argue that Kaleerwe is part of Bwaise.
