Association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada


# Association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada



**Association of Public Treasurers of the United States and Canada** (APTUSC) is the professional society of active public treasurers of counties, provinces, cities, and special districts in the United States and Canada. It sets ethical standards for the treasury profession in state and local government.

The treasurer of a public agency is elected by the voting public or are appointed staff. Public treasurers are primarily responsible for managing the revenue and cash flow of the agency. This officer is also responsible for banking, collections of user fees such as utility usage and business licenses, and communicating financial performance and forecasts to the community.


## Membership role

Members are treasurers of municipalities and other local government agencies, whether elected or appointed, having responsibility for collection, receipt, reporting, custody, investment or disbursement of municipal funds. Municipal funding sources are commonly property tax, sales tax, income tax, utility users tax (UUT), transient occupancy tax (hotel occupancy), and user fees such as licensing and permit fees.

Many Treasurers are elected, and are therefore directly accountable to their constituents; the remainder are appointed either by City Council or City Manager.


## Professional standards setting

APTUSC offers a **Certified Public Finance Administrator** (CPFA) certification program. CPFA is a professional post-nominal awarded to a public treasurer who meets standards of education, experience and a stated commitment to a code of ethics. CPFA candidates must meet or exceed requirements in two areas; 50% educational standards and 50% experience and training requirements. Certification is also designed as a guide for municipal treasurers to become valued administrators in local government.


## Training and education in municipal treasury

APTUSC has technical and professional committees that deal with issues facing treasurers, their agencies and the public. APTUSC also provides web-based technical support resources, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members. APTUSC's annual conferences provide an array of education across many topics and are held annually between various locations. The association conducts workshops to provide training and education on investments, cash management, bond sales, management skills, communications, and legislation.
