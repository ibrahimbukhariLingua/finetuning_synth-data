Banca Lombarda e Piemontese


# Banca Lombarda e Piemontese



**Banca Lombarda e Piemontese** was an Italian banking group. It was formed as **Banca Lombarda** in 1998 by the merger of Banca San Paolo di Brescia (with subsidiary Banca di Valle Camonica) and Credito Agrario Bresciano (with subsidiary Banco di San Giorgio). The group merged with Banca Regionale Europea in 2000, which changed their name to reflect the extension to Piedmont region. In 2007 the group merged with Banche Popolari Unite to form UBI Banca.

The group was a minority shareholders of Banca Intesa, partly due to the sales of Cariparma's shares to Banca Intesa and partially due to the warrants issued to Banca San Paolo di Brescia.
