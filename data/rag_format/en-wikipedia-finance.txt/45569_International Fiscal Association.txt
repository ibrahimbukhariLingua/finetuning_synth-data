## History

The association was established in the winter of 1938 in The Hague, Netherlands, at the end of Interwar period. The association was created in response to and increasing internationalisation of the world's economies with international tax issues becoming more numerous.

Along with the increasing internationalization of the world's economies, international tax issues become more numerous and of greater importance. IFA played a role both in the development of certain principles of international taxation and in providing possible solutions to problems arising in their practical implementation since the end of the Second World War.

In 2005, IFA adopted the initiative of advocate Itzik Amiel - The Young IFA Network (YIN) with the aim to increase the participation of tax professionals in IFA during the early stages of their careers so that they can develop meaningful and long-lasting relationships with their peers from across the world. The YIN Committee and YIN Representatives assist in developing, proposing and implementing various activities at the Branch, regional, and global levels of IFA.
