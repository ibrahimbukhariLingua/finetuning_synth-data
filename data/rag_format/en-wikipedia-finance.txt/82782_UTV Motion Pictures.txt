UTV Motion Pictures


# UTV Motion Pictures



**UTV Motion Pictures** (also known as **Disney UTV** from 2012–13) was the feature film unit of UTV Software Communications founded by Ronnie Screwvala and Zarina Screwvala in 1996 as UTV Motion Pictures Plc., the film distribution division of UTV Software Communications. It was one of the leading film studios in India and one of the largest production studios in South Asia. The studio's activities spanned creative development, production, marketing, distribution, licensing, merchandising, and worldwide syndication of films in Indian territories. It was also a distribution label of Disney for feature films produced by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in India.

UTV Motion Pictures had a library of domestic regional films and animation productions alongside select international productions with the studio moving into film production in Bollywood, and further expanding in Hollywood in partnership with studios such as 20th Century Studios, Walt Disney Pictures and Sony Pictures. In July 2017, Disney shut down UTV Motion Pictures, shortly after the release of the film *Jagga Jasoos*, and planned to focus on its Hollywood films distribution and television and licensing and merchandising businesses through the banner, effectively pulling the plug on its Hindi film production.

## International films distribution in India


### Walt Disney Studios films in India

UTV's distribution relations with Disney first began when in 2005, Miramax Films, then owned by The Walt Disney Company, sold distribution rights to several films of their catalog in a 10-year deal; however it is currently unknown whether this deal continued even when Miramax was sold to Filmyard Holdings. In December 2008, following their purchase of a majority stake in UTV, The Walt Disney Company, which would later acquire the entirety of UTV Motion Pictures through UTV Software Communications in 2012, handed over exclusive distribution rights to their films in the Indian subcontinent, starting with Walt Disney Pictures' *Bedtime Stories*. UTV Motion Pictures became the exclusive distributor for all Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures releases for South Asian territories from 2013 onward. Distribution rights to 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) and Fox Searchlight Pictures (now Searchlight Pictures) films continued to be handled by Fox Star Studios (now Star Studios) until late 2019 with *The Art of Racing in the Rain*, when Buena Vista International began releasing the studios' films internationally and thus UTV acquired the distribution rights to their films in the Indian subcontinent, starting with *Terminator: Dark Fate* until 2024 with *Alien: Romulus*.
