## History

Runa Capital was founded by technological entrepreneurs Serg Bell and Ilya Zubarev (founders of Acronis and Parallels), and their MIPT university friend Dmitry Chikhachev. The idea of the venture firm took shape in 2009 and was formally incorporated in 2010. The partners contributed their own money into the first fund and raised capital from friends and other international investors including Achim Weiss and Andreas Gauger, founders of German hosting provider 1&1, and Edward Nicholson, former CEO of Brunswick-UBS.

In 2011, Andre Bliznyuk joined Runa Capital as a General Partner. In 2022, the firm promoted its principals, Konstantin Vinogradov and Michael Fanfant, to general partners focusing on Europe and the U.S., respectively. In 2023, Serg Bell ceased his involvement in Runa Capital and resigned as a general partner.

Since 2020, Runa Capital operated the so-called Runa Open Source Startup (ROSS) Index, a quarterly ranking of the 20 fastest-growing open-source software startups (in 2023, it also published an annual report on the commercial open-source software trends).


## Funds

* Runa Capital I, firm's first namesake fund was launched in 2010, reached its final size of $135 million by 2012 and was focused on investments from seed to Series B stage. The initial idea was to fund globally oriented Eastern European startups in the fields of cloud computing, machine learning, virtualization, mobile and internet apps, but later the partners expanded their investment area to Europe and USA.
