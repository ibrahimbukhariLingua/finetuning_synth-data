In September 2014, Butera was named the seventh commissioner of the Arena Football League, replacing Jerry Kurz, who took the role of president of the league. It was Butera's first involvement in the management of a sports league. His initial focus was on increasing consumer awareness of the AFL brand so that it could grow revenues through strategic partnerships and sponsor programs; he was to work closely with Kurz on football operations to maximize opportunities to integrate spectator experiences.
