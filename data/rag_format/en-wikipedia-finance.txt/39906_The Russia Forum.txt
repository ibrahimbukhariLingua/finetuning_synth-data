The Russia Forum


# The Russia Forum



**The Russia Forum** was an annual event held in Moscow, hosted by Troika Dialog from 2008 to 2013. From 2012, The Russia Forum was jointly presented by Sberbank of Russia and Troika Dialog.

It was sometimes referred to as the "Russian Davos" (World Economic Forum in Davos), not only because the event in Switzerland is held a few days before the forum in Moscow, but also because of the high-profile nature of the speakers and scale of the industry leading agenda and high-level discussion attracted to The Russia Forum.

The Russia Forum was one of the key economic events of the year, attracting an audience of key global investors, globally renowned economists, executives and leaders from global companies, along with Russian and foreign political leaders and for discussions around social, economic, political and financial issues faced by Russian, the CIS region and the broader world economy.

From 2008 to 2013, participants of The Russia Forum gathered annually in Moscow to exchange opinions through a format of open debate and continuous dialogue to hear different viewpoints on issues regarding global growth. They were able to communicate directly with leading politicians, executives of top Russian and global companies, leading scholars, international investors, cultural-societal figureheads and influential members of the media from around the world. In addition to the large number of panel sessions and conferences, one-on-one investor meetings were also held as part of the format and unparalleled networking opportunities of The Russia Forum.
