Fox Networks Group


# Fox Networks Group



**Fox Networks Group** (**FNG**), formerly known as **Fox International Channels** (**FIC**), was the television networks division of News Corporation and later 21st Century Fox that operated from 1993 to 2021. It oversaw the production, broadcasting and distribution of the Fox, Fox Sports, National Geographic and BabyTV brands in the United States and over 1.725 billion households globally. The division also operated video on demand services Fox Play and Fox Plus.

The domestic broadcast units of 21st Century Fox jointly operated Fox International Channels until 2016 when its units were absorbed into this division. This domestic unit (FIC) consisted of Fox Television Group, Fox Cable Networks, Fox Sports Media Group, Fox News Group, National Geographic Partners and Fox Networks Digital Consumer Group. Following the completed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by the Walt Disney Company on March 20, 2019, the units making up the Fox Networks Group were dispersed into both the division's parent company's successor, Fox Corporation and Disney. Disney then revived the *Walt Disney Television* name previously used for their former television production company for their networks division at the time known as *Disney–ABC Television Group* to and retooled its international networks division previously known as *Disney International Operations* (later renamed latter as *Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International*, then Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution) to absorb the non-U.S. units. Walt Disney Television changed name to Disney General Entertainment Content in 2021, DMED was dissolved in 2023 and the units of the latter got transferred to Disney's latest division, Disney Entertainment, with the channels being subsequently rebranded as either FX or the Star Channel while being taken over by Disney's international regional subsidiaries. The last Fox channel rebranding was in Spain on March 11, 2024.
