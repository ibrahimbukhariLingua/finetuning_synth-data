## History


### Early history

Bupa (originally the *British United Provident Association*) was established in 1947 when seventeen British provident associations joined to provide healthcare for the general public. The firm is a private company limited by guarantee; it has no shareholders, and any profits (after tax) are reinvested in the business.

The services offered by Bupa began as private medical insurance, offering policies to individuals, companies and other organisations, and eventually expanded to include privately run hospitals, outpatient clinics, health assessments, GP services, dental centres, digital health, aged care and other health services.


### Growth and international expansion


#### 1970s

Bupa has expanded internationally from its UK operations. Malta was the site of Bupa's first overseas business in 1971 and it started insurance operations in Hong Kong in 1976.


#### 1980s

In 1982, Bupa International was launched to provide worldwide medical cover to people working outside their home country. This business division is now branded as 'Bupa Global'.

In 1989, Bupa acquired '*Sanitas'* S.A. de Seguros, now Spain's second largest private medical insurer. This has expanded to become a combined health insurance, hospital, clinic, dental and aged care business operating under the Sanitas brand.


#### 1990s

During the 1990s, Bupa continued to expand internationally. An insurance business was established in Thailand which was sold in 2017 to Aetna. Bupa Ireland, a health insurance business, was established in 1996 but sold in 2007.

Bupa also diversified in the UK into care homes with the acquisition of 200 homes through Community Nursing Homes, Goldsborough Healthcare Group and Care First Group.

In 1997, Bupa entered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in partnership with the Nazer Group to form Bupa Arabia. In 2008, Bupa Arabia was listed on the Tadawul, the Saudi stock market. Bupa Arabia is now the leading health insurance provider in the KSA. Bupa owns 43.25% of this business.


#### 2000–2010

In the 2000s, Bupa entered the Australian health insurance market, opened hospitals in Spain and expanded its network of clinics and care homes in the UK.

In 2007, Bupa completed the sale of its UK hospitals business to Spire Healthcare. Bupa's rationale was that the scale of both its UK hospitals and insurance businesses meant that they were becoming increasingly constrained by being part of the same group.

Significant acquisitions followed. The largest of these was the merger of Bupa's insurance business in Australia with the insurance group MBF to form what was then Australia's second largest private medical insurer. In 2011, Bupa Australia brought together the insurance brands MBF, HBA and Mutual Community under the Bupa brand. Bupa acquired the Amity Group of care homes in Australia in 2007.

In 2010, Bupa launched a partnership in India with Max India Ltd. In 2019, Bupa completed the transition to a new partner, True North, while retaining a 44.42% stake in the business, which is now branded Niva Bupa.


#### Since 2010

In 2012, Bupa acquired the largest private healthcare network in Poland, LUX MED, from the private equity fund Mid Europa Partners for €400m.

Other acquisitions in this period included: Dental Corporation, Australia and New Zealand's largest dental provider; Quality HealthCare, a private clinic network in Hong Kong; a 49% stake in Highway to Health**,** Inc., a US health insurer specialising in providing international health insurance for US residents planning to live or work abroad.

In February 2015, Bupa acquired a controlling share in Chilean private healthcare network Cruz Blanca. In 2016, Bupa became the sole owner of Cruz Blanca (branded as Bupa Chile). Bupa Chile opened a major hospital in Santiago in 2018.

In 2016, Bupa acquired Care Plus, a health insurance business in Brazil.

In the UK, in 2016, Bupa sold its home healthcare medication delivery division to Celesio AG.

In 2017, Bupa completed the purchase of Oasis Dental Care, the UK's leading private dental provider with 380 practices, for £835 million, from Bridgepoint, a Private Equity group. As a result, Bupa became a major dental provider. The business has since grown to around 490 clinics in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Bupa operates dental practices in the Republic of Ireland under the Smiles Dental brand.

In the UK, in August 2017, it sold 122 care homes, with 9,000 beds, to HC-One for £300 million. 22 further homes were sold to Advinia Healthcare.

In 2018, Sanitas acquired Nectar Seguros, a Spanish private health insurer.

In January 2019, Bupa acquired Acibadem Sigorta in Turkey. Bupa Acıbadem Sigorta is Turkey's second largest health insurer with both corporate and individual customers. Headquartered in Istanbul, it insures 600,000 people. In December 2020, Bupa México announced the acquisition of BBVA México's medical services provider Vitamédica. In January 2021, in the UK, the transfer of CS Healthcare's business and 17,500 members to Bupa completed.

Iñaki Ereño became Group CEO in January 2021. Ereño was previously the CEO of Bupa's Europe and Latin America division.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting war, Bupa announced that it would be ending relations with businesses in Russian and Russian-controlled businesses.

Through its business in Poland, Lux/Med, Bupa has been working with the authorities and other institutions to offer urgent free medical assistance to refugees from Ukraine through its 258 medical centres and 13 hospitals. It has set up teams of paramedics, doctors and medical equipment to solve the problems of the refugees and their families, as well as providing employment for Ukrainian medial staff in its facilities.

Staff and families of residents in some care homes have criticised Bupa for allegedly prioritising profits to the detriment of care.

In 2017, there was a data breach involving health insurance customers in the Bupa Global division.

In 2018, Bupa UK was fined £1,500,000 after a care home resident died after contracting Legionnaire's disease.

Bupa has been fined over £3 million by UK government agencies since 2013


### Australia

Bupa's operations in Australia have been the subject of regulatory action and criticism in news media, particularly in 2018 and 2019.

Previous issues and allegations made include:

* Neglect of elderly patients or residents. Complaints by the Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck that Bupa had persistently failed to meet regulatory standards. Bupa's ANZ CEO gave an apology on ABC for "totally unacceptable" failings . There were other incidents including infection related incidents and assault. For example, a carer in New South Wales was found to have assaulted an 82 year old resident; the family of the resident put CCTV there.
* Charging aged care residents in 20 of its homes for "extra" services that were not ultimately delivered to 4,306 residents. Bupa's apology and explanation of the issue are here. In May 2020, the Australian Federal Court approved a AUS$6m settlement between Bupa and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
