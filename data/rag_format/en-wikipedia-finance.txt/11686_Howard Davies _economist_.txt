In July 2023, as Chairman of NatWest Group, Sir Howard expressed confidence in his Chief Executive, Dame Alison Rose, who had breached client confidentiality in discussing the bank account of Nigel Farage with a BBC reporter. Shortly after expressing that confidence, Rose was forced to resign when the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and others in Government expressed concern at her apparent gross misconduct. Rose's resignation led to calls for Sir Howard to resign. On 27 July, Sunak refused to endorse Davies to stay in the role.

In January 2024, Davies was the subject of controversy following his comment that it was "not that difficult" to buy a house in the UK.
