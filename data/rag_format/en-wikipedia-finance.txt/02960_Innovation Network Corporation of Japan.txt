The **Innovation Network Corporation of Japan** (**INCJ**) (株式会社産業革新機構, *Kabushiki-gaisha Sangyō Kakushin Kikō*), headquartered in Tokyo, is a public-private partnership between the Japanese government and 19 major corporations.

The INCJ was established as a temporary (15 years) corporate entity on July 27, 2009; with the prime objective of "boosting the competitiveness of Japanese firms by promoting a philosophy of 'open innovation' and creating next-generation businesses in promising new technologies by providing capital and managerial support, through private-public partnership."

The business and investments of INCJ are supervised by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI).


## History

In early 2009, the Japanese government along with major Japanese corporations conceptualized the legal framework of a corporate entity - whose aim is *to leverage Japanese technological and industrial prowess to create sustainable next-generation businesses using a philosophy of "Open Innovation" and enhance the value of Japanese businesses.*

On July 27, 2009, the Japanese government under the *Act on Special Measures for Industrial Revitalization* and *Other Laws to Foster Innovation in Industrial Activities in Japan*, established the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ). The INCJ was created to make investments aimed at creating an ecosystem of innovation and fostering an “open innovation” model, i.e. “flow of technology and expertise beyond the boundaries of existing organisational structures" — be it start-up companies, medium-sized enterprises or large, established firms.

In September 2018, the INCJ was reorganized with Japan Investment Corporation (JIC) being spun-off as a new separate entity following the enforcement of the amendment to the Act on Strengthening Industrial Competitiveness. INCJ then became a subsidiary of JIC.

The primary objective is to provide capital and managerial support to boost the competitiveness of Japanese firms and create next-generation businesses in promising new technologies, which contribute to innovative transformation of Japan’s industrial structure.


## Organisation and leadership

The INCJ is headquartered at Tokyo and has a flat management structure centered around CEO and COO

Its current CEO is Kimikazu Noumi and COO, Haruyasu Asakura.
