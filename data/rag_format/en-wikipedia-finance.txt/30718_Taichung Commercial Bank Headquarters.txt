Taichung Commercial Bank Headquarters


# Taichung Commercial Bank Headquarters



The **Taichung Commercial Bank Headquarters**, also known as **Taichung Diamond** (Chinese: 台中商銀新總行大樓 or Chinese: 台中之鑽) is an under construction skyscraper located in Taichung's 7th Redevelopment Zone, Xitun District, Taichung, Taiwan. It will be the tallest building in Taichung and the first building to surpass 200 m (660 ft) in Taichung. Designed by Aedas, the architectural height of building is 225 m (738 ft), the floor area is 115,310 m² (1,241,200 sq ft), and it comprises 38 floors above ground, as well as 10 basement levels. It will be completed in 2024 and will become the headquarter of Taichung Bank as well as housing a luxury hotel.


## Design

The architectural design concept is derived from the Taichung Commercial Bank corporate logo with the Chinese character "Chinese: 中". Taking the image of the bank, money, gems, and the cornucopia as the main axis, the crystal-like appearance is clear, and the cornucopia is inlaid with the image of shining pearls, which symbolizes the "Diamond of Taichung" and hence its alternative name.

This building avoids the practice of concentrating all large functional areas in a single tower. Therefore, two separate towers are created, with features including a series of "floating" transparent glass boxes are placed in the space between the two towers used for exhibition space, sky gardens, conference facilities, banquet halls, and suspended swimming pools.
