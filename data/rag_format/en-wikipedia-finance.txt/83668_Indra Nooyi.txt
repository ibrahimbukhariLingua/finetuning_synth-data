Indra Nooyi


# Indra Nooyi



**Indra Nooyi** (née **Krishnamurthy**; born October 28, 1955) is an Indian-born American business executive who was the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of PepsiCo from 2006 to 2018.

Nooyi has consistently ranked among the world's 100 most powerful women. In 2014, she was ranked at number 13 on the *Forbes* list, and the second most powerful woman on the *Fortune* list in 2015 and 2017. She sits on the boards of Amazon and the International Cricket Council, among other organizations.


## Early life

Nooyi was born on October 28, 1955, in a Tamil Brahmin family in Madras (now known as Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India. Nooyi did her schooling in Holy Angels Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School in T. Nagar.

Nooyi's mother was a home maker. While not having a formal education herself, her mother devised strategic games at dinner for her daughters. When Nooyi and her sister were between eight and 11 years old, their mother instructed them to write a speech about what they would do if they held a position of power such as president or prime minister. If Nooyi fell short in a task, her paternal grandfather (a judge) would make her write, "I will not make excuses" 200 times on a piece of paper.


## Education

While completing her studies, Nooyi played guitar in a band, and excelled at cricket. Nooyi received bachelor's degrees in physics, chemistry and mathematics from Madras Christian College of the University of Madras in 1975, and a Post Graduate Programme Diploma from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta in 1976.

In 1978, Nooyi was admitted to Yale School of Management and moved to the United States, where she earned a master's degree in public and private management in 1980.


## Career

Nooyi began her career in India with product manager positions at Johnson & Johnson and the textile firm Beardsell Ltd. While attending Yale School of Management, Nooyi completed a summer internship with Booz Allen Hamilton. In 1980, Nooyi joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as a strategy consultant, and then worked at Motorola as vice president and Director of Corporate Strategy and Planning, followed by a stint at Asea Brown Boveri.


### PepsiCo

Nooyi joined PepsiCo in 1994, and was named CEO in 2006, replacing Steven Reinemund, becoming the fifth CEO in PepsiCo's 44-year history. She started as PepsiCo's senior vice president for strategic planning from 1994 until 1996, then became senior vice president for corporate strategy and development from 1996 until 2000. Next, she became senior vice president and chief financial officer of PepsiCo from February 2000 to April 2001, moving then to president and chief financial officer, beginning in 2001, and was also named to PepsiCo's board of directors.

Nooyi directed the company's global strategy for more than a decade and led PepsiCo's restructuring, including the 1997 divestiture of Tricon, now known as Yum! Brands. Tricon included companies like Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell under its umbrella. The financial gains from this spinoff allowed the company to increase the pace of its share buyback strategy, thereby giving it more leverage to pursue future acquisitions without as much shareholder backlash. Nooyi also worked on the acquisition of Tropicana in 1998, and the merger with Quaker Oats Company, which also brought Gatorade in 2001. The $3.3 billion acquisition of Tropicana initially faced opposition from other PepsiCo executives and Wall Street critics. The Quaker Oats Company's ownership of Gatorade was a lucrative move for PepsiCo, since Gatorade was responsible for 80% of sports drink sales at the time. Similar to the Tropicana acquisition, this strategic move gave PepsiCo leverage against Coca-Cola, owner of Powerade – second in the sports drink segment. PepsiCo's annual net profit rose from $2.7 billion to $6.5 billion.

Nooyi was named on *Wall Street Journal*'s list of 50 women to watch in 2007 and 2008, and was listed among *Time*'s 100 Most Influential People in The World in 2007 and 2008. *Forbes* named her the #3 most powerful woman in 2008. In 2014, she was ranked #13 by *Forbes*. *Fortune* ranked her the #1 in the list of Most Powerful Women in Business in 2009 and 2010. On October 7, 2010, Fortune magazine ranked her the 6th most powerful woman in the world. In *Fortune*'s Most Powerful Women List of 2015, Nooyi ranked second.

Nooyi's strategic redirection of PepsiCo was called "Performance with a Purpose," focused on creating long-term growth while leaving a positive impact on society and the environment. She reclassified PepsiCo's products into three categories: "fun for you" (such as potato chips and regular soda), "better for you" (diet or low-fat versions of snacks and sodas), and "good for you" (items such as oatmeal). She moved corporate spending away from junk foods and into the healthier alternatives, with the aim of improving the healthiness of even "fun" offerings. In 2015, Nooyi removed aspartame from Diet Pepsi, although in 2016 aspartame was reintroduced due to public backlash.

Nooyi also focused on environmental concerns and sustainability, redesigning packaging to reduce waste, conserving water, switching to renewable energy sources, and recycling. She also worked on creating a culture of employee retention. As one example, Nooyi wrote to the parents of her leadership team and visited their homes to create a more personal connection.

In 2018, Nooyi stated an intent to develop a line of snacks marketed specifically for women, feeling that it was a hitherto unexplored category. In a radio interview, Nooyi stated that PepsiCo was getting ready to launch products designed and packaged as per women's preferences, and based on behavioral differences in the way men and women consume snacks.

At one point, PepsiCo even considered changing its name and move away from its namesake cola, but the health push faltered. On August 6, 2018, Nooyi stepped down as CEO, and Ramon Laguarta, a 22-year veteran of PepsiCo, replaced her on October 3, as well as becoming a member of the board of directors. However, Nooyi continued as the chair of the company until early 2019. Nooyi was CEO for 12 years, seven years longer than the average CEO tenure at large companies according to an Equilar study.
