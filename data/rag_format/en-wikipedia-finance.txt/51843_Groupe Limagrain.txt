## Core businesses

Field Seeds have always been very much part of Limagrain's historical core business. The Field Seeds activity has been part of Vilmorin & Cie since 2006, and is organized according to two main markets. In Europe, Limagrain Europe is the leading player. In North America, AgReliant, a joint venture with the German seeds company KWS, holds 3rd position on the corn seed market for the United States.

* Vegetable Seeds and Garden Products

Now part of Vilmorin & Cie, the Vegetable Seeds activity has been a major business for Limagrain since 1975. It targets the professional markets of growers and canners. Vilmorin & Cie provides them with vegetable seeds with high added value, and is the second largest company in the world on this market.
Dedicated to amateur gardeners, the Garden Products activity proposes seeds of different flower and vegetable varieties, and also bulbs and products for the health and beauty of plants. Vilmorin & Cie is active on the main European gardening markets with a portfolio of well-known brands.

* Bakery and Cereal Ingredients

For Limagrain, the cereal products activity, including cereal ingredients and bakery products, constitutes a fundamental asset for valorizing the agricultural production of its members.
