## History

The original Citizens National Bank location opened on Main Street in Paintsville on February 16, 1910, and was known as **Paintsville Bank and Trust Company**. In 1917, a new two-story building was constructed to replace the much smaller frame building that was located just down the street. Then on January 3, 1927, the bank became a national bank and was renamed the **Second National Bank of Paintsville**.

After a few more years, the bank became the principal bank of Paintsville and Johnson County. So on June 30, 1959, to celebrate being the oldest continuously operating and most popular bank in the county, they decided to change the bank's name to Citizens National Bank. One year later on February 15, a new location was opened on the corner of Broadway and Tenth Street. This location was called The Motor Bank Branch because it was the first branch location to have a drive-thru. Then on March 29, 1971, the bank built the Family Banking Center adjacent to the Motor Bank.

Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Citizens National Bank began to expand rapidly. So to meet the needs of their customers, they opened the Mayo Plaza Branch on November 15, 1978, and the Village Plaza Branch on August 7, 1982. In the latter part of 1982, Citizens National Corporation was created to serve as the holding company of the bank. Then on December 11, 1985, the corporation sold two million dollars in Industrial Revenue Bonds to erect a new main office building next to the Family Banking Center. On January 17, 1988, the new four-story main office building opened and shortly afterwards the no longer needed Motor Bank was torn down.

In the past decade, Citizens National Bank has merged with three other banks: The Bank Josephine, Heritage Bank of Ashland, and Kentucky National Bank. Currently, there are 17 locations in Boyd, Carter, Fayette, Floyd, Greenup, Johnson, Magoffin and Pike Counties in Kentucky.
