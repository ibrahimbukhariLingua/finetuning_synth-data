# Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland



The **Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland** is the Cleveland-based headquarters of the U.S. Federal Reserve System's Fourth District. The district is composed of Ohio, western Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. It has branch offices in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The check processing center in Columbus, Ohio, was closed in 2005. Since August 21, 2024, Beth M. Hammack has been serving as the bank's chief executive officer and president.

The bank building is a 13-story 203 foot high-rise, located at Superior Avenue and East 6th Street in downtown Cleveland. It was designed by the Cleveland firm of Walker and Weeks and completed in 1923. Its exterior architecture emulates an Italian Renaissance palazzo, and is clad in Georgia pink marble. An extension to the building designed by HOK was completed in 1998, providing new facilities for check processing and cash handling. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The building's entrances feature allegorical sculptures by Henry Hering representing *Security* and *Integrity* flanking the East Sixth Street entrance, while his *Energy* watches the Superior Avenue entry.

Its original 100 short tons (91 t) bank vault door is the largest in the world and was designed by Frederick S. Holmes. The door casting itself was 20 short tons (18 t).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It incorporates the largest hinge ever built. The hinge has an overall height of 19 feet (5.8 m) and weighs over 47 short tons (43 t) fully assembled. The vault's use was discontinued in 1997, though it is preserved intact for posterity.


## Learning Center and Money Museum

In January 2006, the bank opened the **Learning Center and Money Museum**, replacing the public teller windows vacated after September 11, 2001. Over 30 hands-on exhibits focus on the history of money, its effects on societies and cultures, and its central role in peoples' lives. The museum is open from Monday through Thursday, except for bank holidays, and admission is free.

The museum includes a variety of activities and multi-media experiences to educate visitors, including computerized games about trading, writing contests, crayon rubbings, videos, speeches, films, and virtual tours, One recent addition to the Learning Center and Money Museum is the documentary titled "The Panic of 1907" which details how the panic led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System. This film was produced by Joseph G. Haubrich and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
