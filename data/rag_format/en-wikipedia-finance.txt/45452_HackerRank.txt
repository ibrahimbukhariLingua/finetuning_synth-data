# HackerRank



**HackerRank** is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses. Developers compete by writing programs according to provided specifications. HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, and JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains.

HackerRank categorizes most of their programming challenges into a number of core computer science domains, including database management, mathematics, and artificial intelligence.

When a programmer submits a solution to a programming challenge, their submission is scored on the accuracy of their output. Programmers are then ranked globally on the HackerRank leaderboard and earn badges based on their accomplishments, which is intended to drive competition among users. In addition to individual coding challenges, HackerRank also hosts contests (often referred to by HackerRank as "CodeSprints") where users compete on the same programming challenges during a set period of time and are then ranked at the conclusion of the event. HackerRank is part of the growing gamification trend within competitive computer programming. The consumer side of their website is free for coders to use.

## HackerRank for Work

Their enterprise-side product, HackerRank for Work, is a subscription service that aims to help companies source, screen (CodePair), and hire engineers and other technical employees. The product is intended to allow technical recruiters to use programming challenges to test candidates on their specific programming skills and better understand their qualification for a certain role. Candidate's challenges, once submitted, are auto-scored and the results are then provided to the technical recruiter for review. In addition to screening, HackerRank also hosts programming hackathons, referred to as CodeSprints, as a way for companies to source technical candidates. HackerRank’s customers include Yahoo!, Quora, and Amazon.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
