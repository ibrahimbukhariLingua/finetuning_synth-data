## History

The New Economic School was founded by Valery Makarov (Russian: Валерий Леонидович Макаров, director of the Central Economic Mathematical Institute (CEMI) and Gur Ofer, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1992. The initial funding was provided by the Russian government and Western foundations focused on developing education in Russia. As the idea was to provide Russian students, already well-trained in mathematics and statistics, with access to world-class education in economics, the NES teaching was set to be a 2-year full-time master-level program with a curriculum modeled on the first two years of PhD programs in top US and UK universities.

The first class that started their study in the Fall of 1992 was a mix of graduates and senior students from top math or math economics departments in Moscow. Core teaching in mathematics and statistics was done by CEMI mathematicians Vladimir Danilov, Vladimir Levin, Fedor Zak, Vladimir Rotar, and others. For core teaching in economics, econometrics, and finance NES relied on visiting professors and advisors, which included Zvi Griliches, Don Patinkin, Andreu Mas-Colell, Bronwyn Hall, Ben Bental, Elhanan Ben-Porath, Michael Ellman, Itzhak Zilcha, Thomas Sjostrom, Brigitte Granville, Avner Bar-Ilan, James Leitzel, Daniel Kahn, Leonid Polishchuk, Judith Shapiro, and many others. A critical leadership role was played, in addition to Makarov and Ofer, by Penn State professor Barry Ickes; key local administrators included Zarema Kasabieva, Alexander Friedman, Valentina Krupina, and Oxana Budjko.

In 1998, NES launched an initiative to build a local faculty, with hiring and promotion decisions at the tenure track and tenure level in accord with international standards. Initially, a subcommittee of the International Advisory Board played the role of the department faculty meeting, with local faculty being added as soon as they were granted tenure. The initiative started with hiring Sergey Guriyev (PhD, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology) in 1999, Stanislav Anatolyev (NES'95, PhD University of Wisconsin), and Kirill Sosunov (NES'96, PhD Australian National University) in 2000, and Konstantin Sonin (NES'98, PhD Moscow State University) and Oleg Zamulin (PhD, University of Michigan) in 2001. The first tenure was granted to Guriev in 2003, followed by that to Ekaterina Zhuravskaya (NES'94, PhD Harvard) in 2005, Anatolyev in 2007, and Sonin in 2008.


## Campus

In 2014, NES moved to a new campus in Skolkovo, built for the purposes of academic life, and combining modern auditoria with sports and recreation facilities.
