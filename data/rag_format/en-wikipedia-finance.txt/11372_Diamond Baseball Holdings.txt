Diamond Baseball Holdings


# Diamond Baseball Holdings



**Diamond Baseball Holdings** (DBH) is an American sports ownership and management group that operates over 40 Minor League Baseball (MiLB) teams in the United States and Canada. DBH was established in 2021 by media conglomerate Endeavor and is a subsidiary of the investment firm Silver Lake.


## History

Established in 2021 by media conglomerate Endeavor, the organization originally was the owner and operator of nine MiLB clubs. In 2022, ownership of DBH shifted from Endeavor to Silver Lake, parent company of Endeavor, who purchased DBH for $280 million.

As of March 2024, DBH has received more than $275 million in tax preferences for MiLB teams that they own.

The company is headed by Pat Battle, who formerly headed Collegiate Licensing Company, responsible for licensing the rights to college athletic team apparel and merchandise, and IMG College. Battle and CEO Peter Freund convinced Major League Baseball that increased professionalization and consolidated ownership of minor league baseball, with sharing of best practices and cross-investment, was best for MLB teams. The goal is for the company to reach the current MLB limit of 50 teams. In addition to gate revenue, the company also plans to pursue mixed-use development on stadium parking lots; increase the number of non-game events such as concerts, weddings, and corporate events; and consolidate sponsorship, advertising, and back-office activities to a national marketplace.
