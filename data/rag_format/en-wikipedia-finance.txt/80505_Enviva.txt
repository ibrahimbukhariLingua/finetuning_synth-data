# Enviva



**Enviva Inc.** is the world's largest producer of wood pellets used for energy production. The company has been the subject of controversy regarding its sustainability with an environmental group's analysis suggesting Enviva is responsible for 50 acres a day of clear-cut land and significantly increased CO₂ production compared to coal per megawatt-hour.

Enviva was founded in 2004, conducted an initial public offering in 2015, and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under EVA.

Enviva has five corporate offices worldwide, operates nine pellet plants in six states of the Southeast United States, employs 1,200 associates, and ships wood pellets worldwide from five terminal facilities in the United States.

On March 13, 2024, Enviva declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
