# BDA China Limited



**BDA China Limited** (**BDA**) is a business advising firm based in the city of Beijing, China.


## History

Founded in 1994, BDA serves financial institutions, mostly private equity firms and hedge funds, and multinational corporations. BDA advises on investments principally in China, as well as South East Asia, Japan and South Korea.

The company's sector focus is principally China's digital markets and consumer goods and services. Other sectors include advanced manufacturing, healthcare, education & training.

After serving exclusively Morgan Stanley and its clients from 1994 to 1995, BDA built its own stable of clients including telecom, media and technology companies seeking to benefit from the rapid growth in China.

In 1999, BDA co-published a report entitled “The Internet in China”. The publication coincided with a surge in venture capital investment in the country's budding internet sector culminating in the IPOs on Nasdaq in 2000 of Chinese Internet portals Sina, Netease and Sohu. BDA founder Duncan Clark co-authored a chapter in the textbook *Chinese Cyberspace: Technological changes and political effects* based on the findings from this report.

In 2003 China's three listed Internet portals started to see a reversal of fortunes from revenues generated by mobile text messaging partnerships with Chinese telecom operators, including China Mobile. BDA research highlighted the resurgence of these companies, winning it new mandates from institutional investors including hedge funds. A new wave of private equity activity followed with the emergence of a ’second wave’ of Internet companies such as Ctrip, Baidu and Shanda, that listed successfully in the US in 2003 and 2004.

By 2004, BDA diversified its investments and business consulting practices beyond the telecommunications and internet sectors to include e-commerce and a wide range of consumer goods and services.

BDA was also an angel investor in website software start-up Exoweb limited, which subsequently spun off the mobile games company Happylatte and mobile metrics company App Annie.
