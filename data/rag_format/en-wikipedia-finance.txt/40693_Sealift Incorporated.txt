## History

Originally a shipbrokerage house specializing in paper, rice, and general cargo, Sealift Inc operated breakbulk liner services to the Mediterranean and from Brazil. The company currently operates a fleet of twelve U.S.-Flag, ocean-going and is one of the largest ocean transportation contractors for U.S. Government Food Aid cargoes.

Sealift Inc. is one of the largest ocean contractors for transporting U.S. food aid and participates in the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement. This program, also known as VISA, supplies the Pentagon with private cargo vessels which it can use to support "contingency deployments." The program saves the government the cost of maintaining a large fleet that would be idle in peacetime. In 2003, the company was awarded an emergency three-month, $4 million contract from USAID to provide freight service to Iraq.

Between the beginning of fiscal year 2000 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Sealift Inc. was awarded US$ 402.15 million in 207 separate transactions. $355.69 million was allocated from the Department of the Navy, $24.61 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and $21.85 million from the Department of the Army.
