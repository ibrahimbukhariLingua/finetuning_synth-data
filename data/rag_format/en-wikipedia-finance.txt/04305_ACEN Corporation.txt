## History

In 2011, ACEN made initial investments in the power sector in the Philippines—an investment in a wind farm at Ilocos Norte with a net capacity of 52MW (Northwind Project), a stake in a CFB thermal power plant in Batangas province with two 122MW capacity (SLTEC), a second wind farm in Ilocos Norte with net capacity of 81MW (North Luzon Renewables), a limited partnership in a coal-fired plant at Bataan and Lanao del Norte with a capacity of two 316MW (GNPower Mariveles) and four 138MW (GNPower Kauswagan) respectively, and a limited partnership in two 668MW supercritical coal-fired power plant also in Bataan (GNPower Dinginin).

In 2015, it invested in the development, construction and operation of a solar power farm in Bais, Negros Oriental or the Montesol project.

ACEN obtained a Retail Electricity Supplier's (RES) license in September 2016 so that it could sell electricity to end users in the competitive market. It entered into different agreements with various customers and end-users for the supply of over 100MW.

ACEN started to invest in different countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

In Indonesia, 2017, ACEN established its first footprint outside the Philippines in renewable energy projects with consortium of Star Energy group and Thailand's Electricity Generating Company (EGCO) which acquired the Salak and Darajat geothermal projects in West Java, Indonesia with combined capacity of 637MW of steam and power. A year after, in 2018, the Sidrap wind project is AC Energy's first greenfield project offshore and is the first utility-scale wind farm in Indonesia with net capacity of 75MW.

In December 2017 at Vietnam, entered into a joint venture with AMI Renewables Energy for New Energy Investments Corporation for investments with Khanh Hoa Solar Power Plant with 50MW of capacity in Khanh Hoa, BMT Dak Lak solar farm with 30MW capacity in Dak Lak province, and in B&T Windfarm which entered into an agreement with Quang Binh province for the development of up to 200MW wind farm. The Khanh Hoa and Dak Lak solar farms were inaugurated in May and April 2019, respectively.

In April 2018, with Jetfly Asia, entered into an agreement for acquisition of the 25 percent interest in The Blue Circle as well as co-investment rights in its projects in Southeast Asia.

In May 2018, entered the Australian renewable energy market through a joint venture with UPC Renewables. Through its international subsidiary, invested US$30 million for 50 percent ownership in UPC-AC Energy Renewables Australia. ACEN also extended a US$200 million revolver facility to partially fund Australian projects including the New England Solar Farm in Uralla, New South Wales with an expected net capacity of 700MW. UPC-AC Energy Renewables Australia is also developing wind farms on Robbins Island and Jim's Plain, North West Tasmania with a targeted net capacity of up to 1,000MW.

In June 2018, entered a partnership with the BIM Group of Vietnam for the development of an aggregate of 330MW of solar power plants located in the province of Ninh Thuan.

In May 2019, in partnership with The Blue Circle, jointly construct, own and operate the Mui Ne Wind Farm located at Binh Thuan province of Vietnam—first phase of construction for 40MW with potential expansion of up to 170MW capacity.

In June 2019, completed the acquisition of a 51.48 percent stake in PHINMA Energy with its purchase of secondary shares, growing to 66.34 percent of ownership. PHINMA Energy was renamed as AC Energy Philippines. It was officially renamed to ACEN in 2022, following the integration of the company's international and Philippine business.

In November 2019, partnered with Yoma Strategic for a joint venture with Yoma Micro Power to develop around 200MW of additional renewable energy projects within Myanmar including participation in large utility scale renewable projects.

On March 10, 2024, ACEN Group chief investment officer Patrice Clausse and BrightNight CEO, Martin Hermann, in a 50/50 joint venture invested $1.2 billion in building a 1-gigawatt renewable power focusing on large-scale hybrid wind-solar projects until 2029.

On April 28, 2024, Jaime Z. Urquijo, the 35-year-old son of heiress Bea Zobel Jr. had been elected ACEN Director along with Gerardo C. Ablaza, replacing Delfin Lazaro, husband of Cheche Lazaro and Jose Rene Almendras.
