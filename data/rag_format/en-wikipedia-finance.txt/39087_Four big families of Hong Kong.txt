Four big families of Hong Kong


# Four big families of Hong Kong



The **four big families of Hong Kong** (Chinese: 香港四大家族)ⁿᵒᵗ ˢᵖᵉᶜⁱᶠⁱᶜ ᵉⁿᵒᵘᵍʰ ᵗᵒ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠʸ is a term used to describe the four business families that historically rose to prominence and became influential in Hong Kong. In order of influence, they are the Li, Ho, Lo and Hui families.

The founders of the original four families are Li Sek-peng (李石朋), Robert Ho Tung (何東), Hui Oi-chow (許愛周) and Lo Cheung-shiu (羅長肇). Of these families, the Lis and the Hos and their descendants are the two most recognized by regular Hong Kong citizens today.

## Other definitions

Victor Wan-tai Zheng, co-author of *Grand Old Man of Hong Kong: Sir Robert Ho Tung* (2007) and *Opium King: Lee Hysan* (2011), lists 10 "Wealthy Chinese Family Busineses [*sic*] in Hong Kong" in his PhD thesis: Ho Tung Family, Li Shek-pang Family, Fung Pak-liu Family (note: 馮柏燎, co-founder of Li & Fung), Lee Leung-yick Family (note: father of Lee Hysan), Chau Wing-tai Family, Hui Oi-chow Family, Cheung Chuk-shan [zh] Family, Kowk [*sic*] (Wing On) Family, Fung Ping-shan [zh] Family and Tang Chi-ngong [zh] Family.⁵²–⁶²

He also lists a number of families, including Wang Lo Kat [*sic*] (Wong Lo Kat) and Lee Kam Kee [*sic*] (Lee Kum Kee), in a separate category.⁴⁶–⁵² The thesis was later modified and published as *Chinese Family Business and the Equal Inheritance System: Unravelling the Myth* in 2010.

Other authors have suggested new Four big families for the post colonial era. In this case, there are many more variants, including the Li Ka-shing, Kwok Tak-seng, Lee Shau-kee and Cheng Yu-tung families or the Tung Chee-hwa, James Tien, Henry Tang and Rong Yiren families.

Some scholars have gone even further by widening it to include the "big 10 families": Li Ka-shing family, Swire family, Keswick family, Kwok Tak-seng family, Pao Yue-kong family, Kadoorie family, Lee Shau-kee family, Cheng Yu-tung family, Chan Tseng-Hsi family and Ng Teng Fong family.

Most of the latter members have been associated with the term "real estate tycoons" (Chinese: 地產霸權; lit. 'property/real estate hegemony'), a label made popular by Alice Poon's book *Land and the Ruling Class in Hong Kong*. In her book, she lists the Lis [Ka-shing], the Kwoks [Tak-seng], the Lees [Shau-kee], the Chengs [Yu-tung], the Paos [Yue-kong] and Woos [Peter] and the Kadoories as the powerful Hong Kong families who hold sway over local "property-cum-utility/public services conglomerates". The Chinese translation of the book uses 香港六大家族; 'Hong Kong "big 6" families' as a section title.

As of 2018, Li Ka-shing and Lee Shau-kee were ranked first and second in *Forbes' Hong Kong's 50 Richest* respectively, while Thomas and Raymond Kwok brothers, sons of the late Kwok Tak-seng, were ranked 4th; their eldest brother, Walter Kwok (d. 20 October 2018), was ranked 10th. Richard Li, the younger son of Li Ka-shing, was ranked 19th. Henry Cheng, son of the late Cheng Yu-tung, was ranked 49th. Some of the members of the aforementioned "new" families were also on the list, such as Peter Woo, son-in-law of the late Pao Yue-kong (6th), Michael Kadoorie (12th), the brothers Tung Chee-hwa and Chee-chen (17th) and Chan Tan Ching-fen, widow of Chan Tseng-His [*sic*] (35th).
