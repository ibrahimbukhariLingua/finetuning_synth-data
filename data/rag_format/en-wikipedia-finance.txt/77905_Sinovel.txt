## Controversies

The firm was accused of stealing software from AMSC and was sued by the company. On 27 June 2013, the United States Department of Justice charged Sinovel and three individuals with theft of trade secrets. On 24 January 2018 a U.S. federal jury in Madison, Wisconsin found Sinovel guilty of stealing trade secrets from AMSC causing the American company to lose over US$800 million. The jury found that Sinovel stole trade secrets and copyrighted information with the intention of building its own versions of AMSC systems and retrofit previously built wind turbines so it could avoid having to pay AMSC for its technology. According to a press release by AMSC on 3 July 2018, AMSC has settled the lawsuit with Sinovel.
