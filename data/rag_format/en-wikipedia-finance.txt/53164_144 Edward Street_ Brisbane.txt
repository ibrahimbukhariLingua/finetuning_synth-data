## History

In the late 1970s, National Mutual appointed Conrad Gargett & Partners Architects, Connell Hagenbach structural engineers and Norman Disney & Young building services engineers, to design the tower in the late 20th century International Style and named it the National Mutual Centre upon completion in 1980. Then, National Mutual moved to 144 Edward Street during the height of the battle between National Mutual and AMP for dominance of the Australian life insurance market. In 1999, Axa took control of the National Mutual Centre [1][2] and renamed it Axa Asia Pacific. As a result, the tower became the Axa Australia Centre in Brisbane.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ Three years later, Deutsche Diversified Trust (DDT) acquired the building as part of the Deutsche Bank's acquisition of Axa Asia Pacific's property funds management enterprise in 2001. Finally, Precision Group purchased the tower from DDT for $44.65 million in 2002.
