# One More Payment



"**One More Payment**" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Clint Black. It was released in April 1991 as the third single from his (Clint Black) album *Put Yourself in My Shoes*. The song peaked at both number 7 on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and the Canadian *RPM* Country Tracks chart. It was written by Black with Hayden Nicholas and Shake Russell.


## Critical reception

An uncredited review in *Time* called it "a classic hard-times complaint about the rent, the banker at the door, and a roof that is crumbling". *The Orlando Sentinel* called it "a humorous workingman's lament about such everyday woes as high rent and car trouble. The arrangement is high-siprited Texas swing, but the song has a dark undertone with double-edged lines such as 'Well, I haven't bought the farm yet, but I'm not that far behind.'" The song has a western swing accompaniment.
