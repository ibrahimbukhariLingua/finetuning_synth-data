Exclusive economic zone of Thailand


# Exclusive economic zone of Thailand



Thailand has the world's 64th largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), with an area of 299,397 km² (115,598 sq mi). It claims an EEZ of 200 nmi (370.4 km; 230.2 mi) from its shores, which has long coastlines with the Andaman Sea and Strait of Malacca to the west and the Gulf of Thailand to the east, although all of its EEZ is limited by maritime boundaries with neighbouring countries.

Thailand's western sea territory stretches from the west coast of southern Thailand in the Andaman Sea and the Strait of Malacca. It shares treaty-defined maritime boundaries with Myanmar, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India, Indonesia and Malaysia.


## Disputes

Thailand has not established agreements with Cambodia and Vietnam, who also have maritime territory in the Gulf of Thailand, leading to conflicts. It also has not established a treaty with Malaysia on their gulf waters; however, the Malaysia–Thailand joint development area was established for both countries to jointly exploit the resources in the area of their overlapping claims.
