# Fukuyama Transporting



**Fukuyama Transporting** (福山通運, *Fukuyama tsūun*) is a Kintetsu Group shipping company whose headquarters is in Higashi-Fukatsucho, Fukuyama, Hiroshima. It is listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It is in a joint partnership with Hitachi Transport System [ja], and deals in parcel shipping and moving.


## Overview

It was founded as **Fukuyama Freight Transport Co., Ltd.** (福山貨物運送) in 1948 in Fukuyama, Hiroshima when a shipping company that closed down transferred the facilities of its Fukuyama branch office to the new company. The founder and company president was Noboru Shibuya, who also founded Shibuya Group (渋谷組), which later became Fukuyama Real Estate (福山地所), and is now Vessel [ja]. In 1950, after expanding into transportation services based out of Fukuyama Station, the company name was changed to Fukuyama Transporting, Co., Ltd. It was listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. After founding the company, Noboru Shibuya spent 22 years until his death growing it into a shipping company with a network all over Japan. In 1960 it partnered with and came under the umbrella of Kintetsu Railway.

The company's double circle badge means "trucks ascending with the Sun", and the left and right arrows mean "routes and operations always developing". The green lines painted on the trucks mean "youth" and the red ones mean "burning passion".

Fundamentally they handle corporate packages, and they have been operating a Japan-wide delivery service called "Parcel One" since January 2001 that is cheaper than regular express delivery services (as of February 27, 2015 the Parcel One service is limited to corporate bodies).
