## History

In 1958, Henry Sy Sr. started his first company, ShoeMart (SM), a small shoe store in Carriedo, Manila, Philippines. He initially focused on buying large supplies of shoes from the United States. His business expanded as he transformed his shoe store into a department store.

At this point, Sy set up his second company, SM Department Store Inc., and began selling stocks to department stores. In 1978, he began buying supermarkets at the northern end of EDSA in Quezon City. During the 90s when he opened SM Megamall, his companies were listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange, SM Prime Holdings Inc. By 2005, the SM Investments Corporation was inaugurated.

In April 2017, SMIC appointed Jose Sio as CEO.
