### Andreessen Horowitz

Dixon became an early advocate for investments in Bitcoin, which he championed in various blog posts that became "something of a gospel among young crypto entrepreneurs." By 2014, Andreessen Horowitz had invested almost $50 million into Bitcoin-related endeavors such as the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. In 2022, Fortune called Dixon "the world's top crypto investor." In an October 2022 article titled "Andreessen Horowitz Went All In on Crypto at the Worst Possible Time", the Wall Street Journal reported that during the first half of 2022, the cryptocurrency fund founded by Dixon at Andreessen Horowitz had lost around 40% of its value, a decline "much larger than the 10% to 20% drops recorded by other venture funds, which have largely avoided the risky practice of purchasing volatile cryptocurrencies."

With Dixon as a General Partner overseeing his firm's crypto investments, in October 2022 he announced a new accelerator program to support crypto startups in Los Angeles.

Dixon also led the firm's investment and sits on the board of Oculus VR.
