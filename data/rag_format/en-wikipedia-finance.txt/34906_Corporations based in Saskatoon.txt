# Corporations based in Saskatoon



The Economy of Saskatoon is quite diverse. The city hosts the head-offices for several companies. Various grains, livestock, oil and gas, potash, uranium, wood and their spin off industries fuel the economy. The world's largest publicly traded uranium company, Cameco, and the world's largest potash producer, Nutrien, have corporate headquarters in Saskatoon. Nearly two-thirds of the world's recoverable potash reserves are located in the Saskatoon region.
