# Evening economy



In planning, the **evening economy** describes economic activity taking place in the evening after many people finish daytime employment or formal education, such as eating and drinking, entertainment, and nightlife (which may be described by the related term **nighttime economy**).


## Activities

* Eating out - restaurants, cafes, takeaways
* Drinking - pubs and bars
* Culture and entertainment - theatres, cinemas, live music and comedy events, ten pin bowling, ice skating
* Sport - spectator sports including football, rugby and greyhound racing often take place in the evening, especially during Mondays to Fridays.
* Healthcare, police and firefighting

## Benefits and drawbacks

The benefits of a significant evening economy can include:

* Recreation for people, which is often welcome after finishing work for the day
* Increased employment due to local spending
* Reduced social exclusion and increased vitality in towns

The drawbacks can include:
