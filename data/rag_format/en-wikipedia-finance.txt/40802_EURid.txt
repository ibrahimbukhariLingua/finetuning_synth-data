# EURid



**EURid vzw** (European Registry for Internet Domains) is the nonprofit organisation appointed by the European Commission as the domain name registry that operates the .eu top-level domain and its variants in other scripts – .ею (.eu in Cyrillic) as of 1 June 2016, .ευ (in Greek) as of 14 November 2019.


## Operations

Established in Belgium, with its headquarters located in Diegem, EURid is a consortium of two European ccTLD operators: DNS Belgium (.be) and IIT-CNR (.it). In May 2003 the Commission designated it as the .eu domain name registry. In October 2006, EURid opened their first branch office in Stockholm. Two further branch offices were opened in Italy and the Czech Republic since then.

EURid uses the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) which enables registrars to perform operations on .eu domain names directly.

EURid's website is available in the 24 official languages of the European Union.
