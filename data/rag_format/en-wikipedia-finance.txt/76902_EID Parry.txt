# EID Parry



**EID Parry Limited** is an Indian public company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of sugar and bio-products, headquartered in Chennai. EID Parry has been in business since 1788, making it the oldest surviving mercantile name in Chennai. It has many firsts to its credit, including the manufacturing of fertilizers (1906) for the first time in the Indian subcontinent.


## Origin and history

EID Parry is one of the oldest business entities of the Indian subcontinent and was originated by Thomas Parry, a Welshman who came to India in the late 1780s. On 17 July 1788, he started a business of banking and piece goods.

By 1819, a partnership firm named "Parry and Dare" Company was founded by Thomas Parry and John William Dare. Parry's Corner, one of the most prominent central business districts of Chennai, derives its name from Parry. Over a period of time, the business established by Parry continued to grow, and its flagship company EID Parry emerged.

In 1908 Parry & Company set-up ‘The Pottery’ unit in Ranipettai. Over the years it was named as "Parryware".

Parry & Company Limited and East India Distilleries & Sugars Limited were merged to form EID Parry India Limited. In its more than 200-year existence, this house remained active and operated many businesses.

The Murugappa Group took over EID Parry in 1981 from financial & public institutions such as Life Insurance Corporation Of India, United Assurance Co, and Unit Trust of India.


## Businesses


### Sugar

EID Parry set up India's first sugar plant at Nellikuppam in 1842. It was India's first private sector company to perform Research & Development. The sugar division contributes to over 65% of EID Parry's turnover, and around 20% of the sugar production in Tamil Nadu is from EID. The Nellikuppam Integrated Sugar Complex has a crushing capacity of 6500 metric tonnes per day, its co-generation facilities produce 24.5 MW of power, and its distillery facilities produce 75 kilolitres per day. The Travancore Sugars & Chemicals Ltd. (TSCL) at Valanjavattom Thiruvalla the Sugar division, Distillery division and Blending & Bottling division was originally owned by M/s Parry & Co. Government of Kerala (GOK) took over the company in 1974.

EID Parry has 7 plants in the country situated at Nellikuppam in Cuddalore district, Pugalur in Karur district, Kurumbur in Pudukottai district, Pettavaithalai in Trichy district, Pondicherry in Puducherry, Haliyal in Karnataka and Sankili in Andhra Pradesh. The combined crushing capacity of all seven plants is 32,500 (TCD) Metric Tonnes of cane per day.

The Pudukottai unit of EID Parry was built at a site that had been rejected as a factory site at the request of the Indian government. It became one of the firm's largest revenue generators.

The Pugalur unit was acquired by EID Parry in 1992. The co-generation facilities at Pugalur can produce 22.5 MW of power, and it has a cane crushing capacity of 4000 metric tonnes per day.

Recently, EID Parry acquired the sugar plants of GMR Group in states like Karnataka and Andhra. The plants at Haliyal and Sankili were merged with EID Parry on 1 April 2012, and the plant at Ramdurg in Karnataka is operated on a lease basis.
