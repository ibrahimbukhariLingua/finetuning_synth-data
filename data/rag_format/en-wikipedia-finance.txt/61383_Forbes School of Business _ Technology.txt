# Forbes School of Business & Technology



The **Forbes School of Business & Technology**, also known as FSBT and Forbes Business School, is an online business school within The University of Arizona Global Campus. It offers degree programs at bachelor's and master's levels in business administration and information technology.


## History

The Forbes School of Business, originally created by Michael K. Clifford, was formed in 2013 after Ashford University announced an alliance with Forbes Media. Under the terms of the alliance, Ashford's College of Business & Professional studies was renamed as the Forbes School of Business. Students of the college gained free premium access to *Forbes* online content and Ashford's Distinguished Lecturer Series, where Steve Forbes and MBA Program Chair Diane Hamilton made frequent appearances. The school, since its inception, had a goal towards "retaining the strong brand recognition that comes with the Forbes name, while maintaining a clear and direct connection under Ashford University." The school has never received official endorsements from Forbes directly.

In 2016, the school changed its name from the Forbes School of Business to the Forbes School of Business & Technology, offering internet technology degrees. A year later, the Forbes School of Business & Technology received a special accreditation from the International Accreditation Council for Business Education (IACBE) to offer accounting degrees. The same year, the Forbes School of Business & Technology would name the biomedical company Nano LiquiTec as having the "Best Business Idea [for] 2017."

The Forbes School of Business & Technology announced in April 2019 that it would offer new Bachelor's programs in cyber security and mobile app technology. These technology degree programs are the only Bachelor and Master of Science offerings in the entire school. To date, the school offers 31 degree programs.

In late 2019, the school announced that the book *Cracking the Curiosity Code,* written by former MBA Program Chair Diane Hamilton, would be adopted across the school's Master of Human Resources (MAHR) curriculum. Hamilton's assessment called the 'Curiosity Code Index' was also implemented in the MAHR curriculum, which measured traits which impacted curiosity. Katy Thiry, the school's HR Program Chair justified the implementations, writing "Dr. Hamilton's work can add value to students by supporting the development of marketable skills which lead to long-term career success." FBST Curriculum Developer Chitra Anand also made her book, *The Greenhouse Approach: Cultivating Intrapreneurship in Companies and Organization*s**,** required reading throughout the school's MBA program.
