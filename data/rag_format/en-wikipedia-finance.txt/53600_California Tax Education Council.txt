California Tax Education Council


# California Tax Education Council



The **California Tax Education Council (CTEC)** is a private nonprofit quasi-public benefit organization that is mandated by the State of California. CTEC is responsible for providing a list of its approved tax education providers and verifying nonexempt tax preparers have met the state’s minimum requirements to prepare tax returns for a fee.

The responsibility for approving tax schools was transferred from the California Department of Consumer Affairs to CTEC by the California State Legislature and Governor, effective July 1, 1997.


## Summary

In 1996, the California State Legislature passed the Tax Preparers Act in an effort to help protect taxpayers against fraudulent and incompetent tax preparers.

A tax preparer is defined as “a person who, for a fee, assists with or prepares tax returns for another person or who assumes final responsibility for completed work on a return on which preliminary work has been done by another person, or who holds himself or herself out as offering those services.”

A tax return is defined as “a return, declaration, statement, refund claim, or other document required to be made or filed in connection with state or federal income taxes or state bank and corporation franchise taxes.”

The Tax Preparers Act requires anyone (excluding attorneys, certified public accountants and enrolled agents) who prepares or assists with preparing federal and state tax returns for a fee to register with CTEC. All CTEC Registered Tax Preparers (CRTPs) must complete tax education courses each year and maintain a $5,000 surety bond to protect clients against fraud.

Anyone caught preparing tax returns illegally may face penalties up to $5,000 from the California Franchise Tax Board, the enforcement arm of CTEC.

Applicants have 18 months from the date of completing the course to register, purchase a bond and become a CRTP. Applicants waiting longer than 18 months have to retake the 60-hour course and exam. CRTPs must renew their CTEC registration by October 31 of each year.

• Purchase a $5,000 tax preparer surety bond.

• Submit the application to CTEC and pay the $33 registration fee.

• After the information has been finalized and verified, CTEC will issue the tax preparer a Certificate of Completion and identification card showing the current year, their name and CTEC number, which always starts with an “A.”


### Renewal registration

As of 2011, more than 43,000 CRTPs registered with CTEC. Consumers can verify the status of a CRTP by visiting www.ctec.org or call CTEC toll free at 877-850-2832. Consumers can report unregistered tax preparers by filling out the Noncompliant Complaint Form through CTEC’s website. All reports are kept confidential.


## Approved education providers

In order to implement the Tax Preparers Act, CTEC developed an application process for approving individuals and tax schools as CTEC-approved education providers. Applicants must submit the all documents pertaining to becoming an education provider, including the course(s) they would like approved. CTEC policy CP-02 requires that CTEC send written notice within 120 days determining if the applicant’s course(s) have been approved or denied.

To become and maintain the status of being an approved education provider, an applicant must also:

* Have and maintain, during the application period and subsequent approval period, an established physical place of business.
* Provide an inquiry response plan for responding timely to students and CTEC.
* Have and maintain, during the application period and subsequent approval period, an established business phone during regular business hours.

Should the Curriculum Provider Standards Committee decide to suspend an education provider’s approved status or reduce its advertised education credits, the education provider must, within 14 business days, provide CTEC with a list of students affected by the suspension or reduction of credits.

Failure to abide by the above standards may terminate an education provider’s approved status.

In addition to the above requirements, all CTEC-approved education providers must submit different education courses for periodic review every three years to verify that its courses continue to meet CTEC standards and policies. A list of approved education providers can be found at www.ctec.org.
