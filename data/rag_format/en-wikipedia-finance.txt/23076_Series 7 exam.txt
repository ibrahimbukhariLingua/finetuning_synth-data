Series 7 exam


# Series 7 exam



In the United States, the **Series 7 exam**, also known as the **General Securities Representative Exam** (**GSRE**), is a test for entry-level registered representatives, that demonstrates competency to buy or sell security products such as corporate securities, municipal securities, options, direct participation programs, investment company products and variable contracts. The Series 7 is administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), an industry regulatory agency.

The Series 7 exam ensures a baseline level of proficiency for individuals starting their careers in the financial industry. It is particularly important for newly hired personnel who may lack prior exposure to finance-related subjects during their university education. Passing the Series 7 exam is often a requirement for other FINRA exams, including those related to options trading and managerial roles.


## Permitted activities

A candidate who passes the Series 7 exam is qualified for the solicitation, purchase and/or sale of all securities products, including corporate securities, municipal fund securities, options, direct participation programs, investment company products and variable contracts.

Covered activities and products include:

* public offerings and/or private placements of corporate securities (stocks and bonds),
* rights,
* warrants,
* mutual funds,
* money market funds,
* unit investment trusts (UITs),

## Eligibility

The corequisite is the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam, a change FINRA enacted in 2018. In October 2018, the 250-question Series 7 exam was replaced by the current top-off exam that is now taken in conjunction with the SIE exam (a correlative change was made to the Series 6 exam). In order to take the exam, an individual must be sponsored by a member firm of either FINRA or a self-regulatory organization (SRO). Employers will sponsor candidates as part of employment.

There is no education requirement.
