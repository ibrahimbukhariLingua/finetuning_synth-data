# Montage Hotels & Resorts



**Montage International** (or **Montage Hotels**) is a luxury hotel and resort management company founded by Alan Fuerstman and based in Irvine, California. As of 2022, it operates 14 properties in the United States and Mexico, with seven of those properties under the Montage Hotels and Resorts brand and seven under its Pendry Hotels and Resorts brand.


## History

Montage International was founded in January 2002 by Alan Fuerstman. The first major acquisition by Montage occurred in June 2002 when the company partnered with the Athens Group to purchase a development that was then known as the Laguna Beach Colony. The deal was worth $190 million, which was the highest per-room price for a hotel in the United States that year. Montage Laguna Beach was opened in 2003 and became the first hotel to bear the Montage brand. In March 2005, Montage won a municipal election that allowed them to build a new luxury hotel in the heart of Beverly Hills. Montage Beverly Hills was eventually opened in 2008. That property was later sold to the Maybourne Hotel Group.

Two years later, Montage opened its third resort, Montage Deer Valley in Park City, Utah.
Ohana Real Estate Investors — which was created by the founder and chairman of eBay, Pierre Omidyar—provided investment backing for and ownership interest in several Montage Hotels properties, including Laguna Beach, Beverly Hills, and Deer Valley. In August 2013, Montage Hotels & Resorts expanded their portfolio to Hawaii and took over management of the Kapalua Bay property and officially became "Montage Kapalua Bay."

In 2014, Montage acquired management rights to the Inn at Palmetto Bluff in Bluffton, South Carolina. In October 2014, the company launched a new lifestyle brand called Pendry Hotels and Resorts. Pendry is led by Michael Fuerstman (Alan Fuerstman's eldest son) and opened their first Pendry in San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter in February 2017. Construction crews officially broke ground on the hotel on October 8, 2014.

In January 2015, Montage Laguna Beach was sold by Ohana Real Estate Investors to Strategic Hotels & Resorts for $360 million, which is currently the state record for the highest per-room price. Montage Hotels & Resorts continues to manage the hotel. In early 2015, Montage Hotels announced plans for their first international resort hotel in Los Cabos, Mexico on the Santa Maria Bay which officially opened in 2018.

In 2020, Montage purchased Matt Lowe Cay, an island in the Bahamas, with plans to build a resort.
