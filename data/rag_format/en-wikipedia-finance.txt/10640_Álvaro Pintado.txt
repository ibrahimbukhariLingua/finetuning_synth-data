## Education and career

Álvaro Pintado was born in Sant Cugat del Vallès, Spain to middle class Spanish parents. He studied at Viaró Global School, a Catholic boys' institution in his hometown. Afterwards, he went to UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya) to study Telecommunications Engineering, but dropped out after 3 months to focus on his entrepreneurship career.

In 2022, he wrote the book *El Sistema Financiero Descentralizado* and founded hello.app, a company that has since raised over $800,000 in funding from investors such as Esade, IESE Business School, and Bcombinator, among others. Its latest valuation was $16 million.

hello.app is a decentralized storage network based on blockchain and distributed databases. The concept is to use mobile devices to act as microservers, reducing reliance on large server farms owned by a few companies. Currently, hello.app has over 100,000 beta users across more than 200 countries.

Pintado is also credited with one of the most expensive domain name purchases in Spain, having acquired www.hello.app for $115,000.
