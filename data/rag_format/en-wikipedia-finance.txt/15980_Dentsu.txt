In 2018, Dentsu announced its reorganization into a holding company and as a result, most of the company's functions (including its advertising business) moved to a new company under the Dentsu name and the existing company rebranding to the Dentsu Group name, the changes took effect by January 1, 2020.


## History

Dentsu was originally established as **Japan Advertising Ltd.** (日本広告株式会社, *Nihon Kōkoku Kabushiki-gaisha*) and **Telegraphic Service Co.** (電報通信社, *Denpō Tsūshin-sha*) by Hoshiro Mitsunagaʲᵃ. In 1906, Telegraphic Service Co. became **Japan Telegraphic Communication Co., Ltd.** (株式会社日本電報通信社, *Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Denpō Tsūshin-sha*). The next year, Japan Advertising Ltd. merged with Japan Telegraphic Communication Co., Ltd. to create advertising and communications operations. Japan Telegraphic Communication Co., Ltd. sold off its news division to Doumei News Agency in 1936 to change the company's focus to specialized advertising. In 1943, 16 companies were acquired in order to supplement Japan Telegraphic's advertising business. That same year, operational bases were established in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kyūshū. With the 1951 arrival of commercial radio broadcasting in Japan, the Radio Division was established at Japan Telegraphic's head and local offices.

In 1955, Japan Telegraphic Communication Co., Ltd. changed its name to **Dentsu Inc.** 1995 saw Dentsu creating five domestic regional subsidiaries. On December 10, 2018, Dentsu announced its intention to restructure into a holding company which would form another company under the Dentsu name handling its advertising and production divisions.


### Initial public offering

Dentsu was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2001. During the initial public offering of Dentsu, in December 2001, a trader at UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, sent an order to sell 610,000 shares in this company at ¥6 each, while he intended to sell 16 shares at ¥600,000. The bank lost £71 million.

Dentsu's sales are more than double its nearest competitor, Hakuhodo or ADK, in the Japanese market, thanks to the company's origins as a media representative during the early part of the 20th century, producing the first newspaper advertisements as well as the first television commercials in Japan.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Corporate affairs

### Dentsu Building

The Dentsu Building is a high-rise building in Shiodome, Minato, Tokyo, which houses Dentsu's corporate offices. With 48 floors that rise to 213.34 m (700 ft), it is the eleventh-tallest building in Tokyo. It was designed by Jean Nouvel, the French architect, and completed in 2002. It was built over the site of Tokyo's first railway station, and sits aside the Hamarikyu Gardens, formerly the site of a shōgun's vacation home.


### Mount Fuji climbing tradition

Since 1925, Dentsu employees have had a company tradition of climbing Mount Fuji. Every July all new staff and newly promoted executives climb Mt Fuji. Employees who are not physically able to do so are exempt. A former employee gave the reasoning behind this as: "The message is: 'We are going to conquer the one symbol that represents Japan more than anything else. And, once we do that, it will signify that we can do anything.'"


## Criticism


### Working conditions

In August 2015, Dentsu was caught exceeding its own 70-hour monthly maximum overtime limit. In December, Matsuri Takahashi, a University of Tokyo graduate and 24-year-old female employee of Dentsu, committed suicide. The Japanese government recognized her suicide as karoshi, a Japanese term for death from overworking.
In July 2017, the company was charged by Japanese authorities for the death of Takahashi. No individuals were charged, only the corporation. The company admitted allowing illegal levels of overtime and was convicted in October, paying ¥500,000 in fines.

Mr. Tadashi Ishii, Representative Director and President & CEO, notified Dentsu on December 28, 2016 that he will resign as Representative Director and President & CEO. His papers were sent to the prosecutors office because of the violation of the Labor Standards Act. Over a half century of ongoing overworking was documented by *The New York Times*, including training materials supporting a Dentsu president urging working "*even if it kills you*."

A 2017 attempt to encourage letting workers "leave the office at 3 p.m. on the last Friday of the month" did not get much participation. Also in 2017, a former executive creative director of Dentsu Japan has resigned from his own company following allegations he sexually harassed a woman during his tenure at the advertising giant.


### Bribery charges and bid rigging

In 2022, a former executive at Dentsu was arrested on suspicion of receiving bribes from sponsors of the 2020 Summer Olympics. In February 2023, Japan's competition regulator filed criminal complaints against six firms, including Dentsu, over alleged bid rigging of contracts for the games. The companies were charged under anti-monopoly law and accused of lowering the competitiveness of their tenders. The case also saw the arrest of a senior Olympic official from Japan and the head of Dentsu's sports division. The company has admitted liability. The corruption scandal has clouded the chance of landing the 2030 Winter Olympics by the city of Sapporo, an early favorite.

According to one media report, Dentsu does business with almost every major institution in Japan, accounting for about 28 percent of the national advertising budget. Its connections to the government are so tight that *The New York Times* referred to Dentsu as "the unofficial communications department of the governing Liberal Democratic Party", and it has also been likened to the CIA on account of its reach.
