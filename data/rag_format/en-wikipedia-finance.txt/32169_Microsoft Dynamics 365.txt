After Microsoft incorporated Axapta into their Business Solution suite, they transferred the newsgroup's content to the Microsoft Business Solutions newsgroup. The oldest Axapta Technet post that can be found dates to August 2000.

With the arrival of NAV 2013, Microsoft introduced a new licensing model that operated on a concurrent user basis. With this model, user licenses were of two types: A full user or a limited user. The full user has access to the entire system, whereas the limited user only has read access to the system and limited write access.

From the Business Central rebrand launch, the licensing model changed to a per-seat license model with a 3x concurrent seat multiplier added to any existing perpetual licences from previous Dynamics NAV versions. Customers with a Dynamics NAV Extended Pack license were moved to the Premium edition.


## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales

**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales** is a customer relationship management software package developed by Microsoft. The current version is Dynamics 365. The name and licensing changed with the update from Dynamics 2016. 365 Sales comes with softphone capabilities.


## History

**Microsoft Dynamics** was a line of Business Applications, containing enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). Microsoft marketed Dynamics applications through a network of reselling partners who provided specialized services. Microsoft Dynamics formed part of "Microsoft Business Solutions". Dynamics can be used with other Microsoft programs and services, such as SharePoint, Yammer, Office 365, Azure and Outlook. The Microsoft Dynamics focus-industries are retail, services, manufacturing, financial services, and the public sector. Microsoft Dynamics offers services for small, medium, and large businesses.


### Business Central

**Business Central** was first published as **Dynamics NAV** and **Navision**, which Microsoft acquired in 2002.


#### Navision

Navision originated at PC&C A/S (Personal Computing and Consulting), a company founded in Denmark in 1984. PC&C released its first accounting package, PCPlus, in 1985—a single-user application with basic accounting functionality. There followed in 1987 the first version of Navision, a client/server-based accounting application that allowed multiple users to access the system simultaneously. The success of the product prompted the company to rename itself to Navision Software A/S in 1995.

The Navision product sold primarily in Denmark until 1990. From Navision version 3 the product was distributed in other European countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom.

In 1995 the first version of Navision based on Microsoft Windows 95 was released.

In 2000, Navision Software A/S merged with fellow Danish firm Damgaard A/S (founded 1983) to form NavisionDamgaard A/S. In 2001 the company changed its name to "Navision A/S".

On July 11, 2002, Microsoft bought Navision A/S to go with its previous acquisition of Great Plains Software. Navision became a new division at Microsoft, named Microsoft Business Solutions, which also handled Microsoft CRM.

In 2003 Microsoft announced plans to develop an entirely new ERP system (Project Green). But it later decided to continue development of all ERP systems (Dynamics AX, Dynamics NAV, Dynamics GP and Dynamics SL). Microsoft launched all four ERP systems with the same new role-based user interface, SQL-based reporting and analysis, SharePoint-based portal, Pocket PC-based mobile clients and integration with Microsoft Office.


#### Dynamics NAV

In September 2005, Microsoft re-branded the product and re-released it as Microsoft Dynamics NAV.

In December 2008, Microsoft released Dynamics NAV 2009, which contains both the original "classic" client, as well as a new .NET Framework-based three-tier GUI called the RoleTailored Client (RTC).

In first quarter of 2014 NAV reached 102,000 current customers.

In 2016, Microsoft announced the creation of Dynamics 365 — a rebranding of the suite of Dynamics ERP and CRM products as a part of a new online-only offering. As a part of this suite, the successor to NAV was codenamed "Madeira".


#### Dynamics 365 Business Central

In September 2017 at the Directions conference, Microsoft announced the new codename
"Tenerife" as the next generation of the Dynamics NAV product. This replaced codename "Madeira".

On April 2, 2018, Business Central was released publicly and plans for semi-annual releases were announced.

Business Central introduced a new AL language for development and translated the codebase from Dynamics NAV (C/AL).


### Dynamics SL, Dynamics GP, Dynamics C5

Several variants of the Dynamics brand have migration paths to Business Central with most having not had a new release since 2018. The later releases of the SL, GP, and C5 products adopted the Dynamics NAV Role-Tailored Client UI which helped pave the transition to the Business Central product.

Legacy Dynamics products and their support end dates
| Product | Last major release | Support lifecycle end date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dynamics SL | 2018 | July 11, 2028 |
| Dynamics GP | 2018 R4 (Nov 2021) | January 11, 2028 |
| Dynamics C5 | 2016 | April 14, 2026 |


#### History of Dynamics C5

Dynamics C5 was developed in Denmark as the successor to the DOS-based Concorde C4. The developing company Damgaard Data merged with Navision in 2001 which was subsequently acquired by Microsoft Microsoft in 2002 rebranding the solution from Navision C5 to Microsoft Dynamics C5.

The product handles currently more than 70,000 installations in Denmark.


#### History of Dynamics SL

Based in Findlay, Ohio, Solomon's roots go back more than 35 years, when co-founders Gary Harpst, Jack Ridge and Vernon Strong started TLB, Inc. in 1980. TLB, Inc. stands for The Lord's Business, "to remind the founders why the business was started: to conduct the business according to biblical principles." TLB was later renamed Solomon Software, and then Microsoft Dynamics SL.


#### History of Dynamics GP

The Dynamics GP product was originally developed by Great Plains Software, an independent company located in Fargo, North Dakota run by Doug Burgum. Dynamics Release 1.0 was released in February 1993. It was one of the first accounting packages in the United States that were designed and written to be multi-user and to run under Windows as 32-bit software. In late 2000, Microsoft announced the purchase of Great Plains Software. This acquisition was completed in April 2001.

Dynamics GP is written in a language called Dexterity. Previous versions were compatible with Microsoft SQL Server, Pervasive PSQL, Btrieve, and earlier versions also used C-tree, although after the buyout all new versions switched entirely to Microsoft SQL Server databases.

Dynamics GP will no longer be updated after September 2029, with security updates through April 2031.


### Finance

**Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance** is a Microsoft enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for medium to large organizations. The software, part of the Dynamics 365 product line, was first on general release in November 2016, initially branded as **Dynamics 365 for Operations**. In July 2017, it was rebranded to **Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations**. At the same time, Microsoft rebranded their business software suite for small businesses (Business Edition, Financials) to **Finance and Operations, Business Edition**, however, the two applications are based on completely different platforms. Its history includes:

* 2017 – Rebranded to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise Edition (not to be mistaken with Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Business Edition, which is based on former Microsoft Dynamics NAV).

The second version was rebranded as Microsoft Dynamics 3.0 (version 2.0 was skipped entirely) to signify its inclusion within the Dynamics product family and was released on December 5, 2005.
Notable updates over version 1.2 are the ease of creating customizations to CRM, the switch from using Crystal Reports to Microsoft SQL Reporting Services, and the ability to run on Windows Vista and Outlook 2007.

You could create custom entities and (1xN) relations between the system/custom entities.


#### Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0
