## Offshore fish farming

It was towed back to a shipyard in 2022 for some improvements and repairs then returned to its original location. It uses a structure 69 meters tall & 110 meters in diameter with a volume of 250,000 cubic meters to produce around 6000 tonnes a year of salmon.

The company plans a Smart Fish Farm with a larger 22.7 tonne per year production capacity.
