The company offers online tax preparation technology for American consumers and tax professionals, allowing them to electronically file state and/or federal returns. TaxSlayer also offers business technology products and services for legal, bookkeeping and HR/payroll.

According to the National Association of Tax Professionals (NATP), TaxSlayer Pro is one of the top-rated software packages for tax professionals in the U.S. In 2015, the IRS awarded TaxSlayer with the exclusive five-year contracts for the VITA and TCE programs, which provide electronic tax preparation assistance for taxpayers who are low-income, elderly, disabled or who have limited English language proficiency in over 9,500 locations worldwide. Over 90,000 tax preparers use TaxSlayer as part of the program.

In 2010, the company built its headquarters building in Evans, Georgia, a large suburb of metro Augusta.

## History

In the early 1960s, Aubrey Rhodes, Sr. founded Rhodes-Murphy & Co., a full-service tax preparation company that remains in operation in Georgia and South Carolina. In 1989, the company formed a subsidiary, Rhodes Computer Services, to start developing tax preparation software for others to use.

Four years later, Rhodes Computer began selling taxation software known as "Taxslayer Pro" to tax preparers and accountants throughout the United States. TaxSlayer was named for the original email address of Jimmy Rhodes, son of Aubrey and the President and CEO at the time.

In 1998, the firm began developing TaxSlayer.com to market its software to individuals. TaxSlayer is now one of the largest online tax preparation services and a direct competitor to Intuit's TurboTax. In 2017, the company reported record growth in tax e-files with more than 10 million state and federal returns for the year, representing a 200% increase over the past three years.

### Consumer

TaxSlayer’s consumer products allow taxpayers to electronically file their taxes online each year. The product provides several different packages to provide varying levels of assistance and support customers require when filling.

## Government partnerships


### IRS VITA/TCE

TaxSlayer maintains a continuing partnership with the Federal VITA and TCE programs. Both programs provide tax preparation assistance to Americans who may require assistance filing. VITA provides IRS-trained tax preparers who help those who are disabled, are low income, or limited in English proficiency, while TCE provides a similar service to the elderly. Both use TaxSlayer-provided software to aid them in their work.


### Free File Alliance

In addition to their paid offerings, TaxSlayer also participates in the IRS Free File Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of industry-leading tax software companies that partnered with the IRS to help millions of Americans prepare and e-file their federal tax returns for free. By participating in this program, TaxSlayer guarantees free preparation and e-filing to taxpayers who meet a set of income criteria.
