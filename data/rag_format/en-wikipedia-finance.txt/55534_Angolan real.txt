Angolan real


# Angolan real



The **real** (plural *réis*) was the currency of Portuguese Angola until 1914. It was equal to the Portuguese real. No subdivisions existed, but some coins were issued denominated in *macutas*, worth 50 réis. The real was replaced by the escudo in 1914.


## Coins

In the mid-eighteenth century, copper coins were issued in denominations of 10, 20 and 40 réis, 1⁄4, 1⁄2 and 1 macuta, along with silver 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 macutas. From 1814, only copper 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1 and 2 macutas were issued. However, after 1814, some copper coins were counterstamped with the coat of arms of Portugal to double their value. 10, 20 and 40 réis and 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1 and 2 macuta coins were counterstamped to produce 20, 40 and 80 réis and 1⁄2, 1, 2 and 4 macuta coins. The last coins were issued in 1860.


## Banknotes

In 1861, the *Junta da Fazenda Publica da Provincia d'Angola* introduced notes in denominations of 1000, 2000, 5000 and 20,000 réis. 10,000 real notes followed in 1877, with notes issued until 1884. The *Banco Nacional Ultramarino* began issuing notes in 1865, with notes for 5000, 10,000 and 20,000 réis. In 1876, 1000 and 2500 real notes were added, followed by 2000 réis in 1877. In 1892, a shortage of small change lead to an emergency issue of 100, 200 and 500 real notes which circulated until 1905. 50,000 real notes were introduced in 1909.
