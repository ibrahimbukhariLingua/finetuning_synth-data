Timeline of carbon capture and storage


# Timeline of carbon capture and storage



The milestones for carbon capture and storage show the lack of commercial scale development and implementation of CCS over the years since the first carbon tax was imposed.

The time line of **carbon capture and storage** announcements and developments follows:
1972:
Since 1972 over 175 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) have been injected into the SACROC oil field to enhance oil recovery (EOR).


## 2023

In this year two projects among others are reported on by the ICSC in their webinar:

2. PORTHOS

## 2009


### Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute

10 July 2009 major economies forum meeting on climate change: Australian Prime minister Mr Rudd, who shared the stage with US President Barack Obama, said the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (CCS) would now be an international initiative led by Australia - which will act as a clearing house for research of new technologies, legislation to pave their path and as a vehicle to streamline funding. "The practical challenge we face...is what do we do about the problem, the challenge, of coal. There are practically no large carbon capture and storage projects under construction now," Mr Rudd said. "Australia in the last 12 months has decided to work with other major economies, and all the major energy companies, on the establishment of a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. That is what we are here launching today." He said carbon capture and storage, which captures CO₂ and seeks to inject it in safe stores deep underground, is an important potential future weapon in the battle against global warming.

Electricity sourced from fossil fuels accounts for more than 40 per cent of the world's energy-related CO₂ emissions. A further 25 per cent comes from large-scale industrial processes such as iron and steel production, cement making, natural gas processing and petroleum refining.

With world energy demand projected to grow by more than 40 per cent over the next two decades, reducing CO₂ emissions is a significant challenge the nation of Australia has a particular interest in helping to solve. Australia's is the world's biggest coal exporter, and the Australian economy is heavily dependent upon coal—its biggest export.
Renewable energy technology continues to develop, but fossil fuels, in particular coal and gas, will continue to provide the bulk of the world's energy for the foreseeable future.

However, there is a way to harness fossil fuels while significantly reducing CO₂ emissions.
The answer lies in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide and other climate influencing greenhouse gases.


### GreenGen Project led by China Huaneng Group (CHNG) will begin construction in early 2009

GreenGen Project aims to research, develop and demonstrate a coal-based power generation system with hydrogen production through coal gasification, power generation from a combined cycle gas turbine and fuel cells, and efficient treatment of pollutants and CO₂. Thus, the efficiency of the coal-based power generation will be greatly improved, and the pollutants and CO₂ emissions will be near zero.


## 2008


### Reality campaign launched

3 December 2008: This Is Reality.org, a coalition of US environmental organisations, launches a campaign to highlight that no fossil fuel power station in the USA captures other than token amounts of the greenhouse gas that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and all other significant scientific organisations acknowledge are causing climate change, global warming, Arctic shrinkage and sea level rise.


### CCS inclusion in CDM postponed

Plans to allow organizations to earn credits for CCS under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) have been dropped at the climate change talks in Poznan － the 14th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The proposal, led by Australia, was supported by a majority of representatives and the IEA but Brazil and a few other countries blocked the move. The decision will then be postponed until next year.


### Carbon assessment software developed

Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) designed a new software that will help developers of clean coal technology to accurately measure how much CO₂ they can store underground.


### BP and CAS established the Clean Energy Commercialization Center

### Clean-coal debut in Germany

The world's first coal-fired power plant designed to capture and store carbon dioxide that it produces began operations in Spremberg, Germany.
Built alongside the 1,600MW Schwarze Pumpe power plant in north Germany, the demonstration experiment will capture up to 100,000 tonnes of CO₂ a year, compress it and bury it 3,000m below the surface of the depleted Altmark gas field, about 200 km from the site.
"It's a very important and tangible step forward," said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist and CCS expert at the University of Edinburgh. "It is the first full-chain demonstration of oxyfuel as a carbon capture technology. It connects all that for the first time in a working system."


### Irish Energy Group launches carbon capture scheme

Providence Resources, an Irish oil and gas group, is launching a project that could lead to the first carbon capture & storage (CCS) scheme in the British Isles.
Providence Resources is working with Star Energy Group, a UK gas storage company owned by Petronas of Malaysia, on the Ulysses Project.
The scheme will evaluate the Kish Bank Basin in the Irish Sea to decide whether its underground saline reservoirs can be used for carbon sequestration and natural gas storage.


### New organic liquids to Capture CO₂

Carbon dioxide-binding organic liquids (CO₂BOLs) can hold more than twice as much CO₂ as current capture agents. The liquids could be used in coal power plants to capture the greenhouse gas from combustion exhaust.


### The CSIRO and its Chinese partners launched a PCC pilot plant in Beijing

The CSIRO (Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) and its Chinese partners Huaneng Group and the Thermal Power Research Institute (TPRI) have officially launched a post-combustion capture (PCC) pilot plant in Beijing that strips carbon dioxide from power station flue gases in an effort to stem climate change.

### CO₂ injection began in Weyburn

Delivery of the first CO₂ from Dakota Gasification Company to Weyburn commenced in September 2000. In late 2000, CO₂ injection was initiated at an initial injection rate of 2.69 million m3/d (or 5000 t/d) into 19 patterns.


## Before 2000


### 1998


#### EnCana announced plans to implement Weyburn EOR project

In 1998, a Canadian oil and gas corporation (the PanCanadian Petroleum Limited, now EnCana Corporation) announced plans to implement a large scale EOR project in an oilfield near Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada, using CO₂ captured from Dakota Gasification Company. The Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project provided a chance to demonstrate and study a large-scale geological storage project and to provide the data to evaluate the safety, technical and economic feasibility of such storage.


### 1997


#### DGC agreed to send all of the waste gas (96% CO₂) to the Weyburn oil field

The Weyburn oil field is situated in Canada, near the USA border. The carbon dioxide for the Weyburn EOR project is produced in the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in Beulah, North Dakota, USA, which is operated by the Dakota Gasification Company. In 1997, DGC agreed to send all of the waste gas (96% CO₂) from its Great Plains Synfuels Plant through a pipeline to the Weyburn oil field.


### 1996


#### Sleipner — a carbon dioxide storage project

The Sleipner gas field is in the North Sea, about 250 km west of Stavanger, Norway. It is operated by Norway's largest oil company Statoil. The Sleipner field produces natural gas and light oil from the Heimdal sandstones, which are about 2,500 m below sea level. The natural gas produced at Sleipner contains unusually high levels (about 9%) of carbon dioxide, but the customers require less than 2.5%. This means that the CO₂ that is stored at Sleipner is a by-product of gas purification, rather than CO₂ captured from a point source. As such, the Sleipner project is more precisely described as a carbon storage project.

To encourage companies to cut their carbon emissions, the Norwegian government imposes a carbon tax equivalent to about $50 per ton of CO₂ released into the atmosphere. To avoid paying the tax, and as a test of alternative technology, all of the CO₂ extracted since 1996, when gas production started at Sleipner, has been pumped back deep underground.
The Sleipner project is the first commercial example of CO₂ storage in a deep saline aquifer, so there is a lot of interest from around the world in its success. In particular, scientists want to know how the CO₂ moves inside the aquifer and if there is a risk that it could escape back to the surface.


### 1991


#### The Norwegian government instituted a tax on CO₂ emissions

In 1991, the Norwegian government instituted a tax on CO₂ emissions, which motivated Statoil to capture the CO₂ emitted from its Sleipner oil and gas field in the North Sea and inject it into an underground aquifer.


### 1989


#### The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT initiated

Initiated in 1989, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT conducts research into technologies to capture, utilize, and store CO₂ from large stationary sources. It is globally recognized as a leader in the field of carbon capture and storage research.


### Early 1970s


#### The use of CO₂ for commercial EOR began in US in the early 1970s.

The use of CO₂ for commercial enhanced oil recovery started in USA in the early 1970s. There are currently about 120 registered CO₂ floods worldwide, almost 85% of which are in the United States and Canada.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
