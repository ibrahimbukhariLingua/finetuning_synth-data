## Business cycle theory

The Cobden Centre espouses the Austrian Theory of the business cycle, sometimes known as "Hayek-Mises business cycle theory" after its two most famous proponents, Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises.

The Cobden Centre is named after Richard Cobden, the 19th century classical liberal who campaigned against the Corn Laws and in favour of free trade and individual liberty. The Cobden Centre has a commercial arm called Cobden Partners, which offers advice on economics from an Austrian School perspective.
