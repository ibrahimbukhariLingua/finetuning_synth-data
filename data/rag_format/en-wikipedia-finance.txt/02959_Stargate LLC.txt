Stargate LLC


# Stargate LLC



**Stargate Project**, incorporated in Delaware as **Stargate LLC**, is an American multinational artificial intelligence (AI) joint venture created by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and investment firm MGX. The venture plans on investing up to US$500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States by 2029. It has been planned since 2022 and was formally announced on January 21, 2025, by United States president Donald Trump. SoftBank's CEO Masayoshi Son is the venture's chairman.

It is named after the 1994 film Stargate, in which the stargates were portals to other worlds. Because of its large scale, the program has been compared to the Manhattan Project.


## History

The "Stargate" term dates back to 2024, when OpenAI and Microsoft started developing a $100 billion AI supercomputer.

On January 21, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the venture at a White House press conference, accompanied by Sam Altman from OpenAI, Larry Ellison from Oracle and Masayoshi Son from SoftBank.

Donald Trump called it "the largest AI infrastructure project in history", and he indicated that he would use emergency declarations to expedite the project's development, particularly regarding energy infrastructure.

Larry Ellison contended that Stargate could lead to the AI-facilitated production of mRNA vaccines against cancer, and that such vaccines could be designed "robotically", or by leveraging AI, "in about 48 hours".

The venture launched with an initial investment of $100 billion, with plans to increase it to $500 billion by 2029. Elon Musk, CEO of OpenAI's competitor xAI, said that the venture lacked the financing to meet the promised investment levels. This was later denied by Sam Altman. Arm CEO Rene Haas stated that the financial backing behind the project is "quite solid". *The Information* reported that Softbank and OpenAI have each committed $19 billion of capital to initially fund Stargate and would each hold 40% ownership interest in the joint venture, while Oracle and MGX would each contribute $7 billion, and the remaining funds would be sourced from limited partners and debt financing. According to the *Financial Times*, the infrastructure being built as part of the project will be exclusive to OpenAI.

Coinciding with the project announcement, Microsoft and OpenAI signed a new agreement that grants Microsoft a right of first refusal on future OpenAI cloud computing capacity, while allowing OpenAI to use other cloud providers if Microsoft declines.


## Structure

The venture is currently building 10 data centers in Abilene, Texas, and plans to expand to more states and countries like Japan, with Trump saying that he will use executive orders to help build the venture's infrastructure. The new venture says that it will create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States. Altman has said that SoftBank will have the "financial responsibility" of the venture and OpenAI will have the "operational responsibility". Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners.
