Commercial Solvents Corporation v Commission


# Commercial Solvents Corporation v Commission



***Commercial Solvents Corporation v Commission*** (1974) Cases 6/73 and 7/73 is an EU competition law case, concerning monopoly and abuse of a dominant position.


## Facts

Commercial Solvents Corp (also Istituto Chemioterapico Italiano SpA was being sued) ceased selling aminobutanol to Zoja, which was used to make an anti-tuberculosis drug. CSC decided to start making the drug itself, and so stopped selling to Zoja.


## Judgment

The ECJ held that CSC was dominant and abused its position.

> 25. ... an undertaking which has a dominant position in the market in raw materials and which, with the object of reserving such raw material for manufacturing its own derivatives, refuses to supply a customer, which is itself a manufacturer of these derivatives, and therefore risks eliminating all competition on the part of this customer, is abusing its dominant position.
