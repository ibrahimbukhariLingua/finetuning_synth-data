## Political persecution in Russia

In late 2000s, Danilochkin uncovered a scheme organized by highly-ranked Russian law enforcement officials to embezzle taxpayers' money. Working on the auditing teams for several Russian enterprises, Danilochkin challenged the suspects to clarify his audit findings, and was allegedly framed by them as a "fly-by-night king", who had been setting up shell companies. The group alleged to be behind the fabrication was the same group involved in the Magnitsky affair, which centered on a similar style of tax fraud, according to Russian investigative journalists and Danilochkin himself, who claims he was used as a scapegoat.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
