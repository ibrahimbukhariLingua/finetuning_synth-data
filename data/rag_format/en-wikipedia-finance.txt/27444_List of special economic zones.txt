The goal is to enable stable legal structures, physical environment, human rights, and taxation in order to encourage investment, migration, and economic development. This is the location of the private charter city of Próspera.


### Jamaica

The first of Jamaica's special economic zones was created in 1976 with the goal of industrializing the country, as well as increasing foreign exchange and access to technology.¹⁸³ This primary zone was in Kingston and was strategically attached to one of the country's main ports, to facilitate efficient transportation. Although it is no longer in use, during its years of operation, the zone consisted of 146 acres of warehouse land, which could be rented by foreign enterprises at very low rates. Private companies were invited to occupy the warehouses, but the government at that time, The People's National Party, remained tentative of relying on foreign capital as a means of industrializing.⁵⁰

With the shift to the Seaga government in the 1980s, export led industrialization became key to Jamaica's economic development, and more effort was put into attracting foreign enterprises to the zone.⁵¹ One of the ways in which this was executed, was by transforming the warehouse land into a center for production of manufactured goods.⁵¹ While the Caribbean Development Bank and the World Bank funded the creation of the zone, the conversion into factories was initiated and paid for by the National Development Bank, a government-owned institution.⁵¹ Due to the large job creation that accompanied the transformation, a second SEZ was opened in Montego Bay in 1988. The majority of the activity, however, remained at the Kingston location, with only ten percent of the factories at the new, smaller site.¹⁸⁴⁵¹ The factories were primarily occupied by foreign enterprises, and produced apparel items, fish products, fruit juice concentrates and animal feed.⁵³ As a result of the special economic zones, Jamaica's export of manufactured goods increased ten-fold between 1980 and 1984, although the export of traditional goods, namely bauxite and alumina, stagnated.⁵¹

Foreign enterprises were attracted to the SEZs by the incentives they offered.¹⁸³ The zones operated as separate entities that were not technically part of Jamaica, which allowed companies to bypass local import and exchange controls. Additionally, under the Jamaica Free Zone Act, any enterprise with approval from the Port Authority could import certain items without any customs duties.¹⁸³–¹⁸⁴ Any remaining local labour controls were of little concern to foreign companies, since Jamaican workers were typically excluded from all steps except for manufacturing. The materials used for apparel manufacturing, for example, were all imported from the United States and simply assembled by the local workers. The minimal role played by Jamaicans in the production also meant that there were very few backwards and forwards linkages. With the exception of fish products, which incorporated local resources, most of the companies imported their inputs from home or from Asia.⁵⁶ Since these enterprises could execute their business with very little engagement with the country, there was no incentive for them to ameliorate Jamaican infrastructure or industry. The Seaga government argued that despite this lack of success in industrializing the country, the zones were effective in providing much-needed employment for the locals.

At its peak, the Kingston and Montego Bay Free Zones employed over 36,000 locals. However, they were criticized for issues of poor working conditions and low wages. The jobs that the factories provided were high pressure, laborious, and provided few opportunities for workers to gain new skills. Jamaican women made up 95 percent of the workforce in the zones, the majority of whom were under 25 years old.¹⁸³–¹⁸⁴ These women typically worked twelve-hour days, six days a week, with significant overtime expected. Throughout the mid-1980s, an average income in the zone was US$30 per two weeks, a wage that was comparable to other low-skill, entry-level jobs in Jamaica, but much less than the minimum wages of the countries that owned and operated the factories. Although the creation of these jobs did lift some families out of dire economic situations, the wages were not high enough to stop the cycle of poverty for most. In addition, the government taxed their incomes heavily for ‘health benefits’, yet no aid was provided when medical issues arose. This forced many locals to believe that the government was co-conspiring with foreign countries to exploit them, but without the adequate unionized backing, there was little they could do to fight these injustices. This lack of unionization also meant that many enterprises were not forced to comply with the Factory Act: Occupational issues that arose from poor working conditions, such as overheating, carpel tunnel syndrome, strained eyesight, or back problems, went unnoticed.¹⁸⁴⁵⁷

Although the workers had a fundamental right to create or join unions, the majority of the factories in the zones remained non-unionized.¹⁹⁴ The International Labour Organization set out guidelines for ethical working conditions, but it was largely up to the Jamaican government to enforce them. Since low-wage female workers were not a priority, very little effort was made to support them. Some women did try to improve the conditions of the factories and were met with mixed success. A few factories started to provide maternity leave and some medical benefits; however, the majority remained unchanged. In response to strikes or labour movements, some companies dismissed their Jamaican workers and brought in workers from Asia who were less vocal about the injustices. This not only took jobs from the locals, one of the key goals behind creating the special economic zones, but also had deleterious effects on future movements to unionize the factories.

The creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 had significant impacts on the SEZs of Jamaica and can be seen as one of the main reasons for the closure of the Kingston site. Before this agreement, the United States had held a monopoly over the factory spaces, since the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983-1995, allowed for one-way free trade benefits on most products entering the U.S. from the Caribbean. NAFTA gave its members (Canada, the United States and Mexico) similar trade privileges amongst each other that foreign countries received in Jamaica. The agreement made it more attractive for the United States to invest in Mexico than Jamaica and resulted in many of their companies moving to factories in there. Aside from the lower transportation costs between Mexico and the United States, in 1997, Mexican workers were being paid much less than Jamaican workers. In 1996, Jamaica's exports to the United States declined 12 percent, while Mexico's exports to the United States grew by 40 percent. Similarly, by the mid 1990s, employment in the special economic zones had declined 64 percent since its peak in 1987.¹⁸⁴ The loss of 16,000 jobs between the years 1995-1997 was severely detrimental to the workers, who claimed they had been ‘ruined’ by health issues attributed to factory work, and were therefore not fit to pursue any other work. In response to the closure, the Jamaican government tried to promote export-oriented work like data processing and call centers, but neither venture was very successful and few jobs were created. As of February 2013, there has been talk of opening another SEZ in the Caymanas.


### Mexico

In May, 2016, President Enrique Peña Nieto signed a new law for the creation of special economic zones to attract investment into certain southern states of the country. The first of the zones are the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, including neighboring municipalities in Michoacán and Guerrero; a corridor in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec between Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, and Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, that includes both those cities; and the Pacific coast port of Puerto Chiapas. In 2017 another zone is to be created in the petroleum corridor of Tabasco-Campeche.

According to Vázquez Tercero & Zepeda, the Mexican Special Economic Zones regime will provide tax benefits, customs, and business facilitation measures, and possibly financial support to investors. Moreover, the federal government, in coordination with State and local authorities, will also implement parallel policies in the region, such as education, security, health, and infrastructure, in order to boost the competitiveness of the geographic location as well as to attract investment.


### Panama

The Colon Free Zone (C.F.Z.) is located in the city of Colon at the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal dedicated to re-export of merchandise to Latin America and the Caribbean.

The Panama Pacifico Special Economic Area (PPSEA) was passed into law in 2004 in the Republic of Panama. It is located on the former Howard AFB, near Panama City, on the Pacific side of the isthmus.

### Bangladesh

Several special economic zones (SEZs) have been established across Bangladesh since the 1980s.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Mandated by the Bangladesh *Economic Zones Act*, 2010, the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) was officially instituted by the government on 9 November 2010. BEZA aims to establish SEZs in all potential areas in Bangladesh including underdeveloped regions with a view to encouraging rapid economic development through increase and diversification of industry, employment, production and export.

Bangladesh government has taken an initiative to introduce a hundred SEZ throughout the country. As of March 2016, thirty seven government SEZs have acquired land and are under development.

It is notable that Shantou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai are all in Guangdong Province, and all are on the southern coast of China where the sea is very accessible for transportation of goods.


### India

India was one of the first countries in Asia to recognize the effectiveness of the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) model in promoting exports, with Asia's first EPZ set up in Kandla in 1965. In order to overcome the shortcomings experienced on account of the multiplicity of controls and clearances; absence of world-class infrastructure, and an unstable fiscal regime and with a view to attract larger foreign investments in India, the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Policy was announced in April 2000.

A comprehensive draft SEZ Bill was prepared after extensive discussions with the stakeholders. A number of meetings were held in various parts of the country both by the Minister for Commerce and Industry as well as senior officials for this purpose. The draft SEZ Rules were widely discussed and put on the website of the Department of Commerce. Around 800 suggestions were received on the draft rules.

SEZ Act provides for customs duty on services cleared into DTAIt was hoped that the bill would instill confidence in investors and signal the Government's commitment to a stable SEZ policy regime. Thereby generating greater economic activity and employment through their establishment.

The Special Economic Zones Act was passed by the Government of India in May 2005, it received Presidential assent on the 23rd of June, 2005. While introducing the act, then prime minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said:“SEZs are here to stay”.

The bill came into effect on 10 February 2006, providing for drastic simplification of procedures and for single window clearance on matters relating to central as well as state governments. The remaining part of India, not covered by the SEZ Rules, is known as the Domestic tariff area. Exports from Indian SEZ totalled INR 2.2 Trillion in 2009-10 fiscal. It grew by 43% to reach INR 3.16 Trillion in 2010-11 fiscal. Indian SEZs have created over 840,000 jobs as of 2010-11.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Exports through Indian SEZs grew further by 15.4% to reach INR 3.64 Trillion (roughly US$66 billion). As of 2011-12 fiscal, investments worth over US$36.5 billion (INR 2.02 Trillion) have been made in these tax-free enclaves. Exports of Indian SEZs have experienced a growth of 50.5% for the past eight fiscals from US$2.5 billion in 2003-04 to about US$65 billion in 2011-12 (accounting for 23% of India's total exports).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Special Economic Zone as per Central Sales Tax, 1956 --> A Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a geographically bound zone where the economic laws relating to export and import are more liberal as compared to other parts of the country. These are like a separate island within the territory of India. SEZs are projected as duty-free area for the purpose of trade, operations, duty, and tariffs. SEZ is considered to be a place outside India for all tax purpose. Within SEZs, a unit may be set-up for the manufacture of goods and other activities including processing, assembling, trading, repairing, reconditioning, making of gold/silver, platinum jewellery etc. As per law, SEZ units are deemed to be outside the customs territory of India. Goods and services coming into SEZs from the domestic tariff area or DTA are treated as exports from India and goods and services rendered from the SEZ to the DTA are treated as imports into India.

The objectives of SEZs can be explained as:ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

1. Generation of additional economic activity;
2. Promotion of exports of goods and services;
3. Promotion of investment from domestic and foreign sources;
4. Creation of employment opportunities;
5. Development of infrastructure facilities.

The incentives and facilities available to SEZ developers include:ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

* Exemption from customs/excise duties for development of SEZs for authorized operations approved by the BOA.
* Income Tax exemption on income derived from the business of development of the SEZ in a block of 10 years in 15 years under Section 80-IAB of the Income Tax Act.
* Exemption from minimum alternate tax under Section 115 JB of the Income Tax Act.
* Exemption from dividend distribution tax under Section 115O of the Income Tax Act.
* Exemption from Central Sales Tax (CST).
* Exemption from Service Tax (Section 7, 26 and Second Schedule of the SEZ Act).

There were about 143 SEZs (as of June 2012) operating throughout India, by February 2016 this had risen to 187. 634 SEZs have been approved for implementation by the Government of India (as of June 2012).


### Indonesia

### Iran

Iran's interest in free trade and special economic zones can be traced back to the 1970s. According to SOAS's Hassan Hakimian, "the FTZs are more ambitious in their objective of acting as magnets for the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and ultimately for generating a diversified industrial base and promoting Iran's non-oil exports, the SEZ are conceived for goods transit and improving the supply and distribution networks in the country."

### Philippines

Philippine economic zones (ecozones) are collections of industries, brought together geographically for the purpose of promoting economic development. These ecozones were established through Republic Act No. 7916, otherwise known as "The Special Economic Zone Act of 1995" as amended by Republic Act No. 8748.

Philippine Ecozones are generally administered by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority through a board (PEZA Board), attached to the Department of Trade and Industry. The PEZA Board sets the general policies on the establishment and operations of the Ecozones, industrial estates, export processing zones, free trade zones, and the like. They also review proposals for the establishment of Ecozones, which they subsequently endorse to the president of the Republic of the Philippines. In addition, the PEZA Board regulates and undertakes the establishment, operation and maintenance of utilities, other services and infrastructure in the Ecozone, such as heat, light and power, water supply, telecommunications, transport, toll roads and bridges, port services, and the like.

Several incentives are granted to business establishments operating within Philippine Ecozones, particularly those found in the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987. These incentives include income tax holidays; zero percent (0%) duty on importation of capital equipment, spare parts, and accessories; exemption from wharfage dues and export tax, impost or fees; and the simplification of customs procedures, among others. In addition, The Special Economic Zone Act of 1995 exempts business establishments operating within Ecozones from all taxes. In lieu of paying all other taxes, business establishments are only required to pay five percent (5%) of their gross income to the national government.

Activities Eligible for PEZA Registration and Incentives include but are not limited to (1) Export Manufacturing; (2) Information Technology Service Export; (3) Tourism; (4) Medical Tourism; (5) Agro-industrial Export Manufacturing; (6) Agro-industrial Bio-Fuel Manufacturing; and (7) Logistics and Warehousing Services.

Although designed to operate separately from the political and economic milieu of surrounding communities, Philippine economic zones do in fact interact with their neighbors. As of 31 May 2010, there were more than 200 Ecozones in the Philippines. Of these more than 200 Ecozones, seven (7) are Agro-Industrial Economic Zones, 134 are Information Technology Parks and Centers, 65 are Manufacturing Ecozones, two (2) are Medical Tourism Parks/Centers, and nine (9) are Tourism Economic Zones. Of the 41 private economic zones, the biggest exporter is Gateway Business Park in General Trias, Cavite and the second biggest private ecozone is Laguna Technopark Inc. The four governmentally owned are Cavite Economic Zone, Bataan Economic Zone, Mactan Economic Zone and Baguio Economic Zone. Some of the more well-known Economic zones are the Clark Special Economic Zone, and Subic Economic Zone, former military bases of the United States of America.

Some of the over 200 SEZs in the Philippines are as follows:

Thailand's Board of Investment (BOI) estimates that in 2015, 20-25 percent of Thailand's exports were accounted for by border trade. The BOI identifies 13 Thai industries that benefit from SEZs: agriculture; ceramics; autos; electronics; plastics; gems; furniture; textiles; medical equipment; pharmaceuticals; logistics; tourism; and industrial estates. Companies in target industries will receive an eight-year tax exemption; import duty exemptions on machinery and raw materials; double deductions on transportation costs; cheap electricity and water for 10 years; a 25 percent deduction for facilities construction; faster licensing and permit issuance; improved infrastructure and customs services within the SEZ, and other non-tax incentives. Perhaps the biggest incentive is the exclusive right to use unskilled foreign labour as the Thai workforce is in decline. Because of inadequate infrastructure in the SEZs, the government approved infrastructure development plans for SEZs that saw 2.6 billion baht expended on 45 projects in 2015 and another 79 projects, worth 7.9 billion baht, to be completed in 2016.
