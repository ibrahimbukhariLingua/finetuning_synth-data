Freiburg school


# Freiburg school



The **Freiburg school** (German: *Freiburger Schule*) is a school of economic thought founded in the 1930s at the University of Freiburg.

It builds somewhat on the earlier historical school of economics but stresses that only some forms of competition are good, while others may require oversight. This is considered a lawful and legitimate role of government in a democracy in the Freiburg school. The Freiburg school provided the economic theoretical elements of ordoliberalism and the social market economy in post-war Germany.

The Freiburg school of economics was called "neoliberalism" until Anglo-American scholars reappropriated the term.


## Adherents

Wilhelm Röpke (from the Austrian school), Alfred Müller-Armack and Alexander Rüstow were not members of the Freiburg school but did provide, together with the Freiburg school, the foundations of ordoliberalism.
