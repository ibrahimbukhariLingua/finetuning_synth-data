## Personal background

Robert Eisner was born in New York City on January 17, 1922. He was raised in Brooklyn. His father was a high school principal, and his mother a teacher, which served as a catalyst in his early graduation from high school by the time he was 14 years old. Following his high school graduation, he attended City College of New York, where he earned an undergraduate degree in history in 1940. He later earned his Master's degree in sociology, from Columbia University in 1942.

In 1942, Eisner enlisted in the US Army. He was stationed in France during World War II. He went through the Army's basic training in North Carolina. While there, he met Edith Avery Chelimer, who was attending Duke University. They were married in 1946, following his discharge from the military. Together, they had two daughters, Emily is a lawyer with the Cook County, Illinois Public Defender's Office, while Mary is the legislative director for Kent Conrad.

Following his service, Eisner attended Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, financed through the GI Bill. In 1951, he received his Ph.D. in economics and subsequently moved to Illinois, where he joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1952, he moved on to Northwestern.

Eisner died on November 25, 1998, at his home in Evanston, Illinois, from complications from a bone marrow disorder.
