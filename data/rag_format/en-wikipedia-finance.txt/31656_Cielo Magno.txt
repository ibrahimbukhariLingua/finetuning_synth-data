**Cielo Magno-Gatmaytan** is a Filipino academic who is a former undersecretary of the Department of Finance. She served as the undersecretary for the Fiscal Policy and Monitoring Group from August 2022 to September 4, 2023. She also served as the chairperson of the Philippine Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) Technical Committee, and the Inter-Agency Investment Promotion Coordination Committee (IIPCC) Technical Committee. She resigned from her post after she criticized Executive Order No. 39 of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. which imposed the price ceiling on rice prices. She posted the basic graph of supply and demand curve on her Facebook page with the line showing how the price cap can lead to rice supply shortages and may negatively affect farmers and consumers. Her post earned the ire of Malacañang with Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin issuing a statement saying that "she clearly does not support the administration and its programs for nation-building." Her controversial post earned her the reputation "for speaking her mind" especially on careless policies that may significantly affect the people's welfare.

Magno is a tenured associate professor in the University of the Philippines School of Economics before she was seconded to the Department of Finance to serve as undersecretary under the leadership of Secretary Benjamin Diokno. She was also recently selected to represent the civil society in the Global Steering Committee of the Open Government Partnership.
