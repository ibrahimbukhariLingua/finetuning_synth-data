Knowledge Generation Bureau


# Knowledge Generation Bureau



**kgb** (stylized in lower case) is a privately held, New York–based company that provides directory assistance and enhanced information services across Europe and North America. It describes itself as "the world’s largest independent provider of directory assistance and enhanced information services." Founded in 1992 by Robert Pines under the name **INFONXX**, the company rebranded in 2008. The term knowledge generation bureau is from an advertising copy line, and is not the name of the company, which is kgb.

In 2003, after the UK yellow pages directory market has been opened, kgb launched 118 118 (UK), a UK directory enquiries provider that assists customers with telephone number enquiries and general queries.

After the success of 118 118 in the UK, kgb launched 118 218 in France when the French market has been opened. Thanks to a very good advertising campaign, it became quickly and is still the most used directory assistance service in France with around 200,000 calls each day on the phone number. Its 118218.fr website was in the top 100 French websites based on traffic.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2008, kgb acquired Texperts, a United Kingdom–based firm, in order to benefit from their "innovative software platform and industry experience."ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Shortly afterwards, in January 2009, kgb launched a new suite of products in the United States, providing answers to customers’ questions through multiple platforms. The first is through a mobile search service known as 542542 (kgbkgb). It launched January 5, 2009, following the launch of the similar 118118 "Ask Us Anything" service in the United Kingdom. In February 2013, after investigation by the US Department of Labor, a judge ordered kgb to pay $1.3 million to internet researchers who had been sharply underpaid.

The company has also entered the internet group buying space with a business called kgbdeals. kgbdeals seeks to offer lifestyle deals to consumers in the US, UK, France and Italy.

## Class action lawsuit

In January 2013, kgb USA settled to pay $1.3 million in unpaid minimum wage and overtime wages to 14,000 current and former employees. The lawsuit alleged that from January 19, 2009 to December 4, 2012, kgb USA repeatedly violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) by (1) misclassifying the Special Agents as independent contractors instead of employees, (2) failing to pay minimum wage and overtime amounts, and (3) failing to make, keep, and preserve adequate and accurate employment-related records of the “Special Agents.”
