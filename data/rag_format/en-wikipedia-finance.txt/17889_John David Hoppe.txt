His firm has lobbied on behalf of Ford Motor Company since it began in 2013, and has lobbied on behalf of Delta Air Lines and MarkLogic Corporation since 2015.


## Lobbying

Hoppe has a history of government lobbying, which has called into question whether the choice of a lobbyist as Paul Ryan's Chief of Staff is another move toward the K Street Project, and has resulted in a petition against hiring corporate lobbyists into office.

Hoppe represented Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino business magnate, on behalf of the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling. The coalition was launched by Sheldon Adelson after his own company failed in its online gambling endeavor, causing Adelson to claim that his "moral standard compels" him to take a stand against internet gambling.
