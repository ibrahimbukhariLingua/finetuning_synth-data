Livan Automotive


# Livan Automotive



**Livan Automotive** (Chinese: 睿蓝汽车; pinyin: *Ruìlán Qìchē*) is a joint venture company between Lifan Group and Geely Qizheng, a company owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding (ZGH). The brand was founded in 2022 following a merger between Geely-owned Maple and Lifan Technology.

In China, Livan targeted the battery-swapping electric vehicle market. The joint venture manufactures electric vehicles using Geely's existing platforms under Livan and Maple brands. In export markets such as Russia, Livan became Geely's budget brand selling internal combustion vehicles.

On January 24, 2022, after Lifan Group was acquired by ZGH, Geely reconsolidated and merged its previous subsidiary Maple Automobile Co., Ltd. into the Livan brand. This move resulted in Maple exiting the market as an independent brand and becoming a model name under the Livan brand.


## History

Originally Shanghai Maple (SMA, Shanghai Maple Automobiles), the brand was established in 2000, producing Huapu (Maple) branded vehicles. The first Shanghai Maple vehicle was produced in the summer of 2003, based on the 1990s-era Citroën ZX. Geely acquired a strategic holding in Shanghai Maple in 2002, and in 2008, Shanghai Maple was fully consolidated into Geely as their budget brand before it was phased out in 2010 in favor of the Englon budget brand.

In March 2013, Geely and Kandi Technologies established a 50:50 joint venture, Zhejiang Kandi Electric Vehicles Investment, focused on the research and development, production, marketing, and sale of electric vehicles in the Chinese mainland. As a result of this partnership, the Maple brand was revived in 2020. The revived Maple brand began producing a series of affordable electric cars based on existing Geely petrol cars, beginning with the Maple 30X, based on the Geely Vision X3.

In March 2021, Kandi Technologies exited its stake, transferring its 22 percent equity interest to Geely. In 2022, Geely launched a joint venture between Lifan and Maple called Livan (Ruilan, 睿蓝). Geely announced the launch of the Maple Leaf 60S, Geely's first battery swap car under the Livan brand, produced in association with Lifan and based on the Geely Emgrand GL. In early 2022 the Maple brand was folded into the new Livan brand, becoming a model name used on legacy designs.

During the Livan brand launch later in June 2022, a brand new model, the Livan 7 electric fastback crossover was teased, while a few days later at the 2022 Chongqing Auto Show, the Livan 9 electric mid-size crossover SUV was shown for the first time being developed based on the Geely Haoyue.

Livan entered the Russian market in mid-2023. Instead of being an electric vehicle brand, Livan in Russia became Geely's budget brand, selling older Geely models with modified styling.

In February 2024, Geely Automobile Holdings sold its 45% stake in Livan Automotive to Geely Qizheng, another company under Zhejiang Geely Holding. Currently, Geely Qizheng and Lifan Technology hold 45% and 55% of Livan respectively, both are holding subsidiaries of Geely Group and still retained within the Geely Group.
