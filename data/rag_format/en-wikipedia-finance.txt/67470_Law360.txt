The show also typically includes a segment called "offbeat" about oddities and humorous legal stories. The podcast was launched in June 2017 and is hosted by Amber McKinney and Alex Lawson.

Law360's second podcast was launched in September 2019 and is called The Term. The show provides an overview of the action in the U.S. Supreme Court each week that the court is in session.

The first season was Law360 Explores: Legalization, a five-part series that focused on the tension for marijuana businesses that have to navigate how the drug is legal in many states but remains illegal at the federal level. Season one was hosted by senior cannabis reporter Diana Novak Jones. The second season, The Fall of Tom Girardi, investigates how one of the U.S.'s most successful plaintiff's attorney went from a legal star to being accused of exploiting survivors of an explosion as well as widows and orphans of plane crash victims.
