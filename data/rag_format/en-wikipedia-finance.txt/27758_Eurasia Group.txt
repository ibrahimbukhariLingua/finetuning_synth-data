# Eurasia Group



**Eurasia Group** is a political risk consultancy founded in 1998 by Ian Bremmer.


## History

Eurasia Group reports on emerging markets including frontier and developed economies, in addition to establishing practices focused on geo-technology and energy issues. The organization's 2011 "Top Risks report" description of a G-Zero world lacking global leadership received attention at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos in 2011, as well as in international media. American politics led the firm’s 2020 report, which was updated and re-released in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2017, Eurasia Group launched a media company called GZERO Media, featuring digital programming as well as a US national public television show called *GZERO World with Ian Bremmer*.

On January 3, 2023, at Bloomberg, Ian Bremmer discussed the TOP-10 risks for the world to face in 2023 according to Eurasia Group. The top ten risks of 2024, as outlined by Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan in their 37-page report, and published in an 8 January article in *Time*, are as follows: the United States grappling with internal challenges; Middle East teetering on the edge; Ukraine facing partition; challenges posed by ungoverned artificial intelligence; the presence of an Axis of rogue nations; absence of a recovery in China; the struggle for critical minerals; minimal margin for error; return of El Niño; and engaging in risky business. Additionally, three potential Red Herrings for 2024 were identified: a crisis between the United States and China; populist takeover of European politics; and tensions between BRICS and G7.


## Partnerships

Eurasia Group announced a partnership with Nikko Asset Management in 2015 to incorporate political risk analysis into emerging market investment funds. According to *The Wall Street Journal*, "this is the first such partnership between the consultancy and an asset manager". In 2005, Eurasia Group purchased Intellibridge, a political risk consultancy founded by David Rothkopf in 1999.

Announcing a partnership with NYSE Euronext, Eurasia Group rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on March 18, 2009.
