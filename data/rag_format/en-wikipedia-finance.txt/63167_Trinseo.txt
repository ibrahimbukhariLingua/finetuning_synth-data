# Trinseo



**Trinseo** is a company focusing particularly on the manufacture of plastics and latex binders. Trinseo (formerly known as **Styron**) was part of the Dow Chemical Company until Dow grouped several of its businesses for potential sale in 2009. In 2010, under the name Styron, those holdings were sold to private equity firm Bain Capital for $1.63 billion. As of 2016, Bain sold all of its stock in Trinseo, grossing $1.69 billion for 37,269,567 shares, resulting in Trinseo's “full independence as a public company.”

The company offers a broad line of plastics and latex binders, which are used primarily in the automotive, appliances, electronics, packaging, paper & board, textiles and carpet industries, among others. Trinseo materials are used widely in cars and trucks, home appliances, consumer goods, electronics, electrical & lighting, building & construction, medical supplies, and packaging.

As of June 12, 2014, Trinseo is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as NYSE: TSE. As of March 4, 2019, Frank Bozich became the President and CEO, succeeding Christopher D. Pappas.


## Company history

Trinseo's precursor Styron was formed in August 2009 when Dow Chemical Company combined several of its businesses--styrenics; polycarbonate and compounds & blends; Dow Automotive plastics; emulsion polymers (paper and carpet latex); and synthetic rubber — as part of a larger process of identifying and selling non-strategic assets.
Several private equity firms bid on Styron, including TPG Capital, Apollo Management, and Lotte Group. On March 2, 2010, Bain Capital announced that it would purchase the newly formed company for $1.63 billion, with Dow retaining a 7.5% stake. The sale was finalized in June 2010.

The name Trinseo was chosen in 2012. By February 2015, all legal entities worldwide had changed to the name Trinseo.

As of 2016, Bain sold all of its stock in Trinseo, grossing $1.69 billion for 37,269,567 shares, resulting in Trinseo's “full independence as a public company.” In November 2017, Trinseo started a MAGNUM ABS production line manufacturing plant at the Zhangjiagang, China site.

In March 2023, over 8,000 gallons of "latex finishing material" leaked into Otter Creek, a tributary of the Delaware River, from a Trinseo plant in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Well over a million residents of nearby areas--including more than half of the city of Philadelphia--were at least temporarily urged not to drink their tap water because of potential toxic contamination from the leak, causing widespread panic and shortages of bottled water. Work at the plant, which had been responsible for at least four other contamination incidents since 2010, was temporarily halted by Trinseo. Shares of the company fell after the leak.
