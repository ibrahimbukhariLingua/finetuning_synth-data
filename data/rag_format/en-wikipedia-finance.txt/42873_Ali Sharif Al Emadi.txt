He was appointed the bank's chief executive in 2005, succeeding Saeed bin Abdullah Al Misnad in the post.

When his request was not fulfilled, a group of Middle Eastern countries, with Jared Kushner’s backing, initiated a diplomatic assault that culminated in a blockade of Qatar. Kushner specifically undermined the efforts by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to bring an end to the standoff.
