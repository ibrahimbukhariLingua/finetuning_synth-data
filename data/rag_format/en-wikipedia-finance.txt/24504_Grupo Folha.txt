# Grupo Folha



**Grupo Folha** is the second largest Brazilian media conglomerate, after Grupo Globo. It was founded by Octávio Frias (1912–2007) and led by his son Luiz Frias since 1992.

The group publishes *Folha de S.Paulo*, the largest circulation paper in the country, which since 1986 keeps the leadership among quality general-interest newspapers in Brazil. In the last decade, the group nearly tripled its revenue, getting to R$2.7 billion in 2010. EBITDA reached R$600 million in 2011.


## Circulation

In February 2012, Folha widened its lead among prestige newspapers in Brazil, with an average of 297.5 thousand monthly copies in circulation, 12% ahead of O Globo and 20.3% ahead of O Estado de S. Paulo, competitors in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo states. Besides Folha, the group publishes Agora São Paulo newspaper and has 50% shares at Valor Econômico, in partnership with Organizações Globo. Both are circulation leaders, respectively, in popular journalism and business journalism markets.
