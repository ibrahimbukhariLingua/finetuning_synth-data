## History

Farstad Shipping was founded as a traditional shipping company in 1956. The company was one of the first operators in the North Sea that decided to focus on offshore service vessels. In 1973 the company contracted its first supply vessel, an anchor handling vessel of the type UT 704.

Until the mid-1980s the company grew through various forms of collaboration both concerning ownership and operations. The acquisition of two service vessel fleets during the second half of the 80's was an important event in the further development of the company. At the same time, the company built independent operational and marketing functions. During this period, the ship-owning part was gathered in one company.

Since 1990, the renewal and growth of the fleet ha largely taken place by selling older vessels and implementing a considerable newbuild programme. This growth has been founded in the Norwegian maritime cluster. Farstad Shipping's international presence increased significantly during the 2000s.


## Operations

Farstad Shipping is currently among the six largest companies worldwide in the market for large and medium-sized supply vessels. About 63% of this world fleet is in North-West Europe, Brazil, and the Indian Pacific where the company's activities are mainly concentrated.
