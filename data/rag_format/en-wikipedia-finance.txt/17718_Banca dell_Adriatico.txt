## History

**Banca Popolare Pesarese** was found in Pesaro, Marche in 1875, at that time a cooperative bank. In 1989 the bank was merged with Romagnol company Cooperativa di Bagnacavallo e Fusignano, becoming **Banca Popolare Pesarese e Ravennate**. In 1994 Banca Popolare Abruzzese Marchigiana (itself a merger of Banca Popolare di Teramo, based in Abruzzo and Banca Popolare di San Benedetto del Tronto, based in Marche) and Banca Popolare di Castel di Sangro based in Abruzzo) joined the group as **Banca Popolare dell'Adriatico** (Popular Bank of Adriatic coasts).

The bank was acquired by Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna in 1997 (Carisbo; for 47.08% shares), which was part of Casse Emiliano Romagnole Group (CAER). CAER also hold 5% shares directly.
