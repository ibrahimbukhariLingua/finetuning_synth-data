## History

Huron Valley State Bank is a bank founded and headquartered in Milford, Michigan.

Established in 2005 by Clarkston Financial Corporation (CFC) as a de-novo bank, Huron Valley State Bank became independent of CFC 3 years later in 2008. Since its founding, the bank has expanded through the opening of 3 Branches, 2 Loan Centers and a Financial Center.

HVSB now actively serves the communities of Milford, Highland, South Lyon, Commerce, Brighton, Plymouth, among others in the surrounding area.


## Clarkston State Bank

In December 2004, CFC, the holding company for Clarkston State Bank, announced its plan to open a new bank in Milford in July 2005. Edwin L. Adler, then board chairman of CFC, revealed that the bank would be replacing a loan production office on North Main St. that Clarkston State Bank had opened earlier that month. Huron Valley State Bank began with David H. Blossey serving as director, president and CEO.

Due to apparent financial pressure from failing commercial loans, Clarkston Financial Corporation divested its share of Huron Valley State Bank a year later in 2005.

In June 2019, Clarkston Financial Corporation was acquired by Waterford Bancorp, Inc.


## Bank Branches

In August 2005, the first Huron Valley State Bank branch opened its doors to the public. The Main Street Branch was located in the Mill Valley Center, across the street from the Flat Iron Building, at 525 North Main Street. This location housed the entirety of the bank's operations until the opening of the Main Street Lending Center in 2012 which relocated the loan department.

In October 2008, after outgrowing the location and gaining independence from CFC, the main office was relocated to its current home in the south side of Milford on Milford Road. The bank's operations stayed in the branch until the opening of the Financial Center in 2018. With the opening of the center, most of the bank's operations and loan departments were consolidated into one building.

Later in 2008, following the acquisition of a closed Fifth Third Bank Branch, the Milford location was accompanied by a second branch in Highland on M-59 and Duck Lake Road.


## Loan and Financial Centers

In June 2012, the bank's former Main Street Lending Center was opened at 522 North Main Street in Milford. The center was located across the street from the original branch on Main Street between the Flat Iron Building and Commerce Road.

In August 2018, the bank opened its newest facility. The Financial Center is located directly behind Holden’s Party Store and adjacent to Baker’s of Milford. The branch now houses part of the bank’s lending and the entirety of its operations activities.

In May 2023, the bank expanded outside of Oakland County for the first time into neighboring Wayne County with its Plymouth Loan Center. The branch is located in the downtown area at 706 South Main Street, at the corner of Linden Street and Main Street.


## Milford Road ATM Re-Opening

In September 2017, the bank hosted a re-opening ceremony for its first freestanding ATM. The replacement machine was positioned in the parking lot in front of Holden’s Party Store across from the entrance of Kensington Metropark and Dairy Queen.

The original ATM at that location was initially attached to the storefront of Holden's Party Store and was subsequently destroyed by a fire that occurred in the store on September 2, 2015.
