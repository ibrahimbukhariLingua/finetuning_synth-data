## Career

Cadsby joined the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in 1991. In 1998 he was put in charge of CIBC Securities Inc., then the seventh-largest fund company in Canada with $21 billion of assets under management. In this role, he advocated for index investing and was dubbed Canada's "Mr. Index Man" by Money Sense Magazine, "Index-Investing Guru" by *The Toronto Star*, "Trend-Setter" by *The Financial Post*, "Great Cadsby" by The Vancouver Sun, and "Whizz" by The Globe and Mail.

He gained attention for his advocacy of both index investing and addressing common investment errors. He was profiled in the book *The Money Machine* by Daniel Hoffman, which highlighted his demonstrations at financial conferences showing that fund managers who consistently outperform market indexes are often more lucky than skilled. His views, considered controversial within the industry, were described by the *Financial Post* as "ruffling feathers." These ideas formed the basis of his national bestseller books *The Power of Index Funds* and *The 10 Biggest Investment Mistakes*.

While Cadsby continued to advocate for this investment approach CIBC's funds under management doubled in size. Cadsby was appointed, in addition to being CEO and President of CIBC Securities, as Chair of CIBC Trust Corp., and Chair of CIBC Private Investment Counsel Ltd. He later became the Executive Vice-President of Retail Distribution, managing the retail bank's network of over 1,100 branches and 18,000 employees worldwide.

Cadsby served as a corporate director on several boards, including ResMor Trust Company, The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Foundation (CAMH), Meridian Credit Union, Canadian Scholarship Trust Foundation, The Mutual Fund Dealer's Association of Canada.


## Media and writing

Cadsby moved from banking into consulting and writing. He has authored numerous articles and opinion pieces on leadership, entrepreneurship, innovation and how humans navigate complexity. Cadsby is the author of four books including Closing the Mind Gap: Making Smarter Decisions in a Hyper-Complex World (foreword by Don Tapscott), and Hard to Be Human: Overcoming Our 5 Cognitive Design Flaws. His articles have been featured in publications such as the *Toronto Star*, *The Globe and Mail*, and the *Harvard Business Review*.
