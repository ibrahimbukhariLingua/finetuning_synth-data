## Strategic alliance

The main way to apply cooperative strategies are through strategic alliances in which firms use their resources and knowledge to create a competitive advantage. There are three types of strategic alliances.

In 2013 Fly Emirates made an Equity Strategi Alliance with Jet Airways both companies made an investment of $379 million in order that each company can get benefits of this alliance.


### Nonequity strategic alliance

Nonequity strategic alliance refers to a type of cooperation wherein two or more companies establish a contractual relation which specifies that each company will share their resources and knowledge to achieve competitive advantage. In this case cooperation is not totally equal because each company will share only the resources that are convenient and this could cause that a company lose more than the others.Geringer and Herbert in 1989 made a nonequity strategic alliance that did not work because of the concept because each company chose how much to contribute, and in many cases this means that companies would not take risks, and this affects the alliance.
