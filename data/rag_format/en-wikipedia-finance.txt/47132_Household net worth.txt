Household net worth


# Household net worth



**Household total net** is the net worth for individuals living together in a household and is used as a measure in economics to compare wealth. The household net worth is the value of total assets minus the total value of outstanding liabilities, which are current obligations of a household arising from past transactions or events.


## Disposable income

Household financial net worth is the balancing item of their financial balance sheet recorded at current market values. Total net worth is measured as a percentage of net disposable income.


## Purchasing power parity

The United States Census Bureau has collected uniform data on household income since the 1960s. The Bureau undertakes an annual Current Population Survey (CPS) and publishes detailed information on household income.

The financial net worth of a household is calculated as the ratio of financial net worth of households divided by the number of individuals in the country, expressed in United States dollars at current purchasing power parity.


## Household wellbeing

The household net worth can be assessed by considering factors that contribute to the household wellbeing, such as access to finance, debt default, and measures of economic security.
