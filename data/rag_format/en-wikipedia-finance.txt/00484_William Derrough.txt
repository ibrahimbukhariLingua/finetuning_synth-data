After intensive training aboard PT boats in Naragansett Bay, Derrough’s father served aboard PT 117 and PT 61 in the South Pacific, mostly in the Solomon Islands, where he saw significant action as the PT boats were the only line of defense against the Japanese in that part of the pacific for several years.

## Democratic National Committee

Derrough was elected to a four-year term as Treasurer of the Democratic National on February 25, 2017 along with newly elected Chair Tom Perez, and was tasked with restructuring operations of the DNC. Derrough’s principal areas of focus included updating the DNC’s internal finance, audit and accounting functions, improving relationships with its key lender and improving the transparency of DNC finances to its 447 voting members.

During this period, the DNC successfully rebuilt its operations, especially its data and tech and its state-level organization and mobilization capabilities, to support Democratic candidates running for office at all levels “up and down the ticket”. These efforts helped lead to successful electoral victories in November 2017 in Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial and state legislative races and the December 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama. Democrats gained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2018.

In August 2020, the Democratic National Committee nominated Joseph R. Biden, Jr. as its nominee for President of the United States and Kamala D. Harris as its nominee for Vice President. Biden and Harris defeated incumbents Donald J. Trump and Michael Pence on November 6, 2020, winning more votes than any national ticket in history. As part of the 2020 presidential election process, the DNC raised $493 million, more than any year in its history. The previous record of $372 million was set in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the nominee. The DNC ended the year with more cash on hand than at any time in its previous history. Derrough was named a top fundraiser for the Biden campaign in a campaign statement in November 2020.

Derrough did not stand for re-election in January 2021 and was succeeded by Virginia McGregor.
