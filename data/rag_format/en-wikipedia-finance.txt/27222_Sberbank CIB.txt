### Troika Laundromat

Also known as **ŪkioLeaks**, Troika Laundromat was a collection of 70 offshore shell companies whose controllers used them to move billions of dollars of private wealth from Russia to the west. About $4.6bn was paid into the Troika network, and a similar sum was paid out of it. It was operated by staff at an independent arm of the Russian investment bank **Troika Dialog**, which has now been merged with one of Russia's two big state-owned banks. The network was like a washing machine: money arrived from many sources. Most transfers were at Lithuania's Ukio Bank, closed by the authorities in February 2013.
