## Corporate history

Oxford Leaseholds was established in 1960 in Edmonton by Don Love, and John and George Poole, founders of PCL Construction. Don Love had arrived in Edmonton in 1955 as a stockbroker working for a national securities firm. A physician client approached him about building a medical clinic in Edmonton, asking if he knew of any potential investors. He knew E.E. Poole, another one of his clients, and when Love made the proposal, Ernest Poole declined but suggested that his sons John and George might have some interest. The three started a new company called "POLO" – "PO" for Poole, and "LO" for Love. John and George provided the capital. The trio secured a mortgage and built the Baker Clinic, which they then sold back to the doctors of the practice. A decade later, a new ownership structure was introduced, as Oxford went private in 1980 in a management-led leveraged buyout. To pay for the deal, it sold its shopping centres. The decade did not pass quietly however, with assets rising above $3 billion. Oxford Properties set up its headquarters in Toronto's Richmond-Adelaide Centre and sold its U.S. business to BCE Development Corp. Next, the company split into two separate companies: Oxford Properties Canada Ltd. put the company's real estate back in public hands, and Oxford Development Group remained private and managed all of the company's real estate.

In 1988, the two companies merged and once again went public, with help from a $60 million investment from a Hong Kong investor. The company made significant real estate investments, buying entire portfolios from Marathon, Greiner-Pacaud, Hammerson Canada, Royal Bank of Canada and Canderel Group. In 2001, the company became wholly owned by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System.
