## History

The Karachi Stock Exchange was established on 18 September 1947, after the arrival of the educated and affluent Muhajirs, and was incorporated as Karachi Stock Exchange Limited on 10 March 1949. The KSE began with 5 companies as *KSE 50* with a total market capitalization of Rs. 37 million (US$130,000). For over 60 years, the KSE facilitated capital formation, serving a wide spectrum of participants, including individual and institutional investors. With a growing number of listed companies and trading activities by the late 1980s, another index was proposed. On 1 November 1991, the KSE 100 Index was introduced. By 1995, the need for a futures index was realized and on 18 September 1995, the KSE All Shares Index was introduced. To address the needs of the investors community, two other indexes were introduced in the late 1990s - the KSE-30 Index and KMI 30 Index. Work on a fully automated trading system began in the late 1990s and in 2002, the *Karachi Automated Trading System* or KATS was launched, which had the ability to handle over 1 million trades per day. In the same year, the KSE was declared the *"Best Performing Stock Market of the World"*. In 2016, the Karachi Stock Exchange, Lahore Stock Exchange and Islamabad Stock Exchange were integrated under the *Stock Exchanges (Corporatisation, Demutualization and Integration) Act, 2012* to form the Pakistan Stock Exchange.
