She became a teacher in 1998 and joined Banco do Brasil in 2000. She obtained a bachelor's degree in business administration in 2012 from the online university *Faculdade AIEC*.


## Career

Following a competitive exam, Medeiros started with the bank as a relationship manager in Teixeira de Freitas in the state of Bahia, moving to a similar position in Itabuna, Bahia in October 2005. In 2008 she became a client relations manager in João Pessoa in Paraíba. In May 2013 she became a business manager in Belém in the State of Pará.

On 26 January 2023, Brazil's president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appointed Medeiros as the president of Banco do Brasil. In making the announcement of her appointment he stated that "Banco do Brasil is 200 years old, and no one has ever thought, not even remotely, about having a woman as president. And we are going to prove that a woman can be better than many men who have already run the bank". She thus became the first woman to hold this position since the bank was founded in 1808. In 2024 she received an MBA in marketing, branding and growth from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PCURS).
