## History


### Bain Capital founding

Accuride was founded in 1986 in order to acquire the wheel-making division of Firestone Tire & Rubber Company. The purchase was orchestrated by Bain Capital under the direction of Mitt Romney. With Bain Capital as its new owners, Accuride revamped production and restructured executive pay, quickly boosting the company's profitability. Accuride's earnings rose 20 percent in the first year under Bain's watch, and the number of plants increased by 16 percent to 1,785. Bain Capital sold the company to a mining conglomerate 18 months later, making approximately $120 million from its $5 million investment. The success of the takeover and turnaround quickly put Romney and Bain on the map.


### Recession and bankruptcy

The 2008–2012 recession undermined the global demand for commercial vehicles and freight components, drastically damaging Accuride's profitability. In October 2009, the company sought legal protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy rules, and in November 2009 sought court approval to reorganize itself. On 26 February 2010, Accuride emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a new capital structure.


### Acquisition by Crestview Partners

In 2016 Accuride was acquired by Crestview Partners, a New York–based private equity firm for $2.58 per share in cash. As part of the transaction, Accuride announced it sold its Brillion Iron Works subsidiary to Metaldyne Performance Group (MPG) for a total of $14 million.

In October 2024, Accuride again filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after it fell victim to a freight industry recession. The company listed liabilities between $500 million to $1 billion.


## Business

The company produces commercial vehicle wheels, wheel-end components and assemblies, and other commercial vehicle components. Accuride markets its products using three brand names: Accuride, Gunite, and KIC.
