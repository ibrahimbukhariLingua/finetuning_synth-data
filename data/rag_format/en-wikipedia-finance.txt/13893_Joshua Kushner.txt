## Early life and education

Joshua Kushner was born on June 12, 1985, in Livingston, New Jersey, where he grew up in a Jewish family to parents Charles and Seryl Kushner. Kushner graduated from Harvard College in 2008, and from Harvard Business School in 2011.


## Career


### Early career

During his sophomore year, Kushner was founding executive editor of *Scene*, a new pop culture student-publication. The publication was badly received by critics upon release.

In the spring of his junior year he worked with two graduate students to pool $10,000 in order to found social network Vostu, which aimed to "fill a void left by online communities in which English is the lingua franca", like Facebook. According to Kushner, Latin America was a promising market for a Facebook-alternative and new social networking site because "[it was] a place where Internet use is increasing every year, and technology is booming at a rapid pace". Vostu laid off the majority of its employees in 2013 and significantly scaled back its operations after a copyright lawsuit from a competitor accused them of copying games.

The year after graduation he co-founded a start-up called Unithrive. Unithrive was inspired by the peer-to-peer loan model of Kiva, but aimed to "ease the crisis in paying for college" by matching "alumni lenders to cash-strapped students ... who [could] post photographs and biographical information and request up to $2,000", interest-free for repayment within five years of graduation. After graduating from Harvard, he started his career in the private equity arm at Goldman Sachs, working for a year on distressed debt.


### Thrive Capital

He founded Thrive Capital in 2010, a venture capital firm that focuses on media and internet investments. Since its founding, Thrive has raised over $7.3 billion from institutional investors, including Princeton University. Thrive’s capital funds include: Thrive II, which raised $40 million in 2011; Thrive III, which raised $150 million in 2012; Thrive IV, which raised $400 million in September 2014; Thrive V, raising $700 million in 2016; Thrive VI, raising $1 billion in 2018; Thrive VII, raising $2 billion in 2021; Thrive VIII, raising $3 billion in 2022; and Thrive IX, raising $5 billion in 2024.

As an investor in Instagram, Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round. Valued at $500 million, Thrive soon doubled its money after Instagram was sold to Facebook.

For his work with Thrive, Kushner was named to *Forbes*' 30 Under 30, Inc. magazine's 35 Under 35, *Crain's* 40 Under 40, and *Vanity Fair*'s Next Establishment.

In 2021, it was reported by Bloomberg that Goldman Sachs had invested in Kushner's Thrive Capital at a $3.6 billion valuation. Kushner sold a 3.3% stake in Thrive to a group of investors, including Disney's Bob Iger and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' Henry Kravis, valuing Thrive at $5.3 billion.

As of September 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, *Forbes* estimates his net worth to be $3.8 billion, primarily from his ownership in Thrive. *Fortune* magazine listed Kushner in its inaugural list of the 100 Most Powerful People in Business in 2024, citing Thrive's early investment in OpenAI.


### Oscar

Kushner is a co-founder and vice-chairman of Oscar Health, a health insurance start-up. Founded in 2012, Oscar was valued at $2.7 billion in 2016. Oscar went public in 2021, with Kushner's Thrive Capital owning a stake worth $1.21 billion. Oscar reported an $87 million loss in its first quarter as a publicly traded company.

In 2020, it was revealed by *The Atlantic* that Jared Kushner had contracted Oscar Health to develop a coronavirus testing website that was later scrapped, even though Trump had said publicly that Google was developing the website.


### Cadre

In 2015, Kushner founded a new company called Cadre with his brother Jared and their friend Ryan Williams, with Williams as Cadre's CEO. Cadre is a technology platform designed to help certain types of clients, such as family offices and endowments, invest in real estate.


### JK2

Kushner and his brother, Jared, each own 50% of JK2 (also known as Westminster Management), a real estate management company, but Joshua is not involved with the business.

In April 2021, a Judge ruled that JK2 was found to have committed "widespread and numerous" violations of Maryland's consumer protection laws at Baltimore-area properties by collecting debts without the required licenses, charging tenants improper fees, and misrepresenting the condition of rental units. During the COVID-19 pandemic, JK2 filed a significant number of lawsuits against tenants for debt collection and eviction, despite an eviction moratorium being in place.

Kushner's JK2 was also featured in an episode of Netflix's *Dirty Money* series titled "Slumlord Millionaire." The episode was based on an expose from ProPublica accusing the company of abusing tenants rights, leaving homes in disrepair, humiliating late-paying renters and suing tenants when they try and move out.


### Other activities

Kushner became a minority owner of the Memphis Grizzlies after acquiring a 2.5% stake in 2019. In 2024, Kushner and his wife's media company, Bedford Media, announced plans to revive Life magazine in an agreement with Dotdash Meredith, with the first print issue scheduled for early 2025. He also joined the board of directors of A24 Films that year.


## Personal life

Kushner married model Karlie Kloss in 2018. They have two children.

In December 2020, the couple purchased a home in Miami, Florida, for US$23.5 million. They also bought a 7,200-square-foot (670 m²) penthouse in the Puck Building in Manhattan for $35 million in 2021, and paid $29.5 million for the Wave House in Malibu, California, in August 2024.

Kushner was included in a 2024 *Washington Post* article about a WhatsApp group chat from October 2023 through early May that year where some United States' business leaders discussed "chang[ing] the narrative" in favor of Israel by conveying “the atrocities committed by Hamas…to all Americans,” following Hamas's October 7th attack on Israel. However, a spokesperson of Kushner stated that, “Josh has not participated in [the group chat].”
