## History

The company was founded in North Memphis in 1940 by Philip Belz (1904-2000). The firm's earliest projects included small retail and residential spaces and soon expanded to industrial development, starting with a roofing materials factory on the former site of the North Memphis Driving Park (horse racing track).
