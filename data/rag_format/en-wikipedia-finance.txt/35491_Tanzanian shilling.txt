Tanzanian shilling


# Tanzanian shilling



The **shilling** (Swahili: *shilingi*; abbreviation: **TSh**; code: **TZS**) is the currency of Tanzania. It is subdivided into 100 *cents* (*senti* in Swahili).
The Tanzanian shilling replaced the East African shilling on 14 June 1966 at par.


## Notation

Prices in the Tanzanian shilling are written in the form of `x/y`, where x is the amount above 1 shilling, while y is the amount in cents. An equals sign or hyphen represents zero amount. For example, 50 cents is written as "-/50" and 100 shillings as "100/=" or "100/-". Sometimes the abbreviation *TSh* is prefixed for distinction. If the amount is written using words as well as numerals, only the prefix is used (e.g. TSh 10 million).

This pattern was modelled on sterling's pre-decimal notation, in which amounts were written in some combination of pounds (£), shillings (s), and pence (d, for denarius). In that notation, amounts under a pound were notated only in shillings and pence.


## Coins

In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of -/5, -/10, -/20 and -/50 and 1/=, with the -/5 struck in bronze, the -/10 in nickel-brass (copper-nickel-zinc) and the -/50 and 1/= in cupro-nickel. Cupro-nickel 5/= coins were introduced in 1972, followed by scalloped, nickel-brass -/10 in 1977. This First Series coins set, in circulation from 1966 up to 1984, was designed by Christopher Ironside OBE.

In 1987, nickel-plated steel replaced cupro-nickel in the -/50 and 1/=, and cupro-nickel 5/= and 10/= coins were introduced, with the 5/= decagonal in shape. In 1990, nickel-clad-steel 5/=, 10/= and 20/= were introduced, followed by brass-plated steel coins for 100/= in 1993, 50/= in 1996 and copper-nickel-zinc 200/= in 1998.

Coins currently in circulation are the 50/=, 100/=, 200/=, and 500/=. The 500/= coin was issued on 8 September 2014.

## Banknotes

On 14 June 1966, the Benki Kuu Ya Tanzania (Bank of Tanzania) introduced notes for 5/=, 10/=, 20/= and 100/=. The 5/= note was replaced by a coin in 1972. 50/= notes were introduced in 1985, followed by 200/= in 1986, 500/= in 1989 and 1,000/= in 1990. The 10/=, 20/=, 50/= and 100/= notes were replaced by coins in 1987, 1990, 1996 and 1994, respectively. 5,000/= and 10,000/= notes were introduced in 1995, followed by 2,000/= in 2003. A new series of notes came out in 2011. These new notes include many security features that prevent counterfeiting.
