With the group's core trading platform, Fidessa, being better known in the market place, the Royalblue Group plc changed its name to Fidessa Group plc following shareholder approval at the AGM held in April 2007. In November 2008, Fidessa launched its Fidessa Fragmentation Index. In April 2011, Fidessa launched the Tradalyzer that provides detailed trading analysis.

On 20 February 2018, it was announced that Temenos Group was in advanced talks to purchase Fidessa. The following day, Fidessa's board recommended that shareholders accept an offer of £35.67 per share to purchase the company, valuing it at £1.4 billion.

This offer was later beaten by an offer from ION Investment Group who offered £39.50 per share, valuing the company at £1.5 billion.
