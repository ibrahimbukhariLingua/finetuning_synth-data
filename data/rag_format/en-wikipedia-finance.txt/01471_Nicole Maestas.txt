## Biography

Nicole Maestas earned a BA in English and Spanish from Wellesley College in 1991. She then received her M.P.P. in Public Policy from the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley in 1997, and her Ph.D. in Economics also from UC Berkeley in 2002.

## Research

Nicole Maestas studies the economics of disability insurance, labor markets, health care systems, and population aging. Her research studies how the health and disability insurance systems affect individual economic behaviors, such as labor supply and the use of medical care. Dr. Maestas' research has shown how the federal disability insurance system discourages employment by people with disabilities. In other work she has examined how population aging affects economic growth, how individuals value their working conditions, and the effects of state Medicaid policies on the health care and well-being of people receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. In current work, Dr. Maestas is investigating the causes and consequences of the opioid epidemic and how the provider landscape shapes disparities in access to mental health care, and she is developing new methods of measuring work capacity. Dr. Maestas has published widely in the leading journals of economics, policy and medicine.
