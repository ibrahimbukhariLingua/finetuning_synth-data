Koch, Inc.


# Koch, Inc.



**Koch, Inc.** (/koʊk/ KOHK) is an American multinational conglomerate corporation based in Wichita, Kansas, and is the second-largest privately held company in the United States, after Cargill. Its subsidiaries are involved in the manufacturing, refining, and distribution of petroleum, chemicals, energy, fiber, intermediates and polymers, minerals, fertilizer, pulp and paper, chemical technology equipment, cloud computing, finance, raw materials trading, and investments. Koch owns Flint Hills Resources, Georgia-Pacific, Guardian Industries, Infor, Invista, KBX, Koch Ag & Energy Solutions, Koch Engineered Solutions, Koch Investments Group, Koch Minerals & Trading, and Molex. The firm employs 122,000 people in 60 countries, with about half of its business in the United States.

The company was founded by its namesake, Fred C. Koch, in 1940 after he developed an innovative crude oil refining process. Fred C. Koch died in 1967 and his majority interest in the company was split amongst his four sons. In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle over the amount of dividends paid by the company, the stakes of Frederick R. Koch and William "Bill" Koch were bought out for $1.1 billion and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company. Charles owns 42% of the company; trusts for the benefit of Elaine Tettemer Marshall (the daughter in-law of J. Howard Marshall) and Elaine's children, Preston Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall Jr., own 16% of the company. David Koch died on August 23, 2019, and his heirs own the remaining 42% balance of the corporation.

Charles Koch has stated that the company would go public "over my dead body" and that the company has used its freedom from the pressures of public markets to make long-term investments and concentrate on growth.


## History


### Predecessor companies

In 1925, Fred C. Koch joined MIT classmate Lewis E. Winkler at an engineering firm in Wichita, Kansas, which was renamed the Winkler-Koch Engineering Company. In 1927, they developed a more efficient thermal cracking process for turning crude oil into gasoline. This process, which the company sold to many independent refineries in the United States, threatened the competitive advantage of established oil companies, which sued for patent infringement. Temporarily forced out of business in the United States, they turned to other markets, including the Soviet Union, where Winkler-Koch built 15 cracking units between 1929 and 1932. During this time, Koch came to despise communism and Joseph Stalin's regime. In his 1960 book, *A Business Man Looks at Communism*, Koch wrote that he found the USSR to be "a land of hunger, misery, and terror." According to Charles Koch, "Virtually every engineer he worked with [there] was purged."

In the 1930s Winkler-Koch built refineries in nine different countries across hundreds of projects. In 1933 when several American companies were doing business in Germany, in a joint venture with William Rhodes Davis, Koch assisted in the design and construction of the third-largest oil refinery in Germany at the time. It was also one of the few refineries capable of refining fuel for airplanes, and was later a strategic bombing target for Allied forces when World War II broke out. The project was stalled for some time as Davis sought approval, which was granted by the Nazi government. The war commenced six years after the refinery was completed. Koch’s business, and the Koch family, supported the American war effort against Adolf Hitler and his government.

In 1940, Koch joined new partners to create the Wood River Oil and Refining Company. In 1946, the firm acquired the Rock Island refinery and crude oil gathering system near Duncan, Oklahoma. Wood River was later renamed the Rock Island Oil & Refining Company. Charles Koch joined Rock Island in 1961, having started his career at the management consulting firm Arthur D. Little. He became president in 1966 and chairman at age 32, upon his father's death the following year.


### Koch Industries

Wood River Oil and Refining Company was renamed **Koch Industries** in 1968 in honor of Fred Koch, the year after his death. At that time, it was primarily an engineering firm with a 35% interest in Great Northern Oil Company, which owned the Pine Bend Refinery in Minnesota, a crude oil-gathering system in Oklahoma, and some cattle ranches.

In 1968, Charles approached Union Oil of California about buying its 40% interest in Great Northern Oil Company but the discussions quickly stalled after Union asked for a large premium. In 1969, Koch merged his interest with the 15% interest owned by J. Howard Marshall, then owning a combined 50% of the company, preventing Union from assembling a controlling interest. They then acquired Union's interest. The Pine Bend Refinery produced chemicals, fibers, polymers, asphalt and other commodities such as petroleum coke and sulfur.

In 1970, Charles was joined at the family firm by his brother David Koch. Having started as a technical services manager, David became president of Koch Engineering in 1979.

In 1979, the company acquired 780 dealerships from Chrysler.

In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle over the amount of dividends paid by the company, in a settlement, the stakes of William "Bill" Koch and Frederick R. Koch, who wanted the company to pay more dividends rather than reinvest in the business, were bought out for $620 million and $400 million, respectively, and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company. In June 1985, William and Frederick sued their brothers claiming that they were underpaid for their stakes, but the suit was dismissed for lack of merit.

In September 2001, the company acquired KoSa. This company is considered the largest producer of polyester in the world.

In 2005, the company acquired Georgia-Pacific, one of the world's largest timber, forest products and paper companies.

In 2008, the company discovered that the French affiliate Koch-Glitsch had violated bribery laws allegedly securing contracts in Algeria, Egypt, India, Morocco, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia after an investigation by Ethics Compliance officer, Egorova-Farines. After Koch Industries' investigative team looked into her findings, the four employees involved were terminated. According to journalist Jennifer Rubin, Koch Industries' general counsel stated that Egorova-Farines failed to promptly share the findings, choosing instead to give the information to a manager at Koch-Glitsch who was later fired for bribery. According to Koch Industries' general counsel, "Egorova-Farines was not fired but instead ran into performance problems, left the company to go on leave and never returned." Egorova-Farines sued Koch-Glitsch for wrongful termination in France, lost, and "was ordered to pay costs for bringing a frivolous case".

In 2010, the company was among the first group of nearly 2,000 employers that applied for and were granted federal reimbursements from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under the new Early Retiree Reinsurance Program established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, for providing health insurance to retirees too young to be eligible for Medicare.

In 2013, the company acquired Molex, a provider of electronic components, for $7.2 billion.

In September 2014, along with the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, the company acquired Flint Group, a printing ink producer, for $3 billion.

In June 2014, the United Negro College Fund announced a $25 million grant from Koch Industries and the Charles Koch Foundation to go towards merit-based scholarships and general support of historically black colleges and universities.

In December 2014, the company acquired Oplink Communications, an optical networking device maker, for $445 million.

In 2015, the company joined the "Ban the Box" movement by removing questions about prior criminal convictions from its job application, making it easier for ex-offenders to find work.

In November 2015, the company "signed a Statement of Support with Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) that pledges Koch will provide supervisors with the tools to hire and support employees serving in the National Guard of the United States."

From 2017 to 2021, the company was featured in the Forbes' list of America's Best Employers by State.

In November 2017, Koch Disruptive Technologies was established, the corporation's venture arm, led by Chase Koch, son of Charles Koch.

In July 2019, the company sold its leases in the Athabasca oil sands.

In December 2021, Rupert Murdoch and his wife, Jerry Hall, acquired a 340,000 acres (1,400 km²) ranch in Beaverhead County, Montana, from Matador Cattle Company, a subsidiary of the company, for $200 million. Matador was formed in 1951 by Fred Koch. It won the 2010 Lone Star Land Steward Award. The company also owns ranches in Kansas and Texas that are being marketed for sale.

In March 2023, Koch Industries announced a leadership restructuring wherein Charles Koch will remain chairman and serve as co-CEO alongside Dave Robertson, who will serve as vice chairman of the board. Jim Hannan was named President and COO. Chase Koch and Richard Dinkel were both named executive Vice President while maintaining their other roles. In addition, Ray Geoffroy and Mark Luetters were named senior vice presidents.

In 2024, the company announced a name change to Koch, Inc. to reflect its broadening scope.

## Environmental and safety record

Bloomberg reports that from 1999 to 2003, Koch, Inc. was assessed "more than $400 million in fines, penalties and judgements". The eight instances mentioned by Bloomberg include:

* In October 1994, a pipeline broke and discharged over 90,000 gallons of crude oil into Gum Hollow Creek, in Refugio County, Texas. Heavy rains carried the oil to the Nueces River and on into Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays. The discharge oiled terrestrial and aquatic wildlife. The criminal case was settled in March 2000.

* In 1996, an 8-inch-diameter steel LPG pipeline operated by Koch Pipeline Company ruptured near Lively, Texas, and began leaking butane gas. The vapor cloud ignited when two teenaged residents drove their pickup truck across a creek near the pipeline while on their way to a neighbor's house to call 9-1-1 and report the smell of gas. The two were killed in the explosion, and approximately 25 families were later evacuated from the neighborhood without injury. An investigation conducted by the NTSB found that the pipe section which failed had not been shown to have excessive corrosion in a 1995 inspection.

* In 1999, a Texas jury found that negligence had led to the rupture of the Koch pipeline and awarded the victims' families $296 million.

* In March 1999, Koch Petroleum Group acknowledged that it had negligently discharged hundreds of thousands of gallons of aviation fuel into wetlands from its refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota, and that it had illegally dumped a million gallons of high-ammonia wastewater onto the ground and into the Mississippi River. Koch Petroleum paid a $6 million fine and $2 million in remediation costs and was ordered to serve three years of probation.

* In 2000, as a result of 312 oil spills attributed to Koch and its subsidiaries across six states, Koch paid what was at the time the largest civil fine ever imposed on a company under any federal environmental law. Koch disputed the EPA figures, saying the EPA did not file claims in over half of the cases, and that "Many of these alleged spills are not even listed in the EPA's own oil spill data base." In a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department and the state of Texas the company agreed to pay a "$30 million civil penalty, improve its leak-prevention programs and spend $5 million on environmental projects".

* In September 2000, a federal grand jury returned a 97-count indictment against Koch Industries and four individual employees for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act and benzene emissions from a Corpus Christi, Texas, plant. In April 2001, Koch pleaded guilty to one count, regarding improper self-reporting related to wastewater. Koch Industries was fined $20 million.

* In December 2000, Koch Petroleum settled with the Justice Department and EPA by agreeing to spend $80 million on up-to-date pollution-control equipment at two refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas and one near St. Paul, Minnesota, and agreed to pay a $4.5 million penalty.

* In June 2003, the US Commerce Department settled with Flint Hills Resources for 40 violations of improper exporting of crude petroleum from the US to Canada for a civil penalty of $200,000.

According to the 2016 documentary, Company Town, improper waste disposal by a Georgia-Pacific mill in Crossett, Arkansas, caused a cluster of cancer incidents in the area around the mill.

In 2006, a Flint Hills Resources refinery in North Pole, Alaska was fined $16,000 by the EPA for 10 separate violations and was required to spend another $60,000 on safety equipment.

Workers at Georgia-Pacific, a corporate subsidiary of Koch, Inc., have claimed that they have developed mesothelioma caused by asbestos in Georgia-Pacific products.

Daniel Indiviglio in *The Atlantic* argues that the Bloomberg article is misleading, and that there are far more than only eight violations over the 63 years of the company's operation.

Koch, Inc. won the 2015 Conservation Education Award from the Wildlife Habitat Council and "has partnered with the company on conservation efforts for the past 15 years."


## Political activity

Fred C. Koch was a founder of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1958. His son, Charles Koch, who has been co-owner, chairman, and chief executive officer of Koch, Inc., co-founded the Cato Institute. The company also funds the political action committee KochPAC.

According to OpenSecrets, many of Koch, Inc.'s contributions have gone toward achieving legislation on taxes, energy and nuclear power, defense appropriations and financial regulatory reform. Koch Industries has been criticized by the environmentalist group Greenpeace for the role the company played in affecting climate change policy in the United States.

Prior to 2008, a Canadian subsidiary of Koch, Inc. contributed to the Fraser Institute, a conservative Canadian public policy think tank, according to the Institute's founder.

The company has opposed the regulation of financial derivatives, limits on greenhouse gases, and sponsors free market foundations and causes. Koch, Inc. has also come out against Low Carbon Fuel Standards. According to Koch, Inc., "LCFS would cripple refiners that rely on heavy crude feedstocks to provide the transportation fuels that keep America moving."

Charles Koch penned a *Wall Street Journal* op-ed column titled "Why Koch Industries is Speaking Out." The article states: "Because of our activism, we've been vilified by various groups. Despite this criticism, we're determined to keep contributing and standing up for those politicians, like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who are taking these challenges [deficit spending by governments] seriously."

According to the watchdog group Documented, in 2020 Koch, Inc. contributed $375,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fund-raising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association.
