## History

In January 2010, the Utah-based Phone Directories Company (PDC) entered into an agreement with Canpages and rebranded itself as Ziplocal. In March 2010, then-CEO of Canpages Olivier Vincent organized the sale of Canpages (including Ziplocal's assets) to Yellow Pages Group (YPG). YPG then traded its US division (YPG Directories, LLC.) to Ziplocal, LP in exchange for an equity-to-equity swap. YPG now owns 35% of Ziplocal. Vincent then left his position as CEO of Canpages and became CEO and President of the Board of Directors of Ziplocal.

Vincent was the CEO of Ziplocal until 2011, becoming the CEO of consulting firm Hipparcos Technology. Following Vincent, Mike Anderson, former SVP at Canpages, became CEO until 2012.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
