Owned by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), it first launched on 31 December 2007 as **TVB HD Jade**, before relaunching as **TVB J5** on 22 February 2016.

The channel primarily carried documentaries and financial news programmes. It later carried sports programming. On 22 April 2024, the channel was shut down and merged into TVB J2 to form TVB Plus. Its channel allotment was leased to Phoenix Hong Kong Channel.


## Background

The channel first launched on 31 December 2007 as **TVB HD Jade**, a high-definition spin-off of TVB Jade.

On 22 February 2016, with TVB Jade converting to HD full-time, HD Jade relaunched as **TVB J5**; the new channel was positioned as focusing on "wealth and knowledge", featuring entertainment and documentary programmes, and finance-related programming. TVB Pearl's Mandarin-language TVB News bulletin relocated to J5 on launch; the newscast also began to use Simplified Chinese for on-air graphics and subtitles after the move—a decision which generated criticism from viewers.

On 15 August 2017, TVB J5 was rebranded as **TVB Finance Channel**. On January 20, 2018, the channel was rebranded once again to **TVB Finance & Information Channel**.

On 13 April 2020, the Mandarin news moved back to TVB Pearl. On September 5, 2022, the channel was officially renamed TVB Finance, Sports & Information Channel, after having become the broadcaster of the Hong Kong Jockey Club and Mark Six drawings (replacing sister channel TVB J2).

In April 2024, it was announced that the channel would be shut down, with its content merged into TVB J2 to form TVB Plus beginning 22 April. In turn, the channel 85 allocation was rented to Phoenix Television, and began broadcasting Phoenix Hong Kong Channel.
