Schools at War


# Schools at War



The American **Schools at War** program was a program during World War II run by the U.S. Treasury Department, in which schoolchildren set goals to sell stamps and bonds to help the war effort. The program was also administered by the U.S. Office of Education, the Federal government agency that interfaced with the nation's school systems and its thirty-two million students. The Office, however, allowed the Treasury to work with the schools directly as the main objective of the program was raising money.

Planning for the program began before the December 1941 United States declaration of war on Japan. It started in earnest with the 1942–1943 school year. Students were taught that they could support the war effort in several ways. Their most important contribution was financial. Students bought war stamps and bonds with their spare change or earnings. However, more significantly, they were a sales force of millions selling to their families, neighbors, and communities. By the end of the war, they had raised over $2 billion (equivalent to $34.6 billion in 2023).

*Schools at War* supplied literature to teachers and posters that encouraged all aspects of the program. Individual schools were incentivized with a special flag to reach 90 percent student participation. School sponsorship of a particular item, such as a jeep or airplane, motivated sales. Tens of thousands of jeeps and hundreds of planes were "bought" under the program.


## Formation

The program was initially patterned on prior school savings programs. The Thrift stamp program of World War I facilitated, with 25-cent stamps, small-scale savings by children towards the eventual purchase of a larger five-dollar War Savings Certificate. The post-war period also saw the growth of the school savings bank movement, in which children were encouraged to save money by opening and regularly depositing into savings bank accounts through the school.¹⁷¹ The idea of a school saving program for World War II began before the U.S. entered the war. In July 1941, John W. Studebaker, the U.S. Commissioner of Education, outlined the cooperation between the Office of Education and the Treasury. The Treasury also cooperated on the Schools at War program with private organizations like the National Education Association, the American Council on Education, and the National Catholic Welfare Conference.¹⁷¹ The program was further refined in the spring of 1942 with the development of various publications about saving and conserving under wartime conditions.¹⁷²
Early pamphlets included:

* Stamps: How They Help Uncle Sam
* What You Should Know About U.S. Savings Stamps and Bonds

## Purpose

The Schools at War program was led by the director of the education division of the War Savings Staff of the Treasury Department, Homer W. Anderson, and was intended to unify and coordinate the effort of 30 million school children in support of the war effort. Children were expected to provide direct financial aid, as well as indirect support by receiving instruction in "good citizenship" and the "preservation of democracy". Teaching thrift, conservation, and war finance was considered "educationally sound" and therefore not in conflict with the schools' primary function.¹⁷²

The program used the slogan "Save, Serve, and Conserve". "Save" meant students were asked to save money to buy war saving stamps and bonds to pay for war material. "Serve" meant directly training in or performing war-related tasks such as providing first-aid, radio/telegraph communication, firefighting, enemy plane spotting, childcare, etc. "Conserve" referred to the wartime collection of materials such as scrap metal and rubber, aluminum, paper, string, cloth, kitchen fat, as well as reducing waste by repairing and reusing items like shoes and clothes.

According to a pamphlet published by the Treasury and Education Office, the program was meant to encourage schools to participate in the war effort, publicize their contributions through local, state, and national exhibitions, and recognize schools with program awards. A 1942 article published by the War Savings Staff of the Treasury Department said that the United States was fighting a "total war" in which every "man, woman, and child" was "in the fight". The Schools at War program was intended to "intensify and unify" the efforts of schools and students to make their activities "appear more vital" and see "the importance of his own contribution".


## Operation

Approximately ten months after the United States entered World War II upon the attack on Pearl Harbor, the program was inaugurated on September 25, 1942, with a parade in Washington, D.C., in which over 4,000 children marched to the U.S. Treasury Building to be greeted by first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, assistant Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr, and John W. Studebaker, the U.S. Commissioner of Education.¹⁵⁴
The program was in full operation in fall 1942, led by Homer W. Anderson, who had been the Superintendent of Public Instruction for St. Louis, Missouri. He was succeeded after a year by Daniel Melcher for the remainder of the war.¹⁷³

A school was formally enlisted in the program by returning a postcard. Activity was tracked in a "scrapbook", which could include a "written, pictorial, and statistical report" of the school's war-related activities and participation in the War Savings Program, and could be exhibited to the public. The scrapbooks were to be completed by January 7 to provide a prior year report to augment the president's annual State of the Union report. State exhibits of the scrapbooks were held on or about Washington's Birthday. The Treasury selected some scrapbooks, including that of Escanaba Senior High School in Delta County, Michigan, to be sent to schools in England to show students there how American students were supporting the war effort.

Every participating school would receive a "Certificate of Service" if its program sufficiently "stimulate[d] the regular voluntary purchase of War Stamps and Bonds by students and teachers". Every state was presented a "Liberty Brick" as further recognition of their schools' war services. The bricks were originally used in the construction of Independence Hall in Philadelphia that were replaced during a renovation, and were intended to be permanently displayed in the state capitals.

The smallest denomination war bond cost $18.75, redeemable after ten years for $25. Stamps were issued in denominations of 10, 25, and 50 cents which were purchased at face value and earned no interest. They were intended to be used as a savings mechanism to purchase a war bond eventually; savings books were provided which, when filled, held $18.75 in stamps, which then could be exchanged for a bond. The ten-cent stamps were issued primarily to encourage the participation of children.
