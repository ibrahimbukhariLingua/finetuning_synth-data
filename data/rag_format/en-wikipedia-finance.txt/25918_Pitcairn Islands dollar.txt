# Pitcairn Islands dollar



The Pitcairn Islands is a British overseas territory which uses the New Zealand dollar as its primary currency. However, the territory has issued commemorative **Pitcairn Islands dollar** coins since 1988. Although the Pitcairn Islands Dollar is legal tender and pegged at par to the New Zealand Dollar, it is not commonly used in general circulation and exists primarily to generate revenue for the territory coin collectors, with the sale of coins and other numismatic items being a major source of revenue for the territory. Having a population of only 50 according to the 2020 census, and with only one island in the group of four being populated, there is no need for local coinage. Coins consist of an important part of the Pitcairn Islands' tiny economy and help raise funds for the government's largely fixed and subsidised income.


## Coins

New Zealand coins and notes circulate in the Pitcairn Islands. However, the Pitcairn Islands began issuing its first denominational coin set in 2009. They were in six denominations of copper-plated bronze 5, and 10 Cents, nickel-plated bronze 20, and 50 Cents, and bronze $1, and $2 pieces. They come in Uncirculated and Proof conditions and could be acquired in packaged sets or in rolls. The reverse of each coin depicts a relic from H.M.A.V. *Bounty* along with its description and the coin's respective denomination. This is surrounded by a fine border.

The coins are of similar size, weight, and colouration to those of a similar set from Niue. The Pitcairn Islands set also has the addition of a 5 Cents piece which New Zealand no longer uses.

A majority of Pitcairn Islands coins are minted in New Zealand or in Australia. But many bullion commemoratives have also been made by the Royal Mint in the United Kingdom and other private mints under the order of the Pitcairn Islands Government.

The coin reverses depict as follows:

* 5 cents: *Bounty* Anchor
* 10 cents: *Bounty* ship's bell
* 20 cents: Bounty Bible
* 50 cents: Pitcairn longboat
* 1 dollar: *Bounty* cannon
* 2 dollars: H.M.A.V. *Bounty*'s Helm

After 2022, King Charles III is depicted on all coins of the Pitcairn Islands as Head of State and King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of which the Pitcairn Islands are a territory.

Although the coins are not circulating on the island, the coin sets may be purchased at the Pitcairn Islands General Post Office in the capital of Adamstown.

In 2021, the Pitcairn Islands started issuing Pound and Pence-denominated pieces. These are however not legal tender as the Currency Ordinance of the Pitcairn Islands prescribes that the islands can only issue legal tender coins that have a denomination in Dollars and Cents.
