Algerian budju


# Algerian budju



The **budju** (Arabic: بوجو, romanized: *būjū*) was the currency of Algeria until 1848. It was subdivided into 24 *muzuna*, each of 2 *kharub* or 29 *asper*. It was replaced by the franc when the country was occupied by France.


## Coins

In the early 19th century, copper coins were issued in denominations of 2 and 5 aspers, billon 1 kharub, silver 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 muzuna, 1 and 2 budju, and gold 1⁄4, 1⁄2 and 1 *sultani*.
