# Duncan MacMillan (businessman)



**Duncan MacMillan** is an American mathematician, philanthropist, and businessman known for being one of the four founders of Bloomberg L.P. MacMillan is not to be confused with Whitney Duncan MacMillan, who inherited his billions in agribusiness.


## Early life and education

MacMillan served four years in the United States Marine Corps after which he went to college. In 1966, MacMillan earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from Rutgers University. In 1967, he began his career working at Bankers Trust.


## Career

MacMillan worked at the investment bank Salomon Brothers with Michael Bloomberg, Thomas Secunda and Charles Zegar. After Bloomberg - who was Salomon's former head of equity trading and sales and then head of computer systems and data - was fired when he opposed the takeover of the company by Phibro, a metals trading company, he invited Zegar, Secunda, and Macmillan to start up their own financial data company. They accepted and together they founded Innovative Market Systems, with Bloomberg investing $300,000, the majority of seed capital. Secunda, who was a mathematician, was responsible for analytics; MacMillan was the expert in customer needs; and Zegar created the software. In 1982, they got their first customer, Merrill Lynch who ordered 20 data terminals and invested $30 million in the company (receiving a 30 percent ownership interest). The company grew rapidly thereafter and presently has $7.6B in sales and over 15,000 employees. Bloomberg owns 88% of the company and the three other partners 4% each (In 2008, Bloomberg purchased back Merrill Lynch's original 30% share).
