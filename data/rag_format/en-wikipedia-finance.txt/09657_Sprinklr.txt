**Sprinklr** is an American software company that develops a software as a service (SaaS) customer experience management (CXM) platform. The company's software, also called Sprinklr, combines different applications for social media marketing, social advertising, content management, collaboration, employee advocacy, customer care, social media research, and social media monitoring.

Sprinklr was founded in 2009 by technology executive Ragy Thomas. On June 23, 2021, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CXM.


## History

In 2009, Sprinklr was founded by Ragy Thomas, a technology marketing executive previously with email marketing company Bigfoot International. Thomas initially funded the company himself, with servers operating out of the basement of his home. The company's name came from the metaphor of a brand carefully watering its social media presence. Early customers included Cisco, Dell, and Virgin America.

In March 2015, the company announced the launch of its Experience Cloud platform, a way for companies to manage interactions over 23 social media channels and websites.

In April 2017, the company expanded from social media management to customer experience management, with the launch of new products for its Experience Cloud platform, ranging from social listening tools to content marketing.

In October 2017, the company added eight additional products integrated with Experience Cloud.

In April 2018, Sprinklr released artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities called Sprinklr Intuition, allowing the automatic collection and analysis of social media data.

As of October 2018, it was reported that the company had over 1,500 customers.

In May 2019, the company released Product Insights, an AI capability that automatically categorizes customer comments across social media and review sites about product feedback related to design, packaging, performance or features.

As of December 2019, the company reported over 1,500 employees, and 25 offices in 15 countries, located across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.

In 2020, Sprinklr offered case tracking services to the Kerala government in India, as part of an app to assist with managing the COVID-19 outbreak. In April 2020, the opposition party to the government accused the company of compromising patient data related to COVID-19 patients, and criticized the services for being awarded without following proper procedures. The company denied the charges, claiming that the data used in its platform is owned and controlled by the government and stored in India, in compliance with India's data privacy regulations. The government confirmed with the Kerala High Court through an affidavit that the Covid-related data was managed by Kerala's Centre for Development of Imaging Technology (C-DIT) in the Amazon Web Services cloud, and that no Sprinklr employees had any access to the data.

On June 23, 2021, Sprinklr began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CXM.
