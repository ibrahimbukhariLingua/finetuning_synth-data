## History

Founded in 1969 under the name of *EX Offices de distribution*, the chain became Intermarché in 1973.

On 9 June 2009, Les Mousquetaires announced the extension of the Intermarché brand to all their grocery subsidiaries, except Netto. Now Intermarché decline is based on the sales floor, as well as its location.

The old food stores owned by Les Mousquetaires under several brands, as well as the existing Intermarché stores have been divided into several groups:

* Intermarché Hyper for the largest stores between 3,200 m² and 6,000 m²
* Intermarché Super around 2,000 m², for most Intermarché stores
* Intermarché Express convenience stores installed in city centers
* Intermarché Contact convenience stores in rural areas which mostly replace Écomarché stores.

On 8 October 2014, ITM Intermarché and the Casino Group announced an agreement to rally their purchases together toward suppliers in France. This alliance makes these two groups the first retail purchaser in the country with a market share of 25.8%.

In January 2024, 190 Casino and Géant Casino stores are purchased by Intermarché.

## Écomarché

The Écomarché chain of supermarkets was created in 1969 and developed in 1986. They were similar to Intermarché, but mostly on a smaller scale than most supermarkets in France with a sales area between 400 and 1800 m². The target of the Écomarché chain was to compensate for the lack of local shops and to focus upon customer care, attention to the product, quality, choice and the environment.

From 2009, the Écomarché chain became two brands of the Intermarché, either *Intermarché Contact* if smaller than 1,500 square meters or *Intermarché Super* if bigger. The other Écomarché stores in urban areas became *Intermarché Express* or *Intermarché Super* (if larger than 1,500 sq. meters).

Écomarché stores could be found in Belgium, Portugal and France, which all became Intermarché Contact or Express.
