## History

Toivo Sukari and Tamperean businessman Toni Virkkunen had the idea to build the Ideapark in 2003. Sukari, who also owns the Maskun Kalustetalo chain, took on the greatest financial responsibility and the role of a caretaker in the Ideapark project. At the end of 2004, he sold properties for about €25,000,000 to finance the construction of Ideapark. Outsiders had no faith in Ideapark, and no bank loan was received until two years after the start of the project.

An article by *Etelä-Suomen Sanomat* from July 2007 states that the construction costs of the project were approximately €120,000,000. Ideapark's rental income was reported to be approximately EUR 15 million per year and the total value approximately €200,000,000. There were 185 shops in Ideapark at that time. The Sukari and Viitala companies jointly own the Lempäälä Ideapark. Kiinteistö Oy Ideapark made a profit for the first time in 2009, when in the financial year ended January 2010 the profit amounted to €440,000, while in previous years the loss amounted to several million euros annually.
