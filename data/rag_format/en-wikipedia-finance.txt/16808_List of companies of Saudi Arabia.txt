List of companies of Saudi Arabia


# List of companies of Saudi Arabia



Saudi Arabia is a sovereign Arab state in Western Asia constituting the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula. The country's command economy is petroleum-based but slowly diversifying; in 2017 58% of budget revenues and 85% of export earnings came from the oil industry. The country plans to reduce oil-based revenues to 42% by 2023. A considerable proportion of Saudi companies are owned by families, including the royal family.

Public companies are listed on the Tadawul. For further information on the types of business entities in this country and their abbreviations, see "Business entities in Saudi Arabia".
