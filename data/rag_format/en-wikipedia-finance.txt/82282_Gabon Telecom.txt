## History

Gabon Telecom SA is the national historic telecommunications operator of Gabon. It was established in 2001 following the division of the Postal and Telecommunications Office, as stipulated by Act No. 004/2001 of 27 June 2001, which reorganized the postal and telecommunications sector.

In March 1999, Gabon Telecom launched Libertis, its mobile brand. Following an international tender in February 2007, the Gabonese state sold 51% of the companyâ€™s shares to Maroc Telecom. In December 2010, the agreements signed between Morocco Telecom and the Gabonese state in 2008 were finalized.

In December 2011, Gabon Telecom merged with its subsidiary Mobile Libertis, and in July 2016, it further merged with Atlantic Telecom Gabon (MOOV), a subsidiary of the Etisalat Group. This pooling of resources was completed by the end of 2016.


## Operations

Gabon Telecom provides a wide range of services, including fixed telephony (voice and data), mobile telephony, and broadband internet. It remains the only fixed telephony operator in Gabon and operates mobile services under the Libertis and Moov brands. These mobile services include prepaid, postpaid, voice, data services, and international roaming.

The company also offers broadband internet access through its wired network, particularly ADSL, and benefits from access to the SAT-3 submarine cable to meet international bandwidth needs. This enables Gabon Telecom to provide international internet and voice services to other telecom operators.
