Canceled denominations of United States currency


# Canceled denominations of United States currency



The United States has several coins and banknotes which were proposed at one time but never adopted.


## Banknotes

A three dollar bill was proposed two times during the 1860s. A design was engraved for a potential $3 United States Note, and a 1865 law called for a $3 National Bank Note, but neither proposal came to fruition.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
