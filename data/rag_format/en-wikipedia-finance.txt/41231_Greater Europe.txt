# Greater Europe



**Greater Europe** refers to the idea of an extended Europe that generally implies a Europe transcending traditional geographic boundaries to include trans-Eurasian countries, or countries in close proximity to Continental Europe with strong political, economic, or cultural links to Europe.


## Definitions

## Economic integration in greater Europe


### Lisbon Vladivostok initiative

The vision of a common economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok has been debated since the 1950s. The Lisbon Vladivostok Initiative believes that this vision can be turned into reality, and sees a multi-level partnership between the European Union (EU) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) as the core aspect of a common economic space. Cooperation between the EU and EAEU could bring enormous benefits for trade and business in Europe and Eurasia. The Initiative was founded in 2015 and is driven by businesses, business associations, and think tanks from member countries of the EU and EAEU. Among the founding members are the German-Russian Forum, the German Chamber of Commerce, and the German Eastern Business Association, as well as international corporations such as Siemens, Bosch, Severstal and others. Today, the Initiative counts on more than 100 members from 12 countries from the EU and EAEU. It sees itself as an open circle involving all countries from Lisbon to Vladivostok.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


#### Goals of the Lisbon Vladivostok initiative

The markets of the EU and the EAEU cover more than 630 million inhabitants. Despite different levels of development of the two unions, by creating lasting networks between officials, maintaining continual dialogue, and through the establishment of a common economic area in the countries of the EU and the EAEU, it may be possible to combat European and Eurasian issues of the future more effectively.
