## Sup De Luxe

The Institut Supérieur de Marketing du Luxe was founded by Alain-Dominique Perrin, in collaboration with Cartier in 1990. By creating the Institut Supérieur de Marketing du Luxe, Cartier first trained a large number of its managers and then offered other brands creative profiles with the values of the sector.

Sup de luxe was the first educational institute in France specialising in the luxury management. The absence of luxury management schools is what gave Perrin his initial idea of founding the school. Its initial aim was to produce young managers and experts in the luxury field and to stimulate research into luxury on a global scale.
