## History

The Satsuma brand was launched by Provident Personal Credit in 2013. Provident had been in the business of providing small doorstep loans since 1880s.

Satsuma had £5 million of loans as of 2015, increasing from £1.8 million the previous year.

Between 2014 and 2016 Satsuma Loans sponsored RFU Championship side Yorkshire Carnegie in a deal worth £600,000. In 2016 it was announced that Satsuma Loans would become an official partner of Sunderland A.F.C. This prompted Sharon Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West, to write to the club warning that associating themselves with a high-interest lender would undermine their positive community engagement work.

Satsuma was closed down in 2021.
