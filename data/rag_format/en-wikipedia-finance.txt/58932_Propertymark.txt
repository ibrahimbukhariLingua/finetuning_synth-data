# Propertymark



**Propertymark** (formerly National Association of Estate Agents or NAEA) is a membership organisation for estate agents (called *real estate brokers* in the US). It is based in and covers the UK. It is the UK's leading professional body for estate agents. Its members practice across all aspects of property in the UK, including residential and commercial sales and letting, property management, business transfer, auctioneering and land.

Founded in 1962 by estate agent and entrepreneur Raymond Andrews, the NAEA was established with the goal of upholding good practice and high professional standards in UK estate agency. This struck a chord with the industry at a time when there was little representation for estate agents and has allowed the Association to grow phenomenally over the years.


## Propertymark

Propertymark launched in February 2017 combining Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA), National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA), National Association of Valuers and Auctioneers (NAVA), Institution of Commercial and Business Agents (ICBA), Association of Professional Inventory Providers (APIP) and NFoPP Awarding Body into a single brand in order to achieve a greater consumer awareness.
