## Activities

Transatel enables mobile services (BtoB) as an MVNE/A or M2M enabler, and provides mobile services (BtoC) through its own MVNOs.


### Enabler of mobile services: BtoB activities


#### MVNE

In Europe, Transatel enables access to the following MNO networks for voice, SMS and data services

* Orange France – France
* EE (formerly T-Mobile UK and Orange UK) – United Kingdom
* Salt (formerly Orange CH) – Switzerland
* Mobistar (Orange) – Belgium
* Tango – Luxembourg

In addition, Transatel delivers added value services around provisioning, prepaid and post-paid billing, as well as fixed-mobile convergence.

The enabler activity follows two different business models, according to clients' needs: the pure enabler model (MVNE) and the aggregator model (MVNA) for companies wishing to launch and monetize a mobile offer under their brand, be it prepaid or post-paid.

When an MVNO wishes to purchase airtime directly from a Mobile Network Operator (MNO), Transatel acts as the MVNE (MVNO enabler)—the technical provider servicing either the MNO or the MVNO.

Transatel's MVNE references include:

* Life Mobile
* Post Office Mobile
* Now Mobile
* Colruyt Mobile or Ortel

##### MVNA

As an MVNA, (MVNO Aggregator) Transatel purchases mobile airtime in bulk from a partner mobile operator, adding the value of its service platform, and wholesales this airtime to multiple MVNOs. Each MVNO in turn sells the mobile service to consumers or companies. The MVNA activity is concentrated in Europe, particularly France, the UK and Switzerland.

Major clients include The People's Operator (TPO), China Telecom Europe, Sewan, Paritel and Netcom.


#### Machine to Machine connectivity

In 2011, Transatel entered the Machine to machine (M2M) arena, using its existing MVNE infrastructure across Europe to provide M2M services along similar business models. Transatel enables M2M players to include airtime connectivity to their services, as well as a range of applications, such as fleet and asset tracking, vehicle telematics, smart metering, entertainment, telehealth.

Today, Transatel manages over 1 million SIM cards related to its M2M activity. Its largest client is EE in the UK.


#### Internet of Things

To date, Transatel has signed agreements with three of the top ten worldwide laptop/tablet OEMs, with commercial soft launches planned in Q1 2016 with Windows 10, targeting the consumer and SME segments.


### Provider of mobile services: BtoC activities


#### MVNO

Precursor to the Eurotariff, and the Digital Single Market Strategy, Transatel has paved the way for low-cost transnational mobile communications, by being the first operator to offer calls to and from other countries within the European Union.

Transatel Mobile was created in 2000 for border dwellers and frequent travelers to solve problems associated with roaming charges applied in France, Switzerland and the Benelux Union. The influx of workers commuting between these geographic locations, paired with their obligation to stay connected, created a need for a mobile connectivity solution.ᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ By offering a multi-number SIM card that allows cross-border commuters to place calls at local rates and receive calls for free in four countries, Transatel is able to contribute to the facilitation of trade and the circulation of workers across European borders (Schengen).

In 2010, Transatel decided to address foreign travelers visiting France, and later the European Union, by developing LeFrenchMobile. The creation of the new mobile phone service that allowed Transatel to provide mobile communications on a larger scale by giving students, workers and tourists from around the world the ability to contact their original country while in France or in the European Union.

International travelers depend on mobile apps such as TripAdvisor, Uber and Facebook in addition to placing calls. Travelers need to constantly stay connected the internet.

In April 2015, Transatel created Transatel DataSIM. The brand exclusively offers mobile internet access and allows users to connect to 3G/4G networks in 130 destinations (to date) at local rates. Unlike Transatel's previous offers, Transatel DataSIM was designed to be used throughout the world. To reach the goal of providing global connectivity, the French SME signs new agreements every month with national mobile operators around the world.

Bitebird was launched in June 2016 by Transatel and Air France KLM dedicated to frequent travellers. Based on the Transatel 901 system, Bitebird offers a 4G hotspot with a SIM card that can be used at local rates in over 100 destinations.
