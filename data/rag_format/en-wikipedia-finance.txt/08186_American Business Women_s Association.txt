American Business Women's Association


# American Business Women's Association



The **American Business Women's Association** is a national professional association for women, established by Kansas City businessman, Hilary Bufton Jr.

On Sept. 22, 1949, Mr. Bufton and three Kansas City businesswomen incorporated the American Business Women's Association.

“It was my feeling all women were seeking and deserved equal business opportunities.” He later wrote: “They had gained tremendous business knowledge during World War II, through necessity, and I felt a new organization for all businesswomen was needed.”

ABWA is the first women's association to offer an online learning portal with interactive management modules that will teach members new skills they can immediately apply as ABWA team leaders and use in the workplace. Launched in April 2009 as part of the ABWA Web site, online training courses offered include "Resumes That Get Interviews," " Interviews That Get Offers," "Managing Team Conflict" and "Making Group Decisions."


## National Recognition

National recognition is one of the four tenets of the association's mission. Members have the opportunity to run for national office for a seat on the organization's National Board of Directors.

Members also compete for the Top 10 Business Women of ABWA based on personal and professional achievements. Every year, ABWA groups nominate one accomplished member as a candidate for the Top Ten Business Women of ABWA.

From the ten finalists, the American Business Woman of ABWA is chosen. The Top Ten are introduced at the Association's annual meeting, the National Women's Leadership Conference.


## National Publications

ABWA offers a varied collection of informational tools to their members. *Women in Business*, the award-winning national magazine of ABWA, offers articles on a blend of personal and professional development topics. Published three times a year, *Women in Business* features a continuing education department focused on business and market-relevant topics.

Members also enjoy custom-designed online newsletters to serve the individual needs of different groups: *Express Network* for busy professionals, and a District Newsletter to keep members informed of news from the district level.
