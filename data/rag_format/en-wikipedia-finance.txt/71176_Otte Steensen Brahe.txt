Otte Steensen Brahe


# Otte Steensen Brahe



**Otte Steensen Brahe** (12 April 1578 – 5 July 1651), also known as **Otto Brahe**, was a Danish landowner and money lender. He owned Næsbyholm, Bavelse and Tersløsegaard on Zealand.


## Early life and education

Otto Brahe was born on 12 April 1578 at Næsbyholm, the son of privy counsellor Steen Brahe (1547–1620) and Birgitte Rosenkrantz (1555–88). He attended Sorø Academy from 1587 and later continued his education in Aarhus. In 1593–99, Brahe and Kurt Aslaksen went on a grand tour in Europe, studying at the universities in Rostock (1593), Herborn (from spring of 1594), Heidelberg, Basel, Geneve and Orleans (1599). He also visited England and Scotland. In 1600–02, he was a courtier at Frederick V of the Palatinate.


## Military service

During the Kalmar War, Brahe served as cornet in the heavy cavalry. He lost an arm in the Battle of Kalmar.


## Property

Brahe inherited the estates Næsbyholm and Tersløsegaard after his parents. His holdings were in 1638 valued at 1,639 *tænder hartkorn*. He increased the size of the Næsbyholm estate significantly through the acquisition of more land. At the time of his death in 1651, it was valued at 930 *tønder hartkorn*.

Through his third marriage he also acquired Ravnholt on Funen. In 1623, he sold the estate to privy counsellor Holger Rosenkrantz.

From the 1620s, he engaged in large-scale moneylending to his peers and seems even to have speculated in sanctioning obligations. Together with people such as Niels Trolle and Frederik Parsberg, he belonged to a narrow circle of wealthy noblemen who dominated the Danish lending market after the access loans from Holstein and the "king's own coffin" stopped after the Thirty Years' War.
