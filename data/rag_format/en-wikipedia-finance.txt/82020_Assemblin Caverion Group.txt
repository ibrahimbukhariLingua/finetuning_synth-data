Thereafter, the Swedish company Assemblin grew through several mergers between Sydtotal, Närkes Elektriska (NEA) and Imtech.


### Finland

Caverion acquired companies like EMC Talotekniikka Oy, Maintpartner, Huurre and Pelsu Pelastussuunnitelma. Assemblin Caverion's national office for Finland is located in Vapaala, Vantaa.

The Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are part of the Finnish organisation.

Caverion's Norwegian history goes back to Frognerkilens Fabrikk, established in Oslo- Skøyen in 1873. Since then, a series of company acquisitions were carried out: Norsk Elektrisk Aktiebolag, Drammens Rørleggerforretning, Elektrisk Bureau AS, Per Kure A/S, Norsk Viftefabrikk AS, Elektro Union, Eneas and Esco were fused in. Together these have led to today's Caverion Norge, which is located in Oslo-Etterstad.
