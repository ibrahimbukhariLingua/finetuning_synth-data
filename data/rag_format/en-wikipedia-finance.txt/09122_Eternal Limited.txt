# Eternal Limited



**Eternal Limited** (formerly **Zomato Limited**) is a listed Indian multinational company. It is the parent company of Zomato, blinkit, District and Hyperpure apps.


## History


### Early years (2008–2011)

Eternal was founded as **FoodieBay** in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.

With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Eternal (then Zomato) also launched *zomato.xxx*, a site dedicated to food porn. Later in 2011, Eternal officially launched an online ticketing platform for events.


### Expansion (2011–2015)

In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad. In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka, Qatar, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and South Africa. In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand, Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages. In April 2014, it was launched in Chile and Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland in 2015.

In January 2015, Eternal acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia. This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.


### Late 2010s

In 2015, Eternal started its food delivery service in India, initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have their own delivery service.

In April 2015, Eternal (then Zomato) acquired the American online table reservation platform NexTable, which was subsequently renamed Zomato Book. In January 2016, it launched Zomato Book's table reservation feature on its application in India. In April 2015, it acquired cloud-based point of sale (PoS) company MapleGraph Solutions, and, in April 2016, launched its own version of PoS for restaurant owners called Zomato Base, comprising menu and inventory management, payment system, and analytics. Later that year, Eternal (then Zomato) acquired Sparse Labs (renamed Zomato Trace) and integrated the latter's real-time delivery location tracking technology on its food delivery platform.

In February 2017, the firm announced plans to launch Zomato Infrastructure Services, a cloud kitchen infrastructure service to help partner restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs. Later that year, it introduced a paid membership program called *Zomato Gold* using which subscribers could get offers and discounts on dining and food delivery at Eternal's partner restaurants.

In 2018, Eternal (then Zomato) shut down operations of Zomato Infrastructure Services. The company then acquired WOTU and rebranded it as Hyperpure to supply food ingredients such as grains, vegetables and meat to restaurants from its warehouses. In December 2018, Eternal (then Zomato) launched its annual multi-city food and entertainment carnival called Zomaland.

In March 2019, Eternal sold its UAE food delivery business to Talabat. In September 2019, the firm laid off almost 10% of its workforce (540 people) tending to back-end activities like customer service, merchant and delivery partner support functions.


### 2020s

Eternal (then Zomato) closed operations of Zomato Market in June 2020 as demand for food delivery recovered and grocery delivery business "was not scalable". In April 2021, it pulled out of alcohol delivery service citing poor unit economics and scalability.

In July 2021, Eternal went public, opening its initial public offering at a valuation of over US$8 billion.

In November 2021, Eternal announced that it would cease its services in all countries except India and the United Arab Emirates. By early 2024, it had completed the liquidation of more than 10 overseas subsidiaries, which were primarily focused on restaurant discovery and reviews.

In April 2022, Eternal (then Zomato) launched a pilot of 10-minute food delivery in Gurgaon called Zomato Instant. In June 2022, Zomato announced the acquisition of quick-commerce company Blinkit for US$568 million.

In June 2023, Eternal launched a feature that enabled users to build carts from up to four restaurants and place the order together. In October 2023, the company started offering hyperlocal package delivery service on a separate app called Xtreme.

In August 2024, Eternal announced the launch of its events and ticketing app called "District" after acquiring Paytm's ticketing business.

In February 2025, Zomato Limited was renamed as Eternal Limited.
