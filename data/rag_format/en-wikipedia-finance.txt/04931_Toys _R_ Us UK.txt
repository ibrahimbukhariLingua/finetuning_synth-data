# Toys "R" Us UK



 **Toys "R" Us** is a British retailer owned by WHP Global. It was founded by its U.S. counterpart in 1984, but in 2018, the retailer closed all locations but was later revived in 2021, eventually leading to physical Toys "R" Us concessions opening in WHSmith stores.


## History

The first Toys "R" Us store in the United Kingdom opened in 1985.ᵇᵉᵗᵗᵉʳˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ At its peak, the chain had over 105 stores in the country. They were operated by Toys "R" Us Limited.

On December 4, 2017, the company reported that it would be liquidating and closing at least 26 stores in the United Kingdom as part of an insolvency restructuring known as a company voluntary arrangement.


### Closure

After amassing £15 million in unpaid taxes, Toys "R" Us Limited entered administration on February 28, 2018, after failing to find a buyer. On March 2, 2018, it was announced that all UK stores would begin a liquidation sale, and on March 14, 2018, it was announced that all UK stores were expected to close within six weeks. On April 24, 2018, Toys "R" Us stopped trading in the United Kingdom after 33 years of service. All stores were closed by April 24, 2018.


### Revival

On 28 October 2021, Toys "R" Us announced plans to reopen its UK arm, initially through online purchasing from its Australian arm, then with physical branches opening from 2022 onwards. The online store reopened the following year, and this was followed up with a deal with WHSmith to open up Toys "R" Us branded concessions inside nine WHSmith stores. Following the trial being a success, 39 more concessions will be opening. With the first 17 coming soon and are now on the Toys R Us website. The first of three new stores opened May 25, 2024. Two more stores opened on June 1, 2024. In December 2024, they expanded their deal with WHSmith to sell Geoffrey gifts on FunkyPigeon.com.
