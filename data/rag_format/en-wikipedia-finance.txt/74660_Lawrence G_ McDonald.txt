### *How to Listen When Markets Speak: Risks, Myths and Investment Opportunities in a Radically Reshaped Economy*

Following the success of his previous novel, Lawrence published another book in spring of 2024. In *How to Listen When Markets Speak* Lawrence proposes the world is entering a high inflationary paradigm, using anecdotes from previous conversations with famous investors throughout his career and various economic trends as evidence.

He suggests (some of) the factors driving this change are:

* The west printing too many banknotes through Quantitative Easing (he notes that 40% of all US dollars were created between 2022 and 2024)
* A shift of industry from the west (especially America) to China
* America's overuse of sanctions resulting in a debasement of the Dollar as a reserve currency, resulting in foreign nations moving towards alternatives (namely the Yuan) to avoid the impact on their trade when these sanctions are used.

He suggests (some of) the effects will be:

* A Multi-polar world, in which America lacks to political power to maintain peace and prosperity for its allies. This will contribute to a higher frequency of warfare (he uses The war in Ukraine as an example). He speculates this will increase the cost of trade and damage the 'just in time' economy of the west.
* A megatrend tailwind in which growth stocks and passive investments become bearish
* An end of the 60% stocks 40% bonds "rule of thumb" portfolio

He suggests that readers should (among other things):

* Invest in "cold, hard assets", including rare minerals like lithium and cobalt (used in batteries), as well as gold and copper.
* Invest in some large mining companies.
* Move into value investments, which perform better in a high inflationary world.
* Have a 10% cash, 40% stocks, 30% bonds, 20% commodities portfolio for the 2020-2030 decade.

He also suggests that its 'too early' to switch to renewables, especially for countries like India, and thus Petroleum will continue to be an essential resource throughout the next decade.

The book was published in audio format on Spotify, read by Larry himself.
