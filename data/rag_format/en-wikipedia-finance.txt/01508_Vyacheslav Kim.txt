## Kaspi.kz

In 1993, Vyacheslav Kim opened the Planet of Electronics Store, which became the country's largest store in less than a decade, but Kim wanted more: he knew that sales could be increased by giving loans to people. After the USSR collapsed, Kazakhstan was going through difficult times: per capita GDP was contracting from 1990 until 2000. Stores could not give their own loans, so they began to buy banking organizations. In 2002, Vyacheslav Kim made a deal with the newly privatized local Bank Kaspiyskiy. However, it was not so easy to combine trade and lending. The entrepreneur began seeking investment partners who might help him, and learned about the Baring Vostok Fund, which acquired a stake in the company. This led to Mikheil Lomtadze joining the management team in 2007, who together with Vyacheslav Kim transformed Kaspi to the biggest Kazakhstan fintech company.

The President emphasized the importance of using technological innovations in Kaspi.kz activities. One year later, on February 26, 2021, President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev held a second meeting with the Kaspi.kz founders Vyacheslav Kim and Mikheil Lomtadze during which promising areas of joint activity of the state bodies and Kaspi.kz were identified, including in the development of non-cash payments in Kazakhstan.
