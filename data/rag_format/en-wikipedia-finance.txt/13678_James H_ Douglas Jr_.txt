He served as Deputy Secretary of Defense until the close of the Eisenhower Administration in January 1961.


## Secretary of the Air Force

In May 1957, President Eisenhower appointed him as the fifth Secretary of the Air Force. He was the first Secretary of the Air Force to have previously served as a military air service officer. As Secretary of the Air Force, Douglas helped establish the United States Air Force Academy. He authorized the Air Force Commendation Medal to replace the Army version of the award. Douglas advised the President regarding a course of action in response to The Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik I in October 1957. He also reaffirmed the 1925 court-martial verdict against air power advocate Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. He said the court was correct to have found Mitchell guilty of publicly attacking his superiors, but noted that time had proved Mitchell was right about the unique value of air power.

During his tenure as Secretary of The Air Force, Douglas also strengthened the force of The Strategic Air Command (SAC) as its main role as United States primary nuclear deterrence. As a result several of The Air Force bases are being transferred into Strategic Air Command's jurisdiction such as Bunker Hill Air Force Base in Indiana (later known as Grissom Air Force Base) and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Under the direction of Secretary Douglas, SAC also relocated its headquarters in Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska from A Building to Building 500 (Now known as General Curtis E. LeMay Building) and received additional construction to modified its main command and control center, including SAC's underground command bunker. SAC also received additional fund to construct a new Post-Attack Command and Control System Facility, also known as The Notch in Hadley, Massachusetts and new Communications Annex Facility at Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts.

In 1956 SAC received its new high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft Martin RB-57D Canberra and in 1957 as part of The New Look massive retaliation program, Secretary Douglas ordered SAC's fleet of RB-57D to be relocated into Rhein-Main Air Force Base in West Germany in order to conduct reconnaissance missions within The Soviet Union Satellite Nations. During Douglas's tenure as Secretary of The Air Force, SAC also received a new strategic bomber aircraft, the Convair B-58 Hustler, the first strategic bomber aircraft with a capability to fly into Mach 2 speed and also a new tanker aircraft, the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, to replace the KC-97 Stratofreighter. The Air Force also received several new fighter aircraft such as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II during Douglas's tenure as Secretary of The Air Force.

In April 1959, the secretary of the air force issued implementing instructions to USAF to deploy two Jupiter squadrons to Italy. The two squadrons, totaling 30 missiles, were deployed at 10 sites in Italy from 1961 to 1963. In October 1959, the location of the third and final Jupiter MRBM squadron was settled when a government-to-government agreement was signed with Turkey. The U.S. and Turkey concluded an agreement to deploy one Jupiter squadron on NATO's southern flank (PGM-19 Jupiter). The deployment of US nuclear armed missiles in Turkey triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis. Douglas served as Secretary of the Air Force until the end of 1959.

Douglas also emphasized the importance role of the Air Force during the Second Indochina War which later became known as The Vietnam War. Douglas also suggested that strengthening the air power and the buildup of South Vietnam Air Force would eventually could help the South Vietnam push back the North Vietnamese communist forces. In 1957 under Secretary Douglas's direction, the Air Force sent several of their airmen in order to act as advisory and to train the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) and the RVNAF also began to receive several new U.S.-made aircraft such as the T-28A/B Trojan.
