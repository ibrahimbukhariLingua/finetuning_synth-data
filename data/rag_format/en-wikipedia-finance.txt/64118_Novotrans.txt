# Novotrans



**Novotrans Group of Companies** is a large-scale Russian transportation and logistic enterprise. It provides freight railway operations using its own massive rolling stock, stevedoring operations, as well as carriage construction and maintenance. The holding comprises over 30 companies in various regions of Russia and CIS employing a workforce exceeding 5,000 individuals. It is headed by the President Konstantin Goncharov.


## History

The company was established in 2004 as a railway operator focused on coal transportation.

Over the following years, the company expanded its operations by commissioning several freight car repair and maintenance depots: in 2008 in Tayturka, Irkutsk oblast; in 2009 — in Prokopyevsk, Kemerovo oblast; in 2012 — in Biysk, Altai krai; in 2013 — in Kashira, Moscow oblast.

In 2015, Konstantin Goncharov acquired Novotrans, leading to the formation of the Novotrans Group of Companies. Later that year, the Group of Companies consolidated its wagon maintenance capabilities under the newly established entity — Novotrans Wagon Maintenance and Repair Company.

In 2018, Novotrans began the construction of the Lugaport multipurpose marine terminal, located in Luga Bay, Leningrad oblast. This project saw significant progress when, in January 2020, JSC Ust-Luga Company — originally founded in 1992 to oversee the Ust-Luga sea trade port project — became part of the Novotrans holding. By 2023–2024, the first phase of construction was completed, including the commissioning of piers 1, 2, 3 along with associated infrastructure.

In 2019, Novotrans was appointed as the general agent of Rosmorport (Russian government seaport operator) managing stevedoring services on the ferry route between Ust-Luga and the port of Baltiysk in Kaliningrad oblast.

At the start of 2020, the Group of Companies completed the second phase of the Kuzbass Wagon Repair and Maintenance Enterprise (КВРП) increasing its capacity to 30 thousand railcars annually and making it the largest wagon maintenance and repair facility in Russia.
