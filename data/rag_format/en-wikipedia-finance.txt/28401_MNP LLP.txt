## History


### Early history

The roots of MNP LLP date back to 1945, when Winnipeg-based Laird, Sprague & Co opened an office in Brandon, Manitoba. The Brandon office became independent in 1957 when the balance of Laird, Sprague joined Montreal's McDonald Currie & Co. (later merging with what is now known as PwC). Ron Meyers acquired full ownership of the Brandon office in 1958, and renamed the firm Meyers Dickens Norris Penny & Co. (MDNP) in 1969.
