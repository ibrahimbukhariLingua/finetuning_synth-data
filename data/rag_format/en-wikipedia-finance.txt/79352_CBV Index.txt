At the beginning of 2007, CBV-Index was introduced to the financial market of Vietnam by Bien Viet Securities. The Index was known as the first and only index that reflects the performance of the whole stock market of Vietnam, covering securities listed on the only two exchanges, Hanoi Securities Trading Center and Hochiminh Stock Exchange. Unlike indexes made by exchange houses as VN-Index and Hastc-Index, which are all market cap weighted, CBV Index was the first free-float market cap weighted index of Vietnam equity market. In March, 2007, CBV 20 and CBV 10 which form the part of CBV-Index was published in order to meet the demand for Index investors in Vietnam. CBV MidCap, CBV SmallCap for Mid-Cap and Small-Cap companies also came out at the same time. In April, 2007, the Council of Corporates and Businesses of Vietnam Indices was founded.
