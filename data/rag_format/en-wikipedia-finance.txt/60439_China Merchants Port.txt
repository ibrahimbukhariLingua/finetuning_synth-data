As part of China's "Maritime Silk Road" plan, the company has increased its overseas port facility upgrades in recent years. The sea routes, proposed by Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, aim to connect China to Europe via Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The company has acquired 49% stake in Terminal Link, the combination of Compagnie Maritime d'Affrètement (CMA) and Compagnie Générale Maritime (CGM), as well as the purchase of 90% stock in TCP Participações SA, A, the second largest container terminal in Brazil with a design capacity of 1.5 million TEU, for US$923.7 million.

### Port of Hambantota

The Hambantota International Port is a port in southern Sri Lanka, is located a few hundred kilometres off the coast of India, on a vital economic and military waterway. Construction and investment in the port have come from China, which first signed a US$1.3 billion agreement for the Hambantota port project in 2007, with financing from China Exim Bank and China Merchants Port, while China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC) is responsible for the construction of the port.

With the Port of Hambantota's expansion, China Merchants Port Holdings has become the major shareholder of the Hambantota Port. Sirisena, a member of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, negotiates with China Merchants Port and sells the government's majority stake in the terminal company. They signed an agreement with The Sri Lanka Port Authority in 2017 in which China Merchants Port leased the Port of Hambantota for operation for 99 years. At the same time, China Merchants Port purchase a 70% stake of the Hambantota Port from Sri Lankan government for $1.1 billion in July 2017, including the 42-hectares artificial island located at the port opening.

This new equity from China Merchants Port increased Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves and facilitated Sri Lanka's repayment of its debts to non-Chinese creditors.⁹⁶
