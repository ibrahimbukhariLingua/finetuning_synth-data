Founded in 2010 by Bom Kim, the company operates a retail business, food delivery service, and OTT streaming service, with offices in South Korea, Taiwan, the United States, India, and Singapore.

The company expanded into video streaming distribution with the launch of its Coupang Play service. Coupang is often referred to as the "Amazon of South Korea", due to its position and corporate size in the South Korean online market. Coupang was named to the Fortune 200 in 2023 and 2024.


## Overview

The first marketplace and largest online retailer in South Korea, Coupang's annual revenue as of 2021 is US$18.4 billion. The company's Rocket Delivery network provides same-day or next-day delivery of more than five million unique items. Coupang claims that 99.6 percent of its orders are delivered within 24 hours. 70% of Korean citizens live within 10 minutes of a Coupang logistic center.

Coupang was headquartered in Songpa District, Seoul, South Korea until 2022 when it relocated to Seattle in the US. The Seattle office opened in 2018 and grew to 350 employees within four years. Coupang also has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Los Angeles and Mountain View. It is incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law since 2010.

Coupang was founded by Bom Kim in 2010. A student of Harvard University, Kim started to study for his MBA at Harvard Business School but dropped out six months into the program.

Kim registered Coupang originally as a limited liability company in Delaware State, allowing to access US funding. In November 2018, Coupang received a US$2 billion investment from SoftBank. Other major investors in Coupang include BlackRock and Fidelity.

The company has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic with increased demand for online shopping. In July 2020, Coupang acquired the assets of Singaporean streaming service HOOQ to form the nucleus of its streaming service named Coupang Play.

Coupang had its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange on 11 March 2021.

On 4 June 2021, Coupang announced that it had started trial operations in Japan. However it pulled out of the country less than 2 years later due to low growth potential amid the dominance of Amazon and local player Rakuten. On 8 July 2021, the company launched in Taiwan.

On 18 December 2023, Coupang announced it would be acquiring online retailer Farfetch in a deal that would give Farfetch access to $500 million worth of capital. The deal comes as Farfetch faced potential administration, with previous talks with Swiss luxury group Richemont being terminated.


## Financials

The company announced in 2020 that its annual revenue in 2019 increased by 64.2 percent over the previous year, and totaled 7.15 trillion won ($5.9 billion). Its operating loss in 2019 dropped from 1.13 trillion won to 720.5 billion won, declining 36 percent. The gains were attributed to expanded fast delivery service across the nation, including the overnight Rocket Delivery; sales of home appliances and fresh food; and a steady increase in customers. The company had created 2,500 jobs in 2014 and 30,000 in 2019; labor costs increased correspondingly from 100 billion won in 2014 to 1.4 trillion won in 2019.

## Controversy


### Worker wellbeing

Coupang has been involved in complaints by activists and families of workers who allegedly died from overwork. In April 2021 Kwon Young-gook, a lawyer and the co-chairman at the Committee for Coupang Workers' Human Rights and Health, said "Seven Coupang employees and two subcontractors have died of cardiovascular disorders, such as heart attack, for the past year. ... Out of the nine deaths, five are connected to overnight work as they passed away during or after night duty." According to statistics published in the *Korea Economic Daily*, Coupang had recorded no work-accident deaths since its launch in 2011, as of the end of 2020.

In April 2021, the company introduced Coupang Care, a system that allows employees to take paid breaks and receive health care coaching.


### Item Winner system

There is a debate over Coupang's Item Winner system, which selects the cheapest product among the same products as the sole seller. There is criticism that sellers offering items for as low as one won can monopolize the market. According to Coupang's terms and conditions, this right is delegated to Coupang as soon as the product's image and trademark are posted. In the process, problems can arise because sellers can use other sellers' images, via Coupang's copyright-transfer agreements. In May 2021, the situation was reported to be under review by the Fair Trade Commission.
