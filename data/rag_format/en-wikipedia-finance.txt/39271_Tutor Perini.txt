## History


### A.G. Tutor Company, Inc

In 1949, Albert G. Tutor launched a family construction business, A.G. Tutor Company, Inc. His son Ronald joined the company in 1963, and the company expanded under his leadership. In 1972 the company partnered with N.M. Saliba. In 1981 Ron Tutor took the reins as president of the Tutor-Saliba Corporation.


### Perini Corporation

Perini Corporation was founded in 1894 in Ashland, Massachusetts by a stonemason named Bonfiglio Perini. The company grew to become one of the region's most recognized heavy construction contractors. From 1931 to 2009, Perini was headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts.

Under the direction of Bonfiglio's grandson, Lou Perini, the company moved into the real-estate business, developing 4,500 acres (1,800 ha) in Palm Beach County, Florida. Later real-estate ventures were less successful, leaving Perini deeply in debt by the mid-1990s.


### Tutor Perini Corporation

In 1997, Ron Tutor helped Perini Corp. recapitalize alongside investor Richard Blum. Tutor became CEO of Perini in 2000 and merged Perini with Tutor-Saliba in 2008 in a transaction valued at $862 million.

Perini was listed on the NYSE on April 1, 2004. It was headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts until relocating to Sylmar, California in 2009.

In May 2009, Perini shareholders voted to change the company's name to Tutor Perini Corporation. Tutor Perini issued $300 million of Senior Notes in October 2010. Tutor Perini proceeded to acquire six companies over the next nine months.


## Acquisitions

In 2003, Perini acquired Florida-based James A. Cummings Inc. In 2005, the company acquired Cherry Hill Construction, a Maryland-based contractor, and California-based Rudolph & Sletten, Inc. In January 2009, the corporation acquired Philadelphia-based building contractor Keating Building Corporation.

The terminal has its own retail concessions, parking and ticketing. The new 1,900,000-square-foot terminal building includes a basement, three upper levels and roof-level penthouses. The building houses a baggage handling system for outbound and inbound processing, and an in-line explosives detection system for baggage screening. The building's infrastructure is designed with extensive cabling for software interfaces. Other features include dynamic and static signage, way finding systems and Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP). The elevated roadway extends the length of the terminal – approximately 90-foot wide and 2,000-foot long.

Work was performed within a tight footprint, and included a site topographic survey, subsurface and geotechnical investigation, a hydrogeological study for the water well design, demolition of existing buildings, site excavation, and grading. The project was awarded under a multiple award task order contract for design-build services within the Central Command Area of Operations. Perini successfully completed $850 million worth of design-build task orders under the base contract.


### Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, NV

As a mixed-use, urban high-rise development, on approximately 8.5 acres, the project includes over 6,000,000 square feet of development.

### Purple Line Extension Project, Sections 2 & 3 in Los Angeles, CA

Tutor Perini is building on two sections and four stations on the Purple Line Extension: Wilshire/Rodeo, Century City/Constellation, Westwood/UCLA, and Westwood/VA Hospital. Tutor Perini is also the Design-Build Contractor for the Purple Line Extension Section 3 Tunnels contract which will add 2.56 miles of new rail to the Purple Line. The Westwood/UCLA station will be located under Wilshire Boulevard between Veteran Avenue and Westwood Boulevard. The Westwood/VA Hospital station, including two crossovers, will be located to the west of the I‐405 Freeway and south of Wilshire Boulevard and will include a pedestrian bridge to the south of Wilshire. Both stations will be constructed of cast-in-place concrete in a subterranean environment in the middle of major urban shopping districts and commercial city streets. Tutor Perini will design not only the major support-of-excavation (SOE) down to a depth of up to 100 vertical feet below street level but also temporary traffic decking system to carry vehicular traffic over the stations box cavities during stations construction. From the current terminus at Wilshire/Western, the Purple Line Extension will extend westward for about 9 miles with seven new stations. It will provide a high-capacity, high-speed, dependable alternative for those traveling to and from LA's “second downtown.” Section 2 of the three sections will deliver 2.55 miles of twin-bored tunnels and two new stations at Wilshire/Rodeo and Century City Constellation. In January 2017, phase two of the project, which will extend trackage 2.6 miles (4.2 km) further to Century City, was awarded a $1.6 billion grant from the Federal Transit Administration, covering the majority of the $2.6 billion estimated cost of the project. On January 27, the Metro board awarded a $1.37 billion construction contract to a joint venture between Tutor Perini Corporation and O&G Industries, with construction scheduled to be completed by 2025.


### Airport Expansion - John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, NY

The finished product was a 12,700-foot long by 200-foot-wide new runway with 40-foot-wide shoulders that handles about 25 percent of the annual operations of the airport.

### SR 99 - Alaska Way Viaduct Replacement Tunnel in Seattle, WA

The SR 99 Alaskan Way Viaduct is being replaced with an approximately two-mile-long double-deck tunnel underneath downtown Seattle. Replacing the viaduct with a tunnel allows the highway to remain open for much of construction, thus minimizing closures and impacts to traffic. Once the tunnel opens, the viaduct will be taken down to clear the way for new public space along Seattle's downtown waterfront.
Seattle Tunnel Partners, is responsible for designing and building the SR 99 tunnel. In addition to boring the tunnel and building the highway within it, STP is responsible for building highway ramps and other connections at the north and south ends of the tunnel. They are also constructing buildings at each tunnel portal to house lighting, ventilation and other systems needed to operate the tunnel.

### BART San Francisco Airport Extension in San Francisco, CA

This design-build project expanded the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) system 8 miles into San Mateo County from the existing Colma City station to the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and terminating at the new Millbrae station. The project route required that the northern portion of the line be placed underground using a cut-and-cover approach. The southern half of the alignment ran parallel to the Caltrain Corridor, which remained in active service throughout construction for freight and passenger traffic. Service to the airport was created by raising the BART line onto an elevated section that crossed the Caltrain Corridor and a sensitive wetlands area then connected to a Caltrans crossing of the US Highway 101, where it ties into an elevated station at the airport that is integrated with the airport people mover system (also built by Tutor Perini Corporation for SFO).

## Allegations

Tutor Perini has gained a reputation for low balling government contracts only to later increase prices at the expense of the taxpayer:

Between 2000 and 2012 Tutor Perini has cost the state of California $765 million in additional unexpected costs on 11 different projects. This is mostly due to California law which requires the lowest bid to be selected.

In 2002, after an expansion at San Francisco International Airport went over budget by $360 million, City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued Tutor Perini for fraud and attempted to have it banned from bidding on city projects.

In March 2011, after a four-week trial a federal jury in Brooklyn found Zohrab B. Marashlian, the former president of Perini Corp.’s Civil Division, guilty of fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Tutor Perini had paid Marashlian $14 million during the investigation and trial. However, Marashlian committed suicide two days before he was to receive a prison sentence. A fellow employee is currently serving time in prison for the same case.

In April 2018, Tutor Perini had substituted weaker rails than those specified in the San Francisco construction contract, so the city ordered Tutor Perini to rip out much of the steel track it had already laid down. The San Francisco Examiner reported that this is likely to delay the opening of the subway and that Tutor Perini may file additional claims to recoup their costs.
