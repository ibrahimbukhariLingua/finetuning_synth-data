## History

Flippa was founded by Mark Harbottle and Matt Mickiewicz as the SitePoint Marketplace, and was spun off as a separate website in June 2009. By 2015, it had traded more than $140 million in websites, domains, and mobile apps.

The majority of Flippa's revenue comes from selling online businesses including content sites, SaaS businesses, ecommerce businesses, apps, digital services, marketplaces and more. The most expensive sale to date was a portfolio of Singapore-based apps, which sold for US$35,000,000. The most expensive domain name sold was planetrx.com, selling for US$1,200,000. Other notable websites and domains sold through Flippa have included Mark Zuckerberg's former website Facemash, overnight success story shipyourenemiesglitter.com, Retweet.com, and AllAboutCookies.org.

During the 2012 US presidential election, the domain name RomneyRyan.com was listed on Flippa. It reached US$8,050 in bids, but did not sell. It dropped in price the next year and was eventually sold through GoDaddy for US$235.00.
