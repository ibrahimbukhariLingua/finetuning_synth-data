For Common Cause


# For Common Cause



**For Common Cause** is a London-based charity that claims to combat inequality by crowdfunding skills, money, and equipment for people in need to build their own livelihoods. Volunteers and donors work with beneficiaries first-hand to see any personal impact.

For Common Cause identifies people on benefits who have completed training and prepared business plans through one of their partners. Potential entrepreneurs must have completed training and prepared business plans with one of For Common Cause's partners. People can browse projects or micro-enterprises to contact them directly to offer support. Supporters can help in a variety of ways: volunteering time or skills via email, phone, or at an event, or donating cash or equipment.


## History

For Common Cause was founded by Karen Snow after she worked with DFID and USAID on poverty reduction, civic participation, and public-private partnerships. Snow founded the charity after working with victims of trauma and torture in apartheid South Africa to launch their own livelihoods. "I saw there was nothing for those at the grassroots to do things for themselves. We have big institutions and governments, but they only offer a partial solution," said Snow in an interview with Calahane in 2013.


## Structure and management

The charity is managed by its governing document, a deed of trust, and constitutes a limited company, limited by guarantee by the Companies Act 2006.

For Common Cause as of 2015 has 260 volunteers who support the beneficiaries to get their business off the ground, and 150 registered beneficiaries.

Funds come from individuals, a 5% fee on all donations made through the site, Gift Aid from donations, corporate sponsorship and trust and foundation grants. Unrestricted funding goes towards the running costs of the organization; individual donations made towards projects go directly to beneficiaries. Included in the 5% fee are fees associated with credit card processing, foreign currency exchange, transaction costs, and Gift Aid processing costs.

For Common Cause had an income of £91,062 and spent £58,172 in 2013.
