# Magento



**Magento** is an open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP. Magento source code is distributed under Open Software License. Magento was acquired by Adobe Inc in May 2018 for $1.68 billion.

More than 150,000 online stores have been created on the platform. The platform code has been downloaded more than 2.5 million times, and $155 billion worth of goods were sold through Magento-based systems in 2019. As of April 2021, Magento holds a 2.32% market share in global e-commerce platforms.

Roy Rubin, the former CEO of Varien, sold a share of the company to eBay, which eventually completely acquired and then sold the company to Permira; Permira later sold it to Adobe.


## History

Magento is officially started development in early 2007. The software was originally developed by **Varien Inc.**, a US private company headquartered in Culver City, California, with assistance from volunteers and open-source software contributors. Seven months later, on August 31, 2007, the first public beta version was released.

Varien, the company owning Magento, formerly worked with osCommerce. Varien had originally planned to fork osCommerce but later decided to rewrite it as Magento. Varien published the first general-availability release of the software on March 31, 2008.

In the first years of its existence, the platform has been the winner of the "*Best of Open Source Software Awards"* and *"SourceForge Community Choice Awards"* several times.

In February 2011, eBay announced it had made an investment in Magento in 2010, worth a 49% ownership share of the company.
On June 6, 2011, eBay announced that it would be acquiring the rest of Magento, which would join its new X.Commerce initiative. Magento's CEO and co-founder Roy Rubin wrote on the Magento blog that "Magento will continue to operate out of Los Angeles, with Yoav Kutner and me as its leaders.".

Yoav Kutner left Magento in April 2012, citing that the vision for Magento had changed since the time of acquisition due to high-level staff changes.

As a result of the breakup of eBay following Carl Icahn's raid, Magento was spun out as an independent company and sold to Permira, a private equity fund, on 3 November 2015.

In May 2018, it was announced that Magento would be acquired by Adobe for $1.68bn to integrate it into Adobe Experience Cloud, its Enterprise CMS platform. The acquisition was finalized on June 19, 2018.


## Overview

Magento employs the MySQL or MariaDB relational database management system, the PHP programming language, and elements of the Zend Framework. It uses multiple other PHP frameworks such as Laminas (formerly known as Zend Framework) and Symfony. It applies the conventions of object-oriented programming and model–view–controller architecture. Magento also uses the entity–attribute–value model to store data and as of version 2.4 it requires Elasticsearch for its catalog search capability. On top of that, Magento 2 introduced the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to its front-end code using the JavaScript library Knockout.js.


### Magento Open Source

Magento Open Source, previously Magento Community Edition, is an open-source e-commerce platform. Developers can implement the core files and extend their functionality by adding new plug-in modules provided by other developers.

As of 2017, both the latest release and each of the historical releases of the version 1.x and 2.x branches of Magento Open Source were available on the Magento Commerce, Inc. website for download. Development of the version 2 branch of Magento Open Source is coordinated publicly on GitHub.

Adobe announced after its acquisition that Magento would remain open source. Magento 1.9.4, the last version of the Magento 1.x branch, reached end-of-life on June 30, 2020.


#### Magento 2

Magento 2 was announced in 2010. It was planned for release in 2011, and a beta version for merchants was released in July 2015. Magento 2 differs in architecture from the previous version, with improved features and developer tools. Magento 1 and Magento 2 existed simultaneously for some years.

On November 17, 2015, Magento 2 was released. Among the features changed in V2 were:

* significant performance and security improvements, especially when paired with PHP version 7+
* integrated server-side Apache Varnish caching with minimal tuning
* reduced database table-locking issues
* enterprise-grade database scalability
* Rich snippets for structured data
* new file structure with easier customization
* CSS preprocessing using LESS & CSS URL resolver
* modular code base structure, offering fine-grain customization
* improved coding patterns
* built-in client-side JavaScript minimization and optimization
* improved static content browser caching

#### OpenMage

OpenMage is a fork of Magento 1.x (version 1.9.4.5) maintained by the community on GitHub to offer long-term support and continued bug fixes for Magento 1.x installations.


### Adobe Commerce

Adobe Commerce is an e-commerce platform as a service released on April 11, 2016. It initially launched as Magento Commerce. In April 2021, Magento Commerce was rebranded to Adobe Commerce, as part of a long-term project to integrate Magento within the Adobe Experience Cloud business unit.

Adobe Commerce is available in an on-premises version and as a service hosted by Adobe in the cloud. The hosted version launched as Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition and later became Adobe Commerce Managed Services.

**Adobe Commerce On-Premise** is derived from Magento Open Source and designed for large businesses. It shares the same core files as Magento Open Source but is not freely licensed and has additional proprietary features and functionality. It was originally called Magento Enterprise Edition, and later Magento Commerce (On-Premises), before rebranding to Adobe Commerce On-Premise. The latest actively supported version of Magento Commerce is 2.3.4 (EE and CE) released on October 8, 2019.

There were also two former platforms, Magento Professional Edition, and Magento Go.

## Security concerns

In 2015, it was reported that outdated or unpatched Magento web stores were susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack, which allowed attackers to perform online skimming to steal user credit card information. According to a security expert, more than 4000 Magento web stores were vulnerable to such an attack in October 2016.

In 2017, security company DefenseCode reported that Magento CE web stores were susceptible to a remote code execution attack, which allowed attackers to perform web skimming, steal stored credit card information of future and previous customers, take control of the database, and in some instances even the complete server - including other Magento instances. It's suspected that up to 260,000 Magento web stores could be vulnerable to such an attack in April 2017.

In 2019, Magento reported a potential vulnerability in its administration URL location for its 2.1.x, 2.2.x, and 2.3.x versions. It also reported a critical security breach for customers running version 1.0.2 (and earlier versions) of the Magestore Store Locator extension. Similar incidences of a Magecart attack and Magento killer have also been faced by e-commerce store owners.


## Events

"Imagine eCommerce" is the annual Magento eCommerce conference that has run since 2011. The first event was held in February 2011 in Los Angeles with more than 600 Magento merchants, partners, and developers. The goals of the event are sharing e-commerce ideas and providing networking opportunity sessions.

Besides Imagine, Magento also organizes local "Magento Live" events in which the participants will have opportunities to learn more about e-commerce in general, get introduced to local Magento partners, and learn about upcoming changes to the Magento software itself. Magento Live events have been held in Australia (Sydney), UK (London), The Netherlands (Amsterdam), Spain (Barcelona), France (Paris) and Germany (München).

There is a non-profit organization that was established in 2019 and that contributes up to more than 24 global "Meet Magento" events per year named "Magento Association" The association is open to all companies who are active in e-commerce in any way and want using Magento commerce now or in future. The project has been run on all developed markets of Magento like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, India and also Vietnam.


## Certification

There are four different Magento certifications: three of them aim to prove developers' competency in implementing modules; one (Certified Solution Specialist) targets business users (consultants, analysts, project managers). Magento Front End Developer Certification is mainly focused on improving the user interface (UI) of back-end developers who implement the core modules. The Plus certification tests a deep understanding of Magento Enterprise modules and the entire architecture.


## Resources

The docker-magento project allows Magento development environments to be easily set up. It works for both new and existing Magento instances, and has been maintained and supported by M.academy since September 20, 2015.

Magento Open Source 2.0.0 was released on November 17, 2015, and the latest version 2.4.7-p3 was released on October 8, 2025.

Magento 1 migration to Magento 2 can be done by the official Data Migration Tool. The migration can be performed by developers with extensive Magento 1 and 2 experience.

Official Adobe Commerce release notes are available.


## Criticism and controversy

In 2011, a *TechCrunch* article reported that according to its sources, former Magento employees claim they have been collectively "cheated out" of nearly 7-10% of Magento, a stake that would have been worth approximately $18 million when eBay acquired the company earlier that year.
