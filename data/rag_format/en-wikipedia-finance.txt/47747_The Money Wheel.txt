The Money Wheel


# The Money Wheel



***The Money Wheel*** is a business news television program aired on weekdays on the CNBC network from its inception in 1989 until 1998. Initially, *The Money Wheel* covered almost all of the channel's business day hours, airing continuously from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET each day. The show's hours were later cut back to 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 2 to 3 p.m. ET as other programs were introduced to the schedule. The show gave viewers the latest market action on Wall Street as the trading day progressed.

*The Money Wheel* was hosted by many anchors of CNBC, including Ted David, Felicia Taylor, Bill Griffeth, Sue Herera, Ron Insana, Terry Keenan, John Stehr and Kevin McCullough.

Regular segments included *Taking Stock* where viewers could phone-in and ask the guest analysts' recommendations on certain stocks.

As a result of CNBC's alliance with Dow Jones, the show was renamed *Market Watch* in the morning and was replaced by an extended *Street Signs* in the afternoon. At the time, most segments remained the same.


## International Editions

CNBC's two main international channels, CNBC Europe and CNBC Asia, aired regional versions of the programme to give viewers live coverage of regional markets.
