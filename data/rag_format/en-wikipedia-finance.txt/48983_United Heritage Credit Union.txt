## History

United Heritage Credit Union was founded in 1957 as Military Federal Credit Union offering loans and savings to military personnel. In 1969, the credit union expanded as Bergstrom Federal Credit Union, at which time it was able to add more services and increase its membership base. In 1989, the credit union merged with Texas Hospital Association Credit Union, Texas National Guard Credit Union and Healthcare Federal Credit Union. Therefore, by 1993, the credit union was able to include hospitals, hospital affiliates and select employer groups (SEGs) to its growing membership base. In that same year the credit union changed its name to United Heritage Federal Credit Union. Then in 1997, the credit union switched from a federal charter to a state charter, officially changing the name to United Heritage Credit Union.

United Heritage has repeatedly been named as one of Austin’s Top 5 Credit Unions by the *Austin Business Journal* 2019.

United Heritage competed in the Financial Services category and received the Best Financial Services Site title. The overall title of Site of the Year 2013 was awarded to the Canadian Red Cross website.

In 2015, United Heritage Credit Union made The Financial Brand's list of "Top 100 Credit Unions Using Social Media." That same year, the credit union nabbed a spot on The Financial Brand's list of "25 Inspirational & Responsive Banking Website Designs."
