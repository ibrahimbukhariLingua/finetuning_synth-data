## History

CBD was founded in 1969, by an Amiri Decree issued by the late Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum. What started out as a joint venture of Commerzbank, Chase Manhattan Bank and Commercial Bank of Kuwait, evolved into a National Public shareholding company by 1982. 80% of its shares are held by UAE nationals, while the other 20% are owned by Investment Corporation of Dubai (an investment division of the Dubai Government).

CBD provides Wholesale, Corporate, Retail, Business, SME, Private and Affluent banking services.

In 2018, CBD introduced a digital-first approach, focusing on technology to enhance customer interactions. The bank is adjusting its branch model to prioritize sales, service, and support, while also maintaining digital and mobile channels. CEO Dr. Bernd van Linder is overseeing these changes.

In 2022, CBD partnered with fintech company Postpay to provide transaction banking, debt funding, and e-commerce solutions.

In 2024, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Du from Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC) announced their collaboration with CBD.
