Upon graduation, he became an analyst and portfolio manager for Argenta Zrt., where he was in charge of managing long-term investments in foreign capital markets. 2008–2010 he was CEO of Morrow Ltd. providing services related to foreign currency exchange risk in the real economy. Between 2010 and 2014, he was Chief Foreign Currency Strategist of OTP Bank providing regional-level investment advice and overseeing regional analytics. He left the bank to start his political career.


## Politics

He had arrived to Together from the One Million for the Freedom of Press Movement (Milla) in February 2014 to become the Chief Economist of the party. He held the 6th place on the national list of the party on the 2014 parliamentary elections. He was elected a board member of the party in July and Chair of the Board of the Together for Hungary Foundation. The Foundation was later renamed in remembrance to András Váradi Foundation, following the death of András Váradi, the party's member and mayor candidate in Alcsútdoboz. After unsuccessfully running as candidate for the party leadership against Viktor Szigetvári, he was elected a vice president of the party in February 2015.

Pápa left the party in September 2016. He argued the Together had gradually lost its independent character in comparison to the "old left-wing parties" (Hungarian Socialist Party and Democratic Coalition), and the Together also became part of Orbán's regime.
