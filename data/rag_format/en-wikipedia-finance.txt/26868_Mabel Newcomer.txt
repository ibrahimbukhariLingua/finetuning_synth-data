### Bretton Woods Conference

Mabel Newcomer was one of the American delegates to attend the Bretton Woods Conference. While at the conference, she was a member of the first Committee of the first Commission, and first Committee of the second Commission. Those Committees were responsible for deciding upon the Purposes, Policies, and Quotas of the International Monetary Fund; and the World Bank.

She was one of two women that were present at the conference, with the other being Mrs. L.J. Gouseva from the USSR. The decision to include Newcomer as a member of the American delegation is a debated issue, as there is disagreement on why she was chosen. There are some sources which say that Eleanor Roosevelt had required there to be at least one female in the American delegation, and that she was especially chosen as she was one of the Roosevelt's neighbors and had taught Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr's daughter. To further support this claim are the reports that while at the Bretton Woods Conference, Newcomer spent more time going rock-climbing than in the meetings. Despite this, documents from the time also show how she was recommended by the Committee on Participation of Women in Post-War Planning with two other women as candidates for representatives of the United States at the Bretton Woods Conference, which was given to Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Furthermore, Newcomer was one of two non-governmental delegates at the conference, and of those she was the only to be in the field of academics. Despite this, the American delegation was selected so it would be easiest to convince the Presidential administration, Congress, and businessmen and scholars of the necessity of the Bretton Woods Agreements. As such, Newcomer was expected to promote the Bretton Woods Conference to her fellow women and academics.

There is not much written on Newcomer's involvement on the decision-making at the Bretton Woods Conference, except on the decision concerning the Fund Quota and Bank Subscription for the Soviet Union. In that, she believed that it was better for the United States to pay additional money for the Bank Subscription of the Soviet Union so that they did not leave the conference or weaken the agreements made at the conference. In addition to her impacts during the conference, Newcomer was also a proponent of the agreements created after the conference's passing. She made a number of speeches and writings in favor of the Bretton Woods Conference.
