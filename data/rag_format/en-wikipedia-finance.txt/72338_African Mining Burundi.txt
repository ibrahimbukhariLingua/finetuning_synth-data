African Mining Burundi


# African Mining Burundi



**African Mining Burundi**, was a public-private partnership that mined gold and other minerals in Burundi.


## Background

The Muhwazi perimeter ln the Commune of Butihinda, Muyinga Province, was explored by Flemish Investments Limited and Burundi Mining Company (BUMINCO). Both companies withdrew, and after 9 months of research, BUMINCO applied for an exploitation permit on the Masaka perimeter.
On 21 August 2017, the British company African Mining Limited obtained an exploration permit for gold and associated minerals on the Muhwazi perimeter.


## History

On 8 August 2018 African Mining Burundi was established as an 85% subsidiary of African Mining Limited, with the state holding 15%.
The new company was licensed to exploit the gold deposit in Masaka and in nine other identified mining sites.

On 8 October 2018 Pierre Nkurunziza, President of Burundi, attended the official launch of industrial mining activities by African Mining Burundi on the Masaka I site.
Presidential decree no 100/191 of 18 December 2019 named Simon Ngendakumana as administrator representing the state on the board of directors of African Mining Limited.

The gold processing plant was built in the Masaka *colline* of Butihinda Commune.
