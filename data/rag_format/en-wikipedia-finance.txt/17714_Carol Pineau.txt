*Africa: Open for Business* was Pineau’s first documentary film which she wrote, directed, and produced. It was one of the six BBC Documentaries of the Year in 2006, and won a CINE Golden Eagle Award. Highlighting ten stories of local African entrepreneurial businesses, *Africa* shows the true stories of pioneering companies in challenging economies.
Countries portrayed in the film include Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Botswana, Uganda, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and more. In detailing the successes found in these nations, Pineau divests her viewer from the common misconceptions and myths of the Africa seen in the vast media today. Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, said to Pineau of the film, "Your analysis of the situation in Africa was very perceptive, and much more balanced than one usually finds in articles about the continent."ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
