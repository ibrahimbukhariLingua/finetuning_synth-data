The core purpose was to encourage the study of theory and practice of banking and all allied subjects. It was established under the Pakistani Companies Ordinance 1984 with a paid up capital of Rs. 250.0 million. The equity was contributed by the nationalized commercial banks and PBC that held 3% of the shares in its name. Consequent upon dissolution of PBC in 1997 State Bank of Pakistan took over the assets and liabilities of PBC and purchased assets of NIBAF. In February 1997, the Training Department of the State Bank was shifted to NIBAF premises at Islamabad.
