Under the deal, Macquarie Media Group would then onsell the metropolitan radio stations to Fairfax Media. On 5 November 2007, the company officially acquired Southern Cross Broadcasting's assets. On 17 December 2009 shareholders approved a restructuring plan. The company was then renamed from Macquarie Media Group to its current name on 17 December 2009.
