At age 25, Dikshit was asked by Parasol to write the betting software for her company Starluck Casino. He joined in 1998, one year after it was founded by Parasol, and wrote the software that "allowed gamblers in different parts of the world to pay poker with one another." Starluck Casino was launched as PartyPoker in 2001 after Dikshit and Parasol switched their focus from roulette and blackjack to poker. Since online gambling was illegal in the US at the time, the company's servers and offices were based in Gibraltar, where Dikshit settled.

The company floated on the London Stock Exchange in June 2005, with Dikshit earning a significant sum due to owning a considerable portion of the company.

"I came to believe there was a high probability it was in violation of U.S. laws", Dikshit told U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in New York, referring to PartyGaming's activity. At the time, he still owned approximately 28% of the company's shares, equal at the time to about $300 million. He paid off the fine in June 2009.
