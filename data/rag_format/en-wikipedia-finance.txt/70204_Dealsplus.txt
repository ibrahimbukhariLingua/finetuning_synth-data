## Overview

DealsPlus sources deal and coupon content from its community of users as well as from a group of power users called Money Makers.

## History

DealsPlus was founded in 2006 as a social deal and coupon site. DealsPlus attempted to acquire the domain dealsplus.com in 2010 through a UDRP action but a three-judge panel rejected the UDRP claim. In early 2013, DealsPlus acquired Dealsplus.com for an unknown sum and changed some of its branding and design to reflect ownership of the new URL.
