# Gilbert + Tobin



**Gilbert + Tobin** is a leading Australian law firm with offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. It provides legal services to corporate and government clients across Australia and internationally.

Established in 1988 by Danny Gilbert and Tony Tobin, the firm employs approximately 1000 people, and has one of the highest proportions of female partners of any major Australian law firm.

Gilbert + Tobin depart from the usual practice at similar law firms in their use of a flat hierarchy, with no formal band structures. This means that all of its legally trained employees are referred to as "lawyers", rather than associates or senior associates.ᵗʰⁱʳᵈ-ᵖᵃʳᵗʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Staff conditions

Over 2018 and 2019, the New South Wales workplace regulator, SafeWork NSW, investigated Gilbert + Tobin on two separate occasions, following complaints of workplace fatigue and excessive work hours. The first inquiry was in response to allegations from a senior lawyer that the firm's junior lawyers regularly slept in offices and needed stimulant supplements to keep abreast of work demands. The firm had its HR department launch an internal investigation. Managing partner Danny Gilbert characterised the complaint as "vicious" and as containing "untruths". Gilbert said he was aware of the onerous demands placed on staff, but the nature of the business environment meant high workloads were unavoidable. He emphasised in an email to staff that, nevertheless, workloads should not compromise health and safety, and the firm was always ready to do better and find ways to relieve staff pressure.

After SafeWork met with management in January 2019, the regulator indicated it was satisfied, saying Gilbert + Tobin "had the organisational capacity and responsiveness to assess and address risks and issues as they arise", and declined to take further action. A separate complaint arose in November 2019 with SafeWork undertaking a workplace inspection at G+T’s Sydney offices, where they interviewed fourteen staff members. SafeWork were to provide a full report on the firms's workplace policies following their inquiry.

Some partners of other law firms were reportedly critical of what, in their view, appeared to be the minimisation and justification of adverse work conditions for, especially, young lawyers. There have been reports of similarly excessive hours and high pressure for staff across leading law firms in Australia, and at least one other case of regulator intervention.
