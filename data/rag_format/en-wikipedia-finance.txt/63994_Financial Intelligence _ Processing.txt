# Financial Intelligence & Processing



**Financial Intelligence & Processing (FIP)** is an international firm based in Paris offering financial and business intelligence.

In 2011 and 2012, FIP was listed among the top experts of financial fraud investigation in France, just after KPMG, as assessed by Décideurs Stratégie Finance Droit in the "Risk Management, Insurance and Litigation" yearly guide.


## Structure

FIP was formed in 2005 by combining the skills of experts in the areas of financial engineering, fraud examination and investigation. FIP relies on the skills and experiences of its consultant teams spread across its three European locations (Brussels, Paris and Geneva). It has built an international network of correspondents leading them to work in jurisdictions such as China, DR Congo, Dubai, the USA, Guinea, Iraq, Morocco, Russia, Turkey or Vietnam.

Among others, their experience led them to work for the heiress of the Agnelli empire and to look for the "secretive treasures" of her father, Gianni Agnelli.

FLS was cited in the "affaire AEF-Ockrent"


## Direction

Called the "James Bond of financial circuits", Marc Hürner founded FIP to provide clients with his experience (in Ernst & Young, KPMG among others) and investigative skills in all matters related to the prevention and detection of fraud, tax evasion schemes and counterfeit, and the reinforcement of internal controls.

Hervé Zany, director of the French FIP office, is a recognized expert in anti-fraud. He worked for KPMG and directed the Kroll office of Paris.
