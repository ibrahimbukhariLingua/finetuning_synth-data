## History

TruAmerica was formed in 2013 by a partnership between Hart and The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America. Hart founded the company after leaving Kennedy Wilson, a global real estate company where he served for 13 years as president and CEO of its multifamily management group. Since its founding, TruAmerica has largely focused on investing in and renovating older mid-level or “Class B” garden style and midrise apartment communities to attract a segment of the population that rents out of necessity. These properties are located in first or second ring submarkets outside major metros areas and employment hubs.

In 2015, TruAmerica partnered with Guardian and Allstate to purchase a 14 property apartment portfolio in Southern California for $482 million. While mid-level apartments remain its main focus, TruAmerica has also made investments in luxury properties. In 2014, TruAmerica in partnership with Capri Capital Partners acquired The Vermont, a luxury apartment community in Los Angeles' Koreatown for $283 million. In 2016, it purchased Millennium Woodland Hills, a luxury apartment community in Los Angeles, for $163 million.

At the end of 2017, 15 percent of the company's portfolio was located in Maryland and Florida and it signaled plans to make major investments in other mid-Atlantic and southern states. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust became the 16th institutional capital partner to joint venture with TruAmerica when they acquired a 635-unit portfolio of assets in Denver and Seattle in January 2018. TruAmerica ended 2018 with $1.3 billion in transaction activity.
