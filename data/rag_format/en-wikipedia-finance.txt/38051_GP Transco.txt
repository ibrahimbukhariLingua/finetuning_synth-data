**GP Transco** is an American trucking company known for providing transportation and logistics services in the United States and Canada.


## History

GP Transco was founded on June 30, 2006, by Gedas Poviliunas, in Illinois. The company was headquartered in Darien before moving to its new headquarters in Joliet, Illinois, in 2020.

In 2019, the company launched a program to reward its top fifty percent of drivers with a salary bonus each month based on fuel efficiency.

In 2020, GP Transco partnered with Samsara Telematics Solutions to deploy their IoT platform that included dashboard cameras and AI to monitor drivers and streamline operations. In the same year, the company built its cloud-based transportation management system platform, OpenRoad TMS. The system is reported to have improved operational efficiencies, contributing to a 480% return on investment. OpenRoad TMS automates the provision of truck location updates, which reduces the need for manual communication between drivers, brokers, and customers. In 2023, GP Transco made their proprietary Transportation Management System, OpenRoad TMS, public.

GP Transco has integrated solar technology into its fleet to enhance sustainability and reduce costs. According to Freight Waves, starting in 2024, initially trialing solar panels on ten trucks, the company is expanding this to its full fleet of about 600 trucks. These panels, affixed to truck roofs, power cab electrical systems, reduce idling needs, cut carbon emissions and extend battery life.

In January 2024, GP Transco introduced an optional per diem pay program that allows drivers to claim $69 per night away from home as non-taxable, aimed at improving retention and addressing rising living costs.

GP Transco's internal podcast, "Voice GP Transco," communicates company updates and policies to employees, increasing participation in a fuel incentive program from 30% to nearly 90%. Hosted monthly on a private YouTube channel, it reaches about 90% of the company's drivers.
