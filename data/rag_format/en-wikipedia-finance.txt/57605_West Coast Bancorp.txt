## History

The company was first organized in 1925 in Newport, Oregon, under the name of Bank of Newport. In 1995, Bank of Newport merged with Commercial Bank of Salem, Oregon. In 1999, after acquisitions of the Bank of Vancouver (of Vancouver, Washington), and Centennial Bank of Olympia, Washington, the new entity changed its name to West Coast Bank.

In October 2009, the company raised $155 million in additional capital, but also received a warning about its lending practices from federal and state regulators. Columbia Bank System of Tacoma, Washington, and West Coast announced on September 26, 2012, that Columbia would purchase West Coast in a cash-and-stock deal worth $506 million. It had traded on the NASDAQ as WCBO.
