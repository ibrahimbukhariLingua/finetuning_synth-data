UCL Department of Economics


# UCL Department of Economics



The **UCL Department of Economics** is one of nine Departments and Institutes within the Faculty of Social and Historical Sciences at University College London. It is the oldest department of economics in England and is research-intensive, currently headed by Professor Fabien Postel-Vinay.


## History

In 1824, Jean-Baptiste Say expressed his enthusiasm for the creation of a Chair of Political Economy in London in a letter to Jeremy Bentham, reading: *“Joseph Hume tells me that you are going to establish a Chair of Political Economy in London. Bravo! Teach where the true national interests lie, and those who set personal interests against them will not have it easy". Bentham* was a significant influence on the creation of UCL, often described as its ‘spiritual father’, and Hume was a member of the college’s original council.

The Chair of Political Economy at UCL was created in 1828 in memory of David Ricardo, establishing the first Department of Economics in England. The first holder of the Chair was John Ramsay McCulloch. William Stanley Jevons held a professorship of economics at UCL between 1876 and 1880.


## Research

In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF2014), the Department received an overall grade-point average of 3.78 (out of 4) - the highest of any department in Economics and Econometrics, or any field, in the UK.
