## History

Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon PLC was launched in July 1985, in order to capitalise on the investment opportunity available among companies too small and illiquid for Baillie Gifford Japan Trust PLC, which had been launched successfully four years before. Shin Nippon, which means New Japan, has as its objective the pursuit of long term capital growth principally through investment in small Japanese companies which are believed to have above average prospects for capital growth. It became part of the FTSE 250 Index in November 2020.
