LSE Alternative Investment Conference


# LSE Alternative Investment Conference



The **LSE SU Alternative Investments Conference** (also known as the **LSE AIC**) is an international financial conference that focuses on hedge funds, private equity and venture capital held annually in London by the Alternative Investments Society (AIC), a Student’s Union society at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).


## History

The Alternative Investments Society was founded in 2006 by a group of undergraduate students at the London School of Economics, and continues to be run by students from the university. The first Alternative Investments Conference was a one-day event hosted on the LSE campus in 2007, and was attended by 200 students who heard from several notable investors.

The AIC has evolved considerably over its history, having changed venues and ultimately becoming the world’s largest student conference on hedge funds, private equity and venture capital. By 2024, it was help at the Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square with 350 delegates and almost 60 industry leaders over 2 days.


## Overview


### Format

The Conference takes place over two days at the five-star London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square, bringing together over 40 senior level industry leaders (see notable past speakers) and 320 student delegates from many of the world’s leading educational institutions. Delegates come from a range of backgrounds, including both undergraduates and postgraduates studying finance, law, engineering, history as well as many other disciplines. Admission to the Conference is competitive, with only 4.3% of applicants to AIC 2017 being selected to attend.
