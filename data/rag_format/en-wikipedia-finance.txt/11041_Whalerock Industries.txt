## History

Whalerock Industries was founded in January 2014 by Lloyd Braun, previously the president of Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, the chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group, and the head of the Yahoo! Media Group. In 2005, he predicted that celebrities would become "more directly in contact with their fans, and that "instead of watching them through a cable box, you could see them on the Web and interact with them more." *The Street* wrote in 2015 that Braun was doing "exactly" that, "but using mobile and over-the-top distribution over the Internet without traditional networks, cable TV, or even major social networking sites."

Braun founded Whalerock Industries following his buyout of BermanBraun, a media production company he co-founded with Gail Berman. In 2015, the investment firm GF Capital acquired a minority stake in the company, MGM renewed its existing TV and film deal with Whalerock, and launched the direct-to-consumer over-the-top media hubs were launched. In 2016, the investment company Insight Venture Partners acquired a minority stake in the company.

In September 2018, RockYou acquired Mom.me and Purple Clover from Whalerock Industries for an undisclosed amount.
