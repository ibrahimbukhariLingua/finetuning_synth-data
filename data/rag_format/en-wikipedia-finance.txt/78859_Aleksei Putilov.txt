## Revolution and exile

Following the abdication of Nicholas II in 1917, Putilov and V.I. Vyshnegradsky organized the Society for the Economic Revival of Russia. Putilov actively supported General Lavr Kornilov, whose coup attempt in September 1917 (N.S.) was a failure.

Putilov was a member of the Provisional Council of the Russian Republic, which convened in Petrograd on 7 (20) October 1917. Following the Bolshevik coup of 25 October (7 November) 1917, the Provisional Council was dissolved, All assets of the Russo-Asiatic Bank within Russia were nationalized by the Bolshevik government. Putilov left for Harbin, in Manchuria, which was the center of the economic base of the Russo-Asiatic Bank. His elder son Sergei had previously left for Paris, while the remainder of the family remained at their home in Petrograd at 11 Mytninskaya Embankment.

In his absence, all of Putilov's properties, movable and unmovable, were confiscated by decree of the Council of People's Commissars on 30 December 1917 (12 January 1918). In the spring of 1918 Putilov's wife Vera, daughter Ekaterina, granddaughter, and younger son Ivan were able to escape to Finland and thence to Paris. In the meantime, in Harbin Putilov collaborated with *Leytenant-General* (Lieutenant-General) Dmitry Khorvat, the head of the Chinese Eastern Railway, in maintaining "White" Russian control of the railway and providing financial assistance to the anti-Bolshevik "Armed Forces in the South of Russia," led by General Pyotr Wrangel.

Putilov then joined his family in Paris, where he restored the activities of the Russo-Asiatic Bank on the basis of its foreign branches, with its main office in Paris. In 1921 he negotiated with Leonid Krasin about the possibility of creating a Soviet-French issuing bank to help the Soviet government carry out monetary reforms. Nothing came of the discussions, but when they were publicized and misrepresented by the emigre press in 1926, Putilov was forced to resign as chairman of the Russo-Asiatic Bank. He was succeeded by *Knyaz* (Prince) Sergei Kudashev. The bank failed on 26 September 1926 after losing some five million pounds in speculation in the Paris financial market, and was finally liquidated in 1928.

Putilov died in Paris on 2 June 1940.
