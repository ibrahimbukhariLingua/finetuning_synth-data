Hough Graduate School of Business


# Hough Graduate School of Business



The **Hough Graduate School of Business** is the home to the graduate business programs of the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida. All programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.


## William R. Hough

The school is named after William R. Hough of St. Petersburg, Fla. He was the founder of the investment firm bearing his name and is an alumnus of the College's first MBA class in 1948. Hough donated $30 million to the College in 2007, which was the largest private gift ever received by the University of Florida at that time.

The funds established an endowment to support teaching, academic programs and enhancements in the Hough Graduate School of Business and provided a lead gift to construct a new building to house the graduate business programs named after Mr. Hough himself. The gift is also eligible for matching funds from the State of Florida Major Gifts Trust Fund and from the Alec P. Courtelis Facilities Enhancement Challenge Grant Program, potentially increasing the total value of the gift to $50 million.
