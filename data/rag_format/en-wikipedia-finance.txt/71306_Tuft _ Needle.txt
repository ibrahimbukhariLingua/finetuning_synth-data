**Tuft & Needle** is an American bed-in-a-box company that launched in 2012. On September 28, 2018, the company was acquired by Serta Simmons Bedding.


## History

Tuft & Needle started as an e-commerce company founded on July 19, 2012 by Daehee Park and John-Thomas Marino. They Both met via the entrepreneur program at Pennsylvania State University.

The company generated $1 million in sales at the end of 2013. The company later opened its first brick and mortar showroom in the company's Phoenix headquarters in December 2014.

Tuft & Needle acquired 'TN.com' domain in September 2015. The company established its headquarters at O.S. Stapley Hardware buildings on Grand Avenue in Phoenix in December of 2015, after a city grant of $300,000 was used to improve and repair the buildings by a real estate developer. In 2015, Tuft & Needle grew to over 100 employees and earned over $100 million in revenue.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2017, the company had $170 million in sales. Tuft & Needle spent over $14 million in media during the same year.

On September 28, 2018, Tuft and Needle closed a merger with mattresses manufacturer Serta Simmons Bedding. In November 2018, they also announced a partnership with Amazon to release an Amazon-exclusive mattress called "The Nod." by Tuft & Needle.
