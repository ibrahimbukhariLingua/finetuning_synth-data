## History

Founded in 2010 in Tel Aviv, ironSource provides platforms and tools for application developers including analytics, user monetization, conversion, acquisition and optimization for all devices.

In the first quarter of 2013, ironSource acquired Israeli advertising technology and network company AfterDownload Ltd. for $28 million to expand its integrated distribution, installation and value-building tools for software developers, publishers and advertisers.

In Fall 2014, ironSource raised approximately $85 million from a group of international investors and acquired the mobile game studio Upopa. At this time, IronSource was considered a key company in Israel's 'Download Valley'.

In September 2015, ironSource merged Supersonic into its mobile operation for a price estimated to be $200 million. The new organization rebranded itself as ironSource.

In June 2016, ironSource announced the acquisition of Sequoia-backed video technology company StreamRail.

The deal was met with criticism from game developers due to ironSource's affiliation with malware. Unity completed the buyout in November 2022.


### InstallCore

In February 2011, the company released its first product, InstallCore, as an open-source SDK for a cross-platform installer creation tool and advertisement-delivery platform. InstallCore was observed to use stealth techniques to avoid observation by anti-virus and other security software, and to bypass validation checks by signing programs with illegitimate security certificates. This was classified as a Potentially Unwanted Application by Sophos in 2014 and by Microsoft Essential in 2015, with Malwarebytes identifying the program as "a family of bundlers that installs more than one application on the user's computer". The product was discontinued in 2020 and is no longer supported by the company.
