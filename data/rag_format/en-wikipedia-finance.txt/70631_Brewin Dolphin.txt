## History

The business can trace its origins back to the establishment of the stockbroking firm of John Dawes, a founder of the London Stock Exchange, in 1762. His firm evolved through many partner changes to become Wontner, Dolphin & Francis in 1970. In 1974 Brewin & Co merged with Wontner, Dolphin & Francis to form Brewin Dolphin. The business was incorporated in 1987 and acquired by Scandinavian Bank the same year. It was then the subject of a management buy-out from Scandinavian Bank in 1992 and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1994.

It acquired Bell Lawrie, a Scottish firm of investment managers, in 1993. It went on to buy Wise Speke, an investment manager operating in the North of England, in 1998 and Popes, a firm based in Stoke-on-Trent, in 2002. It then acquired Duncan Lawrie Asset Management, a firm operating in London, in December 2016 and Investec Wealth Management, a firm operating in Ireland, in October 2019. Other acquisitions include IFA firms Aylwin (2018), Epoch Wealth Management (2019), and actuarial consultancy Mathieson Consulting (2019).

In March 2022, RBC made a recommended offer for the company worth Â£1.6 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The necessary approvals were secured in September 2022.
