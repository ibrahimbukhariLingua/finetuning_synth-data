In 2011, the Russian Standard Bank chose the company's *Welcome XLS* solution to support management of rewards programs across all of their issued credit cards. This year also saw the company acquire the Singaporean company Axiomatic, and branch out into loyalty program consulting.

In 2012, the company released a point-of-sale solution called "The Loyalty Impact: At Store", which it marketed to banks who then re-sold the service to retailers. The service provided a discount coupon, redeemable at next purchase, to customers in addition to a sales receipt upon completion of a sale. The new solution was used by Barclaycard.

In 2012, the company entered Iceland via Valitor, which adopted the *Welcome XLS* solution, and made it in Red Herring's Europe Top 100. In September 2014, Collinson Group acquired Welcome Real Time to improve the group's loyalty capability.
