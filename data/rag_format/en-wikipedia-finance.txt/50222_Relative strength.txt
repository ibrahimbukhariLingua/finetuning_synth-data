Relative strength


# Relative strength



**Relative strength** is a ratio of a stock price performance to a market average (index) performance. It is used in technical analysis.

It is not to be confused with relative strength index.

To calculate the relative strength of a particular stock, divide the percentage change over some time period by the percentage change of a particular index over the same time period.
