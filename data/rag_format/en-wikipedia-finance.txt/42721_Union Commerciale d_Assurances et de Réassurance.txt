The Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP) provided technical assistance.
It was approved by ministerial order No. 540/326 on 12 September 1986.
Share capital was 60,000,000 BIF, of which the state of Burundi held 30%, UAP held 10% and Burundian private shareholders held 60%.
Capital was increased to 150,000,000 BIF in 1990.
UAP sold their shares in 1995.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Under the transitional government's 2002–05 privatization program, the state's 12% stake of the Commercial Insurance and Reinsurance Union of Burundi was to be done through the issue of an invitation to tender in July 2004, followed by share transfer in October 2004.
Under the terms of the World Bank's Economic Reform Support Grant, UCAR was one of 14 enterprises targeted in the 2006–2008 privatization program. The others were OPHAVET, BRB, *Abattoir Public de Bujumbura* (APB), REGIDESO, ONATEL, SOSUMO, COTEBU, OCIBU, OTB, SOCABU and SIP.
The state of Burundi sold their shares in 2007.

In July 2008 there was one woman among the four senior managers, and one out of the nine on the management board.

The Insurance Code requires separation of Life insurance activities and Non-Life insurance activities.
In 2017 the company was split into two companies, *UCAR Vie et Capitalisation* for life insurance, and *UCAR Assurances Générales* for general insurance.

UCAR Vie et Capitalisation was created on 30 May 2017 to comply with law number 07/01/2014 Article 279, which states that companies that carry out both life insurance and non-life insurance must separate their life insurance from property and casualty insurance.
It is a public limited company with share capital of 2,000,000,000 BIF.
UCAR Vie et Capitalisation was provisionally approved on 4 August 2017 and definitely approved on 24 August 2018.
