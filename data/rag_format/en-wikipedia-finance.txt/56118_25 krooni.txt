25 krooni


# 25 krooni



The **25 krooni** banknote (**25 EEK**) is a denomination of the Estonian kroon, the former currency of Estonia. A. H. Tammsaare (1870–1940), who was a famous Estonian writer of classical literature, is featured on the front side of the bill, which is why the 25 krooni banknote is often called a *"Tammekas or Tammsaare"*.

A view of Vargamäe is featured on the reverse side of the banknote. Before the replacement of the EEK by the euro, the 25 krooni was frequently used in everyday transactions. It can be exchanged indefinitely at the currency museum of Eesti Pank for €1.60.
