## Software and Technology

Optimove is a SaaS application that implements a systematic approach to planning, executing, measuring and optimizing a company's customer marketing plan with the goal of maximizing customer lifetime value. The software models each customer's behavior and preferences in order to predict which marketing campaigns will be most relevant for each individual.

The marketing channels supported by Optimove include email, SMS, mobile push notification, website/app pop-ups, Facebook Custom Audiences and Google Ads.

The software is based on a combination of technologies, including predictive customer modeling, customer micro-segmentation, multi-channel campaign automation, real-time campaign triggers, and systematic campaign optimization using scientific control methodologies. The application's primary interface is a calendar-based marketing management tool that helps users track and optimize campaigns. Campaigns are analyzed as measurable marketing experiments so that users can determine the financial uplift that each marketing campaign generated.

The Optimove product doesn't collect or use any customer-identifying demographic data, which eases privacy concerns.
