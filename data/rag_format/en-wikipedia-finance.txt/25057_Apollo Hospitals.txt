## Controversies

In 2016, a patient died at Apollo's Bilaspur Hospital during a treatment for stomach pain. While the hospital attributed his death to poisoning, the post-mortem report remained inconclusive pending a chemical analysis. The forensic laboratory report, obtained in 2019, revealed no presence of poison. Later in 2023, four doctors were arrested but subsequently released on bail.

In a 2019 order, the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (DSCDRC) found Indraprastha Apollo Hospital negligent in the treatment of a 24-year-old woman who died in 2007. As a result, the Commission directed the hospital to pay the woman's father a compensation of ₹10 lakh.

British newspaper *Telegraph* in a December 2023 report alleged that the chain's Indraprastha Apollo Hospital was involved in facilitating a "cash-for-kidney" racket, luring impoverished villagers from Myanmar to sell their kidneys to wealthy Burmese patients through forged documents and fabricated family ties. The Government of Delhi consequently initiated an investigation against the hospital.

In March 2024, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission fined Apollo Speciality Hospital in Chennai and two doctors ₹30 lakh for medical negligence. The case involved a patient who did not regain consciousness after spinal surgery in April 2015 and remained in a vegetative state until his death in April 2017.
