BRW Rich 200, 2016


# BRW Rich 200, 2016



The ***BRW* Rich 200, 2016** is the 33rd annual survey of the wealthiest people resident in Australia, published in *The Australian Financial Review* on 27 May 2016. From its establishment in 1984 and up until the publication of the 2016 list, the survey had been published in either hardcopy and/or online format in the *BRW*, or formerly, the *Business Review Weekly*. On 4 March 2016, Fairfax Media announced the closure of the *BRW* website, and redirected the site to a new section of *The Australian Financial Review*. Rich lists are now published in *The Australian Financial Review Magazine* and in 2017 were rebranded as the *Financial Review Rich List*.

In the 2016 list, the net worth of the wealthiest individual, Harry Triguboff AO, was A$10.62 billion. The combined wealth of the 200 individuals was calculated as A$197.3 billion; compared with a combined wealth of A$6.4 billion in 1984 when the *BRW* Rich 200 commenced.
