The article related Applico to the fast-growing mobile startup based in NYC seen in the HBO show Girls and describes Applico's strategy of focusing on mobile technology: "If there's an art, it's not so much in making a pretty app as it is spotting the next wave before the competition does."

Applico licensed its data product, Platform Insights, to WisdomTree in 2019. WisdomTree launched PLAT, an ETF composed of platform businesses, and announced that Applico’s data was involved in the creation of the ETF
