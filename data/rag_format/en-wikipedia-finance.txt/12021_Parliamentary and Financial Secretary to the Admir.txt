The **Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty** also known as the **Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Board of Admiralty** was a position on the Board of Admiralty and a civil officer of the British Royal Navy.

## History

The office was originally created in 1625 with the post holders holding titles under various names such as **Secretaries to the Lords Admiral, Admiralty, Committees and Commissions**. In July 1660 the post of **Secretary to the Admiralty** was formally created which lasted until 18 June 1763 when the office was then restyled **First Secretary to the Admiralty** this remained in place until 1870 when the First Secretary was renamed **Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty**, while the office of Second Secretary to the Admiralty was renamed Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty. In 1886, the Parliamentary Secretary was renamed **Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty**. In 1929 the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary is made a full member of the Board of Admiralty. In 1930, the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary served as Civil Lord to the Board of Admiralty. In 1959 the office of Parliamentary and Financial Secretary was abolished with the approval of parliament. In 1964 the Admiralty and thus Board of Admiralty was also abolished and merged into a new larger Ministry of Defence under the control of the Minister of State and Under-Secretary of State for the Navy.
