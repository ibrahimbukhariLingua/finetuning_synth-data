## History

The "doughnut hole" is an approximately 1,000-acre (4.0 km²) unincorporated area surrounded by the city of Redlands in southwestern San Bernardino County, California. Citrus groves and farmland were scattered throughout the area since the 19th century.

The city of Redlands began making public works improvements in the 1970s, after the county's Local Agency Formation Commission indicated the city would eventually be allowed to annex the area. Majestic Realty acquired the majority of the land and proposed the Citrus Plaza shopping center in 1993. Negotiations with the city government through the 1990s deteriorated into legal disputes. Majestic Realty successfully lobbied the state government to pass a law in 2000 removing Redlands' control over the area. Local governments and Majestic Realty came to a settlement in 2000, and the center opened in 2003.

In 2003, voters in Redlands passed Measure N, a tax-sharing agreement that allocates 90% of sales tax generated in the Donut Hole to the city, and the remainder to the county. By 2023, the city is receiving 100% of the sales tax revenue.

An expansion called **Mountain Grove** at Citrus Plaza opened in 2015.
