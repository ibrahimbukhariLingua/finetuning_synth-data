Forvis Mazars


# Forvis Mazars



**Forvis Mazars** is an internationally integrated partnership, specialising in audit, accounting and consulting employing more than 40,000 professionals in over 100 countries. The organisation emerged from a 2023 agreement between Mazars and FORVIS to create the Forvis Mazars network, which launched in June 2024. The network comprises Forvis Mazars Group SC operating globally except in the United States, and Forvis Mazars LLP (formerly FORVIS), operating in the US.

Combined, the network constitutes one of the world's ten largest accounting firms by revenue with earnings of over $5 billion, making it the most significant new entrant to the global rankings in decades.

Forvis Mazars Group operates as a single integrated partnership and publishes its consolidated financial accounts, a move it states is unusual for private audit and advisory firms.


## History

The original Mazars firm was formed in Rouen, Normandy in France in 1945 by Robert Mazars. He would serve as chief executive officer until 1983, when Patrick de Cambourg was appointed the position. de Cambourg began internationalizing the local firm, which counted 33 employees in 1977. From 2011 to 2016, Philippe Castagnac served as chief executive officer. He was succeeded by Hervé Hélias, who currently holds the position.

In 2016, Mazars announces the integration of the Chinese firm ZhongShen ZhongHuan into its partnership. As of January 1, the Mazars Group partnership extends to 77 countries and 17,000 employees work for Mazars. In 2017, Mazars acquires Zettafox, a French prescriptive data analytics startup, and announces the creation of its Lab to accelerate the internal transformation of its businesses and enrich its offerings.

In 2023, Mazars signed an agreement with Forvis to create a new global audit and advisory network under the brand Forvis Mazars, effective June 2024. Through this strategic partnership, US-focused Forvis will have the opportunity to expand into global markets, while Mazars will be able to strengthen its US presence - a market where it has faced challenges establishing itself since its 2010 entry.

The two firms, Forvis Mazars LLP and Forvis Mazars Group SC, are still owned by their respective partnerships with separate profit pools but are overseen by a global board, responsible for coordinating the network strategy.
