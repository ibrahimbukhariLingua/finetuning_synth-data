## History

In April 2018, SpankChain offered a $25,000 reward to sex workers who revealed information about political clients who supported the passing of the FOSTA/SESTA acts, which regulated sex work in the United States. The company reportedly had 6,000 users as of October 2018.

In 2018, a malicious attacker stole 165 Ether (valued at $40,000) from SpankChain by exploiting a vulnerability in the Ethereum blockchain. After the cryptocurrency bubble of 2018 burst, the company downsized to eight employees.
