## History


### Interbank a Interbanka

The original bank was established in 1991 as a Swiss-Hungarian joint venture under the name InterBank, akciová společnost (joint-stock company) and obtained a banking license on 28.12.1991; the current valid license (after the re-licensing) was received under the name Interbanka, akciová společnost (joint-stock company) on 13. 2. 2004 and was supplemented on 6.5.2005.

Between 1993 and 1997 a number of changes in the shareholder structure took place; this transition period stabilized at the end of 1997, when the German Bayerische Landesbank became the majority shareholder and the Hungarian Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank (MKB) and the Austrian Bank für Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG (BAWAG) became minority shareholders.


### BAWAG Bank CZ

In September 2003, BAWAG became the sole shareholder of Interbank a.s. and in June 2004 the bank was renamed BAWAG Bank CZ a.s. In September 2004, BAWAG acquired 100% of the shares of another bank on the Czech market - Dresdner Bank CZ a.s.

Dresdner Bank CZ a.s. was founded in 1991 as a joint venture of the French Banque National de Paris (BNP, later BNP Paribas) and the German Dresdner Bank AG, and under the original name BNP-Dresdner Bank (ČSFR) a.s. obtained a banking license on 3.9.1991. In 2001 Dresdner Bank AG became the sole shareholder of the bank, which was given a new license (re-licensed after the amendment to the Banking Act) under the name Dresdner Bank CZ a.s. on 4.11.2003. After BAWAG became the sole shareholder, Dresdner Bank CZ a.s. was renamed BAWAG International Bank CZ a.s. and ceased to exist on 31 March 2005 as a result of the merger with BAWAG Bank CZ a.s. as a successor bank.


### LBBW Bank CZ

In September 2008, another change occurred when German Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) became the sole shareholder and BAWAG Bank CZ a.s. was renamed LBBW Bank CZ a.s. as part of the LBBW Group. The parent LBBW is both a commercial bank and a central bank of local savings banks in Baden-Württemberg, Saxony, and Rhineland-Palatinate. It is also one of the largest banks in Germany.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
