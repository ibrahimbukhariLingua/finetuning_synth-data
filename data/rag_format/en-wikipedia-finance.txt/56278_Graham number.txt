Graham number


# Graham number



The **Graham number** or **Benjamin Graham number** is a figure used in securities investing that measures a stock's so-called fair value. Named after Benjamin Graham, the founder of value investing, the Graham number can be calculated as follows:

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {22.5\times ({\text{earnings per share}})\times ({\text{book value per share}})}}}

The final number is, theoretically, the maximum price that a defensive investor should pay for the given stock. Put another way, a stock priced below the Graham Number would be considered a good value, if it also meets a number of other criteria.

The Number represents the geometric mean of the maximum that one would pay based on earnings and based on book value. Graham writes:

> Current price should not be more than 11⁄2 times the book value last reported. However a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the *product* of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 11⁄2 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)

## Alternative calculation

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing *net income* by *shares outstanding*. Book value is another way of saying *shareholders' equity*. Therefore, book value per share is calculated by dividing *equity* by *shares outstanding*. Consequently, the formula for the Graham number can also be written as follows:

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {15\times 1.5\times \left({\frac {\text{net income}}{\text{shares outstanding}}}\right)\times \left({\frac {\mathrm {shareholders'\ equity} }{\text{shares outstanding}}}\right)}}}
