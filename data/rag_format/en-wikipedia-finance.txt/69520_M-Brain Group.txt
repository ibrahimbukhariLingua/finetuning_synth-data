## History

The company's long-time CEO Marjukka Nyberg founded M-Brain in 1999.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Initially, the company focused on print media analysis and measurement services, but the service offering was expanded to cover social and editorial online media, as well as the monitoring and analysis of television and radio broadcasts.

By 2001, M-Brain launched its first digital media monitoring service, which allowed the company to start offering multilingual online monitoring services. M-Brain secured its first outside investor in 2006, when the state-owned venture capital investment firm Veraventure Oy acquired a minority interest in the company.


### Key developments

2007: Kimmo Valtonen was appointed M-Brain's CTO. His responsibilities include R&D.

2011: During 2011, M-Brain attracted new investors, as Veritas Pension Insurance and Oy Ingman Finance Ab invested in the company. This enabled M-Brain to acquire its Swedish competitor Cision AB's Finnish subsidiary Oy Cision Finland Ab. Through this acquisition, M-Brain more than doubled its revenue and number of employees.

2012: In 2012, M-Brain made another acquisition by buying Esmerk, which provides business intelligence management services. Through this acquisition, M-Brain became the biggest company in its field in the Nordic countries and among the six largest firms in Europe. In December 2012, M-Brain launched a new SaaS tool, M-Adaptive, which enables the monitoring and analysis of the impact and results of media and marketing campaigns in digital, social and print media.

2013: Previously M-Brain operated under the Esmerk brand outside of Finland. As of 1 January 2013, the company has operated under the M-Brain brand in all countries. In July 2013, M-Brain made the acquisition of Whitevector, a social media monitoring company in Finland.

2014: On September 4, 2014 M-Brain Oy signed an agreement to purchase the entire share capital of GIA (Global Intelligence Alliance) Group.
