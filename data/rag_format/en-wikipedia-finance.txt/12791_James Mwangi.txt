In 1997, the society began to sell shares to customers and pay annual dividends.

In 2006, Equity Bank listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). On 18 June 2009, the group's stock cross-listed on the Uganda Securities Exchange and the Rwanda Stock Exchange in 2015.

In 2020, Equity Bank was granted approval to merge two subsidiaries (Equity Bank Congo (EBC) and Banque Commercial du Congo (BCDC)) in the Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC). The two subsidiaries formed a new bank by the name Equity Banque Commercial du Congo (Equity BCDC) which made it the second largest bank in DRC.
