## History


### The Beginning

The School of Business opened its doors on September 22, 1937 and was known as the School of Store Service Education. Henry Hibbs, president of the Richmond Division of the College of William and Mary, had secured a federal grant to train executives for the growing retail sector. The school trained educators to teach salesmanship, retailing, and department store training programs. VCU School of Business has grown from an initial class of 11 students to a student body of nearly 4,000.


### 1940s G.I. Bill of Rights

In 1944, there were eight men enrolled full-time. By 1948, male enrollment had increased to 890 students, transforming RPI from chiefly women's college into a coeducational institution. This was primarily caused by the enactment of the G.I. Bill of Rights. Accounting was added as a degree and in 1946. The Department of Business Administration became the School of Business.


### 1958 Center for Corporate Education

In 1958, the School of Business founded the Adult Business Education Center to serve area companies through short-term courses, workshops and seminars. It is now known as the Center for Corporate Education.


### 1986 Experimental Economics Lab

### 1999-2007 Campaign for the School of Business

Steven A. Markel, vice chairman of Markel Corporation, who was also chair of the school's executive leadership committee, and William H. Goodwin Jr., president and CEO of CCA Industries Inc. chaired of the VCU School of Engineering foundation. He came up with the idea to join forces and expand VCU's campus across Belvidere Street. An initial $10 million gift from Steve and Kathie Markel (the largest donation in the school's history) and $1 million from Tom and Vickie Snead, initiated a business campaign to bring more donated funds into the School of Business Foundation. The Foundation raised $51.5 million, which funded the construction of Snead Hall.
