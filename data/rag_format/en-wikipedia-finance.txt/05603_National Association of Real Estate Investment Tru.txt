## History

On September 14, 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation for a new approach to real estate investment. The following day, on September 15, 1960, the National Association of Real Estate was incorporated. This association gradually rebranded into Nareit, which has partnered with several other entities in its investor outreach endeavors, most notably the FTSE Group and the European Public Real Estate Association. They have established the FTSE EPRA / Nareit Global Real Estate Index Series.
