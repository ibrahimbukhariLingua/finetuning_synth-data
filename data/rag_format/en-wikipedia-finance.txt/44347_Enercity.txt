# Enercity



The **Enercity Aktiengesellschaft** (stylized as *enercity*; formerly *Stadtwerke Hannover Aktiengesellschaft*) in Hanover is a municipal energy supply and energy services company. Its revenue was €9.2 billion in 2023, and it employed more than 3,300 people across the group. In 2018, the brand name *enercity* became the official company name when *Stadtwerke Hannover Aktiengesellschaft* was renamed to *enercity Aktiengesellschaft*. The owners are *Versorgungs- und Verkehrsgesellschaft Hannover* (76%) and *Thüga AG* (24%).


## History


### 1875–1922: Construction of the first gas, water, and electricity plants

Around the middle of the 16th century, Hannover had a water distribution system consisting of wells and pipelines, which remained in operation for over 300 years through continuous expansions and maintenance. In 1875, the city's magistrate decided to construct a groundwater plant in Ricklingen. The population of Hanover, exceeding 100,000, necessitated this decision as the simple wells could no longer meet the city's water demands. In 1878, the new waterworks in Ricklingen commenced operation, followed by the construction of facilities in Laatzen-Grasdorf in 1899 and at the Fuhrberger Feld near Fuhrberg in 1911.

As early as 1825, a contract was concluded with the London-based Imperial Continental Gas Association (ICGA), assigning the British company the task of replacing the old street lamps, which were still operated with tallow, with new gas lamps, and maintaining them. In the same year as the contract was signed, the Glocksee gasworks was built, becoming Germany's first gas plant.

In 1883, following the Ricklingen waterworks and the Glocksee gasworks, a combined plant for generating electrical energy was established. Finally, in 1891, the first electricity plant in Osterstraße was connected to the grid.


### Städtische Betriebswerke and Stadtwerke Hannover, conversion into a stock corporation

In 1922, the individual water, electricity, and gas works were merged into a single company: the *Städtische Betriebswerke*. During the Third Reich, the operational facilities were also brought under Nazi control. Additionally, during World War II, at least 123 forced labourers were employed.

The period following World War II was initially marked by energy supply problems. Through reconstruction efforts and the post–World War II economic expansion, the *Städtische Betriebswerke* also benefited. New facilities were established, and the expansion of networks into previously undeveloped areas was promoted. In 1952, the *Städtische Betriebswerke* were renamed *Stadtwerke Hannover*. The heating power plant Linden, which commenced operations in 1962, laid the foundation for the company's district heating network.

The economic upswing of the 1950s and 1960s brought double-digit growth rates to the *Stadtwerke Hannover*, prompting the City Council of Hanover to decide in November 1970 to transform the utility facilities into a joint-stock company. On December 21, 1970, the state capital of Hanover became the sole shareholder of *Stadtwerke Hannover AG*. The conversion of the *Stadtwerke Hannover* into a joint-stock company was necessary to consolidate Stadtwerke Hannover and Üstra under the holding company *Versorgungs- und Verkehrsgesellschaft Hannover mbH* (VVG). Among other things, this enabled the profits of *Stadtwerke Hannover* to be offset against Üstra's losses.

The natural gas business began in the early 1970s. In 1982, the first cavern storage facility in Empelde was put into operation, and in 1989, the *Gemeinschaftskraftwerk Hannover* (joint power plant Hannover) in Stöcken commenced operations. The first unit of the Stöcken coal-fired power plant is scheduled to be gradually shut down starting from late 2024 as part of the coal phase-out.


### Since the 1990s: Energy transition

As a result of the increasing liberalization of energy markets, in 1996, the *Stadtwerke Hannover* became *Enercity*.

Since the early 1990s, the company has been committed to the use of biomass for heat and power generation. The largest project in this regard is the acquisition of shares in *Danpower GmbH* in 2006.

With the decision to transition towards renewable energies, Enercity began shifting its focus from fossil fuels to renewables in the 2010s. From 2015 to 2023, Susanna Zapreva chaired the company; she played a significant role in implementing this change in direction. In 2019, Enercity acquired *Gamesa Energie Deutschland GmbH*, a project development company based in Oldenburg, from *Siemens Gamesa*, aiming to increase its investments in onshore wind power plants. Subsequently, among other ventures, Enercity purchased 166 wind turbines from the *Norderland Group* in East Frisia.

In 2022, the share of electricity from renewable energy sources was approximately 51%, while for heat generation it was around 21%. According to the company, the goal is to achieve a renewable energy share of 85% by 2030. The company's coal phase-out is scheduled to begin in 2024 and if possible be completed by 2026, but no later than 2030. Together with the city of Hanover, a plan has been developed to achieve climate neutrality in electricity and heat by 2035.


## Company structure

In 2023, Enercity AG achieved a revenue of approximately €9.2 billion. It offers electricity, solar energy, heat, district heating, e-mobility, intelligent technologies, and drinking water.

From 1975 to 2023, the head office was located in the Ihme-Zentrum in Hanover's Linden-Mitte district; since August 2023, it has been located in a new building on the Glocksee site in Calenberger Neustadt. Enercity's customer centre is located in central Hanover, near Kröpcke.

Enercity's share capital is owned by *Versorgungs- und Verkehrsgesellschaft Hannover* (VVG) at 76%. Another 24% is held by *Thüga AG*, headquartered in Munich, in which Enercity AG is also a shareholder. A significant portion of the company's profits is returned to VVG and the city of Hanover through profit distribution and concession fees. Enercity holds several stakes in energy companies in the Hanover region and operates the business for the two major power plants in the districts of Stöcken and Linden, as well as for the gas storage facility in Empelde.


## Business segments and products

The company supplies over 700,000 people in the Hanover region with electricity, natural gas, district heating, drinking water and energy services.


### Electricity

Since January 1, 2018, Enercity has been supplying its private customers nationwide with 100% green energy sourced from solar, wind, biomass, and water. Enercity operates numerous power plants in Hannover for electricity and district heating production: the Heizkraftwerk Linden (Linden combined heat and power plant) in Linden-Nord, the Herrenhausen power plant in Leinhausen, and, in collaboration with VW, the coal-fired *Gemeinschaftskraftwerk Hannover* in Stöcken, which is planned to be phased out gradually starting from late 2024 and no later than 2030. The plan is to replace coal power in the future with sources including waste heat, recycled wood, waste utilization, and sewage sludge incineration.


### Wind and solar

In 2019, Enercity supplied approximately 628,000 megawatt-hours of wind energy. In 2022, around 60 wind farms with 166 wind turbines were acquired from the Norderland Group in East Frisia. The transaction was completed in January 2023. As of 2023, Enercity owned 83 wind farms with 348 wind turbines.

With its subsidiary, *Enercity solution GmbH*, Enercity offers photovoltaic systems for purchase nationwide in Germany. In addition to providing components and installation, customers receive services such as remote monitoring, maintenance, and insurance.
