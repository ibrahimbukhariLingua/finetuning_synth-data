# Kazuo Ueda



**Kazuo Ueda** (植田 和男, *Ueda Kazuo*, born September 20, 1951) is a Japanese economist who has been serving as the 32nd Governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) since April 2023.

He is a professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) and also worked briefly as a professor at Kyoritsu Women’s University after his retirement from UTokyo in 2017. He was the dean of the Faculty of Economics at UTokyo and president of the Japanese Economic Association.


## Biography

Ueda graduated from the University of Tokyo with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and then studied at Faculty of Economics under Hirofumi Uzawa, Ryutaro Komiya, and Koichi Hamada. In 1980, Ueda received his PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His doctoral advisor was Stanley Fischer.

After working at the University of British Columbia and Osaka University, he returned to his alma mater in 1989, retiring in 2017 to become Professor Emeritus. From April 2011 to June 2012, Ueda was president of the Japan Economic Association.

In February 2023, Ueda was nominated by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to succeed the long-serving Haruhiko Kuroda as Governor of the Bank of Japan. He was an unexpected choice as the position is usually filled by a senior official from the Ministry of Finance or the bank itself. Ueda began his term in April 2023. On 19 March 2024, the BoJ under Ueda decided to end the zero-interest-rate policy and the yield curve control. This was a milestone for the long-stagnant Japanese economy, as the bank rate had not been raised for 17 years due to deflation or very low inflation, which the country finally got out of with the help of the 2021-2023 global inflation surge.
