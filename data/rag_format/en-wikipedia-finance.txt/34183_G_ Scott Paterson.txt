## Career


### Start in the investment industry

After graduating from university in 1985, Paterson began in the retail brokerage side of the investment world. Starting out as a retail broker at Dominion Securities Pitfield, Paterson became known as the 'cold-call cowboy' and became head of the firm's President's Club, as well as its top broker of those in their first three years in the industry, as measured by commissions earned.

After being recruited by the Richardson Greenshields firm in 1987, Paterson landed a position as a senior investment banker at Midland Walwyn Inc, a newly formed brokerage company. It was at Midland, where Paterson began to focus his attention as an investor on the technology industry.
Paterson was considered the "IPO King" at Midland, and was considered for the role of head of investment banking when late in 1994, Midland Walwyn President Peter Wallace and his allies attempted to gain control of the company and unseat then chief executive officer, Bob Shultz. This failed and Wallace and others were fired. Veteran banker Bob McLeish was given the head of investment banking role and Paterson began to look for an alternative venue to build a tech-focused boutique brokerage firm.


### Yorkton Securities Inc.

In 1995, Paterson was recruited again, this time by Yorkton Securities Inc., a small, independent, mining-focused brokerage house. In his six years at Yorkton, Paterson helped transform the brokerage from a mining firm to a knowledge industries firm that targeted technology, internet, film and television, and biotechnology as their industries of focus.
Paterson also helped build out Yorkton's retail presence to $3 billion in assets and helped take total firm revenue to $244 million in 2001, with a pre-tax profit of $56 million.
Paterson was promoted at the company and, in October 1998, at the age of 34, Paterson became Yorkton's chairman and chief executive officer. Paterson served as chairman of Yorkton from 1998 until December 2001. As chairman, Paterson pulled the company into "tech stocks just in time for the Silicon Valley gold rush of the late '90s".


#### Controversy at Yorkton Securities

In March 2000, the *Vancouver Sun* reported that Yorkton had played multiple roles as investor, promoter and underwriter of a tech start-up known as Book4Golf.com Corp. This action raised questions about conflicts of interest for the firmᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and in December 2001, Paterson left Yorkton Securities. This incident was considered to be the reason for Paterson's departure.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In relation to the Book4Golf.com incident Paterson reached a settlement agreement with the Ontario Securities Commission for investor conduct that the commission believed was against public interest. As part of the agreement, Paterson was asked to pay $1.1 million Canadian dollars to the commission and was barred from trading for six months. This settlement came despite the OSC stating Paterson never breached any securities laws. The OSC head of enforcement Michael Watson said "the information before the commission on which Paterson settled did not involve the breach of securities law. Paterson was not involved with insider trading." Paterson fulfilled all parts of the settlement agreement.
