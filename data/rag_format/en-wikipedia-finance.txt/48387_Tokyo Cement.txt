In 1983, the construction of the manufacturing plant began in Trincomalee and the company was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1984. The Trincomalee cement factory, the second largest cement plant in the country at the time, was bombed in May 1986 by the Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) which caused to halt the production and damage worth several million rupees. The production commenced in 1988. Fuji Cement Company (Lanka) a fully owned subsidiary of the company commenced operations in 1998.

In 2020, the company entered into an agreement with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka for an expansion plan worth US$12 million.


## Operations

In 2021, the company recommended to the government of Sri Lanka to extend the restriction imposed on importing cement in light of the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee. Managing Director S. R. Gnanam stated that the local manufacturers could meet 90% of the country's demand for cement. The revival of the construction sector in the post-pandemic times is expected to increase the revenue of the Tokyo Cement by 12% in 2022.
