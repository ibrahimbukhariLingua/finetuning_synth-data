In December 2017, the Ugandan government reached consensus with the power station's financiers on restructuring the loans and waiving taxes on the power generated, to enable the cost of power to the consumer to reduce. In July 2018, with about US$450 million of the US$900 million construction loan repaid, the remaining loan was restructured and extended for another 15 years, thereby lowering the loan payments and related electricity tariffs to as low as US$0.08 per unit, for large industrial customers. The new lower electricity rates were expected to commence in July 2018.
