## Description

The Yotel concept came about when the founder was on a first-class flight. The team enlisted the help of aircraft cabin designers Priestman Goode to design and build a prototype room known as a 'cabin'. The original prototype cabin was displayed at an exhibition called 100% Design in London.

Hotels have self-check-in kiosks and keyless entry, convertible double beds, adjustable mood lighting and systems. Furthermore, the New York hotel is home to the YOBOT, the world's first robotic luggage concierge. The hotels in Boston and Singapore have delivery robots which take amenities to the rooms. These robots are programmed to negotiate lifts and corridors and they can interact with people.
