## History

LRF was created in 1971 by fusion of two organisations: *Riksförbundet Landsbygdens folk* (RLF), an organisation for farmers founded in 1929, and *Sveriges Lantbruksförbund* (SL), an organisation for agricultural production cooperatives founded in 1940, and which had a background in *Sveriges Allmänna Lantbrukssällskap* (SAL), founded in 1917.
