## Legacy

A bronze bust of Mittelhauser was commissioned the University of Queensland's Faculty of Business, Economics and Law in partnership with UQ Art Museum in 2018. It was created by Sydney-based sculptor Wendy Black. It resides in the courtyard of the University's Colin Clark building, to recognise her significance to the finance, business and economics discipline. The Dr Margaret Mittelheuser AM and Morgans Prize in MBA Accounting and Finance was established in 2006.

The State Library of Queensland's 'Mittelheuser Scholar in Residence' program aims to attract leading thinkers who will develop new ideas, tools, strategies or services that benefit both Queensland’s GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) sector and State Library of Queensland.
