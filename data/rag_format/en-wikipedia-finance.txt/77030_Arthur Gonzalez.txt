## Significant cases

Gonzalez handled the Chrysler LLC bankruptcy case until his retirement. Previously, Gonzalez presided over the bankruptcy proceedings for WorldCom, at that point the largest U.S. bankruptcy case (since overtaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008), and Enron. The criminal proceedings against the corporate executives of WorldCom and Enron did not originate from the bankruptcy proceedings before Gonzalez via mandatory referral of possible crimes under Title 18 U.S.C. ยง 3057; in contrast the post petition corporate entities both sought releases and compensation for the benefit of their current and former senior officers.
