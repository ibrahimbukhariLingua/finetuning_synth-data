State-owned enterprises of the United Kingdom


# State-owned enterprises of the United Kingdom



After extensive privatisation of the public sector during the Margaret Thatcher administration, there remain few statutory corporations in the UK. Privatisation began in the late 1970s, and notable privatisations include the Central Electricity Generating Board, British Rail, and more recently Royal Mail. After the Hatfield rail crash accident, the British government decided to intervene and in 2002 renationalised Railtrack (which was responsible for the maintenance of railway tracks and signals) into Network Rail.
