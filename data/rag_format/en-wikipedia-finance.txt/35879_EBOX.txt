**EBOX** is a brand of Bell Canada headquartered in Longueuil, Quebec. **EBOX** offers a wide range of high-speed Internet plans in Ontario and Quebec as well as VoIP Digital Home Phone service. **EBOX** also provides IPTV (Internet Protocol television).


## History

Between 2007 and 2012 *EBOX*, formerly known as Electronic Box, increased its net sales by 1,859%. Following a decision from the CRTC in 2011 favoring Canadian independent telecom service providers, Electronic Box was one of the first independent providers to offer Internet services at a reduced rate.

In 2016, Electronic Box simplified its name by rebranding to EBOX.

In 2017, *EBOX* launched their largest advertising campaign in collaboration with the DentsuBos advertising agency which allowed them to grow their customer base to 70,000 subscribers.

In April 2018, *EBOX* launched their IPTV service. which enabled them to expand their customer base to 130,000 subscribers.

In 2019, *EBOX* was ranked 227 as a PROFIT 500 company which recognizes the top 500 Canadian companies which had the highest annual growth.

In a surprise decision in May 2021, the CRTC cancelled their wholesale tariff rate reductions that were proposed two years earlier in 2019. This had a devastating impact on many independent telecom providers such as EBOX who had already lowered their rates in anticipation of having the reduced access rates implemented retroactively. EBOX CEO Jean-Philippe Béïque subsequently criticised the CRTC's decision, which granted large telecom incumbent providers to charge what they would like to. » In January 2022, EBOX announced a rate increase for all of their subscribers, which marked the first one 2015. However, the increase was reverted on February 10, 2022, before it was even fully implemented with no explanation provided.

On February 24, 2022, Bell formally announced their acquisition of EBOX. EBOX co-founders Jean-Philippe Béique and Dominic Létourneau announced at the same time that they have resigned from EBOX and the company will continue to operate as an independent brand. Some of the reasons they provided for the sale was due to financial challenges caused by the CRTC's 2021 decision along with increased costs related to higher data usage caused by a much higher number of people working from home.
