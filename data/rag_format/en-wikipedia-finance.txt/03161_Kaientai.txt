The **Kaientai (海援隊, *Kaientai*, "Maritime Support Force")** was a trading and shipping company and private navy, considered to be the first corporation in modern Japan.

Kaientai, originally named **Kameyama Shachū** (亀山社中, "Kameyama Troupe"), was founded by Sakamoto Ryōma in Nagasaki in 1865 during the Bakumatsu, and it was initially funded by the Satsuma Domain and other groups and domains.
