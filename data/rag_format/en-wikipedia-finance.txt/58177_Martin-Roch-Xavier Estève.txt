**Martin-Roch-Xavier Estève** (21 July 1772 - 1 March 1853) was Napoleon’s Treasurer General under the First Empire.


## Biography


### Early life

Estève was born on 21 July 1772 in Montpellier. He was the son of François Estève and Elisabeth-Louise Beraud.


### Career under Napoleon

Engaged in 1792, Estève began in the services of the "army payroll."

Napoleon had known Estève in Italy in 1796 and appreciated his qualities. Estève followed the First Consul in the campaigns in Italy and Egypt, and was distinguished in his fidelity and his ability in carrying out jobs that were entrusted to him. He was appointed Deputy Paymaster General to the Treasury of the Army of Italy. Later, he was appointed Paymaster General of the Army of the East. He spent three years as "director general-accountant of public revenues of Egypt." In a country where resources were meager, Estève's administrative qualities excelled. He managed the finances of the new colony and reformed the tax system. His mission was essential, as it was necessary for the French to live of their conquest due to their naval disaster at the Battle of the Nile which led to them being cut off from France.

After he returned to France, he was attached to the household of Napoleon, where he brought in a clerk and his future successor, Guillaume Peyrusse, whose rise he promoted. He resided in this capacity in the Imperial Palace of Tuileries. He managed the affairs of the house of Napoleon and Napoleon then made him treasurer of his house. He was appointed treasurer of the government in 1801 and Treasurer General of the Crown in 1804. The Treasurer General, an officer of the house, was the principal administrator of the funds in paid by the State under the civil list. He was charged after the Battle of Jena in 1806 with managing the Prussian finances as "Administrator general of the finances and domains of the conquered countries beyond the Elbe." He was made Count of the Empire on 24 February 1809.

Nicolas François, Count Mollien, wrote in his memoirs that "Estève had perfectly justified this confidence by his probity." However, symptoms of serious alterations in his health after several years as treasurer, had begun to worry Napoleon. Napoleon thought he could not keep a diminished man in service. After a dispute with the Emperor, Estève resigned and in December 1811, he handed over his position as Treasurer General of the Crown to Baron de La Bouillerie, who contrary to what his successor did, handed over part of the treasure to the Count of Artois.
