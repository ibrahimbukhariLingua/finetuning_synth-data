Icelandic króna


# Icelandic króna



The **króna** (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈkʰrouːna]) or **krona** (sometimes called **Icelandic crown**; sign: **kr**; code: **ISK**) is the currency of Iceland.
One króna was formerly divided into 100 eyrir (plural "aurar").


## Name

Like the Nordic currencies (such as the Danish krone, Swedish krona and Norwegian krone) that participated in the historical Scandinavian Monetary Union, the name *króna* (meaning *crown*) comes from the Latin word *corona* ("crown").

The name "Icelandic crown" is sometimes used alternatively, for example in the financial markets.


## First krona, 1874–1981

The Danish krone was introduced to Iceland in 1874, replacing the earlier Danish currency, the rigsdaler. In 1885, Iceland began issuing its own banknotes.

The Icelandic krona separated from the Danish krone after the dissolution of the Scandinavian Monetary Union at the start of World War I and Icelandic sovereignty from Denmark in 1918. The first coins were issued in 1922.

Iceland was forced to devalue the Icelandic krona in 1922, by 23% against the Danish krone, which saw the beginning of an independent monetary policy in Iceland, and was to be the first of many subsequent devaluations of the krona.

In 1925 the krona was pegged to the British pound for the next 14 years until the spring of 1939. Later in 1939 the currency was pegged to the US dollar, which was maintained until 1949.


### Coins

Iceland's first coins were 10 and 25 aurar pieces introduced in 1922. These were followed in 1925 by 1 krona and 2 krona pieces and in 1926 by 1, 2 and 5 aurar pieces. In 1946, the coins' designs were altered to remove the royal monogram (CXR), following abolition of the Icelandic monarchy (which had formed a personal union with Denmark) in 1944.

Starting in 1967, new coins were introduced due to a considerable fall in the value of the krona. 10 krona coins were introduced in that year, followed by 50 aurar and 5 krona pieces in 1969 and 50 krona pieces in 1970.


### Banknotes

The first notes issued in 1885 by the *Landssjóður Íslands* were in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 krona. In 1904, the Bank of Iceland (*Íslands Banki*) took over note production and introduced 100 krona notes. In 1921, the *Ríkissjóður Íslands* began issuing paper money, with notes for 1, 5, 10 and 50 krona.

In 1928, another bank, the *Landsbanki Íslands*, took over issuance of denominations of 5 krona and above, with the *Ríkissjóður Íslands* continuing to issue 1 krona notes until 1947. The Landsbanki Íslands introduced 500 krona notes in 1935, followed by 25 and 1000 krona notes in 1957.

In 1961, the *Seðlabanki Íslands* became the central bank of Iceland and started issuing paper money, in denominations of 10, 25, 100, and 500 krona. They were manufactured in England by De la Rue.


## Second krona, 1981–present

In 1981, the Icelandic krona was revalued, due to high inflation, with 100 old krona (ISJ) being worth 1 new krona (ISK) and a new 500 krona banknote was first put into circulation in 1981. The 1000 krona was put into circulation in 1984 and the 5000 krona in 1986. The 2000 krona banknote was put into circulation in 1995 but never became very popular. The 10,000 krona banknote was put into circulation in 2013.

Coins of less than one krona have not circulated for many years. In September 2002, Davíð Oddsson, the Icelandic Prime Minister at the time, signed two regulations decreeing that all monetary amounts on invoices and financial claims should be stated and paid in whole krona only and that coins with a value of less than one krona should be withdrawn from circulation. In 2007, the eyrir formally ceased to exist as a subunit of the Icelandic króna.


### Coins

In 1981, coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 10 and 50 aurar *(cents)*, 1 krona and 5 krona. These were followed by 10 krona pieces in 1984, 50 krona in 1987 and 100 krona in 1995. Since 2003, Icelandic banks no longer accept any coins denominated in aurar *(cents)*.

### Banknotes

Icelandic banknotes are printed with the dates from which the legal basis of the currency derives. In 1981, notes were issued in denominations of 10, 50, 100 and 500 krona based on the law of 29 March 1961. 1000 krona notes were introduced in 1984, followed by 5000 krona notes in 1986 with the same law.

100, 500, and 1000 krona notes were reissued in 1994 under the law of 5 May 1986. In the following year, a new denomination of 2000 krona was issued for the first time. The 2000 krona note is subtly different from the other notes. For example, the underprint pattern extends all the way upward and downward, while the other denominations had white margins on every side. The number *2000* is printed in multi color for 3 of the 4 occurrences. And the numeral *2000* on the lower left corner of reverse is vertical. The "shadow" of the numeral is printed with SÍ in microprint.

The 22 May 2001 series, saw substantial changes. The underprint and microprint features of the 2000 krona note were extended to other denominations. The 1000 and 5000 krona notes also received metallic foils next to the portrait.

In 2013, a new 10000 krona banknote was introduced. The face of natural scientist and poet Jónas Hallgrímsson appears on the bill, as well as the Eurasian golden plover. Notes of 100 krona or less are no longer in circulation, as they have been withdrawn by the central bank.

## Issues affecting the Icelandic krona

Iceland is not a member of the European Union and does not use the euro.
The Icelandic currency is a low-volume world currency, strongly managed by its central bank. Its value in terms of other currencies has historically been swift to change, for example against the US and Canadian dollars, and the other Nordic currencies (Swedish krona, Norwegian krone, Danish krone), and the euro. For example, during the first half of 2006, the Icelandic krona ranged between 50 and 80 per US dollar. Prior to the currency's collapse in October 2008, the krona was considered overvalued.

In most shops electronic payment is accepted. Other currencies are very rarely accepted in Iceland. A notable exception is Keflavík International Airport (which has many transfer passengers), where the US dollar, euro and some other currencies are accepted by all merchants. Certain stores in central Reykjavík accept some foreign currencies.

Iceland's per capita computer usage is among the highest in the world, far higher than the UK or US. The saturation of technology in Iceland has had ramifications in the monetary system: a very high proportion of payments in Iceland are made electronically, e.g. by debit or credit cards or online bank transfers. The largest denomination banknote, the 10000 krona note ( €66.89/US$72.25 in August 2024 ), has a relatively low value; therefore, most of Iceland's high value trades are done in electronic transfers and in other currencies.


### 2008 financial crisis

In October 2008, the financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought about a collapse of the Icelandic banking sector. The value of the Icelandic krona dropped, and on 7 October 2008 the Icelandic Central Bank attempted to peg it at 131 against the euro. This peg was abandoned the next day. The krona later dropped again and to 340 against the euro before trade in the currency was suspended (by comparison, the rate at the start of 2008 was about 90 krona to the euro). After a period of tentative, very low-volume international trading in the krona, activity had been expected to pick up again throughout November 2008, albeit still with low liquidity, as Iceland secured an International Monetary Fund loan. However, as of January 2009 the krona was still not being traded regularly, with the European Central Bank (ECB) reference rate being set only intermittently, the last time on 3 December 2008 at 290 krona per euro.

The Icelandic krona similarly fell in value against the US dollar, from around 50 to 80 per dollar to about 110–115 per dollar; by mid-November 2008 it had continued to lower to 135 to the dollar. As of 2 April 2009, the value hovered around 119 per dollar, roughly maintaining that value over the next two years with 23 March 2011, prices around 114 per dollar. With this, the previously high costs for foreign traders and tourists dropped, which Iceland's trade and tourism industry undertook to exploit. In July 2008, a Big Mac cost the equivalent of nearly US$6, versus $3.57 in the US.


### Iceland and the euro

Theoretically, the adoption of the euro could have several advantages. Adopting what is perceived by some as a historically stronger currency might help Iceland to "avoid the turbulence surrounding speculations in international financial markets". In addition, Icelandic economists listed several arguments in favour of the euro before the crisis. "In terms of growth potentials and welfare, the euro could be expected to bring lower long-term interest rates [...]. This would of course increase capital investment and labour productivity. The euro might lower consumer prices by facilitating a comparison with other euro countries."
Because of the volatility between the euro and the krona, former Foreign Minister Valgerður Sverrisdóttir considered the idea that Iceland might dollarize itself into the Eurozone without joining the European Union.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Opinion regarding the euro is mixed among Icelanders. An opinion poll about Iceland joining the European Union released on 11 September 2007 showed that 53% of respondents were in favour of adopting the euro, 37% opposed and 10% undecided. Another poll produced for the Icelandic newspaper *Fréttablaðið* and released on 30 September 2007 showed 56% opposed to euro adoption and 44% in favour. In January 2008, a poll by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce put support for Iceland to abandon the krona for another currency at 63%. A number of companies in Iceland, such as Össur, have started to pay their employees in euros or US dollars, mainly due to the high inflation and high volatility.

The financial crisis prompted further calls for Iceland to join the Eurozone. In January 2009, one senior Icelandic official stated that due to the crisis "the krona is dead. We need a new currency. The only serious option is the euro." In March 2009, a report by Iceland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Össur Skarphédinsson, considered three options: retaining the krona, adopting the euro without joining the EU and adopting the euro through EU membership. The report recommended the third option.

An economic study of the impact of the adoption of the euro by Iceland found that the Icelandic krona acts both as a barrier and buffer to international trade, and that by joining the EU and adopting the euro, Icelandic international trade might be 60% higher.

In July 2009, the Alþingi (parliament) narrowly voted to apply for EU membership, but that application has been frozen since 2013 (see accession of Iceland to the European Union).

In March 2015, Icelandic authorities announced by letter to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union that Iceland should not be seen as candidate state, and that there were no specific plans to continue any membership process. Leaders of the ruling government parties have also stated that the krona will remain as Iceland's currency for at least the foreseeable future.


### Iceland and unilateral adoption of another currency

Some small countries, such as El Salvador, Ecuador and Montenegro, have unilaterally adopted the use of a more stable foreign currency as a means of controlling inflation. The cost of this is generally very high, as the adopting country loses all control over monetary policy, and all the benefits of seignorage. A currency board is a second tier solution, where the exchange rate of the currency is fixed to that of another country, or a "basket" of currencies.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

There was a discussion in 2012 about the feasibility of adopting a foreign currency. The idea of adopting the Canadian dollar was popular and the Canadian ambassador to Iceland stated that Iceland could adopt the currency if it so wished. Canada was favoured due to its northern geography and similar resource based economy, in addition to its relative economic stability.

Arnór Sighvatsson, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, at a meeting of the Icelandic Federation of Labour on 10 January 2012, said:

As of 2018ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Icelandic authorities had no plans to adopt a foreign currency.
