## History

NICE was founded in 1986 as Neptune Intelligence Computer Engineering (NICE) in Israel; later, on October 14, 1991, the Company was renamed NICE Systems Ltd with the acronym no longer in active use.

Much of the early technology developed by NICE was for contact centers, financial services and business intelligence markets. The computer engineers that founded NICE created a telephony voice recording system in the early 90s, followed by ATM software under the subsidiary, NICECom. The ATM vendor quickly grew its operations in the 90s and NICE sold its subsidiary to 3Com in 1994 for $54 million. In 2007, NICE acquired Actimize for $280 million. The company developed risk management software for various markets, identifying risks for its customers.

In 2011 NICE acquired UK-based Fizzback, with the value of the deal said to be $80 million. The UK company specialized in customer feedback, collecting real-time customer experience information. At the time of acquisition, Fizzback processed 150 million individual feedback reports; many of these reports taken in real-time from social media platforms. During the same year, NICE announced the acquisition of analytics firm, Merced Systems for $150 million. Merced was a provider of performance management services, offered predominantly as software as a service with additional analytics and workforce optimization.

On June 6, 2016, the Company was renamed NICE Ltd., which is its legal and commercial name. NICE acquired inContact for a reported $960 million allowing NICE to expand their customer services offering and integrate a cloud contact center, using a Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) approach. Paul Jarman of inContact would continue as CEO to lead the inContact division once integrated into NICE.

In 2018, NICE acquired The Mattersight Corporation that was founded as a behavioral analytics software company in 1994, before diversifying into cloud analytics and its SaaS offering. The agreed deal was $90 million, which made the total acquisition price 25% above share value and Mattersight's service offering was integrated into NICE.

In May 2019, NICE acquired Brand Embassy allow NICE to manage customer interactions across a greater number of platforms, including social media. According to BizJournals, this would include 30 additional channels, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and LinkedIn.

In April 2021, it was announced that NICE would be acquiring MindTouch, a San Diego–based knowledge management company. It was founded in 2005 it offered KM (knowledge management) to maximize customer lifetime value. NICE rebranded the platform as CXone Expert. Recently, NICE has been touted by the media as a potential benefactor to the growth of the AI and chatbot industries. In 2021, growth in numerous tech sectors led to NICE receiving a valuation of $17 billion, making it the most valuable company in Israel. During the same period, the company partnered with Google Cloud with the aim of creating a more effective customer service applications for traditional contact centers. At Interactions Live 2022, NICE demonstrated how brands can build frictionless customer experiences and how the Customer Experience Interactions (CXi) framework can assist the creation of these frictionless experiences.

In June 2024, it was announced that its CEO Barak Eilam would be stepping down from his role at the end of 2024. It marked the end of his 25 year career at NICE, having spent the past decade as its chief executive officer. Eilam would continue to be involved with NICE during the first half of 2025, serving in a strategic consulting role for the software company. Just over a month after the announcement of Eilam's departure, former SAP executive Scott Russell was announced as his replacement. Russell would begin is role as CEO effective January 1, 2025. In August, the company released its second-quarter figures which saw net profit for the quarter increase by 33% to $115.8 million.

During the same period, NICE announced its inaugural International Happiness Index 2024. It is a comprehensive study examining the gap between consumer expectations and what customer experience (CX) they receive. The study found that those using artificial intelligence in customer experience, had higher rates of satisfaction when compared to those using traditional methods. NICE updated CXOne MPower in late 2024, increasing its use of AI and automation. Following the news, it was described to be "well positioned" for growth in the CCaaS market.


## Products and services

NICE specializes in AI and customer experience software, or CX as it is often abbreviated to. After inContact became part of the company's product portfolio in 2016, it allowed the company to expand its contact center as a service (CCaaS) offering.


### CXone

CXone is part of NICE's product offering. In 2021, NICE surpassed $1 billion in cloud revenue. In March 2023, the platform reached the milestone of having one million users.

In early 2023, NICE announced the industry's first conversational CX with ChatGPT-enabled CXone. CX Network magazine stated the offering would be ideal for contact centres where customers were unable to wait for callbacks due to the nature of their inquiry. NICE also announced that CXone customers in Europe would now experience the first "EU Sovereign" CCaaS platform on the continent. After working with various regulatory bodies in the European Union, data centers, and also cloud providers, NICE delivered the first CX platform where all data passing through it would remain within the EU.

An additional CXone product was launched in 2024, CXone MPower. The product combines CXone with Copilot, Autopilot, and Actions tools. CX Today referred to MPower at the time of its launch as *“world’s first and only CX-aware AI platform.”* In September 2024, it was announced NICE was part of a $578 million mega deal to transform Services Australia, the southern hemisphere’s largest contact center. MPower received a significant update in October 2024, giving users automated customer service across the entire customer journey. The update also allowed the integration of workflows between front and back offices, while also consolidating AI and human agents as one.

NICE launched Enlighten Copilot, Enlighten Autopilot and Enlighten Actions at NICE's Interactions 2023 event. This was seen by some within the CX industry as the first generative AI solution for large enterprises.


### Livevox

On December 26, 2023, NICE finalized the acquisition of LiveVox Inc. This acquisition significantly expanded the feature set of NICE's CXone platform, particularly within the Outbound Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) market. LiveVox's offerings include notable products like Human Call Initiator (HCI), which facilitates semi-automated outbound call campaigns while ensuring adherence to U.S. regulations. Additionally, LiveVox offers capabilities like Human Text Intiator (HTI), the SMS counterpart to HCI. These solutions are very attractive to various industries, including debt collection, banking, healthcare, and sales.


## Media findings

In 2019, NICE released a study on internal business performance and how that effected customer experience, with the main finding that companies in Australia and the United States both over estimate the quality of their customer experience.

NICE’s 2022 Digital-First Customer Experience Report revealed that there are major gaps between what customers think about the support they receive and how seriously business leaders are taking their expectations.
