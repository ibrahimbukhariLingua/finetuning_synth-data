Gold Strike Resorts


# Gold Strike Resorts



**Gold Strike Resorts** was a family of gaming companies based in Jean, Nevada.


## History

The company's history can be traced to 1977, when David Belding, Michael Ensign, and William Richardson purchased the Gold Strike Hotel and Casino near Boulder City, Nevada. Belding and Richardson acquired their shareholdings from their fathers Don Belding, and Jack Richardson, while Ensign bought out third owner O.L. Raney's shareholding. Ensign was the father of Senator John Ensign and had connections to competitor Circus Circus Enterprises.

In 1994, Gold Strike announced a partnership with Mirage Resorts to build a $250-million casino targeted at budget-conscious visitors, on part of the site of the demolished Dunes golf course on the Las Vegas Strip. It ultimately opened in 1996, following the merger, as the Monte Carlo.

Gold Strike Resorts was acquired in 1995 by Circus Circus Enterprises for $450 million in cash and stock. The acquisition did not include the original Gold Strike near Boulder City, because the owners wanted to pass it on to their children.
