### Stroymontazh

In 1994, Artur Kirilenko along with Sergei Polonsky founded construction company Stroymontazh in St. Petersburg and remained its owner and CEO between 1994 and 2010.

In 2000, Stroymontazh corporation opened a branch in Moscow, which had been headed by Sergei Polonsky. Artur Kirilenko remained a head of the St. Petersburg business of the group. In 2002, Polonsky and Kirilenko divided up the business and in 2004 Polonsky created Mirax Group on the basis of the Moscow branch end exited the St. Petersburg business of Stroymontazh: after dividing up the business Artur Kirilenko became a sole owner of Stroymontazh.

By 2008, Stroymontazh controlled about 10% of the construction market in St Petersburg in the residential sector. In 2008, the company delivered 286,000 square metres of residential property and its sales revenue exceeded 5.5 billion roubles (€150 million). Since inception the company built over 800,000 square metres of residential and 60,000 square metres of commercial property.

The company suffered considerable losses as a result of the financial crisis of 2008-2010 and a corporate conflict with one of its creditors *Baltisky Bank*, which was subsequently bailed out by Alfa-Bank. in 2010 Stroymontazh went into administration and in July 2015 the company was liquidated.


### Hermitage

In 2003, Stroymontazh corporation established a French subsidiary named Stroimotage de Paris and subsequently renamed Hermitage. Emin Iskenderov has become the head of the French operations.

In 2006, Hermitage began construction of its first project Les Allees de l’Hermitage, which was successfully completed in 2008 and was named the best residential development in Ile-de-France.

This was followed by such projects as:

Avant-Seine for 300 apartments, completed in 2009;

Domaine du Lac for 1000 apartments, completed in 2009;

The development project will see the construction of two skyscrapers of 86 stories and 320 meters tall, which by 2024 will become the tallest building in Western Europe.


## Disputes and litigation

At the height of the Great Recession in 2008, as the construction sector experienced severe liquidity shortage, *Baltisky Bank*, one of Stroymontazh's creditors, initiated a series of court suits aimed at acquiring the debtor's assets at distressed value. Artur Kirilenko acted as a guarantor for the loans and *Baltisky Bank* also sued him personally for 1.2 billion rubles (€33 million). Apart from this, *Baltisky Bank* also initiated a criminal investigation, which was eventually dropped as the inquiry found no instances of criminal conduct or wrongdoing in Kirilenko’s actions. No signs of premeditated bankruptcy were found in the actions by Stroymontazh's management. Transactions involving Stroymontazh's assets were pronounced fair and justified and all proceeds were used for completion of the project construction.

In February 2015, the Petrograd district court of St. Petersburg validated the settlement agreement between the subsidiaries of Baltisky Bank and Artur Kirilenko as guarantor of Stroymontazh. Later, *Baltisky Bank* experienced a shareholder conflict, which resulted in it being bailed out by Alfa-Bank and criminal charges being pressed upon its former shareholder and chairman Oleg Shigaev, the initiator of Stroymontazh’s bankruptcy. Oleg Shigaev was subsequently put on a wanted list and charged with fraud and money laundering.
