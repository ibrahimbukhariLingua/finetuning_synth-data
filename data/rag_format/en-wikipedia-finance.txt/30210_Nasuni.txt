# Nasuni



**Nasuni Corporation** is a privately-held hybrid cloud storage company with headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts.


## History

Nasuni was founded in 2009, and has raised approximately $169M, with the last funding a $25M investment in which all previous investors participated, including Goldman Sachs, Telstra Ventures, and Northbridge Venture Partners.

In the time since Nasuni requested a patent on UniFS in November 2013, the company has expanded its access to cloud storage infrastructure, as well as its on-premises edge appliance offerings, which provide local access to content stored in Nasuni-managed cloud storage.

On 14 July 2020, Nasuni Corp. collected $25 million in a new round of funding, plus an additional $15 million debt facility, and upgraded its cloud file storage platform to support remote workers.

In May 2022, Nasuni acquired the technology assets of DBM Cloud Systems in order to provide enhanced data migration and cloud portability features.

In June of 2022, Nasuni acquired Storage Made Easy, a file data management company, for an undisclosed sum.

In July 2024, Nasuni announced a strategic growth investment led by Vista Equity Partners, a global investment firm focused exclusively on enterprise software, data, and technology-enabled businesses. Vista was joined by TCV and KKR in the new investment, which valued Nasuni at approximately $1.2 billion.


## Technology

The firm's storage software uses object storage, file caching appliances, and the company's proprietary UniFS global file system to offer a cloud solution that replaces traditional file servers and Network Attached Storage (NAS). Nasuni integrates with public cloud storage platforms, such as Google Cloud Storage, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure, and private cloud storage platforms such as IBM Cloud Object Storage and EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Such storage platforms provide an object-based storage infrastructure, on top of which UniFS creates a complete versioned file system. The Nasuni platform stores customer data as a sequence of snapshots that include every version of every file. The firm has demonstrated the ability to store more than one billion objects in a single storage volume.

Nasuni Edge Appliances run in the public cloud or on-premises to provide shared access to cached copies of active files. These Appliances are typically deployed as virtual machines, running on existing infrastructure, including VMware, Nutanix hyper-converged infrastructure, and Microsoft Hyper-V. The Edge Appliances can also run in the cloud on Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, or Google Cloud Platform. Hardware appliance choices offered by Nasuni include systems with solid-state drives.
