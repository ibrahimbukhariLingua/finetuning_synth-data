## History

The Dodsal Group was founded in Mumbai, India, in 1948 by the Nandlal Kilachand family as a trading company in partnership with a British trading company (DODWEL) and Karsa Salem. After the Kilachand family acquired Dodsal from the other partners and Rajen Kilachand took over the company, he streamlined Dodsal's various businesses to form the Dodsal Group. The group moved its headquarters from Mumbai to Dubai in 2003.

Dodsal Group and Atomenergomash (AEM), a Russian heavy equipment engineering company, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to cooperate in manufacturing and supplying power equipment for nuclear, thermal, and oil and gas projects in India. An initial investment in the range of US$150 million was put forth, targeting the start-up of commercial production by the first quarter of 2013.

Dodsal Group acquired the Chennai-based company AE&E I.D.E.A. (India) Private Limited on 7 March 2011.
