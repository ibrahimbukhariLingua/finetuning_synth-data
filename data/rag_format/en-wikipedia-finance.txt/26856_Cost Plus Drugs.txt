Cost Plus Drugs


# Cost Plus Drugs



**Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company** (**MCCPDC**), doing business as **Cost Plus Drugs**, is an American public benefit corporation, founded in 2022 with its main headquarters located in Dallas, Texas. The company is focused on the pharmacy distribution of drugs with a stated goal to lower the prices for generic drugs by removing middlemen, such as pharmacy benefit managers and by moving to a cost-plus pricing strategy.


## Origins and concept

Cost Plus Drugs was launched in January 2022. It was co-founded by radiologist Alex Oshmyansky and billionaire Mark Cuban. According to Cuban, in 2018, Oshmyansky contacted Cuban with an email titled "cold pitch" in which he asked Cuban to invest in a pharmacy he envisioned to manufacture generic drugs and skip the middleman wholesalers. The company has said that the intermediary layer of the pharmacy benefit managers is typically responsible for the heavy markup that drugs see between the manufacturers and the customers. The company uses Truepill Pharmacy's accredited pharmacists to fill prescriptions. Prices are direct to consumer, without any need or role for insurance.


## Operations

Oshmyansky is the founder and CEO. As of February 2022, the company was in the process of constructing a 22,000-square-foot (2,000 m²) factory in Deep Ellum, Dallas, for the purpose of manufacturing drugs in-house, which is scheduled to open in the 4th Quarter of 2022.

As of June 2022, the company had a selection of over 100 generic drugs, and by March 2023, over 350 drugs were available. In December 2023, the company had over 2200 drugs available. The drugs are sold for a price equivalent to the company's cost plus 15% markup, a $5 pharmacy service fee, and a $5 shipping fee. The company ships to all 50 US States.
