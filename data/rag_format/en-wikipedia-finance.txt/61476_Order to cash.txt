Order to cash


# Order to cash



**Order to cash** (**OTC** or **O2C**) normally refers to one of the top-level (context level) business processes for receiving and processing customer orders and revenue recognition. Order to cash is an essential function in finance; the entire cycle of events happens after a customer places an order until the customer pays for the order; that is, the order is converted to cash.

Beginning in the mid 2000s as more mid-size and large firms began to adopt enterprise systems, the science of business processes, manufacturing processes, and finance began to develop and proliferate to more industries and companies. Business process reengineering became more common, and enterprise architectures and IT solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ were aligned. Hence, the jargon of many other "top-level business processes" became more common.

These include:

Later, the concept of order-to-cash has been extended to "Lead to Cash" by many software providers to include also the marketing and pre-sales process steps.

In many business models, a contractual relationship is established first via a Contract or Subscription. Orders are then received via different sales channels, such as phone, fax, email, internet or salesperson. The contractual relationship is confirmed, and the orders are fulfilled through shipping and logistics. On completion of key events, an invoice is generated and booked as Sales (subject to "revenue recognition" requirements). If payment has not already been received, the debt is recorded and pursued through dunning cycles until the funds are received. Order to Cash is completed by the customer care and Field Service and Repair process (inquiries, requests and complaints).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
