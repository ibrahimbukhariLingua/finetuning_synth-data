## History

Cortera was founded in 1993 as SRR Solutions by Northeastern University professor, Venkat Srinivasan, to provide credit & collections software. Over the years, the company raised tens of millions in venture capital funding, dabbled with the creation of an online B2B debt exchange and changed its name to eCredit in 1998. In December 2006 the company was acquired by an investment group that ultimately included Fidelity Ventures, Battery Ventures, and CIBC. The company name was changed from eCredit to Cortera in early 2008.
