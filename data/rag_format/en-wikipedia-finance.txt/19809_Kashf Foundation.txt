## History


### Background

In 1993, Zafar, an Ashoka Fellow, was a Development economics student at Yale, where she came to know about the pioneer of microcredit and microfinance sector, Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and abandoned her plans to become an investment banker. Despite this she joined World Bank in Islamabad in the Water supply and sanitation department, where she attended a meeting about women and children in Islamabad sponsored by UNICEF and met Dr. Yunus and briefly talked about this work. During her fieldwork trip to Tharparkar, she noticed that the desire of women's who wanted to work and generate income for their families. She decided to work for their sustainability and quit her job at World Bank and wrote to Dr. Yunus about her intentions, who flew her to Bangladesh where she spent ten-weeks at Grameen Foundation, attending workshops, sessions, trainings, visiting branches of Grameen Bank and studying their business model, and researching from the clients of foundation. Zafar traveled for a year touring Nepal and India understanding the structure of low-income households and was given $10,000 loan from Dr. Yunus to start her own organization. There with the help of Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires (INSEAD) summer interns, she developed feasibility and business plan for women's businesses and female entrepreneurship in Pakistan.


### Foundation

After an extensive preliminary work in 1995, Zafar registered, Kashf as a "research" based program in Lahore, in June 1996, with a total staff of five women, with Zafar working as a loan officer. It took six-month for the Foundation, before anyone would borrow the money and by November 1996 it had distributed 15 loans, all of whom were women, who also became associated with the Kashf. According to Roshaneh, it was a "trust building" period. After the initial rounding Kashf, started training women through numeracy training and made the process of loan easier. The first amount of loans given were 4,000 PKR (roughly $80).

The initial two years were spent in understanding the market and the needs of clients in peri-urban and urban settings. The importance of standardized products, systems and policies, the simplification of procedures and reporting requirements, along with the significance of focusing on client satisfaction and developing clear cut financial performance indicators was highlighted. The action research phase was followed by a more focused approach to manage growth in the years 1999 – 2001. The following years were focused on growth of organization, with the main aspect of this phase was to make the branch structure leaner and more efficient; an aspect which was critical for ensuring the long term viability of the programme, along with setting up a cash flow model which would ensure the sustainability of a branch within a set time period. By early 2001, Kashf had a network of five branches in Lahore and a client base of 5,088 customers located in 214 centers. Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, Department for International Development, and the Agha Khan Foundation provided core funding.

Years, 2001-2004 saw the enhance outreach and deepen product offerings through cost effective and sustainable Kashf branches. Growing with quality was emphasized, adequate controls were established and the collection system was revamped. Kashf followed a lateral growth path by entering new markets and managing dispersed units. Kashf managed growth by widening outreach and deepening access by pioneering new products like micro-insurance. By end 2004, Kashf was providing financial services to over 68,000 clients through a network of 30 branches. As of April 2007, Kashf have 94 branches, 182,000 clients and operate in 12 different districts in two provinces of Pakistan.

In 2018, Kashf signed a $5 million loan by PROPARCO of French Development Agency (AFD) for its "commitment to financial inclusion and women empowerment in developing and emerging countries."


### Etymology

Kashf originates from Arabic word (Arabic: كشف), which translates as "unveiling" - Sufi concept rooted in Gnostic ideals dealing with knowledge of the heart rather than of the intellect. On naming the foundation Zafar explained, "I believe some things can get pre-ordained. One of most famous Sufi philosophers is buried here in Lahore. Kashf is a Sufi word, which means miracle or revelation or self-actualization. It’s a belief that God is within you, God is in humanity. Any individual can be a good individual. When I was in Bangladesh [with Grameen], the word 'Kashf' came to me."


### Loans

Due to the economic downturn, Kashf only provides income-generating loans. Apart from that Kashf had granted the business ‘surmaya’ loan to the Kashf Microfinance Bank, small entrepreneurship loans above US$1,000 have been given. However, the purpose of the bank was to focus on job creation as 65% of the Pakistani population is below 25 years of age. About 2 to 3% loans are rejected. If people are late with three or four payments, they will be rejected the next time they ask for a loan. In cases of emergencies Foundation, we reschedule the loan to sustain the family. Kashf focuses product design, frequent small paybacks, and group dynamics in order to make micro-according financing successful, according to organization, "It’s important for clients to pay back their loans in regular and small amounts on a monthly basis."


## Mission
