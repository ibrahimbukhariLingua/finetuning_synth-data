## History

ServiceMaster was founded in 1929 by Marion E. Wade, a minor league baseball player, as a moth-proofing company in Chicago, Illinois. It was incorporated in 1947 and expanded to franchised carpet cleaning in 1952. Its movement into business services makes it a large outsourcing company.

In the 1980s, the company acquired several branch and franchise-based service companies, including Terminix, TruGreen (1991), Merry Maids (1988), and American Home Shield (1989).

A group of equity sponsors led by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R) acquired ServiceMaster in July 2007 and took the company private.

In 2011, Hank Mullany, former executive vice president of Walmart U.S. and president of northern U.S. Walmart, was appointed as CEO for all ServiceMaster brands. Robert J. Gillette was appointed chief executive officer in June 2013.

As of January 1, 2014, TruGreen is no longer a brand of ServiceMaster, having instead become a separate privately held company.

ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc., then the parent of ServiceMaster Brands, announced on June 25, 2014, that it had priced an initial public offering of 35,900,000 shares of common stock at $17.00 per share. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 25, 2014, under the ticker symbol SERV. The company continues to be majority-owned by private equity firms Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, StepStone Group and Ridgemont Equity Partners, and JPMorgan Chase Funding.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Nikhil Varty was appointed chief executive officer in July 2017. Varty stepped down in 2020.

On July 26, 2017, ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc. announced a plan to spin off its American Home Shield business from its Terminix and Franchise Services Group into a separate publicly-traded company.

In 2020, Naren Gursahaney was appointed as chief executive officer, later that year, Roark Capital Group purchased ServiceMaster Brands.

In August 2021, ServiceMaster Brands purchased Two Men and a Truck, a family-owned moving franchise. As part of the sale, ServiceMaster Brands agreed to make charitable contributions to the nonprofits supported by Two Men and a Truck over the years.

In April 2022, ServiceMaster Brands purchased Aftermath Services, a privately owned trauma & biohazard cleanup company.
