## History

The history of the company dates to 1909, when the chemist S.W. Flesheim founded Master Builders Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio. He aimed to offer products for the construction industry. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, buildings for sports, art and alternative forms of social contact became important gathering places for many people. Master Builders played a role in this era by advancing concrete technology with the introduction of the first commercial water-reducing admixture in 1931, **Pozzolith** (sodium lignosulfonate). This innovation improved the quality and durability of concrete construction and reflected a shift in the industry. Pozzolith was also used in the construction of the famous Hoover Dam in 1932.

The success of Master Builders caught the attention of the American-Marietta Co. and led to the acquisition of the company in 1950. The acquisition was a strategic approach to expanding the company's own building materials portfolio. The company invested around 10 million dollars in a new technology center in Beachwood, Ohio, in 1977, which focused on concrete analysis and testing.

During the 1980s, the construction chemicals business underwent various transitions. In 2006, the chemical company BASF AG acquired the construction chemicals business including production sites and distribution centers in over 50 countries as well as the current global research and development center in Trostberg, Germany. In 2013, the umbrella brand Master Builders Solutions was introduced, consolidating all existing brands within the division. BASF announced the divestiture of its construction chemicals division to private equity firm Lone Star Funds in 2020 under the name MBCC Group. The Swiss chemicals group Sika bought the MBCC Group. Sika then sold the core sector of MBCC’s chemicals business with concrete admixtures, cement additives, and solutions for underground construction to the international private equity firm Cinven as of May 3, 2023.


## Research and development

The company's research and development initiatives focus on advancements in construction chemistry. With over 300 experts worldwide, spread across 3 R&D centers and numerous local laboratories, the focus is on developing responsible solutions that enhance concrete performance and contribute to CO₂ emission reduction. In 2023, the Master Builders Solutions Holding allocated over 3% of its turnover to R&D, resulting in over 80 ongoing pipeline projects.

One notable innovation is the superplasticizer **MasterCO₂re**, facilitating the use of clinker-reduced cement types in concrete production and achieving substantial CO₂ savings up to 50%.
