Group 1 purchased the Brazilian automotive dealership group UAB Motors Participacoes S.A. in 2013 and operated as Group 1 Automotive Brazil.

## Products and services

In response to used vehicle retailing trends, the Val-U-Line brand was launched in 2018 to offer enhanced benefits for consumers purchasing older, higher mileage vehicles such as a three-day/300 mile return policy and Carfax vehicle history reports. Initial investment impacted forecasts but future earnings were positive, contributing to a 13.9% increase in used vehicle sales for 2018.

In 2019, the company created AcceleRide, a digital retailing platform allowing customers to purchase, sell, or arrange service for vehicles online. The platform also provides vehicle financing, trade-in appraisals, and offsite delivery options.


## Philanthropy

With individual dealerships engage in local philanthropic efforts often independent from the corporate office, Group 1 supports Houston-area causes focusing on community outreach and grade school education. Employees regularly make brown bag lunches to support Kids' Meals and donated cargo vans for their Meals on Wheels deliveries.

The company is partnered with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society as the official vehicle sponsor of the Texas MS 150; SEARCH Homeless Services; and Junior Achievement of South East Texas for events, classroom mentoring, and the JA Company Program in Spring Branch ISD. Starting in November 2017, Group 1 partnered with the Houston Independent School District to reward their Teacher of the Month recipients with a new vehicle to drive for the month.


### The Group 1 Foundation

The Group 1 Foundation was initially created to support employees impacted by Hurricane Katrina, closely followed by Hurricane Rita. This tax-exempt charity gives all proceeds to help fellow employees in times of hardship. Examples include supporting survivors of fatal car accidents and a fire at an employee's home.

Subsequent natural disasters like the 2013 Moore tornado, Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Harvey, and Hurricane Michael also marked the need for the Group 1 Foundation to assist their employees.
