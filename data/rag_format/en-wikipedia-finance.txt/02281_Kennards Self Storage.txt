## History

In 1973, Kennards Hire established Australia's first self storage facility at the rear of its Moorebank, Sydney branch. Initially branded as Kennards Mini Storage it was renamed Easi-Stor in 1979.

In 1981 a derelict wool store building in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane was purchased and redeveloped as Queensland’s first self storage centre. Nine further properties were subsequently purchased in Sydney, Newcastle and Brisbane during the 1980s.

In 1991, the Kennard family, decided to split the business, with Neville Kennard taking the self storage business. At the same time it was renamed Kennards Self Storage. A further 14 storage centres opened in the 1990s including the first in Victoria.

Sam Kennard was appointed CEO in 1994, taking over from Neville.

In the early 2000’s the first of 20 wine storage locations opened.

In 2004, 24 self storage properties were added in the $220M acquisition of Millers Self Storage. This was completed in a 50:50 joint venture with Valad Property Group.

In 2007 eight facilities were purchased in New Zealand. In June 2008, Kennards agreed to buy-out the Valad Property Group shareholding in the joint venture.

By 2025, 112 facilities were operating across Australia and New Zealand.
