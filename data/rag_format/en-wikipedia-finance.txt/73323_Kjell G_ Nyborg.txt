His book *Collateral Frameworks: The Open Secret of Central Banks* on Cambridge University Press (2017) lays bare the "hidden" workings and practices of central banks.

## Collateral Frameworks

Nyborg's latest research focuses on the role of money in financial markets and on central bank collateral frameworks which lie at the foundation of modern monetary and financial systems. He argues that "money matters" and quoting Walter Bagehot "money is economical power" states that "[t]he money at the core of modern economies is central bank money, what bankers call ‘liquidity’. Central banks inject money into the economy, using banks as intermediaries, against collateral. So, if money is economic power and money is issued against collateral, it is important to understand the nature of this collateral, and the terms of the exchange."

He shows that central banks' size and importance increased substantially in the last decade and if one wants to understand how financial systems work one has to look closely into what central banks are doing. Nyborg's broader agenda is to investigate the role of money in finance. Modern macroeconomics and finance often ignore money, it is rarely modeled explicitly in the theory of banking and finance. However, Nyborg argues that money and its architecture matter and are critical for understanding financial markets and the broader economy.

Taking the Eurozone as an example, Nyborg shows that the Eurosystem's collateral framework promotes illiquid and risky collateral and that it impairs market forces and discipline. In their place, we find rating agencies, government guarantees, and political forces. He argues that "[w]ell-functioning monetary and financial systems are important to the efficient flow of resources and private and social welfare. ... Widespread financial market interventions by central banks have made it difficult to gauge “correct” market prices... This undermines the efficient allocation of resources in the economy. Improving our understanding of the workings of the monetary and financial system is therefore of central, and also urgent, importance. ... Transparency is also important vis-à-vis the public at large." ... Nyborg's work on collateral frameworks has opened up the workings of central banks and how they manage and control capital markets and the economy through their collateral policies.
