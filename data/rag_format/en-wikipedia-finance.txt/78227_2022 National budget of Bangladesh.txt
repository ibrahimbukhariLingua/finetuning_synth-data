## History

The National Budget is the annual financial statement of Bangladesh; an estimate of income and expenditure of the government of Bangladesh on a periodical basis. Under Article 87.(1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh, it is a compulsory task of the government. Upon achieving independence, the first budget of Bangladesh was presented by Tajuddin Ahmad in 1972 and totaled ৳786 crore (US$67 million). This was the 51st national budget of Bangladesh. Former ministers of finance AMA Muhith and Saifur Rahman presented 12 budgets each for their respective governments, the highest number in Bangladesh's history. The 2022 budget was the 51st in the nation's history and the 23rd budget to be presented by an Awami League-led government.
