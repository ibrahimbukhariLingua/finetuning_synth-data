## History

The construction of the shopping center began in 2014. In 2016, the first and second stages of the center were commissioned, with a total area of 112,000 m²; the third sector was opened in 2017. The Investments in the project amounted to 5 billion rubles.

As of April 2022, only one corps of the retail center was in operation, and even in this corps there were many empty pavilions.
