**Shenzhen Yinwang Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd**, (Chinese: 深圳引望智能技术有限公司) or trade as "**Yinwang**" is a company of Huawei which specialized in providing parts and hardware and software solutions for automotive manufacturers. The company was formerly known as **Huawei Intelligent Automotive Solution** (HIAS, Chinese: 华为智能汽车解决方案), the automobile business unit of Huawei.


## History

In April 2019 at the Shanghai Auto Show, Huawei officially announced the establishment of **Huawei Intelligent Automotive Solution,** Huawei's business for the automotive industry. According to Huawei, the purpose of establishing the business unit is to sell auto parts and technical solutions to vehicle manufacturers.

In January 2024, Huawei decided to operate the business unit independently and established the fully-owned subsidiary, the **Shenzhen Yinwang Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd**, with a registered initial capital of 1 billion RMB.

In April 2024 during an event ahead of the Beijing auto show, Jin Yuzhi, CEO of Huawei's Intelligent Automotive Solution (IAS) business unit, announced its first brand, Qiankun (乾崑), to provide self-driving systems involving the driving chassis, audio and driver's seat for auto makers.

In August 2024, Avatr Technology and Seres Group announced that they would invest in Huawei's subsidiary "Yinwang" (Shenzhen Yinwang Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd.), accounting for 10% of the shares respectively, with a price of RMB 11.5 billion. With the announcement of the transaction, Yinwang's market valuation reached 115 billion RMB.


## Operation

Huawei's partnership with automobile manufacturers has taken the form of three modes, the standardized parts supply mode, the "Huawei Inside" (HI) mode, and the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA).

### Tier 2 — Huawei Inside (HI)

Huawei provide full-stack smart car solution and Huawei's smart cockpit to car manufacturers. In this mode, Huawei empowers vehicle intelligence through the supply of both software and hardware, but does not participate in the design, development, and marketing of the vehicles. Arcfox, Avatr and Voyah are currently adopting this model.

In March 2024, Yu Chendong, the CEO of Huawei Intelligent Automotive Solution, revealed that Deepal, M-Hero and Voyah would apply the "Huawei Inside" mode for several of their new models. However, in August 2024 when Changan and Dongfeng released the Deepal S07 and Voyah Dreamer which equipped with Huawei's technology solutions, they marketed as "Qiankun Smart Driving" or "Harmony Cockpit" instead of badging with "Huawei Inside" logo.

In August 2024, with Avatr becoming the first company to invest in Yinwang, the previous "Huawei Inside" (HI) model has been further upgraded to a new "HI Plus" model, enabling Huawei to get more deeply involved in Avatr's product definition. Dongfeng's M-Hero and Voyah would also applied this upgraded mode.

In November 2024, Dongfeng Nissan and Huawei signed an agreement of cooperation that they would develop the vehicle based on Huawei's Harmony Cockpit under the Huawei Inside (HI) mode. It is the first sino-foreign joint venture to collaborate with Huawei.
