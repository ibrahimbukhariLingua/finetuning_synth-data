## History

In 1915, Hungarian immigrants Ernest and Edmund Horwath founded Horwath & Horwath in New York. The original practice focused on the hospitality industry. The practice later expanded to include accounting, audit and tax offerings. In 1967, it merged with Laventhol Krekstein Griffith & Co. to become Laventhol & Horwath.

Crowe Chizek was established in 1942 in South Bend, Indiana, by Fred P. Crowe Sr. and Cletus F. Chizek. Previously, Crowe had worked in public accounting for many years and also served as the St. Joseph County auditor for eight years. Chizek was head of the accounting department at the University of Notre Dame and also worked part-time in public accounting. Following the death of Fred P. Crowe Sr. in 1952, Cletus F. Chizek reorganized the firm as Crowe, Chizek and Company and two firm personnel, M. Mendel Piser and Fred P. Crowe Jr., became partners. The first legal partnership of Crowe Chizek and Company was formulated in 1962 with six founding partners: Cletus F. Chizek, M. Mendel Piser, Fred P. Crowe Jr., Robert W. Green, Joseph A. Bauters and John J. Pairitz.

By 1960, the umbrella organization Horwath & Horwath International Associates (HHIA) was established.

In 1989, the organization shortened its name to Horwath International and in 1991 Crowe Chizek became a member of the network.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
