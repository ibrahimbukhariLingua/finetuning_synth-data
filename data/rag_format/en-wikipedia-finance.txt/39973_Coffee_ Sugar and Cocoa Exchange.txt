Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange


# Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange



The **Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange** (CSCE) was founded in 1882 as the **Coffee Exchange in the City of New York**. Sugar futures were added in 1914, and, on September 28, 1979, the **New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange** merged with the New York Cocoa Exchange (which in turn had been founded in 1925) to form CSCE. In 1998, CSCE merged with the New York Cotton Exchange as subsidiaries of the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT). The CSCE operates as an independent unit of NYBOT trading futures and options on coffee, sugar and cocoa and the S&P Commodity Index. Trading is by open outcry, from 8 a.m. to 2:45Â p.m., Monday through Friday. In January 2007, NYBOT merged with IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE.
