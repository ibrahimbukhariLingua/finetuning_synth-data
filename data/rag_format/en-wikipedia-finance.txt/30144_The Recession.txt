The Recession has a score of 72 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews". *The Phoenix* gave it all four stars and said that "Elsewhere we get lots of the usual earthquake bass and keening synth arpeggios and staccato horns, and, of course, Jeezy’s hypnotically commanding flow, all of it amounting to one of the hardest mainstream rap albums in years." *The Guardian* gave it four stars out of five and said that "The album touches upon economic issues without dwelling on them, and it captures the spirit of the times with an unerring precision." *Slant Magazine* also gave it four stars out of five and said, "There's a unique pleasure in hearing a once one-dimensional rapper discover complexity, and for that Recession is nearly indispensable." *Billboard* gave it a favorable review and stated, "Young Jeezy balances commercial/ pop aspirations with core hip-hop sounds on The Recession, getting a lift from DJ Toomp, Drumma Boy, Midnight Black and longtime collaborator Shawty Redd on this sonically enjoyable follow-up to 2006's 'The Inspiration'." *The Village Voice* also gave it a favorable review and said that Jeezy's previous two albums "were well-crafted, uncompromising in their focus, and exceptionally entertaining. *The Recession* makes it three."

AllHipHop gave it a score of seven-and-a-half stars out of ten and said, "Overcoming shaky moments in the album's early half, Jeezy again sets himself apart from his Trap music peers. But this time he combines a serious social theme with his usual content to make that distinction. And while there's no doubt that America is currently in an economic decline, in 2008 that same claim cannot be made about Young Jeezy." *The A.V. Club* gave it a B and called it "silly, repetitive, and wildly unoriginal. Yet thanks to Jeezy's razor-blade rasp and goofy charisma, it's also strangely infectious." *Blender* gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that "If *Recession*-era Jeezy sounds a lot like boom-time Jeezy--describing coke cooking and the cars one gets in reward—that’s because he has always fancied himself an educator, a Learning Annex lecturer, an inspirational-desktop-calendar hustler."

Other reviews are average, mixed or negative: *Hartford Courant* gave the album an average review and said it was "largely a faithful rehash of his first two platters, which transformed him from unrepentant hustler to unlikely inspirational figure." *Paste* gave it a 5.8 out of ten and said that the singles "are exceptional, but the filler suffers from a detached and dispirited sound." *Prefix Magazine* gave it a 4.5 out of ten and said of Jeezy, "Putting out an album called *The Recession* right now, and draping the American flag over your head on its cover, comes with expectations of politically conscious ruminations. Instead, we get more of the same."
