### FCA vs Fabiana Abdel-Malek & Walid Choucair trial

Fiyaz was mentioned during the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) vs Fabiana Abdel-Malek and Walid Choucair insider dealing trial that took place in 2018 and 2019. Abdel-Malek was employed as a senior compliance officer by the investment bank UBS AG in their London office and used her position to identify inside information which she passed to her family friend Choucair, an experienced day trader of financial securities, using pay-as-you-go mobile telephones. The pair were sentenced to 3 years imprisonment each.

During the trial, Walid Choucair alleged in his testimony that he obtained trading tips from several traders he knew including Alshair Fiyaz and not from Fabiana Abdel-Malek. In his ruling, Lord Justice Nigel Davis of the Criminal Court of Appeal said of the defendants: "The jury, having evaluated their evidence, did not believe them. The jury were made sure, on all the evidence, that the counts of insider trading on the indictment had been proved". Fabiana Abdel-Malek and Walid Choucair lodged an application to the Court of Appeal in 2020, which was rejected due to insufficient grounds. Their convictions were upheld.
