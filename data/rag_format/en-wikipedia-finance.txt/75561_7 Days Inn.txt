# 7 Days Inn



**7 Days Group Holdings Limited**, operating as **7 Days Inn** (Chinese: 7天酒店; pinyin: *Qītiān Jiǔdiàn*; Jyutping: *Cat1tin1 Zau2dim3*), is a Chinese budget hotel chain. It was established in 2005. It has its headquarters in the Creative Industry Zone in Haizhu District, Guangzhou.


## History

7 Days Inn was established in 2005. Guangzhou was the location of the company's founding.

In 2006, Warburg Pincus invested US$10 million. In 2007, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, and Warburg Pincus further invested a combined total of US$95 million. In 2008, Actis Capital led a US$65 million investment in 7 Days Inn, in which Warburg Pincus again participated. Despite losses amounting to ¥209.9 million (US$30.8 million) in 2008 and ¥9.3 million (US$1.4 million) in the first three quarters of 2009, it listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2009, issuing 10.1 million American Depositary Shares (representing 20.6% of the company) at US$11/share, raising a total of $111.1 million. CEO Zhang retained a 13.4% stake. 7 Days Inns' failure to turn a profit up to that point meant they were unable to make an offering of A shares in China.

In July 2013, the founders of 7 Days Inn, Mr. Boquan He, Mr. Nanyan Zheng, Mr. Chien Lee, Ms. Qiong Zhang together with Carlyle Group and Sequoia Capital took 7 Days Inn private for US$688 million and 7 Days Inn became the Plateno Hotels Group; this meant 7 Days Inn was no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2015 Jinjiang Hotels bought 81% of Keystone Lodging, the holding company of Plateno Hotels, now the parent company of 7 Days Inn, for 8.3 billion renminbi (US$1.3 billion), which meant it now controlled 7 Days Inn.
