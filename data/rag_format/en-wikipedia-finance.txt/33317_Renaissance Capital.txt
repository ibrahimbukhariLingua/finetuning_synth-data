## History

Renaissance Capital was established in 1995 by a group of founding partners, including Stephen Jennings, Boris Jordan, Leonid Rozhetskin, Anton Kudryashov and Richard Deitz.

Since 2004, Oleg Zhelezko, at the invitation of Stephen Jennings, took control of the direction of trading in derivative securities in the Renaissance Capital investment bank

On September 22, 2008, ONEXIM Group and Renaissance entered into a strategic partnership whereby ONEXIM Group purchased a 50% (minus one share) stake in Renaissance Capital for $500 million following the issuance of new equity, commenting that the acquisition “presents the opportunity to take Renaissance Capital to the next level”.

In 2010, Renaissance Capital paid 207 million rand ($27 million) to acquire Barnard Jacobs Mellet Securities Ltd., the South African stock brokerage.

In November 2012, ONEXIM Group acquired further stakes in Renaissance Capital which resulted a full ownership of the investment bank and indirect ownership of an 89% stake in the consumer finance bank Renaissance Credit.
Commenting on the deal, Dmitry Razumov, chief executive officer of ONEXIM Group, said “We strongly believe in the strategy of Renaissance Capital and that the financial resources of ONEXIM will only strengthen the unique position of the bank in the markets in which it operates.”
The transaction was completed in April 2013, following the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.
