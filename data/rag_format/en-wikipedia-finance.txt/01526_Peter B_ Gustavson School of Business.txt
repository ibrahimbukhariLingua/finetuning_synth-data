## Programs

The Gustavson School of Business offers the following programs:


### Bachelor of Commerce (BCom)

Gustavson has a "2+2" program structure, meaning students take pre-commerce coursework and a number of required courses in the first two years of their degree. Required courses in these first 2 years include "Microeconomics", "Finite Mathematics", "Academic Reading & Writing", "Statistics for Business", and a choice of either "The Literature of Our Era", "Great Moments in English Literature" or "Technical Communications: Written and Verbal" along with 15 electives of your choice. Recommended electives include classes in entrepreneurship, sociology, digital humanities, philosophy, and more.

Gustavson does not use the traditional business curriculum and, instead, uses three fields of specialization: international business, service management and entrepreneurship. Gustavson is the business school that teaches all specializations in an “integrative” manner with collaborative/team-based instruction.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

One strategy to attract high achieving students at the Gustavson School of Business is the mandatory co-op mandate for all undergraduates.
The business school has failed to acknowledge whether students are co-oping at companies of relevance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Master of Business Administration (MBA)

The UVic MBA at the Gill Graduate School can be completed in either Daytime or Evening schedules. The Daytime program or Full-time MBA is 17 months in length with a specialization and a co-op term. During the specialization term, students have the option of either studying at an international partner institutions in more than 12 different countries or choose one of the two specializations at Gustavson. Each non-exchange student also participates in an international integrated management exercise (IIME), at which time the students travel to Asia, Europe or Latin America to experience doing business in a foreign country. Most of the same curriculum, with the exception of specialization, is covered in the Evening program, which is 24 months in length, with classes on one weekend in each month.


### Master of Global Business (MGB)

The Master of Global Business (MGB) degree program offers those with undergraduate degrees in Commerce, Business Administration or Management, the opportunity to specialize in international business management and leadership at a graduate level.

The MGB program is primarily located at the University of Victoria campus in Victoria, BC, with components delivered by Gustavson faculty at overseas partner institutions in both Asia, at National Sun Yat-Sen University in Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Europe, at Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria.
