After completing her graduate studies, she moved to London, where she was an Engagement Manager at McKinsey & Company.


### Fashion career

Áslaug first became involved in the fashion industry while helping to run a modeling agency during college. She started her professional career in fashion at Baugur Group, an investment company focused on the fashion and retail sectors. During her time at Baugur, Aslaug spearheaded a number of investments in early-stage fashion brands.

In 2006, Áslaug relocated from London to New York and joined Marvin Traub Associates as a Vice President. In 2007, she partnered with Traub, the former CEO of Bloomingdale's, to form an investment company, TSM Capital, which invested in designer brands such as Rachel Roy and Matthew Williamson. She later worked with actor and jewelry designer Waris Ahluwalia as President of his label, House of Waris Fine Jewelry. In 2009, Áslaug joined Gilt Groupe to head merchandising for Gilt Noir.

In 2009, Áslaug came up with the idea for Moda Operandi, a "pre-tailer" that lets consumers pre-order items directly from the runway. She shared the concept with Lauren Santo Domingo, and, together, they co-founded the company.

Áslaug left Moda Operandi in May 2013 after raising $36 million in a Series C round of funding from venture capital firms. With Matthew Pavelle, Gabriel Levy and Cleo Davis-Urman, she co-founded Tinker Tailor, a business that let consumers customize designer clothing or design their own. Tinker Tailor ceased operations in 2015.

In 2020, Áslaug launched Katla, a business focused on sustainable practices in the fashion industry. In 2022, Áslaug was named Goodwill Ambassador for Fashion 4 Development, an organization established to support the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in cooperation with the office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon
