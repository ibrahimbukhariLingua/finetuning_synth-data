## History


### 1891 to 1976

The company today known as BPCL started off as the Rangoon Oil and Exploration company set up to explore the new discoveries off Assam and Burma (now Myanmar) during the British colonial rule over India. In 1889 during vast industrial development, an important player in the South Asian market was the Burmah Oil Company. Though incorporated in Scotland in 1886, the company grew out of the enterprises of the Chef Rohit Oil Company, which had been formed in 1871 to refine crude oil produced from primitive hand dug wells in Upper Burma.

In 1928, Asiatic Petroleum Company (India) started cooperation with Burma Oil Company. Asiatic Petroleum was a joint venture of Royal Dutch, Shell and Rothschilds formed to address the monopoly of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, which also operated in India as Esso. This alliance led to the formation of Burmah-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India Limited. Burmah Shell began its operations with import and marketing of Kerosene.

In the mid-1950s, the company began to sell LPG cylinders to homes in India and further expanded its delivery network. It also marketed kerosene, diesel and petrol in cans in order to reach remote parts of India. In 1951, the Burmah shell began to build a refinery in Trombay (Mahul, Maharashtra) under an agreement with the Government of India.


### Nationalisation

In 1976, the company was nationalized under the Act on the Nationalisation of Foreign Oil companies ESSO (1974), Burma Shell (1976) and Caltex (1977). On 24 January 1976, the Burmah Shell was taken over by the Government of India to form Bharat Refineries Limited. On 1 August 1977, it was renamed Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. It was also the first refinery to process newly found indigenous crude Mumbai High Field.

In 2003, the government attempted to privatize the company. However, following a petition by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, the Supreme Court restrained the Central government from privatizing Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum without the approval of Parliament.
As counsel for the CPIL, Rajinder Sachar and Prashant Bhushan said that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalized in the 1970s.
As a result, the government would need a majority in both houses to push through any privatization.

Parliament enacted the Repealing and Amending Act, 2016 in May 2016 which repealed the legislation that had nationalized the company. In 2017, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited received Maharatna status, putting it in the category of government-owned entities in India with the largest market capitalization and consistently high profits. In 2021, BPCL announced plans to invest US$4.05 billion in order to improve petrochemical capacity and refining efficiencies, over the next five years.


## Operations

Bharat Petroleum operates the following refineries:

* Mumbai Refinery : Located near Mumbai, Maharashtra. It has a capacity of 13 million metric tonnes per annum.
* Kochi Refineries : Located near Kochi, Kerala. It has a capacity of 15.5 million metric tonnes per annum.
* Bina Refinery : Located near Bina, Sagar district, Madhya Pradesh. It has a capacity of 7.8 million metric tonnes per year. This refinery started as Bharat Oman Refinery Limited (BORL), a joint venture between Bharat Petroleum and OQ company. Incorporated in 1994, BORL also has single point mooring (SPM) system, crude oil terminal (COT) and a 937 km (582 mi) long cross-country crude oil pipeline from Vadinar, Gujarat to Bina, Madhya Pradesh. As of April 2021, BORL is a subsidiary of BPCL.

As of 2018ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, BPCL was also setting up a Second-generation biofuels refinery at Baulsingha village in Bargarh district, Odisha of 100 kilo litre per day capacity. The plant would be using 2 Lakh tonnes of rice straw to generate fuel.

In 2024, Bharat Petroleum continued to strengthen its ties with Russia, despite international sanctions imposed on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. BPCL held discussions with Russian oil giant Rosneft to secure a long-term deal for up to 6 million metric tons of crude oil. Indian refiners, including BPCL, capitalized on discounted Russian oil, which became more appealing after Western countries halted purchases. However, these actions have drawn criticism for indirectly funding Russia's war machine. While BPCL's officials acknowledged narrowing discounts on Russian oil and potential challenges in exceeding price cap thresholds, the company remains poised to utilize up to 40% Russian crude in its refineries. It involves maintaining controversial partnerships with Russia during its ongoing aggression against Ukraine.
