Social security in the Republic of Ireland


# Social security in the Republic of Ireland



In Ireland, there are two categories of social security, contributory (social insurance), and non-contributory (social assistance), as well as three main types of payments:

* Social insurance payments
* Means-tested payments
* Universal payments

All benefits are administered by the Department of Social Protection, which is divided into two parts, the Aireacht which is responsible for "policy formulation, legislations and general administration" and Social Welfare Services which is responsible for the "day-to-day running and delivery of services" of the department.

In order to qualify for social assistance, the applicant must undergo a means test and a habitual residence test.

Social assistance programs include:

* Back to Work Family Dividend
* Blind Pension

* Domiciliary Care Allowance
* Guardian's and orphan's Payment (Non-Contributory)
* Jobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance Transitional payment

Disability Allowance is payable to disabled people over 16 and under 66 years of age. The disability must have continued, or be expected to continue, for at least 12 months. It must cause substantial restrictions in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person of your age, experience and qualifications.
