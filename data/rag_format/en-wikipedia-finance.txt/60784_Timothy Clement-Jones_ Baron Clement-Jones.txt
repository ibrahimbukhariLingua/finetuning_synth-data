| Adopted2008 CoronetCoronet of a Baron CrestUpon a helm with a wreath Argent and Sable a lion sejant Sable grasping in the dexter forepaw a fleur-de-lys per pale Argent and Or EscutcheonSable an orle fracted and there conjoined to two chevronels couped all per pale Or and Argent three fleurs-de-lys that in dexter chief Argent that in sinister chief Or and that in base per pale Argent and Or the chevronels enclosing a chevron couped per pale Argent and Or. Motto*Fide Et Diligentia* (Faith and diligence) SymbolismThese armorial bearings were granted with an extension of limitation to be placed on a monument or otherwise displayed in memory of his grandfather and to be borne and used by the grantee and his descendants and the other descendants of his said grandfather. The grantee's family had long used a chevron between three fleurs-de-lys and the crest of a demi lion rampant. Being unable to prove entitlement to these arms and crest, it was deemed desirable to have a new grant which demonstrates that the chevron formation combined with fleurs-de-lys is still possible. Similarly, the lion and fleurs-de-lys may be considered two charges heavily over used in the past. Nonetheless a relatively simple crest, combining these two charges, can be obtained. |
