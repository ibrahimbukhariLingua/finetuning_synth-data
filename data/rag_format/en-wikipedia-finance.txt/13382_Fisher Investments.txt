**Fisher Investments** is an independent money management firm headquartered in Plano, Texas.


## History

Ken Fisher founded the firm in 1979, then served as CEO until July 2016, when he was succeeded by long-time Fisher Investments employee Damian Ornani. Fisher remains active as the firm's executive chairman and co-chief investment officer.

As of June 2024, Fisher Investments and its subsidiaries manage over $275 billion in assets for individual and institutional investors globally. The firm maintains three principal business units: Fisher Investments Institutional Group, Fisher Investments Private Client Group, and Fisher Investments Private Client Group International. In June 2024, the firm announced its 401(k) Solutions business for small to mid-sized retirement plans would be spun off into an independent company called Fisher Retirement Solutions.

The firm incorporated Fisher Investments Europe Limited in 1999 with its headquarters in London. Later it expanded the firm's US operations by opening offices in Vancouver, Washington; Plano, Texas; and Tampa, Florida. The firm also entered into a joint venture in Germany to offer investment services as Grüner Fisher Investments GmbH, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Fisher Investments.

In late 2011, Fisher Investments opened a new headquarters on the 120-acre Fisher Creek campus in Camas, Washington. Over the next three years, Fisher Investments expanded its local presence by constructing two additional buildings on the Fisher Creek campus. In 2020, the company opened a fourth building on the campus. The five-story building has room for an additional 1,100 employees.

Fisher Investments has also opened international offices in eight countries.

The firm announced its intention to move its headquarters to Texas in March 2023. The firm intends to complete the move by June 2023. The company has stated they will maintain offices in Camas, Washington; however staffing will be prioritized in other locations.

In June 2024, Fisher Investments announced that Advent International and ADIA had acquired a minority interest in the firm for $2.5-$3 billion. The deal would result in the firm being valued at $13 billion. Ken Fisher will maintain about 70% ownership.


## Ratings and awards

Grüner Fisher Investments was rated "Best Employer in the (German) Financial Sector" in 2015 by the German investment magazine, *Cash.Online*, and again in 2016 by the magazine *Das Investment*.

Fisher Investments Europe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fisher Investments, was recognized by ADVFN as Wealth Manager of the Year in its International Financial Awards, announced March 8, 2016.


## Corporate culture

According to a 2019 Bloomberg article based on anonymous interviews with former and current Fisher Investments employees, the company's workers contend there is a culture of fear and stress. The pressure on employees to acquire and retain clients is said to be particularly intense. In late 2019, Ken Fisher came under fire for comments he made at a summit for CEOs, where he likened winning clients to "going up to a woman in a bar and saying, hey I want to talk about what's in your pants."
