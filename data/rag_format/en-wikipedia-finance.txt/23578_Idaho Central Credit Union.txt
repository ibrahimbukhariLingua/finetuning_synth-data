# Idaho Central Credit Union



**Idaho Central Credit Union (ICCU)** is a state-chartered credit union in the western United States, headquartered in Chubbuck, Idaho, adjacent to Pocatello. ICCU is the largest credit union in Idaho, with numerous branches serving over 670,000 members with assets over $12 billion; its governing agency is the state's Department of Finance.


## History

Idaho Central Credit Union was organized in Boise as a state-chartered credit union on June 28, 1940, to serve the financial needs of the officers of other credit unions operating in the state of Idaho. At that time, officers could not belong to the credit union where they worked.

In 1953, Idaho Central changed its field of membership to include all members of other Idaho credit unions, and in 1972 it was increased again to of small groups approved by the Department of Finance, who had a common bond and desired credit union membership, but were unable to form a credit union. In 1977, it expanded to retail employees in Ada, Bannock, Bingham, and Power counties. Persons in Oneida, Bear Lake, Franklin, Caribou, and Twin Falls counties were added to the field of membership in 1984.

The field of membership expanded in 1989 to include non-durable wholesale, service, and manufacturing for all counties and to persons in Jerome, Gooding, Lincoln, Blaine, Minidoka, and Cassia counties, and Jackpot, Nevada. In 2008, the establishment of the organization's Central's Business Lending Department added member eligibility for businesses. The most change came with the merger of PSCU in north Idaho, adding Shoshone and
Kootenai counties.

In 2022, Idaho Central Credit Union physically expanded out of Idaho by opening up a branch in downtown Spokane.

Idaho Central is the largest credit union in the state of Idaho, with 52 locations in the Treasure Valley, Magic Valley, Eastern Idaho, Idaho Panhandle, and Washington.
