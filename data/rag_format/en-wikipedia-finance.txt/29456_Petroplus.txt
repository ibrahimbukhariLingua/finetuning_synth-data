# Petroplus



**Petroplus Holdings AG** was Europe's largest independent oil refiner by capacity. When it was first formed in 1993, it was known as **Petroplus International N.V.**, and was based in the Netherlands. In August 1998, it was listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. In April 2005, it was delisted from the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange when the company was acquired by a holding company. In November 2006, the company went public on the Swiss Stock Exchange.

In 1997, it acquired the **Antwerp N.V. Refinery** from the Daewoo Group.

## Financial problems

In December 2011 a $1bn credit line to the company was frozen by its bank lenders. The company was planning to shut down some refineries if negotiations to restore the credit failed. The chief executive said they would do all they could to avoid bankruptcy. On 24 January 2012, Petroplus announced that they were filing for insolvency after it defaulted on $1.75bn of senior notes and convertible bonds.
