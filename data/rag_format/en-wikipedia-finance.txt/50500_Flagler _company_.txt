# Flagler (company)



**Flagler** is a commercial real estate company headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida. Flagler is a corporate legacy of American businessman Henry M. Flagler.

The company has developed more than 30 million square feet of commercial real estate space over the past 30 years. It also owns more than 2,500 acres of developable land statewide, and manages or leases more than 13 million square feet of commercial property. The Flagler company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Florida East Coast Industries. Its development projects include the new world headquarters for Bacardi USA, in Miami; Office Depot's world headquarters, in Boca Raton; and Miami's Flagler Station, South Florida's largest business park.

Flagler has shifted its focus in recent years away from owning commercial real estate properties, and more towards development and providing brokerage, property management and asset management services to larger, institutional clients.


## History

Flagler's origins date back to the original railroad company founded by Henry M. Flagler in 1888. After visiting Florida with his sick wife, Flagler saw the state's great potential for tourism. He began purchasing small railroad companies, and started expanding his rail network down Florida's eastern seaboard. Florida East Coast Railway eventually stretched from Jacksonville to Key West.
To support rail operations, Flagler also invested millions of dollars developing new infrastructure such as hotels, resorts, roadways, and utilities.

In 1983, the St. Joe Company, which was named FECR's majority shareholder in 1961 following a lengthy bankruptcy, split off the real estate operations from the rail company. Known first as Gran Central Corporation and later as Flagler Development Company, the firm merged in 2006 with another large real estate developer and service provider, the Codina Group, and changed its name to Flagler Development Group.

In 2009, Fortress Investment Group purchased Flagler's parent company, Florida East Coast Industries, which still also owned FECR, for $3.5 billion. Shortly after, Fortress spun off FECR into a separate, distinct company.

Following the arrival of Vincent Signorello as company President and CEO in 2010, FECI underwent a significant strategic realignment, resulting in the creation of four distinct companies all operating under the FECI umbrella: All Aboard Florida (operator of Brightline), Flagler Global Logistics, Parallel Infrastructure, and Flagler Development.

In 2012, the company sold off a significant developed portion of its Flagler Station business park in Miami, while holding on to the undeveloped parcels.
