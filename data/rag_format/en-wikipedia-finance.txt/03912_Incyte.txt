## History

In 2014, Incyte named Herv√© Hoppenot president and CEO, and in 2015 he was appointed chairman of the Board of Directors. Hoppenot had previously served as the president of Novartis Oncology; he had been with Novartis since 2003.

In September 2015, the company announced it had gained exclusive development and commercial right pertaining to Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd's anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, SHR-1210, in a deal worth $795+ million.

In January 2020, Incyte signed a collaboration and license agreement for the global development and commercialization of tafasitamab with MorphoSys. On March 3, 2020, the agreement received antitrust clearance and thus became effective.

Incyte established a European headquarters in Morges, Switzerland, in 2021.
