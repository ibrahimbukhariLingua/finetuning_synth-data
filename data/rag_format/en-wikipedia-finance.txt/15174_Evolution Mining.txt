It also operates the Red Lake mine, which is an underground gold mine in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.


### History

This growth has seen it become a mid-tier Australian mining company and 52 on the ASX top 200 Australian publicly listed companies.

In April 2015, Evolution completed the buy-out of La Mancha Resources Australian operations, valued at A$300 million, and thereby acquired the Frog's Leg and White Foil gold mines as well as the nearby processing plant at the Mungari. Mining at Frog's Leg is carried out in an underground operation while White Foil is an open pit operation, with the ore processed at the Mungari plant, which was constructed in 2013–14.

In May 2021 the company acquired Toronto Stock Exchange-listed Battle North Gold for CAD$343 million for its Bateman (formerly Phoenix) gold project near Red Lake, Ontario.
