## History

Hopin was founded in 2020 by Johnny Boufarhat. Its platform allowed meeting participants for conference attending and networking online, exchange virtual business cards, and get a summary of their connections after an event. It become increasingly popular in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hopin raised over $1 billion in funding from various investors, including Accel, IVP, Coatue Management, Northzone, Salesforce Ventures, and others. Following a share buyback for shareholders of over $500M+, the company sold its events unit assets, including its technology, customers and engineering and product teams, to RingCentral for $50 million in August 2023. The company continued to operate its live-streaming and video hosting products Streamyard and Streamable.

By August 2023, Hopin's valuation was slumped to $3.85 billion, from a high of $7.8 billion in 2021.

In February 2024, Hopin moved its headquarters to the United States and closed its UK Corporate entity. Hopin sold its business suite (Streamyard, Streamable and Superwave) to Bending Spoons in April 2024.
