## History

In 1979, Persetel (Proprietary) Limited was established, marking the beginning of BCX's history. This company played a significant role in the subsequent formation of BCX. In 1997, Persetel merged with Q Data Limited, leading to the creation of the Persetel Q Data Holdings group of companies.

Following the merger, Persetel Q Data Holdings embarked on a series of networking acquisitions in Europe. These acquisitions allowed the company to expand its reach and enhance its capabilities in the ICT sector. As a result of these developments, the company underwent a name change in November 1998 and became known as Comparex Holdings.

The name change to Comparex Holdings reflected the company's transformation and growth, showcasing its position as a key player in the ICT industry. The acquisition of European networking companies and the subsequent rebranding demonstrated Comparex Holdings' commitment to expanding its operations and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.

In December 2003, Comparex announced its plans to merge with Business Connection, leading to the largest Information Technology black economic empowerment deal in 2004. The merger between Comparex and Business Connection resulted in a new combined entity with annual revenue exceeding R3 billion at the time. BCX, founded in 1996 by CEO Benjamin Mophatlane and his twin brother Isaac Mophatlane, had previously merged with Seattle Solutions in 2001.

After the merger, the combined entity was rebranded as Business Connexion (Proprietary) Limited. Additionally, the holdings company underwent a name change and became known as Business Connexion Group Limited. Since the merger, the company has been trading under the share code "BCX." Business Connexion was subsequently listed as a separate entity on May 28, 2004.
