## Early life and education

Arseneau was born in Canada and began his education at the University of New Brunswick where he became interested in neural networks in 1986. He completed his electrical engineering degree with a senior project entitled "VLSI and Neural Systems". His interest in computational intelligence continued at the University of Aberdeen where he researched the application of neural networks to software reengineering. This research went on to form the foundation to a patent being awarded to Raymond Obin and Brian Reynolds for a commercial reengineering process. Arseneau expanded his research into other areas of biologically-inspired systems (computational intelligence), which included; neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, swarm intelligence, and intelligent agents. His earlier research on computational intelligence and reengineering (software) is frequently cited.


## Career


### Early years

He was an early adopter of internet technologies and leveraging his earlier academic work in Software Engineering, he built one of the first Internet-based (HTML) project management tools while at JPMorgan in 1996. The tool was sold to a silicon valley start-up called Netmosphere that eventfully was bought by public company Critical Path in June 2000.
