# American Advisors Group



**American Advisors Group (AAG)** is an American reverse mortgage lender. It provides government-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) loans and has 81 geographical areas approved for business by HUD.


## History

The group was founded in 2004 by Reza Jahangiri, president and chief executive officer.

In June 2009 the company received a capital-infusion commitment from private-equity firm JAM Equity Partners of El Segundo, California, an investment said to give AAG "the resources needed to compete on a national level with a celebrity spokesperson and [to] build a recognizable brand." At the same time, the company announced "a new management team" from Liberty Reverse Mortgage/Genworth and the Senior Lending Network. Jahangiri told *Reverse Mortgage Daily* that the company would be "sticking with retail" rather than moving to other aspects of the business.

The firm completed its first Home Mortgage-Backed Security
(HMBS) issuance in July 2013, after receiving approval from Ginnie Mae, in a program said to be "an essential financial solution for a growing number of senior citizens.". The company was named as the leading HMBS issuer for the first half of 2015, according to NewView Advisors, LLC.
