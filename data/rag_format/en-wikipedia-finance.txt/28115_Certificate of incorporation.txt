Certificate of incorporation


# Certificate of incorporation



A **certificate of incorporation** is a legal document/license relating to the formation of a company or corporation. It is a license to form a corporation issued by the state government or, in some jurisdictions, by a non-governmental entity/corporation. Its precise meaning depends upon the legal system in which it is used.


## Commonwealth systems

In the U.S. a certificate of incorporation is usually used as an alternative description of a corporation's **articles of incorporation**. The certificate of incorporation, or articles of incorporation, form a major constituent part of the constitutional documents of the corporation. In English and Commonwealth legal systems, a certificate of incorporation is usually a simple certificate issued by the relevant government registry as confirmation of the due incorporation and valid existence of the company.

In other common law legal systems, the certificate of incorporation has less legal significance. However, it has been held by the House of Lords in *Cotman v Brougham* (1918), AC 514, that because the issue of the certificate of incorporation is conclusive evidence of the formation of a company, the issuance of the certificate overrides any irregularities which may have occurred during the formation of the company.


## Vietnam

In Vietnam, the Certificate of incorporation plays a crucial role. It not only serves as a confirmation of the legal existence of a business but also constitutes an indispensable part of the company's legal documentation. This certificate records fundamental information about the enterprise, including its name, registration number, address, business lines, charter capital, and other essential details.
