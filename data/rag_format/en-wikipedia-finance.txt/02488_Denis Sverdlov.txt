In 2012–13, he was Russia's deputy minister for communications and mass media.

Sverdlov was born in 1978 in Agara in the then Soviet republic of Georgia.

Post-acquisition Sverdlov set up the Kinetik Trust to invest in a range of promising technologies and bring them to market.

He was Russia's deputy Communications and Mass Media Minister for 15 months before stepping down in 2013. He left this position following new legislation which banned government officials from holding assets abroad.
