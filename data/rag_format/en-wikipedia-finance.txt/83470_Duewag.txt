**Düwag** or **Duewag** (stylised in all caps), formerly **Waggonfabrik Uerdingen**, was a German manufacturer of rail vehicles. It was sold in 1999 to Siemens with the brand later retired.


## History

Duewag was founded in March 1898 as **Waggonfabrik Uerdingen** in Uerdingen and produced rail vehicles under the Düwag brand. After merging with **Düsseldorfer Waggonfabrik** in 1935, railway vehicles were built in Uerdingen, while the Düsseldorf plant produced mainly local traffic vehicles, namely tramway and light rail vehicles. In 1981, the company changed its name from Waggonfabrik Uerdingen to Duewag.

Siemens acquired a 60% shareholding in 1989 before taking full ownership in April 1999. In 2001, the Düsseldorf plant was closed with production transferred to Uerdingen.

Duewag vehicles were close to a monopoly market in West Germany, as nearly every tram and light rail vehicle purchased from the 1960s onward was built by Duewag.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
