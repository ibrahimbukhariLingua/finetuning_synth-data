## Research

Lehdonvirta is one of the world’s most cited authors on gig work and the platform economy. He was the principal investigator of iLabour, a major research project on online freelancing and the gig economy, funded by the European Research Council. He is the creator (together with Otto Kässi and Fabian Stephany) of the Online Labour Index, an economic indicator and international reference for the measurement of the global online gig-economy. He also led research projects on online labour markets' effects in rural areas, crowd workers' skill development, and changing online worker livelihoods during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lehdonvirta's research on platforms, marketplaces, and digital commerce is summarised in *Cloud Empires: How Digital Platforms Are Overtaking the State and How We Can Regain Control*, published by MIT Press and translated to Italian by Einaudi. The book was announced as a finalist for a 2023 PROSE Award by the Association of American Publishers (AAP).

Lehdonvirta's earlier research dealt with the history and politics of Bitcoin and blockchain. His research on virtual goods, virtual consumption and digital games is summarised in *Virtual Economies: Design and Analysis*, co-authored with Edward Castronova, published by MIT Press and translated to Japanese and Chinese.

Lehdonvirta's recent research focuses on the geopolitics of digital infrastructures, such as cloud data centres and GPUs.
