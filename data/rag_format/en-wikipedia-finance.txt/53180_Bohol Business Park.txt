# Bohol Business Park



**Bohol Business Park** (BBP), is an under-construction, mixed-use 7-hectare (17-acre) business park and development in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, Philippines. The business park is designed to accommodate and attract BPO and IT locators. Built within the site of the former Tagbilaran City Airport, the business district will house call centers, commercial establishments, IT business establishments, and other establishments. A convention center is also being proposed to be established also within the former Tagbilaran Airport site.

The Bohol Business Park broke ground on May 15, 2024, and the first BPO building is set to commence operations by the first or last quarter of 2025.


## History

The Bohol Business Park was first proposed back in 2018 by former Boholano Governor Edgar Chatto after the closure of the former Tagbilaran Airport. The mixed-use development was planned to include commercial spaces and entertainment centers such as a convention center and coliseum, and spanning 28 hectares in size.
