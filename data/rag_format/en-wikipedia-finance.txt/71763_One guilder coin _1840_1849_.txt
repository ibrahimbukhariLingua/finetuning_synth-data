One guilder coin (1840–1849)


# One guilder coin (1840–1849)



The Dutch **One guilder coin** struck under the reign of King William II was a unit of currency in the Netherlands.


## History

After the succession of William II to the Dutch throne his portrait replaced that of William I on the obverse of the Netherlands' coins. The reverses remained the same.
After some trial strikes dated 1840, production began in 1842 and continued without interruption until 1849; the year in which William II died.
The year with the highest mintage was 1848, 13.6 million, or 38.7% of the total amount struck is dated 1848.

As a result of the rising silver prices after the First World War, from 1922 onward the silver content of most Dutch coins were lowered. Then, on 31 December 1931 all Dutch guilder coins struck prior to 1922 were redeemed and demonetized. The number of coins handed in this way was quite low, probably many of them had been melted down for their silver content.
