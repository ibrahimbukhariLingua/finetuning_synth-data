# Kenyan taxation system



The **Kenyan taxation system** covers income tax, value-added tax, customs and excise duty. The regulations are governed by independent legislators that govern the taxation system, the main legislator, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has different sections that deal with the above taxes while also having the authority to undertake reviews on various companies and corporations. The main goal of the system is to enhance tax compliance through simplified and efficient tax administration.


## Income tax

The Income Tax Act is the most important tax used in Kenya. It is up to the employer to make sure that the taxes are deducted at source, that employees pay taxes and that they have a personal identification number (PIN) with the KRA. There is a fine of $22 for every payment made to an employee who does not have a PIN. The tax rate is 30% for everyone but there are many exemptions from tax including medical insurance for an employee and his all of his / her dependents, the reimbursement of expenses incurred by employees while working and there is a non cash benefit of up to $396 per month to all employees. There is also a PAYE tax which is applicable to all employees that is calculated as follows.
