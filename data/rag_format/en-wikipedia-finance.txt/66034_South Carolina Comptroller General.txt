South Carolina Comptroller General


# South Carolina Comptroller General



The **comptroller general of South Carolina** is a constitutional officer in the executive branch of the U.S. state of South Carolina. Forty individuals have held the office of comptroller general since 1800. The office has been held by Brian J. Gaines since May 12, 2023, who was appointed by Governor Henry McMaster as a recess appointment following the resignation of Richard Eckstrom on April 30, 2023. McMaster appointed Gaines to avoid a constitutional crisis; since the office was vacant, no person could authorize the distribution of funds.

The South Carolina Code of Laws of 1976, Title 11, Chapter 3 describes the responsibilities of the Office of the Comptroller General.


## History

At the turn of the 19th century, the state of South Carolina's finances were marked by confusion, with officials having difficulty in ascertaining its debts. In response, the office of comptroller general was created with Paul Hamilton as the inaugural holder. In 1948, the comptroller general was added to the State Budget and Control Board, a body tasked with helping to craft the state's budget. The body was changed to the State Fiscal Accountability Authority in 2015.


## Election and structure

South Carolina is one of twelve states in the country with an elected comptroller. The only qualification for candidates for the office is that they be a registered voter in the state. Comptrollers general serve renewable terms of four years.

The comptroller general's office is housed in the Wade Hampton State Office Building. As of May 31, 2023, the agency is staffed by 27 employees. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the General Assembly is empowered by the constitution to appoint a new incumbent. In the event the assembly is not in session, the governor can fill the vacancy with a recess appointment. The comptroller collects an annual salary of $151,000.


## Powers and duties

The comptroller general is one of eight statewide constitutional officers in South Carolina. They serve as the chief accountant and fiscal watchdog of state government. As such, the comptroller general monitors state spending, issues warrants authorizing the payment of funds out of the state treasury, maintains the state's accounting system, establishes internal controls for state agencies, provides financial services to state agencies and local governments, and prepares reports on the financial operations and condition of state government, including the state's annual comprehensive financial report. All payrolls for state employees, vouchers for bills owed by the state, and payments between state agencies are processed by the comptroller general.

The comptroller general is also a member of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority (SFAA), an independent state agency which includes the governor, the state treasurer, and the chairs of the budget committees in the General Assembly. The SFAA is generally charged with oversight of state spending and management of state property. In particular, the SFAA acquires insurance for state agencies and local governments, procures goods and services for the operations of state government, and oversees the construction and maintenance of state buildings. In addition, the SFAA appoints South Carolina's state auditor to serve at pleasure.
