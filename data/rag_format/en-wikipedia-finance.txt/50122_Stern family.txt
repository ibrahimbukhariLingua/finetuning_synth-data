Stern family


# Stern family



The **Stern family** is a Jewish French banking family originally from Frankfurt. It traces back to Samuel Hayum Stern (1760–1819), who in the 1780s became a wine merchant in Frankfurt.

His son, Jacob Samuel Heyum Stern, started a banking business, named Jacob S.H. Stern [de], in 1805 in Frankfurt. His sons expanded the family venture to Berlin, London, and Paris, of which the latter became most prominent as Bank Stern and later as J. Stern & Co.
