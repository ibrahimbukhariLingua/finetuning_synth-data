Norwegian Export Council


# Norwegian Export Council



The **Norwegian Export Council** (Norwegian: *Norges Eksportråd*) was a Norwegian state-owned consultant organ established in 1945. Its role was to provide consultancy and advice for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in export-related matters. Until 1994 the council was financed by a levy on exports, but from 1996 it was a foundation co-financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. It was superseded by Innovation Norway on 1 January 2004.
