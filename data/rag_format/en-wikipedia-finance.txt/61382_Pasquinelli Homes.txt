**Pasquinelli Homes** was a Chicago, Illinois based home building company, founded in 1956 by brothers Bruno and Tony Pasquinelli.

In 2007, it was the fifth largest privately owned home building company in the United States (per number of units sold) according to Builder Magazine's 2007 Builder 100 report.

The company initially built only in the Chicago area, but expanded to Colorado and Florida in the early 1970s. Poor market conditions i forced it to stop construction in Florida in 1976, and Colorado in 1986. In 1988, the company began building in Charlotte, North Carolina under the name Portrait Homes. Subsequently, Pasquinelli has expanded that brand to markets in South Carolina, Indiana, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
