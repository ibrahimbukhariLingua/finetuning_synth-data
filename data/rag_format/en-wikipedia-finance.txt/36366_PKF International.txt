## History

Pannell Kerr Forster was founded in 1969 when four accountancy firms from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States joined to create an international association. The four firms were:

* Pannell Fitzpatrick & Co, founded in 1869 by William Henry Pannell (UK);
* Harris, Kerr, Forster & Co, founded in 1911 as Harris, Kerr & Co by William Harris & Errol Kerr, and in 1923 as WJ Forster & Co by William Forster (USA);
* Campbell, Sharp, Nash & Field (Canada); and
* Wilson, Bishop, Bowes & Craig (Australia).

In 1980, member firms decided to use Pannell Kerr Forster as their common brand name to create an international accountancy brand. In 2000, member firms decided to shorten their name to PKF. Member firms are now adopting this name in their home markets, or adding PKF as a prefix to the existing firm name.

As of January 2011ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, over 21,000 staff were employed by PKF International member firms.

In 2013, PKF's associate firm in UK defected and joined BDO after a fall in revenue and staff reduction.

In 2016, PKF's associate firm in Hong Kong was banned by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for three years due to not co-operating with a probe.
