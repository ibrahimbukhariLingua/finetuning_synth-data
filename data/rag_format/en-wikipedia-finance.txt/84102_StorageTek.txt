StorageTek


# StorageTek



**Storage Technology Corporation** (**StorageTek** or **STK**, earlier **STC**) was a data storage technology company headquartered in Louisville, Colorado. New products include data retention systems, which it calls "information lifecycle management" (ILM).

Its remaining product line is now part of Oracle Corporation, and marketed as **Oracle StorageTek**, with a focus on tape backup equipment and software to manage storage systems.


## History

In 1969 four former IBM engineers—Jesse Aweida, Juan Rodriguez, Thomas S. Kavanagh, and Zoltan Herger—founded the Storage Technology Corporation. The headquarters was in Louisville, Boulder County, Colorado.

In the 1970s, StorageTek launched its Disk Products division. After a failed attempt to develop an IBM-compatible mainframe, and an optical disk product line, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1984. Starting in 1987, new management invested in an automated tape library product line that "picked" tapes from a silo-like contraption with a robot arm. StorageTek emerged as a dominant player in that market.

StorageTek acquired Documation (1980), Aspen Peripherals Corporation (1989), Network Systems Corporation (1995), and Storability (2005).

Storage Technology Corporation was officially renamed "StorageTek" in 1983.


### Sun Microsystems

In June 2005, Sun Microsystems, Inc. announced it would purchase StorageTek for US$4.1 billion in cash, or $37.00 per share. In August 2005, the acquisition was completed.


### Oracle

On January 27, 2010, Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation for US$7.4 billion. The StorageTek product line was renamed "Oracle StorageTek".
