## Meaning of name

His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej bestowed the name on the Graduate Institute of Business Administration on his 60th birthday, 5 December 1987. The name comes from two Sanskrit words: "sasa" and "indra". Sasa, meaning "rabbit" represents the king's birth year in the Thai 12-year astrological cycle. Indra means "chief." Thus "Sasin" literally means "king of the rabbits."
