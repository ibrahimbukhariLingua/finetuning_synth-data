## Origin, education and profession

Born in Tokyo, Illies was heir of a Hamburg merchant family as the son of Carl Jürgen Illies. His great-grandfather Carl Illies senior (1840-1910) had taken over the oldest German-Japanese trading house Louis Kniffler & Co. in 1880 founded in Nagasaki in 1859 and renamed it Carl Illies & Co.

In Hamburg, Illies attended the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums, completed an apprenticeship at the Berenberg Bank after his Abitur and then studied economics in the USA. After a traineeship with an American shipping company, he joined his father's company in 1958 and took over the management in 1966. Illies expanded the activities of the trading house to selected cities in Africa and the China network with eight additional office locations. Illies died at only 59 years of age and left the company to his son Carl Michael Illies, who is now the 5th generation to run the trading house.
