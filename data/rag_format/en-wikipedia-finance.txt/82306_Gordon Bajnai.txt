# Gordon Bajnai



**György Gordon Bajnai** (Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈɡordon ˈbɒjnɒi]; born 5 March 1968) is a Hungarian entrepreneur and economist, who served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 2009 to 2010. Prior to that, he functioned as Minister of Local Government and Regional Development from 2007 to 2008, then as Minister of National Development and Economy from 2008 to 2009. In March 2009, following Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány's announced resignation, Bajnai was nominated by the ruling Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) to become Hungary's next head of government. Bajnai became prime minister when the parliament passed a constructive motion of no-confidence against Ferenc Gyurcsány on 14 April 2009. He held the office until the formation of the Second Orbán Government following the 2010 parliamentary election.

Returning to politics, Bajnai established Together 2014, a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations, in October 2012. The movement would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties to contrast Orbán's Fidesz in the 2014 parliamentary election with Bajnai as its prime minister-candidate, but negotiations have failed with the other opposition parties. Thereafter, the Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, and Bajnai had gradually marginalized in the upcoming months. He retired from politics after the 2014 parliamentary and European Parliament elections.


## Studies and student politics

## Entrepreneurial career

After earning his master's degree, Bajnai took a job at Creditum Financial Consulting Ltd. In 1993, he undertook an internship at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. Later he also worked for Eurocorp International Finance Ltd.

Between 1995 and 2000, Bajnai was the managing director of CA IB Securities Co., and was the Deputy Chief Executive Officer (at the same time when András Simor, later head of National Bank of Hungary, was the head of the company).

## Political career


### Member of the Gyurcsány II Cabinet

Bajnai first received a government post in 2006. On 1 July, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány's called on him to be the Government Commissioner for Development Policy. In this position, he was overseeing the National Development Agency, that controls EU Funds to Hungary.

He became minister in July 2007, in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development. After SZDSZ left the coalition government, in May 2008, he took over the newly formed Ministry of National Development and Economy. During his period as Minister, Hungary has won the right to host the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, and at the same time Mercedes has concluded a major FDI with the Hungarian Government in Kecskemét. From October 2008, Bajnai's activities had mainly focused on managing the evolving crisis in the real economy in Hungary.

In March 2009, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány resigned, announcing that he would hand over his position to a new premier with a higher support of the parties of the Hungarian Parliament. The Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) opposed most candidates for the post proposed by the Hungarian Socialists. Although Bajnai was reluctant to give in, after a week, with no tangible results in sight, and being asked by the majority of party stakeholders, who also assured him of their support of the needed austerity measures, he took the job. Securing the backing of both parties, Bajnai became prime minister on 14 April 2009.


### Prime minister

The Hungarian Parliament elected Bajnai as Hungary's prime minister with 204 votes for, 8 abstentions. The remaining 174 MPs did not vote.

In his first speech as PM, he promised drastic measures to stop the negative spiral of the Hungarian economy, and to ease the burden of the international crisis. He also stated that he would remain in power until he had the solid majority of Parliament behind his austerity package, but will stay no longer than a year.

He did not want to nominate himself on the next election; he undertook the task for only a year. Attila Mesterházy became the Hungarian Socialist Party's candidate for the position. The MSZP suffered its worst result since the 1990 elections. The sixth National Assembly of Hungary formed on 14 May 2010. In accordance with the Constitution of Hungary Bajnai became "acting Prime Minister" for the following days. In his last speech he raised word against the Jobbik fearing for democracy given the party's radical views.

The new cabinet formed on 29 May 2010. Bajnai was succeeded by Viktor Orbán. After that he retired from politics and returned to business life.


#### Economic policy

Bajnai took over an economy that was expected to contract by 6 percent in 2009 and was kept afloat by a $25.1 billion IMF-led lifeline. Foreign investors were declining to finance Hungary's high budget and then current account deficits, and the forint's weakness threatened hundreds of thousands of families who took out foreign currency mortgages. Bajnai must have had to cut spending to rescue the budget, keep within IMF guidelines and regain investor confidence.

The Bajnai government had four main goals:

* Immediate crisis management (Activities: Stabilization of the financial system, Safeguarding jobs, supporting those who lose their jobs, Programmes to help the financing of SMS’s; Accelerating absorption of EU funds)
* Stimulating economic growth (Activities: Reforming the tax system; Extra-budgetary regulations; Extra-Measures to increase activity)
* Balancing the economy (Activities: Measures for the sustainable operation of the public sector; Improving the sustainability of the pension system; Creating a more targeted social system)
* Restoring Global trust (Activities: Restoring public order and confidence; Restoring confidence; Solidarity:state, politics, wealthy people; Anti-corruption measures; Helping pensioners; Providing continuous information to the public on Government activities; Establishing a national crisis Fund to help the most needy)

Handling the ruling Socialists might have been his most difficult task. He needed their votes but a sizeable section of the party viewed Bajnai with contempt because cuts in welfare spending was seen as eroding the party's traditional voter base. Despite this, Bajnai made a reform in taxes, pensions, public sector bonuses, maternity support, mortgage subsidies, energy subsidies and public transport subsidies.

Within six months, he managed to present a new budget that reduced government spending by five percent of GDP. Hungarian economic policy has regained its credibility, CDS-spread was less than one third of the level of a year before.

In an interview given to Handelsblatt, Bajnai said: “Most of the painful decisions were taken during the first 100 days of my government” (…)“It was clear what Hungary had to do, even if it was not easy politically. (…) This required painful adjustments from the people. Our challenge was keeping things bearable while simultaneously creating better conditions for stable and sustainable development. We have accomplished that goal.”

On the protest, he called for an anti-Orbán coalition so as to form a supermajority in Parliament with the help of which the changes done by Orbán's ruling party, Fidesz could be undone.

In his speech, Gordon Bajnai repeatedly used a variant of the term ("*We may fail on our own, but together, we shall prove victorious!*"), when he proclaimed his support for such a "*cooperation between hopeful left-wingers, disappointed rightwingers, politically abandoned free-thinkers and committed Greens*" that his organization along with two other civilian body named Together 2014 (later simply known as "Together") as a reference to the date of the next general election in Hungary. In December 2012, Bajnai announced his intention to be a parliamentarian candidate in the 2014 general election.

On 14 January 2014, five opposition parties entered into an electoral coalition and formed Unity alliance. In order to facilitate the creation of this alliance, Bajnai voluntarily gave up his candidacy of Prime Ministership, in favor of Attila Mesterházy, the candidate of MSZP, the largest party of this coalition. Unity, under the leadership of Mesterházy suffered a heavy defeat in the April election, nevertheless Bajnai was elected to the National Assembly from the second place of the alliance's joint list.
