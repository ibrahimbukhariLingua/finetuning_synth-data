Croatian dinar


# Croatian dinar



The **dinar** was the currency of Croatia between 1991 and 1994. The ISO 4217 code was HRD.


## History

The Croatian dinar replaced the 1990 version of the Yugoslav dinar at par on 23 December 1991. It was a transitional currency introduced following Croatia's declaration of independence. During its existence, the dinar declined in value by a factor of about 70.

On 30 May 1994, the dinar was replaced by the kuna at a rate of 1 kuna = 1000 dinara. The currency was not used in the occupied territories comprising the Republic of Serbian Krajina.
