## History

The company was incorporated in 1992 as Janashakthi Life Insurance Company Limited. In 1994, Janashakthi Insurance commenced operations as Sri Lanka's first specialised life insurance company. Janashakthi General Insurance Co Limited was launched in the following year. The two companies merged to form Janashakthi Insurance Co Ltd in 2000. In 2002, the company expanded to the Maldives, thus becoming the first Sri Lankan insurer to operate overseas. Janashakthi Insurance became a public company with its listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2008. The conflicting statutory provisions have caused a dispute between National Development Bank (NDB) and Janashakthi Insurance over an ownership concentration. NDB sought an interim injunction against Janashakthi Insurance to prevent interference by Janashakthi Insurance. The District Judge of Colombo dismissed the interim injunction and held that Janashakthi Insurance is not in violation of the Banking Act. However, the dispute was resolved after the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) pressured Janashakthi Insurance to decrease its excessive shareholding in NDB.

The IBSL briefly suspended the company over a solvency concern in May 2009. However, the IBSL's actions were criticised for their hastiness. The company acquired AIA General Insurance Lanka in 2015 for LKR3.2 billion. The acquisition increased the market share to 17.5% and making the company the third largest insurance company by revenue. However, the company divested its general insurance business to Allianz in 2018 for LKR16.7 billion. Janashakthi Insurance sold a leasehold land at 24, Staple Street in Colombo 2 to Sanken Construction for LKR1.93 billion. Janashakthi Insurance claimed a profit of LKR940 million out of the transaction. The 25th anniversary of operations of the company was celebrated in 2019.
