## UFO/UAP work

In a 2016 interview with Leslie Kean published on the now-closed HuffPost Contributor Forum, Mellon stated:

> I highly doubt DoD or any other government agency is concealing UFO information. I participated in a comprehensive review of DoD's black programs and spent over a decade conducting oversight of the national foreign intelligence program, an almost totally separate world of secrets. I visited Area 51 and other military, intelligence and research facilities. During all those years, I never detected the faintest hint of government interest or involvement in UFOs. ... While a few new, previously overlooked documents might turn up (the bureaucracy is never perfect), I do not believe they would resolve the UFO issue or provide significant new insights. I can think of one lengthy UFO report that is classified only due to concerns over sources and methods. In fact, it identified a convincing conventional explanation for the pilot sightings in this particular case. There are lots of classified documents related to activities at Area 51, where high security is needed. But this is all legitimate stuff the American people would support. They have nothing to do with UFOs, to the best of my knowledge.

However, in a March 2022 opinion piece published by The Hill, Mellon stated:

> I am approaching the UAP topic as a member of two serious groups of scientific researchers, the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU). Both of these UAP research organizations have gathered able groups of scientists who are seeking to advance our collective understanding of UAP anomalies. Those efforts now appear to be hindered by new guidance that moves the classification yardsticks merely because some U.S. government officials dislike oversight and are uncomfortable sharing information.

Mellon continued, "since DOD isn’t claiming retroactively that the “Gimbal,” “Go Fast” or “FLIR1” videos themselves are or ever should have been classified, or that their release has damaged national security, by what authority are they now claiming the need or right to classify the same sorts of information going forward?" Mellon worked with Leslie Kean in a UFO organization and is a shareholder and former advisor for the Blink 182 punk rocker Tom DeLonge's To The Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences. According to the company’s website, Mellon's title was "national security affairs advisor". Mellon assisted in production and worked with former Pentagon Director of AATIP, Luis Elizondo as a cast member for the cable television network History that distributes the shows series *Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation*.

Mellon was featured in the 2020 UFO documentary *The Phenomenon*, which was directed by UFO enthusiast James Fox. In the documentary, Mellon stated that he was the source who provided the three Pentagon UFO videos which made the "lavish front-page Sunday spread" of the New York Times on December 17, 2017: "Glowing Auras and ‘Black Money’: The Pentagon’s Mysterious UFO Program". In the documentary, Mellon claims he met with an individual in the parking lot of the Pentagon and was handed a package containing three videos recorded by U.S. Navy pilots between 2004 and 2015.

Mellon was featured on episode #1645 of the Joe Rogan Experience on May 5, 2021.

In 2023, Mellon penned an opinion piece for Politico, expressing his desire for Congress' investigation into UFO claims to move forward. He also told media that he backed some of the claims made by David Grusch in a 2023 United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability hearing, and said that "rightly or wrongly, a number of potential sources do not trust the leadership of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office established by Congress.”
