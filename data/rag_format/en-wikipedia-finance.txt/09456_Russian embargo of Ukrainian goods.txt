The newspaper describes the events as opening of the first front of "economic war" against Ukraine. This is indicated in the investigation that Russia wants to maintain its influence over Ukraine.


### Opinions of experts and politicians

* Ukrainian political scientist, political strategist, analyst and director of the Institute of Global Strategies Vadim Karasyov said:

> Reason for such actions of Russia is Ukraine's intent to sign Association Agreement and Free Trade Area Agreement with the European Union. That is European integration to EU. Thats why Russia if not to disrupt then to complicate process of signing of Association Agreement between Ukraine and EU at the Vilnius Summit of Eastern Partnership in November of 2013 starts total economic embargo of Ukraine instead of local temporary trade conflicts.

## Effects

According to the Federation of Employers of Ukraine in the beginning of the embargo the loss for Ukraine from the Russia's actions can reach $2–2,5 billion in the second half of 2013.

Experts also believe that the unpredictable behaviour of Russia will force Ukrainian businessmen to seek new markets for their products, as well as make supporters of joining the "Customs Union" change their mind.

Also, according to Radio "Liberty" with reference to the heads of the companies in the end of August 2013 it was reported that some Ukrainian companies through the trade confrontation between Ukraine and Russia are shifting to other markets. Some companies do not feel any problems with exports.

Representatives of EU said they are ready to introduce additional steps to support Ukraine - from simplification of visa for Ukraine to financial help. Also, EU thinks about complication of access to European market for Russian goods.
