## Causes

According to the investigation of "Zerkalo Nedeli" newspaper, the reason for the embargo of Ukrainian production is pressure on the Ukrainian government to disrupt the signing of association agreement with the EU, scheduled to sign at the November 2013, Vilnius Summit. The newspaper describes the events as opening of the first front of "economic war" against Ukraine. This is indicated in the investigation that Russia wants to maintain its influence over Ukraine.


### Opinions of experts and politicians

* Ukrainian political scientist, political strategist, analyst and director of the Institute of Global Strategies Vadim Karasyov said:

> Reason for such actions of Russia is Ukraine's intent to sign Association Agreement and Free Trade Area Agreement with the European Union. That is European integration to EU. Thats why Russia if not to disrupt then to complicate process of signing of Association Agreement between Ukraine and EU at the Vilnius Summit of Eastern Partnership in November of 2013 starts total economic embargo of Ukraine instead of local temporary trade conflicts.

## Effects

According to the Federation of Employers of Ukraine in the beginning of the embargo the loss for Ukraine from the Russia's actions can reach $2â€“2,5 billion in the second half of 2013.

According to Ukrainian experts as for 22 August 2013 the 10-days embargo on the Russian border can hit some manufacturers, but the scale of losses in whole Ukraine is only â‚´500 million. Experts also believe that the unpredictable behaviour of Russia will force Ukrainian businessmen to seek new markets for their products, as well as make supporters of joining the "Customs Union" change their mind.

On 24 August 2013 on Radio "Liberty" MP of European Parliament Pawel Kowal published an article in which he suggested that the situation of tension in relations between Ukraine and Russia is just the beginning of the pressure that will continue and increase.

Sociologist, Director of "Democratic initiatives" Irina Bekeshkina said that Ukraine at the end of August 2013 is winning information war with Russia. However, according to experts, Russia will enhance the information and economic impact on Ukraine. Senior Advisor to the Russian Embassy in Ukraine Igor Sevastiyanov indirectly confirmed this statement, saying this embargo is "training".

Also, according to Radio "Liberty" with reference to the heads of the companies in the end of August 2013 it was reported that some Ukrainian companies through the trade confrontation between Ukraine and Russia are shifting to other markets. Some companies do not feel any problems with exports.

Representatives of EU said they are ready to introduce additional steps to support Ukraine - from simplification of visa for Ukraine to financial help. Also, EU thinks about complication of access to European market for Russian goods.
