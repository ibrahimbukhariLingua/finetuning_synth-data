## History

Nufarm was established in Melbourne, Australia during the mid 1950s by Max Fremder. He began selling phenoxy herbicides to professional spray applicators in regional Victoria.

Between the mid 1980s and early 2000s, Nufarm was a subsidiary of New Zealand-based Fernz Corporation. The Nufarm crop protection business continued to grow and expand during that period, with several overseas locations established throughout the 1990s.

In 2000, Fernz migrated the incorporation of the company from New Zealand to Australia and in the process changed the group's name to Nufarm Limited. Since that time, the company has focused on building a global platform for its core crop protection business and has divested various industrial and specialty chemical businesses.

Various acquisitions and solid organic growth have seen the business rapidly expand. Nufarm is now ranked the 9th largest crop protection company in the world, with a clear leadership position in Australia and substantial operations in North and South America, Europe, New Zealand and Asia.

On 30 September 2019 Nufarm announced the sale of all its South American crop protection and seed treatment operations to Sumitomo Chemical for $1,188 million.
