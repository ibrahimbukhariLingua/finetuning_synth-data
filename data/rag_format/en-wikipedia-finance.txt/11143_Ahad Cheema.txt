## Controversies


### Ashiana Housing Scheme

In 2018, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) arrested Cheema on charges related to irregularities in the Ashiana Housing Scheme project during his time as chairman of the LDA. The investigation also involved former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's principal secretary Fawad Hassan Fawad and Shehbaz Sharif.

### Aitchison Principal's Resignation

On March 25, 2024, Michael A. Thompson, the Australian principal of Aitchison College, resigned, citing interference by the Governor's House in college administration. Reports suggest his resignation was influenced by a dispute over fee waivers, involving Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman granting leave and a three-year fee waiver to the sons of Cheema.

In June 2022, Cheema's wife, a civil servant, requested a fee waiver for their sons due to her transfer to Islamabad. She sought a leave of absence, but the principal denied the fee waiver, citing policy. Governor Rehman intervened on March 21, 2024, granting the sons a leave of absence with a full fee waiver, sparking the principal's resignation and raising concerns about political interference in the college's administration.
