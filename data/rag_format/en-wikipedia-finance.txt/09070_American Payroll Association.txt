PayrollOrg was founded in 1982 and is headquartered in San Antonio, Texas with an additional office in Las Vegas. In addition, PAYO owns and operates a learning center at MEET Las Vegas. The Learning Center offer payroll training, focusing on the latest technology and computer networking capabilities.

The biggest of PAYO's educational offerings is its annual **Congress**. The event features guest speakers (including government officials and industry experts), a payroll and AP exhibit hall, and more than 100 workshops on topics related to payroll and accounts payable (AP). The Association also publishes a library of resource texts and newsletters for payroll professionals.

## Conferences

PAYO holds an annual Congress each May as well as smaller conferences throughout the year. Individual state conferences are organized independently by the PAYO's chapters.

PAYO's national conferences include:

* Payroll Congress is held in May, and is PAYO's largest educational conference, featuring over 200 workshops and an expo hall.
* Payroll Leaders Conference is held in September and provides next-level education for payroll leaders. Multiple speakers provide insights on a variety of topics.
* Educational Institutions Payroll Conference (EIPC) is held in October and focuses on compliance issues impacting payroll and tax professionals working in the higher education community.
* Capital Summit is held in March and focuses on new and developing issues in legislation and regulation that affect payroll operations.

## Government relations

PAYO participates in lobbying activities in Washington, D.C., and sponsors multiple member-lead committees called "Government Relations Task Force" committees. The committees cover areas such as the following: Child Support & Other Garnishments, Federal Tax Forms & Publications, Immigration, Payroll Cards, SSA Wage Reporting, and Unemployment Insurance. The purpose of these committees is to communicate the concerns of the payroll community to legislative and executive branches of government, and to find ways for employers to meet their requirements under law and support government objectives while minimizing administrative burden and cost for employers, government, and individual taxpayers.

In May 2008, IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman delivered an address to the attendees of PAYO's 2008 Congress highlighting the importance of the relationship between the IRS and PAYO, stating, "PayrollOrg has a long history of providing valuable advice and feedback to the IRS as we have implemented a number of important tax laws that have played a prominent role in the economic development of our nation."

Further example of PAYO's involvement with various government bodies is its contributions to publications such as the IRS/SSA Reporter. PAYO's Government Relations team frequently submits articles to the quarterly publication released by the IRS.

Additionally, PAYO's Government Relations staff has received SSA's Public Service Award for its ongoing dedication to improving the quality of employer wage and tax reporting and the IRS's Excellence in Partnering Award for its collaboration on clarifying employers' responsibilities and helping IRS educate employers. At IRS, PAYO is a founding member of the Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee and also has had representation on the IRS Advisory Council and the Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Committee.


## Publications and services
