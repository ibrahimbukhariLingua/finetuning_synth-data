Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic


# Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic



The **Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic** is a position in the Scottish cabinet since May 2024. The current Cabinet Secretary is Kate Forbes, who has served since May 2024 alongside her role as Deputy First Minister.

The Cabinet Secretary is supported by the Minister for Business, Richard Lochhead, and the Minister for Employment and Investment, Tom Arthur.


## History

The role was first titled **Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work**, with the initial holder being Keith Brown, who was appointed in May 2016. At its inception, the Cabinet Secretary had responsibilities for the Scottish economy, infrastructure, trade and investment, business, industry, employment, trade unions and energy. The Cabinet Secretary was assisted by the Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy and the Minister for Employability and Training.

The post was abolished in June 2018, with the "economy" part of the brief moving to the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work and the infrastructure responsibilities moving to the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity.

In February 2020, a **Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture** was appointed, taking over many of the responsibilities of the former portfolio, which were thus again held separately from the Finance brief. The role was later once again remerged with the Finance brief to create the **Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy**, held by Kate Forbes.

Under First Minister Humza Yousaf, Neil Gray was appointed as **Wellbeing Economy, Fair Work and Energy Secretary**, with the Finance brief again becoming a separate post. Following a reshuffle, Màiri McAllan held the portfolio of **Wellbeing Economy, Net Zero and Energy**.

In May 2024, John Swinney retitled the role to **Economy and Gaelic**, and appointed Kate Forbes concurrently with her role of Deputy First Minister of Scotland. McAllan retained the other part of her role as Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.
