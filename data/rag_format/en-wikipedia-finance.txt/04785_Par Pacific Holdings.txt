## Hawaii operations

On 19 December 2018, Par Pacific completed the $45 million sale from Island Energy Services (IES) of the 94,000-b/sd crude and vacuum distillation refinery known as *Par East* at the Campbell Industrial Park in Kapolei, Hawaii, and existing stocks of petroleum products. The Par East refinery at Kapolei is operated by Par Hawaii Refining, Inc., which is led by president Jimmy Yates and is a subsidiary of Par Pacific. Par Pacific expected to hire 20 additional employees along with 65 IES workers. IES will continue to own and maintain the Kapolei offshore mooring terminal and provide logistical support of petroleum products to Hawaii Electric Light Co., Maui Electric Co., Hawaiian Electric Co., and Kauai Island Utility Cooperative. According to IES CEO Jon Mauer in 2018, IES will continue to supply petroleum products to its existing 56 Texaco-branded stations from its current network of local and global suppliers and will bring on line additional stations including a new one in Kapolei.

During 2018, approximately eight cargoes of Minas crude from Riau in Sumatra, Indonesia were shipped to Hawaii through third parties on term offtake agreements with Indonesia's Pertamina or field operator PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI), but the shipments from Indonesia to the Kapolei Refinery were terminated under Par Pacific in 2019.

In March 2022, the Kapolei Refinery received about a quarter of its crude from Russia's Far East. Following the 8 March 2022 announcement by President Biden of a ban of Russian oil, liquified natural gas, and coal imported into the United States due to the invasion of Ukraine, Par Pacific announced that it would obtain non-Russian sources for its West Oahu oil refinery. Between August and December 2021, the refinery received one shipment of approximately 700,000 barrels from the Russian Far East. To replace the Russian sources, Par Pacific announced that it would source from North America and South America.
