# Schott Pharma



**Schott Pharma** (stylized as ***SCHOTT Pharma***) is a provider of drug containment solutions and delivery systems for injectable drugs. Originally a division of glass manufacturer Schott AG, the company went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2023. Headquartered in Mainz, Germany, the company operates in 14 countries.


## History

In 1887, Otto Schott developed borosilicate glass, a form of glassware used to reagent bottles and flasks. From 1911, Schott manufactured borosilicate glass tubing for the production of pharmaceutical ampoules and vials.

Schott Pharma was established as a standalone company in 2022 under the name *Schott Pharma AG & Co. KGaA* through an equity carve-out (or spin-off) from Schott AG, a manufacturer of specialty glass and glass-ceramics. In the same year, the company announced their plans to present an IPO, but this was reportedly postponed to 2023 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In June 2023, Schott Pharma announced plans to hold the IPO in September 2023. This plan was enacted in September, with Schott Pharma going public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The IPO was initially priced at 27€ per share, and a potential valuation of up to 4.1 billion euros, but increased the share price to 30€ the following day. The IPO was the largest of the year in Germany. In December 2023, Schott Pharma was included in the SDAX. In September 2024, Schott Pharma was promoted to the MDAX.
