# Moolala



**Moolala** is a Canadian personal finance training company founded in 2009 by business journalist *Bruce Sellery*.

Throughout Selleryâ€™s journalism career he interviewed thousands of people about money matters and learned one thing that almost everyone had in common; "smart people do dumb things with money." In response, Sellery developed Moolala, financial workshops and learning centres that teach capable people how to approach money in a smart way and have fun doing it.

Moolala delivers programs for corporations to teach employees how to improve their financial well-being, and challenges people to connect with money and have fun in the process.
