## History

The firm was founded in 1926 by Ira B. McGladrey (1883-1952) in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. McGladrey became a prominent figure in public accounting in Iowa, serving as President of the Iowa Society of Certified Public Accountants, chairman of the Iowa Board of Accountancy, as well as a member of the Rules Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the premier governing body for the field of accounting in the United States. The firm continued to operate under some variant of the McGladrey name until 2015.


### Legal structure

Beginning in 1999, through a partnership with H&R Block, McGladrey operated under two separate legal entities:

* McGladrey & Pullen, LLP
* RSM McGladrey, Inc.

McGladrey & Pullen operated under the traditional partnership structure and offered audit and attestation services. RSM McGladrey was established under the partnership agreement with H&R Block to provide tax and advisory services under an alternative practice structure.

In August 2011, H&R Block announced the conclusion of the partnership, divesting RSM McGladrey to McGladrey & Pullen and reuniting the firms in their traditional partnership structure. McGladrey & Pullen acquired all employees, assets, and infrastructure from RSM McGladrey. The deal closed on December 1, 2011.

On May 1, 2012, McGladrey & Pullen officially changed its name to McGladrey LLP. In July 2012, McGladrey shifted its headquarters from Bloomington, Minnesota to Chicago.

On October 26, 2015, McGladrey LLP changed its name to RSM US LLP as part of a worldwide rebranding of RSM International members.


## Controversies

In 2006, RSM settled a business fraud class action lawsuit against them for $41.5M.

In 2019, RSM was charged with violating auditor independence rules by the SEC. The charges were in connection with more than 100 audit reports involving at least 15 audit clients. RSM agreed to be censured and was fined $950,000.
