## History

Founded in San Francisco in 1863, Orrick earliest work included funding the Golden Gate Bridge construction, shaping the California Corporate Securities Act and the first offerings under the Securities Act of 1933, and litigating over hydroelectric power and water development rights in the Lake Tahoe region.

In the 1980s, the firm began expanding outside of the Bay Area, establishing offices in New York and Los Angeles. By the late 1990s, it opened its first international offices in Tokyo and London and Paris followed in 2002. Additionally, in 2002, Orrick opened its "Global Operations Center" in Wheeling, WV.

Orrick acquired 40 lawyers and their litigation practices from Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine in 1998.

In 2003, the firm added a team from the Venture Law Group (VLG). In 2005 at the expense of the now-defunct law firm Coudert Brothers Orrick expanded its London office and opened offices in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai with Coudert Brothers professionals.

In 2006, the firm engaged in merger negotiations with legacy Wall Street firm Dewey Ballantine; the merger was unsuccessful. The same year, Orrick expanded its Paris office through a combination with Rambaud Martel, a M&A and dispute resolution firm in France.
