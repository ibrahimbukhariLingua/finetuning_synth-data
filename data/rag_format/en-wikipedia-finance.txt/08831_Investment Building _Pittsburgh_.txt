Investment Building (Pittsburgh)


# Investment Building (Pittsburgh)



The **Investment Building** is a 1927 neo-classical skyscraper in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania which is located at 239 Fourth Avenue and part of the Fourth Avenue Historic District. The original name of the structure was the Insurance Exchange Building.


## History and architectural features

Designed by John M. Donn, a Washington, D.C. architect, the tower is of the same approximate fa√ßade dimensions as its 4th Avenue neighbors the Arrott Building and Benedum-Trees Building, both built a generation earlier. Built from limestone and a darker, more textured brick, the tower is noted for its simplicity and lightness of form and detailing. The roof corners feature chamfered obelisk-like elements.
