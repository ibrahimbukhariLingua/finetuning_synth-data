Tourist Resorts (Kerala)


# Tourist Resorts (Kerala)



**Tourist Resorts (Kerala) Ltd** or (**TRKL**) is a Government of Kerala undertaking under Kerala Tourism Department, established in August 1989 to promote tourism investment and to develop Tourism infrastructure in the Indian state of Kerala. TRKL was conceived to identify tourism infrastructure needs of the state and bridge any identified gaps. Kerala is today growing at an amazing pace in tourism, adhering to the principles of indigenousness, environmental sustainability and community participation. Kerala's beaches, hill stations, backwaters, wildlife sanctuaries, historical monuments, etc. attract foreign as well as domestic tourists.

The growth in Tourism Industry has also created an infrastructure gap in various tourism amenities, resulting in a disparity in supply and demand. TRKL is working towards creating various investment, development and partnership models to address this issue and to catalyse growth. To broaden its activities TRKL is reconstituted as Kerala Tourism Infrastructure and Investment Company Ltd by the Government of Kerala.
