## Organization

The organization is co-chaired by Ajay Banga and Blanca Trevino and led by Jonathan Fantini Porter. On February 23, 2023, Banga was nominated by President Joe Biden to lead the World Bank.


## Mission

The Partnership's stated mission is to reduce the root causes of poverty in Northern Central America to stem migration from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. To achieve this, the organization is mobilizing foreign direct investment and social investments to create one million new jobs and facilitate an enabling environment for investment through seven areas, including digital access, financial inclusion, job skilling, and women's empowerment. According to the website, their objectives include:

* Skill building for 250,000 individuals,
* Digital access for 5 million individual
* Financial inclusion for 11.5 million individuals
* Empowering 5 million women

## Programs

The Partnership has mobilized $3.2 billion in investments. It has focused on seven programs areas, including banking and financial inclusion, capital access, digital access, and job creation and skilling in business processes, production, and agriculture. In 2022, the Partnership was nominated for the P3 Impact Award, an award created by Concordia, the University of Virginia Darden School for Business, and the Office of Global Partnerships of the U.S. Department of State, as a leading Public Private Partnership model for bringing 450,000 individuals into the formal economy with Mastercard, connecting 4 million individuals with broadband access through Microsoft and Millicom; and $100 million in procurement contracts, including Nespresso sourcing the first coffee from Honduras


## Social Challenge

The Partnership's work is focused on addressing the root economic drivers of irregular migration from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to the United States, which is rooted in a complex mix of factors, including poverty and lack of economic opportunity, violence, weak governance and corruption, natural disasters, and a desire for family reunification. Of these challenges, poverty and lack of economic opportunity stand out as the leading driver for more than 74% of intended migrants.

A number of factors contribute to the challenge. Structural impediments and stagnant economic growth fail to create the number of quality formal jobs that the region's growing labor force requires. This is caused by low levels of foreign and domestic private sector investment; low labor productivity and a lack of skilled workers; high levels of labor informality; and challenges in promoting the rule of law, sound governance, and legal certainty. As a result, nearly 10 percent of the populations of Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala have left their homes in recent years.


## Recent Projects
