## History

The history of PPF dates back to the early 1990s. After the 1989 Velvet Revolution in what was then Czechoslovakia, the federal government led by prime minister Marián Čalfa decided to gradually privatise state-owned companies. A legal framework for privatisation was set down in Act No. 92/1991 passed on 26 February 1991. One of the agreed privatisation methods was voucher privatisation. Czechoslovak citizens who decided to take part in the voucher privatisation scheme had two options, to use their vouchers to either personally bid for shares in companies to be privatised or to exchange them for shares in privatisation funds, whose managers would then make the investment decisions.

In September 1991 PPF was founded as a Teplice-based company called *Správa **p**rvního **p**rivatizačního **f**ondu* (literally Management of the First Privatisation Fund). It registered capital was CSK 100,000 ($3,300). Petr Kellner became its chairman, and the other board members were managing director Milan Vinkler and Petr Joudal. All of three were already entrepreneurs. In February 1991 Kellner founded the company ANO with Joudal and the company WIKA with Vinkler.

To succeed in privatisation, PPF needed money for an advertising campaign, which it obtained from state-owned glassworks Sklo Union, also based in Teplice. Štěpán Popovič, board member of Sklo Union, formally introduced Kellner to the board, which in turn approved a CSK 20 million investment in the form of a capital increase and debt financing. In November 1991 the registered capital of PPF was increased to CSK 6.6 million ($226,000) and Joudal was replaced by Jaroslav Přerost, who was at the time CFO of Sklo Union.

In December 1991 PPF set up five investment funds:

| Name of the fund | Registered office | Board members (chairman first) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First Bohemian Privatisation Fund | Teplice | Přemysl Voráč, Petr Joudal, Ladislav Bartoníček |
| First Moravian-Silesian Privatisation Fund | Zlín | Petr Kellner, Radomír Zbožínek, Jiří Cajthaml |
| First North-Bohemian Privatisation Fund | Teplice | Petr Kellner, Milan Vinkler, Vladimír Klebsa |
| First South-Bohemian Privatisation Fund | České Budějovice | Vladimír Sochor, Radomír Zbožínek, Milan Skoumal |
| Regional Investment Fund | Liberec | Jiří Drda, Ladislav Bartoníček, Milan Vinkler |

The registered capital of each fund was CSK 100,000 ($3,300). PPF did not establish a fund focused on Slovakia.


### 1992–2000

In March 1992 the registered name of the management company was shortened to ***P**rvní **p**rivatizační **f**ond* (First Privatisation Fund), a month later an extraordinary general meeting elected Popovič to its board.

Following the advertising campaign at the outset of the first wave of voucher privatisation, PPF funds gathered 1.4% of all investment points and PPF became the eleventh-largest management company in terms of acquired privatisation points. In the second wave, which took place after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 31 December 1992, PPF funds gathered 2.1% of all investment points (ninth-largest group).

In 1994 shareholders of the four largest funds from the first wave agreed a merger, the smallest Regional Investment Fund was later liquidated. In 1996 the merged fund acquired a 20% stake in Česká pojišťovna (ČP), the largest Czech insurance company. ČP had a profitable insurance business, however its two subsidiary banks were losing billions of Czech crowns, decreasing the ownership equity of ČP.

On 17 June 1996 the first wave fund was transformed to a standard holding corporation (PPF IH). The transformation took place just two weeks before 1 July 1996, when the Act No. 142/1996 made the transition to a standard corporation much more complicated. As a result, PPF IH was no longer subject to the regulation of investment funds. To push the transformation through, PPF used cross-shareholdings. For example, the industrial company TMP, in which PPF was the largest shareholder, acquired in March 1996 shares of the fund, only to sell them for a lower price after the extraordinary general meeting losing CZK 96 million ($2.5 million).

On 19 June 1996 the Minister of Finance Ivan Kočárník hosted a key meeting of ČP shareholders, the state's National Property Fund (NPF), PPF, and three banks, IPB, ČSOB and KB. NPF, which held a 30% stake in ČP, was represented by the Minister of Privatization Roman Češka (of the party ODA), the governor of the Czech National Bank, Josef Tošovský was also present. It was agreed that PPF should manage ČP, and IPB would manage its ailing subsidiary banks. PPF and IPB also got an option to purchase ČSOB shares, subject to the condition that the audited ČP profit for 1997 was positive. In 1998 PPF and IPB exercised that option and the state lost its majority in ČP (the state was the largest shareholder in ČSOB and KB banks).

On 21 March 2000, Libor Procházka (IPB) agreed with Petr Kellner to sell ČP shares controlled by IPB to the Dutch-based company CESPO. The contractual penalty amounted to 75% of the purchase price (CZK 1.6 billion). IPB transferred the shares too late and therefore CESPO paid only 25% of the agreed price. As a result, PPF had a majority interest in ČP. IPB went into forced administration in June 2000 and was sold to ČSOB. ČSOB later took PPF to the court, claiming the price of ČP shares was too low, it lost the case.

In September 2000 the registered capital of PPF IH was decreased by 90% and CZK 1.77 billion ($45 million) was distributed among its shareholders (CZK 500 per share, meaning CZK 15,000 per voucher book).
