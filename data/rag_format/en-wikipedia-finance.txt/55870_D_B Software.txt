D&B Software


# D&B Software



**D&B Software** (Dun & Bradstreet Software Services) was formed by the merger of the Management Science America and McCormack & Dodge companies in June 1990, under the ownership of the Dun & Bradstreet corporation. In 1982, *McCormack & Dodge* was described by *The New York Times* as "one of the nation's top three financial software concerns."


## Overview

After the merger, the separate company headquarters, located in Massachusetts and Atlanta, were retained with videoconferencing used for communication. Originally, the merged company was a supplier of financial packages that ran on mainframe computers. In 1991, they released the client-server middleware application suite named SmartStream that ran on HP-UX. *Smartstream* 3.0 was introduced in early 1995.


## Geac

In 1996, D&B Software was acquired by the Canadian client-server application firm Geac Computer Corporation for US$150 million, who immediately split the services into two divisions.
