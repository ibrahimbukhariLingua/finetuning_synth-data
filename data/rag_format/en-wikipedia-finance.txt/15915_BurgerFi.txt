BurgerFi


# BurgerFi



**BurgerFi International, Inc.** (doing business as **BurgerFi**) is an American hamburger restaurant chain aimed at the "better burger" sector of the market. The first location was opened in February 2011 in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida.


## History

In 2015 a review in *USA Today* spoke of "... its upscaled statement with sleek modern restaurants giving just a hint of bar or coffeehouse atmosphere".

In 2017, the chain partnered with Beyond Meat and subsequently introduced a vegetarian/vegan burger patty called the "Beyond Burger".

In September 2024, BurgerFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.


### Food sourcing

In 2018, the Consumers Union graded the top 25 burger chains in the U.S. on their antibiotic use policies for beef. BurgerFi was one of the two chains that were given an "A" rating for using beef that was raised without routine use of antibiotics.


### Acquisition of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza

In November 2021, BurgerFi completed the acquisition of Florida-based pizza chain Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza, which has 61 locations in 8 US states as of June 2021.
