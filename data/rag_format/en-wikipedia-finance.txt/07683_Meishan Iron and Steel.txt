## History


### Meishan Iron & Steel

The steel plant at Meishan Iron Mine [zh], in Yuhuatai District, Nanjing was founded in 1969 by the Shanghai Government. The mine became a quasi-exclave of Shanghai. In 1984, the steel plant and related industries became **Shanghai Meishan Metallurgical Corporation** (Chinese: 上海梅山冶金公司). The company was registered in the Government of Nanjing in 1990.

In 1994, a new holding company was formed for Meishan Group, which the mine was spin-off from Meishan Metallurgical Corporation in 1995, while the iron and steel company became **Shanghai Meishan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd.** (Chinese: 梅山钢铁有限公司).

The company became a subsidiary of Baosteel Group in 1998. Meishan Iron and Steel was listed as one of the 512 most important state-owned enterprises in 1997, in the iron and steel industry segment that consist of 47 companies.

The company was re-incorporated in 2001 (Chinese: 上海梅山钢铁股份有限公司) by debt-to-equity swap. In 2004, Baosteel Group floated Meishan Iron & Steel at Shanghai Stock Exchange by selling 74.01% shares of Meishan Iron & Steel to its listed subsidiary Baoshan Iron and Steel, for a valuation of CN¥5.469 billion (CN¥7.389 billion total value times 74.01% shares). The deal was completed in 2005.

In 2008, Meishan Iron & Steel signed a contract with Praxair to build two more new air separation plants in Meishan.

In 2018, it was announced that the steel plant of the company would be relocated to Yancheng, Jiangsu Province in the 2020s.
