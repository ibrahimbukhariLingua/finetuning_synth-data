# Lone Pine Capital



**Lone Pine Capital** is an American-based hedge fund and investment advisor headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. The firm has offices in London, New York City, and San Francisco.


## History

Lone Pine Capital was established in 1997 by its president and portfolio manager, Stephen Mandel. The firm was named after a pine tree on the Dartmouth College campus that survived a lightning strike in 1887.

Mandel previously worked for Julian Robertson at the firm Tiger Management, making Lone Pine one of the 30 or more so-called "Tiger Cubs", funds founded by managers who started their investment careers with Tiger Management. Mandel led the firm until January 2019, when he stepped back from day-to-day activity into a mentorship role with less investment oversight.

As of August 2023, Lone Pine Capital reported $15.2 billion under management.


## Investment strategy

Lone Pine Capital's investment vehicles include the Lone Cypress hedge fund, its flagship fund, and its long-only Lone Cascade strategy. As of 2024, the Cascade strategy held a majority of the firm's assets.

Between 2021 and 2023, the firm shifted its focus to investments in publicly traded companies, but resumed private investments in April 2024 when it acquired a minority stake in Canva and Spotnana Technology.
