**Dubai Pearl** (Arabic: لؤلؤة دبي) was a 73-storey, 300 m (984 ft), tall residential skyscraper project situated along Al Sufouh Road in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The project was first announced in 2002. Construction was on hold from 2006 to 2022. As per reports, demolition work is ongoing at the site as of January 23rd, 2023. The building would have consisted of four mixed-use towers connected together at the base and by a sky bridge at the top. The structural design was carried out by the Dubai-based engineering firm e-Construct, and the project would have cost $4 billion (Dh14.6 billion). Had it been completed, Dubai Pearl would have accommodated 9,000 residents and its commercial sector would have employed 12,000 people.


## Investment issues

Dubai Pearl was initially launched by Omnix Group in 2002. The project was then acquired by Tecom Group in 2007 and sold to Abu Dhabi Al-Fahim Group later that year, but progress stalled on the project since then. In 2014, Hong Kong-based Chow Tai Fook Endowment Industry Investment Development (CTFE) reportedly bought a $1.9bn share of the project, promising to restart the project later that year, though that never happened.


## Demolition and redevelopment proposals

In July 2016, some witnesses reported on Twitter, showing images of the construction cranes on the project site being removed, and the complex remains abandoned.

Canadian businessman Michael Henderson has proposed Project Moon, a 900-foot (270 m) replica of the Moon paid for by Moon World Resorts Inc., which he co-founded. To be located on top of a circular 100-foot (30 m) building, it would include a 4000-room hotel and an area seating 10,000, and possibly a casino, and would give people the experience that simulates walking on the Moon. It would be lighted at night and the amount of light could vary, as with phases of the Moon.
