**Stanley S. Surrey** (October 3, 1910 â€“ August 27, 1984) was a United States tax law scholar known as "a dean of the academic tax bar" and "the greatest tax scholar of his generation". Among his notable contributions to the field was the phrase "tax expenditure", which he coined in a 1967 speech to refer to tax breaks that serve as government subsidies unrelated to attempts to accurately measure the tax base.
