# TM Technologies (company)



**TM Technologies (TMT)** is an American communications technology company established in 2013. The company offers software tools and firmware through Transpositional Modulation (TM) to improve the bandwidth speed of wired and wireless networks.


## Overview

TM Technologies was founded by Dan Hodges in 2013. Previously, it began as a spinoff and an R&D lab of Medusa Scientific. Later, it was established as a separate company in 2013. Since its inception, Dan Hodges has been serving as its CEO.

The company further developed the Transpositional Modulation (TM) technology and commercialized it in higher frequencies for telecom integration in 2021.

In 2021, TM Technologies introduced its Transposition Modulation technology for digital use. In the following year, the company started using Transpositional Modulation technology for operating over the standard waveforms of 4G and 5G, OFDM. TM Technologies partnered with Quantum Resistant Cryptography to improve the speed and security of 5G and 6G satellites in 2024.


### Product and services

The company provides software tools and firmware for improving bandwidth capacity, data speed, and obfuscation of wired and wireless networks through Transpositional Modulation (TM) technology. The technology is used in different industries, including telecommunications, satellite, IoT, defense & aerospace, and broadcasting & multimedia. The Transpositional Modulation technology was developed by TMT, and it consists of three primary technologies, which are as follows:

* Cognitive Spectrum Optimization (CSO) – This method allocates spectrum resources in wireless communication based on changing network conditions and user demands. CSO enhances spectrum utilization efficiency by employing spectrum sensing, sharing, and mobility techniques. By managing spectrum resources, CSO technology can improve network performance and capacity while minimizing interference.[
* In-Band-Full-Duplex (IBFD) – A TM technology that enables simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency band. It allows a device to transmit and receive data at the same time, potentially doubling the spectral efficiency. IBFD relies on signal processing techniques to moderate self-interference caused by simultaneous transmission and reception. By overcoming traditional limitations of half-duplex communication, IBFD is used to improve throughput and capacity in wireless networks.
* Near Field Communications (NFC) – It is a short-range wireless communication technology enabled by inductive connections between devices. The technology can operate within a few centimeters and support data exchange for different NFC applications. TM Technologies offers a wideband NFC methodology exceeding 100 Mb/sec, utilizing Transpositional Modulation (TM) for secure encrypted communications. Its low-power nature and proximity security make it resistant to remote hacking.
