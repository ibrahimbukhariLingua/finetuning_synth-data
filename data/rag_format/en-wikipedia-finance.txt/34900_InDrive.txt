# InDrive



**inDrive** (previously known as **inDriver**), is an international ride-hailing service with more than 200 million downloads operating in more that 700 cities in over 45 countries. Headquartered in Mountain View, California, it is the second largest ridesharing and taxi app worldwide by downloads. The company was officially launched in 2013.

It is one of the fastest growing international passenger transport services operating on the peer-to-peer pricing model. In the inDrive app, all conditions of the trip are determined as a result of an agreement between passengers and drivers. inDrive works both in small towns with a population of 10 thousand inhabitants, often with weak internet and without maps of the settlement, and in the largest cities with the highest level of competition. According to OZY, the fees that inDrive takes from drivers' receipts average 5–8% of the fare, which is significantly less than other major ride-hailing services. inDrive takes 12.99% of the fare in commission. Passengers make all payments for rides directly to drivers in cash or non-cash settlements . The inDrive mobile app is available on Android and iOS.


## History

inDriver was founded in 2012 in Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world. The service originated when a group of local students established a collective group of "independent drivers" (i.e. inDrivers) on social media in response to a sharp increase in taxi prices when outside temperatures dropped precipitously. Members of the group shared where they wanted to go and the prices they were willing to pay, allowing drivers to in turn contact these customers and negotiate prices. One year later, the group moved to the Sinet Company which created a peer-to-peer transportation-based system based on this concept.

In 2013, inDriver was officially launched.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inDrive divested its interests in the Russian market in June 2022, and relocated 1,000 employees from Russia to Kazakhstan and Cyprus.

inDrive subsequently launched other services, including intercity trips, couriers, freight delivery, and inDrive.Services, which allows people to find service providers in a wide range of fields. inDrive.Services is available in Egypt, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil.
