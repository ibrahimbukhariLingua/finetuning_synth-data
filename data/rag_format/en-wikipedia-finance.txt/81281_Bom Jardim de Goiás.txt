## History

Before European exploration this region was inhabited by the Bororó Indians. In the middle of the nineteenth century Manoel Perdigão discovered gold at a place called Buriti on the banks of the Macacos River. In 1912 the Felizardo family arrived and began a farm called Bom Jardim. A chapel was built in 1914 and Dona Ana Rufina de Faria donated lands for a future town. In 1924 Bom Jardim was elevated to the category of district in the municipality of Rio Bonito, which is present-day Caiapônia. In 1943 the name was changed to Ibotim, of unknown origin, and in 1953 it became a municipality, with the new name of Bom Jardim de Goiás.
