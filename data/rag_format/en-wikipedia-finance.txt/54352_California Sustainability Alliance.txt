# California Sustainability Alliance



**CALIFORNIA SUSTAINABILITY ALLIANCE**

The **California Sustainability Alliance** is an organization founded by the California IOUs, to facilitated discussions between various industries on the issues of resource sustainability. The Alliance was set up in 2008 to help California meet its goals in facing Climate change in the State, in relation to energy, resources, and the environment. Efforts are directed at increasing and accelerating sustainable measures and strategies. The Alliance specifically focuses on energy efficiency, climate action, “smart growth” principles, renewable energy development, water-use efficiency, waste management, and transportation management within California.


## Function

The Alliance's main functions include sharing and developing toolkits, resources and pilot programs that aid in the planning and implementation of sustainability initiatives within California. These tools and resources include:

* California Local Energy Efficiency Program (CALeep): Designed to help California's local governments plan and implement highly effective energy efficiency initiatives in their communities.
* Emerald California Pilot Program: Emerald Cities is designed to help local governments adopt ‘reach goals’ that go beyond simply complying with State environmental mandates, and implement sustainability programs that support California's environmental priorities. The Alliance is the lead implementer of this California Department of Conservation pilot program.
* Green General Plan Toolkit: Recognizes five key sustainability principles that local governments may wish to consider in developing their green general plans: strategic emissions reduction, smart land use & planning, responsible resource use, integrated transportation, and innovative waste management.
* Green Leases Toolkit: This toolkit supports tenants and landlords in developing their own green leasing policies and requirements; measuring and comparing the green attributes of different buildings, developing specific lease language and communicating policies and requirements to the market.
* Green Tenant Guide: This guide helps organizations learn how to work with their staff to set clear and feasible sustainability goals, establish buy-in and excitement, define metrics, and measure and communicate results.
* Local Government Green Procurement Guide: A guidebook to help local governments adopt an environmentally friendly procurement purchasing plan. This guidebook provides local government staff and decision-makers with a variety of tools and resources to help them implement green purchasing programs.
* Local Government Operations Protocol Toolkit: A tool for accounting and reporting Greenhouse gas emissions across a local government's operations. It was adopted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in September 2008 for local governments to develop and report consistent and accurate GHG inventories and to help meet California's AB 32 GHG reduction obligations.
* Local Government Resources Toolkit: This resource helps cities and counties identify and locate tools and funding sources to help their communities set and meet sustainability goals.
