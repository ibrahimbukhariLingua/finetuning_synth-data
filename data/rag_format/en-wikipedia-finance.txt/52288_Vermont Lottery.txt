Vermont Lottery


# Vermont Lottery



The **Vermont Lottery** began fiscal operations as an enterprise fund in October 1977, following a 1976 referendum, and the enactment of Public Act No. 82 by the 1977 General Assembly. It is run by the Vermont Lottery Commission, which is headquartered in Berlin. Along with Maine and New Hampshire, Vermont is a member of the Tri-State Lottery.

## Current Draw games


### In-House Tri-State Lottery Commission draw games


#### Pick 3 & Pick 4

Pick 3 and Pick 4 are drawn twice daily including Sundays. Prizes and options vary.


#### Megabucks

Megabucks Plus replaced *Megabucks* in July 2009; it also uses a 5+1 double matrix. The game draws 5 balls from 1 through 41, plus a megaball from 1 through 6. Games cost $2; minimum jackpot is $1,000,000. Drawings are Wednesdays and Saturdays. In the late 2010s somewhere, the name of the game's switched back as Megabucks.


#### Gimme5

On May 12, 2013, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont began *Gimme5*, with a top prize of $100,000 cash, to be split if there are multiple winners. Drawings are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.


### Multi-jurisdictional draw games


#### Lucky for Life

In 2009, the Connecticut Lottery began an in-house game, *Lucky4Lífe*, which became a regional game three years later, and became *Lucky for Life*. (Its drawings remain in Connecticut.) The top prize is $1,000-per-day for life; multiple winners split the prize.

On September 17, 2013, *Lucky for Life* was revamped; changes include a $25,000-per-year second prize. Winners of either annuitized prize level are allowed to choose cash in lieu of the lifetime annuity, unlike the top prize in the previous versions.

In January 2015, *Lucky for Life* became a "quasi-national" game. Players now choose 5 of 48 white balls and a green "Lucky Ball" numbered 01 through 18. As of April 2017, the game is offered in 22 states and the District of Columbia, with three more states expected to join.


#### Mega Millions

In October 2009, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball in American lotteries wishing to offer both games. The Vermont Lottery added Mega Millions on January 31, 2010, the cross-selling expansion day.

The current version of Mega Millions (drawn Tuesdays and Fridays) began on October 28, 2017; its jackpot starts at $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. Players choose 5 of 70 "white ball" numbers, and a gold-colored "Mega Ball"; the latter is numbered 1 through 25. For an extra $2. a player can activate the "Megaplier" option, which multiplies non-jackpot winnings by up to 5.


#### Powerball

In 2003, the Vermont Lottery added Powerball, which began in 1992. Jackpots begin at $40 million; the game is drawn Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.

As of April 2017, Vermont has yet to sell a jackpot-winning ticket for either Mega Millions or Powerball.
