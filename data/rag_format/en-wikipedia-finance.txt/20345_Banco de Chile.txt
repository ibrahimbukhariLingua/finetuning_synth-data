## Controversies


### US money laundering

In 2005, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) removed the General Manager of Banco de Chile - New York from the United States banking industry and imposed a $200,000 civil money penalty against the individual for engaging in unsafe banking practices, related to his involvement in accounts owned or controlled by the prominent politically exposed person and his associates. In addition, Banco de Chile-New York and Banco de Chile-Miami failed to timely respond to widely publicized reports of alleged criminal activity by this high-profile Chilean politically exposed person (PEP) and failed to gather and analyze information from applicable accounts in order to assess the potential for suspicious activity. The OCC issued a Cease and desist against Banco de Chile for Bank Secrecy Act violations. The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also levied a $3 million penalty on Banco de Chile for not identifying, monitoring and reporting suspicious activity related to a Chilean politically exposed person, his family and associates doing business in its New York and Miami branches. The high-profile Chilean PEP was confirmed to be Augusto Pinochet, the retired former dictator of the country who came to power in a military coup.


### Pinochet funds

In 2009, Banco de Chile was one of four banks sued by the Chilean government for negligently or deliberately helping former dictator Augusto Pinochet hide $26 million in stolen funds. The other banks were PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Banco Santander, Espirito Santo Bank. "The Chilean government may have chosen to go after the four banks specifically because the documented evidence of negligence or willful blindness was stronger," said Michael Díaz, managing partner with law firm Díaz Reus & Targ LLP in Miami, adding that the other institutions may be “on the periphery of liability.”
