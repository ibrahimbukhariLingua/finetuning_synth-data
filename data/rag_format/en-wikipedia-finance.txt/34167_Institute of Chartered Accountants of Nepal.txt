## Controversies


### Tax exemption controversy

Two practising chartered accountants, Lumba Dhwaj Mahat and Umesh Prasad Dhakal, were involved in misappropriating state tax revenue through dubious tax settlements as Chairman and Member of Tax Settlement Commission involving Chudamani Sharma, Director General of Inland Revenue Department (Nepal). The corruption scam was considered as one of the biggest in the Nepalese history. ICAN disciplinary committee failed to take any action against the two accused CAs. Vice-Chairman Jagannath Upadhyay Niraula said that "the disciplinary committee can take action only after receiving information or the complaint is lodged against any chartered accountant. We have not received any complaint against the duo." The fraud amounted to NRs. 21 billion. Both the CAs have fled from the incident and were declared fugitive by Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority.
