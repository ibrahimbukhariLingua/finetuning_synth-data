Clinicians can choose to participate in the Quality Payment Program through the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (APMs).

In 2026, the conversion factor for both programs will be set at 0.75%.

The Government Accountability Office in partnership with DHHS is set to assist in the implementation of nationwide electronic health records (EHR), while simultaneously comparing and recommending such programs for providers; the EHR goal is set for December 31, 2018 under MACRA.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
