Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986


# Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986



The **Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986** (c. 3) is an act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. The effect of the Act was to put the finances of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) on a trading fund basis, such that what the Authority charged its customers included an element of profit.

The act received royal assent on 19 February 1986.


## Rationale

In 1984 the Secretary of State for Energy instigated a review of the UKAEA. This established that about half of the UKAEA's annual expenditure of £400 million was grant-in-aid from the Department of Energy. The remainder was from contract work from the electricity supply industry, BNFL and others. The review recommended that the Authority should be operated on a fully commercial basis and that more work should be funded by the nuclear industry. The Act made the net assets of the Authority a debt due to the Secretary of State. The Authority was empowered to borrow up to £150 million, or £200 million with the consent of the Secretary of State.


## Provisions

The act comprised ten sections in three parts:

**The authority's finances**
