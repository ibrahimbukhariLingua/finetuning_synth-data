# EPAS



**EPAS** (*Electronic Protocols Application Software*) was a European non-commercial cooperation initiative which developing a series of data protocols to be applied in a point of sale (POS) environment. This included the protocols used by payment terminals and card payment systems. The project focused on three protocols; a terminal management protocol, a retailer application protocol and an acquirer protocol.

In 2024, EPAS was merged with two other organizations to create Nexo Specifications.


## History

The organization was launched in 2005, and took over some of the work done on payment terminal standards in Germany by the Open Payment Initiative.

The initiative was structured along three following main phases:

* Phase I : development of technical specifications and issuance of standards (2006 - mid-2007)
* Phase II : development of software and provision of test tools (2007 – 2008)
* Phase III : construction of demonstrators (2008)

In 2012, it was merged with the OSCar consortium and the CIR SEPA-Fast technical working group to create a global standards organization called Nexo Standards.
