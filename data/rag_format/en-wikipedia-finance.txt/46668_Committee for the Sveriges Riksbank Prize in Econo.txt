Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel


# Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel



The **Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel** is the prize committee for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, and fills the same role as the Nobel Committees do for the Nobel Prizes. This means that the committee is responsible for proposing laureates for the prize. The Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is appointed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It usually consists of Swedish professors of economics or related subjects who are members of the academy, although the academy in principle could appoint anyone to the committee. Two of the members of the founding committee as well as later members of the committee had also been associated with the Mont Pelerin Society.

The committee is a working body without decision power, and the final decision to award the prize is taken by the entire Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, after having a first discussion in the academy's Class for Social Sciences.
