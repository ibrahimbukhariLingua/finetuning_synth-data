## History

The Brooker Group was founded in 1994 by Chan Bulakul of the Bulakul family in Thailand. In the late 1990s, it focused on restructuring and distressed assets advisory and investments across Southeast Asia as a result of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, advising family owned businesses across Southeast Asia on how to navigate through the crisis. As a result, the majority of its clients today are HNWIs (High Net-Worth Individuals) who invest in alternative assets globally.

The Company later became the first Southeast Asian entity to be listed on the MAI (Market for Alternative Investments) exchange in 2001 and developed a reputation as an expert in alternative assets.

In 2016, The Brooker Group was named on Forbes' "Asia's Best Under a Billion" list.

The Brooker Group's founder started the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) Chapter for Thailand.
