Blue Creek Wind Farm


# Blue Creek Wind Farm



The **Blue Creek Wind Farm** spanning Paulding and Van Wert County became the largest wind farm in the U.S. state of Ohio at approximately 40,500 acres upon its completion in 2012. With a generating capacity of 304 megawatts (MW), it produces enough electricity to service the equivalent of about 76,000 homes. It was the largest private investment in the state in 2011, with the construction alone directly employing about 500 workers. The annual land lease payments, operations and maintenance employment, and property and income tax revenues provide an ongoing stimulus to the local rural economy.
