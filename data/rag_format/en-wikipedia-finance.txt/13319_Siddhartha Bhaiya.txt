## Mirror trading controversy

Siddhartha Bhaiya had alleged that a broker engaged in mirror trading while executing trades for the fund. Mirror trading involves replicating real-time trades executed by another individual. In 2023, a complaint was lodged with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), alleging front running. Following the complaint, SEBI initiated an investigation. The accused broker opted for a settlement that included a fee of 45.99 lakh. SEBI's order on July 5 concluded that while front-running wasn't substantiated, the broker's actions violated specific provisions of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) Regulations.
