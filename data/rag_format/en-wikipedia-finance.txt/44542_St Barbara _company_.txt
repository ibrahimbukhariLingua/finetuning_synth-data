**St Barbara Limited** is an Australian-based, Australian Securities Exchange-listed (ASX) gold producer and explorer.


## History

The company was incorporated and listed in 1969 as Endeavour Oil and initially focused on mineral exploration and production from assets located in Western Australia. In 2005, the company acquired the Southern Cross, Leonora and South Laverton gold assets from Sons of Gwalia Limited. St Barbara's high-grade Gwalia Gold Mine at Leonora was commissioned in October 2008.

In 2012, St Barbara acquired Allied Gold Mining Plc and its gold operations at Simberi in Papua New Guinea and Gold Ridge in the Solomon Islands. Operations at Gold Ridge in the Solomon Islands were suspended in April 2014 due to torrential rainfall and ensuing flooding. The Gold Ridge Project was sold to a Solomon Islands company associated with local landowners in May 2015.

In May 2019, St Barbara bought Canadian Atlantic Gold Corp for Can$722 million ($536 million), adding a mine in Canada.
