# Orgalim

Orgalim is registered under the European Union Transparency Register operated jointly by the European Commission and the European Parliament – ID number: 20210641335-88.


## History

Orgalim was formally created in late 1954, therefore pre-dating the official European Union project. Founding associations came from Austria, Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. Meetings and informal collaboration between industries had begun in 1948, and although initially created as an informal club without any financial demands, the organisation became increasingly structured and eventually developed a secretariat in the early 1950s. Various other engineering groups had been created at the same time as the European Coal and Steel Community developed, such as MEFTA and COLIME. Orgalim members decided in 1960 to incorporate the groups into Orgalim as working groups.
