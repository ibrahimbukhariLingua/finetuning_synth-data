## History

ComplyAdvantage was founded in London, United Kingdom, in 2014 by Charles Delingpole. The company was initially set up as a RegTech solutions provider for businesses to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements. Prior to this, in 2002, Delingpole founded The Student Room, an online community for students based in the United Kingdom. He sold the company in 2006 and then founded MarketFinance, a FinTech company, alongside Anil Stocker and Ilya Kondrashov, in 2011.

The company has acquired a total of $88.2 million through three series of venture capital funding. In October 2016, the company raised $8.2 million Series A funding. It then raised $30 million in Series B and $50 million in Series C in January 2019 and July 2020, respectively. The funding rounds were led by Balderton Capital, Index Ventures, and Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan board.

In 2019, ComplyAdvantage received the Best RegTech Solution award at Finovate. The company was named a Technology Pioneer by World Economic Forum in 2020. It was ranked 87th on Financial Times list of Europe's 1000 fastest growing companies.

ComplyAdvantage was one of six British FinTech companies chosen by the Department of International Trade (DIT) for its third mission to Finnosummit, an international financial technology conference that takes place in Latin America.

In 2022, Vatsa Narasimha was promoted to the position of CEO with Charles Delingpole moving to the role of Executive Chairman.

In 2024, ComplyAdvantage acquired knowledge graph startup Golden Recursion Inc.
