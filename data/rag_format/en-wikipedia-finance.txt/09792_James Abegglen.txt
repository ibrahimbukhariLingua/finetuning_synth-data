* *Seniority-based wages*: Compensation is determined by the number of years of employment in the company
* *Periodic hiring*: Employing young people fresh out of school
* *In-company training*: Employing workers based on personal qualities rather than job suitability, providing on-the-job training after hire
* *Enterprise union*: one labour union for each enterprise
