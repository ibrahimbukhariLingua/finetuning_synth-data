## History

Established in March 1988, conference started out as a consultation meeting on Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for the representatives of Slovenian organizations. The meeting was initiated by Jože Gričar and organized by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia in Ljubljana. The Second consultation meeting on EDI was held in Bled, which later becomes a traditional venue of the event, and it was open to the broader public. 120 representatives from companies, banks and government attended the meeting to hear 19 submissions and see a live demonstration of a prototype solution for the electronic order exchange. The conference had opened for international participants in its third year, adding participants from USA, Austria, Japan and Poland to the program. In 1991 the consultation meeting grows into The International Electronic Data Interchange Conference with 260 participants from 15 countries and 56 research papers.

Conference edited its name again in 1993, adding Interorganizational Systems (IOS) to it. As the development trends indicated in 1997 the terms EDI and IOS in the conference's name were substituted with the term Electronic Commerce, also the conference recognized Bled as its traditional venue (10th Bled Electronic Commerce Conference). The last change to the conference's name was made in 2005, when the conference was renamed Bled eConference due to the broader research field presented at the conference each year.
