# Astaldi



**Astaldi S.p.A.** is an Italian multinational major construction company based in Rome. The group is active in the fields of civil engineering, hydraulic engineering, electromechanical engineering and transportation.

Significant subsidiaries include Astaldi Concessioni, NBI, Astaldi Construction Corp, NBI, and TEQ Construction Enterprise.


## History

The company was founded in 1929 by Sante Astaldi, and a member of the Astaldi family remains on the company's board. Astaldi was involved in many major European civil works projects pre-World War II, including the Rome–Naples railway. After the war, the company extended its activities to Africa, where it focused on road construction. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, Astaldi's presence was introduced to the Middle East, Central and South America, and the Far East. The company split into Impresa Astaldi Estero S.p.A. (for foreign markets) and Impresa Astaldi Estero S.p.A. (for Italian projects) in 1950 but merged to form the present-day Astaldi S.p.A. in the 1980s. Astaldi continued to diversify its projects, entering new markets in the United States, Turkey and Indonesia throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

The Canadian portion of the company attempted to build a power station at Muskrat Falls in Labrador, Canada in 2016 without having a structural engineering permit to work on such a project. The company was deemed "professionally incompetent". In November 2020, Webuild acquired a 65% shareholding in Astaldi.
