The J.G. Crawford Prize was established by ANU in 1973, as Crawford was ending his term as vice-chancellor, in recognition of his contribution to the university. PhD Graduate students are nominated by college deans, and two (one for the natural sciences and one for social sciences/ humanities) and occasionally a third (for interdisciplinary work) are selected on the basis of academic excellence by a committee.

Since mid-2013 and as of July 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the ANU is undertaking a research project with the title "J.G. Crawford: Shaping Australia's Place in the World".

A biography will be written by historian Nicholas Brown, while Frank Bongiorno is also involved in the project.
