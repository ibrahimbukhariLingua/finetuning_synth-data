## History

Semrush was first released as Seodigger before becoming an extension of Firefox, then renamed SeoQuake Company in 2007, before landing on SEMrush (the acronym SEM stands for Search engine marketing).

In April 2018, the company received $40 million in funding as part of a financing transaction co-led by venture capital firms Greycroft, E.ventures and Siguler Guff, in preparation for its expansion into various platforms of research, including those owned by Amazon, Microsoft, and Baidu.

In December 2020, the company rebranded with a new visual identity, updating its name from "SEMrush" to "Semrush".

In March 2021, Semrush had an initial public offering and went public on NYSE under the symbol NYSE: SEMR. The S-1 form revealed that the company had sales of $213 million and more than 82,000 customers.

Semrush's founders are Russian, and relocated to the US in 2017. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the company ceased all operations in Russia and offered relocation to Russian-based staff to other European countries.

In June 2022, the company launched a beta tool for content generation called *Content Outline Builder*. The tool will suggest ideas for article writing and blog posts. Semrush also announced on June 27, 2022, that their Backlinks insights data is now integrated with SurferSEO, a marketing tool focused on content creation.
