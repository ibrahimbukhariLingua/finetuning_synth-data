**Carl Abegg** known as **Carl Abegg-Arter** (10 April 1836 – 23 August 1912) was a Swiss businessman, merchant and founder of Abegg & Co, a leading silk merchant firm, based in Zurich. Abegg has been widely considered the richest Swiss citizen at the time.


## Early life and education

Abegg was born 10 April 1836 in Küsnacht, Switzerland, the second of three children, to Johann "Hans" Caspar Abegg (1803–1850), a cloth merchant, and Anna Regula Abegg (née Bleuler; 1815–1857). He had an older brother who died only aged one month and a younger sister, Lina Niederer (née Abegg 1840–1868).

He completed the Industrial School of Zürich, where he completed his Matura. Between 1852 and 1855, he was sent to Milan, Italian Empire, where he learned the silk trading business in an apprenticeship at the company *Heinrich Fierz-Etzweiler*.
