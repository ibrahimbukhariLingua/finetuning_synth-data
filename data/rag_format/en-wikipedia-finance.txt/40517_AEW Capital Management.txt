## Disputes

NMS Properties launched a lawsuit against AEW in 2014 over a Nine building property portfolio in Santa Monica that was jointly owned by the two firms. NMS tried to buy out AEW's stake for $106 million but AEW stated NMS forged the agreement. After litigation between the two firms for several years, AEW eventually won the lawsuit then took over control of the properties and sold them for $430 million.
