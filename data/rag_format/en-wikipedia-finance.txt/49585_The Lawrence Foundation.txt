## Background

Trillium Digital Systems, Inc. developed and licensed communications software and was founded in 1988 by Jeff Lawrence and Larisa Chistyakov. The founding trustees of the foundation were Jeff and Diane. Diane died in 2016. The current trustees are Jeff and his two children.

## Direct funding

In March 2005, The Lawrence Foundation, in conjunction with the Natural Resources Defense Council and Tufts University, organized and hosted a workshop of environmental economists from academia. The purpose of the workshop was to identify, develop and engage a network of economists and others that shared and supported a common vision of developing, delivering and advocating credible and effective economic theories and arguments for environmental protection, stewardship, and investment. In 2006, the economists who attended that meeting started Center for the Applied Study of Economics and Environment (CASE&E), with a year of preliminary programs â€“ launching an online directory of economists open to working with the environmental movement, and offering summer internships with environmental groups, and dissertation support, for economics graduate students. The organization continues to grow and recently changed its name to Economics for Equity and the Environment Network (E3) to more accurately reflect its current focus.
