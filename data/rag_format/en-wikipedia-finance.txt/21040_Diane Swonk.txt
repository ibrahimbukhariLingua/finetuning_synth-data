## Career

Swonk started her career at the age of 22 when she joined First Chicago Corporation in 1985 as an associate economist. Despite encounters with workplace gender discrimination, by the turn of the century, Swonk became "widely regarded as one of the premier forecasters of the U.S. economy". The bank later merged with Banc One Corporation to become Bank One. Swonk rose to become director of Economics and senior vice president, prior to leaving the firm in 2004.

Lodged at a nearby New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel to attend an annual National Association for Business Economics (NABE) conference at the time; her economic focus shifted from pure numeracy following the events of 9/11, as she then ascertained economics to be equally influenced by social as by financial policy. Swonk joined the faculty of Kellstadt Graduate School of Business at DePaul University, as a clinical professor of finance that year.

In November 2004, Swonk was appointed chief economist and senior managing director at Mesirow Financial. She spent 11 years at the firm, before leaving in 2016 to found her private consulting firm, DS Economics, where she is CEO.

Swonk was appointed chief economist of Grant Thornton, LLP in January 2018. In July 2022, KPMG US appointed her as its chief economist.
