It was founded in 1980 by Robert T. Huang and based in Fremont, California. As an information technology supply chain services company, it offered services to original equipment manufacturers, software publishers and reseller customers.


## History

Originally founded as a technology hardware distributor, Synnex distributes products and related logistics services. As a business process outsourcing and contract assembly it works with industry suppliers of IT systems, peripherals, system components, software and networking equipment. The company is one of the major employers in Greenville, South Carolina. On 21 December 2009, Synnex acquired Jack of All Games from Take-Two Interactive. In December 2010 Synnex acquired the managed business solutions division of e4e, an ITes service provider located in Bangalore in India.

In 2012 Hyve Solutions announced a partnership with IBM and Zettaset to produce a bundled "turnkey" platform for Hadoop-based analytics targeted to the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses. Synnex acquired IBM's worldwide customer care business process outsourcing (BPO) services business on 11 September 2013.

In June 2017, Synnex acquired the North and Latin American operations of Westcon-Comstor, along with 10% of the remaining part of Westcon (Westcon International) from Datatec for a reported $800 million.

On 28 June 2018, Convergys and Synnex announced they have reached a definitive agreement in which Synnex would acquire Convergys for $2.43 billion in combined stock and cash, and integrate it with Concentrix. On 5 October 2018, the merger was completed.

On 9 January 2020, Dennis Polk, President and Chief Executive Officer of Synnex, announced plans to separate SYNNEX and Concentrix into two publicly traded companies. The spinoff was completed on 1 December 2020, with Synnex shareholders getting one share of Concentrix for each share of Synnex they held.

In July 2021, the Republican National Convention's servers were hacked through Synnex. The company said it "could potentially be in connection" with the Kaseya VSA ransomware attack that unfolded days prior.
