2018 California Proposition 70


# 2018 California Proposition 70

 

Proposition 70, also known as Prop 70, was a California ballot proposition and proposed state constitution amendment intended to make it a requirement, starting in 2024, for revenue generated from cap and trade programs to be gathered in a special fund. After the money had been collected, the state legislature would have to have a two-thirds majority vote to spend the funds. Opponents of the proposition argued that it will embolden anti-environment special interest groups since the two-thirds majority requirement would lead to more legislative gridlock. Supporters of the proposition argued that it will make sure that the money is spent on important projects and is spent properly. It failed in the June 2018 California primary elections. Supporters of the proposed amendment include Jerry Brown, who was governor at the time, the California Chamber of Commerce and the Rural County Representatives of California. Opponents of the proposed amendment include the California Democratic Party, Center for Biological Diversity, NextGen America and Fossil Free California.
