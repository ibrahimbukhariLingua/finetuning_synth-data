Broadgate Tower


# Broadgate Tower



The **Broadgate Tower** is a skyscraper in London's main financial district, the City of London. It was constructed between 2005 and 2008.


## History

The developer for the site was British Land. In February 2005 Broadgate Plaza Ltd, a subsidiary of British Land, submitted a planning application to the City of London for the construction of two buildings of 33 stories and 13 stories. Broadgate Tower, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and built by Bovis Lend Lease, was completed in 2008. It was constructed at the same time as the neighbouring building, 201 Bishopsgate, and the two are separated by a covered pedestrian area.

The building was used in the James Bond Skyfall movie to represent a Shanghai skyscraper.
