In Italian history there was attempts to delineate a network of National roads; the Law 1094 of the 17th May 1928 (Decreto del 17 maggio 1928) established the "**Azienda Autonoma Statale delle Strade" (AASS)** (Autonomous State Agency of the Roads) with the first 137 National Roads. In the years the Agency grow up and after the Ethiopic War it managed about 5000 km of roads. This Agency was merged into Ministry of public works.

The road network expanded between 2018 and 2021 as a result of the 'Rientro Strade' plan, which brought 6,500 km of former highway, regional and county road back under Anas management. The plan was launched in August 2017 with the agreement sanctioned by the Conferenza Unificata, which was followed by the Prime Ministerial Decree of 20 February 2018, while the second phase of the plan started in April 2021 in execution of the D.P.C.M. of 21 November 2019.
