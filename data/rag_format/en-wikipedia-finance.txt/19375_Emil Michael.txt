### Journalism controversy

On November 17, 2014, *BuzzFeed* editor-in-chief Ben Smith reported that Michael, then a senior executive at Uber, had "outlined the notion of spending 'a million dollars'" to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists to look into "personal lives, your families" of journalists who covered Uber and its executives. Michael, who said he believed his conversation was "off the record," later claimed merely to have asked why journalists can write what he thought were false stories and attack pieces about business people. He targeted Sarah Lacy, a journalist who worked for *Pando Daily,* who had reported on Uber's misogynist practices and culture. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick later made a series of apologetic tweets, claiming that Michael's comments did not represent the company's views. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism of Uber. Michael later apologized for his words.


### Karaoke bar controversy

In 2014, several local Uber employees in Seoul, South Korea, invited Michael to join them at a "hostess escort-karaoke bar" during a business trip. Four men in the group picked hostesses out of a lineup, and then went to the bar to sing karaoke. One of the female Uber managers in the group felt uncomfortable during this encounter and reported the event to HR at Uber about one year later. The story came out in March 2017 when Michael contacted Gabi Holzwarth, who had been in the group at the bar, to warn her about an upcoming article in the press and, Holzwarth said, to ask her to keep the visit quiet. Michael later expressed remorse and apologized for "attending and failing to prevent" the visit to the bar.

Three months after the news broke, Michael left his position at Uber after four years at the company.
