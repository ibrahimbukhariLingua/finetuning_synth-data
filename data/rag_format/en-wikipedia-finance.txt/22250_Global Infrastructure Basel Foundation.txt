Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation


# Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation



**Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation** (GIB) is an independent, not-for-profit foundation under Swiss law active in the field of sustainable urban infrastructure. The CEO of GIB is Louis Downing.


## Activities

GIB supports various stakeholders such as governments, banks, and cities, in the designing, implementing, and financing of infrastructure projects at all stages of the project cycle. Currently, the foundation particularly works on:

* The SuRe Standard â€“ The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure: a global voluntary ISEAL standard, developed in cooperation with the French bank Natixis that integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade;
* a Resilience and Sustainability Credit Rating;
* Capacity building services to enable infrastructure developers, financiers, and public sector actors to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to create green infrastructure; and
* consultancy and tailored services to municipalities and their stakeholders.

GIB also organizes the GIB Sustainable Infrastructure Summit and is regularly asked to provide input at sustainable infrastructure events.

GIB has also developed the SmartScan, an infrastructure self- assessment tool that provides a rapid assessment of an infrastructure project against sustainability and resilience criteria covering Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues.
