| A female North Korean soldier, secretly a fan of South Korean K-pop boy band BTS, narrates her life before the re-unification of both North Korea and South Korea. The story begins in 2025 when the North-South border of the Korean peninsula opens to allow North Koreans and South Koreans to commute between both countries for work, as well as the South's investments in the North and the construction of the Joint-Economic Area (JEA) for economic growth of the two Koreas. The soldier, like many North Koreans, goes to the South to find work, but ends up turning to a life of crime, robbing and killing loan sharks who extorted many Northerners and poor Southerners, and becoming a nationwide fugitive. A year later, after her partner is killed, she is recruited by a man who introduced himself as the "Professor" to help commit a four trillion won money heist. She joins him and takes on the code name "Tokyo". Tokyo is also joined by former North Korean camp prisoner "Berlin", con artist "Nairobi", ex-convict "Moscow" and his son, underground fighter "Denver", skilled hacker "Rio", and brothers "Oslo" and "Helsinki" from a Yanbian gang. Together, the group goes to the Mint at JEA, where they hold the employees and visitors hostage and begin to print bank notes worth four trillion won. South Korean crisis negotiation team leader Seon Woo-jin and North Korean captain Cha Moo-hyuk are later ordered to lead a group of police officers from both Koreas to monitor and diffuse the hostage situation. Unknown to Woo-jin however, the Professor is her current boyfriend and cafe owner Park Sun-ho. | | | | | | |

| Not knowing the Professor's identity, Woo-jin negotiates with the Professor (who is giving orders in a secret room in his cafe) to ensure the safety of the hostages; the group (except Berlin) has promised to not hurt the hostages as long as they follow orders. Among the hostages are the Mint's director Cho Young-min, Young-min's lover and employee Yoon Mi-seon, and high school student Anne Kim, who is the daughter of the US Ambassador and part of a school field trip. As several employees of the Mint are ordered by their captors to print the notes, Young-min, who is desperate to get out, asks Mi-seon to help him take his smartwatch from his office to contact the police, since the hostages' phones were confiscated. Mi-seon pretends to be pregnant in accordance to Young-min's lies and Denver takes her away to another room, where she sneaks out and retrieves the watch with Anne's help. After a few attempts to contact the outside world, the smartwatch is discovered and Berlin, despite the Professor's orders, decides to punish Young-min by having his lover Mi-seon executed. Denver takes her to the bathroom and shoots her. | | | | | | |
| 3 | 3 | "Episode 3" | Kim Hong-sun | Ryu Yong-jae, Kim Hwan-chae, Choe Sung-jun | June 24, 2022 (2022-06-24) |
| Tokyo discovers that Denver shot Mi-seon in the leg, and decides to help him hide her in an underground vault, where they apply first aid. Tokyo wants to have Berlin removed from his leadership role due to his violence and unpredictability, while Denver tends to Mi-seon. Young-min struggles with his sadness over Mi-seon's "death" while enduring the other hostages' condemnation for putting Mi-seon in danger in his place out of selfishness; the North Korean employees threaten to kill him if he tries to put the others in danger again. Later, Tokyo enlists Nairobi and Rio's help to subdue Helsinki and Oslo and they confront Berlin at the office, where the heist members get into a heated argument over Berlin's disobedience. During the argument, Moscow is shocked and distraught to hear that Denver killed Mi-seon, and without knowing the full truth, he recklessly exits the Mint to surrender in his son's place, willing to take the fall for Mi-seon's "murder". Denver manages to catch up and stop him, revealing that Mi-seon is alive. As there are snipers stationed outside the Mint aiming their guns at the two, Berlin sends the team and a few hostages to escort Moscow and Denver back inside while armed. Young-min tries to once again threaten Tokyo and the others to release him. Mistaking Young-min as the captor, Woo-jin gives the order for the snipers to shoot Young-min. | | | | | | |
| 4 | 4 | "Episode 4" | Kim Hong-sun | Ryu Yong-jae, Kim Hwan-chae, Choe Sung-jun | June 24, 2022 (2022-06-24) |
| Young-min is shot in the chest and barely survives; he is brought back inside the Mint to be given first aid, but there's little the robbers can do. The police recognise Young-min and decide to negotiate with the Professor to send medics inside the Mint to treat and save Young-min. Moo-hyuk pretends to be a nurse and enters the Mint with two nurses and a surgeon. Berlin, tipped off by the Professor, confronts Moo-hyuk. Moo-hyuk states that he's a policeman sent to ensure the medics' safety. In reality, an ambush team (wearing the same attire and mask as the heist team) is secretly infiltrating the Mint while Moo-hyuk and the medics help buy them time to enter the compound. The Professor sees through this and orders the hostages and heist team to switch to another mask to differentiate themselves from the ambush team; this leads to Woo-jin ordering the team to abort their mission and retreat. Before they do, however, Rio manages to install eavesdropping software on Moo-hyuk's phone. Denver and Tokyo steal the medics' medical supplies to allow Rio, a medical school dropout, to operate on Mi-seon. Berlin detains Tokyo and Rio, and tries to kill Mi-seon; Denver stands in front of Berlin's gun, showing his growing affection for Mi-seon. Nairobi subdues Berlin, who is later tied up as punishment for defying the Professor's orders. Mi-seon, now largely improved from her injuries, rejoins the hostages, who rejoice at the truth of her survival as Nairobi and Tokyo take charge and show more lenience to the hostages under their supervision. | | | | | | |
| 5 | 5 | "Episode 5" | Kim Hong-sun | Ryu Yong-jae, Kim Hwan-chae, Choe Sung-jun | June 24, 2022 (2022-06-24) |
| Park Chul-woo, a secret agent from the ambush team earlier on, blends in as a hostage after he fails to escape with the other agents on time. He gets into contact with Young-min, Mi-seon and Anne, devising a plan to save the hostages and subdue the captors. Woo-jin gradually realises the Professor is outside the Mint, and finds evidence that a used car sent to the junkyard was used by the Professor on the first day the hostage situation occurred. As the Professor narrowly escapes police pursuit to take away the car and destroy evidence, Chul-woo and Young-min abduct Denver to torture and interrogate him on the Professor's identity and whereabouts. Chul-woo and Anne subsequently fake a situation of a fire breaking out as a distraction, while Berlin attacks Rio to escape his bonds. Young-min, thinking that Denver and Mi-seon were in a relationship, beats up Denver, but Mi-seon, who seems to have fallen for Denver, stops him and tells Denver about Chul-woo's plan. Just as Chul-woo is about to shoot Tokyo, Denver alerts her. A gunshot is heard from the distance. Outside, Woo-jin opens up to the Professor more as the latter begins to feel guilty for his secret identity. | | | | | | |

| Hearing the gunshot, the police assume Chul-woo is dead. Woo-jin plans to use media attention to turn public opinion against the heist team. Berlin, who reveals his real name as Song Jung-ho, gathers the hostages and allows Woo-jin to enter the Mint with a cameraman to verify the hostages' safety and assure their loved ones. Woo-jin reveals to the public that the "hostage" Chul-woo is missing and assumed dead, lying that he was a recently hired security guard, something that Anne and Young-min confirm. She claims the heist team broke their promise to not hurt the hostages, and demands the students' release, which stirs outrage against the heist team. However, Berlin reveals that Chul-woo is still alive, as he had been wearing a vest when he was shot. Berlin accuses the police of using Chul-woo to endanger the hostages' safety, as well as only intending to save Anne (due to her father's political background), not the other hostages. Berlin declares this as proof that the heist team only wants money and never to harm the hostages, which further cements public anger against the police and government; Woo-jin leaves the Mint in defeat. As the heist team nears the end of their mission, Denver bids Mi-seon an early farewell; they have sex. On the outside, Moo-hyuk resigns, while a distressed Woo-jin goes on a date with the Professor, who realizes his love for Woo-jin. This date is cut short when Woo-jin finds a secret message left by Anne. As the Professor returns to his café, he comes face-to-face with Moo-hyuk, who earlier suspected him. | | | | | | |

| Moo-hyuk probes the Professor. He steals a handcraft blade to check the Professor's fingerprints. The Professor instructs Rio to hack into Moo-hyuk's phone to frame him as a mole. Kim Sangman, a politician, broadcasts a message to the robbers that he would speak to the President to grant immunity to any robber that would bring an end to the heist. An unidentified member of the heist team contacts Sangman, and Sangman provides a condition that the US ambassador's daughter, Anne Kim, must first be killed. Anne is the only factor stopping the police from using brute force to enter the Mint. Anne is lured to the vault with a promise of escape. Woo-jin discovers Sangman's plan, and informs the Professor. The heist team frantically searches for Anne, and discover a bomb in the vault. The bomb explodes, but Anne is safe. She had not entered the vault, as she did not wish to escape alone. Moo-hyuk retrieves the results on the handcraft blade, and confirms his suspicions. The police attempt to arrest him for leaking official secrets, but he resists arrest and runs away to tell Woo-jin that Sun-ho, her boyfriend, is the Professor. Rio is blocking his phone calls, so Woo-jin never receives the message. The Professor confronts Moo-hyuk and after a struggle, knocks him out with a needle. The Professor stows him in the trunk of a car, however Woo-jin's mother witnesses the event, and runs to the phone to tell her daughter. Conscious that there can be no loose ends, the Professor enters the house with the intention of killing Woo-jin's mother. Upon entering, he overhears her call with her daughter, in which she cannot remember why she has called. The Professor realises that she suffers from dementia. He leaves the house without killing her. Woo-jin, upon hearing of Moo-hyuk's supposed betrayal, visits Sun-ho. She points a gun at him and demands he show her upstairs in his café. When they enter the room, it appears to be an ordinary storage room. Woo-jin apologises, but Sun-ho tells her to leave and ends the relationship. After realizing that the robbers are printing money, Woo-jin orders the Mint's electricity to be cut off. | | | | | | |

On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

Joel Keller of *Decider* appreciated the performances of Yoo Ji-tae as the Professor, Jeon Jong-seo as Tokyo and Kim Yun-jin as Seon Woo-jin, writing, "each providing just the right tone to make the show less an over-the-top heist series and more of a layered treatise on the economic gap that everyone is suffering through at this stage in world history." Keller concluded, "If you're a fan of *Money Heist*, you'll like *Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area*." Pierce Conran of the *South China Morning Post* rated the series with 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "the purpose of *Money Heist* is to entertain rather than educate, and entertain it does with a story that hums along with all the thrills and twists required of a well-planned and inventively thwarted heist narrative."

S. Poorvaja of *The Hindu* wrote, "The first season of *Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area* gets right in terms of its setting and characters, but here's hoping the makers push the envelope and take some risks in the second season."
