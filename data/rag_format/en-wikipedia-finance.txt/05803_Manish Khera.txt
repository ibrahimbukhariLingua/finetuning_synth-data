## Career


### Years with ICICI Bank (1993–2006)

In 2004, after gaining experience in corporate and structured lending, and transaction banking and banking technology, Manish set up the Alternate Channels Group (ACG) within ICICI Bank to serve the need and opportunity of offering banking services to the banking-deprived in India. ACG's objective was to find unconventional and alternate channels to provide banking services to the unserved segment.

During this period, he also worked with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to get the Business Correspondent guidelines issued working with the Khan Committee, which gave recommendations for this pioneering change of financial inclusion initiative in India.

At the Alternate Channels Group, Manish designed a system that leveraged biometric paperless technology and no physical infrastructure to reach the unserved and underbanked population in India. That laid the foundation for Financial Information Network and Operations Ltd. (FINO), which was later renamed FINO Paytech.


### Years with FINO Paytech Limited (2005–2013)

FINO Paytech Ltd. was founded in 2006 by Manish Khera. He was Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the company.

In 2006, Manish combined low-cost innovation aligned with customer ability and skill sets, the lack of infrastructure in India and the radical move by RBI to permit Business Correspondents to solicit and service customers, to successfully deliver banking services for the micro-segment (below poverty line population) along with business profitability. This endeavour has been one of the most appreciated success stories in the micro segment category. His thought and innovative approach to the business has encouraged other players in the field to come up and create value chains for their customers of the same segment. Under his leadership, FINO grew to service over 70 million customers across more than 50,000 Business Correspondent points, making it the largest globally. FINO has now become FINO Payments Bank.


### Years with YTS – Yatra Tatra Sarvatra (2014–present)

After the success of FINO Paytech Ltd., Manish invested in Yatra Tatra Sarvatra (YTS) in 2014. The USP of YTS was its ubiquitous services. YTS operated on a mobile banking platform that assisted migrant customers in remitting money instantaneously across the country at a low cost and in carrying out their banking transactions using a low cost phone.

Manish Khera was an applicant of the Small Finance Bank under RBI guidelines along with 72 others, though his application was not successful.


## Awards and recognition

Khera has received praise for his role as one of the thought leaders in the financial inclusion and micro-finance space in India.

He has been honoured and recognized as "Young Global Leader of 2011" by World Economic Forum.

Manish has also been recognized by E&Y as the "Entrepreneur of the Year 2011" and has been awarded the Forbes India Leadership award 2012 for the "Outstanding Start-Up".
