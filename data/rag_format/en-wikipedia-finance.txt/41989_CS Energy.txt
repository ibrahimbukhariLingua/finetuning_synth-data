CS Energy also owns Callide Power Station in a 50/50 joint venture with InterGen.

CS Energy is adding the 100 MW/200 MWh Chinchilla Battery grid-scale battery to its Kogan Creek site on the Western Downs. Construction is currently underwayᵃˢ ᵒᶠ? on the battery and it is expected to be operational in late 2023.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

CS Energy was awarded A$32 million in 2010 to help construct Australia's first large-scale solar thermal project at Kogan Creek Power Station. Funding was provided by the Rudd Government under the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program. However, in March 2016, it was announced that CS Energy would 'pull the plug' on that project, at a loss of $40M to CS Energy and $6M to ARENA.

In 2020, Stanwell and CS Energy were accused of driving up prices by creating an artificial lack of supply. CS Energy and Stanwell are defending a class action filed by a law firm and backed by litigation funders related to historical electricity prices. CS Energy has publicly rejected the claims being made and is strongly defending the class action. An initial hearing is scheduled to commence in the Federal Court of Australia in June 2024.
