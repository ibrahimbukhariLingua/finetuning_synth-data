## History

In 1978, Plukon was created as a merger of the 1964 established brand *Friki* and the poultry company *Bekebrede* in Barneveld, the name being the acronym ***Plu**imvee **Ko**mbinatie **N**ederland*.

In 2011, German poultry company *Stolle* was merged into the Plukon group.

In 2015, the EW Group became shareholder of Plukon. In the following years, Plukon acquired the French poultry producer DUC, the Spanish poultry producer VMR and the German hatchery Optibrut.

## Controversies

Since 2014, there have been repeated protests against the Plukon slaughterhouse in Gudensberg, Germany. In February 2014, several hundred people demonstrated against a planned expansion of the facility, followed by another demonstration in 2015. In April 2021, the trade union Nahrung-Genuss-Gaststätten organized a demonstration in Gudensberg for better working conditions of the workers. In May 2021, environmental activists blocked the access roads of the poultry slaughterhouse in Gudensberg in an action of civil disobedience. The activists demanded a closure of the plant for reasons of animal welfare and danger of Corona infections.
