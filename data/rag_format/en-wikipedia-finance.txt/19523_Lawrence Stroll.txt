## Career

Stroll's father brought Pierre Cardin fashionwear and Ralph Lauren clothing to Canada.
Stroll later took the Ralph Lauren brand to Europe.

Along with Hong Kong investor Silas Chou, Stroll invested in clothing designers Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, and the pair largely contributed to the brands' growth to global prominence. Stroll's company, Sportswear Holdings, sold the last of its stake in these businesses in 2014. During the 2000s, Chou and Stroll also invested in Asprey & Garrard.

From 2000 until August 2022, Stroll owned the Circuit Mont-Tremblant racing circuit, in Quebec's Laurentian Mountains.

In 2014, Stroll took ownership of the Prema Racing team in the light of his son Lance racing for the outfit in Formula 4 and the FIA Formula 3 European Championship. Stroll vetoed multiple driver moves in connection with Prema; he prevented George Russell from racing for the team in the 2014 Formula Renault 2.0 Alps Series and vetoed the move of Lando Norris to the team ahead of the 2018 Formula 2 season. The team was sold to Swiss company DC Racing Solutions, managed in part by Deborah Mayer and Claudio Schiavoni, in 2021.

In August 2018, Stroll led a consortium of investors in buying the assets of the defunct Force India Formula One team. Renamed Racing Point Force India, and as a new team officially, they re-entered midway through the 2018 Formula One season and achieved 7th position in the Constructors' Championship. For the 2019 season, the team name and entrant was changed once again to Racing Point F1 Team, with Stroll's son Lance driving one of the cars, finishing in 7th position in the Constructors' Championship once again.

On 31 January 2020, it was announced that Stroll led the Yew Tree Investments consortium to invest £182 million into Aston Martin, in return for a 16.7% stake in the company. Racing Point F1 Team was re-branded as the Aston Martin F1 Team in 2021.
