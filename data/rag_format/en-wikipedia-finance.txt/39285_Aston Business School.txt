# Aston Business School



**Aston Business School (ABS),** is an international business school part of **Aston University** in Birmingham, England.


## History

The Department of Industrial Administration at the Birmingham Central Technical College (now Aston University) enrolled its first students in 1947, with a remit to "consolidate and extend teaching work in industrial administration". David Hall Bramley was the first Head of the Department, and is recognised for his pioneering work in Industrial Management Education at the university.

Research at Aston Business School has its roots back to 1961 when the Industrial Administration Research Unit (IARU) was set up and within it the ‘Aston Studies’ on organisations. The research was ground breaking with the study of groups of workers and individuals being carried out in their workplace and organisation setting.

Aston received its charter in 1966, and in October 1972 the Management Centre was set up, merging the Department of Industrial Administration and the Graduate Centre for Management Studies and offering undergraduate, postgraduate, research and post-experience courses. 1978 saw the opening of the Nelson Building, purpose-built for the Management Centre. Its first MBAs were awarded in 1979. The Centre became the Aston Business School in 1988.

The MSc in International Business offered for the first time in 1997, and the BSc in International Business and Management in 2005.

In 1999, the Aston Business School Advisory Board was formed. The Board advises the School's senior leadership team on strategic areas in relation to learning and teaching, research, and business engagement. Several board members support specific initiatives within the School, with many board members acting as mentors to final year undergraduate students.

Aston Business School gained the first of its triple accreditation awards EQUIS, in 1999, followed by AACSB in 2003 and AMBA in 2006. It has maintained triple accreditation ever since.

In 2006, a £20m extension to the Nelson Building opened. Now called the Aston Business School building, it includes a dedicated MBA suite as well as conference centre and hotel.


## Programmes

Aston Business School offers a range of undergraduate (BSc) degrees including single honours programmes covering the main business and management disciplines, and a choice of joint honours programmes. A distinctive feature of Aston's first degrees is the industrial placement year which provides students with professional workplace experience.

At postgraduate level, the Aston MBA is offered through full-time, part-time and online learning, together with a wide range of taught MSc courses. These also include business and industry placements.

Aston was one of the first UK universities to offer degree apprenticeships, a new route to higher education based on a collaboration with employers, apprentices and universities. Aston Business School delivers the Chartered Manager Degree Apprenticeship amongst many others.

In 2017, Aston Business School began offering a suite of postgraduate business and management courses fully online as part of a new Aston University Online initiative.
