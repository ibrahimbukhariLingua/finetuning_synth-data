Real estate in Kenya


# Real estate in Kenya



The **real estate sector in Kenya** has seen a boom that began somewhere in the mid to late 2000s because the property market is responding to increased demand.

In Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya, there is one of the largest expatriate communities in the continent due to the significant number of multinationals who have chosen Nairobi as either their African hub or East and Central African hub. The rebirth of property development in Nairobi has attracted global attention. In its 2012 Wealth Report, real estate management company, Knight Frank, ranked Nairobi as the fastest-growing real estate market in the world, outpacing cities like Miami and Monaco. Real estate prices in Nairobi rose 25 per cent between January and December 2011. Nairobi was also voted as one of the top 10 cities to watch by global real estate firm, Jones Lang LaSalle, out of 150 cities globally.


## Kenyan cities

In 2012, Nairobi and Mombasa were the only cities in the "southern hemisphere" to have reported double digit property price increases, out of 71 cities surveyed in the Prime International Residential Index. The table shows property price growth in the top cities in the survey.

The report noted that inflows from Kenyans in the diaspora are particularly significant in driving the prices and that the cost per square metre of land in Nairobi and Mombasa is still lower than other cities such as Monaco.


## Markets


### Office

The office market in Kenya has moved from a position of oversupply and the market is finally stabilising, as Nairobi reinforces its position as the regional commercial hub of Sub-Saharan Africa.


### Retail

Kenya continues to experience some of the most decentralised growth of the retail market as marketers move outside Nairobi and go to other urban centres in Kenya such as Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Nakuru.


### Industrial

Most industrial companies in Kenya tend to avoid renting or leasing space. However, over the recent years there has been significant development especially along Mombasa Rd. Rent and take up is low so the sector might need a couple more years to mature.


### Residential

The residential market has actually been one of the key drivers of the property market. There has been a significant number of development projects coming up both within the Greater Nairobi Area and other urban areas such as Mombasa, Naivasha and Kisumu.

It is comparable to the mostly-expat-inhabited neighbourhood of Itaewon in South Korea. However, it is much smaller.


#### Runda, Muthaiga, Lavington, Karen

These areas are Kenya's most expensive neighbourhoods; however, it is very likely that the neighbourhoods like Runda will lose its tag due to the recent demolitions and others are seeing more and more townhouses rather than mansions and villas.


### Machakos (East Metro)

### Kiambu (North Metro)

## Mombasa

Mombasa is the second-largest city in Kenya. Prime land in Mombasa is up for grabs as a property boom like the one witnessed in the 1970s continues to push up home prices in the coastal town.


### Shanzu

Shanzu is also another affluent neighbourhood right past Whitesands beach hotel at Bamburi beach. The area houses high-profile housing developments.

As of March 2013ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the project was 30% complete. A complete virtual tour of the property has been created to give online users a feel of what to expect from the development.
