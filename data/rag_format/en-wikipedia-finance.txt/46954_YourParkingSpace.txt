## History


### Early beginnings

YourParkingSpace was founded by Charles Cridland in London in 2006 as a free platform connecting driveway owners with motorists searching for affordable parking. Joined by co-founder Harrison Woods in November 2013, the business was relaunched, and a limited company formed. Woods had recently sold Primal Parking, a similar online service which secured a £60,000 investment from Theo Paphitis and Peter Jones on a 2012 episode of Dragons’ Den.
