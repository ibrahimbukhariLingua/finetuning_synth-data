Two further tenders were awarded to consortia including Brisa in 2009. The firm leads the Auto-estradas do Baixo Tejo concession with a 30% stake, which includes construction, widening, operation and maintenance of motorways and *Itinerários Complementares* trunk roads in the Setúbal area. Brisa also holds 15% of the Litoral Oeste concession, which covers 112 km of new and existing road around Leiria. Both contracts were awarded through to 2038.

Other major investments held by the company within Portugal include 60% of the Via Verde electronic toll collection system, also used in car parks and for other purposes; 100% of roadside assistance firm Brisa Assistência Rodoviária; and 60% of Controlauto, a chain of outlets offering vehicle inspection services.

The company has signalled its intent to diversify into other modes of transportation. In December 2009 a Brisa-led consortium was awarded a contract to construct the first stage of a high-speed rail link between Lisbon and Madrid by the Portuguese government, giving it a 40-year concession to operate the line within Portugal. Brisa, along with Mota-Engil, also heads the Asterion consortium which intends to bid for control of the Portuguese airport authority ANA should it be privatised by the government; and with it the right to construct and operate the proposed replacement for Lisbon's international airport in Alcochete.

In 2007 the firm purchased 30% of Movenience, the electronic toll collection system used in the Western Scheldt Tunnel in the Dutch province of Zeeland; this stake was increased to 40% in 2010.

Brisa's 16.3% holding in Brazilian peer Companhia de Concessões Rodoviárias (CCR) was sold in June 2010.
