## Carnival Cinemas

Shrikant Bhasi began working in the entertainment industry after he launched a project to test the market of film trade financing in India during which he realized that there was a dearth of screens in India. This led to the opening of Carnival Cinemas' first theatre in Angamaly which was built on the top floor of a bus terminal complex. The venture was a success, prompting the company to expand to Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and eventually to the rest of India.

In 2014 Carnival Cinemas acquired HDIL's Broadway Cinema chain, which had screens across Mumbai, Delhi and Indore. They also acquired Anil Ambani's Big Cinemas, which made them one of the top three exhibition companies in India. The following year the company purchased the commercial real estate projects Larsen and Toubro Ltd for Rs. 1,785 crore. Bhasi and Carnival's next major step was the acquisition of Anil Ambani owned Big Cinemas with 250 screens across the country for around Rs 700 crore. During this time Bhasi also took over Mukesh Ambani's Network 18 Media and Investments Ltd owned Glitz Cinemas. Subsequently, all the Big Cinemas multiplex screens were re-branded as Carnival Cinemas by 2016.As a result of the merger,Carnival had operations in 20 states: Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Haryana, Delhi NCR, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Goa with 470 screens in 120 locations. There were plans to double the screen count to 1000 screens by 2023.
Shrikant Bhasi had further stated that he follows both organic and inorganic growth plans and the company has laid out a large scale growth plan in Madhya Pradesh. The company has named the project "Project Jalsa" and they have expressed the belief that this will contribute to the overall development of the state while also providing other benefits to the government and community.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ If successful, Bhasi would expand the project to another 50 towns in the state and to other states like Bihar, Jharkhand, and Orissa.
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,Carnival Cinemas was unable to continue operations in a sustainable manner and ended in debt.This led to closure of operations in many cities and filing of several petitions against the cinema chain for insolvency.
