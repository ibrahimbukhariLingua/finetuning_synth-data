# Yettel Bulgaria



**Yettel Bulgaria** (formerly known as *Telenor Bulgaria*) is the largest mobile network and the third largest fixed telecommunications company in Bulgaria. The company was founded under the name "Cosmo Bulgaria Mobile" in 2001 by OTE and operated under the brand name "Globul" until 2014. In 2013 it was bought by Telenor and changed its name. In August 2018, the company was acquired by PPF, a Czech private investment fund. The company continued to use the Telenor brand until 1 March 2022, when it was renamed to Yettel Bulgaria. In February 2024, the company was acquired by e& (Etisalat), and the merger was approved by Bulgaria's competition watchdog. However the branding of Yettel has not yet been changed.


## History

The company was founded in 2001 by telecommunications corporation OTE group, from 2005 to 2013 it was part of the Cosmote brand line of the group, since August 2013, is 100% owned by Norwegian telecommunications corporation Telenor which acquired it from OTE in for EUR 717 million.

Globul changed its company logo in June 2006 to unify it with the Cosmote brand.

Second rebranding started on 16 October 2014 after Telenor's acquisition. Globul has been using Telenor's name since November 2014.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In January 2018, the company's management confirmed media reports that there is interest in sale of Telenor's business in Southeast Europe, including Telenor Bulgaria. In March 2018, Telenor sold its business in Central and East Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Montenegro and Serbia) to the investment fund PPF, for a sum of 2.8 billion euros.

As of 1 March 2022 the company Telenor Bulgaria has been named Yettel Bulgaria. The name change was a part of the wider rebranding initiative in Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia where the PPF’s Telenor branded businesses operate.

In 2023, it was reported that PPF was considering selling its stake in Yettel to UAE-based Telecommunications group e& (Etisalat). In 2024, Bulgaria’s competition watchdog approved the sale of Yettel Bulgaria alongside infrastructure provider Cetin Bulgaria to e& (Etisalat).


## Network

As of 2012, Globul's GSM network covers 99,98% of Bulgaria's population and 99,48% of the country's territory. The company has roaming agreements with over 400 operators in more than 170 countries and territories worldwide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2005, Globul received a license for developing and implementing 3G UMTS mobile telecommunications network as well as a fixed telephony license. 3G services were launched in September 2006 and have since been upgraded to support HSPA+ with speeds of up to 42 Mbit/s download and 5.76 Mbit/s upload. As of December 2012, Globul's UMTS network covers 94,81% of the country's population.

Telenor uses the access code 089. Until 2003, it used the codes 099 and 098, the latter having been added as the network had expanded. In mid-2003, however, mobile numbers in Bulgaria increased by one digit (by adding an initial *-8-*) and the network code changed to 089 only.

Alongside Globul, OTE had also owned one of the two public telephone networks in the country – *BulFon*, which it sold back to the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company in 2005.

After Telenor acquired Globul was made the intent that the whole existing network (both 2G and 3G) shall be rebuilt. Later in a press release it was revealed that Huawei had been selected. In early 2013 the process has already begun. Telenor created a specific webpage that shows in which region and when the network would be rebuilt. The deadline is by mid 2015. Telenor also said that the network that they build would be easily made 4G LTE when the market indicates that it is ready for it.
