## History and powers

The CBK joined the Association of African Central Banks on December 23, 1968.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the CBK instituted a loan restructuring program to help financially distressed borrowers. The restructuring program was in place from March 2020 to March 2021.

In 2021, legislation passed the National Assembly that allows the CBK to cap interest rates and to revoke the licenses of digital lenders that breach the Data Protection Act or the Consumer Protection Act.

In October 2023, while responding to questions from a parliamentary committee on finance and national planning, CBK Governor Dr. Thugge said the decline in international reserves was caused by an overvaluation of the shilling against the dollar. This was against the backdrop of a gradual reduction in import cover from 5.5 months to 3.7 months. Thugge cited data from the IMF & World Bank which put the overvaluation of the shilling in the range of 20-25%. According to the Governor, the attempt to artificially maintain a strong exchange rate came at the cost of losing vital international reserves.
