## Assets

QIC has investments in both Australia and the United States. Most of its shopping mall investments are through a 49% shareholding in a joint venture with Forest City Enterprises. In 2017, QIC reached an agreement to buy Forest City's interest in six of FC's eleven mall investments and an option to buy four others, excluding Charleston Town Center Mall in Charleston, WV.
