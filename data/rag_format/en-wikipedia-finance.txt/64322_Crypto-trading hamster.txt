# Crypto-trading hamster



The **crypto-trading hamster**, also known as Mr Goxx, was a hamster and economic experiment that was used to randomly select cryptocurrencies to buy or sell, on a trading platform. The hamster would spin a wheel that would select from a range of cryptocurrencies, and then, using the same method, would select what action to do with them. The hamster died on the 26th of November 2021.


## Origin

The hamster was owned by a German student, who together with his friend coded the system and linked it to a real cryptocurrency portfolio on an online trading platform. The pair also created a Twitter and Twitch account for the hamster where the latest news and decisions were shared.
