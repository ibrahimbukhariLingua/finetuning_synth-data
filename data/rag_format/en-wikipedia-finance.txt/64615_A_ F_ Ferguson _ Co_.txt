A. F. Ferguson & Co.


# A. F. Ferguson & Co.



**A.F. Ferguson & Co.** was a British Indian accounting firm founded in 1893. Today it is based in Pakistan.


## History

The origins of the firm go back to 1893. Alexander Fletcher Ferguson (A. F. Ferguson), a chartered accountant from Scotland, came to Bombay in 1889 as chief accountant for the merchant firm Ritchie Stewart & Co., (later Forbes Forbes Campbell & Co. (Private) Limited). In 1893, he began his practice and was the first British chartered accountant to do so in this part of the world. P. G. Irvine, previously an assistant, became a partner in 1898 and the name of the firm was changed to Ferguson & Irvine. In 1902, owing to the ill-health of Irvine, the partnership was dissolved and the firm became A. F. Ferguson & Co., with A. F. Ferguson and W. Turner Green as partners. The firm prospered in Bombay and the Karachi office was opened on 20 March 1908. The Lahore office opened in 1926.

After the partition of India, the Pakistani practice was split off from the firm in 1952. The Pakistani section took over the Karachi and Lahore branches. The Indian branch continued to practice in India under the same name.

In 2012, Omar Zakhilwal, then-finance minister of Afghanistan, accused A.F. Ferguson & Co. of massive fraud involving approximately $900 million.
