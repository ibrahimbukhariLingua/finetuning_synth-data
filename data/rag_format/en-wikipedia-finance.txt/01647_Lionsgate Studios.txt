Lionsgate Studios


# Lionsgate Studios



**Lionsgate Studios Corp.**, simply known as **Lionsgate Studios** or **Lionsgate**, is a Canadian-American film and television production and distribution conglomerate majority-owned by Starz Entertainment, domiciled in Vancouver, British Columbia and primarily based in Santa Monica, California. It was formed on May 14, 2024, after Lionsgate spun off its film and television businesses.

Lionsgate Studios' portfolio includes Lionsgate Canada (formerly known as Entertainment One), 3 Arts Entertainment, Pilgrim Media Group, and a stake of joint venture Amblin Partners. Through the namesake Lionsgate Films studio, the company's filming division also releases films under the Summit Entertainment and eOne Films labels.


## Background

Following the completion of acquisition of Entertainment One from Hasbro on December 27, 2023, Lionsgate revealed its intention to split its film and television assets into its own company, whose Studios division would merge with a special-purpose acquisition company named Screaming Eagle Corporation to form a separate publicly traded company called **Lionsgate Studios Corporation**. The deal was closed on May 7, 2024, with the transaction setting a $4.6-billion value on Lionsgate Studios.

The company launched a week later on May 14, and began trading on Nasdaq via the stock symbol LION. Lionsgate remains its controlling shareholder, owning around 87% of it following the split. In January 2025, the studio announced its full separation for Starz.


## Films

Lionsgate Studios operates through its filming division, Lionsgate Films; which consists of its own in-house productions, as well as films under the Summit Entertainment label, and from its Lionsgate Canada subsidiary. The latter company, which was known as Entertainment One prior to its sale to Lionsgate, also houses the libraries of defunct production companies such as Koch Entertainment, Christal Films, Alliance Atlantis (from the merger of its former existence as Alliance Communications and Atlantis Communications), Salter Street Films, Cineplex Odeon Films and Phase 4 Films.

Lionsgate Studios' library features titles from several defunct studios, including: Trimark Pictures (acquired in 2000), Artisan Entertainment (acquired in 2003 and with it Vestron Pictures which Artisan acquired in 1991), Starz Distribution (acquired by Lionsgate in 2016, which includes the libraries of Anchor Bay Entertainment, Overture Films, the pre-2015 Film Roman library and in-house content by Starz and it's predecessor IDT Entertainment), the library of Hearst's entertainment division, Tribune Entertainment (through Debmar-Mercury), American Zoetrope (distribution deal in 2010, with certain exceptions), Modern Entertainment (library acquired in 2005), the assets of The Weinstein Company and Dimension Films (post-2005 titles only; through its 18.9% stake in Spyglass Media Group).

Lionsgate Studios' complete ownership depends on various and/or specific global licensing.


## Home Entertainment

Lionsgate's movies have been released on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray, as well as on the PSP through Universal Media Disc.

Their releases are currently distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, who has released the company's content on home video since 2021, following the expiration of their deal with 20th Century Home Entertainment.


### Early history

Audiovisual releases from or by Lions Gate were previously distributed by Universal Studios Home Video (now Universal Pictures Home Entertainment) and Columbia TriStar Home Video (now Sony Pictures Home Entertainment). Lions Gate Films would eventually create two home video labels: Avalanche Home Entertainment, which released smaller Canadian B-movies on video and DVD; and Sterling Home Entertainment (a joint venture with Scanbox International, a Danish film company), which released American low-budget movies on video and DVD in the late 1990s. In June 2000, Lions Gate bought Trimark Pictures and merged its in-house home video unit with those of Avalanche and Sterling to form **Lions Gate Home Entertainment** the following year, i.e. in 2001.

After the acquisition, Sterling Home Entertainment was then renamed Studio Home Entertainment, which later folded into Lionsgate. Lions Gate bought Artisan Entertainment in 2003 and folded it into its Family Entertainment section of its Home Entertainment division the following year.

With a library of more than 8,000 films and although founded to distribute in-house productions, LGHE also previously distributed productions featuring Barbie from Mattel and *Clifford the Big Red Dog* from Scholastic Corporation, *Stickin' Around* videos from Nelvana and MGA Entertainment productions. Lionsgate Home Entertainment also previously distributed videos from the home entertainment division of the Jim Henson Company until 2012 when Henson signed a deal with Gaiam Vivendi Entertainment. With the acquisition of Artisan, LGHE also released the back catalog of ITC Entertainment until 2013, when ITC's successor-in-interest ITV Studios Global Entertainment signed a deal with Shout! Factory (now Shout! Studios).

In 2001, in Quebec it was renamed Crystal Films, and in Ontario and other provinces, Maple Pictures.


### Further deals

In August 2001, Lions Gate Home Entertainment signed a deal with DIC Entertainment to distribute their back catalogue of animated titles on video and DVD in the United States, replacing DIC's long time partner Buena Vista Home Entertainment. The partnership only lasted a year, as in 2003 DIC started to distribute their shows through the Sterling Entertainment Group (unrelated to the ex-Lionsgate subsidiary Sterling Home Entertainment) and later other distribution companies like Shout! Factory (now Shout! Studios), 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment (now 20th Century Home Entertainment) and NCircle Entertainment.

In 2008, Lionsgate Home Entertainment contracted with HIT Entertainment for DVD distribution in the US after its contract with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment expired, which ended in 2014 and got transferred to Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

On August 4, 2008, Lionsgate announced a deal with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment to acquire the distribution rights to several Touchstone Television/ABC Studios (now ABC Signature) shows including *According to Jim*, *Reaper*, *Hope & Faith*, *8 Simple Rules* and *Boy Meets World*.

In 2009, American Greetings struck a deal with Lionsgate to release its audiovisual content on DVD after its deal with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment ended, with the exception of *Strawberry Shortcake*, as it was a prior deal made in 2003 between 20th Century Fox and American Greetings.

Until 2012, Lionsgate also distributed most of the theatrical properties held by Republic Pictures on DVD under license from Paramount Pictures. The deal also expanded to include some non-marquee films originally released by Paramount themselves. Recently, with the folding of Republic, Lionsgate's function was transferred to Olive Films (and later Kino Lorber).

On February 11, 2011, Lionsgate and StudioCanal made an agreement to release 550 films from Miramax globally, replacing long time partner Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment at the time when Miramax was owned by the Walt Disney Company. It was transferred to Paramount Home Entertainment in April 2020 after the acquisition of a 49% stake in Miramax by PHE's parent company Paramount Global (at the time known as *ViacomCBS*).

With Lionsgate acquiring Summit Entertainment in 2012, its home entertainment division took over its home video releasing rights.

On December 8, 2016, Lionsgate acquired Starz Inc., which includes the North American branches of Manga Entertainment and the first incarnation of Anchor Bay Entertainment. Shortly after acquisition, Anchor Bay was folded into Lionsgate Home Entertainment and Manga is planned to be relaunched in the near future. Anchor Bay Entertainment would be revived by co-founders of Umbrelic Entertainment, Thomas Zambeck and Brian Katz, on February 15, 2024, as a production company for "genre films, undiscovered treasures, cult classics and remastered catalog releases".

On June 30, 2021, Lionsgate's North American distribution deal with 20th Century Home Entertainment expired and was taken over Sony Pictures Home Entertainment as of July 1, 2021.

After Lionsgate completed its acquisition of Entertainment One (eOne), now Lionsgate Canada, on December 27, 2023, its home entertainment division started distributing its physical releases worldwide.

On June 24, 2024, it was reported that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment had entered into a distribution deal with Studio Distribution Services to handle the physical distribution of titles from Sony Pictures (Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Crunchyroll, LLC, etc.) as well as Lionsgate, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm Ltd., 20th Century Studios, etc.) and The Criterion Collection through their existing distribution deals with SPHE.

Lionsgate later acquired TV syndication firm Debmar-Mercury on July 12, 2006 with CBS Media Ventures, at the time known as *CBS Television Distribution*, handling ad-sales, with the exception of *Meet the Browns*, which was rather co-distributed by Turner Television/Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution and Disneyâ€“ABC Domestic Television rather handling its ad-sales).

In March 2013, Lionsgate signed with Mars One, a Dutch nonprofit with space agency and aerospace backers intent on colonizing Mars, to produce a reality TV show.

On August 6, 2018, Lionsgate signed a first-look television development agreement with Universal Music Group.

With the acquisition of Entertainment One on December 27, 2023, Lionsgate restructured eOne's television assets and folded them into Lionsgate Television, creating in the process **Lionsgate Alternative Television** on January 14, 2024, which produces and distributes Lionsgate's unscripted television shows.
