Prenetics


# Prenetics



**Prenetics** (NASDAQ:PRE) is a health sciences company headquartered in Hong Kong with a significant presence in the United States. It is best known for its innovations in consumer and clinical health, focusing on early detection, prevention, and treatment of diseases, particularly cancer.

Prenetics' consumer initiatives are spearheaded by IM8, a health and wellness brand. Another key offering is CircleDNA, which utilizes next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to provide comprehensive DNA testing for consumers, offering insights into health, wellness, and genetic predispositions.

The company's clinical arm includes Insighta, a joint venture focused on developing multi-cancer early detection technologies. Additionally, ACT Genomics develops and provides a variety of genomic profiling panels, including ACTOnco, ACT HRD, ACTFusion, and ACTDrug tests, tailored to meet specific clinical needs. ACTLiquid Pro, a sequencing-based liquid biopsy assay, and ACTMonitor, which tracks drug resistance, treatment response, and cancer recurrence in real-time, are among its notable products. ACT Risk offers management solutions for assessing and mitigating cancer risks.

One of its major investors was Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Since listing, it has not been able to turn a profit. In October 2023 it announced a 1 for 15 reverse stock split so it could regain the stock exchange's required US$1 per share stock price.

Danny Yeung is CEO of Prenetics.

Prenetics has become the first Hong Kongâ€“based unicorn to list on Nasdaq following a merger with a Special-purpose acquisition company Artisan Acquisition Corp.


## Products

Its subsidiary CircleDNA focuses on disease prevention rather than genealogy. For example, in 2016 it launched a rapid DNA-based colon cancer screening product.
In 2019 it launched a line of at-home tests to be sold through retailers in Asia.


### Insighta

In 2023 it announced $200 million joint venture with the Chinese University of Hong Kong and molecular biologist Dennis Lo to launch DNA testing for several major diseases and cancers. Lo and Prenetics are working together to create a new company, Insighta, that will focus on their cancer detection work. The early detection cancer test, Presight, will begin clinical trials in 2024. The company claims that by 2027 patients will be able to test for more than 10 types of cancer with a single blood test. Danny Yeung will be CEO of Insighta and Lo will be chairman.


## Covid testing contracts

Prenetics was aggressive in marketing Covid testing capacity. It was one of three companies, and the only one from Hong Kong, selected to provide COVID-19 testing support to the Hong Kong government. It also had plans to participate in a Covid passporting scheme.

Its UK arm provided COVID-19 testing to the Premier League to help them restart football amid the pandemic. As part of so-called "project restart" the company hired former FIFA player Rio Ferdinand to reassure players about the safety of the plan. Around the same time, the company also launched pop-up testing sites for a flexible workspace provider.
