## Overview

## Transmission in Alberta

Alberta's electricity market is separated into generation, transmission, and distribution. While the cost of electricity generation is dependent upon market forces, the cost of electricity transmission and distribution in Alberta is regulated by the provincial government.

The planning and operation of Alberta's electric system is done by the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), a non-profit entity independent of any industry affiliations and owns no transmission or market assets. The AESO determines the need for the province, and then directs Transmission Facilities Owners (TFOs) to build the project.
Transmission Facilities Owners (TFOs) are regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) and include companies like AltaLink, ATCO Electric, ENMAX POWER in Calgary, and EPCOR in Edmonton. All TFOs must follow AUC regulations in engaging stakeholders, and the projects have to be approved by the AUC.


## Current projects

AltaLink is continuously working on reinforcing the transmission system on behalf of Albertans. Visit www.altalink.ca/projects for a list of all active projects.

AltaLink is governed by a board of directors. The current directors of the board include David Tuer (Chair), David R. Collyer, Calvin D. Haack, Natalie Hocken, Gary Hart, Susan Riddell Rose, Scott Thon, Steve MacDonald, Brad Wall, and Patricia Nelson.
