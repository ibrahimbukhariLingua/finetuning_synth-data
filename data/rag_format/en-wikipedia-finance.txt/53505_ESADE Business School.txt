It is part of ESADE (Catalan: *Escola Superior d'Administració i Direcció d'Empreses*, Spanish: *Escuela Superior de Administración y Dirección de Empresas*) and is associated with Ramon Llull University. ESADE has been awarded the triple accreditation by EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA, and is ranked among the world's top business schools and law school programs by the Financial Times, The Economist, Forbes, QS World University Rankings and more.


## History

The ESADE project was conceived in the spring of 1954 by a group of Spanish professionals and entrepreneurs during the period of isolation or autarchy initiated by the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Linked from the beginning to the Society of Jesus, they saw the need to professionalize the training of businessmen.

The school signed an agreement with the Jesuits (Societas Iesu) in October 1958 and started offering its first academic programs in a small building in the district of Sant Gervasi, Barcelona. In 1958, ESADE was ultimately founded. Two years later, in 1960, executive education programmes were introduced as the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. In 1964 the college's MBA programme was established. A year later, in 1965, ESADE's Barcelona campus (Av. Pedralbes) opened (Building I). In 2001, the school inaugurated its campus in Madrid (Chamartín), and two years later its campus in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Both are primarily used for Executive Education. In 2009 ESADE opened a new campus in Sant Cugat (Barcelona) as well as ESADE Creapolis, a technology park based on open innovation and situated on the new Sant Cugat campus. In 2014, it ranked fourth in the international business school ranking compiled by the Financial Times.
