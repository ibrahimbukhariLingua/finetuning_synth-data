Economic Council of Canada


# Economic Council of Canada



The **Economic Council of Canada** was an independent economic advisory body established as a federal Crown Corporation by the Government of Canada in 1963. Its purpose was to report on a wide range of pressing matters relating to Canada's economic development, focusing on five main economic objectives: full employment, sustained economic growth, price stability, equitable distribution of rising incomes, and a viable balance of payments. The council was dissolved alongside six other government organizations in 1993.


## Governance, staff and budget

The council was overseen by a chair (actually, "Chairman"), two deputy chairs and directors (with one deputy position being Director only until 1987), and not more than 25 part-time board members. The chairs and deputies were appointed by the prime minister and the board members by the governor in council. The chair was the chief executive officer and had responsibility for supervision over and direction of the work of the staff. All signed the reviews and research reports, with dissent being rare. The council reported to a minister of Parliament "as may be designated by the Governor in Council to act as the Minister responsible for purpose of the Act." Initially, this minister was Maurice Lamontagne, secretary of state, who had strongly supported the establishment of the council; by the mid-1960s it was the prime minister of Canada whom the council reported to. All the council's funding came from the federal government, via the finance and industry ministers. There were six chairs (plus one interim), as follows:

* John J. Deutsch (1963–1967)
* Arthur J.R. Smith (1968–1971)
* André Raynauld (1972–1976)
* George Post, Interim (1978)
* Sylvia Ostry (1978–1979)
* David W. Slater (1980–1985)
* Judith Maxwell (1985–1992)

The Chairs were appointed by the prime minister for seven years, but most served for four years, and four of them served as a deputy chair for several years before being appointed as Chairs. Four of them were experienced public servants: Deutsch, Post, Ostry, and Slater. Deutsch stepped down when he was appointed Principal of Queen's University. Smith went on to lead the Conference Board of Canada and several corporate boards. Raynauld was a University of Montreal professor, who left the council to serve a term in the Quebec National Assembly, and then went back to the university. Before the council, Ostry had been head of Statistics Canada and after leaving she took up a number of senior positions at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the then Department of International Trade, and some universities. Slater had been a senior Department of Finance official before being appointed to the council. After the Council closed in 1992, Maxwell founded another think tank, the Canadian Policy Research Networks

Council Board members were appointed to represent their province and their sector of society – business, labour, agriculture and consumers. The first members were appointed in December, 1963 and the first meeting of the council, along with the Chairs and Vice-chairs, was conducted in January 1964. They were expected to participate in a consensus process to set priorities for the council's research and analysis and were collectively responsible for the conclusions and recommendations contained in its major reports and statements. Members were also able to write a dissent to be included in the final report.

For the fiscal year 1965–66, the number of council staff was reported as being "about 100 including some 40 professionals drawn from federal and provincial department and agencies, business firms, labour organizations, universities and internal institutions" For that year, expenditures were about $1,254,000 (all current dollars), compared to about $947,000 in 1964–65, its first full year of operation. By 1973, staff numbered 128, comprising 72 researchers and other professional staff and 56 support staff, with another 71 persons being engaged in 62 external contracts. Expenditures were just over $3 million in 1972–73. In 1983, there were 60 economists.


## Roles and origins

The council served three main roles, as follows:

* research/analytical: its staff of economists and specialists assessed medium/long-term economic prospects compared to potential, and gathered data for conducting in-depth economic analyses and studies of various economic issues and trends;
* consultative: it encouraged maximum consultation among, and sought the advice of, labour and management, agencies of federal and provincial governments, and the Canadian public and academia, often by convening major conferences and colloquia; and
* advisory/planning/educational: Council leaders and staff produced reports and papers and then held press releases, gave speeches, and sponsored and attended conferences about its research and policy recommendations, in order to increase the level of understanding and debate on economic issues and forward-looking potential solutions among the public (federal and provincial) and private policy-makers, as well as the press and the public at large.

These functions corresponded to research needs perceived in the early post-World War II period that the council was designed and established to address. The first concerned economic research and policy-making capacity. In 1963, just prior to its establishment, a Royal Commission had found that little economic research was being carried out by the federal government and there were few non-governmental, non-academic research bodies doing the same. The commission also identified a lack of economic data, weak understanding of the principles of economic analysis, and meagre economic reporting in the press, which gaps the council would be able to fill. Indeed, the council's *Annual Reviews* were immediately seen as contributing to public information, as Canada had not, until the council's inception, a body of informed economic policy critics that would attract attention from the government. Also, there was apparent need to address a wider range of economic issues than just poor productivity growth, which was the focus of the council's predecessor organization, the National Productivity Council, which was disbanded with the creation of the council.

Moreover, there had been a perception of insufficient research focus on longer-term economic and social problems leading to *ad hoc* policy and program treatments. Thus, the Economic Council was mandated to provide medium/long-term outlooks on a range of economic and social issues. This more or less institutionalized the work of periodic Royal Commissions, such as the 1957 *Royal Commission of Economic Prospects* (Walter Gordon), which typically had a longer-term focus in terms of research and policy-making. Short-term policy-making was left to the Department of Finance and other federal departments, as it had been. However, when the Council realized the difficulty in separating short- from long-term policy objectives and adopted shorter term horizons using three-year performance indicators in 1972, tension between it and Finance arose and remained.

The second major need the council addressed was that, in the 1950s and early 1960s, there was growing interest in consultation and consensus-building. The Progressive Conservative Party (in power from 1957 to 1963) and the Liberal Party (before it was elected in 1963) had developed ideas for broader business and labour participation in economic decision-making. Moreover, many began to recognize that economic growth was falling behind that of the European countries which relied more systematically on tripartism. Thus, consultation with business and labour was to be an important aspect of the council's work. It was this lack of ideological positions and its consultative nature, along with its independence, that stood the council apart from other economic research organizations of the time and lent greater weight to its research and policy conclusions and prescriptions.

However, the consultative model adopted for the council in developing policy prescriptions – involving business and labour (and academia) – could not be said to be tripartism as understood in Europe and originally envisioned for the council, in that government did not participate in the process. Moreover, this model led to competition and rivalry between the council and government policy centres concerned with finance, employment, immigration and industry, each of which had its own policy/programming priorities and did not feel obligated to take account of the council's findings and recommendations. This became another source of tension between the council and central departments that lingered throughout its life.


## Changing context and closure

The council faced two major changes in its environment over the years. The first major change, occurring in the mid-1970s during a period of rapid inflation, was a weakening of board consensus, one of the distinguishing features of the Council model. In response to rising inflation, the federal government, in 1974, prepared to introduce wage and price controls which the labour movement adamantly opposed. After much discussion, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) members resigned from the council as they did from all forms of government cooperation. While a few labour spokespersons unaffiliated with the CLC continued to participate as council members, the loss of CLC participation signaled the end of official labour representation at the council. However, this must be viewed as part of a larger labour withdrawal from government—not specifically aimed at the council, as it remained highly critical of the government's anti-inflationary policies. Nevertheless, this lack of strong labour representation may have negatively impacted the council's credibility as a fully consultative body (though much research was carried out in the following years, as the final section shows).

The second major change in the context was growing competition for the council. When the council was launched in 1963, only two national non-profit, semi-private think tanks existed in Canada – the Conference Board of Canada and the Private Planning Association of Canada (PPAC, renamed the C.D. Howe Institute in 1973). However, by 1983, there were other players in the research mix. Federal government departments had built and were funding their own economics analysis teams sometimes in conflict with the council. As well, the number of private, academic and other non-profit think tanks and policy centres had grown over the previous 20 years, many of them with certain advantages over the council. In particular, in addition to the CD Howe Institute (which began in 1958 as the PPAC as just mentioned), there were three other competing national non-profit think tanks that launched in the early 1970s -- Canada West Foundation in Calgary, Institute for Research on Public Policy (IRPP) in Montreal, and the Fraser Institute in Vancouver—and relied on an endowment or donations, funding sources not open to the council. Also, these research organizations could generally be speedier in their economic commentary, as many were not constrained by the need for the time-consuming activity of consensus-building within their boards when publishing reports, as the council was.

Then, in February 1992, during a period of government expenditure constraint, the federal Minister of Finance, Don Mazankowski, announced in the budget the implementation of streamlining measures to reduce the cost of government. Among the measures implemented were the elimination, consolidation, deferral and privatization of 46 organizations, including the Economic Council of Canada. In this Budget document, two main reasons were given for the closure.

First, the "Situation Report" of the Budget indicated that, though the council had fulfilled its original mandate, hard economic times dictated its elimination: "[It] was created by statute in 1963 with a mandate to provide independent advice to the government on matters related to the growth of Canada's economy. The Council has performed a valuable service over the years, but at this time of restraint, the government has had to carefully assess priorities for the limited funding available for arm's-length research and advice."However, it should pointed that this austerity exercise had been driven by the Department of Finance, which is where, of course, key funding decisions were (and are) made. Given the aforementioned tension between the Council and Finance (and other central government bodies), as to the former's policymaking and independence in doing so, it is perhaps not surprising that, in a time of constraint, Finance would have taken the opportunity to make the decision to cut the Council.

A second justification given by the federal government for closing the Council was lack of need. As observed above, there were few credible economic policy think-tanks in Canada when it was created in 1963, but by the 1980s and 1990s there were several, thus reducing the Council's value added and reducing the effective cost of closing it in 1991. The government believed that the Council's research mandate was being (or could be) met by existing private and non-profit organizations. In its words: "In the years since the creation of the Council, there ha[d] been a considerable growth in the number and quality of organizations and individuals outside government conducting independent research on economic issues." However, it should be said that, since the council's closure, though there have been (and are) well-established public and non-profit think tanks producing policy-relevant research on a range of economic topics, few have had (or have) the resources, or the incentive to focus a significant amount of their resources, on one issue for two or three years using a substantial team of highly paid researchers, as the council had.

No official explanation was ever given for the council's closure, other than the stated fiscal consolidation and perceived lack of rationale. However, a potential reason cited in the press was its estimation of a "low" cost of Quebec separation from Canada, which finding ran counter to the federal government's obvious orientation toward unity. This estimate was presented in what turned out to be the last *Annual Review* of the Economic Council in October,1991. However, this was essentially (and rightly, given the council's mandate) a measure of the economic cost of separation, and, as admitted, did not consider separation's political, social and cultural costs.


## Contributions

Over the council's life, from 1963 to 1992, the council carried out a large amount of research on a wide range of important issues of the day, producing a substantial number of publications, most of which can be obtained on the Government of Canada publications website (see the final section for an elaboration of what the Council published). Out of this research emerged important breakthroughs and messages that, anecdotally, engendered much thought if not political action, and still resonate in the 2020s. Several examples of what the Council contributed follow:

* it contributed to government policy and programming decisions, whereby it was asked, on a number of occasions, to testify and elaborate upon issues (many of which the council would have identified) being deliberated upon by House of Commons and Senate committees, examples including aging, technological change, poverty, and consumer credit;
* it developed, in partnership with a number of government bodies, the CANDIDE forecasting model, one of the first of its kind, which enabled the council and others to effectively conduct longer term analysis;
* it examined and advocated the use of social indicators to better capture Canadians' well-being, beyond the purely economic as the GNP does, in areas such as crime and health;
* it conducted, in the late 1970s, a (then rare) employer-based survey in an era of rising skill shortages that determined that employers were experiencing vacancies mainly for high-skill manufacturing/machining and engineering/science jobs and were dealing with the shortages typically by using only short-term training;
* it analyzed government regulation of the economy and suggested there would be major economic gains from the relaxation of regulatory restrictions, particularly in transportation, telecommunications and agriculture; and from testing and possibly imposing marketable rights in fisheries and trade-able emission incentives in the environmental protection area;
* it advocated for freer trade by identifying its positive impacts on the economy;
* it comprehensively examined two regions of Canada facing economic swings and downturns: the Prairies, specifically the potential need for industrial diversification in light of the region's dependence on oil and gas and other natural resources and the attendant variation in prices and incomes; and Newfoundland, specifically the need for new measures in the province in the face of the cod fishery collapse and the seemingly perpetual cycle of unemployment and low productivity;
* it emphasized competition policies to improve market efficiency, which led to the establishment of a new Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and changes to the Combines Act;
* it observed rapid demographic and industrial changes in the mid-1960s and identified the need for greater labour supply management, which led to the creation of the then federal Department of Manpower and Immigration and the implementation of various human resource programs by the department, as well as greater public support for education and training and job-oriented training in post-secondary institutions;
* very topically now in the 2020s as the post-War Baby Boomers age, it analyzed the effects of population aging on seniors' income support and overall health care costs;
* in the mid-1980s, it was one the first organizations to quantify the rapid changes in technology occurring in the workplace, along with the differences in their impacts according to industry, occupation, skill level, gender, and earnings level; and the need for adjustment to the changes as to training, transfers and layoffs, and organizational changes;
* in light of rapid changes in goods and service production in the 1980s and early 1990s, it conducted a survey of employers experiencing rapid technological change and observed the consequent greater use of innovative workplace human-resource management practices, such as variable pay and flexible scheduling, some of which had positive effects on firms and workers in terms of, for example, lower turnover and job stress and higher wages and skills and productivity;
* it documented the changing face of immigration and its positive effects on the economy;
* it documented the changing composition of those in poverty and their income security needs;
* its research pointed to the value of community-level economic development;
* it documented the growing service sector in the 1980s and the impact this was having on the labour market and job quality, in terms of skills, wages, benefits, training, tenure and working conditions; and
* in a comprehensive examination of the way the education and training systems prepare youth for employment, it identified a number of ways to measure and improve the transition, in the areas of achievement (e.g., reduced literacy and drop-outs), job preparation (e.g., higher placement and skilled instructors), and greater accessibility as to females, indigenous peoples and income).
