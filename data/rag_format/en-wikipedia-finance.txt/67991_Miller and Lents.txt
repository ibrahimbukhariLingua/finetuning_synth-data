## History

In 1948, J. R. Butler and Martin Miller formed an oil and gas consulting partnership known as J. R. Butler and Company. Max Lents, who was not a partner at the beginning of J. R. Butler and Company, was considered as an original founding partner when he joined the firm a year later. The company name then changed to Butler, Miller and Lents.

In 1970 its name was changed to Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd., at which time it became a Subchapter S Corporation.

In 1976, the name of the firm was changed to its current name, Miller and Lents, Ltd. after J. R. Butler exchanged his interest in Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd.
