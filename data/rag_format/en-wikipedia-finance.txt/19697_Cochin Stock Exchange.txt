Cochin Stock Exchange was established in 1978.

During the 1990s, it was the fourth largest exchange in India by turnover, with a daily turnover of ₹70–₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹596 crore or US$69 million in 2023), with 476 Indian companies listed.

Computerized trading was introduced in 1997. The major back office system software used are NESS and BOSS respectively for NSE and BSE. The trading software used in CSBL was Multex, developed by CMC. Traders are provided Meta Stock and ERS software, trading terminals and optical fiber connections. DP holdings are maintained by demat services like CDSL.

The new millennium saw the stock exchange building being shifted from the old structure to a brand new building in the Kaloor area in northern Kochi.

Trading hours historically used to begin late in the afternoon enabling access to traders from other regions of the state. Base Minimum Capital required to be maintained is Rs. 2 lakhs.

The securities scam of the early nineties led the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations on stock exchanges requires separation of ownership and trading rights and made it mandatory for majority ownership rests with the public, those without any trading rights.

The exchange stopped trading in 2005, and closing procedures after the SEBI introduced a minimum net worth requirement of ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹170 crore or US$20 million in 2023) and a turnover of ₹1,000 crore (equivalent to ₹17 billion or US$200 million in 2023) for stock exchanges to continue operation in 2013. It was in the final stages of closure by May 2014.


## Economic impact

Industrialisation did not happen in Kerala to the extent as in other Indian states. The reasons for the failure to attract manufacturing industries was due to the political climate and the lack of resources in a small state with such a large population density. The stock exchange served as a channel for investors to find investment opportunities.
