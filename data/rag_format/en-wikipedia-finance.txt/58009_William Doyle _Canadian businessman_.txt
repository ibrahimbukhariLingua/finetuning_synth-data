## CEO of PotashCorp

He was on PotashCorp's board of directors since the company was first listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges in 1989. While CEO of PotashCorp, Doyle led the company to become "an agribusiness powerhouse that controls some of the most valuable and coveted assets on Earth." With a market capitalization of less than $625-million when it went public in 1989, PotashCorp now has a market capitalization of approximately $33-billion USD.

During his time as CEO, Doyle oversaw the growth of PotashCorp from C$1.35 billion to C$32.46 billion.

Under the terms of this partnership, PotashCorp will contribute up to $35 million over seven years to the Global Institute for Food Security, with the Government of Saskatchewan providing up to $15 million over the same period.
