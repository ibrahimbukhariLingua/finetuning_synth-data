## Etihad

In January 2017, the Etihad Airways management team consisted of Peter Baumgartner as CEO and Richard Hill as COO; James Hogan as CEO and CFO of the Etihad Group had resigned. Baumgartner stated that in May 2017, the partnership with the Special Olympics was a step forward for Etihad Avitation Group's social activities program.

## Conferences

## Controversy

In July 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), lifted UEFA's 2018 Manchester City ban from the Champions League for violation of its financial fair play rules and judging that City's Abu Dhabi ownership had unfairly sponsored the club by channeling money through the state's commercial companies passing them on as independent sponsorship. CAS found that "most of the alleged breaches were either not established or time-barred" and at the same time reduced the club's fine by two thirds. However according to Spiegel, there were doubts about the CAS verdict as it emerged that in December 2013 City director Simon Pearce had sent an email to Baumgartner, with the subject "Payments". In this further leaked email from Pearce, who was also a senior executive in an Abu Dhabi government authority, to Baumgartner, Etihad's chief commercial officer at the time, Pearce confirmed that he was "forwarding" the airline GBP 91 million of GBP 99 million that Etihad owed to the club for its sponsorship, with Etihad merely providing GBP 8 million.
