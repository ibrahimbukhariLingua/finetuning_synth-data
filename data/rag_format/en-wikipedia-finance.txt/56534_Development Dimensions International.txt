## Company Overview

DDI was founded in 1970 by William C. Byham, and Douglas Bray. DDI introduced the assessment center approach for identifying leadership skills. Byham’s article, *Assessment Centers for Spotting Future Managers* (*Harvard Business Review),* led to inquiries about the process, and later, Byham approached Bray about a partnership.

DDI later branched out into leadership development. It introduced a leadership development program based on behavior modeling: Interaction Management. DDI next created a stand-alone behavioral interviewing system, Targeted Selection, which ensures compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity laws.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
