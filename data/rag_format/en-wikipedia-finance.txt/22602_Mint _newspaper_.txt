# Mint (newspaper)



***Mint*** is an Indian business and financial daily newspaper published by HT Media, a Delhi-based media group which is controlled by the K. K. Birla family. The K. K. Birla family also publishes *Hindustan Times*. Mint has been running since 2007 and specializes in business and politics.

It publishes a single national edition distributed in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Ahmedabad and Chandigarh. Mint is not published on Sunday. Every Saturday, it prints its sister magazine, Mint Lounge. It was India's first newspaper to be published in the Berliner format. The former editor of the *Wall Street Journal India*, Raju Narisetti ran *Mint* from its founding in 2007 to 2008. Narisetti was succeeded by Sukumar Ranganathan, who served as an editor until 2017.

In 2014, *Mint* and the *Journal* ended their seven-year editorial partnership. The companies now have a content syndication agreement as well as a subscriptions bundle. In 2017, former editor of *Khaleej Times* Vinay R. Kamat was appointed as Editor, replacing Sukumar Ranganathan. In November 2020, Sruthijith Kurupichankandy, better known as SK, was appointed Editor-in-chief.


## History


### Launch

*Mint* began in collaboration with *The Wall Street Journal* on 1 February 2007, with the *Journal*'s former deputy managing editor, Raju Narisetti as its founding editor.


### Relaunch

In 2016, *Mint* changed from the Berliner format it popularised in India and became a broadsheet. *Mint* also publishes *Mint Lounge* as a Saturday cultural edition.


## Website

After struggling in the initial years, the Livemint website is now the second most read business news website in India, behind *The Economic Times*. After HT Media Limited acquired VCCircle from News Corp in 2020, the Livemint website also shares content with the VCCircle and TechCircle websites. The Deals, Tech and Startups page on the *Mint* newspaper routinely gets content from both VCCircle and TechCircle.
