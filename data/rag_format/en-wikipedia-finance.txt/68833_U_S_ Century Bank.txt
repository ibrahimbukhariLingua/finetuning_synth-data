**Early years**

U.S. Century Bank, which has a majority Hispanic board of directors, was established in 2002 with $23 million in capital to provide financial services to Hispanic-owned businesses. Through organic growth, the bank rose to $2 billion in assets by 2009.

During the economic downturn in 2009, the bank participated in the United States Department of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program, receiving $5. In 2011, the U.S. Treasury appointed a federal observer to the bank's board after the bank missed eight TARP dividend payments. The FDIC in 2011 issued a consent order citing issues with asset quality, management, earnings, capital, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. U.S. Century regained profitability in 2010 and closed 2011 with $1.26 billion in deposits and $1.11 billion in loans.

On December 12, 2013, U.S. Century Bank named former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida R. Alexander Acosta as chairman. Acosta was head prosecutor in the region from 2005 until 2009, after which he accepted the position of dean at Florida International University’s law school.

U.S. Century Bank announced the closing of its $65 million re-capitalization on March 18, 2015, after two previous attempts. It announced regulatory approval on Feb. 20, 2015, and gained shareholders’ approval on March 9, 2015.

The bank’s executive management turned over in December 2015 when Luis de la Aguilera, former head of TotalBank, was appointed president and chief executive officer. In April 2016, after the changes in management and restructuring of the bank’s loan portfolio, the bank returned to profitability and the FDIC lifted the regulatory consent order under which the bank had been operating.

The board of directors named Aida Levitan, Ph.D., as chairman of the board in 2017, replacing Alexander Acosta, who had been confirmed as U.S. secretary of labor on April 27, 2017, by the U.S. Senate.
