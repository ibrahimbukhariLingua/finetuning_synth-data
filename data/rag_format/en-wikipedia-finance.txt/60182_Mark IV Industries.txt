## History

Mark IV Industries was one of the region's fastest-growing companies in the 1990s. At its peak, it operated 37 manufacturing facilities, 26 distribution outlets, and 9 technical centers around the world. Recently, however, the company has struggled with high debt loads. In April 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors, listing assets of $500 million and debt of more than $1 billion. After six-months in Chapter 11, Mark IV had eliminated approximately $750 million in debt and liabilities, and emerged in November 2009 as a newly reorganized company. The company has, however, found itself at the adverse end of a legal trend which strongly enforces environmental protection, as a judge of the Southern District of New York has found that the governmentâ€™s right to an injunction to force an environmental cleanup is not a claim that can be discharged under the Bankruptcy Code.
