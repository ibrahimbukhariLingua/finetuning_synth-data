Green America


# Green America



**Green America** (known as **Co-op America** until January 1, 2009) is a nonprofit membership organization based in the United States that promotes environmentally aware, ethical consumerism. It was founded in 1982 by Paul Freundlich to help consumers find environmentally compliant companies in the marketplace. Green America provides businesses with the Green America Seal of Approval, after completing Green America's screening process and have been approved to be listed in their National Green Pages directory. The Green America Approved seal is given to applicant businesses that operate in ways that support workers, communities, and protect the environment.


## History

Co-op America (now Green America) had its roots in the environmental and social justice movements of the '70s. Founder Paul Freundlich thought that there was a significant segment of Americans who had been changed by the culture of recent decades, yet had not found a way to express that in their lives. Some regional businesses had grown out of similar values, yet lacked access to a customer base sufficient for growth. Co-op America began as a collaborative marketplace, speaking to the shared interests of consumers and business, by a staff and an elected governance structure. Co-op America published a quarterly journal, *Building Economic Alternatives*, and a catalog of goods and services.

Co-op America received support from Consumers United's President, James P. Gibbons. The Co-op Catalog was developed and supervised by Denise Hamler, who joined the staff in 1982, and has continued to manage major programs including National Green Pages and Green Festivals. In 2016, Denise Hamler retired from Green America after 34 years.

Alisa Gravitz became a consultant in 1983 and in 1990 succeeded Paul Freundlich as executive director. Paul remained on the board of directors as founder and president emeritus.
