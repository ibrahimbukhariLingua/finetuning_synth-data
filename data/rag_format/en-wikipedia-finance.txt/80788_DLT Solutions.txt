## History

DLT Solutions was founded in 1991 by Thomas J. Marrelli. DLT Solutions is a value-added reseller of software and hardware and professional services provider in Herndon, Virginia. In July 2004, Rick Marcotte was appointed DLT's president and CEO after having been on its board of directors for a year. After Marrelli died in 2002, his heirs in 2005 sold the company to DLT President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Marcotte and Chief Financial Officer Craig Adler. During the acquisition, SunTrust Banks handled the financing, while BB&T Capital Markets and Windsor Group advised DLT Solutions. Marcotte had worked with the founder, Thomas Marrelli, in the mid-1990s when Marrelli led Exide Electronics' federal systems branch and Marcotte was the new business development director. In 2005, the company resold products from Oracle Corporation, Autodesk, Quest Solutions, Red Hat and Adobe Systems.

The company mostly works with groups in the public sector such as the United States Department of Defense and local and state administrations. In 2013, after federal spending shrunk, DLT's work with local and state governments increased more than with the federal government. DLT scored a contract with Colorado to install Oracle software for its health insurance marketplace. In 2014, DLT's main vendors were Autodesk, Dell Software, Red Hat, Oracle Corporation, and Symantec, which DLT used for 80% of its enterprises.
