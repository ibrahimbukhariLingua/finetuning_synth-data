# Solomon Partners



**Solomon Partners**, previously known as **PJ Solomon** and/or **Peter J. Solomon Company**, is an independently operated American investment bank and financial services company headquartered in New York City. Solomon Partners advises on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings, recapitalizations, SPACs and capital markets.


## History

Solomon Partners was founded in 1989 by Peter J. Solomon. It was one of the first private independent investment banking firms on Wall Street. Originally, nearly all investment banks were privately held; by the time of the creation of Solomon Partners, most of the larger investment banks had gone public. The motivating idea behind the creation of Solomon Brothers was that it would "mirror the ethos and culture" of the original privately held investment banks.

Solomon Partners is headquartered in New York City and has additional offices in Chicago and Miami.

In June 2016, Solomon Partners (at the time known as PJ SOLOMON) entered into an alliance with Natixis, a French financial services firm owned by Groupe BPCE, to expand its global M&A advisory and financing platform.

In September 2021, the company changed its name to Solomon Partners.


## Transactions

Solomon Partners' practices cover a number of investment verticals including business services, consumer retail, industrials, financial sponsors, financial services and fintech, grocery, pharmacy, restaurants, healthcare, infrastructure, power, renewables, media, technology, and telecommunications.
