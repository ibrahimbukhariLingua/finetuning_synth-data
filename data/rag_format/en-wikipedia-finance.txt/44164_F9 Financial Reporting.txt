F9 Financial Reporting


# F9 Financial Reporting



**F9** is a financial reporting software application that dynamically links general ledger data to Microsoft Excel through the use of financial cell-based formulas, wizards, and analysis tools to create spreadsheet reports that can be calculated, filtered, and drilled upon. The F9 software is developed, marketed, and support by an organization also called F9, a division of Infor Global Solutions (Canada) Ltd. which is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia.


## History

**F9 - The Financial Reporter** was originally developed by Synex Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of Synex International (Symbol SXI, TSX). First announced in 1988 as Acclink for Accpac as a Lotus 1-2-3 Add-in for DOS and released under F9 name later in 1989. Subsequently F9 was developed for the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet Platform.

F9 was developed to allow a non-technical user, typically an accountant, to create a dynamic, customized general ledger financial report using a spreadsheet that is 'hot-linked' to an accounting system's general ledger.

Initially, the user interface used the same syntax as Accpac for specifying the reporting period. This was soon replaced by a simpler to understand and more flexible generic natural language interface that used a temporal trinary (three part) phrase parsing syntax composed of a modifier, a period specifier, and a temporal index. For example: "starting balance last quarter" is broken down to 'starting balance' (modifier) + 'last' (temporal index) + 'quarter' (period). The temporal index can be relative or absolute and the modifier can determine if the value returned is differential or cumulative.

The first F9 addin was a significant software effort in that it used a coding trick to break the small memory model limit 1-2-3 imposed on addins and allowed F9 to be run as a compact memory model program. This allowed F9 to be written in C (using a Microsoft C DOS compiler) rather than assembler allowing easier changes and debugging.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

An F9 addin was developed for Excel in 1989 and with the lack of a 1-2-3 version that supported Windows and problems with the Lotus Programming Language (LPL) the Excel version of F9 soon far outsold the 1-2-3 version.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On or about the year 2002 F9 was renamed 'F9 - Financial Intelligence.'ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2002, Synex Systems was acquired by privately owned Lasata Software of Perth, Australia. In 2005, Lasata was acquired by UK based Systems Union. In 2007, Systems Union was acquired by privately held Infor Global Solutions, a U.S. company that specializes in enterprise software.

What was Synex Systems Corporation now operates as an independent business unit (IBU) within Infor Global Solutions called F9.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

As of 2012 F9 was used by over 30,000 financial accounting professionals in more than 20 countries worldwide and was named one of Accounting Today's "Top 100 Software Products" for 2001.
