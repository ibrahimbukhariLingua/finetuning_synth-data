Egypt–European Union relations


# Egypt–European Union relations



Foreign relations between the country of Egypt and the European Union (EU) are framed by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the EU-Egypt Association Agreement. Both sides share a common membership in the Union for the Mediterranean which seeks to promote cooperation and dialogue in the Euro-Mediterranean region. Relations between Egypt and the EU focus mainly on strengthening economic ties as well as enhancing regional stability and migration management.


## History

Under the aegis of the Global Mediterranean Policy (GMP) launched in 1972, the European Economic Community and Egypt signed an agreement in January 1977, marking the start of the EU pursuing a long-term policy in the Mediterranean.

The framework laid out in the 1995 Euro-Mediterranean Partnership paved the way for some modest advances in the EU–Egypt relations. A new Association Agreement signed on 25 June 2001 entered into force in June 2004 and established a free trade area (FTA) between the EU and Egypt. In 2010, this was extended to include agricultural, processed agricultural and fisheries products. While talks began in June 2013 to establish a Deep and Comprehensive FTA, negotiations are currently on hold. An EU–Egypt Action Plan also entered into force in March 2007, offering a €558 million financial assistance package for the 2007–2010 period to promote a more progressive integration and assist political, economic and social reform.

The outbreak of the Arab Spring in the early 2010s defied the traditional stability-driven policy conducted in the region by the EU. Conveyed by the support of authoritarian rulers in office, including Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, this eventually led to a reassessment of the EU foreign policy in the region.

In 2020, the EU and Egypt celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Barcelona Process. Inspired by this milestone, the EU launched the revised Agenda for the Mediterranean and its Economic and Investment Plan for the Southern Neighbourhood on 9 February 2021 to help foster prosperity and stability in the region as well as strengthen their partnership. In 2023, the European Commission and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi negotiated the creation of a "strategic partnership" between the EU and Egypt. They agreed on an EU funding package of €1 billion in 2024, with the first instalment received by Egypt in January 2025.


## Fields of Cooperation


### Trade

The EU is Egypt’s most important trading partner, making up 25% of the country’s trade volume in 2023. In the same year, trade in goods between both sides equalled €26.4 billion. The biggest export categories in 2023 were chemical products and manufactured goods. The EU's biggest service exports to Egypt include telecommunication, transport and various other business services; Egypt's exports to the EU are largely transport and travel services.


### Culture

Egyptian students can participate in the European Commission's Erasmus+ program. Between 2014 and 2022, 6371 Egyptian students, professors and university staff members travelled to Europe while 2980 of their European counterparts travelled to Egypt through the program.
