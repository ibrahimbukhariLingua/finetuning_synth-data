NEOMA BS offers a wide range of educational programmes covering all fields of management such as bachelor's degrees, Master in Management, MBA and EMBA programs, specialized MSc programs, a PhD in management, and various executive education offerings. The school is consistently rated by the Financial Times, The Economist and Challenges as one of the top business schools in continental Europe and one of the leading business schools worldwide.

## History

The Advanced Business School of Rouen was created in 1873, in the Normandy's region. It took the name Rouen Business School at the beginning of the new millennium.

The Advanced Business School of Reims was created in 1928, in the Champagne's region. It took the name Reims Management School at the beginning of the new millennium.

NEOMA Business School was created at the start of the 2013 school year following the merger of the two middle schools. This merger was carried out by the regional Reims and Rouen Chambers of Commerce and Industry.


## Grande école degrees

NEOMA Business School is a *grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. *Grandes écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France.

The degrees are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the *Licence* / Bachelor's degrees, and the Master's and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various "parcours" or paths based on UE (Unités d'enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Bachelors is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (Grand Ecole Program) ends with the degree of Master's in Management (MiM)
