# Digital Federal Credit Union



**Digital Federal Credit Union** (**DCU**) is a credit union based in Marlborough, Massachusetts.

It has over 1,025,000 members and is the largest credit union headquartered in New England as measured by assets, managing over US $9.9 billion. DCU is regulated under the authority of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) of the US federal government.

DCU has nineteen full-service branches in Massachusetts and four full-service branches in New Hampshire, although it has members in all 50 U.S. states.

On September 30, 2024, DCU announced it was merging with First Tech Credit Union. The new credit union would retain DCU's charter while keeping First Tech's name. The merger is subject to regulatory approval from the NCUA and the anticipated integration date is late 2025. The merger will create the 6th largest Credit Union in the United States by assets, and a coast-to-coast branch network.


## History

DCU was chartered in 1979 for employees of Digital Equipment Corporation following complaints to CEO Ken Olsen that employees had been having difficulty securing mortgages.
