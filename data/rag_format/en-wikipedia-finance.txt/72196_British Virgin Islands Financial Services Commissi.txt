# British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission



The **BVI Financial Services Commission** is an autonomous regulatory authority responsible for the regulation, supervision and inspection of all the British Virgin Islands financial services including insurance, banking, trustee business, company management, mutual funds business, the registration of companies, limited partnerships and intellectual property.

It was established in 2001 pursuant to the Financial Services Commission Act, 2001. The commission now oversees all regulatory responsibilities previously handled by the government through its Financial Services Department; protecting the independence of financial services regulation and fulfilling international commitments to the prevention of international white collar crime while safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of legitimate business transactions.

The commission also has new responsibilities including promoting public understanding of the financial system and its products, policing the perimeter of regulated activity, reducing financial crime and preventing market abuse.

The British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission launched its Asia representative office in Hong Kong in April 2014 as part of a broader effort to support business development in the Asia Pacific Region.
