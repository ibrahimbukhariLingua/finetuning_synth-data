Mercosur Cities Network


# Mercosur Cities Network



**Mercosur Cities Network**, or simply **Mercocities**, is a network that unites a group of municipalities of the countries that participate in the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), whether they are members or associates. This organization of cities aims to promote their integration on a regional scale and stimulate development and cooperation between them.

It currently comprises 353 municipalities of the following South American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.


## History

The idea of creating a Mercosur association of cities came up during the seminar "Mercosur: Opportunities and Challenges for Cities" held in March 1995 in Asunción, Paraguay. The mayors who participated in the meeting, which was convened by the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities–Southern Cone Sub-region, signed the so-called Declaration of Asuncion, where they expressed the need to create a forum for cooperation among municipalities.

In July 1995, the Porto Alegre Commitment (Brazil) was signed, which defined the main objectives of the new organization. Finally, in November of the same year, she signed the Founding Act of the Mercocities, in Asunción.

The founding members were the cities of Asunción, Rosario, La Plata, Cordoba, Buenos Aires, Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Salvador and Montevideo.


## Instances of Mercociudades

Art. 8 of the Statutes stated different instances of work:


### Summit of Heads of Government

The Assembly is the highest body for deliberation and direction of our Network. It is made up of mayors, mayors and prefects of the associated cities and its sessions are led by the President of Mercociudades. It meets once a year at the Mercocities Summit.
During the Assembly the annual Work Plan is approved, the authorities of that new period assume, and it is at the same time an instance of contact with various regional and world organizations interested in carrying out joint actions. The Assembly concludes with a political declaration.

Its mandate is for one year and begins from the date the General Assembly is held.


### Collegiate of Coordinators of Thematic Units: Thematic Units

The thematic instances disseminate successful experiences, contribute to the formulation of public policies, and promote research.

### Permanent Technical Secretariat

The Permanent Technical Secretariat of Mercocities is based in Montevideo and is an advisory body to the Executive Secretariat.
