Gambling in Australia


# Gambling in Australia



Gambling is an activity undertaken by many Australians. In 2022, 72.8% of Australian adults gambled within the previous 12 months (80.5% for men and 66.2% for women) and 38% of Australian adults gambled at least once per week (48% for men and 28% for women). In 2017, Australians were estimated to lead the world with the highest gambling losses on a per-capita basis. Australians spend more on online gambling than any other country in the world.

On a per-capita basis, Australians placed gambling bets worth AUD$9,885 in financial year 2020-2021, resulting in a loss of AUD$1,200. Australians cumulatively placed bets worth AUD$198 billion in this financial year, resulting in a total loss of AUD$24 billion.

Gambling is a significant public health issue, with around 80,000 to 160,000 (or 0.5–1.0%) of Australian adults experiencing significant problems from gambling and a further 250,000 to 350,000 (or 1.4–2.1% of adults) experiencing moderate risks that may make them vulnerable to problem gambling.


## Revenue

In 2015–16, gambling revenue made up 7.7% of state and territory taxation revenue. The rate was lowest in Western Australia (2.5%) and highest in the Northern Territory (12.0%). Gambling revenue made up 2.5% of total state revenue when other revenue sources were taken into account. The rate was lowest in WA (0.9%) and highest in Victoria (3.2%). Gambling revenue as a portion of state taxation revenue has fallen for all states and territories between 2006–07 and 2015–16.

Total Australian gambling revenue in 2008–09 was just over $19 billion and the share of household consumption was 3.1%. According to the Queensland Government the total Australian gambling market was worth over $25 billion in 2019. During the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 the proportion of online gamblers rose to 78% while half of the Australians gamble on a regular basis.


## Forms of gambling


### Electronic gaming machines

Electronic gaming machines are commonly referred to within Australia as "pokies" or "poker machines". Electronic gaming machines are operated in all states of Australia as well as the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory. Each jurisdiction separately regulates the design and operation of electronic gaming machines. In the financial year 2020-2021, Australians placed bets worth almost AUD$150 billion through electronic gaming machines, resulting in a total player loss of AUD$12 billion for the year. Per-capita, losses for financial year 2020-2021 were AUD$608, amounting to approximately half of the AUD$1200 losses per-capita for all forms of gambling.

## Advertising

Advertising for gambling is legal in Australia. However, in 2023, a parliamentary committee recommended a ban on gambling advertising during sporting events.

In 2024, ministers of the Albanese government discussed a ban during sporting events. The government briefed lobbyists about the policy before briefing the Labor party caucus, which inspired internal dissent, with one MP calling the move "disgusting".

The government expressed concerns over impacts to the profitability of free-to-air television. Labor minister Bill Shorten expressed doubts about the ban, while Jacqui Lambie accused the government of lacking courage. In response to concerns about network profitability, the Australia Institute proposed a new levy on gambling revenue, which could cover the losses.

As of October 2024, the government of prime minister Anthony Albanese is planning to implement a total ban on digital gambling ads and a prohibition on TV ads for one hour before and after sports broadcasts.


## New South Wales

New South Wales has a long history of gambling; Australia's first official horse racing meeting occurred in 1810 at Hyde Park in Sydney; the first official Australian lottery occurred in 1881 at the Sydney Cup; and registered clubs operated the first legal poker machines in Australia from 1956.

There are approximately 95,800 "pokies" in NSW, a state total beaten only by Nevada, which operated 181,109 gambling machines in 2014.

Between 1 December 2017 and 31 May 2018 NSW Clubs made a net profit of $1,945,161,625 and hotels made a net profit of $1,169,040,731 from pokies alone.


### Fairfield

Fairfield had the highest poker machine revenue in the state for 2013, generating $298 million in clubs and $93 million in pubs, from the start of the year to August. This figure is $123 million greater than the combined total of profits generated from poker machines in the City of Sydney.


### Hunter Region

From January to March 2013 poker machines in the Hunter region had a turn over of $4.5 billion, showing an increase of $500 million since 2010. Daily figures show a spend of $12.5 million, working out to be $8682 per minute. The Office of Liquor Gaming and Racing found that Newcastle was the Hunter Regions most profitable location with the 3206 poker machines averaging $44,963 each.
The top five most profitable clubs for gaming revenue in the Hunter region in 2010 were:

* 1. Western Suburbs Leagues Club (Wests), New Lambton
* 2. Wests (formerly Club Phoenix), Mayfield
* 3. Wallsend RSL & Community Club, Wallsend
* 4. Belmont 16 Foot Sailing Club, Belmont
* 5. Cardiff Panthers, Cardiff

The top five most profitable hotels for gaming revenue in the Hunter region in 2010 were.

* 1. The George Tavern, East Maitland
* 2. Bay Hotel Motel, Bonnells Bay
* 3. Hotel Jesmond, Jesmond
* 4. The Lake Macquarie Tavern, Mount Hutton
* 5. Warners Bay Hotel, Warners Bay

### Central Coast Region

According to the latest figures from Liquor and Gaming NSW there are 4,046 poker machines in 39 clubs on the Central Coast, and 626 poker machines in 29 hotels; making a total of 4,672 poker machines on the Central Coast. That means 2.37% of the total number of poker machines in Australia are on the NSW Central Coast.

Gosford has approximately 1928 pokies, spread across 37 venues. That is the equivalent of one poker machine for every 71 adults. In 2010–11, venues in Gosford made approximately $95,865,000 in profit from pokies. That equates to $700 for each adult member of Gosford's population.

Wyong has approximately 2608 pokies, spread across 35 venues. That is the equivalent of one poker machine for every 47 adults. In 2010–11, venues in Wyong made approximately $123,159,000 in profit from pokies. That equates to $1,000 for each adult member of Wyong's population.

The Central Coast has a higher prevalence of problem gambling than the NSW average. Young men between the ages of 18 and 24 living on the Central Coast are the biggest players of poker machines in NSW and are the highest risk group for problem gambling.

In 2008 Central Coast Gambling Help carried out a survey of 200 young people aged from 13–24 and found:

* 96% of people from 18–24 had gambled for money or possessions
* 62% of those under 14 years old and 77% of those aged up to 17 had gambled for money or items, including mobile phones and MP3 players
* 25.5% of 14- to 17-year-olds and 55% of 18- to 24-year-olds had lost more than they had intended
* and 6% under 18 had played a poker machine

## Regulatory authorities

Since the introduction of new gambling services, including online gambling, the Commonwealth has taken a more active role in the regulation of gambling, but the Australian gambling industry is also regulated by State and Territory authorities:

* Australian Capital Territory – ACT Gambling and Racing Commission
* New South Wales – Liquor and Gaming NSW
* Northern Territory – Licensing Commission
* Queensland – Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation
* South Australia – Independent Gambling Authority
* Tasmania – Tasmanian Gaming Commission
* Victoria – Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission
* Western Australia – Department of Racing, Gaming and Liquor

## Self-regulatory government initiatives

In August 2023, a federal self-exclusion registry known as "BetStop" was introduced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. All betting providers in Australia are required to verify customers against the registry, and must not allow users to create an account or receive marketing communications if a match is detected. At least 18,000 users registered within its first six months of operation. The project was first recommended by Barry O'Farrell as part of a 2015 review; it was originally intended to launch in 2022, but was delayed after the technology provider that was originally contracted to develop the registry went into administration.

## Online gambling

The Interactive Gambling Act (2001) was passed by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament on 28 June 2001. It received assent on 11 July 2001

The Act is targeted at online gambling operators, making it an offense for them to offer 'real-money' online interactive gambling to residents of Australia. It also makes it illegal for online gambling operators to advertise 'real-money' interactive gambling services (such as online poker and online casinos) to Australian citizens.
That being said, the amount spent on online gaming by Australians reached some $800 million by 2010, according to the official 2010 Productivity Report of the Australian Government. Australian gamblers wager nearly $250 billions annually.

Accessing and using the interactive gambling services is not an offence. It is also allowed to companies based in Australia to offer their gambling services to gamblers located outside Australia with the exception of those countries that were called 'designated countries' like Australia.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has announced that all online gambling service providers must complete applicable customer identification procedures (ACIP) before establishing accounts or offering designated services. This requirement came into effect on September 29, 2024, and aims to prevent criminal exploitation while ensuring compliance with the National Self Exclusion Register. Companies are now obligated to verify customer identities and conduct thorough checks as part of the ACIP process prior to providing any services. Although the changes were initially introduced in September 2023, providers were given a year to adjust their systems accordingly. This new regulation significantly helps safeguard the integrity of online gambling services in Australia.


## Taxation laws on gambling in Australia

Gamblers' winnings in Australia are not taxed. There are 3 main reasons for that:

* Gambling is not considered a profession, it's treated as a hobby or recreational activity.
* The Australian government views gains from gambling activities not as income, but as a result of good luck. Even if someone wins big, they also lose a lot in other gambling sessions.
* The government taxes gambling operators instead.

Taxation of gambling operators in Australia differs from state to state and different gambling services are taxed in a different way. There are taxes on the turnover, on player loss and net profit. As gambling operators need to obtain a licence to offer their services, certain fees must also be paid at this stage of gambling business development.

The use of different tax rates and tax bases makes it difficult to compare taxes across states. For example, the ACT's keno tax rate of 2.53% of turnover is equivalent to a tax rate on gross profits of 10.12%.
