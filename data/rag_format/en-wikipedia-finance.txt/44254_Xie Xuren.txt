## Policies and reform


### Abolishment of agricultural taxes

In 2005, in about 28 provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities), the agricultural taxes were cancelled. From 1949 to 2005, the total income of China's national agricultural taxes was about 420 billion yuan.

On 1 January 2006, the old regulations and laws about agricultural taxes were abolished, since then all agricultural taxes (except for tobacco) have been cancelled in mainland China, thus ended China's 2600-year history of agricultural taxes.


### Revenue

In 2007, China's revenue reached a new historic height at 5.13 trillion yuan.

Although since late 2008, China has also been heavily influenced by the Global financial crisis of 2008–2009, Xie stated on January 5, 2009 that 2008 China's revenue (tax income) "are expected to breakthrough 6 trillion yuan", which would be an over 20% increase of 2007.
