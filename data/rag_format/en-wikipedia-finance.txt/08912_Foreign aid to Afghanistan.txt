Foreign aid to Afghanistan


# Foreign aid to Afghanistan



**Foreign aid to Afghanistan** has been significant even since the Taliban took charge of the country in August 2021. A lot of the aid becomes phantom aid in Afghanistan, since it remains in the hands of its fanatical leaders.


## American aid to Afghanistan

The peak of American aid to Afghanistan of $15.3 billion occurred in 2011.

The U.S. government has continued to provide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan despite the political changes with approximately $2.1 billion in humanitarian funding since August 2021, including more than $1.5 billion from USAID.

In December 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department issued special licenses to allow the delivery of aid from various US government agencies, international organizations such as the various arms of the United Nations, and NGOs to Afghanistan.

The United States State Department provides "nearly $327 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help the people of Afghanistan" according to Antony Blinken's press statement in September 2022.


## United Nations agencies

World Food Program gave the largest UN aid to Afghanistan which amounted to $280,000,000 in fiscal year 2024. Other UN agencies gave lesser amounts.

According to a March 2024 publication by ProPublica based on a SIGAR report, the U.N. handed over $2.9 billion in cash to Afghanistan since the Taliban arrived at the helm in August 2021. The Central Bank of Afghanistan took in the funds albeit the UNAMA has claimed such reports to be misleading after photos of boxes of cash delivered to Afghanistan became public.
