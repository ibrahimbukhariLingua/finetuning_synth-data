# List of production companies owned by the American Broadcasting Company



The American Broadcasting Company has formed a number of production companies since its formation in 1943 and under various parent companies and owners up until the present day under ownership by the Walt Disney Company. ABC Film Syndication, or ABC Films, was ABC's syndication distribution arm from 1953 to 1971 when the FCC passed the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (best known simply as the *fin-syn rules*). As a result, ABC Films was sold to 5 of its former executives and changed name to Worldvision Enterprises. ABC's current primary production company is 20th Television.

A number of production companies were formed under Capital Cities/ABC Video Enterprises, Capital Cities/ABC Video Productions (both were reorganized and absorbed into ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group, which changed name to Disney Media Distribution in 2011 and currently Disney Platform Distribution since 2020 upon Capital Cities/ABC's merger with Disney), Ultra Entertainment, the Hemisphere Group and DIC Entertainment.

Disney took over ownership upon its purchase of CC/ABC. DDE, a unit of Buena Vista International Television, in February 1999 took over distribution, management and operation of ABC/Kane Productions International. In 2001, DDE began looking for a new owner as Disney is in the movie business with Alliance Atlantis Communications and Granada begin front runners.

### ABC News Productions

ABC News Productions was formed in 1994. In August 2006, ABCNP was placed into ABC News All Media along with the ABC News production unit.


### ABC Motion Pictures

**ABC Motion Pictures** was a production company of ABC that operated from May 1979. 20th Century Fox was the company's distributor. Until October 1985, the division produced theatrical films along with TV movies, series and mini-series.

**ABC Motion Pictures** was founded in May 1979 with Brandon Stoddard as president. Soon the division was swapped with old film projects. While a boutique would make only a few films per year, Stoddard figured that ABC would succeed in movie production as there were additional revenue sources from video cassettes and cable on top of theater ticket sales and broadcast TV sales. ABC Motion Pictures was incorporated by June 11, 1980.

The division waited two years to get its first slate of three films into production with National Lampoon's Class Reunion just an announcement and *Young Doctors in Love* beginning production in December 1981 under the theatrical directorial debut of Garry Marshall. In June 1982, "Chain Reaction" (later "Silkwood") starring Meryl Streep was expected to be in production.

*The Flamingo Kid* after released by Fox did well but not strong business, Fox pulled the film from release so as to stop spending money on advertising.

With networks getting better rating for their own movies of the week over films released on cable and cassettes, networks reduced licensing of theatrical films. Additional boutique production companies entered the market at the same time crowding the market and increasing filming costs. With films distributed by a major studio, ABC's films were slotted in less desirable release dates. On October 28, 1985, ABC shut down ABC Motion Pictures theatrical motion picture operation after the release of only 6 theatrical films which was within weeks of CBS shutting down CBS Theatrical Films. The unit released one last movie, *SpaceCamp*, already produced in the summer of 1985. The unit would continue producing TV movies and mini-series while increasing TV series output. A Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation media analyst forecast ABC's losses on its theatrical operations for 1985 to be $5 million. After ABC shuttered down, the company elected to terminate its agreement with Mercury Entertainment in March 1986.

### ABC Pictures International

**ABC Pictures International, Inc.** (also ABC Picture Holdings, Inc.; API) was the theatrical production company owned and operated by ABC from 1965 to 1973 and produced or co produced 37 films. The company's films were distributed by Cinerama Releasing Corporation.

ABC Pictures was started as a division in 1965 and was incorporated as ABC Picture Holdings, Inc. on November 3, 1967 (1967-11-03). In 1968, it activated Palomar Pictures and Selmur Pictures to produce pictures for it. The entry of ABC into theatrical film production led to an FCC inquiry over the network's control of programming and a MPAA anti-trust lawsuit. David O. Selznick owned films were sold after his death in 1965 to API by his widow, Jennifer Jones.

The company's films (including those made by Selmur and Palomar) were not profitable and, with the recession of 1969–1971, ABC Pictures Corporation closed down its operations in early 1973. The 36 films cost $75 million to produce and generated rentals of $107 million, but with other costs such as distribution fees and interest, generated losses of $35 million. Only 6 of the films were profitable.

On October 20, 1977, ABC Picture Holdings, Inc. changed its name to ABC Pictures International, Inc. and was finally dissolved on February 19, 1988.

### American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures

**Atlas Pictures Corporation**, formerly **American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures Corporation** (also known as AB-PT Pictures and AB-PT) was the film production subsidiary of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres.

The company was formed due to a shorting of films produced, which was the reason for AB-PT not to sign a consent agreement in 1949 against the company's production of films. Films from AB-PT were first shown in Paramount Theater circuits prior to release to other chains. AB-PT Pictures used the Republic Pictures lot for productions. Republic was also their distributor, physically delivering to even AB-PT theaters plus sale to non-AB-PT theaters.

American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures Corporation was formed on December 30, 1956. Irving H. Levin was appointed President of the company. AB-PT Pictures initial production budget was $3 million for seven films. Films were to be B-films with an eye on quality but "meet the exhibitor's call for 'highly gimmicked and exploitable' product." In March 1957, AB-PT was talking with Republic and United Artists regarding distribution. The company's first film was *Beginning of the End*. With its first acquisition of *The Unearthly* in early May, AB-PT placed it into a double feature premiere with *End* released on June 19 at the B&K Roosevelt Theatre. On May 9, 1957, AB-PT Pictures executives met with the exhibition arm of the film industry where they announced their first slate of 7 films with announcement of a distributor in the next 10 days.

On June 6, 1957, AB-PT agreed to have Republic distribute their films. The company's first double bill films did well despite the films uneven quality. On September 24, 1957, AB-PT Pictures indicated that the company would move in the next year into A features with 5 of their 15 planned films to be of this type. For the A films, budgets would run from $.5 million to $1 million. However, AB-PT would only produce four films. AB-PT Pictures provided funding for The Bat (1959 film).

Levin along with Harry L. Mandell purchased AB-PT Pictures and AB-PT Distribution Corporation from AB-PT in May 1958. AB-PT Pictures was renamed Atlas Pictures Corporation.
