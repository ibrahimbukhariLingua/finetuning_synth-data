### History

This index has been calculated since 31 December 1986, originally as the FT-Actuaries World Indices.

In 1995, Wood Mackenzie and Co., one of the original partners, sold its stake to Standard & Poor’s. The name of the index was changed to FT/S&P – Actuaries World Indices.

On 29 November 1999, *FTSE International Limited* acquired the stakes of Goldman Sachs and Standard & Poor’s. The name changed to the FTSE World Index series.

FTSE took exclusive rights to integrate the Baring Emerging Markets data series with its existing FTSE World Index series. This resulted in the creation of the FTSE All-World Index series on 30 June, 2000.

On 22 September, 2003, FTSE introduced enhancements to improve the coverage of mid cap stocks in the index and remove some smaller stocks.
