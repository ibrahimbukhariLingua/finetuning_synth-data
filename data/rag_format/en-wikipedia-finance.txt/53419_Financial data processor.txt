Financial data processor


# Financial data processor



**Financial data processors** are the next layer in the service chain between users of financial data and financial data vendors. Most data is now delivered as bits and bytes and not in a physical format. Data is fed through web pages and as "raw" data files. Files are either processed by banks or by third-party companies â€“ financial data processors who provide additional added value to those companies who choose to use them.
