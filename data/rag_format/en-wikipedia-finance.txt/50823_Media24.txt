## Background


### Welkom Yizani

Welkom Yizani is a share scheme launched by Media24 in September 2006. This scheme owns 15 percent of Media24, a subsidiary of Naspers Ltd. Media24 received R1.4 billion after the unbundling of Novus Holdings in 2017. At the Media24/Welkom Yizani annual general meeting it was announced that shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of not less than R14.79 per Welkom Yizani ordinary share. In addition, the board declared an ordinary dividend of 42.5 cents per share.

Shareholders of Welkom Yizani accepted Media24â€™s cash offer to buy out all the shares at a special general meeting held on 22 January 2021. The transaction has been concluded, Welkom Yizani was delisted from the Equity Express Securities Exchange (EESE) and the scheme has been unwound.


## Criticism

16 March 2018 Media24 agreed to pay R14 million as a settlement agreement with the Competition Commission after admitting to price fixing and fixing of trade conditions in the media industry.
