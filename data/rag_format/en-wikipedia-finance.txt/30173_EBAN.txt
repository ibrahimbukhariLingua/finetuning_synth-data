**EBAN** (**European Business Angel Network**) is an international, not-for-profit trade association whose function is to represent the pan-European early stage investor community, gathering member organisations and individuals from Europe and beyond. Originally targeted only to business angels, it later became a cross sector representative of equity early stage investors.
