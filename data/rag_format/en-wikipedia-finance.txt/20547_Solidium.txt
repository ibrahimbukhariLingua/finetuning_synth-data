Solidium


# Solidium



**Solidium Oy** is a Finnish state-owned investment company. Founded in 1991, Solidium's original purpose was to manage the property of SKOP Bank (*Säästöpankkien Keskus-Osake-Pankki*; fi), which went bankrupt in the early 1990s recession.

In 2008, Solidium's mandate became the management of the listed minority shareholdings of the Finnish state.

Previously, the government directly owned the stock, and transferring it to a single company was the work of Minister of Trade and Industry Jyri Häkämies. On August 1, 2022, the net asset value of Solidium was EUR 8,968 billion.

Aside from Solidium, the government still directly owns shares in three listed companies as a majority shareholder.


## Holdings

Solidium took over the state-owned shares in 2008 of Kemira, Metso, Outokumpu, Rautaruukki, Sampo, Sponda, Stora Enso, and Telia, and in 2009 Elisa.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Solidium acquired over 5% of Outotec Mining Technology Company's shares in March 2012, while Goldman Sachs reduced its ownership to less than 5%. 5% is the limit of the obligatory stock information note in Finland.

Solidium has also bought Talvivaara mining stocks and sold all shares of Sponda.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
