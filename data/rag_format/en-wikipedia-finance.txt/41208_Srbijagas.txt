**Srbijagas** (full legal name: *J.P. Srbijagas Novi Sad*) is the state-owned natural gas provider in Serbia with headquarters in Novi Sad.


## History

Srbijagas was established on 1 October 2005 as a result of restructuring the integrated petroleum company NIS. The company was created on the basis of NIS divisions NIS-Gas and NIS-Energogas.

In 2013, the government of Serbia decided to split Srbijagas into two separate companies because of its mounting debt and unsustainable business practices. Since 2013, the transportation and storage units have been operated by Transgas AD, while trade and distribution have continued to be operated by the Srbijagas AD.
