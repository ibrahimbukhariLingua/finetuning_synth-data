### Writings

Chown wrote several books on tax policy, is the author of “A History of Monetary Unions” (Routledge 2003), and has contributed a chapter, “Lessons of Monetary History”, to the IEA study, “The Euro – the Beginning, the Middle .. and the End?” (April 2013) and reviewed for Central Banking, Harold James “Making the European Monetary Union” (February 2013).

Two articles and several other reviews in Central Banking deal more generally with the financial crisis. In November 2009, he wrote an article “Towards a New Banking System! In which he commented briefly on the problems arising from bad practices in the banking system. The editor invited him to follow up on this in “Conflicts of Interest and System Risk”, Central Banking, November 2010, discusses improper (and therefore unsustainable) profits made by banks, and their potential threat to financial stability, was a follow-up to an earlier article in November 2009, “Towards a New Banking System”. Several subsequent book reviews followed up on his point. He has contributed chapters to more than fifteen books on the topics of tax reform and monetary policy.

Chown, shocked by the way in which the banks were making very substantial hidden profits out of Initial Public Offerings by exploiting conflicts of interest, he made major campaigns and published “End to Underwriting: How the Coalition can avoid being Ripped Off!”, Centre for Policy Studies, August, 2011. When the EU proposed a Financial Transactions Tax (the Tobin Tax), Chown was invited to give evidence to the House of Lords Committee in late 2011 and followed this with a publication “Time To Bin The Tobin Tax” Centre for Policy Studies, April 2012.
