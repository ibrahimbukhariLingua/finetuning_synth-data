## History

The telethon continued as a major fundraising arm for the organization for many years, and some hospital markets still use it today.

Children's Miracle Network rebranded as Children's Miracle Network Hospitals in the U.S. in 2011. Currently, CMN Hospitals operates the largest network of children's hospitals in both the U.S. and Canada.

Most of the organization's funding, totaling $7 billion, has been raised one dollar at a time through the charity's iconic "Miracle Balloon" campaign.
