Weatherhead School of Management


# Weatherhead School of Management



The **Weatherhead School of Management** is a private business school of Case Western Reserve University located in Cleveland, Ohio. Weatherhead offers programs concentrated in sustainability, design innovation, healthcare, organizational behavior, global entrepreneurship, and executive education. The school is named for benefactor and Weatherchem owner Albert J. Weatherhead III, and its principal facility is the **Peter B. Lewis Building**.


## History

In 1952, *Western Reserve University* established the School of Business by combining the Cleveland College Division of Business Administration and the Graduate School Division of Business Administration. From its founding until 1988, the activities of the School of Business were divided among the number of buildings in downtown Cleveland and in University Circle. In 1967, the merger of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University created Case Western Reserve University, and the Western Reserve University School of Business absorbed Case’s Division of Organizational Sciences to become the School of Management in 1970. In 1976, the school launched its first full-time MBA.

In 1980, the School of Management was renamed in honor of Albert J. Weatherhead, III, a Cleveland businessman and industrialist, following his $3 million gift to the school. In 1988, space on the Case Quad within what is now known as Nord Hall, then Enterprise Hall, was specially converted to house the growing Business Management program. This was made possible by funding from five leading Cleveland companies: Ohio Mattress, Nesco, Premier Industries, Parker Hannifin, and Keithley Industries.

In 2002, the new Peter B. Lewis Building was completed to house the management school. It was designed by internationally known architect Frank Gehry. The School of Management has about 1600 students annually.


## Campus

The Weatherhead School of Management is housed in the Peter B. Lewis Building, located at the corner of Bellflower Road and Ford Drive. Designed by Frank Gehry and completed in 2002, the building has an area of approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m²) and stands five stories tall. It is named after Cleveland philanthropist Peter B. Lewis, who donated $36.9 million towards its construction. The building's decentralized design was chosen so that, “Faculty offices, classrooms and meeting areas are distributed on every floor to encourage informal interaction and complement the Weatherhead School’s learner-centered curricula.”


## The Center for Business as an Agent of World Benefit

The Center was launched on June 24, 2004.

Much of the Center’s effort in all three action domains – research, pedagogy, and outreach – were manifested in 2006 at the *Global Forum for Business as an Agent of World Benefit* convened by the Case Weatherhead School of Management, the Academy of Management, and the United Nations Global Compact. The Forum attracted more than 400 leading scholars and business leaders from 40 countries; another 600 participated virtually. The Center created new partners for the school, including Toyota, Coca-Cola, Novartis, Lafarge, Sherwin Williams, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, and others.

## People


### Faculty

Prominent faculty include David Cooperrider, Kalle Lyytinen, Fred Collopy, Dick Boland and Richard Buchanan. Boland and Collopy are widely published leaders in the emerging 'design thinking' trend. In addition to numerous articles, Collopy and Boland authored the book "Managing as Designing" about the experience of working with Frank Gehry and how this experience helped shape the design thinking trend. With the help of Richard Buchanan, The Weatherehad School of Management's lead role in the trend was recognized by BusinessWeek in September, 2009, as one of the top 30 Design Thinking programs in the world. Their 'Manage By Designing' initiative helped launch the *Weatherhead Collection* and the rest of the school's much-praised rebranding effort that is notable for having pioneered the use of high-design aesthetics instead of the traditionally conservative approach historically taken by business schools.

### May 2003 shooting and hostage crisis

On May 9, 2003, a gunman entered the school and went on a shooting spree, killing one student, Norman Wallace, and wounding a professor and a Ph.D. student. The suspect was later identified as 62-year-old Biswanath Halder, a 1999 alumnus and native of Calcutta, India. He held off police and SWAT officers for over seven hours, while approximately 100 people hid in offices and closets until they were rescued by police. Halder was ultimately apprehended by a SWAT team in a fifth floor classroom closet. He was convicted on multiple counts and sentenced to life in prison. An appeal in 2008 was denied.
