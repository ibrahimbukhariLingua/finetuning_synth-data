# Strathclyde Business School



The **Strathclyde Business School** (**SBS**) is one of four faculties forming the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Founded in 1973, but tracing its history back to the establishment of the Royal College of Science and Technology's Department of Industrial Administration in 1947, the school is located on Cathedral Street within the John Anderson campus of the university. It offers courses for business education and management development.

Strathclyde Business School has around 200 academic staff and more than 4500 students (1960 undergraduate and 2615 postgraduate). The faculty contains seven departments and six specialist centres. The school has international centres in Bahrain ,Greece, Malaysia, Oman, and UAE.


## History

Management education started at Glasgow's Royal College of Science and Technology in 1947 with the establishment of the Department of Industrial Administration. The Glasgow School of Management was established in 1950 as a joint venture between this department and the Glasgow and West of Scotland Commercial College (which became the Scottish College of Commerce in 1955).

In 1964, the College of Commerce and the Royal College merged to form the University of Strathclyde. There had been hope that the government would establish a business school at the new university but, following the Franks Report in 1963, government resources were concentrated on funding business schools in Manchester and London instead. From 1964, the university also had a School of Business and Administration. Despite the lack of a business school, Strathclyde was a flourishing centre of business education with 370 undergraduates, 86 postgraduates, over 400 part-time diploma students, and short post-experience courses being given to over 500 people a year at the Chesters residential centre. It established an MBA course in 1966 within the Department of Industrial Administration.

In 1970, the government was persuaded to fund a business school in Scotland but rather than being established at a single university the Scottish Business School was established as a partnership between the universities of Strathclyde, Glasgow and Edinburgh in 1971; it would eventually take in Stirling and Heriot-Watt before being transformed into the Confederation of Scottish Business Schools in 1987 and then the Association for Management Education and Training in Scotland in 1989. Also in 1971, Strathclyde's Department of Industrial Administration became part of the Department of Administration, and in 1973 the Strathclyde Business School was established. Business education continued to be split across multiple departments, with the business school offering post-experience postgraduate courses, the School of Business and Administration offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and other postgraduate management courses being offered by the Department of Production Management and Manufactory Technology. In 1982, a reorganisation of the university saw the School of Business and Administration closed and the business school elevated to a faculty containing multiple departments.
