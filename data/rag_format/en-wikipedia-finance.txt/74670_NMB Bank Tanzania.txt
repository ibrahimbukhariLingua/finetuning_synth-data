## History

Following the break-up of the old National Bank of Commerce in 1997, by act of Parliament, three new entities were created: (a) NBC Holdings Limited (b) National Bank of Tanzania (1997) and (c) National Microfinance Bank (NMB). Initially NMB could only offer savings accounts, with limited lending capabilities. In 2005, NMB Bank was privatized and the Government of Tanzania, the sole owner of NMB until then, divested 49 percent shareholding to Rabobank of the Netherlands. Over the years since that time, further divestiture by the Tanzanian Government and subsequent listing of the bank's stock has led to a diversified ownership structure, as outlined under "Ownership". In 2008, the Government of Tanzania off-loaded another 21 percent shareholding in an initial public offering (IPO) at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE).
