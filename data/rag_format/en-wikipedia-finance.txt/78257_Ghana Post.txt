## History

Historically, Ghana Post commenced business in 1854 as the Post and Telecommunications Department of the Colonial Administration. It was transformed into a corporation in 1974 with the promulgation of the NRC Decree 311 of 1974. The Telecommunications Division was carved out of the corporation in 1993, leaving the Postal Division to be renamed the Ghana Postal Services Corporation, its enabling act being Act 505 of 1995. The corporation was later incorporated under the Companies' Code (Act 179) in 1995 in line with the enactment of the Statutory Corporations (Conversion To Companies) Act 1993, Act 461; which required some state-owned enterprises to become limited liability companies; hence its current name Ghana Post Company Limited.

The company has legal monopoly over the provision of the universal postal service; letters below 100 grams.

The company provides postal, courier, retail, agency and financial services for its customers for profit.
