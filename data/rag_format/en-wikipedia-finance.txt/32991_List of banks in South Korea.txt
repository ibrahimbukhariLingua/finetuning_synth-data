Suhyup Bank and Nonghyup Bank are not owned by the Korean government, but their organizations (NFAC – which is a sole shareholder of Nonghyup Financial Group – and NFFC) are largely influenced by the Korean government.ᵃᶜᶜᵒʳᵈⁱⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ʷʰᵒᵐ?

In comparison to commercial banks, non-bank deposit-taking institutions have a narrower scope of business activities.

Payment and settlement services may be limited or non-existent, and their business focuses are constrained in accordance with each institution's unique characteristics.
