## Beverages

Aujan entered the beverages industry in 1928, when it secured the exclusive license to distribute Vimto in the Middle East. The company established its first beverage manufacturing plant in 1979 at Dammam, Saudi Arabia. The company introduced Rani Orange Float, its first homegrown beverage, in 1982. Aujan Industries began importing Barbican from U.K.-based Bass Beers for sale in the Middle East in 1983. Alongside the Swiss-made beverage Moussy, Barbican was the first non-alcoholic malt beverage to be sold in the region. Manufacturing changes at Bass Beers disrupted supplies of Barbican to Aujan, and in 1999, Aujan purchased the Barbican brand in select markets. Aujan acquired complete control of Barbican in 2010, and began manufacturing the beverage at the company's factory in Dubai. Aujan established a second beverage manufacturing plant in 2005 at Dubai, UAE.

On 14 December 2011, the Coca-Cola acquired a 50% stake in Aujan's beverages business for $980Â million. Coca-Cola acquired a 50% stake in Aujan's brands, and a 49% stake in its bottling and distribution company. Aujan retains control of the Vimto license, and also its manufacturing and distribution operations in Iran. The deal was completed on 24 September 2012.

Following the deal, the two companies established Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company (ACCBC) and Rani Refreshments in 2012. Rani Refreshments holds the global brand rights for Aujan's original brands such as Rani and Barbican. Both companies are headquartered in Dubai. ACCBC will serve as the manufacturer and distributor of the brands owned by Rani Refreshments and the Coca-Cola Company, as well as Vimto under license. Mirroring the system used by Coca-Cola and its global bottling partners, Rani Refreshments will supply ACCBC with proprietary concentrate and the latter will produce and distribute the beverages.

Coca-Cola and Aujan held a ceremony in Dubai in March 2013 to mark the one billionth can of Rani produced by ACCBC. In July 2014, ACCBC announced that it had completed a deal to acquire an 80% stake in the National Beverage Company, the manufacturer and distributor of Coca-Cola and Pampa products in Lebanon, for an undisclosed sum. As a result, the National Beverage Company's manufacturing plant in Beirut, Lebanon became Aujan's fourth beverage manufacturing plant.
