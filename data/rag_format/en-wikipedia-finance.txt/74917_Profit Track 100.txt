Profit Track 100


# Profit Track 100



The **Sunday Times Profit Track 100** is an annual league table published in association with The Sunday Times newspaper in the UK. It ranks Britain's 100 private companies with the fastest-growing profits over their last three years. It is published in The Sunday Times each April, with an awards event typically held in June, and alumni dinners during the year. The league table is researched and produced by Fast Track, an Oxford-based research and networking events business.


## About Fast Track

Fast Track is a leading research and events company that has built a network of the UK's top-performing private companies, from the fastest-growing to the biggest, through its rankings in The Sunday Times. Founded in 1997 by Hamish Stevenson, it now publishes seven annual league tables and brings company founders and directors together at invitation-only networking awards events and alumni dinners.

## Latest Profit Track 100 league table

The 21st annual Sunday Times Profit Track 100 league table supplement was due to be published on 5 April 2020. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Fast Track delayed publication in order to liaise with the featured companies. Out of the original 100 companies, 70 explicitly asked to feature, and 30 did not want to be included. In addition to the league table ranking, the supplement highlighted the positive actions that some companies took to support their staff, local communities, the NHS and key workers during the initial stages of the pandemic. The number one ranked company was fitness clothing retailer Gymshark, which grew its operating profits from £1.1m in 2016 to £18.6m in 2019.
