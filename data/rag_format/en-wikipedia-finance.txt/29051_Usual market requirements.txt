Usual market requirements


# Usual market requirements



The **usual market requirements** (UMR) of a country are a measure of its import requirement met through commercial purchases. It is usually defined as a five-year average.


## Agricultural policy

The UMR is used to determine whether concessional sales (e.g., under Title I of P.L. 480) will adversely affect normal commercial agricultural trade.
