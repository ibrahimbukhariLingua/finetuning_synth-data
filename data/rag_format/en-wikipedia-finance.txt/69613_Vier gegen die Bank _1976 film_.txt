# Vier gegen die Bank (1976 film)



***Vier gegen die Bank*** is a 1976 German crime comedy television film directed by Wolfgang Petersen. It was adapted from the novel *The Nixon Recession Caper* by Ralph Maloney and was produced for the German television station ARD. In 2016 it was remade under the same title for theatrical release.


## Plot

Hartmut Wredel, a respected lawyer, is left unemployed by the recession. At his golf club he discovers that three other members have not paid their membership dues for a while. The men, out-of-work actor Peter Pagodi, fashion designer Benedict Hoffmann, and garage owner Gustav Blümel, have also been hit hard by the recession. Wredel convinces them that a bank robbery is the solution to their problems. They successfully carry out the plan and even escape imprisonment because the police blame the robbery on a separate group of terrorists who were planning to rob the same bank.
