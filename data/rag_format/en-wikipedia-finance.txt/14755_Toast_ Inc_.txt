## History

Toast's founders—Steve Fredette, Aman Narang, and Jonathan Grimm—initially created a consumer app centered for mobile payments, customer loyalty, promotions, and social aspects that integrated with restaurants’ existing POS systems.

In February 2020, Toast received $400 million in a round of Series F funding including Bessemer Venture Partners and TPG, at a valuation of $4.9 billion. As of June 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Toast is used in approximately 120,000 US restaurants.

In April 2020, Toast laid off 50% of its workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact on the restaurant industry.

In November 2020, Toast has a secondary sale that valued the company at around $8 billion, despite laying off half of its employees in April. On September 22, 2021, Toast went public with an initial public offering under the stock symbol TOST. The company offered shares at $40 initially, with a market capitalization of roughly $20 billion, making it one of 2021's largest American IPOs.

In February 2023, it was announced Toast had acquired the Costa Mesa-headquartered producer of digital display solutions and drive-thru technology for quick-service restaurants (QSRs), Delphi Display Systems.

Toast headquarters were located at Landmark Center from 2015 until June 2023.
