The company disposed of its struggling subsidiary dealing in quantitative equities, Intech, in spring 2022.

In January 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority initiated criminal proceedings against five people including a former analyst at the company for conspiracy to commit insider dealing and money laundering, and, in March 2023, the company was fined €1.7 million by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets for failure to provide notification of its shareholding of 3.02% in Renewi on a timely basis.

The company entered into a joint venture with Privacore Capital, to provide alternative assets for private wealth clients, in June 2023.

In May 2024, the company acquired Tabula Investment Management which specialises in European exchange-traded funds.
