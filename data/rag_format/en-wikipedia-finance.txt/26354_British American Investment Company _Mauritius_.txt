## Seizure by Republic of Mauritius

On April 3, 2015, BAIC's banking subsidiary, Bramer Banking Corporation, banking license was revoked by the Bank of Mauritius following an alleged US$693 million Ponzi scheme being run at the bank.

This alleged ponzi scandal also affected BAIC's insurance subsidiary, BAI Co. The firm's stock were suspended from trading on the same day and PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed as the receiver manager then the law was changed and back dated to legalize the appointment of PWC. There has been evidence of Ponzi scheme and opinions in the country remain severely divided on whether the company was the victim of a political conspiracy or if the scandal was in fact a genuine Ponzi scheme. The question is that if Dawood Rawat is a role model or a master of swindling?
On April 21, 2014 an international arrest warrant was issued for some of the BAIC directors wanted for fraud, money-laundering and embezzlement. The Mauritian Cabinet has since been drawing up plans to seize BAIC's assets and investments.
