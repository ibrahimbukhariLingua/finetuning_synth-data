## Company

Founded in 1991 as Blue Ocean Software, the company was acquired by Intuit in September 2002. The company continued to operate autonomously but as a wholly owned subsidiary under the Intuit umbrella, known as Intuit IT Solutions.

In December 2005, the company was renamed "Numara Software" when TA Associates purchased it from Intuit. The genesis of the new company name comes from the combination of the word "Nu," an English phonetic equivalent of "new" and "Mara" which in many languages means "Ocean." TA Associates has offices in Boston, Menlo Park and London and manages over $6 billion in capital.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On January 30, 2012, Numara Software entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by BMC Software.
