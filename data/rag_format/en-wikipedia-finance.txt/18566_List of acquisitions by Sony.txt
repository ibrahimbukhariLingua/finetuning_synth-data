# List of acquisitions by Sony



**Sony Group Corporation**, commonly referred to as Sony (Japanese: ソニー・グループ株式会社, *Sonī Gurūpu Kabushiki Kaisha*) is a multinational conglomerate corporation headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and one of the world's largest media conglomerates. The company's history of acquisitions reflects its strategic efforts to expand and diversify its business across various sectors such as entertainment, technology, and digital media. As a result, Sony has successfully broadened its presence across multiple industries, solidifying its position as a leader.

In 1988, Sony acquired CBS Records Group, marking its first major step into the music industry. The company entered the film and television sectors with the acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment in 1989. The acquisition of Psygnosis in 1993 played a key role in bolstering the launch of Sony's PlayStation console in 1994, which became a global success and marked the company's shift to digital entertainment.

Established in 2001, Sony Ericsson was a joint venture between Sony Corporation and Ericsson, and in 2012, it acquired Ericsson's 50% stake in the joint venture, making Sony the sole owner of the mobile phone business. Formed in 2004 as a joint venture between Sony Music Group and Bertelsmann Music Group, Sony BMG became fully part of Sony in 2008 when it acquired Bertelsmann's stake.

In 2012, Sony Interactive Entertainment acquired Gaikai to enhance its PlayStation Network offerings and expand its gaming portfolio into the realm of cloud gaming. That same year, Sony Music Group acquired a 30% stake in EMI Music Publishing and purchased the remaining 70% stake in 2018. Toshiba's image sensor business was acquired by Sony Semiconductor Solutions in 2015.

Crunchyroll, a leading anime streaming service and licensing company, was acquired in 2020 by Aniplex and Sony Pictures Entertainment. During the same year, Sony acquired the remaining shares of Sony Financial Group that it did not already own. Sony Interactive Entertainment's acquisition of Bungie in 2022 was a crucial step in expanding its gaming portfolio and strengthening its position in the highly competitive gaming industry.

Sony is known for acquiring over 100 companies, taking stakes in more than 50 others, and making over 20 divestments, although the actual total may be higher, as the company generally does not disclose most of its transactions unless revealed by the press. Furthermore, Sony has not disclosed the financial details of most of its acquisitions, stakes, and divestments.
