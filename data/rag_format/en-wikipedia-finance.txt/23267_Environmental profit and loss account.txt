Environmental profit and loss account


# Environmental profit and loss account



An **environmental profit and loss account** (**E P&L**) is a company's monetary valuation and analysis of its environmental impacts including its business operations and its supply chain from cradle-to-gate.
An E P&L internalizes externalities and monetizes the cost of business to nature by accounting for the ecosystem services a business depends on to operate in addition to the cost of direct and indirect negative impacts on the environment. The primary purpose of an E P&L is to allow managers and stakeholders to see the magnitude of these impacts and where in the supply chain they occur.

The E P&L analysis provides a metric to measure and monitor the footprint of the company's operations and suppliers all the way to the initial raw materials. It is a tool to build awareness of the importance of nature to the sustainability of businesses; enhance visibility across a company's supply chain and deepen understanding to focus sustainability efforts and implement better-informed operational decisions; improve specificity for risk management regarding environmental dependencies and impacts; and support a more holistic view of a company's performance, while bringing clarity and transparency to stakeholders at all levels and identifying new opportunities to enhance the sustainability of a company's products.


## Background

Conceived by Puma Chairman, Jochen Zeitz, and launched by Puma and its parent company's sustainability initiative (PPR HOME), the first-ever E P&L was conducted on 2010 data and released in two phases. In May 2011 the valuation of Puma's 2010 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) and water usage was announced, followed in November 2011, by Puma's overall E P&L, which also included valuation results for other forms of air pollution, land conversion and waste.

Simultaneously, the PPR Group announced in November 2011 that a Group E P&L would be implemented across its Luxury and Sport & Lifestyle brands by 2015.
