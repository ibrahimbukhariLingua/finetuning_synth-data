# Fundbox



**Fundbox** is a working capital platform based in San Francisco that offers credit and payments as a service to small businesses. Founded in 2013, the company innovates technology to help optimize cash flow for small businesses.


## History

The concept for Fundbox was partially inspired by co-founder Eyal Shinar's mother, who struggled with late payments at the employment agency she owned and operated in Israel. Founded by Yuval Ariav, Eyal Shinar, and Tomer Michaeli in 2013, it operated for a year in stealth mode before becoming available to the public in 2014. After launch, it announced it had received $17.5 million in funding from investors led by Khosla Ventures. In 2020, Fundbox hired Marten Abrahamsen, a former investment banker, as the company's chief financial officer.

As of November 2021, the company has received a total of $410 million in funding and a valuation of $1.1 billion, including $100 million in funding led by Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.
