BCCI Corporate Trophy


# BCCI Corporate Trophy



The **BCCI Corporate Trophy** was an Indian cricket competition. It was established in 2009 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as a 12-team inter-corporate tournament beginning at the start of the Indian cricket season before the start of the Ranji Trophy competition. This tournament was a 50-over a side tournament involving corporate teams. All the top Indian cricketers were expected to play along with academy cricket players and those who play regular domestic cricket in India.


## History

The corporate trophy acted as a high-profile starter to the Indian domestic cricket season. The BCCI's prime objective was to promote employment opportunities for domestic cricketers in India's corporate houses. The board invited 12 corporate teams to take part which involved some of India's top cricketers.

The winners collected ₹ 10 million (US$204,272) while the runners-up received ₹ 5 million (US$102,109) however, unlike the Indian Premier League (IPL) no foreign players took part.

The tournament initially involved players formerly from the now-defunct Indian Cricket League (ICL). Some of the ICL players said that after the announcement of the Corporate Trophy, they had received calls from their employers asking them to cut ties with the rebel league.

The inaugural tournament was won by Air India Red after they beat Air India Blue by 93 runs in the final.

The last edition of the competition was in 2014, the BCCI cited the difficulty of scheduling it in a full cricket calendar as the reason future editions did not take place.
