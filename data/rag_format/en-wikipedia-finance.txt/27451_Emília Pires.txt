## Early life

In 1975, as a teenager, Emilia Pires left East Timor (then Portuguese Timor) for Australia as a refugee, with her parents, brothers and sisters. At the time, she and her family believed they would be able to return after only a few days. However, exile lasted for 24 years before Pires was able to return to East Timor.

Pires began her professional career as a junior public servant in the Victorian Government in her early 20s. She then rose to senior management level.

Before becoming Minister of Finance, Ms. Pires held senior positions with:

* World Bank, Senior Aid Management Specialist in West Bank and Gaza, where she advised both the Ministries of Finance and Planning of the Palestinian Authority and donors on aid coordination to the economic sector
* United Nations, UNMISET’s Senior Advisor to the East Timor Ministry of Planning and Finance
* UNTAET’s Head of the Planning Commission Secretariat as well as the Chief of the National Development and Planning Agency (NPDA), and
* Chief of the National Development and Planning Agency (NPDA).

## Minister of Finance

Some of Pires' main achievements are:

* Timor-Leste Transparency Portal was launched in early 2011, enabling the public to search, evaluate and analyse State expenditures in real time. The reforms helped lead to the reduction by 19 countries of the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index
* Emilia Pires was selected to be the first Chair of the g7+, the first forum of its kind giving fragile and conflict-affected countries a voice and place to share issues and ideas. Pires held the role until May 2014, when Minister Kaifala Marah of Sierra Leone took over.
* Until June 2014, Pires co-chaired the International Dialogue of Peacebuilding and Statebuilding with Denmark and later with Finland, and

* To improve service delivery, Pires corporatised the Ministry of Finance increasing decentralisation of some functions to line Ministries, like parts of the procurement process.

Emilia Pires led the planning process for the first Timorese National Development Plan and East Timor’s Vision 2020, as well as chairing the UNDP Working Group to produce the first East Timor National Human Development Report.
