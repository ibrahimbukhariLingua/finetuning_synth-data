## Career

Later, President Jakaya Kikwete appointed him as Minister in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. His tenure at the finance ministry coincided with the "Tegeta Escrow Scandal", which involved the embezzlement of hundreds of million of dollars by high-ranking government officials. Dr Nchemba, who was not implicated, rightly maintained that the full extent of the law should apply to those involved.

He was appointed the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries in December 2015, by the then incoming president John Pombe Magufuli. Following the death of Ambassador Dr Agustine Phillip Mahiga, he was appointed the Minister of Constitutional and Legal Affairs.
