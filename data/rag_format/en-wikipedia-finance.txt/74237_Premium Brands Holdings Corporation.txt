# Premium Brands Holdings Corporation



**Premium Brands Holdings Corporation** is a Canadian specialty food manufacturing and distribution company. It is a publicly traded corporation on the Toronto Stock Exchange.


## History

Premium Brands was founded in 1917 as **Fletcher Limited**. It was renamed **Fletcher Fine Foods** in 1984. In 2000, the company re-branded to Premium Brands. The company sold its Fletcher's business in 2004. In 2005, it converted to an income trust, but it converted back to a normal corporation in 2009, through a complex deal with Thallion Pharmaceuticals. In its time as an income trust, the company had doubled revenues to $450 million. In 2010, Premium Brands acquired SK Food Group, a Seattle-based supplier of breakfast sandwiches and wraps to Starbucks, for $42.5 million. Partly as a result of increased sales of these products, Premium Brands' overall sales more than doubled in the 5 years from 2010 to 2015, to $1.2 billion. The company's sandwich sales increased from $156.8 million to $460 million in 2016. In 2016, the company purchased meat company C&C Packing for up to $146 million.

In April 2018, Premium Brands acquired Oberto Sausage Company.

On November 9, 2020, Premium Brands acquired Clearwater Seafoods for $1 billion in partnership with a group of Miꞌkmaq First Nations. The purchase represented the "largest investment in the seafood industry by a Canadian Indigenous group".
