The Firm (Malaysian TV series)


# The Firm (Malaysian TV series)



***The Firm*** is Malaysia's first corporate reality television programme produced by Popiah Pictures and ntv7. Hosted by Peter Pek and Chan Boon Yong, the show is directed by award-winning director Ng Ping Ho of *Kopitiam* fame. In *The Firm*, a group of professionals compete in an elimination-style competition to find the next corporate high-flyer.

The show attempts to separate the weak from the strong, the under-achievers from the over-achievers and the followers from the leaders. Each week, candidates compete in a series of tasks dealing with different disciplines in business that is imperative to the success of a corporate high-flier. Amongst others, these include branding, promotions, positioning and catering to target markets. The catch phrase used in the show is "You're terminated". The show premièred prime time on ntv7 and Astro channel 7 on 24 June 2007.

Although the show initially drew comparisons to Mark Burnett's *The Apprentice*, it became quite apparent that it is quite different in that there are two corporate leaders who lead each team and decide who gets eliminated when their team fails to win a challenge. In addition, in episode 7, both corporate leaders leave their jobs as mentors to the teams and a new CEO enters the picture.

*The Firm* has reached its second season, which premièred on ntv7 and Astro 107 on 2 August 2008.


## Hosts/Judges

The Firm has two corporate leaders, and a CEO, who all judge the candidates at different stages:

* **Peter Pek**: renowned brand guru, writer, columnist, editor, publisher, designer, creative director, public speaker, and head of Malaysia's largest branding agency, **Mercatus+**.
* **Chan Boon Yong**: entrepreneur and founder of **The Carat Club**, a diamond retailer.
