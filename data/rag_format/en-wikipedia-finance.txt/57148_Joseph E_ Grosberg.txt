**Joseph E. Grosberg** (December 27, 1883 – July 25, 1970) was an American businessman in the supermarket and wholesale foods industries.

## Biography


### Early life

Grosberg was born in 1883 in Russia. His father, Jacob Grosberg, immigrated to the United States through (Germany) to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army and in doing so, changed his surname from Gans to the more-German-sounding Grosberg. After Jacob established himself in the US, he sent a cabin class ticket for his wife (and presumably his oldest child, Joseph) to join him, but as was common those days when women traveled without a male accompanying them, Anna was put into the lower-class steerage section on the ship and her cabin class accommodations given to someone else. Jacob Grosberg later hired an attorney to write a letter to the shipping company complaining about the injustice, and the cost of his wife's passage was eventually reimbursed to him.

The oldest of eight children, Joseph sold newspapers on a street corner as a young boy to help support his family. Grosberg started in the grocery business in 1903 when he and his father, Jacob Grosberg, opened a retail grocery store, J. Grosberg & Son. A year later, the younger Grosberg entered the wholesale business, bringing wholesale groceries to the Schenectady, New York, area.


### Central Markets

In 1930, Joseph Grosberg merged his wholesale business with that of Lewis Golub. In addition, he maintained the Grosberg Grocery Company of Amsterdam and headed Municipal Grocery Stores, Inc., a cooperative organization of independent grocers operating more than 400 stores throughout the New York state.

The Grosberg-Golub wholesale grocers opened their first supermarket in 1932 in Green Island, New York. It was one of the first self-service supermarkets in the country and its emphasis on low prices was very successful in the Depression-era economy. The following year Grosberg-Golub opened a second store: the first supermarket in Schenectady. With the opening of their third store, they changed the name to Central Market. Eventually the chain of Central Markets stores in New York included three large supermarkets in Schenectady, two in Troy, and one each in Glens Falls, Saratoga Springs, Albany, Mechanicville, Green Island, and Watervliet. In addition, the concern operated the DeForest Department Store in Cohoes, New York, and the Clark Department Store in Ballston Spa, New York. The policy of his supermarkets according to Grosberg was to provide food to the public at the lowest possible cost. This was accomplished through low overhead in the operation of the big supermarket and the company's tremendous buying power.

In addition to heading the Grosberg-Golub corporation, Grosberg was an officer in several national super market organizations including the New York Wholesale Grocers Association, president of the Seaboard Food Corporation, a national wholesale buying organization, and national secretary of the Super Market Institute.

Grosberg retired from the grocery business in 1943. Bernard and William Golub, the sons of his original partner Lewis Golub and partners in the Grosberg-Golub Corporation, bought Grosberg's share of the company and formed the Golub Corporation. In 1973, the Golubs changed the name of Central Markets to Price Chopper.


### Philanthropy and civic activities

Grosberg was active in numerous civic affairs in the Schenectady area. He was one of the founders of Schenectady's first Zionist organization in 1903. He was a charter member and served as president of the Schenectady Kiwanis club. He was a 32nd degree Mason, a member of the Elks Club, and was involved in the Schenectady Community Chest, an organization first established in 1923 to coordinate the work and funding of charity and social-service organizations.

Grosberg was also active in Jewish affairs and an advocate for Israel. He was one of the founders of the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) in Schenectady in 1916, which went on to become the Schenectady Jewish Community Center (JCC). He devoted over 47 years of service to the YMHA and JCC, serving as president from 1916 to 1930 and also serving as chairman of the board of Trustees. He eventually donated the Joseph E. Grosberg Building to the Schenectady Jewish Community Center for their use. He was chairman of the United Jewish Appeal (aka Jewish National Appeal) which were held shortly before the outbreak of WWII in Europe to aid Jews who were being oppressed and driven from their homes by Hitler. He was the regional chairman of the United Synagogues of America, President of the United Hebrew Committee, and President of the Agudat Achim (then referred to as Nott Terrace) Synagogue in Schenectady. He also served as honorary vice president of the Troy Jewish Home for the Aged and for over 50 years installed officers of the local Jewish Social Service Organization. In 1943, Henry Montor, director of the United Palestine Appeal praised Grosberg's services in connection to raising funds for the rehabilitation of Palestine.
