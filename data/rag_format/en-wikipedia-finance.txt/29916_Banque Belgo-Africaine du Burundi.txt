## History

In the 1960s there three commercial banks in Burundi, linked to Belgian banking groups, *Banque de Credit de Bujumbura* (BJB), *Banque Commerciale du Burundi* (BANCOBU) and BBAB.
These banks gave credit to traders and farmers.
They were most active during the coffee and cotton harvests between June and September.
In the coffee business they avoided the risks of financing during cultivation, when defaults were common, but provided bridgng finance during the period of about three months between sale of coffee and receipt of payments from foreign buyers.

As of 30 September 1976 the BBAB had fixed assets of 0.4 billion BIF almost all in short-term investments.
It had no branches in Burundi.
It had 500 shares, or 3.1%, of the *Banque Nationale de Developpement Economique* (BNDE).
The financial network of Burundi consisted of the *Banque de la Republique du Burundi* (the central bank), the three almost entirely foreign-owned commercial banks, as well as the Development Bank (BNDE), the Public Savings Bank (*Caisse d'épargne du Burundi*), the postal cheque system and the Social Security Fund.

In 1988 the BBAB was absorbed into BANCOBU.
