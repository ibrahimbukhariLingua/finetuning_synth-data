Candlestick pattern


# Candlestick pattern



In financial technical analysis, a **candlestick pattern** is a movement in prices shown graphically on a candlestick chart that some believe can help to identify repeating patterns of a particular market movement. The recognition of the pattern is subjective and programs that are used for charting have to rely on predefined rules to match the pattern. There are 42 recognized patterns that can be split into simple and complex patterns.


## History

Some of the earliest technical trading analysis was used to track prices of rice in the 18th century. Much of the credit for candlestick charting goes to Munehisa Homma (1724–1803), a rice merchant from Sakata, Japan who traded in the Dojima Rice market in Osaka during the Tokugawa Shogunate. According to Steve Nison, however, candlestick charting came later, probably beginning after 1850.

The most famous candlestick trader is the man who invented them, Munehisa Homma. He was a Japanese rice trader who tracked price action and saw patterns developing. He published his work in The Fountain of Gold — The Three Monkey Record of Money in 1755. In today’s dollars, he made about $10 billion.


## Formation of candlestick

A **candlestick chart** (also called **Japanese candlestick chart** or **K-line**) is a style of financial chart used to describe price movements of a security, derivative, or currency. Stock price prediction based on K-line patterns is the essence of candlestick technical analysis. However, there are some disputes on whether the K-line patterns have predictive power in academia.

Candlesticks are graphical representations of price movements for a given period of time.

They are commonly formed by the opening, high, low, and closing prices of a financial instrument.

If the opening price is above the closing price then a filled (normally red or black) candlestick is drawn.

If the closing price is above the opening price, then normally a green or hollow candlestick (white with black outline) is shown.

The filled or hollow portion of the candle is known as the body or *real body*, and can be long, normal, or short depending on its proportion to the lines above or below it.

The lines above and below, known as *shadows*, *tails*, or *wicks*, represent the high and low price ranges within a specified time period.

However, not all candlesticks have shadows.


## Simple patterns

| |
| --- |
| **Big Black Candle** Has an unusually long black body with a wide range between high and low. Prices open near the high and close near the low. Considered a bearish pattern. | **Big White Candle** Has an unusually long white body with a wide range between high and low of the day. Prices open near the low and close near the high. Considered a doji pattern. |
| |
| **Black Body** Formed when the opening price is higher than the closing price. Considered to be a bearish signal. | **White Body** Formed when the closing price is higher than the opening price and considered a bullish signal. |
|
| **Doji** Formed when opening and closing prices are virtually the same. The lengths of shadows can vary. If previous are bearish, after a Doji, may be ready to bullish. | **Long-Legged Doji** Consists of a Doji with very long upper and lower shadows. Indicates strong forces balanced in opposition. If previous are bullish, after long legged doji, may be ready to bearish. |
|
| **Dragonfly Doji** Formed when the opening and the closing prices are at the highest of the day. If it has a longer lower shadow it signals a more bullish trend. When appearing at market bottoms it is considered to be a reversal signal. | **Gravestone Doji** Formed when the opening and closing prices are at the lowest of the day. If it has a longer upper shadow it signals a bearish trend. When it appears at market top it is considered a reversal signal. |
|
| **Hammer** A black or white candlestick that consists of a small body near the high with little or no upper shadow and a long lower tail. Considered a bullish pattern during a downtrend. A hammer shows that although there were selling pressures during the day, ultimately a strong buying pressure drove the price back up. The colour of the body can vary, but green hammers indicate a stronger bull market than red hammers. | **Hanging Man** A black or white candlestick that consists of a small body near the high with little or no upper shadow and a long lower tail. The lower tail should be two or three times the height of the body. Considered a bearish pattern during an uptrend. |
|
| **Inverted Hammer** A black or white candlestick in an upside-down hammer position. Considered a bearish pattern in an uptrend. In a downtrend, it indicates a buying pressure, followed by a selling pressure that was not strong enough to drive the market price down. The inverse hammer suggests that buyers will soon have control of the market. | **Shooting Star** A black or white candlestick that has a small body, a long upper shadow and little or no lower tail. Considered a bearish pattern in an uptrend. |
|
| **Long Upper Shadow** A black or white candlestick with an upper shadow that has a length of 2/3 or more of the total range of the candlestick. Normally considered a bearish signal when it appears around price resistance levels. | **Long Lower Shadow** A black or white candlestick is formed with a lower tail that has a length of 2/3 or more of the total range of the candlestick. Normally considered a bullish signal when it appears around price support levels. |
|
| **Marubozu** (jp: まるぼうず, 丸坊主, *close-cropped head, bald hill*) A long or normal candlestick (black or white) with no shadow or tail. The high and the low represent the opening and the closing prices. Considered a continuation pattern. | **Spinning Top** A black or white candlestick with a small body. The size of shadows can vary. Interpreted as a neutral pattern but gains importance when it is part of other formations. |
|
| **Shaven Head** A black or white candlestick with no upper shadow. [Compared with *hammer*.] | **Shaven Bottom** A black or white candlestick with no lower tail. [Compare with *Inverted Hammer*.] |

| **Darth Maul** The correct term for this candle is a "high wave spinning top", a small candle body with unusually large upper and lower shadows, suggesting that the prior trend has run into a period of indecision. The term "Darth Maul" comes from *Star Wars*, as the candle looks somewhat like a lightsaber. | **Judas Candle** Consists of a large black candle followed by a smaller white candle with a lower tail which is equal to the black candle in length.

| |
| **Island reversal** In both stock trading and financial technical analysis, an **island reversal** is a candlestick pattern with compact trading activity within a range of prices, separated from the move preceding it. A "candlestick pattern" is a movement in prices shown graphically on a candlestick chart. This separation shown on the chart, is said to be caused by an exhaustion gap and the subsequent move in the opposite direction occurs as a result of a breakaway gap. | | |
