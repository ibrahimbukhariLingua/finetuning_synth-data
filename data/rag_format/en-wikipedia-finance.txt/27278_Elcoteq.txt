Elcoteq


# Elcoteq



**Elcoteq SE** was a Finnish consumer electronics contract manufacturer, EMS, and ODM company headquartered in Luxembourg. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in Luxembourg on October 6, 2011.

It was a manufacturer of the BlackBerry and also performed repair and refurbishment services.


## History

Founded in 1984 as a microelectronics unit of the Lohja Corporation, the company became independent in an early 1990s management buyout.

Elcoteq made an IPO on the Helsinki Stock Exchange in November 1997.

It manufactured the ill-fated Microsoft Kin for Sharp Corporation in the late 2000s.

On October 6, 2011, Elcoteq filed for bankruptcy in Luxembourg. The loss of a major client, Nokia, to Asian sourcing outfits may have been a contributing cause.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
