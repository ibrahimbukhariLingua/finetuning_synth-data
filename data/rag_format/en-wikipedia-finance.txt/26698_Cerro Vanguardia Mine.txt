Cerro Vanguardia Mine


# Cerro Vanguardia Mine



The **Cerro Vanguardia Mine** is a gold and silver mine located 150 km north west of Puerto San Julián, in the Santa Cruz province of Argentina.


## History

The gold deposit at Cerro Vanguardia was first discovered in 1976 and, in 1987, mining group Pérez Companc S.A. formed a mineral exploration joint venture with *AMSA*, Anglo American’s South American holding company.

AngloGold, predecessor of AngloGold Ashanti, acquired a 46.23% interest in the project in 1998–99, and an additional 46.25%, the Pérez Companc stake, in July 2002, doubling its interest to 92.5%. AngloGold Ashanti owns the right to exploit the
deposit for 40 years based on the *Usufruct Agreement*, signed in
December 1996. Cerro Vanguardia, which was constructed at a total cost of US$ 270 million, was commissioned in late 1998.

The mine suffered a difficult year in 2008, when production fell by 25% while the cash cost more than doubled. The company did however manage to improve production in 2009 and lower the cash cost again. In 2009, the mine was also fatality-free for the seventh consecutive year.

Plans at Cerro Vanguardia included an underground operation, from 2010, and a heap leach operation.

As of 2004ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ it was majority-owned and operated by AngloGold Ashanti, which held a 92.5% interest in the mine. The remaining 7.5% was owned by *Formicruz* (*Fomento Minero de Santa Cruz Sociedad del Estado*), a company owned by the province of Santa Cruz.

In 2008, the mine contributed 3% to the company's annual production and employed in excess of 1,000 people. The Cerro Vanguardia mine consists of a number of small open pits.
