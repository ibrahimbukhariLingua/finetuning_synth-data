## History

The history of Aluminij began in the first years of the 20th century, with the discovery of bauxite ore deposits in Herzegovina and the subsequent exploitation of the resource. After the end of World War II in 1945, a new company was created, Bauxite Mines Mostar, with the goal of exploring, exploiting and transporting bauxite commercially. It was this first company that carried out the initial construction studies for aluminium smelters were conducted, the birth of the aluminium industry that was to come. In 1969, the bauxite Mines Mostar Company merged with Energoinvest Sarajevo to form a new organisation focused on aluminium production.

The Government of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina tasked the group with maximizing the potential of the resources in the region and develops a new facility that could turn Mostar into a global aluminium producer. This was achieved by 1975, as regular aluminium production began in the new Alumina Factory. This successful development was based on cooperation between Energoinvest and the French company Pechiney. Aluminij was established in 1975 in Mostar. It soon emerged as one of the largest aluminium manufacturing companies in former Yugoslavia.

The company's facilities were largely destroyed during the 1992–1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and were later rebuilt.

By the end of June 2002, an extensive modernization project for Aluminij Factory had been completed. At a cost of 250 million Euros it brought new technologies and introduced production upgrades that increased output, efficiency and quality, this allowed Aluminij Factory to remain competitive on the world stage, matching the global leading producers for quality.

In 2007, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed to privatise Aluminij. Among the companies who placed a bid were; Alcoa, Alcan Inc., Rusal, Norsk Hydro and Swiss-based metals trader Glencore International. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina blocked the selloff and decided to annul the tender.

As of 2007ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the company was owned 44% by the government, 44% by workers and former workers and 12% by the Croatian Privatization Fund. The government's and workers' shares are to be sold to international investors.
