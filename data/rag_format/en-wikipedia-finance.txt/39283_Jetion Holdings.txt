## History

Jetion listed on the Alternative Investment Market in 2007. The "Deloitte Technology Fast 500 Asia-Pacific", which identifies the most rapidly expanding businesses in the Asia–Pacific, listed Jetion as number two in 2008. Robert Linsday of *The Times* in 2008 attributed Jetion's stock market "slump" to "a perception that it has not communicated well enough with the market". Spain is a significant market for the company.

In 2009, Jetion fired its CEO and three members of its leadership team, citing "breaches of their service contracts and fiduciary duties". Comparing Jetion to Bodisen Biotech, the Nomura Securities analyst John-Marc Bunce stated that this action was "likely to have a sentimental knock-on effect on other foreign-listed Chinese companies".


## Finance

For the six months ended 30 June 2008, Jetion Holdings Limited's revenues totaled $100.7M, up from $38.6M. Net income totaled $9.7M, up from $2.8M. Revenues reflect an increase in income from cells and modules segment. Net income reflects the presence of other income, lower research & development expenses, increased finance income and the presence of share of profits less losses of joint controlled entity.
