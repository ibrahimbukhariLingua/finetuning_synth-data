## History

Founder Ryan Bell released the company’s first social media management software in 2008, a Twitter scheduling and management client called Twaitter. The success of Twaitter led Bell to design a multiple network management tool, initially called Gremln. The company spun out of Twaitter after local entrepreneur Hal Gentry raised financing for the company. Other capital came from Capital Innovators, Missouri Technology Corp, a public-private partnership, and private angel investors. In April 2014, Gremln was chosen to participate in the St. Louis-based financial services business accelerator, SixThirty.

In January 2014, the New York Bankers Association endorsed Gremln as the recommended social media management and compliance toolkit for all NYBA-member financial institutions. In November 2014, the company secured additional investment from St. Louis-based Cultivation Capital. Other investors include Capital Innovators, Missouri Technology Corp, a public-private partnership, and private angel investors. In May 2014, Gremln presented at the Finovate technology conference, and made a second appearance at Finovate Fall in September 2014.

Chris Moloney, a former executive with Wells Fargo Advisors, joined Gremln as CEO in September 2015. Founder Ryan Bell remained on as chairman and Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer. One month after Moloney joined the team, Gremlin Social was endorsed by the American Bankers Association – through its subsidiary the Corporation for American Banking, for social media marketing, monitoring, and compliance.

In August 2016, Hal Gentry a software entrepreneur and investor and board member at Gremln, replaced Moloney as Interim CEO in August 2016. The company rebranded as Gremlin Social in September 2016.

In September 2018 Gremlin Social expanded its product offering through the acquisition of VidVerify and Insight CRM.
