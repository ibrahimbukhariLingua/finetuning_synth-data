## EFFAS Commission

*1. EFFAS Commission on ESG (CESG):* For years, EFFAS has had a strong position in developing standards for the reporting of extra-financials. With its Commission on Intellectual Capital (CIC) and its Commission on ESG (CESG) EFFAS not only has been instrumental in communicating the needs of investment professionals in capital markets to corporates but has also provided practical advice in the form of Key Performance Indicators and interactive data formats. Thus, EFFAS has helped to enhance the integration of extra-financials in classic investment methods. Read more information about the EFFAS CESG here.

*2. EFFAS Capital Markets Commission (CMC):* The role of the capital markets is key for the allocation of financial resources throughout modern economies and therefore to enable stronger growth and the long-term development of the European economies. Over the last few years and especially after the world financial crisis of 2007, which significantly affected the banking system in many countries, European authorities have placed the efficiency of capital markets at the centre of their priorities. This is demonstrated by the launch and implementation of the Capital Markets Union (CMU), a priority within the agenda of the EU Commission. Read more information about the EFFAS CMC here.

*3. The EFFAS Commission on Financial Reporting (CFR*) provides analysts’ views on the definition of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to international accounting standards setters. Its members work closely with the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) through the Global Analysts’ group and the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) through the Users’ Panel. EFRAG provides advice to the European Commission on issues related to the implantation in Europe of IFRS. Read more information about the EFFAS CFR here.

*4. The EFFAS Commission on Training & Qualification (TQC)* is a standing commission of EFFAS.
