In 2011–17, Dercon was the chief economist of the UK Department for International Development (DfID). Before DfID, Dercon was a Professor of Development Economics at Oxford University, and the lead academic for the Ethiopia country programme at the International Growth Centre, which is a research centre based jointly at The London School of Economics and Political Science and the University of Oxford.

Between 2000-02, he was a Programme Director at the World Institute of Development Economics (WIDER), United Nations University, where he led their research programme on “Insurance against Poverty”. Prior to this, between 1993 and 2000, he was a tenured professor of development economics at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.

He is a Senior Fellow of the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD), a Research Fellow of Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and of IZA Institute of Labor Economics, and an Affiliate of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).

In 2018, the Queen awarded him as an Honorary Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for services to economics and international development. In 2021, because he also acquired British nationality, his honour was converted into a substantive one.
