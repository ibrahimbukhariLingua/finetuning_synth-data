# Andrew McAfee



**Andrew Paul McAfee** (born c. 1967) is a principal research scientist at MIT and cofounder and codirector of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He studies how digital technologies are changing the world.


## Early life and education

McAfee grew up in a small town in the mid-west. His parents divorced when he was eleven years old. Having a lack of friends growing up, and from being what he has called "socially awkward" and a bit of a math and English geek, McAfee was drawn to computers.

McAfee received his doctorate from Harvard Business School and completed two bachelors and two masters of science degrees at MIT.


## Work

Throughout his career, McAfee has written and co-written several books on digital technology and related topics. He speaks frequently to both academic and industry audiences, most notably at TED 2013 and on *The Charlie Rose Show*.


### Books

McAfee's first book, *Enterprise 2.0: New Collaborative Tools for Your Organization's Toughest Challenges*, brings together case studies and examples with key concepts from economics, sociology, computer science, consumer psychology, and management studies of how leading organizations are incorporating the web's novel tools and philosophies.

His second book, *Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy*, co-authored with Erik Brynjolfsson, brings together a range of data, examples, and research to show that the average US worker is being left behind by advances in technology.

In September 2014, he co-authored the book *Leading Digital – Turning Technology into Business Transformation*, with George Westermann (MIT) and Didier Bonnet (Capgemini Consulting).

In 2016 and 2018 McAfee cowrote two more books with Brynjolfsson, titled *The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies* and *Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future* respectively.

In October 2019, Scribner published *More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources — and What Happens Next*.
