## History

In 2012, Peter Norden became CEO of Real Estate Mortgage Network (REMN). On February 1, 2014, REMN changed its name to HomeBridge Financial Services. The company had four divisions: **Homebridge Retail** (its B2C retail lending division), **Homebridge Wholesale** (a B2B wholesale lending division), **REMN Wholesale** (a B2B wholesale lending division) and **HomeBridge Funding** (its B2B correspondent lending division). In mid-2015 HomeBridge Funding was acquired by Planet Home Lending, LLC.

In 2014 Homebridge funded $6.36 billion in home mortgage loans, and nearly $12 billion in its servicing portfolio. The company increased its funded home loans 36% in 2015 to $8.7 billion. Also in 2014, the company was ranked number ten on *Mortgage Executive* magazine's list of the "Top 100 Mortgage Companies in America". HomeBridge announced its acquisition of the operating assets of Prospect Mortgage on November 1, 2016. The company's current CEO is Peter Norden (a residential mortgage business entrepreneur).
The company's president is Joel Katz.

In August 2021, Homebridge agreed to merge with fin-tech startup Figure Technologies, which provides financial services using blockchain technology; However, this merger was cancelled on June 6, 2022 citing "regulatory delays" as being chiefly responsible.

CMG Mortgage acquired the retail division of Homebridge Financial Services on April 1, 2023.
