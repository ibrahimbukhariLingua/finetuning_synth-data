## History

SS&C was founded by William C. Stone in 1986. The company went through an initial public offering process for the first time in 1996. It was taken private in a leveraged buyout in 2005 with Sunshine Acquisition Corp., affiliated with The Carlyle Group. And after some years as a private company, SS&C was taken public again in a second IPO in 2010 through a listing on Nasdaq under the symbol SSNC.

In 2021, Mammoth Scientific selected SS&C as the administrator and technology partner for its $100 million venture capital fund. The fund is for health science and technology companies. In October, Gordian Capital started using the company’s Eze Investment Suite for its trading, portfolio, and risk management services in Singapore and Japan.

In May 2022, Liontrust Asset Management extended its mandate with SS&C. The company uses SS&C’s products to manage the majority of its £38.5 billion in assets.

In June, SS&C released a new asset allocator platform for institutional investors. It was powered by FundHub and provided fund data aggregation and analysis, holdings look-through, document management, ABOR and IBOR reporting, performance management, liquidity planning, and exposure analysis.
