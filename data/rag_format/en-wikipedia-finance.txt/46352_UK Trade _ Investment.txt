UK Trade & Investment


# UK Trade & Investment



**UK Trade & Investment** (**UKTI**) was a UK Government department working with businesses based in the United Kingdom to assist their success in international markets, and with overseas investors looking to the UK as an investment destination. It was replaced in July 2016 by the Department for International Trade.


## History

UKTI was formed in May 1999 as **British Trade International**, comprising two parts: **Trade Partners UK** (for export promotion) and **Invest UK** (for inward investment - FDI). In October 2003, the former department name and two inner departments merged and became **UK Trade & Investment** to simplify the outward recognition of the organisation, and possibly to reduce confusion with the two departments.
