Real estate investment club


# Real estate investment club



**Real estate investment club** is a club formed by individuals who want to invest specifically in real estate. Members aim to make money by investing in real estate but don't necessarily have the capital available to buy whole properties. The real estate investment clubs allow individuals to join together (which need to be distinguished from a formally established real estate investment trust, so that their money can be pooled together in order to purchase properties that they otherwise could not afford to buy.

Real estate investment clubs vary between those that focus on single family homes, and those that focus on commercial real estate. Real estate investment clubs members will often buy properties by pooling investments and then refurbish the property for resale or long term investment as rentals.

Casey Foundation and the Forest County Potawatomi Community Foundation, in order to help minority communities accumulate as much as $100,000 in assets within a decade.,
