In the same year, Passera left Poste Italiane to return to the banking world as CEO of IntesaBCI. In the summer of 2006, he managed the merger between the bank and Sanpaolo IMI, which led to the creation of Intesa Sanpaolo, where he served as Director and CEO until 2011. The following year, he promoted the establishment of Banca Prossima, a Third Sector bank dedicated to social enterprises.

The project was also presented at the UN in 2013 and was completed in terms of content in the winter of 2015.

On 18 January 2018, Passera founded "Spaxs", a SPAC active in the financial sector. Following the merger with Banca Interprovinciale in September of that year, he created illimity, a banking group dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises with potential, listed on the STAR segment of Borsa Italiana since September 2020.
