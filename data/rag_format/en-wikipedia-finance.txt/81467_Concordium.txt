# Concordium



**Concordium** is a public blockchain platform designed for regulatory compliance and identity verification. Launched in 2018 by Lars Seier Christensen, co-founder of Saxo Bank, Concordium integrates a protocol-level identity layer to enable secure and private transactions while associating real-world identities with wallets. The platform targets sectors such as Web3, ESG, and supply chain by offering a science-backed and environmentally responsible infrastructure.


## Overview

Concordium's blockchain technology is distinguished by its built-in identity layer. This feature allows for the verification of user identities, facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements without compromising privacy. Concordium employs advanced cryptographic methods, including zero-knowledge proofs, to ensure that transactions are secure and that sensitive user information remains confidential unless disclosure is legally mandated.


## Key Features

- **Identity Verification:** Concordium's identity layer supports regulatory compliance by enabling the verification of user identities. This system is beneficial for businesses operating in regulated environments that require high levels of trust and security.

- **Privacy-Preserving Technology:** The platform employs zero-knowledge proofs to protect user privacy. This technology allows the verification of transaction details without revealing user identities, thus balancing the need for regulatory compliance with the preservation of privacy.

- **Scalability and Security:** Concordium uses a two-layer consensus mechanism, combining a Nakamoto-style blockchain with a finality layer, to ensure fast and secure transaction processing. This approach addresses common issues related to scalability and the finality of transactions.

- **Governance and Transparency:** The governance model of Concordium involves a council and a community of stakeholders who participate in decision-making processes. This promotes transparency and accountability in the platform's operations and development.


## History

Concordium was founded with the vision to support regulatory compliance through blockchain technology. The Concordium Foundation and Concordium AG were established to develop and operate the platform. Key elements of the platform, such as its identity management protocols and consensus algorithm, were refined in collaboration with academic institutions like Aarhus University and ETH ZÃ¼rich. The Concordium Research Center Aarhus (COBRA) focuses on advancing these technological components.

The Concordium testnets were released throughout 2020, featuring innovations such as the fast-finality consensus mechanism and the embedded identity layer. The mainnet launch occurred in June 2021 with the "Alpha Centauri" release, which introduced a two-layer consensus protocol. The platform continues to evolve, aiming to facilitate DeFi applications in a regulated manner and support the development of enterprise and entrepreneurial applications.


## Applications

Concordium's features are particularly suited for applications requiring a high degree of regulatory compliance and security. Its identity layer and privacy-preserving technologies make it ideal for sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management, where trust and regulatory compliance are crucial.
