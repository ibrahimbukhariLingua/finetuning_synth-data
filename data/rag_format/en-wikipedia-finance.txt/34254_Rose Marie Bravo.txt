## Biography

Bravo's Italian-born father, Biagio LaPila, owned a hairdressing business in the Bronx, New York, and her Sicilian-born mother, Anna, was a seamstress. She attended the elite public Bronx High School of Science She went on to study English literature at Fordham University, graduating in 1971.

She graduated cum laude and joined Abraham and Straus' department store at Long Island as a buyer in 1971. In 1974, she was recruited by Macy's. When Macy's bought I. Magnin in 1988, she headed the acquired asset until the bankruptcy of Macy's in 1992. After five more years as President and Chief Merchant of Saks Fifth Avenue, and member of the Board of Directors of Saks Holdings Inc., Victor Barnett hired her to be chief executive of Burberry.

In her new job, she initiated a radical reform of the British classic brand and improvements of the company structure. Her strategy included signing top model Kate Moss and recruiting the young designer Christopher Bailey in 2001, who was working for Gucci at that time. The Burberry line of products was greatly increased and especially the newly added perfumes contributed to the company's raising profits. Under her tenure, Burberry launched fragrances, purses, children's wear and doggie macs.

With Bravo as a CEO, Burberry managed to expand greatly on the US market. The company's sales doubled from US$470 million to US$1 billion. The same happened to the profits, e. g. in the six months before September 30, 2003 they increased to a total of US$115 million.

In 2005, Burberry announced Bravo would step down for Angela Ahrendts, who had come from Liz Claiborne. Bravo retired as CEO but served as vice chairman of Burberry through the transition to new leadership, finally leaving the company in 2007.
