# EasyHotel



**EasyHotel** (styled as **easyHotel**) is a low-budget hotel chain with 43 hotels in 11 European countries.


## History

Originally founded by Stelios Haji-Ioannou through the easyGroup, easyHotel was incorporated in 2004 and opened its first hotel in South Kensington, London in 2005. Whilst easyHotel owned its first hotel in South Kensington (which was subsequently sold and franchised in 2007), its growth strategy in its early years was to expand via franchise contracts.

In June 2014, the Company floated on the London Stock Exchange raising £24.5 million to fund further growth and expansion. In August 2019, directors of the company backed a £139 million bid for the company despite opposition from founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou. The bidding consortium was made up of Luxembourg-based ICAMAP and Ivanhoé Cambridge of Canada. Ivanhoe is owned by Quebec’s pension company, CDPQ (Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec). As of 2021, ICAMAP and Ivanhoé Cambridge now own the majority of shares in the company. The majority owners also announced to invest € 50 million to vastly expand the chains operations by 2026 throughout Europe and the UK.

In December 2021, Karim Malak was appointed CEO after the sudden death of François Bachetta at the age of 56 in June of the same year. In October 2022, easyHotel acquired eight franchised easyHotel properties in The Netherlands and Belgium from Crossroads Real Estate for € 145 million. As of May 2024, easyHotel has 26 owned and leased easyHotel properties and 17 franchised easyHotel properties.

As of May 2024, easyHotel overall maintains 42 corporately owned and franchised branches in the United Kingdom (19, of which 5 are in London), the Netherlands (7), Switzerland (5), Germany (1), France (3), Spain (3), Belgium (1), Ireland (1), Hungary (1), Portugal (1) and Bulgaria. The formerly operated hotel in Dubai no longer exists, additionally two further locations in London were also closed.
