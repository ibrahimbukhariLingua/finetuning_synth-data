## A hallmark book in trading systems history

There are many ways to build a portfolio of different trading systems and different prices series. Emilio Tomasini started from the premise that traditional Markowitz theory, even if formally genial, has no predictive power since correlations among different prices series are varying from decade to decade. For example, correlation among energy products and industrial and transportation price series is not any longer the same today than in the seventies. It is why in "Trading systems: a new approach to systems development and portfolio optimization" . Emilio Tomasini presents for the first time ever some easy to understand and layman tools to change the cards on the table of portfolio analysis. The book has a very high evaluation on Amazon.
