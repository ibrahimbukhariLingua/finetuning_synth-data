**Nickel Asia Corporation** (NAC) is a Philippine mining company based at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig, Metro Manila which primarily mines lateritic nickel ore.


## Mining

Founded in 1969 by Manuel “Manny” B. Zamora Jr, brother of businessman Salvador “Buddy” B. Zamora and former San Juan City Congressman Ronaldo “Ronnie” B. Zamora of the Zamora family, it currently has four operational mining sites:

* The Rio Tuba mine near Bataraza town, Palawan, operated by Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corporation (RTNMC, oldest, opened in 1969, shipped nickel internationally in 1970)
* The Taganito Mine in Claver, Surigao del Norte operated by Taganito Mining Corporation
 + The Taganito HPAL Nickel Plant is situated on the coastline ~ 10 km to east of Claver at the Taganito river estuary.9°32′27″N 125°48′48″E﻿ / ﻿9.5407°N 125.8134°E﻿ / 9.5407; 125.8134
* The Hinatuan Mine (Tagana-an Nickel Project) is located on Hinatuan Island, Tagana-an, Surigao del Norte and operated by Hinatuan Mining Corporation.
* The Cagdianao Mine, with the Valencia Pit and adjacent Boa Pit in Cagdianao, Dinagat covers 249.48 square kilometers, was acquired in 1998 and is operated by the Cagdianao Mining Corporation.

Formerly Cagdianao operated the South Dingagat Mine, which was closed in October 2007 due to substantial depletion of the higher grade saprolite ore reserves. It has since reopened since 2021. They also operated the Manicani Mine, Manicani Island, Guiuan, Eastern Samar, from 1992 to 1994, and briefly again in 2001, and 2014 to 2016. But the Manicani Mine closed for good in 2016.

The main products, saprolite and limonite ore, are used by NAC's Japanese, Chinese and Australian customers to produce ferronickel and nickel pig iron (NPI).

NAC's sites were among those under critical inspection of the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources), accused of a range of environmental law violations with uncontrolled siltation and soil erosion, dust emissions cited as the main reasons amongst others. The Hinatuan site was one of 20 mining sites subsequently proposed for close-down in September 2016. In February 2017, the late Environment Secretary Gina Lopez ordered the closure of the Hinatuan Mine. The mine has since reopened after her appointment was turned down by the Commission on Appointments.
