Since 1984 an annual exhibit of plastic arts is organized, open to the public with no admission fee. Pieces can be submitted by anyone being requested no submission-fee. They are eventually admitted after being accepted by a board of experts -different each year-, who are invited as such by their reputation and positions in the world of Arts. Close to the end of the exhibit and as a way of promoting plastic arts, prizes are awarded to five different pieces in order of merit. As real proof of good will and promotion of understanding amongst peoples, not long ago one of the top prizes was awarded to a plastic artist from the Falkland Islands, bought by the Chamber of Commerce itself to be shown in one of its main meeting rooms.

The see of the Chamber also hosts frequently reputed national and international speakers from different fields of expertise, generally open to the public with no admission fee. Facilities for simultaneous translation are available in selected meeting rooms.

The building, -see of the Chamber- originally from The Bank of Spain and Río de La Plata, was restored and refurbished ad-integrum respecting its original design and materials, following present architectural paradigms, for which a special team of experts were appointed for the direction of an appropriate refurbishment in keeping with the original style of the building, officially opened by the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde in 1995.
