Remedial constructive trust


# Remedial constructive trust



A **remedial constructive trust** is a type of constructive trust recognised in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, which allows courts to give a discretionary property remedy for breaches of certain obligations, or to acknowledge various rights. It has not been recognised in English trusts law, although a number of judges have proposed that it be acknowledged.


## Australia

In Australia, the justification for the imposition of a remedial constructive trust has been based on the notion of an "unconscionable denial of beneficial interest", usually in property.
