## History

After the ending of diplomatic relations between the Republic of China and the United States in 1979, the Government of the Republic of China drew up a very crucial measures for financial and economic reform. Among them was the proposal to establish an independent research institution with government funding and financial support from the industrial and business sectors. The legal entity was to undertake the task of studying the local and international economic situation and to offer policy recommendations to the government.

After the project was approved, the Executive Yuan entrusted the Council for Economic Planning and Development to guide and plan the institution's establishment. On 1 February 1980, the council formed the preparatory body and it was named the **Preparatory Commission for Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research**. CIER was finally established on 1 July 1981.
