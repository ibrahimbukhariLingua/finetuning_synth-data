# Guardian Analytics



Nice Actimize acquired **Guardian Analytics**, an American privately held company headquartered in Mountain View, California, in August 2020 which provides behavioral analytics and machine learning technology for preventing banking fraud. It was established in 2005 and its products are based on anomaly detection to monitor financial transactions.

In 2012, Guardian Analytics together with McAfee dissected the US$78 million cyber attack titled Operation High Roller. In 2013 Guardian Analytics was listed among the Top 10 Influencers in banking information security. As of September 2016, nearly 430 financial institutions are using Guardian Analytics products to mitigate fraud risk and rely on the company to stop sophisticated criminal attacks.

In June 2020, NICE Ltd. announced the acquisition of Guardian Analytics to "extend NICE Actimize's world-class financial crime and compliance solutions across the entire financial services sector."

Between November 2022 and January 2023, Guardian Analytics was the victim of a data breach, which impacted approximately 150,000 Webster Bank customers who had sensitive personal information, including bank account and social security numbers, compromised.
