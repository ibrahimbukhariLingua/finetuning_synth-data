He was the partner in charge of the Akai Holdings account from 1991 to 1999.

In 2003, he became the president of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) and served until 2007. He was also a member of chairman councilᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ of the City University of Hong Kong from April to July 2012. Sun was later appointed as Director of Audit of Hong Kong in July 2012. He retired in December 2018.


## Controversies

When Akai went bust in 2000, the liquidators accused Ernst &Young of falsifying documents and tampering with audit documents between 1994 and 1998 to cover up the theft of over US$800m by Akai's chairman, James Ting. Ting was imprisoned for false accounting in 2005, and Ernst &Young paid $200m to settle the negligence case out of court in September 2009. In a separate lawsuit a former Ernst &Young partner, Cristopher Ho, made a "substantial payment" to Akai creditors in his role as chairman of the company that had bought Akai just before it went bust in 2000. By this time Sun was co-managing partner for Ernst &Young China; in January 2010 Ernst &Young settled another claim in relation to the bankrupt Moulin Global Eyecare, an audit client between 2002 and 2004 whose accounts were described by the liquidator as a "morass of dodginess".
