Wainwright Bank


# Wainwright Bank



**Wainwright Bank** was an American socially progressive bank based in Boston. The bank was founded in 1987 and was acquired by Eastern Bank in 2010. While it operated it was lauded as a "rebel with a cause making its reputation as a champion of social-justice causes, throwing its support behind everything from the gay-rights movement and affordable housing initiatives to immigration reform and the anti-Iraq war movement."

There were 12 branch offices in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, Newton, Watertown and Somerville. Wainwright made community development, affordable housing, civil and human rights, and other social issues a prominent focus of its activities and had a documented history of leadership in supporting social justice efforts.

Wainwright was featured in three books on this topic: in 2005, Megatrends 2010: The Rise of Conscious Capitalism by Patrician Aburdene; in 2006, named as a “truly responsible and highly profitable firm that is changing business now” in The High Purpose Company by Christine Arena; and in 2008 in the Soul of a Leader by Margaret Benefiel PhD, CEO of Executive Soul and a teacher of spirituality and leadership at Andover Newton Theological School.

In June 2010 it was announced that Wainwright would be bought by the larger local regional Eastern Bank for $163 million. The purchase was completed by the end of 2010. Wainwright branches, staff and community involvement were absorbed by Eastern Bank and the Wainwright name was dropped.


## Mission and values

The bank had been a strong advocate for universal civil rights for gays and lesbians. It testified in 1996 before the US Congressional Committee on Small Business to endorse the Employment Non-discrimination Act (ENDA). It supported equality for women by endorsing the National Organization for Women’s Women Friendly Workplace Pledge in 1997. Wainwright has been credited as a leader in urging the Massachusetts Banker’s health insurance group to offer same-sex health benefits to all its member banks.

According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank was a leader and an innovator in its community development lending efforts and had an outstanding record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, receiving an "outstanding" rating for its 2008 Community Reinvestment Act Performance Evaluation.

The bulk of Wainwright Bank and Trust Co.'s commercial loan portfolio financed socially responsible community development projects.

Wainwright made substantial commitments to environmental sustainability in its infrastructure as well as its products. The last two of its 12 branches - Coolidge Corner and Newton received Silver and Gold certifications respectively under the LEED certification system that measures how well a building or community performed across all the metrics that matter most: energy savings, water efficiency, CO₂ emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts. In 2008 Wainwright sited its 12th branch in the Dorchester, MA Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) building adjacent to the MBTA’s Ashmont Red Line Station in Dorchester.

Wainwright Bank’s Green Loan was first offered in 2001, and provides a discounted home equity loan rate for energy efficient home improvements including the installation of solar panels, passive heating systems, green roofs, wind energy and more.

Internally, the Bank had management practices that have been lauded nationally as among the most progressive. Diversity was reflected in the 22 languages spoken by employees; it was "one of the most diverse boards of any commercial bank in the country with women or minorities comprising close to 40% of the directors. Over 50% of officers were women, approximately 10% of employees were openly gay or lesbian, including two senior vice presidents, and minorities comprised over 33% of its employee base."
