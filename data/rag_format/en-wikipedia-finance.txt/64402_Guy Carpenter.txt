## History


### 1922–1999

Guy Carpenter (1869–1935) founded the company in 1922 and concluded a merger with MMC founders Henry W. Marsh and Donald R. McLennan about a year later. Concurrently, he was the manager of Atlanta-based Cotton Insurance Association, which had been organized in 1905.


#### The Carpenter Plan

*The Carpenter Plan* was based on using a rolling average of losses, over a period of years, rather than simply looking at the prior year. One result was that insurance contracts were focused more on what was *not* covered. Carpenter's contracts were more inclusive - the focus was on what was excluded. Fire insurance paid for the damage resulting from a fire. An example of how this did not work was the following:


### 2000–present

The firm occupied eight floors (47–55) in the South Tower and one (94) in the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City until the 9/11 attacks destroyed the complex in 2001.

In February 2020, Guy Carpenter & Company entered into a multi-year agreement with Karen Clark and Company (KCC) to license its catalogue of natural catastrophe models, analytics and execution software. Another area is "Cyber insurance", working with Symantec to measure "severity and frequency."
