Political Economy Club (1909)


# Political Economy Club (1909)



The **Political Economy Club** was founded in 1909 by John Maynard Keynes. It was an invitation-only club, initially held weekly in Keynes' rooms at King's College, Cambridge. Typically a paper would be read then members would comment on its contents.

Keynes made his last appearance at the club in February 1946, reading a paper about the future of pound sterling and whether the United States dollar would become scarce.
