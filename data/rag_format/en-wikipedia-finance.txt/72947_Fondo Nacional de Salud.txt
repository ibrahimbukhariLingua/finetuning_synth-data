## Choice of care

All beneficiaries are placed into four sections according to their income.

There are two types of care arrangements:

* Modality of Institutional Care: Delivered in public health facilities (clinics, rehabilitation centers and hospitals CDT).
* Free Choice Modality: Delivered by professional and private health facilities and who have signed an agreement with FONASA. Public hospitals are included in free choice modality if the recipient chooses their physician and/or are hospitalized in a private room. The focus of this modality is paid through a Health Care Bonus. The value of the bonus depends on the level of registration of the professional or health facility where he or she attends. There are three levels with 1 being the cheapest and 3 being the most expensive.
