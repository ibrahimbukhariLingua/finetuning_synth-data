He resigned the position on 2 August 2012 stating as the reason for his resignation the proposed amendments to the NBS Law, which in his opinion, substantially impair the independence of the NBS and open up the possibility of degradation and professional decision making within the NBS, which could stimulate the economic and financial instability in the country.
