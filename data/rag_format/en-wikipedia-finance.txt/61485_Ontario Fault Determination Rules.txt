Ontario Fault Determination Rules


# Ontario Fault Determination Rules



The **Ontario Fault Determination Rules** (commonly known as the **Fault Rules** or **FDR**) is a regulation under the Ontario Insurance Act enacted by the Parliament of Ontario to judge driver responsibility after car accidents in Ontario. The Fault Rules say which driver was responsible for an accident. Accidents are either 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% at fault. If the driver is from Ontario, the portion not at fault percentage is covered under Ontario's mandatory to buy Direct Compensation insurance, and the at fault portion is covered under the optional to buy Collision insurance.

A fault rating between 50–100% might affect the driver's and insurance policyholder's future risk factor and therefore future insurance rates. Note auto claim's using Specified Perils/Comprehensive for events like theft, vandalism, or hail damage are not subject to a fault rule (but may affect insurance rates and coverage depending on policyholder's claim history).

The Fault Rules are for most every accident in Ontario. However, under some rare conditions the Fault Rules do not apply and accident responsibility is determined by car accident case law. Car accidents outside of Ontario are governed by the Provincial or State where it happened. Each respective regulation is similar to these Fault Rules, but differences do exist, see the correct jurisdiction's fault rules for their details.


## Basic Rules

The Fault Rules have several basic conditions. These conditions specify that insurance companies have to use them when determining fault, and that circumstances like weather or road conditions do not matter when determining which driver was responsible.

The conditions are:

| Rule | Section |
| --- | --- |
| Insurance companies determine fault, through direct or indirection action of its insured persons, using the fault rules. | 2.1 |
| Fault is determined without caring about the circumstances, including the weather conditions, the road conditions, visibility, or actions of pedestrians. | 3.a |
| Location of the damage on a car, isn't evidence of what happened at the accident. | 3.b |


### Evidence

Determining car accident fault requires knowing what happened at the accident. Re-creating an accident can be difficult. To deal with this most fault rules have a version for knowing the details of the accident, and not knowing (ex. accidents in the middle of an all-way stop).

The following are the ways accident details are collected.

* Driver accounts to either an insurance adjuster or police officer.
* Independent witnesses.
* On site police reports (if the police say for sure what happened).
* Dashboard camera video.


### How much at fault

A car accident can have one or several Fault Rules that apply. If an accident has only one Fault Rule, then the one rule's rating puts each driver 0–100% at fault.

If there are several rules that apply then the rules below apply too.

| Rule | Section |
| --- | --- |
| If multiple rules apply to an insured person, then the one that gives the least fault is used. | 4.1 |
| However, despite 4.1, if each insured driver breaks a fault rule so each driver is both 0% at fault, and 100% at fault, then each driver is 50% at fault | 4.2 |



### What if no Fault Rule applies

| Rule | Section |
| --- | --- |
| If an incident is not described in any of the Fault Rules, then an insured driver is judged according to the ordinary rules of the road (case law). | 5.1 |
| If there isn't enough information to know what happened, then the insured driver is judged according to the case law. | 5.2 |
