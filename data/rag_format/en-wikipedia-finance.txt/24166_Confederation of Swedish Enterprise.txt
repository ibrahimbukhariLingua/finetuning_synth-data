Confederation of Swedish Enterprise


# Confederation of Swedish Enterprise



The **Confederation of Swedish Enterprise** or **Swedish Enterprise** (Swedish: *Svenskt Näringsliv*) is a major employers' organization for private sector and business sector companies in Sweden. It has 49 member associations representing 60,000 member companies with more than 1.6 million employees.


## History

The current organisation is the result of a merger between the Swedish Employers Association (Swedish: *Svenska Arbetsgivareföreningen*, abbreviated SAF) and the Swedish National Federation of Industry (Swedish: *Sveriges Industriförbund*) that was completed in March 2001.


## Policy

Like its predecessors, the organisation is actively lobbying for pro-business interests. Tax cuts, especially the abolition of property and inheritance taxes, is a main priority. The organisation also promotes letting private enterprises take over the production of a larger part of services today mainly performed by the Swedish public sector, such as education and health services.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise finances Timbro — a liberal and economically liberal think tank — via the Swedish Free Enterprise Foundation (Swedish: *Stiftelsen Fritt Näringsliv*).


## Organisation

Approximately 200 employees work in the Stockholm main office, the 22 regional offices in Sweden and the EU Brussels office. The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise is a member federation of BusinessEurope, representing 41 member federations from 34 European nations. The organization alone covers 69 per cent of private sector workers in Sweden (2017). Together with other employers' associations, the organization cover about 82 per cent of all private sector workers.
