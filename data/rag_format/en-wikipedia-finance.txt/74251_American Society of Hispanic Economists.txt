American Society of Hispanic Economists


# American Society of Hispanic Economists



The **American Society of Hispanic Economists** (ASHE) is a professional association of economists in the United States that promotes the representation of Hispanic Americans within the economics profession and supports economic research relevant to Hispanic Americans. ASHE is recognized by the American Economic Association as one of the academic organizations comprising the Allied Social Sciences Associations.


## Major activities

ASHE organizes sessions at academic conferences, including the annual meetings of the Allied Social Science Associations, the Southern Economic Association, and the Western Economic Association International. ASHE has also co-sponsored and co-organized a series of national conferences, including the 2010 and 2014 *Hispanic Economic Issues* conferences with the Americas Center of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, the 2011 *Hispanic Economic Experience* conference with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and the annual *Freedom and Justice* conferences with the National Economic Association, starting in 2014. Moreover, ASHE co-hosted the annual *Economic Issues Affecting Hispanic and African American Communities* conferences with the Department of Economics at Texas A&M University between 2007 and 2019.

During her presidency, Marie T. Mora founded the ASHE awards, including the biennial **Academic Achievement Award** (inaugurated in 2008) to recognize the impact of members on research/scholarship, and the biennial **Outstanding Service Awards** (inaugurated in 2009) to recognize the impact of the non-board members on ASHE by individuals as well as institutions and organizations. The ASHE Academic Achievement Awards are presented in even-numbered years at the annual business meeting (held at the ASSA annual meetings); the Outstanding Service Awards are presented in odd-numbered years. Mora also founded the ASHE Dissertation Fellowships (inaugurated in 2008) for Ph.D. students.

In conjunction with the American Economic Association's Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession and the National Economic Association, ASHE publishes an annual newsletter called *The Minority Report*.

Starting in 2009, ASHE's **Hispanic Economic Outlook Committee** (which was co-founded by Marie T. Mora, Mark Hugo Lopez, and Alberto Davila in 2008) began disseminating the *Hispanic Economic Outlook* reports. These reports are available at the ASHE website, and selected issues can be accessed at the Social Science Research Network website.
