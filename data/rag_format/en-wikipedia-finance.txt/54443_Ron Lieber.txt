## Early life and education

Lieber grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He attended the full 14-years of grade school at Francis W. Parker School, a private school in Chicago, becoming a scholarship student after his parents divorced.

Expecting to continue living in the Chicago area after college, Lieber decided to choose a school outside the Midwest, attending Amherst College on scholarships and financial aid. He was inspired to try writing for the *Student*, the school alumni magazine, after reading the work of Chris Miller in the publication. The summer after his junior year, he interned with the *Daily Hampshire Gazette* for three months. He graduated in 1993.


## Career

Lieber began his career in 1993 as a reporter for Lawyers Weekly USA in Boston, a legal newspaper for small law firms. His boss inspired him to want to work for *The Wall Street Journal* by bringing him clippings of Edward Felsenthal's articles . He moved on to work as a staff reporter for the *Fast Company* and *Fortune*.

In 2002, Lieber joined *The Wall Street Journal*. He was hired by Felsenthal as a founding member of the Personal Journal team. He wrote the "Green Thumb" managing-your-money column until he left in 2007.

Lieber helped start FiLife in 2007 as the managing editor. FiLife, a joint venture of Dow Jones and IAC, was a personal finance website aimed at younger readers. Lieber said the name was "a semi-mashup of Financial Life and High Life."

Lieber left FiLife in 2008 to join The New York Times as a financial columnist. He writes the "Your Money" column, which earned him three Gerald Loeb awards.

In 2023, Lieber introduced an online course on merit aid.
