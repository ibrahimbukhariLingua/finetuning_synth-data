Automated cash handling


# Automated cash handling



**Automated cash handling** refers to the process of dispensing, counting, and tracking cash within various business environments using software and hardware devices such as banknote processing. Automated cash handling is used by banks, retail stores, check-cashing outlets, payday loan/advance providers, casinos, and more. This process is facilitated through the use of specially designed hardware and software, with the primary goals of preventing loss, deterring theft, and reducing the need for constant manual oversight of cash operations.

The hardware used for automated cash handling typically includes one or more of the following:

* Automatic teller machines (ATMs)
* Currency-counting machines for notes and coins
* Currency detectors, also known as currency validator or acceptor, to check notes and coins
* Coin wrapper or rolled coin dispenser
* Banknote destruction devices
* Intelligent banknote neutralization systems

In an automated cash handling environment, a cashier or teller begins their shift by accessing a cash drawer through the automated cash handling equipment, dispensing the required cash as needed. At the end of their shift, the cashier or teller deposits the remaining cash into the automated cash handling equipment, which then counts the cash and securely stores it in a safe. To ensure proper control, a manager sets specific permissions for each teller or cashier, governing their ability to dispense and count cash.

Some advanced automated cash handling systems offer networking capabilities and remote operation, allowing for dispensing, counting, and reporting to be conducted from a central location. This remote operation not only enhances efficiency but also results in cost savings, as all cash-related activities are consolidated and monitored remotely.


## Benefits

Automated cash handling offers a range of significant benefits, including:

* Reduced Manual Labor: Automation minimizes the need for manual cash handling tasks, leading to increased efficiency and reduced labor costs.
* Faster Customer Service: Automated systems expedite transactions, resulting in quicker and more efficient customer service experiences.
* Enhanced Safety: With fewer person-to-person interactions, automated cash handling contributes to safer and more secure transactions.
* Consistent Reliability: Automated systems are designed for precision and accuracy, ensuring consistent and reliable cash management.
* Cost-Efficiency: Automated cash handling is often a cost-effective alternative to hiring additional employees, making it a cost-efficient solution for businesses.

## Disadvantages

While automated cash handling offers numerous advantages, it also comes with a few disadvantages, including:

* Regular System Maintenance: Automated systems require ongoing maintenance to ensure their operating systems run smoothly. This maintenance can involve software updates, hardware upkeep, and troubleshooting.
* Job Displacement: Advanced automated cash handling systems, which require minimal human interaction, can lead to the displacement of certain jobs. This can have an impact on employment opportunities in roles that were previously centered around manual cash handling tasks.

## Role in economy

Automated cash handling systems play diverse and vital roles in everyday economic activities. Beyond their primary function of dispensing money and processing checks, these systems have expanded into various sectors, bringing efficiency and security to a range of processes.

* Prison Transactions: In the corrections system, automated cash handling systems facilitate electronic transfers of funds from inmates' relatives to prisoners. This streamlined process is significantly faster and more efficient compared to traditional manual transfers. Moreover, it acts as a deterrent against fraud and theft among inmates.
* Retail Revolution: In 1987, automated cash handling systems gained popularity among retailers nationwide. The effectiveness and speedy checkouts they provided encouraged customers to use debit/credit cards, making them an attractive option for businesses. As a result, many establishments adopted these systems to enhance customer satisfaction.
* Gas Stations: In regions where self-service at gas stations is prohibited, automated cash handling systems have played a crucial role as crime deterrents and cost-effective solutions. With these systems in place, gas attendants no longer face the risk of robbery. The entire transaction process is computerized, ensuring faster transactions. Additionally, these systems allow petroleum companies to reduce costs and enhance security.

Automated cash handling systems have evolved to become integral components of various industries, offering efficiency, security, and convenience in economic operations.


## Effect on banking jobs

The rise of automated cash systems in the 1980s has significantly transformed the way society operates, particularly within the banking sector. Banks have adapted their operations to harness the capabilities of these advanced systems, leading to notable changes in the roles of bankers and the handling of money.

* Shift in Banker Roles: Traditional bankers who primarily handled physical money have witnessed a significant shift in their roles. They are now increasingly engaged in sales and advisory positions rather than performing the traditional tasks of cash handling.
* Automated Money Management: Automated cash systems have revolutionized the money-handling process within banks. These systems are adept at counting and dispensing money accurately, reducing the need for manual counting and verification by bankers.

This transformation within the banking industry underscores the evolution of banking practices and the integration of technology to enhance efficiency and customer service.
