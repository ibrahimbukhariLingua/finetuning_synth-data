The New York Times "Deal Book" writer, Steven Davidoff Solomon, among critics of the litigation, chided Fricklas for creating "a case that just served to make a crazy situation crazier while wasting millions of dollars." Ultimately, Fricklas was credited for "helping to shape the rules of the road in posting online content," and The New York Times noted that Viacom saw, in the settlement with the book publishers, an acknowledgement that Google needed to pay creators.

**CBS:** Fricklas worked on deals to tie and untie Viacom with CBS, including Viacom's merger with CBS (2000), split-off with CBS Corp. (2005), and the Blockbuster split-off (2004).

**Viacom Headquarters Lease:** Fricklas did the deal that built out the company's space to 1.6 million square feet for its Times Square headquarters office, a big economic win for New York City, according to Real Estate Weekly.
