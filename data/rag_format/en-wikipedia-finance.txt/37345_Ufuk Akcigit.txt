## Life

Ufuk Akcigit was born to Turkish parents in Germany. He lived in Germany until he was four years old and his parents relocated to their hometown of Bursa.

He was interested in Mathematics and Economics from an early age and completed middle and high school at Ankara Anatolian High School. In 2003, he obtained his bachelor's degree in economics from Koç University after which, he pursued his doctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He earned a Ph.D. degree in 2009 with his dissertation: Essays on growth and innovation policies.

His thesis adviser was Daron Acemoğlu, with whom he has since collaborated.


## Academic career

After his doctoral studies, Akcigit began working as an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2015, he joined the University of Chicago as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2018 and then to a full Professor in 2019. In 2020 he was named the Arnold C. Harberger Professor in Economics and the College.

As part of his work at the University of Chicago, Akcigit founded the Akcigit Research Team (ART). This research group runs as a lab, using large-scale firm and individual level micro datasets to uncover how talent allocation, human capital, industrial policies, competitive landscape, academia, and institutions influence economic growth through innovation and ideas.[⁶] As winner of the Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award, Akcigit also manages a dedicated research team in Germany that focuses on the Economic Gap between East and West Germany.

Akcigit's research has been acknowledged with a number of roles and awards. In 2016 he was named Distinguished Research Fellow by Koç University. In 2021, Akcigit was named Econometric Society Fellow and John Simon Guggenheim Fellow. In 2022, he received the Global Economy Prize in Economics from the Kiel Institute in Germany and the Sakıp Sabancı International Research Award.

Akcigit currently holds Research Associate positions at the National Bureau of Economic Research, Center for Economic Policy Research, Brookings Institution, Halle Institute, Rimini Centre for Economic Analysis, and CESifo.


## Research

As a macroeconomist, Akcigit's research focuses on understanding the links between innovation and policies to support economic growth. He is a pioneer in the field of quantitative economic growth, which combines economic models with micro-level data. His research focuses on three main aspects that connect innovation and aggregate economic growth: firms, inventors, and ideas.

In his research on firms, Akcigit has focused on different types of innovations, and the quality of these innovations have important economic growth implications. Looking at the life cycle of firms and innovation in developing countries, his work demonstrates that these countries suffer from low creative destruction. He also studies the interplay of taxation and innovation, uncovering what incentives governments provide to firms to innovate using taxes and subsidies.

As part of his contributions to the concept of creative destruction, Akcigit examines inventors themselves to uncover their incentives to innovate and their effect on society. He focuses on modern-time inventors, historical inventors, and their interactions in society. In this research, he investigates the factors determining who becomes an inventor and uncovers that IQ, education and parental background are key ingredients.

Akcigit also focuses on how ideas are generated and how they are materialized. He argues that ideas are not necessarily born to the best users to ensure utilization; an established patent system is crucial for idea transformation. He uses large scale datasets such as social security records, firm balance sheets and patent microdata to advance his research.

Taking a step back to look at the business dynamism and market dynamics themselves, Akcigit argues that upon decreased knowledge diffusion, corporate market power has risen in recent decades. This resulted in an increased corporate market power and market concentration. He then examines how firms respond to these changing dynamics in the economy. He uses firm and state-based micro data to uncover these effects. With a group of researches from the International Monetary Fund, Akcigit investigated these issues across different countries, publishing their findings on a report entitled "Rising Corporate Market Power: Emerging Policy Issues".

Finally, he focuses on income inequality arguing that innovation is positively correlated with the former. He uses cross-state panel U.S. Data to work on income inequality and social mobility.
