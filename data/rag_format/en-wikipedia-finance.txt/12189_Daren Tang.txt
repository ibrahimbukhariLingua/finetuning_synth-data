#### Tenure

Tang took office as World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Director General on October 1, 2020, beginning a six-year term. In his acceptance speech, Tang said: *“WIPO must work towards a vibrant and forward-looking global intellectual property (IP) ecosystem. It must help the world broaden its perspective of IP beyond its legal and technical aspects to its powerful role as a supporter of entrepreneurs and enterprises, catalyst for investments, driver of economic growth and a promoter of social vibrancy.”*

Tang's administration presented to WIPO's member states a medium-term strategic plan to guide the organization's work through 2026. Under the plan, the WIPO secretariat would work more closely with smaller enterprises and individual innovators and creators, who have previously been underserved by the global intellectual property ecosystem. Youth would be a particular focus. The plan aims for WIPO to continue the provision of high-qualityᵖᵉᵃᶜᵒᶜᵏᵖʳᵒˢᵉ international IP filing services for patents, trademarks, designs and other IP rights while maintaining fiscal prudence and supporting Member States in their negotiations. Tang's administration launched a new “IP and Innovation Ecosystems Sector” to focus on 'intellectual property commercialization'.

> *The ultimate purpose of IP is to change people's lives for the better, help entrepreneurs grow their businesses, improve society, and contribute to economic development.* Daren Tang, 2021
