### Federal CIO

Prior to her appointment, President Trump established the American Technology Council and issued the *Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure* (Executive Order 13800) establishing, that it is "the policy of the United States to manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise."

As CIO, Kent was responsible for setting federal IT policy and leading the Federal CIO Council, which is composed of CIOs from various federal government departments and agencies. Under the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), federal agency program officials, chief information officers, and inspectors general (IGs) are required to conduct annual reviews of each agency's information security program and report the results to the OMB. The effectiveness of FISMA to date has been flawed by several high-profile security breaches in systems that should have been subject to regular FISMA reviews, for example the 2014 and 2015 Office of Personnel Management data breach.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
