### Tron Series

The **Tron** was the first electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) fixed-wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) developed by Quantum-Systems. It served as the foundational platform for subsequent developments within the company. The Tron can carry payloads and sensors weighting up to 2 kg. This model was discontinued in December 2020. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
