## Reception

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 85% of 26 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "A feel-good underdog story loosely rooted in real events, *Bank of Dave* may not be the most memorable movie of its type, but it's got sweetness and charm to spare."

Writing in *The Guardian*, Cath Clarke judged that, "Rory Kinnear is brilliant as Fishwick, who made his fortune selling vans and minibuses but has never forgotten his roots", adding that, "Kinnear gives the character a winning mix of down-to-earth blokiness with a rags-to-riches flamboyance (and a bit of ego to match the flash car)". However, Clarke found that "[t]he rest of the characters feel as if they might have been generated by an algorithm" although she noted that "Hugh Bonneville gives good sneer as a fatcat banker". Overall, she decided, "It’s a film with a decent bit of charm, and it’s hard to argue with the greed-is-bad message. [...] But an artificial taste ruins a fair few scenes".


## True story

The film gives a disclaimer at the start saying it is "true(ish)". While the basic story and some of the locations are true (scenes were even filmed in Dave Fishwick's own home), much of the film is fictional.

* The lawyer (actually two lawyers, Keith Arrowsmith and Chris Moss) were based in Manchester and both married already
* There was no senior banker, "Sir Charles Denbigh" in the film, who tipped off the Burnley police to bring a prosecution
* The rock band Def Leppard did not perform at a fund-raising concert at Turf Moor. The band flew from the US just to film their cameo in the film.
* A true bank has not yet been established and is actually Burnley Savings and Loans, a legal peer-to-peer lender. The capital demanded by the FSA was never raised and so the company is still in the process of getting a banking licence. Above the door is a sign saying "Bank on Dave", which avoids claiming that it is a bank

## Sequel

A sequel film, *Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger*, was released on 10 January 2025, with Rory Kinnear reprising his role.
