## Reception

A negative review by *Financial Times*' Chris Giles criticised that the book is "short of answers" and has a "casual disregard for facts". Giles further commented that the book lacks "an intellectually coherent whole" because of its "inconsistencies and omissions". Terrence Fernsler of *Nonprofit World* viewed the book as offering a good economic perspective on non-profits, writing that it "describes the consequences of blind faith in the current economic system". Aditya Chakrabortty of *The Guardian* commented that obstacles to McDonnell's economic goals were "well laid out" in *Economics for the Many*.

*Dagbladet Information*'s Ben Tarnoff found that the book contained a "number of concrete proposals" but criticised the absence of class struggle. Tarnoff believed the book was "deeply interesting" and gave "excellent overview of the economic ideas behind Corbynism". Luke Savage, writing for *Jacobin*, argued that the book was "a programmatic sketch of radical left thinking for the twenty-first century". Savage praised its content as "accessible and minimally abstract" and for describing "how real, dynamic, practical alternatives to dominant economic thinking can be imagined and promoted" .

In a speech as Chancellor of the Exchequer for the Conservative second Johnson ministry, Rishi Sunak joked that the book was in the genre of "works of fantasy", calling it a "little-read book" as a pun on *The Little Red Book*.
