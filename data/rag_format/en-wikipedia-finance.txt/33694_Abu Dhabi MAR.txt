As per the partnership agreement signed by the two companies, the 50/50 joint venture would see TKMS retain a lead role and know-how in all projects with the German Navy and NATO partners; while Abu Dhabi MAR Group was responsible for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). It was also agreed that Abu Dhabi MAR would be acquiring 80% of TKMS' key three surface ship firms: Blohm+Voss Shipyards, Blohm + Voss Repair GmbH, and Blohm + Voss Industries.
