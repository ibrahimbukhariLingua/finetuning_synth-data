## Advocacy


### ICANN price caps decision

In July 2019, Namecheap was one of the organizations that filed a reconsideration request to ICANN asking for a review of the decision to remove price caps on .org and .info TLDs. As of September 2019, ICANN has ignored such requests.


### Termination of service to Russian accounts

In February 2022, Namecheap announced that they would terminate services to Russian accounts due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, citing "war crimes and human rights violations". Existing users were given a one-week grace period to move their domains. The next day, the deadline was extended by another 2 weeks. If users did not move their domains, their websites became inaccessible, even if the domain registration period had not yet passed. The company also announced that it would be offering free anonymous domain registration and web hosting to all protest and anti-war websites in Russia or Belarus. Namecheap at the same time said it had over 1,000 employees located in Ukraine, comprising most of its support staff, mostly in Kharkiv (which was a major location of fighting).
