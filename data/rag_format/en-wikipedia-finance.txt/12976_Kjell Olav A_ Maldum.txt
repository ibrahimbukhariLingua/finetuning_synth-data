## Advocating for environment

Maldum is especially engaged in packaging optimizing and circular economy. His commitment has led Infinitum to be the first deposit-return-scheme in the Nordics to recycle plastic bottles within its own country border. The Norwegian deposit-return scheme has gained significant international interest. Maldum welcomes international delegations to the sorting facility, and provides information on the benefits and how to implement similar models in other countries.

## Special initiatives

* Coca-Cola switching to deposit bottles

Until 2014 Coca-Cola has been using non-deposit bottle for its beverages in Norway. Kjell Olav Maldum played a central role in negotiations for Coca-Cola Norway switching from non-deposit refillable bottles to non-refillable deposit bottles. The move was considered as an environmentally friendly one to introduce deposit on bottles and decrease littering, but it also led to downsizing of Coca-Cola in Norway due to less labor needed for one-way bottles and made headline in Norwegian market about the job losses and also counter-arguments Coca-Cola Norway also promised to invest in recycling facilities inside Norway.

* Recycling cans in Norway

Maldum was also behind the efforts that finally led to the recycling of aluminum cans performed in Norway. The aluminum cans that have been collected in Norway were used to be sent to France for recycling but it has been recycled by Norsk Hydro in Holmestrand since 2014. The move was considered as environmentally friendly step vowing for recycling 60,000 mt of aluminium annually in Holmestrand.
