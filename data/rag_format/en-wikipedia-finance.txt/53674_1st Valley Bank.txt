## History

1st Valley Bank was originally two banks: the Rural Bank of Kapatagan Valley and the Rural Bank of Sinacaban in Misamis Occidental.

The Rural Bank of Kapatagan Valley was incorporated on September 11, 1956, and was granted an authority to operate on November 24 of the same year, becoming the Philippines' seventy-fifth rural bank, initially starting with an initial capital of forty thousand pesos. It eventually became a member of the prestigious Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines on April 5, 1957.

On April 3, 2004, the stockholders of the Rural Bank of Kapatagan Valley approved the recommendation of its board of directors to consolidate with the Rural Bank of Sinacaban. On August 30, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued the consolidated bank's Certificate of Consolidation and the corresponding certificate of incorporation of the merged institution, by then known as 1st Valley Bank.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas granted 1st Valley Bank's authority to operate on September 21 of that year.

In 2007 the bank was one of several rural banks enabled with wireless ATMs.
