## History

The company was founded in New York City by Frederick Leypoldt, a German immigrant who worked as a bookseller and recognized the need for good bibliographic information to make the book business more efficient. He established the monthly *Literary Bulletin,* his first periodical, in 1868. In 1870 Leypoldt issued the first edition of his *Annual American Catalogue*, the forerunner for *Books in Print*. In 1872 he published the first issue of *Publishers Weekly*, in 1873 the first *Publishers' Uniform Trade-List Annual* (later the *Publishers Trade List Annual*), and in 1876 the first issue of *Library Journal*. In 1878 Leypoldt's company was acquired by Richard Rogers Bowker. Leypoldt and Bowker also founded two influential standard book-industry references: *Literary Marketplace* and *Ulrich's Periodicals Directory*.
