List of largest banks


# List of largest banks



The following are lists of the largest banks in the world, as measured by total assets and market capitalization.


## By total assets

This list is based on the April 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence report of the 100 largest banks in the world. The ranking was based upon total assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments. Another publication which compiles an annual list of the world's largest banks is *The Banker* magazine. It publishes a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks every July. The financial data published by the July yearly issue of *The Banker* are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it is not a publication intended for the general public.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The KfW bank is manually inserted due to its assets of c. 650 billion.

Accounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks. When adjusted for this netting, JPMorgan Chase would have US$ 4,359.78 billion in total assets, rather than US$3,875.39 billion.
