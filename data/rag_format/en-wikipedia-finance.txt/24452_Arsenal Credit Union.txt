Arsenal Credit Union


# Arsenal Credit Union



**Arsenal Credit Union** (ACU) provides financial products and services to people who live and work in the St. Louis metropolitan area. The credit union is chartered and regulated under the authority of the Missouri Division of Credit Unions. Member deposits are federally insured to at least $250,000 by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), a U.S. government agency. The credit union has five branches and is headquartered in Arnold, Missouri. ACU is the 7th-largest credit union in St. Louis and the 9th-largest in Missouri based on asset size ($420 million as of January 2025).


## History

Arsenal Credit Union was founded in August 1948 as Aero Chart Credit Union and organized to serve employees of a U.S. government agency then known as the Aero Chart Service, Plant and Store (now the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or NGA). The name changed to Arsenal Credit Union in 1952, a tribute to what NGA's current campus, along the banks of the Mississippi River in south St. Louis, used to be known as the "St. Louis Arsenal" back in the country's Civil War days. During this time, the site had warehoused small arms, artillery, gun carriages, ammunition and gunpowder.

## Community Impact Fund

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofit organizations began to struggle due to a lack of donations coming in. Arsenal Credit Union sought a way to help area nonprofits better serve their clients. The Arsenal Community Impact Fund was created to help these organizations do what they do best: serve the community in the unique ways they're equipped to do so. To date, Arsenal has awarded $69,900 to over 30 organizations in the community.
