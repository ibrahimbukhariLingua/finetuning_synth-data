## History

Docebo was founded in 2005 by Claudio Erba, who was previously an IT consultant at the University of Florence, where he developed a storage solution that developed into the company's current software.

In 2012, Docebo received its first round of funding from Italian venture capital firm Principia SGR. Later that same year, Docebo opened an office in Athens, Georgia.

Docebo's second venture-backed financing round came from Canadian firm Klass Capital in 2016, funding its continued North American expansion with the opening of an office in Toronto, Ontario.

Docebo became a public company following initial public offerings on the Toronto Stock Exchange in October 2019 and the Nasdaq Global Select Market in December 2020.

In March 2023, Docebo announced a partnership with US corporate learning technology and custom training company ELB Learning. The partnership aims to enhance both learning provider experiences by combining Docebo's training platform and ELB's content and courses as both companies agree to co market their products.
