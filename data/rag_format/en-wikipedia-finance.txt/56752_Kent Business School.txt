Kent Business School


# Kent Business School



**Kent Business School (KBS)** is the business school of the University of Kent. Although there are two business schools known as **KBS**, generally people seem to consider **KBS** as King's Business School first because it was established in 1980, eight years before Kent Business School. Since opening in 1988, it offers undergraduate, postgraduate, PhD degree programmes and The Kent MBA.

KBS is sited in two locations, at The University of Kent campus in Canterbury and at Medway on Chatham Historic Dockyard.

In March 2017, Kent Business School at the Canterbury Campus moved into its new home, The Sibson Building, named after the University of Kent's third Vice-Chancellor, Professor Robin Sibson.
