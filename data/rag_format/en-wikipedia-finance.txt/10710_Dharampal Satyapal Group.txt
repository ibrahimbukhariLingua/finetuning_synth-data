## CSR


### Water Conservation

In 2018, the DS Group started the Water Economic Zone (WEZ) project in Udaipur, Rajasthan. The project aimed to manage natural resources such as water and soil. For the WEZ project, the DS Group received an award from Union Tribal Affairs Minister, Arjun Munda, in the category of Environment Sustainability at the 20th FICCI CSR Awards. In this project, approximately 11,000 hectares of land in the Alsigarh and Kurabad areas of Udaipur district in Rajasthan were modified. Over 900 structures for rainwater collection were erected by the corporation. This allowed irrigation on 2,300 hectares of land.


### Education

DS Group launched a project called Creativity Adda in partnership with Shikshantar Andolan; its stated goal was to promote skill-based education for students in an all-boys government-aided school (grades 6–12) in Darya Ganj, Old Delhi. This project was developed in collaboration with Commercial School and DS Group. The project has an "unschool" attend-daily from 2–5 p.m.


### SaluteTheFarmHER

In 2023, DS Group launched the SaluteTheFarmHER campaign, a project aimed at highlighting the role of women in agriculture. The initiative was conceived by Grapes and officially launched on International Women's Day in March 2023.


## Controversies


### Plastic ban violation

In 2011, the Supreme Court of India issued a contempt notice to DS Group for violating its order against using plastic sachets to sell products. The company attempted to bypass the Supreme Court's ban on selling products in plastic pouches by falsely labeling them as "only for export", despite being sold domestically at a price of ₹6.


### Tax evasion

In 2015, officials from the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence conducted searches at 25 locations of DS Group's companies across several states, based on gathered intelligence. The investigation revealed that fake invoices for declared goods, labeled as "sandalwood compound or oil", were issued to Messrs Dharampal Satyapal Limited through dummy factories in the Haridwar–Roorkee area, Kanpur, and Lucknow. Owners of these dummy supplier firms admitted to generating bills for DSL on a commission basis without manufacturing or obtaining clearance for declared goods. Allegedly, DS Group evaded taxes by claiming inadmissible Cenvat credit, totaling ₹90 crore (US$10 million).

In 2019, the company was involved in a ₹900 crore (US$100 million) scam, which revolved around the avoidance of value-added tax (VAT) on tobacco products. As per the state Criminal Investigation Department, the directors of Dharmpal Satyapal Limited and the Gujarat trade were implicated in importing gutka and other tobacco products into the state without proper documentation, selling them in the market, and thereby avoiding the payment of VAT.


### Sealing of Guwahati factory

In 2022, the Mumbai Crime Branch closed down the company's Guwahati facility after discovering that the Pan masala produced by the company in Guwahati was discovered in the possession of a dealer in Solapur (Maharashtra), where the manufacturing, selling, and storage of Pan masala are prohibited. But, within a fortnight, the factory was de-sealed as per the Guwahati High Court order.


## Litigations

In 2016, the Supreme Court imposed a fine of ₹4 crore (US$460,000) to Dharampal Satyapal Limited for breaching commitments and causing delays in resolving a 2009 tax dispute. DSL contested a ₹244 crore (US$28 million) tax demand related to Central Excise Duty, briefly applied to the Settlement Commission without reaching an agreement, faced a dismissal of its petition by the Delhi High Court, and sought relief from the Supreme Court in 2013, securing a stay order against the tax demand.
