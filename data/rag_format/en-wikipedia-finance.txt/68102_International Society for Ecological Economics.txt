The **International Society for Ecological Economics** (**ISEE**) was founded in 1989, based heavily on the work of Herman Daly to promote ecological economics and assist ecological economists and related societies.

In 1996, the Right Livelihood Award was awarded to steady-state theorist Herman Daly "for defining a path of ecological economics that integrates the key elements of ethics, quality of life, environment and community". He was honored as one of the key figures in the foundation of ISEE, which is considered to be "a transdisciplinary partnership of scholars and professionals from a broad range of backgrounds". Through education, research, policy and social action, it fosters transformation towards an equitable and ecologically sustainable society with respect for human rights, biological and cultural diversity. At the heart of this, it recognizes that the human economy is part of a finite biosphere and should be subjected to ecological limits. Dr. Daly was also awarded the 2014 Japanese Blue Planet Award.
