## History

Before being established as Chamber of Commerce, the representation office was an overseas station of National Intelligence Coordinating Board (predecessor of Indonesian State Intelligence Agency) which established in 1967 known as *Kantor Taipei* (Taipei Office). In 1970, the representation office developed into *Kamar Dagang Indonesia di Taipei* (Indonesian Chamber of Commerce in Taipei) jointly staffed by National Intelligence Coordinating Board, Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Directorate General of Immigration. In 1990s, its economical function expanded, thus additional staffs from the Investment Coordinating Board and Department of Trade recruited to man the office.

Until 1994, despite being a trade office, this office was placed under the National Intelligence Coordinating Board supervision. Since 7 July 1994, the office moved under the Department of Trade (now Ministry of Trade) supervision thru Presidential Decree No. 48/1994 until the present day and renamed to its current name.
