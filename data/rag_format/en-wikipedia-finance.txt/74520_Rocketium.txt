## History

Rocketium was founded by former colleagues from TaxiForSure, Anurag Diwedi, and Satej Sirur.

The company launched as a game-based content platform aimed at making educational and informative quizzes and simulation games. The founders pivoted to building a video-making tool in June of 2016 when they saw the growing trend of online videos and realized there was a lack of scale-able and user-friendly video creation platforms. This self-service tool was aimed at the B2C segment of non-designers, like social media marketers, content writers, and journalists.

Rocketium soon partnered with Amazon to create a self-service ad creation platform for advertisers who wanted to promote their products on Amazon.

After raising $3.2 million in seed funding, Rocketium pivoted again to become a creative automation platform, with the intention of enabling enterprises to scale their creative production. However, realizing the problems present in the existing creative infrastructure of most enterprises, Rocketium evolved instead into a creative operations platform. Its stated goal is to be a holistic solution to scale creative production while enabling AI-powered brand compliance, smart collaboration, and asset management. Rocketium supports integrations with multiple eCommerce and advertising platforms, APIs, and tools, such as Dropbox, Slack, Facebook ads, Google Drive, and Thirdlight, and can custom-build integrations a brand needs.

Rocketium also went on to develop creative analytics aimed at enterprises. Rocketium has worked with several Fortune 500 and Global 2K companies.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
