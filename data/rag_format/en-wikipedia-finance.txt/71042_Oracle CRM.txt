Oracle CRM


# Oracle CRM



**Oracle CRM** is a customer relationship management system created by Oracle Corporation. It includes a number of different cloud applications that can be deployed together or used individually to analyze customer data and help companies connect and manage sales, marketing, and customer support.


## History

Oracle hired Mark Barrenechea in 1997 to build a CRM development team. That development team evolved into the CRM division of Oracle in 1998, the first year that Oracle CRM was released. Later, Barrenechea was responsible for the CRM half of Oracle's E-Business Suite (EBS) when he helped to bridge the separation between CRM and ERP by creating a single database that covered marketing, sales, order management, and accounting. This allowed Oracle to automate the entire CRM business flow, from lead to billing.


### Transition to Oracle Advertising and CX

In 2012, Oracle announced a new cloud-based focus on customer experience (CX) within its CRM business. At the time, CX was a relatively new term and referred to â€œthe notion of providing a much more personalized approach to marketing and support." In 2021, Oracle combined its CX products with those from Oracle Data Cloud and renamed them Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX). Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX) is the name of Oracle's CRM system in the cloud.
