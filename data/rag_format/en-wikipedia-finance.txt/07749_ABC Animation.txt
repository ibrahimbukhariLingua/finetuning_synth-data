# ABC Animation



**ABC Animation, Inc.** is a Japanese animation planning, production and content company that serves as a subsidiary of the Asahi Broadcasting Group Holdings Corporation. Based in Shinjuku, Tokyo, the company was formed as part of a spin-off of ABC's animation co-production business into a separate company, as part of a major restructuring of ABC's restructuring of its content production division. ABC Animation also owns animation studio Silver Link as well as other companies such as Zero G Act and CGCG Studio. The company is responsible for the planning and production of anime, including films and television series as well as content sales and licensing. Among these is Toei Animation's long-running magical girl series *Pretty Cure* which has been airing since 2004. Since the shows air on a daytime slot, all entries from 2016 onwards are co-produced jointly with ABC Television, which previously solely handled co-production duties from the franchise's first entry in 2004. ABC-A began co-producing the series since *Witchy Pretty Cure*.


## History

ABC announced its plans to establish ABC Animation on March 4, 2016. Masayuki Nishide, a producer for ABC's animation productions as well as managing the company's content business division is appointed as its first president on May 10 of that year. The company inherited ABC Television's animation planning and production business two months later and became a subsidiary of ABC Frontier Holdings. On April 1, 2021, the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC Group Holdings. On October 1, 2023, Silver Link and Zero G Act became subsidiaries of the company and as a result, ABC Animation became the core company of the group's animation business. On October 26, 2023, ABC-A announced its intention to buy CGCG Studio; the sale was completed on December of that year. On August 8, 2024, Toysium became a subsidiary of the company.
