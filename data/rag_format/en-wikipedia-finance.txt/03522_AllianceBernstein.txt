## History


### Origins

AllianceBernstein traces its origins back to the founding of Sanford C. Bernstein in 1967 as an investment-management firm for private clients. Sanford C. Bernstein & Company was originally co-founded by Zalman Bernstein, Paul P. Bernstein, Shepard D. Osherow, Roger Hertog and Lewis A. Sanders.

Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment-management department of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. merged with the investment-advisory business of Moody's Investor Services, Inc.


### 2000–2020

In October 2000, Alliance Capital acquired Sanford C. Bernstein. Alliance Capital's growth equity and corporate fixed-income investing, and its family of retail mutual funds, accompanied Bernstein's value equity and tax-exempt fixed-income management and its private-client business.

On January 20, 2015, AllianceBernstein announced a new brand name ("AB") and logo.

In 2019, AllianceBernstein partnered with Columbia University to provide training courses on sustainability and environmental sciences to its staff of investors.

In 2019, Alliance Bernstein was flagged by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement as a subsidiary of AXA through which the French insurance group maintained indirect investments in Elbit Systems and Israeli banks despite a partial divestment by the parent company.

In June 2020, AllianceBernstein acquired investment management firm AnchorPath for $400 million.
