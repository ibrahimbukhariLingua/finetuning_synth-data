# Dream11



**Dream11** is an Indian fantasy sports platform that allows users to play daily fantasy sports contests, primarily in cricket. In April 2019, Dream11 became the first Indian fantasy sport company to become a unicorn. In November 2021, Dream11 was valued at $8 billion. In October 2023, Dream11 claimed to have 200 million users.


## History

Dream11 was co-founded by Harsh Jain (son of Indian businessman Anand Jain) and Bhavit Sheth in 2008. In 2012, they introduced freemium fantasy sports in India for cricket fans. In 2014, the company reported 1 million registered users, which grew to 2 million in 2016 and to 45 million in 2018.

In April 2019, Steadview Capital completed secondary investment in Dream11. Apart from Steadview, Dream11's investors included Kalaari Capital, Think Investments, Multiples Equity and Tencent. In April 2019, they launched FanCode, an ad-free multi-sport aggregator platform offering content, commerce and community engagement.

In 2021, Dream 11's parent company, Dream Sports raised $840 million in a funding round led by Tiger Global, D1 Capital, Falcon Edge, DST Global, and Redbird Capital.


## Legality

In 2017, a case was registered against the company in an Indian High Court. The court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Dream11 game involves superior knowledge, judgement and attention. The Court also held that "the element of skill" had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Dream11 game. However, the law does not allow fantasy sports in a few Indian states like Assam, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. A challenge to this judgement was filed with the Supreme Court of India, which dismissed the appeal. The judgement provided legality to the company and allowed them to run their operations throughout the country.

In October 2021, Dream11 suspended its operations in Karnataka after the state prohibited online gambling and wagering. In February 2022, Dream11 resumed operations in the state after the Karnataka High Court reversed the ban on online gambling and repealed a complaint lodged against the company.

Despite it being adjudged to be a "game of skill", experts believe that the company operates in the country's regulatory "grey area".


## Partnerships

In 2017, the company partnered with three leagues within cricket, football and basketball. Dream11 became the Official Fantasy Partner for Caribbean Premier League, Indian Super League and US professional basketball league National Basketball Association (NBA). Later in the year, they partnered with the Indian Super League as their official Fantasy Football Partner. In November 2017, the NBA, launched a fantasy basketball game in association with Dream11 and launched their official NBA fantasy game on their platform.

In 2018, Dream11 announced its partnership with International Cricket Council (ICC), Pro Kabaddi League, International Hockey Federation (FIH), WBBL and BBL. In 2018, through the above partnership, Dream11 introduced two new games on their platform viz., kabaddi and hockey.

In October 2019, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) announced Dream11 as the title sponsor for the Super Smash domestic Twenty20 competition. In January 2021, this partnership was extended for another six years until 2026.

On 18 August 2020, Dream11 won the title sponsorship rights for the 2020 Indian Premier League for ₹222 crore (US$29.96 million), after Vivo pulled out for the season.

On 30 June 2023, Dream11 acquired the lead jersey sponsorship rights of the Indian National Cricket Team from July 2023 till March 2026 for ₹358 crore.
