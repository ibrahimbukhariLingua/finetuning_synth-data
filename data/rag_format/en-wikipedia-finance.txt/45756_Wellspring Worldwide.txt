## History

Wellspring was founded in 2003, spinning out of Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Mellon University and initially providing software systems, consulting services and training programs for university technology transfer offices in North America and Europe. Wellspring had European operations in Lisbon, Portugal from 2006-2008 and in Cambridge, United Kingdom from 2008-2011.

By 2020, Wellspring built its headquarters in Chicago. As of 2024, the company enlisted its global headquarters in Arvada, Colorado.

In 2007, Wellspring launched a services program in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to help incubate university-based start-up companies. It was followed by the 2008 release of Sophia Knowledge Management System and Technology Gateway, that allow universities to market research projects and intellectual property available for licensing.

In January 2010, Wellspring acquired **Flintbox**, a company founded in 2003 at the University of British Columbia to provide a location for universities to post available research projects and intellectual property. Flintbox also provided the technology behind Kauffman's iBridge Network. This acquisition was followed in 2011 by the acquisition of online intellectual property marketing site **FolioDirect**.

In 2023, Wellspring acquired **IG Pragmatics**, a London-based intellectual property and technology transfer consulting firm. IG Pragmatics, founded in 2001, continues as Wellspring (IP Pragmatics Ltd),

In July 2022, the private equity firm Resurgens Technology Partners announced a major investment in Wellspring. In June 2023, Wellspring underwent a corporate management shakeup, naming new Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers. Founding member and removed CEO Rob Lowe retained a board seat.

Over its history Wellspring has secured millions of dollars in US government contracts and has a registered lobbying operation.
