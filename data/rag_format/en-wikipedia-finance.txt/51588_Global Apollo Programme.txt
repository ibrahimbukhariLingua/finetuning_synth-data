Global Apollo Programme


# Global Apollo Programme



The **Global Apollo Programme** was a historic call for a major global science and economics research programme to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025.


## Inspiration and aims

Launched in June 2015, the project - named for the Apollo Program, which brought together thousands of scientists and engineers to put mankind on the moon - calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP, for 10 years, to fund co-ordinated research to solve the challenge. This equates to $150 billion over a decade, roughly the same cost committed to the Apollo Program in 2015 money. Some developed nations, including the UK, already meet the GDP percentage target spend, but many do not and there is little international coordination to maximise the results.

It has been modelled on the more recent International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors, an international research collaborative that is credited with greatly and swiftly improving the quality and economics of semiconductor manufacture.


## Key areas of focus

* Renewable energy - in particular that derived from solar and wind sources
* Energy storage
* Smart grids
* hydrogen vehicles

## Key people


### Launch report authors

The initiative is spearheaded by the chemist Professor Sir David King, former Government Chief Scientific Adviser to HM Government. Amongst the Apollo group are economists Professor Lord Stern (author of The Stern Review) and Lord O'Donnell (former Cabinet Secretary), businessmen Lord Turner and Lord Browne (former Chief Executive of BP), cosmologist and astrophysicist Professor Lord Rees (former President of the Royal Society) and labour economist Lord Layard.


### Endorsers

* Professor John Shepherd, University of Southampton
* Dr Arunabha Ghosh, Founder-CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water

Professor Jeffrey Sachs, Professor of Sustainable Development and Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University has separately publicly endorsed the programme.

Professor Sir David King has publicly stated that Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi is "keen" on the programme.


## Reaction

> At last - an authoritative, practical and comprehensible plan that could avert the catastrophe that is threatening our planet.
> — Sir David Attenborough, *official launch at the Royal Society on 2 June 2015*

> [Research and development in renewables] should be like the Manhattan Project and the Apollo Project in the sense that the government should put in a serious amount of R&D.
> — Bill Gates, spearhead of Mission Innovation, 25 June 2015

> We will work together and with other interested countries to raise the overall coordination and transparency of clean energy research, development and demonstration... We ask our Energy Ministers to take forward these initiatives...
> — Leaders of the G7, 41st G7 summit, Schloss Elmau, June 2015

> Foremost, governments need to fund research and development for low-carbon energy technologies at Apollo-program levels of commitment... The required funding of this ultimate public good is too great a risk with too little a reward for private companies. But it is easily fundable by governments.
> — Professor Steven Pinker, Harvard University


## Key dates

* The programme was discussed at the Energy Ministers run-up meeting to the 41st G7 summit.
* It featured in the Leader's Declaration of the 41st G7 summit itself.
