Noregs Sildesalslag originated as an association of herring fishermen which was formed in 1936 with the merger of two fishing associations: Storsildlaget, which dated to 1926, and Stor- og Vårsildlaget, which dated from 1928. The first director of Noregs Sildesalslag was Mons A. Kårbø who served until 1951. Kårbø had previously been chairman and president of the sales board of Stor- og Vårsildlaget.

Norges Sildesalgslag is owned and operated by Norwegian fishermen. Norges Sildesalgslag has a central role in all sales which are carried out through electronic auction. Both Norwegian and foreign fishermen sell their fish through this association, which is open for bids from Norwegian and foreign buyers. The fishing fleet consists of 600 - 800 vessels.
