## Plot

Teresa works in mutual fund sales at a bank and is anxious about not making her sales quotas. Her failure to sell some mutual funds to loan shark Chung Yuen leaves her frustrated and fearful about getting fired for poor sales performance. Teresa eventually sells some mutual funds to Siu-kuen, an old senior who unfit for the risk profile of the funds.

Connie feels frustrated by her husband Ching-fong's reluctance to buy a condo. Connie approaches Teresa to inquire about criteria to qualify for a mortgage. On an impulse Connie commits to a mortgage for a condo purchase, but the condo price drops due to market volatility. She tries to back out of the purchase but is unable to do so. Eventually the property agent was able to find a buyer who offers her more than her purchase price.

Panther is overseeing the birthday banquet for his triad boss Lai Kwan. During the banquet, Ching-fong arrives to arrest Yiu-wah. Panther raises funds for bailing out Yiu-wah. Dragon helps Panther to bail out Yiu-wah, and in the process, invites Panther setup an account to trade the Hang Seng Futures market.
Dragon loses a lot of money in a Futures trade from an account that he borrowed from mob boss Mr. Sung. Dragon calls upon Panther to help him arrange for a loan from Chung Yuen. While going to pickup the $5 Million loan, Dragon is stabbed by Mr. Sung and eventually dies from the stab wound.

Teresa meets with Chung Yuen to hand over $10 Million in cash withdrawal as per his instructions. However, Dragon negotiates with Chung Yuen to borrow just $5 Million. In a rush to meet with Dragon to deliver the cash, Chung Yuen instructs to Teresa to deposit the remaining $5 Million back into his account but does not sign any deposit slip. On his way to meet with Dragon, Chung Yuen is attacked before Panther has a chance to rob him. Chung Yuen fights off the attacker but dies from his wounds. Panther collects the $5Million and uses it to place a bet on the Futures market in an attempt to recuperate Dragon's losses. The bet makes a lot of profit, but since Dragon has died, Panther keeps the winnings.

Teresa, upon seeing that Chung Yuen has died from his wounds, keeps the remaining $5Million and resigns from the bank.
