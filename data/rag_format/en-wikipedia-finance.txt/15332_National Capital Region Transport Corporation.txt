National Capital Region Transport Corporation


# National Capital Region Transport Corporation



The **National Capital Region Transport Corporation** (**NCRTC**) is a joint venture company of the Government of India and the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. The NCRTC is the owner of RapidX, the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project across the National Capital Region (NCR), inaugurated on 20 October 2023. It is operated by Deutsche Bahn.


## Establishment

The Union Cabinet approved formation of the NCRTC under the Companies Act, 1956, in July 2013. The NCRTC was charged with designing, developing, implementing, financing, operating, and maintaining the RRTS in the NCR to provide comfortable and fast transit to NCR towns and to meet the growth in demand for rapid transport options in the region. The NCRTC was incorporated on 21 August 2013, and Vinay Kumar Singh was appointed as its first managing director in July 2016. The NCRTC is authorized to form subsidiary companies to implement each of the corridors. Seed capital was to be contributed as follows:

| Government of India |
| --- |
| Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs | 22.5% |
| Ministry of Railways | 22.5% |
| National Capital Region Planning Board | 5.0% |

| State governments |
| --- |
| Government of NCT Delhi | 12.5% |
| Government of Uttar Pradesh | 12.5% |
| Government of Rajasthan | 12.5% |
| Government of Haryana | 12.5% |

Out of eight RRTS corridors identified and targeted for development prior to the formation of the NCRTC, the following four were prioritized for implementation by India's Planning Commission:

* Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut
* Delhi-Gurugram-SNB-Alwar
* Delhi-Panipat
* Ghaziabad–Jewar Regional Rapid Transit System

## Implementation

The RRTS currently proposed by the government will have a travel time of one hour for Delhi–Panipat and Delhi–Meerut, and two hours for Delhi–Alwar. This will result in facilitating seamless travel between the CBD and NCR suburbs. Recently, all state governments have approved alignments of the three Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridors. These corridors will connect the capital with Panipat, Meerut, and Alwar. These three alignments were recommended by the National Capital Regional Planning Board (NCRPB).

In its 36th meeting, held under the chairmanship of Union Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu, the NCRPB gave the nod to the implementation of three RRTS corridors—Delhi–Alwar, Delhi–Panipat, and Delhi–Meerut. Further, Minister Naidu stated that issues related to the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) have been resolved and further work on these three corridors could be started immediately. The minister also said that a managing director, entrusted with the implementation of the RRTS, had been appointed and implementation of the RRTS corridors will commence shortly. Indian Railways officer Shri. Vinay Kumar Singh has been appointed as the managing director of the company and assumed office in July 2016.
