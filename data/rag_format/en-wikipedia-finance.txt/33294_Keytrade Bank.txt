# Keytrade Bank



**Keytrade Bank** is a financial services company based in Belgium with a subsidiary in Luxembourg.


## History

VMS-Keytrade, Belgium's first online investment site, was found in 1998. In 2002, VMS-Keytrade became Keytrade Bank and acquired its banking status by taking over RealBank.

Between 2005 and 2016, Keytrade Bank was part of the Crelan Group, which until 2015 was 50% owned by the Crédit Agricole Group, one of Europe's largest groups (own funds of €64.8 billion and net profit of €6 billion).

Since June 2016, Keytrade Bank has been part of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa banking group.

## Marketing

Keytrade Bank provides the numbers used in the daily financial magazine *Cotes et Cours*, which is broadcast by the RTBF. This partnership allows Keytrade Bank to run a short spot advertising just before and after the magazine. This seems like a win-win marketing operation for both the RTBF and Keytrade Bank.

On 29 September 2014, KeytradeBank Belgium established a brand new visual identity: a new logo, website and advertising campaign have been announced.

It seems this new visual identity has not yet made its way to the Keytrade Bank subsidiaries: Keytrade Bank Nederland, Keytrade Bank Lux and Strateo (Switzerland).
