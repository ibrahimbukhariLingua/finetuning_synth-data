Electricity Forward Agreement


# Electricity Forward Agreement



**Electricity Forward Agreement (calendar)** (short: **EFA system**) is a calendar used to specify load profiles when trading on the electricity market. It was officially only valid until October 2014 but is still abundantly used among commodity traders.


## Features of the EFA calendar

One distinguishes between weekdays *WD* and weekend *WE* since the electricity consumption is clearly lower on Saturdays and Sundays.
An *EFA day* starts at 11pm local time and runs through 11pm the next (astronomical) day. An EFA-week *WK* consists of five *WD* and two *WE*-days.
An *EFA month* is defined differently than common months: March, June, September, and December have five weeks, while all other months are considered to have exactly four weeks. The two *EFA seasons* are winter (WK 40 – WK 13) and summer (WK 14 – WK 39), each having exactly 26 weeks. Due to the existence of leap years, some EFA-Decembers have six weeks (e.g. 2004 and 2009), a strong difference from the commonly used Gregorian calendar system, where February is the leap month.

The EFA day is composed of six blocks of 4 hours each. For each block, baseload products exist (i.e. WD 1/2/3/4/5/6 and WE 1/2/3/4/5/6). Peak load products only exist for *WD3*, *WD4*, and *WD5* (also on bank holidays), and consequently off-peak products are only available for the remaining EFA blocks of each week. Blocks 1 and 2 are usually termed *overnight blocks*; the other blocks are *day blocks*.
