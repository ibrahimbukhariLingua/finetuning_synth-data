# Maya (mobile payments)



**Maya** (formerly known as **PayMaya**), is a Filipino financial services and digital payments company based in Metro Manila, Philippines.


## History

The company was launched in December 2000 as Smart Money powered by Smart e-Money, Inc., in cooperation with 1st e-Bank (formerly PDCP Bank; now BDO Unibank) and Mastercard. It was claimed that it was the world’s first card linked to a wireless phone and was marketed by Smart Communications as one of the biggest innovations in finance.

In January 2016, the service was rebranded as PayMaya and, in the first quarter of the same year, reached the milestone of having processed $1 billion worth of transactions. PayMaya reached 44 million registered users by the end of 2021.

In April 2022, PLDT and Smart Communications, the two companies controlling PayMaya's parent company, Voyager Innovations, announced that PayMaya would be overhauled and renamed *Maya*, coinciding with the launch of Maya Bank. The said rebranding came to fruition on May 2, 2022.

In January 2025, a streaming network called BeetzePlay was introduced to be streamed only on Maya for short drama series on vertical mode and 2-3 minute runtimes similar to Tiktok's video style with the same duration.
