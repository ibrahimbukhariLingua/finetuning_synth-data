## Philanthropy

In 2011, Overdeck and his wife Laura established the Overdeck Family Foundation, an organization that funds educational research and STEM education. The foundation's overall goal is to enable all American children to unlock their potential by strengthening learning in and out of school.

The Overdecks' education philanthropy focuses on four key issue areas: "early impact", "exceptional educators", "innovative schools", and "inspired minds". They have made gifts to Robin Hood Foundation for work by MDRC to study the long-term effects of various early childhood programs. The Overdecks have also supported the Harlem Children's Zone within its early impact strategy and the Khan Academy. Other grantees have included the NJ STEM Teaching Fellowship, and Governor's School for the Sciences at Drew University in New Jersey. Laura Overdeck is an alumna of Governor's School and was instrumental in saving the program through private donations in 2006.

In October 2018, The Overdeck Education Innovation Fund gifted $1 million to be distributed over the next three years by the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs for research on education issues. This is the second gift from the Overdeck Family Foundation, the first of which was $1 million donated in 2016. That same month, the Overdeck Family Foundation pledged $3 million to Opportunity Insights, a policy and research institute based at Harvard University that will publish data on the probability that children will escape poverty based on where they were raised.
