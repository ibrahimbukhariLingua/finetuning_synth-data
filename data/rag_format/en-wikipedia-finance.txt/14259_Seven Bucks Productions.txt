## History

Seven Bucks Productions was founded in 2012 by actor Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia, Johnson's ex-wife and later manager. Its name is a reference to the amount of money Johnson had in his pocket after he was released from the CFL in 1995, before he signed with WWE in 1996 and became one of the most popular professional wrestlers of all time.

Johnson remains the CEO and owner alongside Garcia. In 2017, Garcia's brother Hiram was promoted to the company's president of production, overseeing each of its projects. Other figures include Chelsea Friedland as vice president of production since 2017, Kevin Hill as head of television and digital development since 2018, Maya Lasry as chief marketing officer since 2019, Kimberly Bialek as executive vice president of development and production since 2020, Scott Landsman as head of television since 2023, and Melissa Fried as vice president of film development and production since 2023.

In June 2024, Seven Bucks signed a first-look deal with The Walt Disney Company to develop and produce television series and films for theatrical and streaming.
