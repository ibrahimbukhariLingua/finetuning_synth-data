Proskauer Rose


# Proskauer Rose



**Proskauer Rose LLP** (formerly known as Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn, LLP) is an international law firm headquartered in New York City. Proskauer was founded in 1875 and currently employs more than 800 attorneys in eleven offices worldwide.

Proskauer is known for its litigation, labor & employment, corporate, private equity, private investment funds, finance, and intellectual property law departments. Proskauer has long been the primary outside law firm for the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL).


## History

Throughout its history, the firm's headquarters has been located in the area of Times Square, in midtown Manhattan, where it grew from fewer than a dozen lawyers originally to nearly 800. A full-service practice, it is currently among the ten largest law firms in New York City.

William R. Rose started the firm that is now Proskauer when, at 21 years of age, he opened a law firm on Broadway in Downtown Manhattan in 1875. In 1907, Rose promoted associate Benjamin Paskus to partner and renamed the firm Rose & Paskus. Rose & Paskus was one of the first firms to develop a specialized tax practice after the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913. In 1930, Judge Joseph M. Proskauer resigned his position on New York's Appellate Division to join the firm, which was then renamed Proskauer, Rose & Paskus. The firm shortened its name to Proskauer Rose in 1997.

Proskauer is not known as a traditional "white shoe" law firm, though over the past quarter-century it has gained the reputation as one of the "new white shoe" law firms. Thus it cannot rely on long-standing ties to old money or big investment banks. Rather, the firm has historically focused its practice on labor and employment law, as well as building up significant litigation, private capital, health care, sports and entertainment, bankruptcy, and taxation practices.


## Revenue and profitability

In February 2012, Proskauer increased its gross revenue by 6.4 percent to $686 million and its average profits per partner 9 percent to $1.7 million, according to The American Lawyer's reporting. In 2013, Proskauer again increased its revenue by more than 7%, to over $700 million. These figures place Proskauer as one of the fastest growing law firms in the United States. The firm's robust financial performance came amid a busy year for office moves. The most significant shuffle saw Proskauer move its New York headquarters to 11 Times Square in January, 2011. With more than 400,000 square feet of space spread across 14 floors, the firm is the new building's anchor tenant—with its name splashed across the facade in a 40-foot-by-10-foot backlit sign. Proskauer saw gross revenue of $1.23 billion in 2023, up from $990 million in 2020.


## Pro bono

In 2012, Proskauer argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in a ruling that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), which reduced the disparity in federal sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offenses, applies to defendants who were sentenced after its passage even though their offenses pre-dated the law. The firm is also noted for hosting an Election Protection call center during every election cycle since the 2012 Presidential election.

In 2010, Proskauer received the Law Firm Pro Bono Award at the William O. Douglas Award Dinner in Los Angeles, sponsored by Public Counsel, the United States' largest pro bono public interest law firm.

In 2019, Proskauer was named to The National Law Journal's "Pro Bono Hot List."
