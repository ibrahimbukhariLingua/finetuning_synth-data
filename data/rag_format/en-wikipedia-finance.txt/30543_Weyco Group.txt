## History

In 1964, after an estrangement with his father Harold Florsheim, son of company founder Milton S. Florsheim, Thomas Florsheim Sr. left the Florsheim Shoe Company and invested $750,000 in the Weyenberg Shoe Manufacturing Company, becoming partners with Frank Weyenberg. They acquired Nunn Bush and Stacy Adams, while developing the new Brass Boot line in Europe. When the Florsheim Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002, Weyco purchased some of the company's assets. Weyco acquired Umi in 2010, and in 2011 it acquired The Combs Company and its BOGS and Rafters footwear brands. Weyco is led by Thomas Florsheim Jr. (the great-grandson of Milton S. Florsheim).
