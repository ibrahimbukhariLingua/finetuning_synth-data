## History

The National Treasury Administration was originally established as **National Treasury Department** under the Ministry of Finance in the early years of the Republic of China. On 26 March 1940, the department was then upgraded to **National Treasury Administration** and the Organizational Act of the National Treasury Administration was promulgated on the same day. At that time, the administration consisted of 4 sections and 1 office. On 10 February 1942, the organizational act was amended and promulgated which resulted in the expansion of the administration to become 6 sections and 2 offices. On 22 July 1981, the organizational act was amended and promulgated again.
