## Career


### Research

Nigrini is best known for his work on using Benford's Law as an auditing and accounting tool to detect anomalies in company data.
He is the author of *Forensic Analytics* which describes data analytics tests designed to detect fraud, errors, estimates, and biases in financial data. He is also the author of *Benford's Law*. Benford's Law gives the expected patterns of the digits in tabulated data and it has been used by auditors and scientists to detect anomalies in tabulated data.

In August 2014 Nigrini published an article, *Lessons from an $8 million fraud*, with Nathan J. Mueller who stole $8.45 million from his employer, an insurance company, over a four-year period. In the article Mueller describes his fraud scheme, how he explained his newfound wealth in the form of expensive cars, watches, nightlife entertainment, and Las Vegas gambling trips, to his wife and friends, and ultimately how he was caught. Mueller served his sentence at Federal Prison Camp, Duluth, a minimum security federal prison. He was released on February 27, 2015. In the article Nigrini reviews the preventive and detective anti-fraud measures that could have detected the multimillion-dollar fraud four years before it was detected, and only by chance. Nigrini and Mueller won the Lawler Prize for the article in 2014.


### Journal editing and other work

Nigrini serves on the Executive Editorial Board of the *International Journal of Disclosure and Governance* and also of the *Journal of Forensic & Investigative Accounting*.

Nigrini has served as an expert witness and has done consulting engagements for large international organisations and government departments at the state level.
