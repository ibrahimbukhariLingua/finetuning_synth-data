Huntington Bank Tower


# Huntington Bank Tower



**Huntington Bank Tower** is a 20-story, 311-foot-tall (95 m) skyscraper in Detroit, Michigan. The building serves as the regional headquarters for Huntington National Bank. It is located at 2025 Woodward Avenue.


## History

Huntington Bank Tower was initially proposed in 2018 to replace a 10-story building and a surface parking lot. The development was planned to be the headquarters of Midland-based Chemical Bank, but the bank was involved in a series of mergers that led to the new entity, Huntington National Bank, establishing a headquarters in the building. Huntington Bank Tower contains ground-floor commercial space, ten floors of parking, and another nine floors of office space.

In June 2023, Florida-based The Herrick Company announced that they had purchased Huntington Bank Tower for $150 million.


## Construction

Huntington Bank Tower was designed by Neumann/Smith Architecture. The general contractor for the project was Detroit-based Brinker Group. Construction on Huntington Bank Tower began in 2019 and finished in September 2022.
