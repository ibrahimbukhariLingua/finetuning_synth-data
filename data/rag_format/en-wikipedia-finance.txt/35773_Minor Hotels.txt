## History

American-born Thai businessman William Heinecke founded the hotel group in 1978, with the opening of the Royal Garden Resort Pattaya as its inaugural venture. The property underwent rebranding over the years, initially becoming the Pattaya Marriott Resort & Spa, and is presently known as the Avani Pattaya Resort.

Minor Hotels entered the luxury hospitality market in 2001 with the opening of its first Anantara Hotels & Resorts in 2001 in Hua Hin. The brand celebrated its 20th anniversary in March 2021, now with a presence in over 40 properties across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, and Europe.

The hotel group began its expansion into Africa in 2008 by acquiring a 50 percent stake in Elewana Afrika, marking the company's first significant venture into the continent. In 2014, Minor Hotels further solidified its presence in Africa with investments in various properties, enhancing its portfolio in the region.

In 2011, Minor Hotels broadened its portfolio by acquiring Oaks Hotels, Resorts & Suites, a prominent hotel chain based in Australia. The acquisition resulted in Minor Hotels holding a majority stake of 54.3 percent in the hotel chain, extending its reach into the Australian hospitality market.

Minor Hotels expanded in Europe with the acquisition of Tivoli Hotels & Resorts in 2015. This acquisition included 16 properties across Portugal and Brazil, representing its first significant investment in Europe. The transaction was notable for being the largest hospitality deal in Portugal's history.

In 2017, Minor Hotels acquired a significant stake in Corbin & King, a hospitality group in the United Kingdom known for notable establishments like The Wolseley and The Delaunay. Furthering its investment, Minor Hotels successfully bid to acquire the entire Corbin & King business in April 2022. Subsequently, the group was rebranded as The Wolseley Hospitality Group.

Minor Hotels acquired the NH Hotel Group in 2018. This acquisition added approximately 380 hotels to its portfolio, significantly extending the hotel group's presence in Europe and Latin America.
