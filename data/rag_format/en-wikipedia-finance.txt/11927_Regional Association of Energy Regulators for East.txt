# Regional Association of Energy Regulators for Eastern and Southern Africa



The **Regional Association of Energy Regulators for Eastern and Southern Africa** (**RAERESA**) is a specialized agency of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.

RAERESAâ€™s primary objectives include:

* Harmonizing energy policies, legislation, and regulations across member states.
* Facilitating capacity-building programs for regulators and stakeholders.

**The Plenary**: The highest decision-making body comprising representatives from member states.

**The Executive Committee**: Responsible for overseeing the implementation of strategic initiatives.

**Portfolio Committees**: Focused on specific areas such as legal harmonization and capacity building.

**The Secretariat**: Led by the Chief Executive Officer, it handles daily operations and coordination.
