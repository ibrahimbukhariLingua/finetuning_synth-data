Accounting machine


# Accounting machine



An **accounting machine**, or **bookkeeping machine** or **recording-adder**, was generally a calculator and printer combination tailored for a specific commercial activity such as billing, payroll, or ledger. Accounting machines were widespread from the early 1900s to 1980s, but were rendered obsolete by the availability of low-cost computers such as the IBM PC.

This type of machine is generally distinct from unit record equipment (some unit record tabulating machines were also called "accounting machines").
