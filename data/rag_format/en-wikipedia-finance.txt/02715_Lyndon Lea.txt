**Lyndon Lea** (born 13 January 1969) is an English financier and investor, known for co-founding Lion Capital which specializes in making investments in the consumer sector. Notable previous and current consumer brands owned by Lion have included Weetabix, Jimmy Choo, Wagamama, Kettle Foods and AllSaints.


## Early life

Lea was born in Morecambe, Lancashire, England. His mother was a hairdresser and his father was an engineer who loved travel . Lea spent his childhood growing up in South Africa, Botswana and moved at aged 13 to Canada, where he became a citizen. In 1990, after graduating in business administration from the University of Western Ontario, his career started in the mergers and acquisitions department of Goldman Sachs in New York working primarily on consumer deals. He returned to London in 1992 and, after a brief spell in the investment-banking division of Schroders, he was recruited with Neil Richardson, to start the European affiliate (Glenisla) of industry giant KKR. In 1998 he was spotted by Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst and brought in to launch their new European business. At Hicks Muse he worked with consumer brands ranging from Mumm & Perrier-Jouet champagne brands to Typhoo tea and Branston Pickle. He also oversaw the flotations of Yell Group, the UK phone directories business, in 2003, and Premier Foods in 2004.


## Lion Capital

In 2004, Lea gained prominence by separating the European business he ran from its ailing American parent, Hicks Muse. Along with Robert Darwent, his Hicks Muse colleague, Lea co-founded Lion Capital and turned Lion Capital into one of the best-known firms in the investment business. Lea and Lion have invested in over 100 consumer brands in Europe and North America. The company currently employs 30 investment executives.
Lea is known for his hands-on investing style and his ownership of high-profile fashion brands such as Jimmy Choo, AllSaints and John Varvatos has made him a staple of the UK and New York press. Not all of Lion's investments have been successful. Notably, La Senza, which Lea admits was one of the riskier investments for Lion, was not successful.
