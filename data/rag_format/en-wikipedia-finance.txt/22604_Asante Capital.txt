## Business Verticals

Asante Capital Group is active across three verticals:

Clients vary from less established managers to some of the oldest and most established multi-vertical investment platforms globally. As of 2021, Asante has raised over $40 billion for 70 funds across 45 fund managers.
* **Secondaries Advisory** - supporting both General Partners and Limited Partners with liquidity solutions. Types of deals include both GP-led and LP-led transactions and Asante has advised on multiple continuation vehicle fund restructurings, LP stake sales, tender processes, bridge funds and seasoned primaries. As of 2021, Asante has advised on over $5 billion worth of secondaries transactions.
* **Direct Investment Transactions** - partnering with fundless sponsors to finance investments on a deal-by-deal basis. This vertical provides creative capital raising and structuring solutions, as well as tailored advisory beyond the traditional fundraising remit. As of 2021, Asante has completed over $2.5 billion of direct transaction sales.

## Competitors

The placement agent landscape is a competitive environment, with many firms providing private equity advisory services to managers across the spectrum. A few placement agents are structured as groups within larger investment banking firms, though a number, like Asante, operate as independent advisors. Notable competitors include Campbell Luytens, Evercore, Lazard, Credit Suisse, PJT Partners, Rede Partners, and UBS.
