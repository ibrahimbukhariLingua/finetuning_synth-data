## History of Yadkin Bank

The original bank was opened in 1968. However, in three years Yadkin Valley Bank grew significantly by the acquisition of two other regional banks (Main Street Bankshares, Inc. in June 2002, operating as "Piedmont Bank", and High Country Financial Corporation in January 2004, operating as "High Country Bank") and a mortgage broker (Sidus Financial LLC in October 2004), as well as opening new branch locations. Piedmont Bank and High Country Bank were reorganized as divisions of Yadkin Valley Bank but maintained their names and logos. Sidus remained as a wholly owned subsidiary.

Yadkin Valley Bank and its divisions operated 23 full-service branch locations. As of December 31, 2005, the company achieved a milestone in the bank's history by reaching the US$1 billion mark in total assets for the first time.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On July 1, 2006, the company reorganized into a holding company, becoming Yadkin Valley Financial Corporation.

Yadkin Valley Bank announced in June 2007 that it was buying Cardinal State Bank of Durham, North Carolina. The purchase is the bank's first entry into the Triangle market. The completion of the deal gave Yadkin Valley 28 branches in 11 North Carolina counties.

Yadkin Valley Bank acquired American Community Bank of Monroe, North Carolina, in 2009.

As of May 28, 2013, all of the banks Yadkin Valley had acquired would have one name, Yadkin Bank. The holding company also changed names to Yadkin Financial Corporation. With $1.9 billion in assets and 36 branches, Yadkin Valley Bank would become Yadkin Bank and its NASDAQ symbol would change from YAVY to YDKN.

On October 5, 2011, it was announced that Piedmont would buy VantageSouth, which had two branches in Burlington, $91 million in assets and $73 million in deposits, and that the company would take the name VantageSouth.

On October 24, 2011, Piedmont announced it would acquire a controlling interest in Cary, North Carolina–based Crescent Financial Bancshares, parent of Crescent State Bank. Abram would become Crescent chairman, and Piedmont president and former RBC Bank CEO Scott Custer would be Crescent CEO.

In August 2012, Crescent announced a merger with VantageSouth, which had five branches and $260.7 million in assets as of September 30 and was called by Custer "one of the most profitable banks in North Carolina." On December 3, the fifteen Crescent branches took the VantageSouth name. Custer became CEO and VantageSouth CEO Steve Jones became president.

On September 25, 2012, Crescent and Engelhard, North Carolina–based East Carolina Bank, with 25 branches, announced their merger. Once the East Carolina deal was completed, VantageSouth had 45 branches in central and eastern North Carolina and $2 billion in assets.
