# Mirabelle Muûls



**Mirabelle Muûls** is a Belgian economist who is professor and co-director of the Hitachi-Imperial Centre for Decarbonisation and Natural Climate Solutions at Imperial College London. Her research considers the economic implications of climate change.


## Early life and education

Muûls studied economics at Saint-Louis University, Brussels and UCLouvain. She moved to the London School of Economics for graduate studies, where she worked on the politics of global economies. Her doctorate explored the interactions governments and corporations in climate change.


## Research and career

In 2008, Muûls joined the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. Here she was awarded an Imperial College Research Fellowship, where she started working with the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy. At Imperial, Muûls started a new teaching programme on Climate Change, Management and Finance.

Muûls serves as an associate professor at the Imperial College Business School. She serves as co-director of the Hitachi-Imperial Centre for Decarbonisation and Natural Climate Solutions. Her research looks to understand the economics of climate change. She has studied the energy demands of households, and how they respond to incentives (e.g. smart meters), as well as the interaction between governments, companies and the public during the climate catastrophe. She has studied whether dynamic pricing could be used to increase the proportion of renewable energy in the electricity grid. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) can be used to understand the power distribution network, helping countries manage electricity and adopt more sustainable energy solutions.

Muûls has studied whether carbon markets could help to alleviate climate change. She showed that creating the European carbon market reduced emissions by approximately 5.4 million tonnes of carbon each year. The introduction of carbon markets inspired companies to invest in clean technologies, and discouraged them from polluting industry.
