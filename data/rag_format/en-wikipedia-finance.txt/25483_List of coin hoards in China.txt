List of coin hoards in China


# List of coin hoards in China



The **list of coin hoards in China** (traditional Chinese: 中國錢幣窖藏清單; simplified Chinese: 中国钱币窖藏列表; pinyin: *zhōng guó qián bì jiào cáng liè biǎo*) lists significant archaeological hoards of coins, other types of coinages (e.g. sycees) or objects related to coins discovered in China (the People's Republic of China in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and the Free area of the Republic of China, e.g. Taiwan). The history of Chinese currency dates back as early as the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE), and the earliest coinages took the form of imitations of the cowrie shells that were used in ceremonial exchanges. During the Warring States period new forms of currency such as the spade money, knife money, and round copper-alloy coins were introduced (further reading: Zhou dynasty coinage and Ancient Chinese coinage). After unification of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC the Ban Liang (半兩) cash coin became the standard coinage, under the Han dynasty the Wu Zhu (五銖) cash coins became the main currency of China until they were replaced with the Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寳) during the Tang dynasty, after which a large number of inscriptions were used on Chinese coinages. During the late nineteenth century China started producing its own machine-struck coinages.

In Chinese culture coins are often used as burial objects and it's not uncommon for coins to be discovered in tombs and graves.

Occasionally foreign coins are also found in China, which were brought there through international trade routes such as the Silk Road, overseas trade with foreign countries, and colonialism. And because of trade with other countries large quantities of Chinese coins have also been found in neighbouring countries like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, as well as far away places like Elcho Island, Kenya, and Yukon.

In 2021 a paper was published about an old mint that was discovered at an archeological site in Henan Province, through radiocarbon-dating the spade money found there was attributed to have been created between 640 BCE and no later than 550 BCE making it possibly the world's oldest known mint. This means that it is possible that the earliest known coinage was invented by the Chinese and not the Lydians as is commonly believed.


## Cleaning of coins by Chinese archaeologists

As Chinese archaeologists frequently unearth ancient Chinese cash coins and other forms of historical currency at tomb sites, these unearthed bronze coinages are often severely corroded because they have been buried for hundreds or thousands of years, this sometimes means that the inscriptions on them can't be read. While archaeologists working at a site tend to do everything very slowly and do it as methodically as possible to avoid doing any damage to the buried cultural relics, this approach isn't taken with cash coins because they are often vital to date the tombs or ruins. With ancient Chinese cash coins archaeologists tend to be less concerned about their preservation and clean them to identify them.

To clean bronze cash coins Chinese archaeologists will simply put them in a mild acid like vinegar to soak for a period of 2 or 3 days, after this process is done the surface dirt and some of the corrosion will be removed. The cash coins are then removed by the person doing the cleaning, and they will them scrape out any leftover corrosion in the Chinese characters by using a (common) toothpick. After this process is done, a rubbing is usually made of the unearthed coins.

On the contrary, it is usually said among coin collectors to not clean their coins because the cleaning process will often lessen the coin's market value or in some cases even ruin it.

Because of the high frequency of the discovery of coin hoards in China uncleaned coin hoards from other countries are frequently send to China for cleaning and assessment. For example, someone discovered a hoard of group of around 400 different 8 reales coins on the border between Mexico and the central American country of Guatemala. These silver coins were mostly produced by the Guatemala mint with others produced by the Mexico and Lima mints, all of which contained portraits of kings Charles IV and Ferdinand VII. As these coins were all too unclean to be deemed "valuable" by coin collectors they were sent to a coin dealer in the Jiangsu, People's Republic of China. Such situations are common as Chinese coin dealers have become experts in removing corrosion from coins to get them graded by numismatic experts and then be sold into the retail market.

| 1820s | Ling-shih-hsien District, Shanxi Province | 16 Roman coins. | On 8 May 1886 the *Deseret News* reported: "Dr. Bushell of the British Legation at Peking, has prepared a monograph on some ancient Roman coins found in Shansi. The coins, 16 in number, were discovered, some 60 years ago, buried in the ground in the district of Ling-shih-hsien: it is known that there was constant intercourse and trade between China and the Roman empire during the first three centuries of the Christian era, and the coins, as identified by Dr. Bushell, date from Tiberius (A. D. 14-37) to Aurelianus (A. D. 270-275). Dr. Bushell says that he has heard of only one other instance of the discovery of Roman coins in China. That was when two were bought by Mr. Lyall at a wayside stall in Tien-Tsin, the Shansi coins presented "every appearance of having been buried, and no attempt had been made to remove the patina to read the legends." Dr. Bushell pronounces them genuine beyond all question, and says that he doubts whether "one of the best modern engravers, with all the appliances at his command, could produce a head equal to that on the coin of Commodus" (A. D. 180-192)." |

| The early 1970s | Chengtian Temple, Quanzhou, Fujian | Yonglong Tongbao (永隆通寶) clay moulds | During the early 1970s a number of Yonglong Tongbao (永隆通寶) clay moulds (traditional Chinese: 錢陶範; simplified Chinese: 钱陶范; pinyin: *Qián táo fàn*) were uncovered at the Chengtian Temple in Quanzhou, Fujian. The clay moulds date to the Kingdom of Min during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and all display the inscription Yonglong Tongbao. The clay moulds were discovered by a group of Buddhist monks digging in the courtyard in, to bury jars of a local Quanzhou-based traditional Chinese medicine known as "golden juice" (Chinese: 金汁; pinyin: *jīn zhī*), the elixir is made by mixing together the excrements of young (preadolescent) boys, spring water and "red soil" (traditional Chinese: 紅土; simplified Chinese: 红土; pinyin: *hóng tǔ*). After being prepared the solution is then stored inside a clay jar which is buried underground at a depth of approximately 3 meters. The clay jars are then left underground for a period of between 30 and 40 years, after which they are dug back up. "golden juice" as a form of "medicine" is taken orally and within traditional Chinese medicine it is considered to be particularly useful in the treatment of high fevers. While the initial clay moulds were uncovered during the early 1970s, it wasn't until the year 2002 when archeologists would formally excavate the site looking for more coin moulds. Yonglong Tongbao cash coins themselves today are very rare. There are only two specimens of them known to exist in Chinese museums and perhaps only about 100 specimens of Yonglong Tongbao cash coins are known to be in the hands of private Chinese coin collectors. Cash coins with this inscriptions were mostly made from iron, while an even smaller number of lead variants of them are known to exist. The reason as to why Yonglong Tongbao cash coins are so scarce has to do with the short period of time they were cast, which was only 1 year and 7 months. Furthermore they are even rarer because of the facts that iron suffers from oxidation and deteriorates, the limited area in which the Yonglong Tongbao cash coins had circulated, and their intricate method of production. | Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period |

These cash coins did not show any indication that the holes were modified by force at some time after their casting meaning that these abnormal shapes were not made after the production but during. |
| 5–12 May 1987 | Famen Temple, Famen town, Fufeng County, Shaanxi | 2,499 treasures from the Tang dynasty including gems, jewelry, art pieces, gold and silver utensils, and numerous silk fabrics woven with gold thread. This fine included more than 27,000 coins, mostly consisting of Tang dynasty period Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶) and Qianyuan Zhongbao (乾元重寶) cash coins, including 13 Kaiyuan Tongbao turtle shell coins (traditional Chinese: 玳瑁幣; simplified Chinese: 玳瑁币; pinyin: *Dàimào bì*). | In 1987, during a renovation of the Famen Temple, a previously undiscovered underground "palace" was discovered under the foundation of the pagoda, this underground complex contained an intact and secret vaunt that had remained untouched by grave robbers and looters. The renovation took place after a large part of the pagoda collapsed due to heave rains in 1981, when the renovation started 6 years later the foundation of the wooden pagoda dating to the Tang dynasty period was discovered underneath the foundation of the damaged brick pagoda. This discovery included many different treasures including the middle finger bone of the Buddha’s left hand. This discovery did not come as a complete surprise, however, because historical documents clearly recorded that this "true relic" (traditional Chinese: 靈骨; simplified Chinese: 灵骨; pinyin: *Líng gǔ*) that was kept at the Famen Temple during the Tang period. Many of the other cultural relics found in the underground palace date to the year 874 CE, which was the date when the chamber door was last reported to have been closed. Meaning that the underground palace remained hidden for 1,113 years. Among these finds there were over 27,000 cash coins dated to the Tang dynasty and 13 turtle shell cash coins made from Hawksbill sea turtle shell. These cash coins are the first turtle shell coins discovered in China and these may also be the oldest coins made of turtle shell ever found anywhere in the world. Because they all have the inscription "Kaiyuan Tongbao", they are dated to the Tang dynasty period alongside the rest or the discovered found treasures. As there is no mention of turtle shell coins being produced in any Tang dynasty historical texts, little else is known of their actual origin. | 874 CE | Famen Temple Cultural Scenic Area (法门寺文化景区). |

| May 20, 2000 | Cangzhou, Hebei | 48 tonnes of iron cash coins. | In a report by the People's Daily dated May 20, 2000, another hoard of iron cash coins was found in a field near Cangzhou, Hebei, at the same location as in 1997. The iron cash coins dated to the Northern Song dynasty period. The discovery was made by a local tourism department of Cangzhou city. The archeologists had initially dug up about 48 tonnes of iron cash coins, with the largest single chunk them weighing about 7 tonnes. The hoard was a breakthrough because never before were any iron cash coins discovered in northern China. Before this hoard, historians believed that iron cash coins were only used in regions where commerce flourished south of the Yangtze River. The archaeologists also found out that the Northern Song iron cash coins at the site had not simply rusted together but displayed clear signs that they had been melted together. Furthermore, at the site the archeologists also found some coin moulds and stoves that may suggest that a mint may have been located there in the past. However, some experts refuted this hypothesis because this area was part of a frontier region during the Song dynasty period and the Song government would in all likelihood not have built a coin mint in a remote border area like this. Contemporary experts noted that this coin hoard would re-write China's history of coin production. Why such a large quantity of Song dynasty period iron cash coins were buried in the area near Cangzhou and why these iron coins had apparently been melted together in such large chunks remains a mystery. According to Ms. Wang Yufang (王玉芳), the Director of the Cangzhou City Bureau of Cultural Relics (沧州市文物局), there are no historical documents dating to the Song dynasty that mention the existence of this iron cash coin cache. The most plausible hypothesis as to why these iron cash coins were located in such large quantities and why they were (partially) melted together claims that iron cash coins were sent to the area by the government of the Song dynasty to pay for military expenses contending for control of the Sixteen Prefectures against the Jurchens. The Song army was eventually defeated during this campaign. As they were forced to withdraw from the region, the Song army was faced with the prospect of having to transport such an enormous quantity of iron cash coins during their retreat. Since the transport of the iron cash coins would have been difficult to achieve, and given the fact that it was necessary them to make a hasty retreat, it is hypothesised that a decision was made by the Song army to abandon the huge amounts of money in the area, and that they were partially melted down to prevent the iron cash coinage from falling into the hands of the advancing enemy soldiers. The iron cash coins from the hoard are now displayed at the Tieqian Ku (铁钱库, "iron cash coins treasury") located in the city of Cangzhou. | Song dynasty period | The Tieqian Ku |

| April 2002 | Chengtian Temple, Quanzhou, Fujian | Yonglong Tongbao (永隆通寶) clay moulds | In April 2002 archeologists had begun a formal excavation at the Chengtian Temple in Quanzhou, Fujian, where three decades earlier a number of Kingdom of Min period Yonglong Tongbao (永隆通寶) clay moulds had been uncovered. At a depth of about 3 meters the archeologists had discovered over a thousand clay mould fragments at the location. While it known that the Min Kingdom had a mint, its exact location was unknown, but due to the discovery of such a large number of clay mould fragments discovered at the Chengtian Temple confirms that the mint was located somewhere in present-day Quanzhou, making it only known mint location from the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period at the time. The archaeologists considered this hoard to be particularly fortunate, as it is rare for such cultural objects made from clay to survive in climates that receive over 1200 millimeters of rain annually such as Quanzhou. This fact is cited to be one of the important reasons as to why no other sites which cast cash coins using clay moulds have been discovered in the modern period this far into southern China. Iron was used to cast cash coins by the Min Kingdom in the area because the region where Quanzhou is situated had ample supplies of iron and coal but lacked any copper reserves. As to why such a large quantity of clay moulds were discovered at the Chengtian Temple us because the casting method that was employed by the Min Kingdom at the time required a two-piece clay mould was made with a small hole in which the molten iron, with a temperature of at least 1535 °C, could be poured into them. Once the iron had hardened, forming the cash coin, the clay mould had to be broken apart to take the cash coin out. Each clay mould could was only capable to produce a single cash coin. Furthermore, the archaeologists noted that while the casting technique for manufacturing cash coins had remained the same as it had in ancient times, the casting technology itself had evolved to the point where the Chinese character inscriptions displayed on the coinage could now be clearly cast. | Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period |

In the distant past, a temple was situated on the site at the river. The temple was later destroyed at an undisclosed time but the cash coins unearthed at the site may be linked to the ancient temple that once stood there. | Song dynasty period |
| 2007 | Shaanxi province | A silver *Bai Jin San Pin* (白金三品) coin with a horse pattern produced during the Han dynasty period. | In 2007 a silver *Bai Jin San Pin* (白金三品) coin with a horse pattern was discovered in the Shaanxi province. This find was notably the first silver *Bai Jin San Pin* that was ever found. Up until this point the only *Bai Jin San Pin* that were ever discovered were made of lead, these were initially found during the 1980s and confused numismatists because historical texts, such as the *Records of the Grand Historian* very clearly noted that these coins were made from a silver-tin alloy. This discovery proved the validity of the reported silver coins from the reign of Emperor Wu of Han. The horse *Bai Jin San Pin* is the second coin of the set mentioned in the records and is square in shape, weighs 6 taels, and had a nominal value of 500 Ban Liang and Wu Zhu cash coins. The image of the horse represented the square earth. The description of the horse states that it has its "head upright, chest high, with three legs on the ground and one hoof raised, full of vigor and imposing momentum". The "square" horse *Bai Jin San Pin* coin together with the "round" dragon coin from the same series reflected the ancient Chinese theory of the “circle and square” where heaven (*Tian*) is represented by a circle and the flat earth (*Di*) by a square. | 119–115 BC |
| August 23, 2007 | Qianwanhu Village, Changzi County, Shanxi | 1.5 tonnes of Chinese cash coins dating from the Han to the Northern Song dynasty. | On August 23, 2007, a villager digging a channel to place pipes for tap water had found "money cellar" 1.5 meters containing 1.5 tonnes of ancient coins below the ground in Qianwanhu Village, Changzi County, Shanxi. According to Li Lin, an official of the Changzi Center of Cultural Heritage and Tourism, the "money cellar" contains around 10,000 coins and that they were piled orderly into a cuboid of 1.3-meter in length, 0.65-meter in width, and 1 meter in height. After they had been found, the cash coins were sent to the local authorities in charge of cultural relics. The reason as to why the cash coins were located there isn't known, but the archaeologists had made 3 hypotheses. The first hypothesis assumes that the cash coins were the private wealth of a landlord, the second hypothesis assumes that the cash coins from the "money cellar" were owned by ancient Chinese private banks who buried them during a war, while the third hypothesis assumes that the cash coins had belonged to rich people in the same scenario as the second hypothesis. The cash coins that were found are mostly from the Northern Song dynasty period, with some Han and Tang dynasty specimens being among them. Many of the unearthed cash coins are in good condition with readable characters, while others had been severely corroded. Li Lin noted that the largest cash coin found in the hoard is 3 centimeters in diameter and that the smallest is only 1 centimeter in diameter. | Northern Song dynasty period |

Zhao Aiguo, director of the Liquan County heritage and tourism bureau, stated that the coin hoard was accidentally discovered during the construction of the school's playground. The construction workers stumbled upon the coin hoard at around 11:30 AM on Tuesday June 9, 2009. The construction crew then proceeded to report the discovery of the cache to both the local heritage authority and the local police, after which the construction was halted to allow for the excavation. Following the arrival of local archaeologists and technicians the construction crew helped to collect the unearthed cash coins which were then placed in 170 bags, the bags were so numerous that they completely filled a lorry. The pit was constructed using blue bricks and the cash coins were kept in a 1.5 square meter pit which was about a meter high. The archaeologists noted that the site was a part of the now destroyed Xiangjici Temple constructed during the reign of the Western Han dynasty period Emperor Wen as a memorial for his late mother. Zhao Aiguo noted that there still is an extant tower, initially constructed in the year 834 during the Tang dynasty period, is located next to the primary school. Zhao Aiguo speculated that the cash coins were likely donated by people who visited the Xiangjici Temple and that the uncovered hole was an underground storage area for keeping the money. According to Zhao Aiguo the inscriptions on the cash coins date to the Tang, Song, and Mongol Yuan dynasties. | Yuan dynasty period |

| November 27, 2010 | Jiangyan, Jiangsu | 432 Chinese cash coins. | On November 27, 2010, it was reported by the *People's Daily Online* a number of cash coins dating the Tang and Song dynasties including a rare silver coin with a hexagonal hole, were discovered at a construction site located in Jiangyan, Jiangsu. The site was immediately visited by archaeologist Chen Wei and Dou Yaping, the director of the Cultural Heritage Division of the Jiangyan Municipal Bureau of Culture, Radio, television, Press and Publication. On November 29 the team had found a total of 432 cash coins of which most were still in good condition, there were 56 different variants with a total of 25 different era names (or reign titles). The diameters of the unearthed coins range from 2.2 zm to 2.5 cm, and their thickness is between 0.5 mm and 1 mm. Most of them tend to have square holes with a side length of around 5 mm in the centre. Of these cash coins, 21 were from the Tang dynasty period with the inscription Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶, 621–846), while 411 were from the Song dynasty period with inscriptions such as Xiangfu Yuanbao (祥符元寶, 1008–1016) and Xining Yuanbao (熙寧元寶, 1068–1077). Furthermore, among these coins is a silver coin that has been slightly damaged with an illegible inscription and another cash coin with a hexagonal centre hole, Dou Yaping stated that cash coins with hexagonal centre holes are known as "Guijia Chuan", which is one subtype of the "Huachuan Kong" cash coins.

| 2011 | Shaanxi province | A silver *Bai Jin San Pin* (白金三品) coin with a horse pattern produced during the Han dynasty period. | In 2011 a silver *Bai Jin San Pin* (白金三品) coin with a horse pattern was discovered in the Shaanxi province. This was the second time that a silver *Bai Jin San Pin* was found and the second one with a horse pattern. | 119–115 BC |
| June 4, 2011 | Suzhou, Jiangsu | 200,000 Northern Song dynasty period cash coins. | On June 4, 2011, it was reported by the Xinhua News Agency that a large coin hoard had been uncovered in Suzhou, Jiangsu. The coin hoard consisted of approximately 200,000 Northern Song dynasty period cash coins. The cash coins were discovered by a construction crew building a road on Wednesday June 1, 2011, while opening up an old well. The construction workers quickly stopped there work quickly after they had realised that what they had stumbled across was different from what they would more usually encounter during their work. The opening to the well wasn't round but eight-sided and it was located approximately 4 to 5 meters below the surface. After the construction crew dug a bit deeper they found a large quantity of ancient Chinese cash coins located inside the well. The construction company immediately notified the Suzhou Archaeology Research Bureau, who sent a team of 8 archeologists to excavate the cash coin hoard. It took a full day of digging by the archaeologists to dig up all the coins. The dispatched team had been able to recover over eighty bags of cash coins, each weighing around 50 kg, weighing around 4 tonnes together. Mr. Zhang Tiejun (张铁军), the assistant to the president of the Suzhou Archaeology Research Bureau noted that the coin hoard was divided into two layers, where the top was organised while the bottom layer wasn't as much. Furthermore common jugs were found at the bottom of the well which indicated that it was a normal water well. The inscriptions of the cash coins located in the top layer were mostly Chongning Zhongbao (崇寧重寶) and were largely bigger coins, while the bottom layer consisted mostly of Yuanfeng Tongbao (元豐通寶) and Shaosheng Yuanbao (紹聖元寶) cash coins. Among the hoard was also a silver Shaosheng Yuanbao cash coin. Zhang Tiejun speculated that the cash coins were likely hidden in the well by a business man who was afraid of losing his wealth during a war. Because the hoard mostly consisted of bronze cash coins, Zhang Tiejun believed that the cash coins weren't hidden by a "rich and influential family", as they would usually own silver and gold reserves. Zhang Tiejun speculated that the cash coins were buried in a hurry for safekeeping during a Jurchen invasion of Suzhou when the city had turned into a war zone, as the coins were haphazardly placed together and the fact that the well served as an actual well before. | Jin–Song Wars |
| June 15, 2011 | Guangzhou, Guangdong | Over a thousand Xin dynasty period cash coins with the inscription Daquan Wushi (大泉五十). | On June 15, 2011, it was reported that the Guangzhou Cultural Relics Archaeological Research Institute had unearthed a pile of one thousand cash coins while excavating an Eastern Han dynasty period grave in Guangzhou, Guangdong. The discovered cash coins are all Xin dynasty period cash coins with the inscription Daquan Wushi (大泉五十). The Eastern Han dynasty grave is 8.2 meters in length and 5.02 meters in width. Other than the cash coins, the archeologists had also discovered nearly a hundred other objects inside of the grave including a bronze mirror, pottery, coloured tile, as well as different types of ornaments and jewelry made of jade and agate. | Eastern Han dynasty period |
| July 6, 2011 | Longhai Village, Fujian | A large number of Spanish dollars. | According to a report published on July 6, 2011, a large number of chop marked silver Spanish dollars were discovered buried inside of a dirt pile in Longhai Village, Fujian. The dirt pile came from the digging of a foundation for a new house by a Mr. Huang (黃), who had been dumped the dirt on the vacant lot four days prior to the discovery of the Spanish dollars by an unnamed villager, who noticed a shiny object. News of the discovery then proceeded to spread quickly, which set off a "digging frenzy" resulting in around a hundred villagers appearing at the site with hoes, shovels, and basins to look for more Spanish dollars in two piles of dirt, measuring about 20 square meters. Reportedly, several hundred silver Spanish dollars were unearthed, and when the police finally arrived most of the villagers had run the scene. According to a villager the oldest Spanish dollar found that morning was dated 1775 while the most recent coin being found was minted in 1802. It was noted by two experts with the Zhangzhou City Collections Society that the Spanish silver dollars came into the area because of foreign trade that had occurred there during the middle of the Qing dynasty period. Spanish silver dollars are frequently found in Longhai Village and residents gave them the nickname "funny face coins". | Mid-Qing dynasty period |
| August 4, 2011 | Cang County, Hebei | A string of iron cash coins. | It was reported on August 4, 2011, by the Xinhua News Agency that a string of iron cash coins dating to the Song dynasty had been found in Cang County, Hebei. The unearthed site in Cangxian was later found to have sat on the relics of what was likely a local government administration, because of this the archaeologists believe that the iron can coins were once stored by the government as a form of reserve money. According to Wang Minzhi, a local researcher, if the assumptions were proven to be true, this excavation and its findings would challenge the common consensus that the iron cash coins were exclusively produced and used in southern China at that time. | Song dynasty period |
| August 24, 2011 | Inner Mongolia | 200 Tang and Song dynasty era cash coins. | It was reported on August 24, 2011, by the Xinhua News Agency that over 200 cash coins were unearthed in Inner Mongolia. The cash coins have inscriptions that were used during the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty periods and were covered with verdigris, with the majority of them being produced during the Northern Song dynasty. The coin hoard dated from a time when the area belonged to the Tangut Western Xia Empire. According to Zhang Zhenzhou of the Araxan Museum noted that the cash coins were probably buried there by desperate people during a war who wanted to hide their wealth from enemy soldiers. | Northern Song dynasty period | The Araxan Museum |
| Spring of 2010 (initial discovery) September 2011 (excavation) | Liaoyang, Liaoning | 2,200 Later Jin dynasty period cash coins | It was reported on September 14, 2011, by Liaoning Daily (辽宁日报) that the police had arrested a gang of three men who were allegedly thieves that had unearthed around 2,200 cash coins from the Jurchen (or Manchu) Later Jin dynasty period in Liaoyang, Liaoning. The Bureau of Public Security of Liaoyang City stated that the gang was under the leadership of a name referred to as Mr. Wu, a 32-year-old who was a former taxi driver, was informed that some ancient Chinese cash coins had been discovered at a construction site during spring of 2010. For a year he would go to the construction site with a shovel and managed to unearth approximately 300 cash coins. In May 2011 Mr. Wu had purchased a metal detector and he rented a large excavator to find more cash coins. Afterwards Mr. Wu had recruited a "treasure digging team", together they had been able to discover over 2,200 Later Jin dynasty period cash coins weighing 17 kilograms (37.4 pounds). After the find, Mr. Wu sold the coins for $101,700 (or 650,000 yuan). Later the person who had purchased these cash coins was arrested and told the police from whom he had acquired the coins. All of the Later Jin cash coins found at the site had inscriptions that were written in Manchu script. According to some local cultural relics experts these cash coins were a special issue that weren't meant to be circulated as money. It has been speculated by these experts that these cash coins were issued under Nurhachi to be awarded to military generals for their meritorious achievements. As these cash coins are extremely rare, it is speculated that the market value of this coin hoard would be $470,000 (¥3,000,000) at a minimum. | Later Jin dynasty period (1616–1636) |
| October 2011 | Cangzhou, Hebei | Several tonnes of iron cash coins. | In October 2011 it was reported that another pile of iron cash coins was unearthed in Cangzhou, Hebei. Based on preliminary calculations, the pile of iron cash coins fill an area that is about 25 m by 16 m. The top of the iron can coin pile is about 0.4 to 0.5 meters below the surface level. At the time of the initial discovery experts estimated that there were several tons of iron cash coins in the discovered pile. According to Mr. Yang Fengling (杨凤岭), the Director of the Cang Prefecture Cultural Relics Institute, it is not yet known if there is any connection between the newly discovered pile of iron cash coins and those that were discovered nearby in 1997. | Song dynasty period |
| October 27, 2011 | Suqian, Jiangsu | A silver dollar (*yuan*) depicting Yuan Shikai. | In an October 27, 2011, news report, the Suqian Evening News (宿迁晚报) noted that a silver coin bearing the image of Yuan Shikai had been discovered by Chinese archeologists inside of a coffin in Suqian, Jiangsu. The archeologists were excavating tombs in an area where most of the tombs date back to the Han dynasty period, but the fact that this tomb contains a 20th-century silver coin is evidence that the tomb where it was discovered (No. 4 Tomb) is a more recent one. While the casket did it include the coin, it did not include any corpse. The archeologists working at the site speculated that the "No. 4 Tomb" might have been a cenotaph (traditional Chinese: 衣冠塚; simplified Chinese: 衣冠冢; pinyin: *yī guān zhǒng*). A village elder alternatively speculated that the tomb may have been empty because of a local Suqian custom where the relatives of the deceased would have exhumed the corpse to have it reburied somewhere else. | Between 1912 and 1949 |
| October 27, 2011 | Rufu Stone Pagoda (儒符石塔), Haikou, Hainan | 70 Taiping Tongbao (太平通寶) cash coins. | In a report by the Haikou Evening News (海口晚报) published on October 27, 2011, it was revealed that Chinese archaeologists had uncovered a number of Northern Song dynasty period cash coins while working at a restoration of the Rufu Stone Pagoda (儒符石塔) built from volcanic rock near Haikou, Hainan. Up until that point it was difficult to determine when the Rufu Stone Pagoda had been built as the oldest historical records that mention the building date back to the Ming dynasty, but it was suspected prior to this discovery that the Rufu Stone Pagoda may have been constructed sometime during the late Song Dynasty, but there was no evidence that supported this hypothesis. During the renovation a worker had found a stone tortoise-shaped box, inside of this box were over 70 bronze Northern Song dynasty period Taiping Tongbao (太平通寶) cash coins which were produced from 976 until 989. Mr. Wang Daxin (王大新), the Director of the Haikou City Bureau of Cultural Relics (海口市文物局), noted that the thread that was used to bind the cash coins together had still been partially preserved. Furthermore, inside of this tortoise-shaped box were six silver tablets (which were originally thought to have been made from tin), of these six tablets, one had the Chinese inscription Fude Changshou (Chinese: 福德長壽; pinyin: *fú dé cháng shòu*, "good fortune, virtue, and to live a long life"), the second tablet has the inscription Qian Yuan Heng Li Zhen (Chinese: 乾元亨利貞; pinyin: *qián yuán hēng lì zhēn*, a cryptic phrase from the I-Ching), and A third tablet has the inscription Wanggang Dasheng (Chinese: 王剛大聖; pinyin: *wáng gāng dà shèng*). Three of the discovered silver tablets were too fragile to undergo cleaning and their inscriptions can't be read. The discovery of the Taiping Tongbao cash coins were an important find as it might suggest that the Rufu Stone Pagoda was constructed during this period. | Between 976 and 989 |
| November 10, 2011 | The Golden Horse River, Wenjiang District, Chengdu, Sichuan | A large number of Chinese cash coins. | It was reported on November 10, 2011, by the Sichuan News Network (四川新闻网) that a large number of local residents of the Wenjiang District, Chengdu, Sichuan were recovering cash coins from the Golden Horse River (traditional Chinese: 金馬河; simplified Chinese: 金马河; pinyin: *jīn mǎ hé*). The Golden Horse River hoard is considered particularly unusual among Chinese coin hoards, because the bronze Chinese cash coins that were unearthed came from many different periods and dynasties in Chinese history spanning over two millennia. The local residents arrived with shovels, hoes, sickles, and any other equipment used for digging to search for more coins. Some of the local residents managed to dig up several kilograms of cash coins while other locals were only able to find ten or twenty cash coins. Soon the local police was alerted by the local authorities and they tried to cordon off the area to let the local Bureau of Cultural Relics dispatch archeologists to retrieve the cash coins. The treasure hunting done by the local residents was seen as "looting" because in accordance to the law of the People's Republic of China all cultural relics that are buried on land or discovered somewhere in the territorial waters or seas of China are at all times to be considered state property, and the local residents were asked by the police to "return" their findings. After the Chengdu archaeologists had arrived on the scene they had determined that the cash coins from the Golden Horse River board were strewn over an area approximately two hundred meters long and one hundred meters wide. Within only a short period of time the Chengdu archaeologists had managed to find over 5 kilograms of cash coins. The local archeologists stated that it was not practical to try to excavate the site or even attempt to preserve it because that there was a possibility of dangerous flood waters suddenly appearing. A few local archaeologists speculated as to why the cash coins were found there spun over such a large period of time, Mr. Liu Yumao (刘雨茂) noted that it was customary throughout Chinese history to place old cash coins into structures that were built for things such as irrigation and water conservancy, this superstition was done in the hopes of gaining good fortune and to avoid disaster. Liu Yumao further stated that the cash coins from the Golden Horse River hoard may have originally been buried inside of such a structure, and that later over time this structure had eroded and was washed. After this the cash coins could then have been carried across the river by the current and eventually ended at the site where they were found. As to why most of the unearthed cash coins came from the Tang dynasty period, local archeologist Mr. Wang Zongxiong (王仲雄) noted that it was possible that during this period a boat which was carrying coins across the Golden Horse River may have sunk and that the cash coins in its cargo were hidden underwater until they were found in 2011. While most cash coins found at the Golden Horse River hoard are Tang dynasty period Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶) and Qianyuan Zhongbao (乾元重寶), while other inscriptions of cash coins found at the Golden Horse River hoard range from Han dynasty period Wu Zhu (五銖), Xin dynasty Huo Quan (貨泉) to Manchu Qing dynasty period Qianlong Tongbao (乾隆通寶) as well as Guangxu coinage (光緒錢). | Various periods |

The cash coins were issued during different reign periods by over ten emperors, which was a first for any single tomb located in Qianjiang. According to the Qianjiang Cultural Relics Bureau the discovery of this tomb will contribute greatly to the understanding of how local past burial customs were observed during the time and it would also contribute to the understanding of the historical changes that had occurred in the region during the Song dynasty period. The inscriptions on the discovered cash coins include Han dynasty period Wu Zhu (五銖), Tang dynasty period Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寳), and Song dynasty period Taiping Taobao (太平通寶, 976–989), Jingde Yuanbao (景德元寶, 998–1022), and Xining Tongbao (熙寧通寶, 1068–1085). | Song dynasty period |

| August 18, 2012 | Zaozhuang, Shandong | The smallest Chinese cash coins ever found. | It was reported on August 18, 2012, by China Central Television on an unusual coin hoard in Zaozhuang, Shandong. The hoard is unusual because the discovered coin may be the smallest Chinese cash coin that has ever been found. The China Central Television report stated that the cash coin was "paper-thin with a rough edge and no larger than a fingernail". While the cash coin has no inscription, it is believed to be a privately produced cash coin from the Southern and Northern dynasties period. The reporters noted that these diminutive cash coins were produced by people whom they described as "money-mad governors and greedy landlords" with the reason given by China Central Television being "to squeeze poor peasants" Furthermore, the report noted that during the Southern and Northern dynasties period 10,000 of these cash coins would not have been sufficient to purchase a single bowl of rice. | Southern and Northern dynasties period |
| Early October 2012 | Wangminxiang Hongtaicun Village (王民乡红太村), Xiji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region | 17 Kushan coins | In early October 2012, a villager digging near an old wall had unearthed 17 ancient Silk Road coins in Wangminxiang Hongtaicun Village (王民乡红太村), Xiji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. According to Mr. Su Zhengxi (苏正喜) of the Xiji Prefecture Coin Museum (西吉县钱币博物馆) these are coins issued by the Kushan Empire. The coins are about 1.2 to 1.5 centimeters in diameter, they have a thickness of 0.25 centimeters, and they tend to have a weight between 2.4 and 3.7 grams. The description of the Kushan coins from this hoard are described differently by different newspaper reports. According to some articles the discovered Kushan coins bear the image of a king on one side and the image of either a cow or an ox on their reverse sides. An article from another newspaper report state that there are written letters on one side of the cooks and an image of a cow or oxen on the other side. Su Zhengxi mentions that three of the discovered bronze Kushan coins have inscriptions that are written in a "foreign (non-Chinese) script". Another newspaper article mentions that the Kushan coins were minted (struck) in the same manner as ancient Greek coins were and that the obverse sides of the coins have legends that are written in a form of "Kushanised" Greek letters. This article mentions that the reverse sides of the unearthed coins in Xiji County are said to have images of ancient Persian and Indian deities. This coin hoard is notably the first one in Ningxia that contains Kushan coinage, and this was the largest hoard of such coins that up until this point have ever been discovered in Ningxia, and for the first time Silk Road coins have been unearthed that were not mixed with any other types of coins. Previous to this coin hoard in Xiji County, the only Kushan coinages of this type that have been unearthed anywhere in China have included around "several tens of coins" that were discovered in the Loulan ruins (楼兰遗址) and Hotan County, Xinjiang. While historical records do mention that the area where these coins were discovered in formed a part of the Silk Road, there had been no prior archaeological evidence to confirm these claims, but this coin hoard is the archeological evidence that was needed to verify these claims. | Mid-Yuan dynasty period | The Xiji Prefecture Coin Museum |
| November to December 2012 | The Yujiabu cemetery in Zhangqiu, Jinan Shandong | Wu Zhu and Daquan Wushi cash coins | During excavations conducted from November to December in 2012 in the Yujiabu cemetery in Zhangqiu, Jinan Shandong, the Jinan Municipal Archaeological Institute had discovered a number of cash coins in the tombs. The excavation had discovered a total of seventeen tombs, including earth shaft tombs from the Han dynasty period, earth shaft tombs with a brick-built outer coffin from the Han dynasty period, brick-chamber tombs from the Han dynasty period, and an earth pit tomb with cave chamber from the Qing dynasty period. The 6 earth shafts mostly yielded Wu Zhu cash coins, while the tombs identified as "Tomb M3" and "Tomb M8" contained Xin dynasty period Daquan Wushi (大泉五十) cash coins, indicating that the people buried there were likely done so during the Xin dynasty period rather than the Han dynasty era. | Han and Xin dynasty periods |

| 2013 | The tomb of Emperor Jiemin of Northern Wei in Luoyang, Henan | A gold solidus issued during the reign of Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus | In the year 2013 a gold Eastern Roman coin had been discovered inside of a tomb preliminarily concluded to be that of Emperor Jiemin of Northern Wei in Luoyang, Henan. The gold coin is a solidus issued during the reign of Emperor Anastasius I Dicorus and has a diameter of between 2.1 and 2.2 centimeters. According to the archaeologists at the site, the discovery of this solidus inside of an imperial Chinese tomb provides further evidence that the city of Luoyang was the eastern terminus of the Silk Road. | Northern and Southern dynasties dynasty |
| 2013 | Weihe River, Xi'an city, Shaanxi province | A silver turtle-shaped *Bai Jin San Pin* (白金三品) coin produced during the Han dynasty period. | In 2013, while sand dredgers were excavating in the dried up bed of the Weihe River (渭河) in the northern suburbs of the city of Xi'an they discovered turtle-shaped silver *Bai Jin San Pin* (白金三品) coin. The coin is 1.6 inches (40 millimeters) in length, 0.8 inch (21 millimeters) in width, and has a thickness of 0.12 inch (3.1 millimeters). The coin weighs 10 grams. The obverse side of this silver coin is dome-shaped with its middle being thick and its edges thin, it has a scaly armour design indicating that it is the design of a turtle *Bai Jin San Pin* coin as is mentioned in the *Records of the Grand Historian* (《史记·平淮书》). This coin contains a small square seal located at its centre right. This counterstamp is believed to be the Chinese seal script character *shao* (少), referring to the shaofu (少府). The reverse side of this turtle-shaped *Bai Jin San Pin* coin is flat. Its reverse inscription consists of 2 vertically written seal script characters. According to Mr. Huang Xiquan (黄锡全), a notable and recognised numismatic expert and the former head of the China Numismatic Museum, these two seal script characters are read as *chui guang* (垂光). Huang Xiquan noted that meaning of *chui guang* in this context refers to the achievements of the Han dynasty Emperor Wu and stands for "glory illuminates, bounties bestowed to the world" (光辉普照，恩泽人间之意). The turtle is also an ancient Chinese symbol used to illustrate the concepts of "longevity" and "immortality". | 119–115 BC |
| January 25, 2013 | The Fuhaiyuan Temple (福海院) in Anxi County, Quanzhou, Fujian | 27.5 kilograms of Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins. | It was reported on January 25, 2013, that during a renovation of one of the rear halls of the Fuhaiyuan Temple (福海院) in Anxi County, Quanzhou, Fujian, a buried jar containing 27.5 kilograms of ancient Chinese cash coins was discovered. All of these cash coins date to the Tang dynasty period and have the inscription Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶). Construction on the temple began in the year 900 and it remains unknown why the cash coins were buried there. A local official named Ms. Lin Meilian (林美莲) speculated that, despite the Fuhaiyuan Temple being the largest temple in the area during the Tang period, the cash coins might have been buried at the temple as a "rainy day fund". | Around 900 |
| February 20, 2013 | Chenzhou, Anren County, Hunan | 7.5 kg of Tang, Song, and Mongol Yuan dynasty cash coins. | On February 20, 2013, workers digging at a construction site had unearthed a "money pit" that dated back some seven centuries in the city of Chenzhou, Anren County, Hunan. The "money pit" contained approximately 7.5 kg of cash coins dating from the late Southern Song dynasty period until the early Mongol Yuan dynasty period, with a few cash coins dating as far back as the Tang dynasty. The report on the find was covered by Mr. Cai Ning (蔡宁) of the Anren Prefecture Cultural Relics Administrative Office (安仁县文物管理所) and Mr. Duan Bangqiong (段邦琼) of the Anren Prefecture Bureau of Culture, Broadcasting and the Press (安仁县文广新局). Over 20 different inscriptions of Southern Song dynasty cash coins had been recovered at the site. The reported cash coin inscriptions from the hoard include (among others) the Tang dynasty period Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶), Song dynasty period Chongning Tongbao (崇寧通寶), Chongning Zhongbao (崇寧重寶), Zhenghe Tongbao (政和通寶), Huangsong Tongbao (皇宋通寶), and Xianping Zhongbao (咸平重寶), and the Mongol Yuan dynasty period Dade Tongbao (大德通寶). Furthermore, the inscriptions mentioned by the news articles include Jingyuan Tongbao (景元通寶, Cảnh Nguyên Thông Bảo), which is sometimes attributed to Vietnam, but the cash coins true origins remain unknown, and Chunhua Tongbao (淳化通寶). What's notable about this find is that no historical sources or major Chinese coin catalogues ever mentioned either the Chunhua **Tong**bao (淳化**通**寶) cash coins or the Xianping **Zhong**bao (咸平**重**寶) cash coins, as these might have been cast during the same periods as the Chunhua Yuanbao (淳化元寶) cash coins and the Xianping Yuanbao (咸平元寶) cash coins, respectively. While no other Chunhua Tongbao cash coin has ever been known to exist prior to this find, another Xianping Zhongbao was unearthed in 2010 in Shaanxi. If the reports on these cash coins turn out to be true then this Anren County coin hoard would be considered a significant find in Chinese numismatics. | Early Yuan dynasty period |
| March 2013 | Longshan Village (龙山村) near Xuzhou, Jiangsu | "Several tens" of Song dynasty period cash coins | In an article published by the Pengcheng Daily (彭城晚报) newspaper in their May 6, 2013, edition it was reported that in March 2013 archaeologists were excavating a brick Ming dynasty period tomb they had found Song dynasty cash coins in Longshan Village (龙山村) near Xuzhou, Jiangsu. During the excavation the archeologists were tasked with moving the entire tomb to the Suining County Museum (睢宁县博物馆). Usually tombs can be fairly easily attributed to a time period because of the coinages found inside of them but this is not the case for this tomb as no Ming dynasty period cash coins were found inside of it. The tomb is attributed to the year 1595 during the Ming dynasty period because it contains the inscription "Wanli Er Shi San Nian Si Yue Wang Ri" (萬曆二十三年四月望日, "15th day of the 4th (lunar) month of the 23rd year of Wanli Emperor") written above the door of the coffin chamber, the tomb contains two skulls which the archeologists believed belonged to a married couple. The wooden caskets where they would have lied inside of have completely decayed and only some coffin nails remain. Inside of this old tomb the only coins that were found were exclusively Song dynasty cash coins, during the excavation of the tomb "several tens" of Chinese cash coins had been discovered by the archeologists on the floor located on the left side of the chamber that housed the coffins. According to the Pengcheng Daily the room had been "disturbed" in the past, which means that it is unclear if the cash coins were found in the original location as according to burial customs of the time, the Song cash coins were in all likelihood placed either underneath the corpses or somewhere inside of the wooden casket. The Chinese archaeologists stated that "unless the deceased were Buddhists or coin collectors", the answer as to why only Song dynasty period cash coins were located inside of the tom must probably have to do with another contemporary Chinese burial custom. The archeologists speculate that the custom might be a Ming dynasty version of the "five emperor coins" used today with Qing dynasty cash coins. The cash coins found were produced during the reign of Emperor Shenzong and have the inscriptions Xining Zhongbao (熙寧重寶) and Yuanfeng Tongbao (元豐通寶). These legends can be viewed as auspicious inscriptions as the "Xining" (熙寧, "peaceful prosperity") and "Yuanfeng" (元豐, "primary abundance") period titles, or era names, both have auspicious meanings. | 1595 |
| May 3, 2013 | Guangxingdian Village (广兴店村), Pingquan, Hebei | 600 Ming knives | It was reported on May 3, 2013, that Mr. Liu Jiafu (刘佳富), a villager from Pingquan, Hebei, had discovered a buried clay pot containing about 600 specimen knife money in Guangxingdian Village (广兴店村). According to Mr. Chang Wen (常文) from the Cultural Relics Protection Bureau of Pingquan County (平泉县问保所) all of the knife money found were "Ming knives" issued by Yan. | Warring States period |
| May 18, 2013 | Guzhen County, Anhui | 500 pounds of cash coins rom the Tang and Northern Song dynasties | In a news report broadcast by the Anhui TV Station (安徽卫视) on May 18, 2013, it was reported that Chinese archaeologists from the Guzhen County Bureau of Cultural Relics (固镇县文物局) dug up 500 pounds of cash coins in Guzhen County, Anhui. The cash coins were discovered stacked together in a very orderly manner. The Chinese archaeologists speculate that most of the cash coins they found would have been threaded together on strings and that they were then neatly arranged. However, by the time of the excavation the strings that held the cash coins together have long since rotted away and many of the unearthed cash coins were corroded together. The unearthed coins include Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶) cash coins from the Tang dynasty period, as well as Yuanfeng Tongbao (元豐通寶), Yuanyou Tongbao (元祐通寶), Chongning Tongbao (崇寧通寶) cash coins among others from the Northern Song dynasty period. The archeologists of the Guzhen County Bureau of Cultural Relics suspect that the cash coins probably belonged to a rich family during the Northern Song dynasty period that wanted to hide the money from robbers or during a time of unrest. | Northern Song dynasty period |

It was later reported on May 2, 2013, that the number of unearthed Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins at the site had almost reached 10,000. | Tang dynasty period |
| Early August 2013 | Renhezhai Village, Xiping County, Zhumadian, Henan | An undocumented number of Northern Song dynasty period cash coins. | It was reported by Dahe Daily on September 16, 2013, that a coin excavation has been conducted by local villagers in Renhezhai Village, Xiping County, Zhumadian, Henan.

Of the coins that were excavated at the site, most dated back to the Northern Song dynasty period. | Northern Song dynasty period |

| 2015 | The tomb of the Marquis of Haihun in Xinjian, Nanchang, Jiangxi | Around 2,000,000 Wu Zhu cash coins weighing 10 tonnes | In 2015 Chinese archeologists uncovered 10 tonnes of bronze Wu Zhu cash coins from the Western Han dynasty (or around 2 million cash coins) alongside over ten thousand of other iron, bronze, and gold items in the Haihunhou cemetery near Nanchang, Jiangxi, among the other uncovered items were bamboo slips, wood tablets, as well as jade objects. As these Wu Zhu cash coins were strung in strings of 1000 pieces this proved that the practice of stringing cash coins per 1000 didn't first happen during the Tang dynasty as was previously thought but actually six hundred years earlier. By 2017 the cash coins unearthed at the site had numbered to around 2,000,000 Wu Zhu cash coins, on January 9, 2017, iFeng.com reported that a rare Wu Zhu cash coin with a character that was found to have been carved upside down. | Western Han dynasty period |
| January 26, 2015 | Xinjiang County, Shanxi | Over 12,000 Northern Song dynasty period iron cash coins | On January 26, 2015, the Shanxi News Network (山西新闻网) reported that over 12,000 iron cash coins produced during the Northern Song dynasty had been recovered at an archaeological site, situated on a high precipice, in the historical prefecture of Jiangzhou, located in Xinjiang County, Shanxi. The iron cash coins were unearthed during a 20-month excavation by the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology (山西省考古研究所). While the unearthed iron cash coins were severely corroded, after the archeologists had treating them for rust, it was revealed that the iron cash coins originated during six reign periods in the mid and late Northern Song dynasty period. The inscriptions of the iron cash coins were Xining Tongbao (熙寧通寶), Yuanyou Tongbao (元祐通寶), Shaosheng Yuanbao (紹聖元寶), Chongning Tongbao (崇寧通寶), Daguan Tongbao (大觀通寶), and Zhenghe Tongbao (政和通寶). The most commonly found inscription in the hoard was Zhenghe Tongbao. Other than the iron cash coins, the archeologists had further unearthed several furnaces (爐灶, *lú zào*) and crucibles (坩堝, *gān guō*). It remains currently unknown whether or not the furnaces and crucibles are somehow related to the over 12,000 iron cash coins that were uncovered. | Northern Song dynasty period |
| Approx. 10:00 AM March 21, 2015 | Longgang Town, Yancheng, Jiangsu | Tang and Song dynasty period cash coins | At approximately 10:00 AM on March 21, 2015, the excavator was dredging a small 6-meter wide river that runs through Longgang Town, Yancheng, Jiangsu had uncovered a pile of ancient Chinese cash coins dating to the Tang and Song dynasties that had been stored inside of a earthenware pot. After the word of the coin hoard had spread throughout the village, a number of local residents started to "treasure hunt" in the area looking for more old cash coins. The villagers had found around 200–300 catties (267–400 pounds, 121–181 kilograms) of cash coins before they were chased away by the police because it's illegal in the People's Republic of China to take "cultural relics" as they're all legally government property. Zhao Yongzheng (赵永正) of the Archaeology Department of the Yancheng Museum (盐城市博物馆考古部) noted that this coin cache was probably buried there somewhere at the beginning of the Southern Song dynasty period. The inscriptions of the unearthed cash coins included the Tang dynasty period Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寶), as well as the Song dynasty period Taiping Tongbao (太平通寶), Tiansheng Yuanbao (天聖元寶), Xiangfu Yuanbao (祥符元寶), Zhenghe Tongbao (政和通寶). | Southern Song dynasty period |
| May 11, 2015 | Mengyuan Village (孟塬乡) Pengyang County, Guyuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region | A Western Xia period Da An Bao Qian (大安寶錢, 𘜶𗵐𘏨𘔭) cash coin and a Northern Song dynasty Chunhua Yuanbao (淳化元寶) cash coin. | According to an article published on May 11, 2015, two cash coins were uncovered in Mengyuan Village (孟塬乡) Pengyang County, Guyuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The two cash coins were obtained by the Pengyang County Office of Chronicles Compilation (彭阳县史志办公室) from a local coin collector named Mr. Hu (虎). The first cash coin is a Western Xia period Da An Bao Qian (大安寶錢, 𘜶𗵐𘏨𘔭) cash coin with a diameter of 2.4 centimeters. Its inscription is notably written in a "slanted character" variety (斜字版, *Xié zì bǎn*) of Tangut script and it has a blank reverse. The second cash coin is a Chunhua Yuanbao (淳化元寶) cash coin produced during the Northern Song dynasty period. It is notably a rare version of the regular script (or "royally inscribed") variety of the coin, as the "氵" radical of the Chinese character "淳" is a "shortened" variant which does not extend all the way to the bottom of the character, as the more "common" variants of the Northern Song dynasty's Chunhua Yuanbao cash coins tend to have. Because of the way the radical looks, this type of Chunhua Tongbao is known to Chinese numismatists as the "shortened shui" or "shrunken shui" variety (縮水版, *Suōshuǐ bǎn*) and only a handful of authentic specimens of the "shortened shui" Chunhua Tongbao cash coins are known to exist. According to Qi Yuezhang (祁悦章) from the Pengyang County Office of Chronicles Compilation both of the cash coins were deemed to be authentic specimens. Of ancient cash coins that are held in the collection of the Pengyang County Office of Cultural Relics (彭阳县文物馆) over half of them were produced by either the Tangut Western Xia dynasty and Song dynasty. | Western Xia and Northern Song dynasties period |
| June 16, 2015 | Yuncheng "salt lake" (运城盐池), Yuncheng, Shanxi | 500 clay moulds | It was reported on June 16, 2015, by the Yuncheng News Network (运城新闻网) that two bird photographers and enthusiasts of the "salt lake culture", Mr. Jing Xiaoxiong (景晓雄) and Mr. Zhang Xiaobie (张小别) had discovered 500 clay moulds used to cast iron cash coins during the Song dynasty period. The clay moulds were located at the Yuncheng "salt lake" (运城盐池), which is sometimes known as "China's Dead Sea" (中国死海) located near the city of Yuncheng, Shanxi. While quite a number of these clay moulds were in good condition with very distinct inscriptions, many of the around five hundred clay moulds are in poor condition. The inscriptions on the discovered Song dynasty era coin moulds include Yuanfeng Tongbao (元豐通寶), Chongning Tongbao (崇寧通寶), Daguan Tongbao (大觀通寶), Zhenghe Tongbao (政和通寶), and seal script Zhenghe Zhongbao (政和重寶). The discovery of the clay coin moulds is notable because no historical documents have ever mentioned that the city of Hedong (河東), the name of Yuncheng during the Song dynasty period, had a mint, nor have any ruins of a mint been discovered in the area. The discovery of the clay coin moulds will further encourage the study of Song dynasty ruins in the area of Yuncheng, Shanxi to search for the possible existence of an ancient cash coin mint. | Northern Song dynasty period |

But 80% of the hoard consists of Qing dynasty coinage, namely Kangxi Tongbao (康熙通寶), Qianlong Tongbao (乾隆通寶), and Xianfeng Tongbao (咸豐通寶) cash coins. It was reported by a 75-year-old villager from the area named Ms. Wan Jixiang (万继湘), that this area of the Qianjiang District did not use cash coins in the past and that the area housed no landlords or government officials that could have accumulated such an amount of wealth. As the area has had a long history of criminality, it was speculated by some locals that the cash coins may have been buried there long ago by bandits (土匪) who were on the run. | Qing Xianfeng period |

Earlier during the same restoration of the Cishi Pagoda in 2015 a covered alms bowl with the inscription "Da Song Zhiping San Nian" (大宋治平三年, "the 3rd year of Zhiping of the Great Song") was discovered, which also indicates that the pagoda underwent a major renovation in the year 1066. | 1066 |

| October 22, 2017 | Chacun Village, Fuliang County, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi | 300,000 Song dynasty cash coins (weighing around 5.6 tonnes) | It was reported on October 27, 2017, by China Daily that about 300,000 cash coins (weighing around 5.6 tonnes) have been unearthed from under a residential house, after it had been discovered by a villager during the rebuilding of his old home, in Chacun Village, Fuliang County, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi. Archaeologists had completed the excavation of the site on October 22, 2017. Several local villagers noted that folk tales claimed that the area was owned by a wealthy landlord a millennium prior to the find, which might be the origin of the cash coins. Feng Ruqin, curator of Fuliang Museum, stated that the cash coins must have probably been collected and placed there by a folk organisation as the nominal value of the cash coins were too small to do with the landlord. The cash coins found at the site were attributed to the Song dynasty. According to the South China Morning Post Jingdezhen has been referred to as the "capital of porcelain" since the 3rd century. | Song dynasty period | The Fuliang Museum |

| Findings published in August 2021 (Excavations between 2015 and 2019) | The walled and moated city of Guanzhuang (established about 800 B.C.), Henan | 2 spade coins and dozens of clay moulds used to cast them. One of the spade coins was in near-perfect condition. | The spade coins and moulds were discovered at the Guanzhuang Mint were attributed to have been produced between 640 BCE and no later than 550 BCE, which according to Hao Zhao, an archaeologist at Zhengzhou University, in an article phnlished in *Antiquity* makes it the world's oldest known mint. Zhao stated that while other research has dated coins from the Kingdom of Lydia (a historical country in present-day Turkey) to have been created as early as 630 BCE, he notes that the earliest mint known to have produced Lydian coins dates to sometime between 575 BCE and 550 BCE, which (if true) makes the Guanzhang Mint the world's oldest known mint. George Selgin, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives at the Cato Institute, says while he notes that it is an impressive find, "It doesn't change our basic understanding of when the first coins were produced. And it doesn't necessarily mean that China did it first." saying that the find doesn't necessarily prove that the Chinese invented money before the Lydians did. In contrast Bill Maurer, a professor of anthropology at the University of California Irvine and director of the Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion, noted that the completeness of the find gives weight to the assertions made in *Antiquity*. | 640 BCE~550 BCE (Spring and Autumn period) |

| 23 October 2022 | Shuangdun Village, Jianhu County, Yancheng city, Jiangsu province | 1.5 tonnes of cash coins dating back to the Tang and Song dynasties. | During an excavation in Shuangdun Village, Jianhu County of Yancheng City in the province of Jiangsu a coin hoard consisting of 1.5 tonnes of cash coins was discovered. In ancient China, such treasure hoards were often buried in the ground by their owners to preserve precious porcelain objects, cash coins, metal tools, and other valuables. These bronze cash coins, mostly dating to the Song dynasty period, were connected to each other with a series of straw ropes and were neatly layered and paved inside of a pit mouth. This pit mouth of the coin hoard was square in shape and measured at 1.63 meters in length, 1.58 meters in width, and 0.5 meters in depth. Because these cash coins still had clear inscriptions and we're all well-preserved they can serve as important value for future archaeological and numismatic research. In total 70 wells were also discovered around the coin hoard. The location of the near a battle frontline of the Jin–Song Wars, for this reason researchers speculate if the excavation site may have belonged to a hutted military camp from this period. | Jin–Song Wars |

| 15 May 2023 | Chongde (崇德) area, Xiulin, Hualien County, Taiwan province | A trove of artifacts (such as bracelets and agate beads), including cash coins dating to the Song dynasty 900 years ago. | Wu Chin-yi (吳勁毅), the director of the Hualien Cultural Affairs Bureau stated that while digging at a construction site to lay a foundation, workers stumbled upon what appeared to be the corner of a tomb. The owner of the allowed the Hualien Cultural Affairs Bureau to investigate the site where they found an abundance of items including Song dynasty period cash coins. The vast number of artifacts delayed the construction work by 2 months. A number of items in the hoard are dated to the middle of the Taiwanese iron age and proved that the indigenous people living there may have had more extensive trade with China than was previously thought. However, there's still some debate if the cash coins were deposited there at the time they were in circulation or disposed there at a much later time. | Hualien Archeological Museum |
