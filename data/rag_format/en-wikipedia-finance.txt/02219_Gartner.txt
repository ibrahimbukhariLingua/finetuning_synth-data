Gideon Gartner founded Gartner, Inc. in 1979. Originally private, the company launched publicly as **Gartner Group** in 1986 before Saatchi & Saatchi acquired it in 1988.

In 1990, Gartner Group was acquired by some of its executives, including Gartner himself, with funding from Bain Capital and Dun & Bradstreet. The company went public again in 1993. In 2000, the name was simplified from *Gartner Group* to **Gartner**.

In 2000, Gartner coined the term Supranet. Gene Hall has been the CEO of the company since August 2004.

In the course of its growth, Gartner has acquired numerous companies providing related services, including Real Decisions—which became Gartner Measurement, now part of Gartner's consulting division—and Gartner Dataquest, a market research firm. It acquired Datapro Information Services, a computer industry analysis-focused unit of McGraw-Hill, in 1997; that in turn had once been Datapro Research Corporation of Delran Township, New Jersey.
