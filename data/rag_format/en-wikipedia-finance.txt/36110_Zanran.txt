## History

Zanran was co-founded by Dr. Yves Dassas and Dr Jon Goldhill in 2006. After selling their telecoms company, the founders initially started Zanran as a search engine for data and statistics on the internet.

Zanran was praised by its 50,000 subscribers at that time for its innovative approach to data search. It was featured in various tech publications and continued to serve as a valuable tool for data-driven research for more than a decade after its launch.

Zanran subsequently commercialised its expertise to searching and extracting data â€“ especially numerical data - from documents and reports in PDF format.
