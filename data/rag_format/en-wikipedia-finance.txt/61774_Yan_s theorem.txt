Yan's theorem


# Yan's theorem



In probability theory, **Yan's theorem** is a separation and existence result. It is of particular interest in financial mathematics where one uses it to prove the Kreps-Yan theorem.

The theorem was published by Jia-An Yan. It was proven for the L¹ space and later generalized by Jean-Pascal Ansel to the case {\displaystyle 1\leq p<+\infty }.


## Yan's theorem

### Statement

Let {\displaystyle (\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)} be a probability space, {\displaystyle 1\leq p<+\infty } and {\displaystyle B\_{+}} be the space of non-negative and bounded random variables. Further let {\displaystyle K\subseteq L^{p}(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)} be a convex subset and {\displaystyle 0\in K}.

Then the following three conditions are equivalent:

1. For all {\displaystyle f\in L\_{+}^{p}(\Omega ,{\mathcal {F}},P)} with {\displaystyle f\neq 0} exists a constant {\displaystyle c>0}, such that {\displaystyle cf\not \in {\overline {K-B\_{+}}}}.
2. For all {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {F}}} with {\displaystyle P(A)>0} exists a constant {\displaystyle c>0}, such that {\displaystyle cI\_{A}\not \in {\overline {K-B\_{+}}}}.
3. There exists a random variable {\displaystyle Z\in L^{q}}, such that {\displaystyle Z>0} almost surely and
