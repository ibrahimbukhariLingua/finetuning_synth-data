National Wind


# National Wind



**National Wind, LLC**, A Trishe Group of Company, is a Minneapolis company founded in 2003 that is a developer of large-scale, community-based wind energy projects. The company, along with National Wind Assessments, has 50 employees based in Minneapolis, MN and Grand Forks, North Dakota. National Wind claims to be the nation's leading developer of community-based wind farms.


## Community-based model

National Wind operates under a community-based business model. Each wind project is structured as its own limited liability company (LLC) and is formed as a partnership between National Wind and local community members and landowners. Although National Wind is generally the developer and manager of its wind projects, it shares ownership of each project company with members of the communities where the wind farm is located. National Wind highlights the benefits of the community model, saying that community ownership benefits local economies along with the environment.

National Wind's business model differs from the structure of most other wind developers. Traditionally, when a company builds a wind farm, they become the sole owners of the development. The owners of the land where the farm is built tend to have minimal involvement with projects developer. In the traditional model, landowners do not own shares of the wind project, but instead are either paid a monthly lease or given royalties from the sale of electricity. On the other hand, National Wind's model aims to share both revenue and influence within local communities.


## Projects

National Wind develops and manages wind farms that produce, at minimum, 50 megawatts of renewable energy. Most of the company's developments are located in the Midwestern United States in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, and Ohio. Currently, National Wind has twelve families of utility-scale wind projects in development or operation.
