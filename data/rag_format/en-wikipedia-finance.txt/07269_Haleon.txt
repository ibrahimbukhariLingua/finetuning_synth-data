## History

GSK and Pfizer merged their consumer healthcare businesses in 2019. GSK owned just over two thirds of the joint venture, and Pfizer held the remainder.

GSK announced plans to spin off Haleon in 2018, in order to give the "tired drugmaker extra focus and firepower by gearing up and hiving off the consumer division".

Unilever offered £50 billion for the business in 2022, in a bid which GSK rejected. Nestlé examined the possibility of a bid in conjunction with Reckitt.

In October 2023, GSK reduced its ownership share in Haleon to just over 7.4%, and again in January 2024 down to 4.2%.

The Lamisil antifungal brand was sold to Karo Healthcare AB for £235 million in August 2023; the transaction was completed in November 2023.

The ChapStick lip care brand was sold to Yellow Wood Partners for £401 million in 2024.

In March 2024, Pfizer reduced its stake in Haleon from 32% to 24% by selling 630 million shares in a public offering.

In April 2024 Haleon announced that it planned to close its factory in Maidenhead. Toothpaste manufacturing would be relocated to Slovakia, with mouthwash production outsourced to a third-party.

In September 2024, the company completed the sale of its non-US Nicotine Replacement Therapy business to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in a deal worth £458 million.
