### Commodity Indices

The Refinitiv family of commodity indices represents specific subsets of commodities. Our commodity indices are among our most popular and most tracked indices, including the “Refinitiv/CoreCommodity CRB Index” and the “Refinitiv Equal Weight commodity Index”.


### "Alpha-creating Indices"

Despite the fact that the term is an oxymoron, among Refinitiv’s products are something the company markets as "alpha-creating indices" and "optimal indices".

"Refinitiv Lipper Optimal Indices" include five, asset allocation-oriented "indices" that allegedly assess the trade-off between risk and return in diversified portfolios. The five "Target Risk Optimal Indices" are:

* Aggressive Growth
* Growth
* Moderate
* Conservative
* Very Conservative

These "indices" are "optimized" and according to the marketing department at Refinitiv "build on modern portfolio theory to depict the best investment outcome for various levels of risk". "Optimal Target Risk Indices" are used singly or in conjunction with other indices as benchmarks for individual investor portfolios, performance benchmarks for target risk, or as the basis for wealth management.


### Custom Indices & Index calculation services

Refinitiv also creates custom indices and provides calculation services for clients.
