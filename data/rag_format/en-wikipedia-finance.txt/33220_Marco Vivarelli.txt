## Research Focuses

In 1995 Vivarelli published *The Economics of Technology and Employment: Theory and Empirical Evidence*, Elgar, Cheltenham, reprinted 1997.

He is author of more than 85 scientific publications in refereed international journals.

His current research interests include the relationship between innovation, employment and skills; the labour market and income distribution impacts of globalization; the entry and post-entry performance of newborn firms. From a methodological point of view, his articles are based on microeconometric evidence.

As far as the link between innovation and employment is concerned, his research provides theoretical arguments and empirical evidence showing that the mainstream optimism about the full compensation of technological unemployment by market forces is unfounded. Indeed, product innovation is generally labour friendly but process innovation (for instance robots) may negatively affect employment, while compensation may be affected by several market failures. As a policy implication, product innovation in high-tech and emerging sectors should be fostered and safety nets should be framed for the possible victims of automation.

As far as globalization is concerned, his research output provides evidence that globalization may have controversial effect in terms of employment, skills and income distribution. In contrast with the mainstream optimism about the overall positive impact of free trade and FDI, globalization - combined with technology transfer - may imply job losses and increasing inequality (in particular in the developing countries). As a policy implication, controlled and gradual globalization should be encouraged and coupled with proper social measures.

As far as the entry and post-entry performance of newborn firms are concerned, the empirical results of his research show that - contrary to the entrepreneurial vulgate - only a tiny minority of new firms are innovative and that most of new ventures are doomed to early failure. As a policy implication, *"erga omnes"* policies fostering firm formation should be avoided, while entry and post-entry subsidies should be targeted and very selective.
