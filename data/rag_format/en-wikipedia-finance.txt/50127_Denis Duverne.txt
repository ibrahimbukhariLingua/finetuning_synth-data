Duverne began his career in 1979 at the French Ministry of Finance within the national tax authority.

From 1984 to 1986, he was a commercial counselor to the Consulate General of France in New York.

In 1986, he took over the responsibility for corporate tax and then indirect taxes at the tax legislation department of the French tax authority.

In 1991, he became secretary general of IBI, a financial advisory company.
