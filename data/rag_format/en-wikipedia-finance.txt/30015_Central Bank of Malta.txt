Central Bank of Malta


# Central Bank of Malta



The **Central Bank of Malta** (Maltese: *Bank Ċentrali ta’ Malta*) is the Maltese member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for Malta from 1968 to 2007, issuing the Maltese lira. Since 2014, it has also been Malta's national competent authority within European Banking Supervision.

The Central Bank of Malta Act was originally published by means of Act XXXI of 1967. It has been amended a number of times, most recently by Acts I and IV of 2007 in order to provide for the bank's membership within the Eurosystem.

The Central Bank of Malta is located in an early 20th-century building. Completed in 1924 as the Vernon Institute, or Vernon Club. The bank occupied the building since 1967, but made arrangement for the lease of the premises in 1968, with a contract lasting almost hundred years. The interior was eventually demolished in 1968, keeping the façade, to be redeveloped and housing the present Central Bank of Malta. In 2004, the building was bought from the Government of Malta by the bank.
