After an investigation by the Federal Reserve, four officials at the bank resigned. In September 1994, India fined the bank $16.29 million, the most of any bank of the 20 banks implicated in the scandal, which were fined a total of $47 million.

In 2011, the company was fined Rs 25 lakh for violations of know your customer and antiâ€“money laundering rules after a fraud of Rs 400-crore was perpetrated via one of the company's branches. In 2019, Citibank paid Rs 4.5 crore to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India of failure to adequately supervise an employee after the employee used the bank's infrastructure to forge bank statements of clients.

Ashu Khullar was named chief executive officer in 2019.

In March 2023, the division was acquired by Axis Bank.
