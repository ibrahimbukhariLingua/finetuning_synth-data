## Business career

As a teenager, Kohler worked as a laborer or technician for every division of Kohler Co., which specialised in manufacturing plumbing products. He was awarded a bachelor's degree in industrial administration in 1965 by Yale University. After graduation, he joined the Kohler Company full-time and, in 1972, was appointed chief executive officer.

### Kohler Environmental Center

In 2012, the Kohler Environmental Center (KEC) at Choate Rosemary Hall was inaugurated. The building was named after Herbert Kohler, who donated the $20 million required to build it. It has an area of 32,000 square feet (3,000 m²) and is designed to have a low environmental impact, using features such as solar panels, composting, and a greenhouse heated with used cooking oil. The KEC is situated on a 266 acres (108 ha) plot of forest and wetlands, which can be incorporated into classes focused on the environment.
