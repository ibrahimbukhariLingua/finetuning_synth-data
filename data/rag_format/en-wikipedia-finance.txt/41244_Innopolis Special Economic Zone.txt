## History


### Special economic zones in the Russian Federation

Special economic zones (SEZs) are territories endowed with special legal status in the Russian Federation that provide advantageous economic conditions for their residents and partners. SEZs are designed to attract direct investment as well as foster entrepreneurship and development in the region. Investors in such zones receive tax and customs benefits, rental incentives, special infrastructure and other opportunities. Foreign residents are able to take advantage of simplified regulatory procedures related to investment, administration and business operations. As of 2020, there were 33 special economic zones in Russia, seven of which are technology innovation zones. According to the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, the latter contribute to the development of “innovative activities for the creation and distribution of scientific and technical products and their industrial application.” Russian tech innovation SEZs are usually located in research and educational centers and are designed to promote innovative industries.


### Innopolis

On November 1, 2012, the Government of Russia adopted Resolution No. 1131 on the creation of the SEZ “Innopolis” with a total area of 311 hectares within the Verkhneuslonsky and Laishevsky districts of Tatarstan. This SEZ became the fifth technology innovation zone in Russia and the second special economic zone in Tatarstan after the establishment of “Alabuga”. At the end of 2017, shares of both “Alabuga” and “Innopolis” worth about 32 billion rubles were transferred to right-to-use arrangements to the government of the Republic of Tatarstan. In 2019, the territory of Innopolis was removed from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Digital Development to the control of the Minister of Economy of Tatarstan, a decision that, according to the government of the republic, will contribute to the “acceleration of institutional development.” In practice the Innopolis economic zone is managed by its general director Renat Khalimov and the local administration. Particularly important decisions are considered by the Board of Directors chaired by the President of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov.


## Economics


### Tax procedures and benefits

The SEZ "Innopolis" was established as a locus of entrepreneurial activity in order to attract financial and intellectual resources to the IT-industry. Innopolis investors and residents receive special preferential tax and duty treatment. The SEZ applies a special customs regime without the import and export rates. From January 2020 until 2023, residents can pay taxes under simplified tax schedules of 1% of total income or 5% from the “income minus expenses” option. The SEZ administration believes that the reduced tax rate will attract investment in small and medium-sized business projects in the IT sector. Since the end of 2019, 39 new startups with ready-made projects have been accepted by Innopolis. Over the next ten years, Innopolis is expected to attract a hundred new residents and 380 small and medium-sized businesses. The 2020 preferential package offers residents a free coworking space, their own office in a technopark, and preferential rental housing. Additionally, Innopolis offers a free business acceleration program, free mobile internet and a one-year subscription to online entertainment services.

### Transport

The city of Innopolis is 40 km away from Kazan and constitutes a part of its urban agglomeration.

In August 2020, the Prime Minister of Tatarstan, Roman Shaykhutdinov, announced the joint plans of the Innopolis University and Kamaz to launch an unmanned heavy truck.


### Engineering infrastructure

Heat is supplied to Innopolis from an automatic boiler house with a capacity of 32 MW built in 2015. Due to the lack of its own water resources, water supplied to the city is taken from the Volga. To ensure a regular water supply to the SEZ, new treatment facilities and pumping stations were built in a short timespan of three months. In August 2013, the first section of a 3.29 km gas pipeline was launched in Innopolis. Two years later, Gazprom Transgaz Kazan completed the construction of a branch of the Kazan-Gorky gas trunk line to Innopolis.
