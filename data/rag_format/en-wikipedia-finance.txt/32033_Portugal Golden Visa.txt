Portugal Golden Visa


# Portugal Golden Visa



The **Portugal Golden Visa** is an immigrant investor program by the government of Portugal that granted residency in Portugal to people who invested in properties worth at least €500,000 or created 10 jobs in Portugal.


## Golden Visa processing backlogs

Despite being advertised as a fast route to a residence card, processing of Golden Visas is extremely slow with many investors left without a residency card despite waiting multiple years after applying. As of 2023, the backlog would take an estimated 7 years, or until 2030 to be processed.

This has led investors to file lawsuits to hold the Portuguese Foreigners and Borders Service to the legally mandated 90 day processing time. However such lawsuits only move the winner to the front of the line and do not change the overall backlog. As of beginning of May 2024 around 50 lawsuits were filed per day. As of 10 May 2024 there were 7,500 lawsuits pending in total, which Porto's mayor Rui Moreira described as "a scandal".


## Golden Visa lawsuit backlogs

Despite lawsuits being advertised as a way to get the residence card within a reasonable time, there are now so many lawsuits that the courts themselves are paralyzed by a lawsuit backlog, and wait time for a lawsuit to be heard is steadily growing. As of end of May 2024 the courts were receiving around 100 new lawsuits per day.


## History

The scheme began in 2012. By 2024, the country has received 7.3 billion euros of funds through the program.

In August 2019, according to SEF, Chinese investment in Portugal under the scheme was down during the first eight months of 2019 a decrease of 15.7 percent from the same period of 2018. Investment by Brazilian nationals under the same scheme was up by almost 42 percent in 2019. Spain and Greece have programs comparable to Portugal's Gold Visa program.

The terms and criteria for the Golden visa program has changed over time and the country has tightened the rules to obtain the visa by simply buying a property in the country.
