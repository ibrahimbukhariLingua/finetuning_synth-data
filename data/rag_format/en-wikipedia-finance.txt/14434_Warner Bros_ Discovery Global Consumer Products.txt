## History

Warner Bros. Consumer Products was created by Dan Romanelli in 1984 to license the rights of the Warner Bros. library to other companies to make merchandise. When Tim Burton's *Batman* film was in production, WBCP became increasingly relevant. The merchandising campaign was the largest one in history to promote a feature film. Through WBCP licensing the rights to Batman, the studio made over $500 million through the merchandise alone.

In 1998, when Warner Bros. sold their 49% stake in Six Flags, Warner Bros. Consumer Products, Inc. began licensing the Looney Tunes and DC Comics characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Batman and Superman for use in the parks.

Under Romanelli, Consumer Products oversaw the licensing of Warner Bros. properties, and the opening of Warner Bros. Studio Stores around the world. Under Mr. Romanelli's guidance, Warner Bros. Consumer Products had grown from a small licensing enterprise to a multi-business powerhouse that included Warner Bros. Worldwide Licensing, Inc., Warner Bros. Studio Stores, Inc., wbstore.com, Worldwide Publishing, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Inc., Kids' WB! Music, WB Toys and the recently announced Live Events department.

Romanelli announced he was stepping down June 20, 2006. Brad Globe who joined Consumer Products in February 2005 as the Executive Vice President was appointed to replace him.

Brad Globe, who was made President in 2006, announced August 28, 2015, that he would be stepping down. Diane Nelson, President of DC Entertainment, took over in interim. In January 2016, it was announced by Nelson that Pam Lifford, would be the new President of Warner Bros. Consumer Products, replacing Globe.

On March 16, 2016, it was announced by Lifford, that Disney veteran Soo Koo who was the North American Vice President of Creative for Fashion and Home at Disney Consumer Products and Disney Stores, was joining as the new CCO for Warner Bros. Consumer Products.

In April 2022, following the merger of parent company WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc., **Discovery Consumer Products** (founded on April 6, 2018) merged/folded into **Warner Bros. Consumer Products** to form **Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products**.
