Freeports in the United Kingdom


# Freeports in the United Kingdom



**Freeports in the United Kingdom** are a series of government assigned special economic zones where customs rules such as taxes do not apply until goods leave the specified zone. The theoretical purpose of such freeports is to encourage economic activity in the surrounding area and increase manufacturing. Critics of such schemes, including the parliamentary opposition, see them as possible tax havens and open to money laundering.

Goods imported into freeports do not incur usual import procedures on entry and re-exit. Import duties are not payable until the goods are put into free circulation or used within the free zone.

The first freeport in the United Kingdom opened in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, as an attempt to combat de-industrialisation and a declining economy. Several freeports operated throughout the United Kingdom, but by 2012 the Conservative-led government decided not to renew their licences.

During the 2021 United Kingdom budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak announced the first eight new freeports would be created.


## History

In their 1983 manifesto, *The Challenge of Our Times*, the Conservative government outlined its plans to establish 'experimental' freeports as a part of its regional policies to modernise the British economy following the early 1980s recession. After winning a second term at the general election Margaret Thatcher's government assigned freeport status to six areas; namely Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, Glasgow Prestwick Airport and Southampton. These freeports experienced limited success during their lifetime and by 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron decided not to renew the freeport licences. Teesside MP Simon Clarke blamed the failed experiment on "an uncharacteristic lack of ambition by the Thatcher Government" and "the regulatory constraints placed on them by the EU".


## 21st century

In 2016, the then backbench MP—and later Chancellor of the Exchequer—Rishi Sunak published a white paper for the Centre for Policy Studies outlining his ideas for post-Brexit freeports similar to those in the United States. The paper titled *The Free Ports Opportunity* suggested that creation of such ports could create 86,000 jobs and help fuel the Northern Powerhouse by bringing increased trade to deprived areas. After the Conservative Party's victory in the 2019 general election, plans were announced for ten freeports to be set up by 2021 with regions bidding for free status. Up to 40 bids for freeport status were received during the process.

As part of the 2021 United Kingdom budget, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced that eight new freeports would be created in England. They are East Midlands Airport, Felixstowe and Harwich, Humber region, Liverpool City Region, Plymouth, Solent, Thames and Teesside.

The UK government named three aims behind creating freeports, promoting regeneration and job creation, creating a hub for global trade and to create a hotbed for innovation.

Other devolved governments within the United Kingdom were invited to establish freeports, one or two each. The Scottish government announced plans for so called sustainable "green ports", the Welsh government said it would continue, providing it received the same level of funding as England and the Northern Ireland Executive said it was working with the HM Treasury to implement its own site.

In October 2024, the Keir Starmer Labour government announced official clearance for five existing freeports to have customs sites, which is needed to class them as operational.

## Criticism

Proposal for freeports in the United Kingdom have been heavily criticised by opposition parties, trade unions, think tanks and various economists. Reasons for this include the possibility for use as tax havens, smuggling and a way to erode worker's rights.

Despite claims of a cross party consensus, Labour Party members showed opposition to the idea with a speaker at a Labour conference describing them as "job-destroying". Further to this, Labour party leader Keir Starmer called it "giving up" and "blind faith". Former Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell suggested it to be '"a revival of a failed Thatcherite plan from the 1980s, designed to cut away at regulation and our tax base."

At a Liberal Democrat conference in 2019, members passed a motion for the abolition of freeports due to the increased risk of money-laundering and tax evasion. Similarly the then Home Affairs spokesperson—and later leader— Sir Ed Davey suggested the UK could become the world capital of money laundering.

In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) was sceptical, with trade minister Ivan McKee calling them a "shiny squirrel" to distract from the consequences of Brexit. adding "the reputation of freeports across the world is mixed, with concerns about deregulation and risks of criminality, tax evasion and reductions in workers’ rights". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also raised concern over them being "low-cost, low-wage, low-value opportunities". Despite these remarks, in 2021 the SNP announced its own version of freeports, called 'green ports', which they say will adopt "best practice which helps deliver our net-zero emissions and fair work principles, alongside supporting regeneration and innovation ambitions".
