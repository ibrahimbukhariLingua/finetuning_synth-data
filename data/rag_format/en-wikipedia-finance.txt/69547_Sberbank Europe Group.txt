# Sberbank Europe Group



**Sberbank Europe Group** (Sberbank Europe AG) was a banking group headquartered in Vienna, Austria, and owned by Sberbank, a Russian state-controlled company. Sberbank Europe provided financial services to over 780,000 customers in eight countries in Central and Eastern Europe. It was liquidated in early March 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


## History

Sberbank Europe AG was established in 2012 after Sberbank acquired Volksbank International AG (VBI) and rebranded it Sberbank Europe. The deal involved all VBI assets – banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine and Slovakia, apart from Volksbank Romania. Société Générale and J.P.Morgan acted as financial advisors to Sberbank. Troika Dialog also advised on the transaction. The deal price was €505 million, which is 1.0x VBI book value (excluding Romania). Organizational transformation and group restructuring were exercised during that period. It was decided that the regional headquarters of Sberbank Europe Group would be in Vienna, Austria. In 2013, Sberbank Europe received a full banking license in Austria. Volksbank subsidiaries were fully rebranded as Sberbank by 2014.

Sberbank Europe obtained its first Fitch Ratings investment grade, BBB−, in 2013. Fitch affirmed its rating as BB+ with positive outlook in 2017. In 2019, Fitch upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to BBB− and confirmed it with a Stable Outlook in 2020.

In 2014 Sberbank Europe received a syndicated loan of €350m and launched Sberbank Direct in Germany, an online direct bank with basic retail products. Sberbank Direct gained €1.7 bn in deposits by 2015. In 2018, Sberbank Direct launched an online instant loan offer in Germany.

In 2015 Sberbank Europe sold 99.5% stake of its Slovak subsidiary, Sberbank Slovensko, to Penta Investments for a confidential price. Sberbank Europe AG completed the Comprehensive Assessment consisting of the Asset Quality Review (AQR) and the Stress Test conducted by the European Central Bank. In 2016, Sberbank finalized the sale of the Slovak subsidiary and converted €370m of subordinated loans (Tier II capital) into Common Equity Tier I capital, strengthening its capital structure. In December 2017, Sberbank Europe completed the sale of its stake of 99.9230% in PJSC «VS Bank» (Ukraine) to TAS Group.

2019 became Sberbank Europe's most successful financial year. The bank generated a profit after tax of EUR 40.6 million.

In 2018, Sberbank won in categories “Best Bank in CEE” by *The Banker* magazine, “Most Innovative Digital Bank in CEE” by *Global Finance* magazine and "Strongest Banking Brand in the World" by *Brand Finance* magazine. In 2020, Sberbank won the World’s Best Digital Bank Awards by *Global Finance* magazine. In 2021, the bank confirmed its title of the Strongest Banking Brand in the World according to *Brand Finance*.


### Insolvency

In late February 2022, during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, bank runs and sanctions against the bank caused CNN to state the bank "...was failing, or likely to fail, because of "significant deposit outflows" triggered by the Ukraine crisis." The European Central Bank stated the outflows "led to a deterioration of its liquidity position. And there are no available measures with a realistic chance of restoring this position." On 1 March 2022, the Austrian Financial Supervisory Authority (FMA) prohibited further operations.

On 2 March 2022, it was announced that Sberbank Europe Group is insolvent. On the same day the Slovenian subsidiary was sold to NLB Group, while the Croatian subsidiary was sold to Hrvatska poštanska banka.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, after the takeover from ASA banka and Nova Banka was allowed in March 2022 for two Bosnian Sberbank subsidiaries (*Sberbank a.d. Banja Luka* and *Sberbank BH d.d. Sarajevo*) continued to operate according to the rules of entity based banking regulators in BiH (FBA and ABRS). The Sarajevo based company was bought by ASA banka and operated under the name *ASA banka Naša i snažna d.d. Sarajevo* until the full integration with the parent ASA Banka, and the Banja Luka branch continued its operations (under Nova banka supervision) with the new presented name ATOS BANK a.d. Banja Luka.
