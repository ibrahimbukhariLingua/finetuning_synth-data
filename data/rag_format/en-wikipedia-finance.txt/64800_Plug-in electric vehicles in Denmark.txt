# Plug-in electric vehicles in Denmark



As of September 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, there were 97,121 battery electric vehicles and 97,071 plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in Denmark, together equivalent to about 7% of all vehicles in the country. As of August 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, 19.1% of all new cars sold in Denmark were fully electric, and 18.0% were plug-in hybrid.

In 2022, Denmark was ranked by Forbes as the third most EV-friendly country in the world.


## History

In the late 1980s to early 1990s, a few thousand of the small, one-person and locally produced *Ellert* were sold in Denmark, but relatively few remain today. In the following decade, very few electric cars were sold in Denmark, but a clear increase began around 2010.

Up to and including 2015, electric cars had been exempt from vehicle registration tax, but it was decided that this would be gradually outphased: In 2016, the vehicle registration tax for electric cars was placed at 20% of the normal rate, in 2017 it was planned to increase to 40% and within five years it would become the full rate. This had a large effect on the sale, which drastically fell in 2016–17. As a consequence, it was decided that the increase in vehicle registration tax for electric vehicles would be delayed, being capped at 20% of the normal rate in 2017–19, then gradually increasing until 2023 where it would become the full rate. A new fund for fuel cell vehicles was also started.

In 2020, a new taxation deal was reached, valid for all cars from 2021 to 2030. Its rates depend heavily on the CO₂-emission of the car. This means that vehicle registration tax for all-electric cars (BEVs) that cost less than 510,000 DKK (€68,500) will remain very low with a slower than initially planned gradual increase to normal levels, most plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) will increase from 2021 but remain lower than gasoline and diesel cars, and diesel cars will increase. The goal of this plan is to have at least 775,000 electric cars (BEV or PHEV) by 2030. Combined with other plans, it is the goal to have at least 1 million zero-emission or low-emission cars by 2030 and that no new gasoline or diesel cars will be sold in the country from that year.
