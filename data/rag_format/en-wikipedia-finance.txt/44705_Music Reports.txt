# Music Reports



**Music Reports** provides music rights licensing, administration, royalty accounting, and software development and hosting. Music Reports operates the largest registry of worldwide music rights and related business information.


## History

Music Reports was established to enable local television broadcasters seeking alternatives to the rigid blanket licensing structures offered by BMI and ASCAP. Music Reports developed an administration service to allow television composers to license television stations directly, pursuant to a collection, music usage information, processing of television station schedules and revenues, and automated report preparation and submission to the PROs of specific, granular music usage information.

Following the signing of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, Music Reports initiated a program of copyright licensing for digital music services including through a sister company called Royalty Logic, Inc. In doing so, the company played a significant role in the development of music streaming services, both interactive and non-interactive.

Music Reports provides services in the following areas:

* Administration of ASCAP, BMI and SESAC per program licenses for television broadcasters, cable networks, and streaming networks.
