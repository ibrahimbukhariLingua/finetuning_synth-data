## History

Cluttons traces its roots back to 1765, when William Clutton took over his father-in-law's surveying business in Sussex and began trading under his own name. One of his grandsons, John Clutton, moved to London in 1837 to found the London business.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Prior to 1877, Cluttons was operating at 33 Borough High Street, in Southwark, near London Bridge. John's brothers remained in Sussex to concentrate on the land agency business, which continues today as RH & RW Clutton, an entirely separate firm.

John Clutton, born in 1809, was a joint founder and the first president of the Surveyors’ Association (later the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He died in 1896, leaving the business to his successors, including four further generations of the Clutton family.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

After the Second World War, the firm opened a commercial office in Grosvenor Street, Mayfair.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The 1970s saw Cluttons expand into the Middle East.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Cluttons now has representation in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Bahrain and Oman.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Cluttons London Residential Agency (CLRA) was formed in 1992 by Robin Paterson after the acquisition of several Barnard Marcus London Offices and an office in Hong Kong. With funding from NatWest Ventures and Marco Polo Developments, a Singapore-based property investment company, CLRA opened new offices in London and Singapore over the next four years.

In 1997, Cluttons merged with Daniel Smith, another long-established (1775) traditional management and general practice partnership.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Daniel Smith's approximately 100 partners and staff brought the total complement of the combined firm to over 500 people.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
