Piedmontese scudo


# Piedmontese scudo



The **scudo** (plural: *scudi*) was the currency of the Piedmont and the other mainland parts of the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia until 1816.


## History

It was subdivided into 6 *lire* (singular: *lira*), each of 20 *soldi* or 240 *denari*. The *doppia* was worth 2 scudi. During the Subalpine Republic and French occupation (1800–1814), the French franc circulated, supplemented by a small number of locally produced coins. The scudo was replaced by the Sardinian lira.


## Coins

In the late 18th century, copper 2 denari, billon ½, 1, 2½ and 7½ soldi, silver ¼, ½ and 1 scudo, and gold ¼, ½, 1, and 2½ doppia coins circulated. In the 1790s, copper 1 and 5 soldi, and billon 10, 15 and 20 soldi were added.

The Piedmont Republic issued silver ¼ and ½ scudo in 1799. This was followed in 1800 by bronze 2 soldi struck in the name of the "Piedmont Nation" (*Nazione Piemontese*).
