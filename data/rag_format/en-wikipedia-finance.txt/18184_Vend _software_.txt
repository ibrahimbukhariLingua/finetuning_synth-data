The following year, Vend closed 20 million (20,000,000) US$25 million (25,000,000) in Series B funding. The funding round was co-led by Peter Thiel and Square Peg Capital in Australia. Later in 2014, the company also opened offices in Toronto and London. In August 2015, Vend announced that it had raised 12 million (12,000,000) NZD, mainly from existing investors along with new entrant Punakaiki Fund.

In 2015, Vend launched Vend Ecommerce. It also announced a partnership with UK payments provider iZettle, and North American payments provider Mercury (now Vantiv).

In 2016, the company partnered with Square to enable retailers who use Vend's software to process payments with Square.

In 2016 Vend also launched an app for inventory management named Counter.

At the end of 2016, Vend raised a further 9 million (9,000,000) US$13 million (13,000,000 NZD) led by existing investors, and with significant new investment from fund manager Movac. In 2016 Vend grew its UK staff to 20 and opened a new office in East London.

## Technology

Vend uses HTML5 features in Google Chrome and Safari to implement offline processing capabilities.

* A webSQL database built into the browser provides local inventory storage so sales can be processed offline and all stock levels updated.
* HTML5’s offline manifest tells the browser to take copies of certain files and pages for offline use.
* WebSocket (another element of HTML5) allows Vend to talk to other devices on a local network, interfacing with hardware such as an EFTPOS unit or other payment devices.

Vend works with mobile browsers as well as their iOS app called Vend Register.
