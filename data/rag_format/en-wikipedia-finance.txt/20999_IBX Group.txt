## History

IBX was established in October 2000, through an initiative from Ericsson, SEB, b-business partners and the founders. The founders are Hans Ahlinder, Björn Böhme, Christer Hallqvist and Peter Lageson. The initial period was used to set up an application environment and to implement the two first customers: Ericsson and SEB. As a part of this, IBX signed agreements with SAP and *Commerce One* in November 2000.

Since 2001, IBX is continuously growing and present in other North European countries: Denmark, Norway (2001) and Finland (2002). IBX takes another step on the European market, when the company signs a five-year agreement with Deutsche Post World Net.

In March 2005, IBX acquires the German e-commerce company *trimondo GmbH*. The acquisition establishes IBX in Europe. In August 2006, IBX acquires German *Portum AG*, a supplier of web-based solutions for strategic purchasing (E-sourcing).

IBX has 232 employees in offices around the world and has operations in more than 80 different countries. IBX operated at the following locations: Stockholm-Bromma (headquarters), Copenhagen-Vallensbæk Strand, Helsinki, Oslo, Kraków (service desk), Paris (Capgemini) and Chicago.

In 2017, IBX was acquired by Tradeshift creating "the world's largest business commerce platform connecting nearly 1.5 million businesses and more than 500 global enterprise customers that have access to the largest supply-chain app ecosystem".


## Solutions and Services

IBX provides software as a service purchasing technology based on their IBX On-demand Platform. The scalable on-demand delivery model of IBX software for sourcing and procurement accelerates deployment and puts the emphasis on the users and the usage instead of technology issues. The benefits of an on-demand delivery model include lower upfront costs, lower total cost of ownership or a fast return on investment. In 2010, IBX joined forces with Capgemini in order to deliver an end-to-end BPO procurement solution that is called Procurement as a Service.
