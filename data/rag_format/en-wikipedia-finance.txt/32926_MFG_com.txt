## Business Model

**Buyers of Custom Manufactured Parts**

Engineers and sourcing professionals use MFG.com to source custom manufactured parts, as well as find and connect with contract manufacturers and manufacturing job shops around the world. Buyers upload their requests for quotation (RFQs) online and connect with suppliers that meet their specific manufacturing specifications. Buyers have the ability to connect with job shops and contract manufacturers based on geographic location, certifications, and manufacturing capabilities. Buyers can also request job shops and contract manufacturers sign electronic non-disclosure agreement (NDA) forms so that they can control how, when, where, and by whom their drawings and documents are viewed.

Engineers and sourcing professionals can source custom parts in categories such as:

* Assembly
* Casting
* Extrusion
* Fabrication
* Forging
* Gears
* Machining
* Molding
* Rapid Prototyping
* Spring & Wire Forming
* Stamping
* Tube Modification
* Tool, Die, & Mold Making

**Providers of Contract Manufacturing Services**

Contract manufacturers, job shops, and suppliers of custom manufactured parts have full access to the RFQs being sourced by members of the MFG.com buyer community. Those providers of manufacturing services can search for RFQs based on factors like geography, category, material quantity, part size, or a combination of the four. A profile is created for the manufacturing services provider where they can be found by sourcing professionals on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. There is an annual subscription for job shops, suppliers, and contract manufacturers to use MFG.com.
