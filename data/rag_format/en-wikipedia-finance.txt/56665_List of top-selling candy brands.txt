Initially working from the basement of his Hershey, Pennsylvania home, Reese's success eventually allowed him to build two modern factories. Reese died on May 16, 1956, in West Palm Beach, Florida, leaving the company to his six sons. On July 2, 1963, the H. B. Reese Candy Company merged with the Hershey Chocolate Corporation in a tax free stock-for-stock merger. In 2024 after 61 years of stock splits, the original 666,316 shares of Hershey common stock received by the Reese brothers represent 16 million Hershey shares valued at over $4.4 billion that pay annual cash dividends of $87.6 million.
