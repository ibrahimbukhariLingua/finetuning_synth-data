## History

Bambora was founded as Beanstream, was founded in 2000 in Victoria, British Columbia, by entrepreneur and military veteran Craig Thomson. It was created to facilitate online payments, and quickly expanded into the United States as one of the first gateway payment systems in North America.

Bambora itself was founded in 2015 in Stockholm, Sweden, by Johan Tj√§rnberg. It began as an integration of four global payment-processing companies, including IP Payments (acquired in August 2015)and Beanstream (acquired in September 2015, but which, for marketing reasons, did not fully re-brand until 2017).

Two years later, Bambora was acquired by Ingenico Group of France, which subsequently merged with Worldline SA in late 2020. As of 2024, Bambora continued to operate under its own name for some time, but has since been rebranded as "a Worldline brand".
