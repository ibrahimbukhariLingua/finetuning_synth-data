She graduated from Osseo-Fairchild High School in 1965, and had been divorced from her first husband for ten years when she met Ken Hendricks.


## Career

In 1975, she was selling custom-built homes and Ken was a roofer’s son and high school dropout. They married and became business partners. In 1982, they used their lines of credit to secure a loan that enabled them to establish ABC Supply, the nation's largest wholesale distributor of roofing, windows, gutters, and siding for residential and commercial buildings.

## Tax controversies

Hendricks paid no state income tax in four of the five years from 2010 to 2014.

An investigation by Urban Milwaukee found that Hendricks's multi-story 8,500-square-foot home in the Town of Rock in Rock County, Wisconsin, had been assessed as a 1,663-square-foot ranch. Following the *Urban Milwaukee* investigation, Hendricks denied the tax assessor access to the property, citing "security reasons". After she agreed to supply the assessor with data on the home, the property's assessment was changed from $445,700 to $1,205,500.


## Personal life

Hendricks has seven children and lives in Afton, Wisconsin.
