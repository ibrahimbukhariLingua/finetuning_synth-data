# 333 Bush Street



**333 Bush Street** is a 43-floor, 151 m (495 ft) mixed-use skyscraper located on Bush Street in the Financial District of San Francisco, California. The building was completed in 1986 and was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and contains commercial offices as well as seven stories of individually owned residential condominiums. It is one of 39 San Francisco high rises reported by the U.S. Geological Survey as potentially vulnerable to a large earthquake, due to a flawed welding technique.


## Recent ownership history

In 2009, the tower's owners, Hines and Sterling American Property, forfeited ownership to their lenders after the primary tenant, multinational law firm Heller Ehrman filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on rent payments leaving property 65 percent vacant. In 2013, the building was purchased by a joint venture of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board and DivcoWest Properties for US$275 million. In 2015, the property was acquired by Tishman Speyer for US$380 million.
