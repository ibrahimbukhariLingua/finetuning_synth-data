**Calcala TV** (Hebrew: ערוץ הכלכלה) is an Israeli business television channel, the first of its kind in Israel, broadcasting from Bnei Brak. The channel is owned by Yitzchak Mirilashvili.


## History

In April 2024, economics reporter Maayan Prilock, formerly of Channel 12, was appointed for the planned business channel.

In July 2024, it was announced that Yitzhak Mirlashvili, owner of Channel 14, planned to launch a business network in the coming months. Appointed for their posts were editor-chief Eran Bar Tal and two presenters, Danny Rupp and the editor of Israel HaYom's business section, Sonia Gorodisky. Mirlashvili reiterated that the channel would have no affiliation with any pre-existing news channel, by having a separate editorial team. In September, it was announced that the channel would occupy channel 10 on subscription television operators.

The channel started broadcasting at 7:30pm on 1 January 2025 with a special two-hour program presented by Roi Katz. The channel's carriage is limited to OTT services and its initial supposition is possible alignment to the ruling government. On January 2, 2025, the channel aired its first full business day with the first broadcast from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Its website resembles that of i24 News, raising suspicions of its possible affiliation with the Bibist right.
