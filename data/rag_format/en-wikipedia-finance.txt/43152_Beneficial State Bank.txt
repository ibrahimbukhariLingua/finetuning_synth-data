# Beneficial State Bank



**Beneficial State Bank** (formerly One PacificCoast Bank, FSB; and OneCalifornia Bank) is an Oakland, California-based community development bank. The bank was founded in 2007 by billionaire philanthropist and former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and his wife Kat Taylor, to provide loans and banking services to individuals in low wealth communities, including entrepreneurs and existing businesses.


## History

In June 2007, Tom Steyer and his wife Kat Taylor founded a charitable foundation, OneCalifornia Foundation, with $22.5 million. As part of the foundation, they formed OneCalifornia Bank as a non-profit community bank. Their goal when founding the bank and foundation was to finance non-profit organizations, and ensure profits were reinvested in the community.

In August 2010, the bank signed an agreement to acquire ShoreBank Pacific, a Ilwaco, Washington-based community bank, and subsidiary of Shorebank Chicago. Together the merged banks would have $300 million in combined assets and serve California, Oregon and Washington. As part of the acquisition, OneCalifornia Bank changed its name to One PacificCoast Bank.

In January 2013, One PacificCoast Bancorp announced plans to acquire 90% of the stock of Portland, Oregon-based Albina Community Bank. In September, the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors approved One PacificCoast Bancorp and its parent One PacificCoast Foundation's request for One PacificCoast Bank, FSB and newly acquired Albina Community Bank to merge. The merger was completed in October.

In July 2014, One PacificCoast Bank rebranded to become Beneficial State Bank, to reflect the bank's stated purpose to pursue "economic justice and environmental sustainability". The parent foundation was renamed to Beneficial State Foundation.
