Allied Stores


# Allied Stores



**Allied Stores** was a holding company of department store chains in the United States. It was founded in the 1930s as part of a general consolidation in the retail sector by B. E. Puckett. See also Associated Dry Goods. It was the successor to **Hahn's Department Stores**, a holding company founded in 1928.

In 1981, Allied Stores acquired the 24-year-old retail conglomerate Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads, Inc. for $228 million (~$647 million in 2023). With that transaction they acquired 178 department stores and 48 specialty shops in 28 states.

In December 1986, Allied Stores was acquired by Campeau Corporation under Canadian entrepreneur Robert Campeau. In April 1988, Campeau merged with Federated Department Stores. Allied and Federated were consolidated in January 1990 after Chapter 11 bankruptcy though they remained two distinct companies. Federated absorbed Allied when emerging from bankruptcy in February 1992.
