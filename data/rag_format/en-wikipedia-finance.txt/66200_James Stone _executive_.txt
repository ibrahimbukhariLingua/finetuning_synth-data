## Early life and education

James M. (Jim) Stone was born in New York City in 1947. His father was an attorney and a poet, and his mother, Babette Rosmond, was an author and also the fiction editor of Seventeen magazine. His younger brother is the writer Gene Stone. Stone was educated in the public schools of Pelham, New York, and at Harvard University. In 1969, Stone received his bachelor's degree, graduating with Highest Honors in Economics, and was elected a member to Phi Beta Kappa.

## Career

While teaching at Harvard, Stone consulted in the insurance industry on a part-time basis. During this period, he completed six examinations for admission to the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS), and his 1973 paper on the insurance of catastrophic risk became a standard requirement of the CAS syllabus.

In 1975, Stone was appointed Insurance Commissioner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by Governor Michael S. Dukakis. In 1979, Stone was appointed chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by President Jimmy Carter. Stoneâ€™s CFTC tenure was controversial due to his calls for tight position limits, enhanced disclosure, and high margin requirements to reduce leverage in derivative markets. The trading profession and his fellow Commissioners dismissed his assertions that the burgeoning scale of speculative derivatives could prove destabilizing for the economy as a whole. In 1983, Stone finished his term in Washington at the CFTC and returned to Boston. In 1982, he founded Plymouth Rock Assurance Corporation. He has been the group's CEO since its establishment.
