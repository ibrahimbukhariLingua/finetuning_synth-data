# International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network



The **International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network** (**ICPEN**), formerly the **International Marketing Supervision Network** (**IMSN**), is a global network of consumer protection authorities which engages in dispute resolution and encourages cooperation between law enforcement agencies for disputes arising from commerce across international borders. Many members are also members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).


## History
