Contour Airlines


# Contour Airlines



**Contour Airlines** is an independent regional airline headquartered at Smyrna Airport in Smyrna, Tennessee, United States.

Contour Airlines is set up as a public charter operator for regulatory purposes and does not directly operate aircraft. Contour Airlines charters 30-seat regional jets operated by its parent company, Contour Aviation, then resells seats on those aircraft to the public. The arrangement allows Contour to utilize pilots who are qualified to operate charter services, who can be either less experienced or older than allowed on commercial passenger flights.


## History

Contour Airlines was established by its parent company Contour Aviation in 2016. Contour began service on March 22, 2016, completing its inaugural flight from Nashville to Tupelo, Mississippi. On April 1, 2019, Contour retired its Jetstream 31/32 fleet and focused solely on ERJ-135/145 aircraft.

On February 5, 2020, Contour Airlines announced that it would add Indianapolis as a focus city and purchase additional ERJ-135/145 aircraft. The goal was to provide efficient service to markets within driving distance but without direct flights to capture travelers who would rather drive than fly with a layover. The airline planned to serve Nashville, Pittsburgh and St. Louis from Indianapolis beginning June 10, 2020, however, the service had been suspended indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 28, 2021, Contour announced its relaunch in Indianapolis, beginning on October 12 and flying to Milwaukee, Nashville, and Pittsburgh. However, Contour quietly dropped Milwaukee and Pittsburgh less than three months later. According to Contour CEO Matt Chaifetz, the Indianapolis to Milwaukee route averaged 40% full and was climbing, but stalled in the winter due to fears over the omicron variant. He said "the timing was just poor" for the new routes but said, "We're still committed to Indianapolis."

In early 2024, regional carrier SkyWest Airlines purchased a 25% ownership stake in Contour Airlines to gain access to its infrastructure, personnel, and operational expertise as it launches its own Part 135 operation, SkyWest Charter. SkyWest also plans to supply Contour with CRJ200 aircraft and partner with the airline to both recruit young pilots and provide opportunities to pilots who would otherwise need to retire due to age.

On October 1, 2024, Contour changed multiple routes to new American Airlines hubs. Altoona used to connect to Philadelphia but now connects to Charlotte. Fort Leonard Wood and Cape Girardeau changed from Nashville to Chicago.

In January 2025, Contour appointed Ben Munson as President. He will report to CEO Matt Chaifetz.
