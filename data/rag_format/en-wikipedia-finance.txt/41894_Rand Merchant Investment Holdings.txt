**Rand Merchant Investment** **Holdings**, also referred to as **RMI Holdings**, is a listed financial services investment holding company that holds various insurance brands in South Africa, Australia, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.


## Overview

RMI Holdings is listed on the JSE and insurance and investment products and services to retail, commercial, corporate and public sector customers. The group has its headquarters in Sandton, South Africa.


## History

RMI Holdings was incorporated and registered in South Africa on 24 March 2010 as a wholly owned subsidiary of RMB Holdings. On 7 March 2011, RMB Holdings (RMBH)*,* Remgro and FirstRand span off their insurance assets to RMI Holdings and separately listing it on the JSE.


### RMB Holdings Restructure

The RMB Holdings restructure was announced on 10 December 2010. Its aim was to create separate focused insurance and banking entities. Prior to the restructure RMB Holdings portfolio comprised

* FirstRand – 30% Shareholding.
* OUTsurance – 58.5% Shareholding – RMB Holdings held 45% of OUTsurance directly and an additional 45% through FirstRand bring the total control to 58.5%.
* Momentum Metropolitan Holdings – 18% Shareholding.
* Discovery – 25% Shareholding.
* RMB-Structured Insurance – 76% Shareholding.

The restructure was aimed at separating of RMBH's insurance and banking interests and was executed as follows:

* The transfer of the RMBH, Remgro and FirstRand's insurance interests to its newly incorporated wholly owned subsidiary, RMI Holdings. These insurance assets were transferred in exchange of additional shares in RMI Holdings.
* The unbundling of RMBH's shares in RMI Holdings to RMBH shareholders and the separate listing of RMI Holdings on the JSE by way of introduction. RMI Holdings would then become an insurance-focused investment entity.

### Post Restructure

The RMBH restructure was completed on 7 March 2011 and the shares of RMIH started trading at the JSE on the same day. This restructure was made possible due to the common shareholding in RMB Holding, Remgro and FirstRand. However, to date RMB Holdings and RMI Holdings share the same management team and resources under a management contract.

In January 2016, the firm changed its name to Rand Merchant Investment Holdings. This was in line with the firm's strategy to invest in the broader financial services sector and beyond the insurance industry. In the same year, RMI Holdings announced that it would be selling its entire shareholding in RMB-SI to Santam.

In 2022, RMIH holding embarked on a restructure of its operations. This involved the unbundling its entire stake in Discovery Limited and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings Limited to its shareholders and the sale of its stake Hastings Group Holdings plc. The company also resolved to change its name to OUTsurance Group.
