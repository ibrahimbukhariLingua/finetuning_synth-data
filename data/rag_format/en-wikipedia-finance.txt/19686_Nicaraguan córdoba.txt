Nicaraguan córdoba


# Nicaraguan córdoba



The **córdoba** (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkordoβa], sign: **C$**; code: **NIO**) is the currency of Nicaragua and is divided into 100 *centavos*.


## History

The first córdoba was introduced with the new National Bank of Nicaragua (Banco Nacional de Nicaragua Incorporado) which was created in 1912, after which the government of Adolfo Díaz promulgated the Monetary Conversion Law, in March 1912. This law created the monetary unit "córdoba", named after Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, founder of Nicaragua and the cities of León and Granada, but due to the prevailing political instability at that time, the Córdoba did not circulate until 1913. It replaced the peso moneda corriente, the Nicaraguan currency between 1878 and 1912.

In 1960 the Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) was founded and the banknotes and coins that until that date were issued by the National Bank of Nicaragua, began to be issued by the central bank.

From 1979 onwards, a period characterised by high inflation began, which caused the currency to lose value and led to the currency exchange and conversion operation of 14 February 1988, in which the córdoba, under the Sandinista regime's "Operation Berta" (Operación Berta), was replaced by the "new córdoba" (córdoba nuevo) at an exchange rate of 1,000 to 1. In the period 1988-1990, the period of high inflation continued, which led to the córdoba nuevo being replaced by the córdoba oro, with parity against the US dollar. In 1992, the "cordoba" was established and persists to this day.


## Coins


### First córdoba

In 1912, coins were introduced in denominations of 1⁄2, 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos and 1 córdoba. The 1⁄2 and 1 centavo were minted in bronze, the 5 centavos in cupro-nickel and the higher denominations in silver. The 1 córdoba was only minted in 1912, whilst 1⁄2 centavo production ceased in 1937.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1939, cupro-nickel replaced silver on the 10, 25, and 50 centavos. In 1943, a single year issue of brass 1, 5, 10, and 25 centavos was made. These were the last 1 centavo coins. In 1972, cupro-nickel 1 córdoba coins were issued, followed, in 1974, by aluminium 5 and 10 centavos.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

A new series of coins, featuring a portrait of Augusto César Sandino, was introduced in 1981, consisting of aluminum 5 and 10 centavos, nickel-clad steel 25 centavos and cupro-nickel 50 centavos, 1 and 5 córdobas. Nickel clad steel replaced cupro nickel between 1983 and 1984. In 1987, the final coins of the 1st córdoba were issued, featuring Sandino's characteristic hat. Aluminum 500 córdobas were issued.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The 25 and 50 centavo coins, along with 1 córdoba coins, minted in 1985 were mostly recalled and destroyed by the Central Bank. A few of the 1 córdoba were circulated as seen.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Second córdoba

No coins were issued for this currency.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Third córdoba (córdoba oro)

In 1991, coins dated 1987 but actually introduced with that year's re-denomination, in denominations of 5, 10, and 25 centavos and aluminum-bronze 50 centavos. 1 and 5 córdobas were issued.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1994, coins were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos. All were minted in chrome-plated steel. In 1997, nickel-clad steel 50 centavos, 1 and 5 córdobas were introduced, followed by copper-plated steel 5 centavos and brass-plated steel 10 and 25 centavos in 2002 and brass-plated steel 10 córdobas in 2007.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Banknotes


### First córdoba

In 1912, the National Bank of Nicaragua introduced notes for 10, 25, and 50 centavos, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 córdobas, together with old half- and 1-peso moneda corriente notes overprinted for 4 and 8 centavos of the new currency. In 1934, all circulating banknotes were exchanged for notes which had been overprinted with "REVALIDO" ("revalidated"). The last notes for less than 1 córdoba were dated 1938. In 1945, 500-córdoba notes were introduced, followed by 1,000-córdoba notes in 1953.

In 1962, the Central Bank of Nicaragua took over paper money issuance by a bank resolution of 8 February 1962 and executive decree No. 71 of 26 April 1962. The 1-córdoba notes were replaced by coins in 1972. After 5-córdoba coins were introduced in 1981, 2 and 5-córdoba notes were withdrawn. In 1987, 5000-córdoba notes were introduced, followed by overprinted 10,000 (on 10), 20,000 (on 20), 50,000 (on 50), 100,000 (on 100), 100,000 (on 500), 200,000 (on 1,000), 500,000 (on 1,000), and 1,000,000 (on 1,000) córdobas notes as inflation drastically reduced the córdoba's value.


### Second córdoba

The second córdoba was only issued in banknote form. Notes (dated 1985) were issued in 1988 in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 córdobas together with undated 5000 córdobas. In 1989, notes for 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 córdobas were introduced, followed the next year by 200,000, 500,000, 1 million, 5 million, and 10 million córdobas notes.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Third córdoba (córdoba oro)

In 1991, notes were introduced for 1, 5, 10, and 25 centavos, 1⁄2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 córdobas. The notes below 1 córdoba were replaced by coins in 1994, with 5 córdobas notes also being replaced in 1997. 500 córdobas notes were introduced in 2002.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Famous people from Nicaragua's history are depicted on the obverses of the current banknotes. The reverses depict landmarks or natural habitats in the country.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### 2009 series

On May 15, 2009, polymer ten and twenty córdoba notes were issued to circulate alongside their paper counterparts. A new polymer two hundred and a paper one hundred córdoba banknote was first issued on June 1, 2009. A new polymer 50 córdoba was issued on December 3, 2009. The new designed paper 500 córdoba banknote was introduced on January 12, 2010. A commemorative design of the 50 córdobas was introduced on September 15, 2010, to commemorate the Banco Central de Nicaragua's 50th anniversary of its establishment. In 2012, the Banco Central de Nicaragua (Central Bank of Nicaragua) began issuing a new series of córdoba banknotes with revised security features, beginning with the 10, 20, and 200 córdoba polymer banknotes, which is similar to their first issue, but the notable change is the embossed "10", "20", and "200" on the see-through window now being of an opaque white.

The 100 córdoba banknote was also revised. The notable differences from the first issue is that the note was issued on the 100th anniversary of the córdoba currency. Also notable is the wider security thread, a revised registration device, a repositioned serial number, subtle underprint design changes and the commemorative text "1912-2012 Centenario del Cordoba" in pearlescent ink at the left front of the note. The 500 córdoba banknote was also revised. The most notable change for the note is the bank logo patch, now a holographic patch instead of an optically variable device and a wider security thread.
