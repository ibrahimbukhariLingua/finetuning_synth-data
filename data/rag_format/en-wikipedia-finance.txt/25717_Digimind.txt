## History

Digimind was founded in 1998 by Paul Vivant, Patrice Fran√ßois, Gerald Navarette and Romain Laboisse in Grenoble, France. Within a year, they launched vStrat, a collaborative market intelligence software tool for Lotus Notes (now IBM Notes). This was followed by the release of Strategic Finder, a meta search engine, in 1999. By the end of 1999, the software had reached over 60,000 users.

In 2003 the company launched Digimind Evolution, a competitive intelligence software application. The company's subsequent success and expansion in both French- and English-speaking markets facilitated the opening of a Research & Development centre in Rabat, Morocco in 2006, and an office in Cambridge, MA in 2008. In 2007, Digimind launched Digimind 7, an application providing real-time visual analysis of news stories.
