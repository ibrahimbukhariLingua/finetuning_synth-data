By 2000, it had grown from a real estate consulting firm to the No. 1 developer of healthcare facilities in the United States.


## History

Hammes Company was founded by Jon D. Hammes in 1991 as a real estate consulting firm. By December 1993, Hammes had five partners who watched over $100 million in property development and $25 million in corporate, public sector, and hospital facility development in five Midwestern states. In the mid-1990s, Hammes Company sought other development work in the sports industry, creating Hammes Company Sports Development, Inc. This sports and entertainment division developed the University of Wisconsin–Madison's basketball and hockey arena, the Kohl Center. By 2003, Hammes had been ranked the No. 1 developer of health care facilities in the United States for the fourth consecutive year.

In January 2007, Hammes Co. purchased a majority interest in Health Inventures, a developer and manager of ambulatory surgery centers, surgical hospitals and diagnostic imaging centers worldwide. The acquisition expanded the presence of Hammes Co. from the United States into European markets. In June 2008, Hammes Co. agreed to manage the development of a new hospital in the New Orleans area, the first since Hurricane Katrina devastated the region.

In the sports development unit, they have worked on the Kohl Center at UW–Madison and served as the construction manager for the $295 million renovation of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Hammes Company also was the project manager for the new $1.6 billion MetLife stadium for the New York Giants and the New York Jets in New Jersey. The stadium seats 80,000 fans and opened for the 2010 season.

Hammes Company has worked with several healthcare providers, including Aurora Health Care's new $189 million hospital in Summit, Wisconsin, and Inova Health System's 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m²) medical office building in northern Virginia. Hammes Company also belongs to the Society for Healthcare Strategy and Market Development.

In 2018, Foxconn Technology Group selected Hammes Company to develop master plans for the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park (WVSTP) in Racine County, Milwaukee.

In 2019, Nancy Connelly was named president, and Aimee Fogarty as vice president. In August of that same year, the company added Operational Readiness to its services platform.
