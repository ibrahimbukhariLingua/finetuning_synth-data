New Jersey Business and Industry Association


# New Jersey Business and Industry Association



The **New Jersey Business & Industry Association** (NJBIA) is an employer association that provides information, services, and advocacy for its member companies. It is the nation's largest state employer association with 20,000 member companies, as of 2015.


## Origins and history

NJBIA was founded as the Manufacturers Association of the State of New Jersey in January 1910 by a group of 8 mill owners who wanted to share ideas about workplace safety. One of the chief concerns of the association's founding members was the Employer's Liability Act. In 1911, the association formed the New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Liability Co., with the goal of providing for the medical care of injured workers, as well as giving employers steady rates and incentives to keep their workplaces safe.

In 1933 the association split into two separate, but closely affiliated, entities â€“ New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company and the New Jersey Manufacturers Association. In the years following the Great Depression, the association began to focus its efforts on advisory services in addition to advocacy for businesses in government. The association's Industrial Relations Department was formed in 1946 to provide members with advice and information about state and federal regulations. Policy committees developed by the association in 1960 brought together members interested in specific policy areas and shaped the association's agenda.

In the mid 1970s the association changed its name to the New Jersey Business & Industry Association. The change came as the association evolved into its current form, with an increased focus on lobbying the state government in the interest of business owners.

Michele N. Siekerka became NJBIA's 11th President in 2014.


## Membership

NJBIA has 20,000 member businesses of all sizes, including large national corporations with branches or interest in New Jersey. A large percentage of the association's members are small businesses, with 80% of their members having 24 or fewer employees. The association's annual dues are determined by the number of full-time equivalent employees a member has working in New Jersey.
