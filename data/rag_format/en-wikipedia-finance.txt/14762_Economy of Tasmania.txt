### Fresh produce

The Tasmanian fresh produce sector is a significant contributor to the state's economy, particularly in regional areas. In the 2018–19 period, the sector's direct economic contribution was valued at **$270 million**, with an additional **$66.7 million** in indirect contributions, resulting in a total economic impact of $336.7 million. This accounts for approximately 11% of Tasmania's total agricultural value and 1.1% of the state's overall economy.

Employment in the sector is substantial, with 2,708 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions directly linked to fresh produce activities. An additional 349 FTEs are supported indirectly, bringing the total employment impact to 3,057 FTEs.

The economic breakdown of the major fresh produce categories is as follows:

* **Berries**: **$125.3 million**
* **Vegetables**: **$78.7 million**
* **Cherries**: **$37.3 million**
* **Apples**: **$28.7 million**

The sector plays a particularly important role in regional communities, contributing to economic activity and employment. However, challenges such as workforce availability and freight logistics have been identified as potential constraints to future growth.

Infrastructure developments, including a $130 million upgrade to Hobart Airport's runway, are expected to enhance export opportunities by facilitating direct flights to Southeast Asia. These improvements are anticipated to reduce transit times and improve access to key international markets.

The Tasmanian fresh produce industry remains a vital component of the state’s agricultural economy, with ongoing efforts to address industry challenges and capitalise on opportunities for growth.
