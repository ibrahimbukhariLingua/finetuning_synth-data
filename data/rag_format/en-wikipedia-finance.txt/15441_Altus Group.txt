## History


### 2005–2011: Inception under Gary Yeoman

Altus Group went public in 2005, through the merger of three Canadian commercial real estate consultancies, one of which was led by its first CEO, Gary Yeoman. Altus initially listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as an income trust and subsequently converted into a corporation when the Canadian federal government implemented new taxes on trust distributions in 2011. The company originally focused on consulting services for the commercial real estate industry but over the years has also repositioned itself as a technology company to help clients manage their commercial real estate portfolios.

In 2006, Altus Group expanded into the land surveying industry in Western Canada which formed its Geomatics business segment. The Geomatics business was subsequently spun off in 2020, into the private company called GeoVerra that combined Altus Group’s Geomatics business with WSP’s geomatics operations.

In its first five years, the company expanded through acquisitions. These acquisitions primarily focused on the company’s property tax business. Altus Group’s property tax practice expanded into the UK market in 2007, with the acquisition of Edwin Hill. Expansion in the UK continued, including through the acquisition of Commercial Valuers & Surveyors (CVS) in 2017. Starting in 2010, the company also grew its property tax practice in the US, mainly through the acquisitions of Brazos Tax in 2010, Complex Property Advisors in 2013, and SC&H Group’s State & Local Tax Practice in 2014. The company also expanded its cost consulting practice to the Asia Pacific region through the acquisition of Page Kirkland in 2009.

The firm's shift to technology began with the acquisition of Argus Software in 2011. The current Altus Analytics business segment includes software, data solutionsᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ, and advisory offerings, including PricewaterhouseCoopers’s valuation management practice that was acquired in 2010. Acquiring ARGUS Software marked the first time that Altus Group entered the commercial real estate software industry.


### 2011–2020: Expansion into software and data under Robert Courteau

In 2011, Gary Yeoman stepped down as CEO and in 2012, Robert Courteau joined as the new CEO. He had previously served as president of SAP North America, an enterprise application software company. Under Courteau's leadership, the company continued its expansion into software. In 2014, it acquired Voyanta, a data management SaaS solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for CRE investors, and in 2018, it acquired Taliance, a provider of modelling and forecasting tools for CRE investors. In 2019, it launched a cloud-supported version of its Argus Enterprise product, used as an asset and investment management platform by the commercial real estate industry.


### 2020–present: "Intelligence as a service" strategy under Mike Gordon & Jim Hannon

In September 2020, Courteau retired and was succeeded as CEO by Mike Gordon. Gordon was previously CEO of Callcredit Information Group, a U.K.-based provider of consumer data for businesses. Under Gordon, the firm adopted an "intelligence as a service" strategy, focused on providing solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for managing the performance and risk of CRE assets. In 2021, it acquired two CRE data analytics providers: Stratodem, and Reonomy. It also acquired Finance Active, a provider of debt management software.

Jim Hannon, previously president of Altus Analytics, succeeded Mike Gordon as CEO on April 1, 2022.
