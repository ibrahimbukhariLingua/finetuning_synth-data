## Production

The series was greenlit by HBO on March 10, 2020 for its first season. According to The Wall Street Journal, *Wahl Street* was one of the "first business documentaries to emerge from the COVID-19 shutdown" and continued to keep the production going in the months of lockdown.

The series premiered on April 15, 2021. In August 2021, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered in October 2022.


## Reception

The Chicago Sun Times called the series "entertaining" and Vox noted the show is a "...dive into what it’s like to be a celebrity who is also trying to have a hand in a bunch of businesses when a pandemic hits." The Wall Street Journal published that "*[Wahl Street]* is a survival story whose themes many business owners will recognize after the losses of the past year." In The Hollywood Reporter, HBO Max noted the series is an "intimate exploration behind the drive that makes Mark Wahlberg one of the most unique stars in entertainment." Boston.com mentioned that the show "makes reference to HBO's former hit series Entourage," the hit television series and movie that was produced by Wahlberg and inspired by his early career in the media industry while allowing viewers to meet the "characters that make up Marky Mark's real-life entourage."
