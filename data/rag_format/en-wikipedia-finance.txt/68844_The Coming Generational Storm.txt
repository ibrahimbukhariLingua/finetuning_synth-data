# The Coming Generational Storm



***The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need to Know about America's Economic Future*** (2004) is a book by Laurence J. Kotlikoff and Scott Burns.

In the Prologue on page xii, the authors say the United States was "heading into one God-awful fiscal storm, the full dimensions of which are hard to fathom." Further, they say on page xiii the book offers suggestions for United States public policy and personal finance to help deflect the "storm". Moreover, they state:

"Averting America's Bankruptcy with a New New Deal", published by *The Economists' Voice* - February 2006, outlined some of the solutions promoted in the book. Kotlikoff also discusses his book in the Tax Foundation's podcast titled "Laurence J. Kotlikoff on Long-Term Fiscal Problems in the U.S.".
