* article 4, payment of employees’ outstanding claims resulting from contracts of employment or employment relationships, including, where provided for by national law, severance pay on termination of employment relationships. The claims taken over by the guarantee institution shall be the outstanding pay claims relating to a period prior to and/or, as applicable, after a given date determined by the Member States.’

In the United Kingdom, the relevant implementing legislation is found in the Employment Rights Act 1996. Under section 166 any employee may lodge a claim with the National Insurance Fund for outstanding wages.
