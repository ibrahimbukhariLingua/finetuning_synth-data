Amoroso–Robinson relation


# Amoroso–Robinson relation



The **Amoroso–Robinson relation**, named after economists Luigi Amoroso and Joan Robinson, describes the relation between price, marginal revenue, and price elasticity of demand.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial R}{\partial x}}=p\left(1+{\frac {1}{\epsilon \_{x,p}}}\right)},

where

* {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {\partial R}{\partial x}}} is the marginal revenue,
* {\displaystyle x} is the particular good,
* {\displaystyle p} is the good's price,
* {\displaystyle \epsilon \_{x,p}<0} is the price elasticity of demand.

## Extension and generalization

In 1967, Ernst Lykke Jensen published two extensions, one deterministic, the other probabilistic, of Amoroso–Robinson's formula.
