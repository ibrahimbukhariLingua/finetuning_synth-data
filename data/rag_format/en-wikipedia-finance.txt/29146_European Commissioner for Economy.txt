# European Commissioner for Economy



The **European Commissioner for Economy** is a member of the European Commission. The current Economy Commissioner is Valdis Dombrovskis.

From 2014 to 2019 the post was named *Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs*. Until 2014 the post was named *Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud* and was previously divided prior to 2010, with audit being under control of the Commissioner for Administrative Affairs. The post was abolished in 2014, when the Juncker Commission merged the post with that of the Economic and Financial Affairs portfolio.

The post is responsible for the EU's customs union and taxation policy. The European Union has had a customs union since the creation of the European Economic Community and that union extends to Turkey, Andorra and San Marino. Since 2010 it gained responsibility for audit (budgetary discharge, internal audit, counter fraud): in particular the Internal Audit Service and the European Anti-fraud Office.
