### Ambassador to the UK

During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, a plenary session of Venezuela's National Assembly endorsed acting president Juan Guaidó's appointment of Neumann as his Ambassador and Chief of Mission to the Court of St. James (the UK).

Neumann was a central figure in a landmark trial on who controls Venezuela's national gold reserves held at the Bank of England (Nicolás Maduro or Juan Guaidó) that took place in London's High Court, 22–25 June 2020. On the day the trial started, Neumann stated clearly the purpose of the trial: “The gold in the vaults in the Bank of England is our national reserves. It belongs to our people, to secure our nation’s future.” On 2 July 2020, Justice Nigel Teare issued his decision: Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom "unequivocally" recognizes Juan Guaidó as the president of Venezuela. In *The Wall Street Journal*, Juan Guaidó stated: “This is a grand victory for us in the area of international law," and Neumann stated: "It’s a national reserve, it’s safeguarded for the future, for the reconstruction of the country in the democratic system.” To the *Financial Times,* Neumann declared: "The verdict is a victory for the people of Venezuela and for the rule of law more generally. It highlights the importance of a judiciary that is independent and non-political." On 5 July 2020, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II sent a letter to Juan Guaidó congratulating the Venezuelan people on their Independence Day celebrations.
