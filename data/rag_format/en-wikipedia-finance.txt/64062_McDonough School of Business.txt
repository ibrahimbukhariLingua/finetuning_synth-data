## History

The school was founded in 1957 as an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service, and was originally named the Georgetown University School of Business Administration. In 1993, the name was changed to the Georgetown University School of Business.

The new building includes 15 classrooms, eight case-style rooms, five tiered lecture rooms, and two flat-floor rooms; 34 breakout rooms complete with data ports, flat-screen video monitors, and white boards; separate undergraduate and graduate commons areas and lockers for graduate students; 120 faculty offices; 11 interview rooms within the Career Management Office; 15 conference rooms throughout the building; and a 400-seat auditorium, among other features.


## Academics

Several academic themes distinguish the McDonough School of Business and give the school a special identity among managers and academicians, including international and intercultural dimensions of the marketplace, the importance of written and oral communication, and interpersonal effectiveness in organizations. As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown stresses ethics and social justice in its curriculum.

The Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research is one of several academic research centers at the McDonough School of Business.

The McDonough School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.


## Undergraduate school

Undergraduates work toward a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA). The curriculum combines business and liberal arts courses. The primary academic emphasis during the first and second years is the liberal arts, including economics, government, history, philosophy, English, calculus, and theology.

The McDonough School of Business has core courses in the traditional disciplines of accounting, finance, marketing, management, and the decision sciences support these themes. Additionally these themes are supported by the school's support of minor concentrations among nearly 50 liberal arts disciplines. Undergraduate concentrations include accounting, finance, international business, management, marketing, and operations and information management (OPIM). The school's undergraduate acceptance rate in the 2009–2010 cycle was 22 percent, but dropped to 15.7 percent for the 2014–2015 cycle, where the school accepted 530 applicants out of roughly 3,375 applicants.


### Student groups, activities, and employment

The Undergraduate Program Office and active students provide dozens of activities and groups. Some activities include the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund, Georgetown University Accounting Society, Innovo Consulting, Hilltop Consultants, Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity, Young Alumni Mentor Program, Stock Pitch Competition, and other activities.

The school also offers six-week summer study-abroad programs tailored specifically for business students at the University of Oxford, Sophia University in Tokyo, and the ESADE Business School.
