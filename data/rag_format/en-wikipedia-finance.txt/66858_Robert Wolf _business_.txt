Wolf considered himself a close ally of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential Campaign calling himself “a non-surrogate surrogate” and “[…] someone that has the good fortune of being able to email Secretary Clinton, [Clinton campaign chairman] John Podesta and [senior policy adviser] Jake Sullivan directly on things I’m thinking and ideas […] I give them my best ideas, and I feel at times honored that they decide to listen to them."

In a 2016 profile in The Hill Wolf supported Hillary Clinton’s fiscally conservative plans and said conservatives should have voted for her: “My view is a lot of the business community will support the secretary because her business policies are better.” Asserting that most of the business world “lean left socially and lean right fiscally,” he said “I think when you look at leaning right fiscally, if you look at her plan versus Trump’s,” Clinton’s comes out on top. Wolf also defended Wall Street saying, “Wall Street are Americans just like everyone else. Please don’t stereotype us. We vote for a lot of different reasons, and I would actually say regulation is the least reason we vote because we know regulation is here.”
