## Background

The report follows on from "The State of the World's Cash Report", a seminal piece published by CALP in 2018*.*

The report reflects on progress made against global policy commitments made by the Grand Bargain, ECHO's 10 Principles, the High Level Panel on Cash and the World Bank's Strategic Note on Cash Transfers in Humanitarian Contexts among others. These and other policy commitments are summarised in the Global Framework for Action: A Consolidated Summary of Commitments for Cash Transfer Programming which provides the overall structure to the State of the World's Cash Report with additional chapters to reflect new trends and issues.

This document is widely cited and used both by policy makers and practitioners. It is a source referenced in the annual review of progress against Grand Bargain commitments and in multiple other authoritative research, policy and guidance reports.
