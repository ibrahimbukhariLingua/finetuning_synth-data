Capitol Music Group


# Capitol Music Group



**Capitol Music Group** is an American front-line umbrella label operating as a unit of Interscope Capitol Labels Group, itself a division of Universal Music Group. Inherited from UMG's acquisition of EMI's catalog in 2013, it oversees the handling of record labels assigned to UMG's Capitol Records division. The current chair and CEO is Tom March.


## History


### 2007-10: Formation and success

Capitol Music Group was formed in February 2007 as a merger of Capitol Records and Virgin Records America in an effort by EMI to restructure and save an average of $217 million yearly. Both Virgin Records and Capitol Records, however, remained imprints of the label.

Virgin Records CEO Jason Flom was named the head of the division, with Capitol Records CEO Andy Slater resigning after receiving a pension reportedly worth more than $15 million. As the head of the label, Flom reported directly to EMI Group CEO Eric Nicoli.

A total of 283 artists signed to Capitol Music Group, including Mims, LeToya Luckett, J. Holiday, Royal Bliss, Mack 10, Faith Evans, Fat Joe, and since 2007, Katy Perry, Barbara Pravi, Paul McCartney, Duncan Laurence, Calum Scott, Ferras, and Rucka Rucka Ali. In 2014 both Morrissey and Neil Diamond were confirmed to have signed with Capitol Records, Morrissey having signed a two-album deal. However, the latter was given to Parlophone as a result of that label's sale to Warner Music.


### 2010-13: Spinoff from Virgin Records and reorganization

In 2010, Virgin Records was spun off from Capitol Music Group to form Virgin Music Group; as of 2013, however, the Virgin Music Group was dissolved, resulting in Virgin Records returning to its placement under CMG.


### 2012-21: Closure of EMI and UMG acquisition

In November 2012, it was announced that Steve Barnett would become the chairman and CEO of the company.

With EMI's absorption (sans Parlophone) into Universal Music Group complete, Capitol Music Group is now part of UMG's five label units in the UK. The Beatles have been confirmed to appear on Capitol UK.

In April 2013, Robbie McIntosh was named head of Capitol's international operations.

In November 2016, the company's chairman and CEO Steve Barnett announced that the company has three endeavors planned out that include music, film and literary projects that pay tribute to eight decades' worth of artists signed to the label.

In November 2020, Jeff Vaughn was named new Chairman/CEO, replacing Steve Barnett.

In December 2021, Michelle Jubelirer was promoted to chair and CEO of Capitol Music Group. She reported to Universal Music Group chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge.


### 2024-present: Interscope Capitol Labels Group

In early 2024, after Grainge announced a restructuring that would see Capitol operate under the same umbrella with Interscope Geffen A&M, Jubelirer left her post and was replaced by former Geffen head Tom March, who reports to ICLG chair John Janick. As a result both CMG and IGA combined their operations into a new Universal Music label unit, Interscope Capitol Labels Group.
