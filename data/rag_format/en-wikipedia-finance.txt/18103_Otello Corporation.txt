# Otello Corporation



**Otello Corporation ASA** (formerly **Opera Software ASA**) is a Norwegian internet company which develops advertising and mobile software for operators, publishers and advertisers. It operates through its subsidiaries which include AdColony (formerly *Opera Mediaworks*), a mobile advertising platform and network, Bemobi, a subscription-based mobile application and game discovery service, and Skyfire Labs, which provides mobile operators cloud based access for network management and video optimization, and advertising facilitation.

Opera Software ASA was founded as a holding company for Opera products and businesses. It changed its name to Otello Corporation after it sold off its web browser and consumer business along with the *Opera* brand (Opera Software AS) to a Chinese consortium of investors. While initially it planned to wholly sell itself off to the consortium the deal did not go through due to regulatory approvals, it settled by selling its consumer-facing web browser business instead.
