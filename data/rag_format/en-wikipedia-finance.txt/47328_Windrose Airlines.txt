# Windrose Airlines



**Windrose Airlines**, legally **Wind Rose Aviation Company**, is a Ukrainian charter airline based at Boryspil International Airport. Founded on 28 October 2003, the airline's headquarters is in Kyiv; it operates charter flights to destinations in Europe, Turkey, and Egypt.


## History

The airline was established in 2003 to provide charter flights to destinations in Europe and the Middle East. It is most probably part of the Privat Group of billionaire Ihor Kolomoyskyi which also owned PrivatBank before it was nationalised, Ukraine International Airlines, as well as formerly owned now-defunct airlines Cimber Sterling, Donbassaero, Dniproavia and AeroSvit.

In 2006, regular flights to Moscow and Kaliningrad in Russia were initiated. In 2008, the company expanded its route network, then sharply reduced it. Since 2008, Windrose Airlines has focused on charter flights. From 2010 to the present day, the airline has been licensed to operate regular flights, should the need arise. The airline was the first to carry out flights basing its aircraft at various airports in Ukraine.

In December 2019, the company rebranded. In June 2020, the company started domestic flights in Ukraine.

As a result of the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the company suspended all flights, stating "due to the imposition of martial law in the country, Windrose will suspend flights indefinitely, but we will be in touch."

As of March 2024, Windrose Airlines operates charter flights under contract with Fly One Airlines out of destinations such as Tbilisi, Yerevan and Chisinau.
