## Involvement in Pickleball

In 2017 CBS's 60 Minutes aired a segment on Sheriff Tom Dart who runs Chicago's Cook Country Jail. While watching the program, Roger observed many of the inmates were simply playing cards or watching TV and decided to introduce pickleball in the prisons.

He contacted Sheriff Dart and offered his services which were accepted. The introduction of the game at the jail proved to be a huge success. Disciplinary problems were reduced and gang members who previously wouldn't talk to each other played pickleball together. His introduction of the game in Chicago was featured in a front-page story in USA Today. The success of his program in Chicago led Roger to various prisons in various states.

Pickleball is currently the fastest-growing sport in the country. Others now are replicating Roger's efforts by teaching the game at prisons in their communities. In 2023 he co-founded PICLeague.org, a non-profit that supports instructors who are replicating his efforts and teaching the game in prisons.
