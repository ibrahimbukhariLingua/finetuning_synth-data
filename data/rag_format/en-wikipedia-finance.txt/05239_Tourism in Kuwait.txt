Following the Gulf War, Kuwait embarked on a journey of infrastructural development. This led to the reconstruction of numerous tourist attractions, including the Al Qurain Martyrs Museum, established to honor the Kuwaiti soldiers who were martyred in the Gulf War. The invasion of Kuwait marked a turning point for the country, transforming it into a developed state and paving the way for the growth of its tourism industry.
