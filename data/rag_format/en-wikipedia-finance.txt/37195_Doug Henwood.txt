# Doug Henwood



**Doug Henwood** (born December 7, 1952) is an American writer. Until 2013, he published a newsletter, *Left Business Observer*, that analyzed economics and politics from a left-wing perspective. He is a contributing editor at *The Nation*.


## Early life and education

Henwood was born to Harold and Victorine Henwood in Teaneck, New Jersey, and grew up in Westwood, New Jersey. As a youth, he was acquainted with Marxism, but he briefly self-identified with conservatism toward the end of high school. According to Henwood: "Sometime late in high school, I fell under the spell of Milton Friedman and Bill Buckley, and about the first thing I did when I got to college was join the Party of the Right (POR). I got tired of all the pompous rituals, and political sanity returned, bringing me back to the left from which I'd started."

Henwood received a B.A. in English from Yale University in 1975. After college, he worked as secretary to the chair of a small Wall Street brokerage firm headed by a former Bell Labs physicist who used quantitative analysis techniques in the mid-1970s, predating the later widespread adoption of similar methods on Wall Street.

From 1976 to 1979, Henwood pursued a doctorate in English at the University of Virginia, but left before completing his dissertation. He then worked for two years as a copywriter and assistant to a medical publisher in New York.


## Career


### Writing

In September 1986, Henwood launched *Left Business Observer* (LBO) (ISSN 1042-0134).

In 1992, Henwood worked with John Liscio on *The Liscio Report on the Economy.* In 2000, after Liscio's death, Henwood and Phillipa Dunne, a business partner, inherited *The Liscio Report* and continue to publish it.

Henwood has written four books. His first, *The State of the USA Atlas* (1994), is a social atlas of the U.S. in the Pluto Press atlas series. This was followed in 1997 by *Wall Street* (Verso Books), in which Henwood describes the workings of high finance, and then by *After the New Economy* (The New Press, 2003), an analysis of the 1990s boom and bust. Henwood's most recent book is *My Turn: Hillary Clinton Targets the Presidency* (Seven Stories Press, 2016).

His articles have appeared in *The Nation*, *Harper's Magazine*, *Grand Street*, *The Village Voice*, *Newsday*, the *Los Angeles Times*, *The Guardian*, and *Extra!*. He is a contributing editor at *The Nation*.

Lapham, George McGovern, Joseph Stiglitz, Gore Vidal, Yanis Varoufakis, and Slavoj Žižek.
