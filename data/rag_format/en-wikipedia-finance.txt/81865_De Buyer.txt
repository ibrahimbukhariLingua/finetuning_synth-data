## History

A metallurgy manufactory was founded in 1830 at the locality of Faymont in the Val-d'Ajol commune, situated in the Vosges department in Lorraine, France. Initially, the company produced sheet metal and hand-crafted wrought iron utensils using iron ore extracted from the surrounding mountains. It gradually industrialized between 1850 and 1950 under the leadership of the de Buyer family, which acquired the production site in 1867.

In 1957, Herv√© de Buyer joined the company as a demonstrator and later took over its management in 1988. Facing competition from mass retailing and emerging countries, he decided to reposition production towards the high-end market.
