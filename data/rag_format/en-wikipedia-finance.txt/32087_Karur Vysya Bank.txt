## History

**The Karur Vysya Bank Limited**, popularly known as **KVB**, was set up on 25 July 1916 by M. A. Venkatarama Chettiar and Athi Krishna Chettiar to capitalise on the previously unexploited market of traders and agriculturists in and around Karur, a town in Tamil Nadu. The bank later expanded out of Karur in search of additional business opportunities and established a presence across India.

The bank celebrated its centenary on 10 September 2016 at Chennai with the then-President of India Shri. Pranab Mukherjee as the guest of honor.
