## Early life until the First World War

Sigmund Wassermann was the youngest son of Emil Wassermann. He attended the Humanist Gymnasium in Bamberg. He went on to study at the Handelshochschule Berlin and obtained his doctorate from the University of Erlangen on October 22, 1912, with a thesis entitled "Das Sortengeschäft in Deutschland in seiner geschichtlichen Entwicklung" ("The Historical Development of the Variety Business in Germany").

In 1915 Wassermann was drafted as a soldier into the 24th Bavarian Infantry Regiment in Bamberg and was promoted to lieutenant during the war. On September 19, 1917, he was awarded the "Ehrenzeichen P.E.K.. II. class". His discharge took place on December 18, 1918 from the 5th Bavarian Infantry Regiment as a result of demobilization.

As later honors he received for his participation in the war on August 18, 1927 the possession certificate of the "Prinz-Alfons-Erinnerungszeichen" donated by His Royal Highness, Prince Alfons of Bavaria, as well as on April 23, 1935 the Cross of Honor for Front Combatants based on the decree of July 13, 1934 from the Reich President Field Marshal General von Hindenburg in memory of the World War 1914/18..

From 1932 to 1933, he was a member of the board of the Centralverband des Deutschen Bank- und Bankiersgewerbes. Together with Max Warburg, Willy Dreyfus and Eugen Mittwoch, he sat on the board of trustees of the Haffkine Foundation, which had taken over the supervisory duties of the "Central Committee." He left this function only after his own emigration.


## Escape from Nazi Germany and occupied Netherlands

After the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Wassermann was persecuted due to his Jewish heritage. On January 21, 1939, Wassermann escaped to Holland, where he worked for a short time as a banker at N.V. Fidia Financieering en Discontering Maatschappij und Bankierskantoor Albert Graef N.V.*.* He fled with a passport issued by the Berlin police chief together with a residence permit until September 19, 1941. His place of refuge was Honthorstraat 52 in Amsterdam.

In April 1941 he had to sell the painting by Anna Rosina de Gasc *An Allegory of Hearing* (also known as Woman playing a lute) to the art dealer P. de Boer through his lawyer C. F. van Veen for the price of 1,000 guilders. The painting was restituted to the heirs of Sigmund Wassermann in 2008 following a decision by the Dutch Restitution Commission.
