Appenzeller cheese


# Appenzeller cheese



**Appenzeller cheese** (German pronunciation: [ˈapn̩ˌt͡sɛlɐ] ) is a hard cow's-milk cheese produced in the Appenzellerland region of northeast Switzerland, in the two modern-day cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden. It is classified as a Swiss-type or Alpine cheese.


## History

Cheese from Appenzellerland has a documented history of at least 700 years, being first mentioned in a document from 1282. However, the manufacturing process is not mentioned and may have been different from currently.

About 75 dairies produce Appenzeller, each with a different recipe for their brine wash. Most of the recipes are trade secrets.


## Production

An herbal brine, sometimes incorporating wine or cider, is applied to the wheels of cheese while they cure, which flavors and preserves the cheese while promoting the formation of a rind.


## Variants

The cheese is straw-colored, with tiny holes and a golden rind. It has a strong smell and a nutty or fruity flavour, which can range from mild to tangy, depending on how long it is aged. Three types are sold:

* "Classic". Aged three to four months, mildly spicy. The wheels are wrapped in a silver label.
* "Surchoix". Aged four to six months, strongly spicy. Gold label.
* "Extra". Aged six months or longer, extra spicy. Black label.
