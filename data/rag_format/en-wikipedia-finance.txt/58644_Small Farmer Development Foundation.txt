## History

Small Farmer Development Foundation traces its origins to the Small Farmers and Landless Work Development Project, an experimental project of Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development. The project ran from 1975 to 1976 in Bogra District, Comilla District, and Mymensingh District. In July 1988 the project was expanded to Patuakhali District and Barguna District. The first part of the project completed in 1991.

The second phase continued from 1991 to 1996 and included Barisal District and Bhola District. The third phase of the project ran from 1998 to 2004. Later on the project was transformed into a separate legal foundation under the Article 28 of the Companies Act of 1994 to continue its work.
