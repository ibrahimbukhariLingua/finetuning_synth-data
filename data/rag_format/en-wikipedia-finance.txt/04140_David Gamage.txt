Gamage subsequently helped design legislation for a number of other proposed federal wealth tax and Billionaire and Ultra-millionaire income tax reforms, including President Joe Biden's proposed Billionaire Minimum Income Tax reform proposal. Along with economist Emmanuel Saez and tax law professors Brian Galle and Darien Shanske, Gamage has also designed legislation for a wealth tax reform proposal for the state of California, and for multi-millionaire mark-to-market income tax reform proposals for the states of Illinois, New York, and Vermont.
