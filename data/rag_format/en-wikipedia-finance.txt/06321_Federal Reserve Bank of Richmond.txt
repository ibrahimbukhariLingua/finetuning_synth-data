## History and Building

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has had three locations in Downtown Richmond, Virginia. When it opened in 1914, it was located near the federal courts. From 1919 to 1921, a new building for the Federal Reserve was constructed at 100 North Ninth Street. The Fed offices existed here from 1921 until 1978, when they moved to their current location. The old 1921 Fed building is now used as the Supreme Court of Virginia, which moved to the location in 1978 from its former building at 1111 East Broad Street.

The current building, in the Central Office District, has an aluminum facade and was designed by Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the former World Trade Center. Despite being one of the tallest buildings in the state, 49% of the building's total floor area is located underground. The building was proposed in 1972, and built from 1975 to 1978.
