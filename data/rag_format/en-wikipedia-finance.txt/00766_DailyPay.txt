# DailyPay



**DailyPay** is an American technology company founded in 2015, which provides payroll services such as earned wage access. DailyPay charges up to $3.49 for users to receive 100% of their earned but unpaid income.


## History

DailyPay was founded in 2015. The company allows other organizations and payroll providers to offer early access wages to employees. The service is often used by companies with low-wage employees, who work paycheck-to-paycheck.

Employees who use the service are charged no fee to arrange a wage or partial wage withdrawal a day or two or three ahead of time.
Or, they can be charged a small fee (currently $2.99 as of 2024) to instantly withdraw their wages. Not all wages are available this way (some are held back until payday), but Daily Pay also offers a pre-paid Visa debit card which has no fees and offers all wages, holding nothing back from potential withdrawals but participants must sign up to have their direct deposits sent to Daily Pay. The service also allows users to check their balances and track earned wages through their employers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In September 2016, the company raised $5 million in financing during its Series A Round. In February 2018, the company raised $9 million in Series B funding.

In 2018, human resources company ADP announced that it would be offering early wage access to its clients through DailyPay.

As of 2020, the company had roughly 500,000 active users, and had partnered with companies such as Burger King, Uber, DoorDash and Shiftgig.

In 2021, the company received an honorable mention on Fast Company's "World Changing Ideas Awards".
