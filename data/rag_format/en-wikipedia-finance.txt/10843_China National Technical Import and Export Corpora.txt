## Corporate history

CNTIC was established in 1952 in the first five-year plan to build state industrial capacity. It officially spent the next four decades under the direct control of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (now the Ministry of Commerce). In 1998, it became a subsidiary of the state-owned national champion, China General Technology Group, as one of the founding members of the Global 500 ranked company. In 2022, CNTIC was reorganized into subsidiary Genertec International Holding Co., Ltd. According to some sources, the company was rechartered in 1983, the year the MSS was established.

In 2008, CNTIC contracted with Indonesian state-owned power company Perusahaan Listrik Negara to construct a thermal power station with a capacity of 660 megawatts in Cilacap.

In 2010, Jiang Xinsheng, former president of CNTIC, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for accepting bribes and leaking state secrets to French company Ariva (later Framatome) while administering a government bid for new nuclear reactors at several Chinese power plants. Ariva was competing against American conglomerate Westinghouse for the construction of additional reactors at the Sanmen Nuclear Power Station in Zhejiang, and Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station in Guangdong. Despite Westinghouse winning the bid, during negotiations, Ariva was unexpectedly given the contract for construction of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong.
