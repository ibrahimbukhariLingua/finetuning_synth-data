As the city reverts to normal, Adachi stays behind to let Kaito and the others escape the Underbank before it collapses in on itself. While Kaito and Nagare rekindle their friendship, another boy watches over them. | | | |

| Following the Money Ghost incident, Kaito, whose debt is waived by Sennen, uses his ten billion yen prize to help out his friends, using what's left over for a bath of Yummy Sticks. Three months later, the Gappori Company has grown in popularity, with people regularly challenging Kaito and Nagare to tag battles. Mitsuo in particular is pleased with how much money the company is earning, even making plans for a movie adaptation, though the others don't necessarily share his enthusiasm. Just then, a pig-like "money fairy" named Boochokkin emerges from Kaito's BankFon, demanding a lot of money to eat in exchange for an appearance in their movie. Meanwhile, a mysterious totem pole appears and spreads virtual space across the town, sending hero suits to turn everything in the candy store into money. Sick of everyone arguing over the movie instead of protecting the candy store, Kaito gives all of Gappori Company's money to Boochokkin, who gives Kaito and Nagare new Bank Registers, allowing them to transform into their hero suits. The enemy hero suits start using black money to recover their battle money, but thanks to the appearance of a sudden electric ball, Kaito and Nagare manage to beat their opponents, banishing the totem and returning the candy store to normal. After Boochokkin is dismayed to find that since he ate all of Gappori Company's funds, the movie can't be made, the boy who saved them, Sekito Sakurada, transfers into Kaito's class. | | | |

| Kaito becomes bewildered by the actions of Sekito, while Nagare notices he possesses his own Bank Register. The next day, as Kaito and the others accompany Ai to a supermarket opening, the market is suddenly attacked by another 'Tower of Seizure', bringing forth more Rampage Suits, Tick-A-Tack and Snap Shutter. As Kaito and Nagare struggle against their ability to stop time, they manage to use their abilities against each other and defeat them. Afterwards, Nagare confronts Sekito about who he is at school, but is seemingly crushed when he protects Kaito from a falling Tower of Seizure. | | | |

| After being helped by Sekito upon being knocked out by the barrier Tower of Seizure, Kaito learns from Hikari that Nagare was most likely converted into data and absorbed into the tower rather than crushed. Meanwhile, in the market district, a strange man named Ryuuga Tennouji attempts to buy out the fishmongers and cause dispute among their business partners. Isshin attempts to fight against him, but Ryuuga quickly defeats him before using another Tower of Seizure on the fish market to seize all of its property. Upon learning of the situation, Kaito confronts Ryuuga and his hero suit, Like the White Tiger, which proves to be too powerful for even Enter the Hero, forcing Sekito to rescue him. As Kaito laments not being able to beat Ryuuga, a man calling himself the cabinet prime minister suddenly emerges from his toilet. | | | |
