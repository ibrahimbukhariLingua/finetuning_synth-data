## History

Findel started as a greeting card company and went public in the early 1960s under the name "Fine Art Developments." It spun off its greeting card business in 1997 as a separate company called "Creative Publishing", which was subsequently acquired by Hallmark Cards in 1998. The company changed its name to "Findel plc" in 2000 and then to **Studio Retail Group plc** in 2019.

It was previously listed on the London Stock Exchange between the early 1960's to 2022 before the company fell into administration and shares were suspended on 14 February 2022 when it announced its intention to appoint administrators.

In August 2010, Findel sold CWIO, Confetti.co.uk and I Want One of Those (IWOOT) to The Hut Group.

In April 2013, Findel sold its healthcare division, NRS, to LDC, and in March 2015 Findel sold its Kleeneze business to CVSL Inc.

In February 2016, Findel sold its online sports retailing business, Kitbag, to the leading US provider of licensed sports apparel and merchandise, Fanatics, Inc., a snub to Mike Ashley & Sports Direct who had expressed interest in the brand. Sports Direct acquired an 18.9% share in Findel but was unsuccessful in appointing a director.

In April 2017, Findel appointed Phil Maudsley as group CEO.

In June 2019, Findel announced plans to rename itself as Studio Retail Group, and this change came into effect in July.

In April 2021 Studio sold the Findel Education businesses for £30 million.

In February 2022, Studio announced its intention to appoint administrators because options to secure additional borrowing had failed, leaving it insolvent. Its shares are currently suspended on the London Stock Exchange.
