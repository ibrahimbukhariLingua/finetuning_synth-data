Charter International


# Charter International



**Charter International plc** was a large British engineering business based in London. It was acquired by Colfax Corporation in January 2012.


## History

Charter International's origins can be traced back to the British South Africa Company, which was founded in 1889 by Royal Charter. During 1965, on the initiative of Anglo American Corporation, the company merged with *The Central Mining & Investment Corporation* and *The Consolidated Mines Selection Company*; the combined company was called *Charter Consolidated*. Slightly over one-third of the shares of the newly-created company were owned by Anglo American Corporation. At the time of its formation, the firm's assets were mainly mining investments and its strategy was to develop as a mining finance house actively engaged in mineral exploration and the development of mines throughout the world.

Throughout the 1980s, Charter Consolidated gradually disposed of its overseas mining concerns, opting to instead concentrate on its British engineering interests. It also acquired 80% of Morrison Construction, although the Morrison family repurchased the shares in 1989.

During 1993, the company's name changed to *Charter plc*.

In 1994, it acquired ESAB; three years later, the company also acquired *Howden*.

During early 1999, the company announced that it was seeking to spin out its subsidiary Pandrol Rail Fastenings. Four years later, Pandrol was acquired by DelachauxÂ [fr] of France.

In 2008, the business was restructured with the creation of a new Irish resident holding company, *Charter International plc*.

During January 2012, the company was acquired by the American technology business Colfax Corporation.


## Operations

The company had two main businesses:

* ESAB: welding, cutting and automation
* Howden: air and gas handling
