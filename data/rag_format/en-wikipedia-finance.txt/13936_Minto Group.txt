Some of Minto's joint-venture partners have been with Lasalle Investment Management, Greystar, and CPPIB.


## History

Minto Group was founded in 1955 by Gilbert, Irving, Lorry and Louis Greenberg, as a home builder. It was originally called **Mercury Homes**, but renamed itself Minto Construction Company in 1957. Its first large development was Parkwood Hills in Nepean in partnership with Westmore Investments. As part of that development, Minto built Canada's first high-rise condominium, Horizon House on Meadowlands Drive. The firm developed a number of other subdivisions in the Ottawa area in the 1960s and 1970s; in 1971, three quarters of construction in Nepean was by Minto.

In the early 1980s, the firm expanded to Florida.

In 1991, Roger Greenberg, son of Gilbert, became CEO, after the death of his uncle Irving.

In 2013, Michael Waters, who is not part of the Greenberg family, became CEO.

In May 2018, Minto announced it would hold an IPO for its Canadian multi-residential properties. The properties became part of a new entity, Minto Apartment Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), which Minto Group continues to have a significant ownership stake in. The trust would initially own 4279 rental suites, 72% of which would be in Ottawa, with the intention of eventually holding all of Minto's 13,000 multi-residential units. Minto Group held the IPO in part to provide money to Minto's owners, the Greenberg family. Minto raised $200 million in the IPO, which took place on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The IPO took place on June 29, 2018, with an initial price of $14.50 per share, and under the share symbol MI.UN.
