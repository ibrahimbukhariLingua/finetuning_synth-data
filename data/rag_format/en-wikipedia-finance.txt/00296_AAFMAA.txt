AAFMAA was founded in 1879 by a group of Army officers in response to the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn to provide financial assistance to the families of deceased soldiers.

## History

AAFMAA was established on January 13, 1879, in response to the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn to provide financial assistance to the families of deceased soldiers. The founding documents of the association were prepared by a committee of Army officers chaired by Brigadier General Roger Jones.

The association was originally called the Army Mutual Aid Association and membership was only open to members of the Army. In 1984, membership expanded to include Air Force officers and the name was changed to Army and Air Force Mutual Aid Association (AAFMAA) in 1987. In 1995, membership expanded to include non-commissioned Officers and, in 2000, membership expanded again to include enlisted ranks.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In September 2011, membership expanded to include service members of the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard. As of 2020, membership includes all members of the United States Armed Forces who are on active duty, retired, guard, reserves, students of the service academies, ROTC cadets, and honorably discharged veterans. To reflect the expansion in membership, the association's name was changed to American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association on June 12, 2013.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
