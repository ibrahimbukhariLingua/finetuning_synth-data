BT Business and Public Sector


# BT Business and Public Sector



**BT Business and Public Sector** was a division of United Kingdom telecommunications company BT Group that provided fixed-line, mobile, broadband and IT services to businesses (predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises) and the public sector in the UK and Ireland. It bought many of its services from BT's other divisions: EE, BT Global Services, BT Wholesale and Openreach. It also sold other vendors' products and services such as the Avaya IP Office business telephone system.

In April 2018, Gavin Patterson, then BT Group's CEO, announced Wholesale and Ventures was to be combined with the group's Business and Public Sector division into a newly-formed division, BT Enterprise. It came after BT's decision to undertake a streamlining of its operations, in a bid to strengthen its offerings as a business.

Prior to its merger with Wholesale and Ventures, Business and Public Sector was formerly known as **BT Business** that was established alongside BT Consumer following a two-way split from former division, **BT Retail** in 2013 to allow BT to "better serve its customers and focus even more on delivering its strategic priorities". It took on the business operations of BT Retail that involved the merging of BT Business, BT Enterprises and BT Ireland while BT Wi-fi (part of BT Enterprises) and the consumer part of BT Ireland transferred to BT Consumer. It took on its current name following BT's new organisational structure that took effect in April 2016 after its acquisition of EE, and comprises the existing BT Business division along with EE's business division and those parts of BT Global Services that are UK focused.
