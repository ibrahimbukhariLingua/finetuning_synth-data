## History

Prodege was founded in Torrance, California, in 2005 by entrepreneur Josef Gorowitz. The company originally partnered with search providers to build a platform for raising charitable donations. Supporters of the charities would earn money for the charities while surfing and shopping using white labeled web browsers. The company started offering the custom browsers to brands as a way to earn money from their fans' online activities. Early customers included the Green Bay Packers football team, and singer Kanye West.

In February 2008, Prodege launched the online rewards portal Swagbucks.com – under co-founders Josef Gorowitz and Scott Dudelson – and introduced Swag Bucks (SB) as a digital currency earned for activity throughout its network of websites. By shopping and playing online games, customers would earn SB, points which could be redeemed for gift cards and other merchandise.

In January 2013, Prodege founder Josef Gorowitz appointed former Shopzilla and Fandango CEO Chuck Davis as the company's executive chairman.

Chuck Davis was also mentioned as being a TCV Venture partner.

In July 2014, Prodege announced its acquisition of SodaHead.com, an online polling technology platform founded by Jason Feffer. SodaHead.com CEO Chris Dominguez and Founder Jason Feffer joined Prodege's executive leadership team in the move.

In May 2019, the company bought Cotterweb Enterprises, a Minnesota-based operator of reward sites in the US, Canada, and the UK. In July, Prodege partnered with online local service deal company Groupon to develop a local merchant reward card program for customers.

In February 2020, Prodege bought digital coupon company CouponCause. In May, Prodege bought Upromise, a loyalty program focused on saving for college, from student loan company Sallie Mae. Prodege partnered with Isometric Solutions and Panel Consulting to provide polling for the Prediction Survey, a political forecast developed by Thomas Miller during the 2020 Georgia Senate election.
