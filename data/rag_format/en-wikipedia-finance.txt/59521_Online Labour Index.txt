Online Labour Index


# Online Labour Index



The **Online Labour Index** (**OLI**) is an economic indicator measuring the activity of the global online gig-economy. It was created and is administered by the researchers Otto KÃ¤ssi, Vili Lehdonvirta, and Fabian Stephany, at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford.

The OLI monitors the demand and supply of work from the world's leading online gig-work internet platforms. The index has become an international reference for the measurement of the online freelance economy.


## Online Labour Observatory

Since 2021, the OLI is hosted on the **Online Labour Observatory**, a joint project of the International Labour Organisation and the Oxford Internet Institute.
