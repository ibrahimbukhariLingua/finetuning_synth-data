Finance and Expenditure Committee


# Finance and Expenditure Committee



The **Finance and Expenditure Committee** (known as the **Public Accounts Committee** until 1962, and as the **Public Expenditure Committee**, from 1962) is a select committee of the House of Representatives, the unicameral chamber of the New Zealand Parliament, responsible for matters relating to the audit of the financial statements of the Government and departments, Government finance, revenue, and taxation. The committee is currently established by Standing Order 189.


## History

Following a reform of the former Public Accounts Committee in 1962, the Public Expenditure Committee was established and became the most influential parliamentary committee in New Zealand, establishing "a strong reputation for itself, principally because it enjoyed powers of investigation not granted to other committees and because it attracted able and ambitious members. It was the only committee able to set up its own inquiries (without reference from the House), had subcommittees chaired by opposition members, and enjoyed the support of staff from the Legislative department (now the Office of the Clerk) as well as the Audit Office."


## Jurisdiction

This committee looks at business related to economic and fiscal policy, taxation, revenue, banking and finance, superannuation, insurance, Government expenditure and financial performance, and public audit.


### Ministers answerable

The wide scope of the committee's oversight means a number of government ministers are answerable to the committee. The table below lists them, and their position:

| Minister | Portfolio |
| --- | --- |
| Hon. Nicola Willis | Minister of Finance |
| Hon. Simon Watts | Minister of Revenue |
| Hon. Louise Upston | Minister of Social Development and Employment |
