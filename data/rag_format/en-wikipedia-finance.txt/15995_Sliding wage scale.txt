Sliding wage scale


# Sliding wage scale



The **sliding wage scale** consists in increasing the wages as the prices rise in order to maintain the purchasing power of the workers even if there is inflation.

It was removed in 1982 as Jacques Delors (PS) was Finance minister, in the second administration of Pierre Mauroy (PS).


### In Italy

In Italy it was introduced in 1945, modified several times since and definitely removed in 1992.
