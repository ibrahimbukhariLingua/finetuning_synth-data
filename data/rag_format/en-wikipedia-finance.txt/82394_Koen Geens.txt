## Career


### Early career

Since 1986 Geens has become a professor at the KU Leuven. In that capacity, he was appointed by the Belgian government as the scientific coordinator for the codification of the Belgian laws on companies and financial accounts, which culminated in a new Belgian company code in 2001. In 2009 Geens was a candidate for rector of the KU Leuven but lost out to Mark Waer.

Geens is a co-founder of an independent lawfirm in Belgium with offices in Antwerp, Brussels and Kortrijk.


### Political career

From 2007 to 2009 Geens served as chief of staff to the Flemish minister-president Kris Peeters. When Steven Vanackere resigned in March 2013 as Minister of Finance, Geens was appointed as his successor.

In October 2014 Geens became Minister of Justice in the Michel Government. In addition, he chaired the European People's Party’s Justice Ministers Meeting.

During his time in office, Geens steered through the legislative process a 2015 law which invalidated passports and identity cards of people authorities believe plan to go and fight for militant Islamist organizations in the Middle East. In the wake of the 2016 Brussels bombings, both Geens and fellow cabinet member Jan Jambon offered their resignation to Prime Minister Michel over lapses; both were refused.

As part of the government formation, Geens was appointed by King Philippe of Belgium to explore possibilities to form a coalition government in early 2020.
