It was not until 1948 when it moved to Frankfurt that the publishing company was renamed "Deutscher Fachverlag". The first specialist periodical was released in the founding year: TextilWirtschaft. Since then, dfv has continuously expanded its range of publications and enlarged it by means of numerous start-ups, purchases and shareholdings.
