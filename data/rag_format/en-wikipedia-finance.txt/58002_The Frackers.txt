***The Frackers: The Outrageous Inside Story of the New Billionaire Wildcatters*** is the second non-fiction book by the American journalist Gregory Zuckerman.

The book was a national bestseller and was named among the best books of 2014 by *The Financial Times* and *Forbes Magazine* and as book of the year by the New York Financial Writers Association. Greg discussed the book on C-Span in 2014, after its release.


## Reception

Steve Banker of *Forbes* commented "This is a book that could have been deadly dull. But the writer, Gregory Zuckerman, an experienced business journalist, did a good job of mixing the technological developments, politics, and economics of this business with a mostly entertaining narrative of the entrepreneurs who built this business and made billions in the process."
