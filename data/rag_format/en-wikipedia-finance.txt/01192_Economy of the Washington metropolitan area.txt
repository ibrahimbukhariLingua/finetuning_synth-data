The economy of the Washington metropolitan area includes the economy of Washington, D.C., and its suburbs, including parts of Maryland, all of Northern Virginia, and Jefferson County, West Virginia. In 2022, the DC metro area had the country's fifth-highest gross metropolitan product, at $541 billion. The region's economy is highly diverse and includes the principal industries of the US federal government, tourism, information technology, research, hospitality, news media, and bioscience.

Key commercial hubs in the Greater Washington area include Downtown, Washington, D.C., Tysons, Virginia, Rosslyn, Virginia, Crystal City, Virginia, Bethesda, Maryland, and Silver Spring, Maryland.

## Federal government

As the national capital of the United States, the country's federal government is headquartered in the city, and is therefore a major employer and important economic engine for the broader region. As of July 2022, 25% of people employed in Washington, D.C., were federal government employees. Important federal government agencies and departments are also located in suburban Washington. The Pentagon, which houses the US Department of Defense, is headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia, and the CIA is headquartered in the Langley area of Fairfax County, Virginia. The FBI is planning on moving its headquarters from Downtown Washington to Prince George's County, Maryland.

In addition to people employed directly by the federal government, the region also has many people employed in organizations whose work relies directly on funding from or contracting with the federal government, or in some other way interacts directly with the government. Many lobbying organizations seek to influence US government policy. Similarly, the region has a high concentration of law firms headquartered in the area or with major offices in the region that work with the federal government as well as with other institutions and industries. Historically, K Street was where many of the city's lobbying organizations were located, and is therefore sometimes used as a metonym for lobbying of the US federal government. Among the key lobbying and law firms include Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, and Holland & Knight.

In addition to important law firms and lobbying organizations, many other organizations rely on the federal government for employment as a result of receiving funding directly from the government or using their work with the government to encourage private donors to support their mission. These include defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations, many of which have their headquarters in the Washington area so they can be close to the federal government.

As of February 2022, the largest U.S. government agencies located in the Washington Metropolitan Area are: the United States Department of Defense headquartered in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the United States Postal Service, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Department of Justice.
