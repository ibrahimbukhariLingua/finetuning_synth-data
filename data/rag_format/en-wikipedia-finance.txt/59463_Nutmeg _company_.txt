# Nutmeg (company)



**Nutmeg** is an online investment management company based in London. The company was founded in April 2011 and is registered in the United Kingdom as **Nutmeg Saving and Investment Limited**.

Nutmeg is an online discretionary investment management company (discretionary meaning that it makes all investment decisions on behalf of its customers, rather than providing a platform for people to trade on). The company invests customers’ funds in line with their investment goals and appetite for risk. It invests in listed securities, debt, cash, commodities and other investment asset classes, primarily, but not exclusively, via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). It provides an online alternative to stockbroker platforms where customers make their own trading decisions.

Nutmeg provides investors with online access to investment management taking their inspiration from the tech world rather than the financial sector.


## History

Nutmeg was founded in 2011 by Nick Hungerford (1980–2023) and William Todd.

Martin Stead left the company in 2019, following a loss of £18.6 million. Nutmeg has yet to make a profit.

Nutmeg managed portfolios worth £1.9 billion as of December 2019.

The company was purchased by JP Morgan for £700m in June 2021.
