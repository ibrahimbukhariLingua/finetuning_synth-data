Wingtech's main business includes semiconductor chip design, wafer manufacturing, optical imaging and communication product integration. The company is partially owned by several state-owned enterprises under the direction of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC).

In 2019, Wingtech acquired Nexperia. The Nexperia semiconductor subsidiary, originally Royal Philips semiconductor, manufactures wafers. In 2021, Wingtech acquired Ofilm Group, a former iPhone camera module supplier. In 2023, Wingtech agreed to sell the Inmos microprocessor factory following a UK government divestment order on national security concerns.

During the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, Wingtech was reported by *The Wall Street Journal* to gain an additional foothold in Apple's supply chain following protests at a Foxconn factory in the Zhengzhou Airport Economy Zone.

In December 2024, Wingtech was targeted in a new round of US export controls and added to the United States Department of Commerce's Entity List.
