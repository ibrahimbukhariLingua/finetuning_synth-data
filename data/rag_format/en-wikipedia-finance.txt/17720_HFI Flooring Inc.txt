## Court action

HFI Hardwood Flooring Inc. v.the Deputy Minister of National Revenue Appeal No. AP-94-188 Archived 2015-04-02 at the Wayback Machine

HFI successfully appealed under section 67 of the Customs Act from three decisions of the Deputy Minister of National Revenue made under subsection 63(3) of the Customs Act on Monday, July 17, 1995.

This successful appeal changed the way duties were charged on wood flooring products, thereby reducing the cost of wood flooring, making it more affordable for the consumer. This was an important factor in wood flooring's significant increase in popularity and market share with the North American consumer over the last generation.


## Initial public offering

HFI made a successful initial public offering (IPO) on 21 May 1998. Price to the public per common share was $0.30 and the total offering of public common shares was CN$300,000.

## Financial statements

## Companies’ Creditor Agreement Act

On January 30, 2001, HFI was placed under a Company Creditor's Arrangement Act protective order, [CCAA], pending the submission of a reorganization plan to its creditors. A Court Order ("the Order") was granted by the Ontario Supreme Court, on January 30, 2001 under the CCAA, giving protection to HFI in order to continue the re-structuring of the Company. On February 1, 2001, the company said "HFI has made a pro-active move and filed for court protection under the Companies’ Creditor Agreement Act ("CCAA"). This legislation allows HFI to carry on their regular business during the reorganization period. Uncooperative creditors of HFI during this period are prevented from disrupting our regular business. This is not a bankruptcy or a receivership, but allows HFI time to focus on getting back to our business of selling product."

The assets of HFI were then sold to Domcor on March 26, 2001.
