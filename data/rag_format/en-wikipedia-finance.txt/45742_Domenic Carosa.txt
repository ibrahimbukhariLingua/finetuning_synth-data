In 2004, Destra Corporation announced a large deal with Yahoo! to integrate a new suite of services with OzHosting.com's Web hosting service.

Destra reverse-listed on the exchange just prior to the dot-com crash in 2000. Carosa diversified the company into a web hosting company following the crash, and later led it to become a $100 million company and the second largest web hosting company in Australia.

Carosa's company was greatly affected by the collapse of Opes Prime in 2008. After the collapse, Carosa had his stake reduced in the company to less than 1%, at which point he shifted from Managing Director to the role of a consultant for the company.

During the same year, the company also raised an additional $2 million in a round of funding and also acquired Any Questions Answered (AQA Mobile) for $165,000.

Crowd Mobile again featured in the media in early 2016, after it reached monthly revenues of $4.1 million. The questions and answers website at that stage had reached over 1,000 experts answering questions in over 30 different languages.

Following the operational restructuring in 2019, Crowd Mobile Saw a notable turnover, led by CEO Domenic Carosa and chairman Steven Schapera. Schapera is the co-founder of BECCA Cosmetics, a company acquired by cosmetics organisation Estee Lauder in a buyout worth a reported AU$300 million. Additionally, along with the restructure at the start of the year the organisation changed its name from Crowd Mobile to Crowd Media Holdings Limited.
