> *Success in football, like banking business, is more a product of efficient coordination within the team, optimum utilization of the resources and determination to stay ahead of others through a mix of well-thought strategy and timely use of opportunities. Therefore, as members of the premiere financial institution of the UT, we need to keep focus whether we are on the field or off it.*
