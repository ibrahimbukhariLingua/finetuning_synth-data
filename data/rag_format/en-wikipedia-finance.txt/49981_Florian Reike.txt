# Florian Reike



**Florian Reike** is a German entrepreneur who works with cryptocurrency. He is one of the co-founders of nakamo.to and head of research at the Advanced Blockchain AG.


## Life

Reike grew up in Detmold, Nordrhein-Westfalen. He studied economics at the Martin-Luther-Universit채t Halle-Wittenberg between 2015 and 2017, but dropped out without finishing his degree. Today he lives and works in Berlin and New York.


## Career

Reike started to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2013 when he was a student, donating blood and working in a fast food restaurant to earn money he could invest. At a meeting of the blockchain and cryptocurrency scene in Berlin he met Robert A. K체fner and moved into his shared apartment. With the other flatmate Till Wendler they founded nakamo.to in 2017, a company with the aim to further develop Distributed Ledger Technology, which blockchain is based on. According to Reike, traditional blockchain technology has some shortcomings such as scalability, which led the founders of nakamo.to to focus on their new project *peaq* that is based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG). DAGs are a DLT System that for example the cryptocurrency IOTA is based on. Reike invested in IOTA as a student and when Robert K체fner first approached him in Berlin, Reike introduced him to IOTA. Since 2017, nakamoto.to is part of the Advanced Blockchain AG.
