## Legal cases

Landmark Media Investments, as occupiers of a building in Cork, were sued by Kilquane in April 2013.

On 16 May 2013, Landmark Media Investments were given a High Court order to vacate their premises. The floors occupied were vacated. The building was put up for sale, by the owners, in September 2016.

## 2017/2018 sale to *The Irish Times*

In February 2017, it was reported that Landmark Media Investments had appointed KPMG as advisors. A range of options were being considered, including an Independent News and Media "link" with the *Irish Examiner*.

In March 2017, it was reported that *The Irish Times* might bid for the *Irish Examiner*, and by April both *The Irish Times* and Independent News & Media had signed non-disclosure agreements and entered a sales process for the *Irish Examiner*. On 17 April 2017, though Independent News & Media stated that they were not in talks to acquire the *Irish Examiner*, the *Irish Independent* reported that "*The Irish Times* was "understood to be engaged with the team hired to find a buyer for the paper".

During May 2017, it was reported that both Key Capital and *The Irish Times* were considering a bid to acquire the *Irish Examiner*. It was also reported that Iconic Newspapers might acquire the Landmark Media Investments regional titles and that PWC and AIB were in discussions about a debt restructure.

By July 2017, it had been reported that Iconic Newspapers, Trinity Mirror and Independent News & Media were all interested in acquiring the remaining regional newspapers.

In August 2017, it was reported that Landmark Media Investments had ceased making payments into the Irish Examiner Pension Scheme. The scheme was to be wound up. At the same it was reported that *The Irish Times* would be the likely purchaser of *Irish Examiner* and a deal was likely to be announced in Q4 2017.

By late August 2017, it was reported that *The Irish Times* were in "pole position" to acquire the *Irish Examiner*, and that Iconic Newspapers were likely to acquire the Landmark Media Investments regional titles. It was also reported that Rupert Murdoch's Wireless Group was interested in acquiring Landmark Media Investments radio assets.

On 17 September 2017, it was reported that *The Irish Times* purchase of the *Irish Examiner* had been agreed in principle but costs, staffing and debt apportionment were still be agreed. It was suggested that the sale of the *Irish Examiner* to *The Irish Times* would occur first, with Iconic Newspapers then acquiring regional titles. Some staff were reportedly concerned about job losses.

On 17 October 2017, Landmark Media Investments confirmed that the sale of the Group was under negotiation. By 6 December 2017, Landmark Media Investments had confirmed that all newspaper, radio and website interests would to be sold to *The Irish Times* subject to regulatory approvals. AIB was to take a "debt write down" as part of the sale.

During March and April 2018, The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) announced their decision to carry out a Phase 2 investigation into the proposed transaction, whereby *The Irish Times* would acquire sole control of the *Irish Examiner*. The CCPC then cleared *The Irish Times* deal to buy Landmark Media Investments, and (following this determination) the parties had to submit a separate notification to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Denis Naughten, approved the proposed transaction in June 2018. The BAI also approved the radio station purchases. Legal and compliance steps are required next before the deal can close.

On 10 July 2018 the acquisition was complete. *The Irish Times* owned the media investments from this date. The Crosbie family no longer owned the media assets.
