# Onevest



**Onevest**, a New York–based investment crowdfunding site for startups that was acquired by Business Rockstars in April 2018 (also known as: **Rock The Post**), allowed entrepreneurs to raise capital from accredited investors. In July 2014, startups launching on Onevest had collectively raised over $66 million.

Additionally, Onevest provided a service for co-founder matchmaking via its sister site CoFoundersLab.com, where entrepreneurs were able to find their co-founder prior to launching their startup. CofoundersLab was one of the largest matchmaking services for entrepreneurs with over 80,000 entrepreneurs registered. One of the most success stories was Revolv, which was acquired by Google.

Currently, the Canadian embedded wealth management company "OneVest" goes by this name.


## History

Rock The Post was founded by Alejandro Cremades and Tanya Prive. Their goal was to help entrepreneurs, including those without strong business connections, raise funds and gain exposure. The site was launched in November 2011. Initially the platform offered projects that could receive funding or in-kind contributions (e.g., time and/or materials), but switched to equity and debt-based funding only.

Rock The Post received $857,000 in seed money from a group of angel investors in February 2012.

On April 23, 2013, Rock The Post announced the addition of Barbara Corcoran to its board of directors. Barbara is one of the "Sharks" starring in the ABC TV show *Shark Tank,* where she has personally invested in over 20 startups. Corcoran is a contributor to the NBC's *Today Show*, and hosted "The Millionaire Broker with Barbara Corcoran" on CNBC.

It focuses on "entrepreneurs, not dreamers", in trying to keep its platform legitimate and help eliminate some of the barriers that typically stand between startups and growth capital.
