## Controversies

Kind is a vehement opponent of the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga, which was installed as a restriction on the influence and voting rights of investors. Many clubs outsourced their professional teams to corporations. With the regulation, commercial corporations (e.g. Hannover 96 GmbH & Co. KGaA) do not have decision-making power.
