Refinitiv


# Refinitiv



**LSEG Data & Analytics**, formerly **Refinitiv**, is an American-British global provider of financial market data and infrastructure.

The company was founded in 2018 as a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters, which then sold a 55% stake to Blackstone Group LP in August 2018. In October 2019, Blackstone and Thomson Reuters announced the sale of the company to London Stock Exchange Group. LSEG completed the US$27 billion purchase from the two previous owners in late January 2021, and Refinitiv is now a subsidiary of LSEG.

The company has an annual turnover of $6 billion, with more than 40,000 client companies in 190 countries.


## History

Refinitiv's predecessors include Thomson Financial.

Thomson Reuters sold a 55% majority stake in its Financial & Risk (F&R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP on October 1, 2018, in a deal which valued the total F&R business at about $20 billion. This business was formed into Refinitiv.

Under the deal, Thomson Reuters transferred its complete financial and risk product portfolio to Refinitiv, with the exception of Regulatory Intelligence, Risk Compliance Learning and Data Privacy Advisory Services. Company CEO David Craig presided over the transfer from Thomson Reuters, which he joined as Group Strategy Director in 2007. British-born Craig's previous role was a partner at US-based global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

In August 2019, London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) agreed to buy Refinitiv in an all-share transaction valuing the company at $27 billion. LSEG expected to receive regulatory approval to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2021. It was finally awarded such approval by EU regulators in January 2021.

In 2019, Refinitiv spun off Tradeweb in an IPO, while maintaining a controlling interest.

In March 2020, Refintiv announced the purchase of software-as-services firm Scivantage for an undisclosed amount.

Refinitiv acquired Advisor software in July 2020 and Red Flag Group in October 2020.

On May 18, 2022, LSEG announced its acquisition of MayStreet, a low latency execution software and market data provider.

At the end of August 2023, the Refinitiv brand was retired in favour of LSEG brand.


### Censorship in China

Under pressure from the government of China, Refinitiv censored over 200 stories by Reuters covering the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, removing them from its Eikon platform for consumers in mainland China. The company developed a "Strategic China filter" to block politically sensitive stories from readers in mainland China.


## Operations

Refinitiv runs more than 130 fintech data, analytics, trading, and risk assessment tools including World-Check, a risk intelligence database for financial crime legislation compliance, FXall, Eikon, the execution management system REDI, Datastream for macro-economic analysis, Quantitative Analytics on the Cloud, AutoAudit and the Elektron Data Platform, creating 32,000 risk intelligence records every month from internal and third-party sources. Another, the World-Check Risk Intelligence database, compiles information from international financial watch lists, government records, and media searches to tackle money laundering. Refinitiv also maintains a database featuring more than a million mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals spanning over 40 years, covering corporate finance transactions and investment banking league tables across equity markets, debt, loans, bonds, project finance, initial public offerings (IPOs), joint ventures, repurchases, private equity and municipal bonds.

Although Thomson Reuters used to be a minority shareholder in Refinitiv, it supplies Reuters news and content to the company's 400,000 plus customers in more than 40,000 businesses around the world, supported by a network of at least 13,000 registered developers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
