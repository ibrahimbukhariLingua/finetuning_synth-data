## History

Longhorn Publishers Plc operations commenced in Kenya in May 1965 as **Longmans of Kenya** a wholly owned subsidiary of Longman Group International of the United Kingdom. Its main business was selling and promotion of Longman publications published in the UK. In December 1969, the company changed the name to **Longman Kenya Limited**. It was only until the 1970s when the company began printing locally. A government decision in the early 1990s led to the ban of importation of textbooks. This initiative led to reduced margins thus led to Longman gradually reducing its shareholding in the business due to unattractive returns. In 1993, Longman UK fully divested from the company when it sold its remaining 40% shareholding to Kenyan investors including Centum Investment Company. As a result of this divestiture, the company changed its name to **Longhorn Kenya Limited**.
