## Overview

The firm was established in 1996 as Shinhan Investment Trust Management. In 2002 it became a joint venture between South Korea's largest group, Shinhan Financial Group and the French bank, BNP Paribas. The resulting company was named 'Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management' where Shinhan Financial Group and BNP Paribas held 65% and 35% of the company respectively. In January 2021, Shinhan Financial Group acquired the 35% stake of BNP Paribas in the joint venture making it a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result, the "BNP Paribas" part was dropped from its name.
