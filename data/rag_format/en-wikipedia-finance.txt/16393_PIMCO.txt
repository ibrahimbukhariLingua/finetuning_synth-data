## History

PIMCO initially functioned as a unit of Pacific Life Insurance Co., managing separate accounts for that insurer's clients. The firm was founded in 1971, launching with $12 million of assets. In 2000, PIMCO was acquired by Allianz SE, a large global financial services company based in Munich, Germany, but the firm continues to operate as an autonomous subsidiary of Allianz.

On September 26, 2014, it was announced that Bill Gross, co-founder and former chief investment officer (dubbed the "Bond King" in the investment arena), was stepping down to join Janus Capital Group. In April 2015, PIMCO announced the hire of former Federal Reserve Chairman Dr. Ben Bernanke as a senior advisor, following in the footsteps of predecessor Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.


## Leadership

PIMCO appointed Emmanuel Roman as CEO effective November 1, 2016. He succeeded Douglas M. Hodge, who was CEO from 2014 to 2016. According to PIMCO, the members of their global advisory board members are:

* Ben Bernanke, former Federal Reserve Chair and Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.
* Joshua Bolten, President and CEO of the Business Roundtable and former White House Chief of Staff.
