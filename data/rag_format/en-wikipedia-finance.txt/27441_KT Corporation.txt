# KT Corporation



**KT Corporation** (Hangul: 주식회사 케이티), formerly **Korea Telecom**, is a South Korean telecommunications company, mobile network operator (MNO) and mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). KT is the third-largest wireless carrier in South Korea, with 13.5 million subscribers as of Q4 2023.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The formerly fully-state-owned firm (the government's National Pension Service currently owns 12.19% shares and is the largest shareholder) is South Korea's first telecommunications company and is a major supplier of the local landline and broadband internet market, serving about 90 percent of the country's fixed-line subscribers and 45 percent of high-speed Internet users. After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in January 1997.

The company's merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, in 2009 made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won in assets as of 2009.

In January 2011, KT launched unified brand "Olleh" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services.


## Company overview

Founded in 1981 as a public utility, KT played a major role in Korea's development in the information technology hub sector. KT sold its wireless affiliate in 1994, founding another in 1996 and becoming, along with LG Dacom, one of Korea's earliest ISPs. In 2001 KT acquired struggling broadband provider Thrunet, then the largest broadband company in Korea, which paved the way for KT to dominate the broadband market. In 2009, KT merged with its wireless subsidiary KTF, paving the way to the integration of landline and cellular services. Ever since KT introduced the Apple iPhone to South Korea, it has been constantly seeking new business areas, such as media, e-commerce, and global business partnerships. The company has a well-distributed shareholder structure under which the National Pension Service (NPS) is the largest shareholder (6.81% as of December 31, 2012), but NPS holds no managerial rights over the company. Under the current shareholder structure, no controlling shareholder exists.

| KT Sports |
| --- |
| | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Baseball | Basketball | Esports | | | | | | Shooting | Field Hockey | Sports | |

KT Corporation sponsors an e-sport team and a number of sports teams and athletes, some of which were inherited from KTF before the merger. The corporate headquarters of KT Sports is located in Suwon, where its baseball and basketball teams are located.

* Suwon KT Sonicboom (men's basketball) – based in Suwon
* KT Wiz (baseball) – based in Suwon
* KT Rolster (StarCraft II and League of Legends Professional Gaming Teams) – based in Seoul
* KT Shooting Team (sports shooting) – based in Hwaseong
* KT Hockey Team (men's field hockey) – based in Seongnam

In addition to the teams, KT is the main sponsor of the South Korea national football team and several LPGA of Korea Tour golfers.

One of KT Corporation's major corporate rivals is SK Telecom. Match-ups between teams owned by both companies are dubbed the "Telecommunications Derby" by the media. The rivalry is contested in esports and men's basketball. When SK owned a baseball team, the term was also applied to match-ups between SK Wyverns and KT Wiz. Due to KT Wiz being a relatively new franchise and having a poor record for much of its early years, the "rivalry" was largely one-sided and given less attention compared to esports and basketball, where such match-ups are generally hotly contested affairs.


## Smart grid investment

KT is currently involved in the Jeju Smart Place test bed project led by Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, which is being pursued for the purpose of testing and developing smart grid business models. The project is being conducted on 6,000 households in Jeju island's Gujwa-eup area, and is scheduled to be conducted over a period of 42 months from May 2009 to May 2013. The aim of the project is to provide an integrated energy management service and achieve the means for efficient energy usage by adopting renewable energy sources and energy storage devices. The project is being executed by the KT Consortium, which is composed of KT and fourteen other companies, including Samsung SDI, Hyosung, Samsung Electronics, and four contractors, with the focus being to conduct demonstration tests on electric power-communication convergence business models.


## Controversy


### KT Internet slowdown incident

On April 19, 2021, KT explained that "the customer's information was incorrectly transferred due to an error in the process of moving the studio recently" and "For this reason, only 100 megabit would have been provided." Subsequently, KT officially acknowledged and apologized for causing inconvenience to customers at the 6 o'clock meeting.


### Malware incident

In June 2024, following a JTBC investigation, it was revealed that KT remotely installed malware on the computers of 600,000 subscribers in order to throttle, disrupt and monitor their usage of the torrent protocol, a popular peer-to-peer file transfer protocol. A police investigation on the matter is ongoing.
