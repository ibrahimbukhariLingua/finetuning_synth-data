Insurance (constituency)


# Insurance (constituency)



The **Insurance functional constituency** (Chinese: 保險界功能界別) is a functional constituency in the elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong first created in 1998. Being of the functional constituencies with fewest electorates, the constituency is restricted to only 126 insurers as of 2021. It corresponds to the Insurance Subsector in the Election Committee.

A similar Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services functional constituency was created for the 1995 election by Governor Chris Patten with a much larger electorate base of total 171,534 eligible voters.
