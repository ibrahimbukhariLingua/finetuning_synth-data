The company also had a large interest in the Earl's Court area but sold its interest (co-owned with Transport for London) to Delancey and a Dutch pension fund in November 2019. It acquired REIT status in December 2019.

In June 2020, Capital & Counties Properties agreed to purchase property tycoon Samuel Tak Lee's stake in its rival Shaftesbury. The company acquired a 26.3% stake of Shaftesbury for a reported £436 million.

On 2 March 2023, the company announced the implementation of a proposed merger with British real estate investment trust Shaftesbury PLC. The merger proposals saw Capital & Counties Properties changing its name to Shaftesbury Capital.
