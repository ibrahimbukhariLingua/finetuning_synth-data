## History


### Founding and growth (2015–2018)

Airwallex was created in 2015 in Melbourne, Australia by five co-founders. At the time, software engineer Jack Zhang and architect Max Li had invested in a coffee shop in Melbourne, and were finding cross-border payments for imports to be costly and time-consuming for a small company. Zhang was involved in designing the digital forex trading platforms for the National Australia Bank (NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ), and was inspired to provide a simple, cheaper service to small and midsize businesses. Zhang and Li partnered with Lucy Liu and Xijing Dai, fellow alumni from the University of Melbourne, as well as Ki-Lok Wong. With the founders investing a combined $1 million, roles included Zhang as CEO, Liu as president, Li as head of design, Dai as chief technology officer, and Wong as principal architect.

The Airwallex platform was developed to lower consumer costs on foreign exchange rates, and was launched in a closed beta trial stage in 2015. The company built a proprietary network with banks, such as Standard Chartered, DBS Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, to handle local transactions. ANZ began providing transactional services to Airwallex in 2017, with both MasterCard's Send platform and Tencent's WeRemit service powered by Airwallex. In 2018, Airwallex moved its headquarters from Melbourne to Hong Kong and turned down a US$1 billion acquisition bid by Stripe. Airwallex closed the "second-largest fundraising round in Australian start-up history" in July 2018, netting $80 million.


### International expansion (2019–2020)

After a round of funding in March 2019 brought in $100 million from investors such as DST Global, Sequoia Capital, and Hillhouse Capital, Airwallex reached a valuation of US$1 billion, and became the "quickest company in Australia to reach unicorn status," as well as Australia's third technology unicorn overall. Press reported in February 2020 that instead of focusing largely on forex transfers, Airwallex was aiming to become a "neobank" akin to Salesforce, specifically the "AWS of financial services." In 2020, NAB was providing payroll and rental payment services to Airwallex. The NAB had previously cancelled transactional banking services for Airwallex customers in 2018. In 2021, Hong Kong unfroze $18.2 million in funds and released them to Airwallex after Hong Kong's High Court dismissed suspicions by the Hong Kong Police Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance that two former Airwallex clients had used Airwallex for money laundering.
