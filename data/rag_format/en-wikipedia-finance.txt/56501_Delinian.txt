# Delinian



**Delinian** (formerly **Euromoney Institutional Investor**) is a British financial media company that has interests in business and financial publishing and event organisation.

As of 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, it was one of Europe's largest business and financial information companies. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index until it was acquired by private equity groups, Astorg and Epiris, in November 2022.


## History

Euromoney magazine was founded by Sir Patrick Sergeant in 1969 as an international business-to-business media group focused primarily on the international finance sector. The costs to launch the magazine were covered with £6,000 from Associated Newspapers and £200 from Sergeant himself and a number of other Mail employees, with Hambros Bank putting up stand-by credit. Padraic Fallon joined the magazine as editor. He would takeover as chairman and executive after Sergeant, overseeing the company until his death in 2012.

Patrick Sergeant continued to manage the business until 1985 when he became chairman. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1986. Sergeant retired as chairman in September 1992 when he was appointed president and non-executive director, but served as a board member until May 2018.

It was formerly 49% owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust Group until the stake was spun-off in 2019.

In July 2022, the company agreed to accept a takeover offer worth £1.7 billion from private equity groups, Astorg and Epiris. The transaction was approved by the court on 22 November 2022. The company changed its name to Delinian in January 2023.
