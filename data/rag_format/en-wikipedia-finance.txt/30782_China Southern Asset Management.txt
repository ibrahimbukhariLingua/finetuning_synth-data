**China Southern Asset Management** (Chinese: 南方基金管理股份有限公司; pinyin: *Nánfāng jījīn guǎnlǐ gǔfèn yǒuxiàn gōngsī*) is a Chinese asset management company founded in 1998. It is considered one of the largest asset management companies in China.


## History

The company was established on 6 March 1998, as one of the first local asset management companies in China that was approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

In 2008, the company set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with Oriental Patron. The joint venture was named **CSOP Asset Management** with China Southern Asset Management paying HK$140 million for a 70% stake and Oriental Patron paying HK$60 million for the remaining 30%. CSOP Asset management currently has several ETFs on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In December 2022, it launched the first Bitcoin and Ethereum futures ETFs in Hong Kong.

In July 2024, China Southern Asset Management launched an ETF that focused on Saudi Arabian stocks that was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. It was popular amongst Chinese investors where it hit the first-day price limit and raised 634 million yuan (US$87 million). It offered Chinese investors convenient access to markets in Saudi Arabia in areas such as energy and oil which were previously difficult to access due to overseas regulations.


## Regulatory issues

In 2008, Wang Limin who was previously a manager at China Southern Asset Management was banned for seven years from participating in China's capital markets and fined 500,000 RMB after making a profit of 1.5 million RMB via Rat Trading. This involved buying shares in companies his funds invested in and then selling them for a profit.
