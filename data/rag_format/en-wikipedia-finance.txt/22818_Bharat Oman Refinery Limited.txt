Following these delays and cost overruns, the Omani company initially dropped out of the project but subsequently decided to be a minority stake holder in the project holding 26% equity. The refinery which was to have been commissioned in 2009 was finally inaugurated in May 2011 by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. One percent of the plant's equity is held by the Government of Madhya Pradesh.
