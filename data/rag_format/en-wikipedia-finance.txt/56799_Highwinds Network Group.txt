## Financing announcements

On March 11, 2008, Highwinds announced it had closed a $55 million round of equity financing led by General Catalyst Partners and Alta Communications. The funds will be used to expand the Highwinds CDN and RollingThunder network.

On May 4, 2011, Highwinds announced that it had secured a $50 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank and Comerica Bank.

On August 8, 2013, Highwinds announced that it had secured $205 million in new financing. The transaction was led by Cerberus Business Finance, LLC and Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., an investment fund managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P., with participation from the company's existing equity sponsor, General Catalyst Partners, and the company's management team. The funding positioned Highwinds for massive growth of its global CDN.
