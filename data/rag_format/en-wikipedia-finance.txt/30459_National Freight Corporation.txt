# National Freight Corporation



The **National Freight Corporation** was a major British transport business between 1948 and 2000. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and at one time, as NFC plc, was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.


## History

The company was established in 1948 as **British Road Services** (BRS). It was the road transport company formed by the nationalisation of Britain's road haulage industry, under the British Transport Commission, as a result of the Transport Act 1947.

From 1963, the company was administered by the Transport Holding Company and had four main operating areas: British Road Services, BRS Parcels, Pickfords and Containerway & Roadferry.

On 1 January 1969, it was renamed the National Freight Corporation. On the same date a 51% share in Freightliner was transferred from the British Railways Board (BRB). This was transferred back to the BRB on 1 August 1978.

In 1980, the assets of the National Freight Corporation were transferred to the National Freight Company. In 1982, the company was sold to its employees as the **National Freight Consortium** in one of the first privatisations of state-owned industry. The new company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1989 and subsequently became **NFC plc**.

BRS Parcels was rebranded as **Roadline** and was sold in a management buy-out as Lynx Express in 1997. NFC disposed of Pickfords in 1999 to Allied Van Lines.

In 2000, NFC plc merged with Ocean Group plc to form Exel plc.
