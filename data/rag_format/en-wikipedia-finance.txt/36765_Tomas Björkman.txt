In 2017, in partnership with the Norrsken foundation, Björkman launched the digital platform 29k.org. The platform aims to help you reconnect with yourself, like-minded people and what you value most in life.

## Writings

Björkman has published three books:

* In The Market Myth (2016), he analyzes the market as a social construction and reveals a number of common misconceptions about market strengths and weaknesses.
* The Nordic Secret (2017, editor), written by Lene Rachel Andersen, explores how the Nordic countries invented a new kind of education, developed everybody’s potential and changed their fate. Large-scale investment in personal development and education is outlined as a decisive cause of success.
* In The World We Create, (2019), Björkman draws a systemic overall picture of social development, integrating external naturalistic and internal phenomenological perspectives with postmodern social criticism into an early narrative of metamodernism.
