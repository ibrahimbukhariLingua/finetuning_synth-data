## History

As noted in the 2008 June/July issue of CPA Technology Advisor Magazine: "AME offers a good payroll module and core financial functions that are sufficient for smaller entities, especially for businesses with limited technical expertise. It is attractively priced and covers the basic needs of a small company."
