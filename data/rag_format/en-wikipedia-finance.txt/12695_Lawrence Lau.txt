In 2015, Lau suggested that students who stormed the University of Hong Kong council meeting should be imprisoned.


## 2019–20 Hong Kong protests

In 2019, Lau criticised Hong Kong protests. He wrote: "To find a way forward, one must recognise that the current disturbances reflect deep-rooted, but until now largely latent, anger and discontent among lower-income groups in Hong Kong, especially younger people. The discontent and perceived lack of hope provided the environment for domestic and foreign agitators to succeed."


## Other activities

In January 2009, Lau was named a non-official member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong by Chief Executive Donald Tsang. He renounced his United States citizenship to take up the position. Later that year, he became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation.
