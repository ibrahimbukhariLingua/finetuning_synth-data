## History

The bank was founded in Nairobi, in 1986, as **Finance International Limited**, a "Non-Banking Financial Institution" (NBFI). The name of the institution was later changed to the **Finance Institution of Africa** (FINA). In 1991 the company changed ownership. In 1995, the Central Bank of Kenya, the country's banking regulator, changed the banking laws, requiring all NBFI's to convert to commercial banks or close shop. To comply with the law, FINA converted to a commercial bank, **Fina Bank (Kenya) Limited**, in February 1996.

Between 2005 and 2008, Fina Bank Kenya established subsidiaries in Rwanda and Uganda, forming the Fina Bank Group.

In 2013 Guaranty Trust Bank of Nigeria, acquired 70% shareholding in Fina Bank Group for a cash consideration of US$100 million. In January 2014, Fina Bank Kenya and her subsidiaries rebranded to reflect the change in ownership. In February 2014, Fina Bank Group rebranded to Guaranty Trust Bank (East Africa).
