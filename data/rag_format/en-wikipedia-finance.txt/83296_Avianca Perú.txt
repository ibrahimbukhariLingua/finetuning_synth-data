Avianca Perú


# Avianca Perú



**Avianca Perú S.A.** (formerly **TACA Perú**) was an airline based in Lima, Peru. It operated domestic services and international services. Its main base was Jorge Chávez International Airport, Lima. The airline operated out of 18 airports. It was part of the Synergy Group and operated its flights with TACA Airlines' codes. Through Synergy Group, it was one of the seven nationally branded airlines (Avianca Ecuador, Avianca Costa Rica, etc.) in the Avianca Holdings group of Latin American airlines. The airline ceased all operations on May 10, 2020.


## History

The airline was established in 1999 by Daniel Ratti and Ernesto Mahle as *TransAm* and started operations in July 1999. It was then rebranded into TACA Perú when Grupo TACA established a holding in the airline.

In 2004, a crisis arose in the aviation industry in Peru, caused by the cessation of operations of Aero Continente, the main operator of internal flights. During this period, TACA Perú made some flights to the city of Arequipa's Rodríguez Ballón International Airport.

In 2007, TACA Perú began a period of expansion and relaunch, increasing the frequencies of its flights to the main cities of Central and South America, offering a wide range of connecting flights from Lima to North America in the mornings and evenings.

In 2012, new national destinations were included and the airline acquired its first and only Airbus A330-200 for medium-range international flights. a change of name was then announced and the airline assumed a new commercial identity within the AviancaTaca Holding group, under the Avianca brand.

On May 28, 2013, the airline was renamed to *Avianca Perú* after the AviancaTaca merger. At the time, it was owned by Daniel Ratti (51%) and the Synergy Group (49%).

In 2015, flights to São Paulo and San Salvador were added, those were operated with its Airbus A330-200. Regarding domestic flights, Chiclayo and Tarapoto were suspended indefinitely, allocating the planes used to an increase in frequencies to Cuzco.

On May 10, 2020, Avianca Holdings announced the cancellation of operations in Peru following its filing for bankruptcy protection, starting a process of liquidation and closure of Avianca Perú, which ended the airline after 21 years of operation. This took place during a worldwide airline travel downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
