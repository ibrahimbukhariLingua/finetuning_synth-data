**Nj Ayuk** (born 11 February 1980) is a Cameroonian attorney, author, and businessman.

Ayuk is the founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) of the Centurion Law Group, a Pan-African law firm that operates in the energy, financial, and extractive sectors. He is also the executive chairman of the African Energy Chamber. He has previously been convicted of fraud.

He is the author of several books and articles on energy. His book, *A Just Transition: Making Energy Poverty History with an Energy Mix,* was listed in the *Wall Street Journal* bestseller list.


## Early life and education

Ayuk was born 1980 in Cameroon. In 2000, he moved to the USA and studied at the University of Maryland, College Park, graduating with a bachelors in government and politics. In 2004, he earned a Juris Doctor degree at William Mitchell College of Law in the United States. Additionally, he received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the New York Institute of Technology.


## Career

Ayuk started his career at Baker Botts and then moved to the United Nations Development Programme. He also worked at Vanco Energy.

In 2007, a few months after working as a lawyer in the United States, NJ Ayuk founded the Centurion Law Group. Based in South Africa, the firm became one of the largest energy-focused law firms on the continent, with nearly 160 lawyers across Africa. It is also the first African law firm to be listed on the German stock exchange. Also in 2007, Ayuk pleaded guilty to "illegally using a U.S. Congressman’s
stationery and signature stamp to obtain visas for Cameroonians.

In 2013, the government of Equatorial Guinea hired Ayuk to renegotiate the country’s one sided agreement with British multinational BG Group (later acquired by Shell), committing to purchase all of Equatorial Guinea’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 17 years. Ayuk was becoming a sought-after source of information on Africa’s oil and gas industry. Also in 2013, NJ Ayuk joined Global Shapers, a non-profit foundation created by the World Economic Forum to unite a community of young leaders.

In 2018, NJ Ayuk was chosen to lead the African Energy Chamber. The organization aims to support the development of the African energy sector and promote best practices.

In 2019, Centurion Law Group launched Centurion International AG. The Germany-based energy advisory and legal services company was formed to facilitate African energy expansion and serve as a gateway for investors to participate in Africa’s development.

In 2022, Centurion International AG became the first Africa-focused services firm to have its shares listed on a German Stock Exchange. In the same 2022, the South African High Court ruled that Ayuk issued defamatory remarks towards the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and journalist Delfin Mocache.

In 2023, the *Mail & Guardian* reported that bogus copyright complaints were made to remove unflattering material about Ayuk and a politician.

In 2024, Ayuk stepped down as head of Centurion Law Group to focus on his work at the African Energy Chamber (AEC).


## Energy stance

After working for the United Nations Development Programme in Darfur, Sudan, Ayuk concluded that the war was rooted in a struggle for natural resources and the wealth associated with them. He soon after shifted his career to focus on Africa's energy resources.

His second book *Billions at Play: The Future of African Energy and Doing Deals* has been described as a roadmap for how the continent could better diversify its oil and gas to improve people’s lives and grow African economies.

*A Just Transition: Making Energy Poverty History with an Energy Mix* discusses the solution of moving Africa toward renewable sources of energy at the same time allowing the people to benefit from the continent’s fossil fuels. Ayuk argues how Africans should be able to continue benefiting from their natural resources, even as much of the world pushes the continent to leave its fossil fuels in support of global net-zero emissions objectives. He states that the entire continent produces only 3.8% of the world’s emissions, and, even if the continent tripled its natural gas-powered electricity consumption, the additional carbon dioxide would be the equivalent of only 1% of global emissions. He has said: “A continent that emits a negligible amount of carbon dioxide is being disproportionately pegged as a threat to the planet by developed nations."


## Recognition

In 2015, he was listed in *Forbes'* Top 10 Most Influential Men in Africa. Ayuk was named as one of the 100 Most Reputable Africans in 2023 by Reputation Poll International.
