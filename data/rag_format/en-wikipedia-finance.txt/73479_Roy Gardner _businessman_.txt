## Football career


### Manchester United

Gardner became a director of Manchester United in December 1999. He was appointed as non-executive chairman of Manchester United plc in November 2001, taking over from Sir Roland Smith on 31 March 2002. In April 2005, he and the Manchester United board issued a statement recommending against the proposed buyout by Malcolm Glazer and his family, saying the "proposed capital structure […] still contains more leverage [debt] than the board would consider prudent"; however, they were forced to issue a contrary statement a month later, once the Glazers had acquired enough shares to constitute a majority stake in the club. Gardner resigned as chairman in June 2005, shortly after the Glazer takeover, as did his fellow non-executive directors Jim O'Neill and Ian Mutch. In 2010, Gardner reiterated his criticism of the method the Glazers used to purchase Manchester United, describing it as not "a sustainable model".


### Plymouth Argyle

In July 2009, Gardner and business partner Keith Todd secured ownership of 13 percent of Championship team Plymouth Argyle as part of a consortium of international and local businesses which took over the club. He stated that it was the consortium's ambition to see Argyle promoted to the English Premier League within five years and focused on the club's bid to host the World Cup finals in 2018. Gardner also stated that he wished to "develop a better understanding of the club's precise needs, plan to progressively increase the budget for new players, in particular as we grow the commercial income of the club".

During Gardner's chairmanship, the football club was issued with a number of winding up orders over unpaid taxes and debts. It entered a repayment strategy, involving the sale of players Reda Johnson and Craig Noone.
In March 2010, the club announced that Home Park was to be transferred to the holding company owned by Gardner, Todd and Yasuaki Kagami. Gardner stated that no money would go directly to the club and that the £7.5 million received would be used to pay off the club's debts. This included the money owed to directors.
Gardner, Todd and their co-investors spent more than £3m in an attempt to save the club. Gardner himself almost trebled his stake. Kagami said the directors were “fighting tooth and nail to make sure the club does not go into administration.”
Gardner resigned as chairman on 27 December 2010 and the club entered administration shortly afterwards. The club formally exited administration on 31 October 2011 but only after Plymouth City Council agreed to re-purchase the stadium and other land belonging to the club was sold to local entrepreneur James Brent. The club was close to being liquidated after 125 years of history whilst staff had been without pay for almost a year.


## Honours

He was knighted in the 2002 Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to the gas and electricity industries.
