## Tax Consequences

Net personal casualty gains are taxed as gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets. See .26 U.S.C. § 165(h)(2)(B)


## Determination

Net personal casualty gains are the excess of a taxpayer's personal casualty gains over personal casualty losses in a given taxable year.


## Examples

1. A taxpayer’s insured home is destroyed by an accidental fire. Prior to its destruction, the home was valued at its adjusted basis of $100,000 and insured at $130,000. After receiving insurance proceeds, the taxpayer will have a personal casualty gain of $130,000 and a personal casualty loss of $100,000 for a net personal casualty gain of $30,000.
2. A taxpayer owns a vacant lot covered with rocks. The lot has a fair market value of $30,000, but were the rocks not there, it would be worth $35,000. Late at night, a thief removes the rocks. The fair market value increases to $35,000. The taxpayer has a personal casualty gain of $5,000.
