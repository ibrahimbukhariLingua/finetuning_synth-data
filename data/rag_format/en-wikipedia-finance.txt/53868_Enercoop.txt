## History

Enercoop was created in 2005 and initially, as the French electricity market wasn't yet liberalized, Enercoop just had companies as customers. Later on, in 2007, as the market was liberalized, Enercoop started to grow and totalized more than 200 customers.

In 2011, after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Enercoop went from 3,000 customers in 2009 to 10,000 in late 2011.

In 2014, Enercoop had 20,000 customers.

As of 2021, Enercoop had 100,000 customers


## Objectives

Its aim is to create many regional cooperatives around France where the local members can be in charge of all parts of the energy process from production to consumption. In this way the group intends to make citizens responsible for the energy they consume. Actually, in 2014, it has 6 regional cooperatives.

Enercoop's articles of association impose that at least 57% of the profits must be reinvested in means of electricity production. The remaining profits can either be reinvested or can reward its investors.
