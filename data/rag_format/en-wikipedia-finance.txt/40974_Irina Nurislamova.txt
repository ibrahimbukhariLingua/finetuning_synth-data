## Bashneft Case

Bashneft Case is a corporate conflict between the state-owned company Rosneft and the privately owned Russian company Sistema PJSFC. It is one of the most controversial corporate legal cases in the history of modern Russia.

On 15 May 2017, the Arbitration Court of Bashkortostan registered a RUB 106.6bn claim filed by Rosneft and Bashneft against Sistema, a preliminary hearing of the case was scheduled for 6 June, Irina Nurislamova was appointed as a judge for the case.

On 27 June, the Arbitration Court of Bashkortostan held the first hearing of the claim on the merits, during which it dismissed Sistema's motion to bring Rosimushchestvo to the case as a third party and scheduled the next hearing for 12 July. The court also ordered Sistema to produce evidence of the absence of losses from the restructuring of Bashneft and evidence of a positive economic effect from the restructuring, which, as noted by Sistema's lawyers in their objection, runs counter to the Supreme Court's explanation and the existing judicial practice, according to which “the 'burden of proof' lies with the claimants”.

On 19 July, after lodging complaints with a number of authorities, Sistema moved for judge recusal in the Rosneft case.
