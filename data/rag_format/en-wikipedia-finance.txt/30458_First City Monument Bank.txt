## History

The entity from which the bank was founded, **City Securities Limited (CSL)**, was established in 1977 by the late Oloye Subomi Balogun, the Otunba Tunwashe of Ijebu, a Yoruba traditional aristocrat. First City Merchant Bank was established in 1982 with seed capital from CSL. It was incorporated as a private limited liability company on 20 April 1982 and granted a banking license on 11 August 1983. It was the first bank to be established in Nigeria without government or foreign support. In 2001, the name of the bank was changed from First City Merchant Bank to First City Monument Bank Limited following the bank's transformation to a universal bank. A new subsidiary, FCMB Capital Markets Limited, was formed to support its corporate finance activities. On 15 July 2004, FCMB changed its status from a private limited liability company to a public limited liability company and was listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) by introduction on 21 December 2004.

Credit Direct Limited, a non-bank subsidiary, was established in 2007.

As a result of the 2010, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) regulation, FCMB Group Plc was formed and became the financial holding company for FCMB’s direct subsidiaries.

In 2014, FCMB (UK) Limited, a branch of First City Monument Bank Limited, was authorized to operate in the United Kingdom. It is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.
