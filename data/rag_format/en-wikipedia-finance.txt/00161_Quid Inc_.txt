The company is based in San Francisco with offices in New York City and London.

In 2016, World Economic Forum presented Quid with their Technology Pioneers award and IDC (International Data Corporation) named Quid a Top Innovator for the 2016 U.S. Financial Compliance and Risk Analytics Market.

## Criticism

In 2010, *TechCrunch* asked: “Does Quid have the most pretentious website of any startup ever?” The jab followed a debate on Quora discussing the website's use of Latin, arcane typefaces, and an overly academic tone. The company has since updated its website.
