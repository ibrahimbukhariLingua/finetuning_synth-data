Virgin Mobile South Africa


# Virgin Mobile South Africa



**Virgin Mobile South Africa** (**VMSA**) was a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) which was launched in 2006 as a joint venture between Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Cell C. Based in Johannesburg, the bustling business-hub of South Africa, Virgin Mobile South Africa has established itself as a dynamic and growing brand with stores nationwide. In February 2011, Cell C sold its stake to Virgin Group and Calico Investments, after which Virgin Group assumed a controlling stake. In November 2020 the company went into voluntary business rescue. In September 2021 their customers were informed that services would be stopped by the end of November 2021, but by 17 September 2021 all services were stopped, leaving many customers stranded.
