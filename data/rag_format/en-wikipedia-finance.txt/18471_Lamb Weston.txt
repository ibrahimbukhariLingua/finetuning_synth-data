**Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.** is an American food processing company that is one of the world's largest producers and processors of frozen french fries, waffle fries, and other frozen potato products. It is headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, a suburb of Boise.


## History

The company was founded in 1950 by Gilbert Lamb in a former co-op plant in Weston, Oregon. In 1988, it was acquired by ConAgra Foods and moved corporate offices from Tigard, Oregon, to Kennewick, Washington. In November 2016, ConAgra spun off the company to its shareholders. In October 2019, Lamb Weston formed the joint venture, Lamb Weston Alimentos Modernos S.A., with Sociedad Comercial del Plata.

In September 2023, it was announced Lamb Weston had acquired the Campbellfield, Victoria-headquartered Australian food manufacturer, Crackerjack Foods. The company will join the Lamb Weston Oceania subsidiary.

On 15 November 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed against Lamb Weston along with multiple other companies alleging that they are colluding together to all hike prices of potato products in a coordinated way.
