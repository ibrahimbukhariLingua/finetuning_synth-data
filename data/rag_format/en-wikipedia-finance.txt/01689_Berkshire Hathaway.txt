Berkshire Hathaway


# Berkshire Hathaway



**Berkshire Hathaway Inc.** (/ˈbɜːrkʃər/) is an American multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Originally a textile manufacturer, the company transitioned into a conglomerate starting in 1965 under the management of chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger (from 1978 to 2023). Greg Abel now oversees most of the company's investments and has been named as the successor to Buffett. Buffett personally owns 38.4% of the Class A voting shares of Berkshire Hathaway, representing a 15.1% overall economic interest in the company.

The company is often compared to an investment fund; between 1965, when Buffett gained control of the company, and 2023, the company's shareholder returns amounted to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% compared to a 10.2% CAGR for the S&P 500. However, in the 10 years ending in 2023, Berkshire Hathaway produced a CAGR of 11.8% for shareholders, compared to a 12.0% CAGR for the S&P 500. From 1965 to 2023, the stock price had negative performance in only eleven years. In August 2024, Berkshire Hathaway became the eighth U.S. public company and the first non-technology company to be valued at over $1 trillion on the list of public corporations by market capitalization.

Berkshire Hathaway is ranked 5th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and 9th on the Fortune Global 500. Berkshire is one of the ten largest components of the S&P 500 and is on the list of largest employers in the United States. Its class A shares have the highest per-share price of any public company in the world, reaching $700,000 in August 2024, because the board of directors has historically been opposed to stock splits.


## History

Berkshire Hathaway originated as a textile manufacturer formed in 1955 from the merger of Hathaway Manufacturing Company and Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the 1950s, accompanied by large layoffs.

In 1962, Warren Buffett began buying Berkshire Hathaway stock for his investment fund, Buffett Partnership Ltd., at $7.50 per share, anticipating that as the company liquidated textile mills there would come a tender offer when he could sell the shares at a profit. A year later, Buffett's fund owned 7% of the company. In 1964, Buffett offered to sell his shares back to the company for $11.50 each. Seabury Stanton, the manager of Berkshire Hathaway, told Buffett orally that he had a deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11.375 per share. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett bought more of the stock at an even higher price to take control of the company and fire Stanton; Stanton and his son resigned in 1965. However, this left Buffett's fund with a major interest in a declining textile business.

Buffett has described purchasing the Berkshire Hathaway textile company as the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, denying him compounded investment returns of about $200 billion over the subsequent 45 years. He has estimated that had he invested the same money directly in insurance businesses instead of indirectly via Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), it would have paid off several hundredfold. In 1985, the company's last textile operations were shut down.

In 1963, Franklin Otis Booth Jr. invested $1 million in the company and in 1968, David Gottesman invested in the company. The investments made both individuals billionaires.


### Acquisitions

In March 1967, Berkshire acquired National Indemnity Company, based in Omaha, Nebraska, for $8.6 million in the first acquisition by the company under Buffett's control and the company's entrance into the insurance business. National Indemnity was founded in 1940 by Jack Dabney Ringwalt. In 2012, National Indemnity acquired workers' compensation insurer GUARD for $221 million.

Berkshire acquired See's Candies in 1972 for $25 million. It produces boxed chocolates and other confectionery products in two large kitchens in California.

It now prints only a morning edition.

### Major stock purchases and sales

Buffett began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989; however, by the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire interest in the company.

Buffett has had a long relationship with Jeff Bezos; he turned down an opportunity to invest in Amazon.com in 1994 as he was unable to predict the company's future growth and it was losing money. Berkshire Hathaway purchased shares in Amazon in 2019 currently worth $2 billion.

Berkshire made its first investment in Tesco in 2006, and in 2012 it raised this stake to over 5% of the company, investing a total of $2.3 billion. Buffett sold around 30% of this stake in 2013 when he "soured somewhat on the company's then-management", realizing a profit of $43 million. As Tesco's problems mounted through 2014, Berkshire sold all the remaining shares with Buffett saying to shareholders that the delay in selling shares was costly. Berkshire realized an after-tax loss of $444 million on the Tesco investment.

In early 2008, Berkshire increased its stake in ConocoPhillips to 85 million shares. Buffett later described this as "a major mistake" as the price of oil collapsed during the Great Recession. Berkshire sold most of its shares but held 472,000 shares until 2012. That year, ConocoPhillips completed the corporate spin-off of Phillips 66, of which Berkshire owned 27 million shares. Berkshire later sold $1.4 billion worth of shares to Phillips 66 in exchange for Phillips Specialty Products. Buffett frequently referred to Phillips 66 as one of the best businesses Berkshire invested in because of its consistent dividends and share repurchase programs. However, Berkshire sold its entire holdings in 2020.

In September 2008, at the peak of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred stock in Goldman Sachs to provide it with a source of funding when capital markets had become constrained. The preferred stock yielded an annual interest rate of 10%, earning Berkshire $500 million in interest income per year. Berkshire also received warrants to purchase 43.5 million shares with at $115 per share, which were exercisable at any time for a five-year term. Goldman had the right to re-purchase the preferred stock at a 10% premium, and in March 2011 exercised this right paying $5.5 billion to Berkshire. Profit on the preferred stock was estimated at $1.8 billion and exercising the warrants yielded a profit of more than $2 billion. Buffett defended Lloyd Blankfein's decisions as CEO of Goldman Sachs and his efforts to improve the reputation of the company during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

In September 2008, BHE invested about US$230 million for approximately a 10% share of BYD Auto. Some shares were sold in 2023 and 2024, with Buffett motivated by the China–United States trade war.

In October 2008, Berkshire invested $6.5 billion in Wrigley Company as part of a financing package to enable Mars Inc. to acquire the company. Berkshire sold its remaining bonds and preferred stock to Mars in 2016.

In early 2011, Berkshire first invested in IBM. The shares were entirely sold in 2018.

On August 26, 2011, Berkshire Hathaway purchased $5 billion of preferred shares in Bank of America. The shares yielded 6%, earning Berkshire $300 million in annual interest. Alongside the preferred stock investment, Berkshire obtained warrants allowing Berkshire to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per share, which were exercised. By 2017, this position had yielded a profit of about $12 billion excluding the annual interest earned from the preferred stock.

In 2013, Berkshire and 3G Capital acquired H. J. Heinz Company for $28 billion including debt. In 2015, Heinz merged with Kraft Foods to form Kraft Heinz. In 2019, Buffett said that he overpaid in the deal.

In 2013, Berkshire owned 1.74 million shares of Gannett; however, it sold its shares in the second quarter of 2013.

In the first quarter of 2016, Berkshire began investing in Apple Inc., with a purchase of 9.8 million shares (0.2% of Apple) worth $1 billion. By the end of June 2016, this stake had increased to 15.2 million shares (0.3% of Apple). By December 31, 2016, Berkshire had built up a stake of 57.4 million shares (1.1% of Apple) with an estimated average acquisition price of $110 per share (before the 2020 4:1 split). Aggressive stock purchases continued and by March 31, 2017, Berkshire had amassed a stake of 129 million shares (2.5% of Apple). By December 31, 2017, Berkshire owned 166 million shares (3.3% of Apple). Berkshire bought 75 million more shares in early 2018. As of December 31, 2022,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ Berkshire owned 5.8% of Apple. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by nearly 50%, selling $75.5 billion worth of stock in the second quarter of 2024, increasing its cash reserves to a record $276.9 billion. Buffett had said that Apple has developed an ecosystem and level of brand loyalty that provides it with an economic moat, and that consumers appear to have a degree of price insensitivity when it comes to the iPhone. While Buffett generally does not invest in tech stocks, he has said that Apple is a consumer products company and that he understands consumer products businesses.

In the third quarter of 2016, Berkshire surprised investors by making large equity investments in the major US airlines. Buffett had previously described airlines as a "deathtrap for investors". Buffett had made an investment in US Airways in 1989 which, although he sold for a profit, almost lost Berkshire a substantial sum of money. In 2017, Berkshire was the largest shareholder in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines and a top 3 shareholder in Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. Buffett himself has described this as a "call on the industry" rather than a choice in an individual company. American Airlines' CEO Doug Parker is said to have won over Ted Weschler in arguing that the airline industry had consolidated sufficiently and rationalized supply such that longer-term profitability could be achieved in an industry that has historically been loss-making in aggregate. In April 2020, Berkshire sold all shares in the airlines due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air transport.

In June 2017, Berkshire invested $377 million Store Capital, a Scottsdale-based real estate investment trust that owned more than 1,750 properties in 48 states; the company was sold to private equity firms in 2022.

In June 2017, Berkshire acquired a 38.4% stake in Home Capital Group for $400 million giving lifeline to the Toronto-based embattled mortgage lender. The shares were sold in 2018.

In 2019, by purchasing warrants and preferred stock, Berkshire provided $10 billion in financing to Occidental Petroleum as part of its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Berkshire began investing in common shares of Occidental beginning in 2022 and has increased its position since.

Between September 2019 and August 2020, Berkshire purchased more than 5% of the outstanding stock of each of the five largest Japanese sogo shosha (Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Marubeni) through its National Indemnity subsidiary. These stakes were worth a total of over $6 billion as of August 2020. By April 2023, Berkshire increased its stake in each of those companies to 7.4%. He continued to increase the stakes over time.

In the second quarter of 2020, Berkshire added a position of more than 20 million shares in Barrick Gold; the shares were sold in 2021. In the third quarter of 2020, the company agreed to buy Dominion Energy's natural gas transmission and storage operations.

In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire acquired a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount Global. However, at an annual meeting on May 4, 2024, Buffett stated that he had sold all of his shares in Paramount at a substantial loss, blaming himself for deciding to invest.

In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire acquired 121 million shares of HP Inc. valued at more than $4.2 billion; the shares were sold in 2023 and 2024.

In the third quarter of 2022, Berkshire purchased 60 million shares in TSMC valued at $4.1 billion; the shares were sold in late 2022 and 2023 in part due to geopolitical tensions.

## Corporate affairs


### Investment strategy

Insurance is a major area of operations and the retained premiums (float) serve as an important source of capital. Buffett has said that he prefers to invest in evergreen businesses that generate predictable long-term returns, that he doesn't invest in companies that he doesn't understand, and that he does not like to invest in companies that may undergo significant change. The company has generally avoided investing in high-tech firms, missing early opportunities to invest in Microsoft and Amazon.com despite having relationships with the founders of those companies. With some exceptions, the company also usually does not invest in real property due to precise pricing, lack of competitive advantage, complex management, and corporation tax disadvantages.


### Share classes and aversion to stock splits

Berkshire Hathaway has never undergone a stock split of its Class A shares because of management's desire to attract long-term investors as opposed to short-term speculation. However, in 1996, Berkshire Hathaway created Class B shares, with a per-share value of 1⁄30 of that of the original shares (now Class A) and 1⁄200 of the per-share voting rights, and after the January 2010 split, at 1⁄1,500 the price and 1⁄10,000 the voting rights of the Class-A shares. Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B, though not vice versa. Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares but did so to thwart the creation of unit investment trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes.

In January 2010, as part of the acquisition of BNSF Railway, Berkshire completed a 50-to-1 stock split of its class B shares. The increased market liquidity resulted in the company's inclusion in the S&P 500.


### IPO and share price

On March 16, 1980, Berkshire became a public company via an initial public offering, selling Class A shares for $290 each. Shares closed over $1,000 for the first time on August 26, 1983 and over $10,000 on October 16, 1992. Shares closed over $100,000 for the first time on October 23, 2006. They first closed over $200,000 on August 14, 2014. Shares closed over $500,000 for the first time on March 16, 2022.


### Executive compensation

The salary for Buffett is $100,000 per year with no stock options, which is among the lowest salaries for CEOs of large companies in the United States. Buffett's salary has not changed in 35 years. Buffett also receives approximately $300,000 worth home security services from the company annually.

Abel and Jain each receive a salary of $20 million per year, with a possible $3 million annual bonus at the discretion of Buffett.


### Annual letters and shareholders' meetings

Buffett's letters to shareholders are published annually.

Berkshire's annual shareholders' meetings, nicknamed "Woodstock for Capitalists", take place at the CHI Health Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska. Attendance generally totals over 40,000 people and the meetings last for 6 to 8 hours, with Buffett himself, as well as Abel and Jain, answering questions from shareholders.

Known for their humor and light-heartedness, the meetings typically start with a cartoon made for Berkshire shareholders.

* The 2004 cartoon featured Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of "The Warrenator" who travels through time to stop Buffett and Munger's attempt to save the world from a "mega" corporation formed by Microsoft-Starbucks-Wal-Mart. Schwarzenegger is later shown arguing in a gym with Buffett regarding Proposition 13.
* The 2006 cartoon depicted actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Nicollette Sheridan lusting after Munger.
* The 2007 cartoon included Buffett playing basketball against LeBron James.
* The 2008 cartoon depicted Charlie Munger becoming President of the United States, after which he promotes eating at Dairy Queen to relieve the effects of increased temperatures due to climate change.
* The 2009 cartoon, aired just after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, showed a new mattress, named The Nervous Nellie, which has a hidden compartment for people who prefer to hide their money in the mattress than put it in the bank.
* The 2016 cartoon featured a spoof of the 1983 film *Trading Places*; in this version, Munger and Jain along with the GEICO gecko conspire to manipulate the market for cocoa beans to affect See’s Candy.
* The 2022 cartoon featured a veterinarian who expanded his business using his American Express credit card.

In October 2010, Berkshire announced that 39-year old Todd Combs, manager of the hedge fund Castle Point Capital, would join as an investment manager.

In early 2012, 50-year-old Ted Weschler, founder of Peninsula Capital Advisors, joined Berkshire as a second investment manager.
