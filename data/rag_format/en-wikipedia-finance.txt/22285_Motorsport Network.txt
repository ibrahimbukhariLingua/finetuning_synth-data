In 2019, the company attracted two new investors, Formula 1 multiple world champion, Fernando Alonso, became a shareholder in the esport division and Formula E's founder, Alejandro Agag, to a shareholding in the organisation's electric vehicle (EV) operation.

In February 2020, Mehul Kapadia, formerly SVP Global Head of Marketing at Tata Communications, joined the company as COO.

In April 2020, the company also announced a partnership with Ferrari for an official channel on the Motorsport.tv streaming platform. This was followed by an official Mercedes Benz Motorsport channel in August 2020.

In May 2021, the company announced that it had agreed to acquire the luxury automotive marketplace duPont Registry as the centrepiece of a new division focussed on the buying and selling of supercars and luxury automobiles.

In October 2021, the company announced the promotion of Oliver Ciesla to the role of CEO.
