**Zapp Electric Vehicles (NASDAQ: ZAPP)** is a British electric motorcycle manufacturer founded in 2017, led by a team of industry experts. The company's first product, the *i300*, is an electric urban high-performance two-wheeler designed to deliver motorcycle-like performance in a step-through format (EU L3e-A2).

Zapp operates a direct-to-consumer model called DSDTC (Drop-Ship-Direct-to-Customer), through which customers can order vehicles online. Once purchased, bikes are delivered to customers' homes by certified representatives known as "Zappers," who provide inspection, service, and support throughout the ownership period.

Zapp Electric Vehicles Limited is a registered trademark in the United Kingdom and other countries.


## Zapp i300

The i300 is one of the fastest accelerating motorcycles in the market.

Zapp's Z-shaped exoskeleton also offers functional benefits, such as lowering the center of gravity and reducing overall weight, enhancing vehicle performance compared to similar models in the two-wheeler market.

The compact dimensions of the i300 are designed to improve maneuverability in urban settings. These characteristics, alongside its use of premium suspension and braking systems, support Zapp's positioning as a premium British brand with a focus on delivering performance at a competitive price.

The i300 is suitable for Europeans with an A2 Licence, as the top speed is electronically restricted to 97 km/h.

The i300 is highly modular. The website configurator offers consumers the ability to personalize their own scooter as part of the purchasing experience.

The i300 comes with an air cooled Internal Permanent Magnet Motor (IPM) producing 14 kW of peak power and 587 Nm of torque to the rear wheel.

The i300 provides instant acceleration, propelling the lightweight 90 kg scooter to a speed of 50 km/h in 2.35 seconds and 70 km/h in 4.1 seconds.

The premium mid-mounted motor provides power via a carbon fiber belt drive, replacing the chain. This gives the i300 better efficiency of power transmission, as well as requiring less maintenance.

The i300 uses a high-strength alloy load-bearing exoskeleton, a first for motorcycles. The frame is chrome-moly steel tubing. Together these create a strong and lightweight platform.

The i300 uses two removable, lightweight (6 kg each), ultra-portable, cell-to-pack configured, Li-NMC, mid-voltage (72V) battery packs. Each battery is rated at 1.25 kWh. They can be used individually or in tandem to create a total energy amount of 2.5 kWh. The batteries can be charged via any universal/domestic 110/220/250V plug-in sockets.

The company intends to sell the model in the UK, Thailand as well as India, where local manufacturer Bounce Electric 1 will handle production and sales.
