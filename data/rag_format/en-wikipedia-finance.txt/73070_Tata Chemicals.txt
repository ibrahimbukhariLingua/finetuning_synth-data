## History and operations

Tata Chemicals has the third largest soda ash production capacity plant in India. This was the second soda ash plant built in India by Kapilram Vakil (grandson of late Indian justice Nanabhai Haridas) that started operating in the year 1944. The township Mithapur, derives its name from "Mitha" which means salt in Gujarati language.

Since 2006, Tata Chemicals has owned Brunner Mond, a United Kingdom-based chemical company with operations in Magadi (Kenya). On 27 March 2008, Tata Chemicals Ltd acquired General Chemical of US. With all these acquisitions, combined capacity of production has increased to around 5.17 million tons of soda ash.

In April 2010, Tata Chemicals acquired 25% stake in ammonia-urea fertilizer complex in Gabon for US$290 million. The first phase of the plant will have a full operational capacity of 2.2 billion tons of ammonia and 3.85 billion tons of urea per day.

In 2016, Tata Chemicals sold its urea business to Pune-based Yara India, part of the Norwegian chemical company, Yara International.

In 2019, Tata Group transferred Tata Chemicals' branded food business to Tata Global Beverages (now Tata Consumer Products), in an all-share deal.

In 2022, Tata Chemicals, through its subsidiary Tata Chemicals Europe, set up the UK's first industrial-scale carbon capture and usage plant. The plant can capture 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum.
