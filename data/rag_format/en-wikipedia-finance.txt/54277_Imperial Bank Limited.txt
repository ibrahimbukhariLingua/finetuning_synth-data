Imperial Bank Limited


# Imperial Bank Limited



**Imperial Bank Limited** commonly known as **Imperial Bank**, is a commercial bank in Kenya, the largest economy in the East African Community. It is one of the forty-three commercial banks licensed by the Central Bank of Kenya, the central bank and national banking regulator.

On 13 October 2015, the Central Bank of Kenya placed Imperial Bank under the management and control of the state's Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation because of what the Central Bank termed as "unsafe and unsound business conditions" at the Bank. Separately, sources said an internal fraud scheme had occasioned the move.

The Central Bank of Kenya had hoped that owners of Imperial Bank would inject cash into the institution but has recently lamented that the shareholders had failed to make good on their promise.

Depositors of the troubled bank can now make their claims at any Central Bank of Kenya or Diamond Trust Bank Group branch and such claims will take three days to confirm their details before they are paid.

## Recent Developments

On 21 June 2016, the Central Bank of Kenya appointed NIC Bank as asset and liabilities consultant for Imperial Bank (in receivership). Effectively, NIC Bank took over the responsibility of returning funds to the failed bank's deposit customers. The agreement also allows NIC to acquire some of the deposits, assets and liabilities of Imperial once its receiver manager the Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation starts liquidating the bank.

On 11 January 2017, IBL Depositors Lobby Group (a collaboration of investors affected by the continuously delayed and fraudulent Imperial Bank receivership of October 2015, drafted an open letter to the Central Bank of Kenya and Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation (responsible for the receivership mandate) requesting a final statement regarding the ruling from Millimani Law Courts dated 4 November 2016 stating that 40% of the outstanding funds can and should be paid out to the effected parties awaiting their dues.

24 March 2017, Central Bank of Kenya extends the receivership for another 90 days expressing that the handlers of the receivership (Kenya Deposit Insurance Corporation) require more time.

3 May 2017, NIC Bank completes its process with assisting on the Imperial Bank Limited investigation and pay out structure.
