## History

Only two years after the creation of the State of Israel in *1948* wave of aliyah immigration drove the government to encourage new industries. In 1950, a tire manufacturer plant named *Samson* was founded in Petah Tikva by General Tire and Rubber Company. A few executives from the Solel Boneh company decided to open a competing company and later that year, with know-how from the "Dayton Tire and Rubber Company" (since bought by Bridgestone), Alliance was founded. Dayton was owned by A. L. Friedlander, for which the street the company is located on has been named. Friedlander, a Jewish zionist was excited about the venture and managed to raise funds from fifteen other enthusiastic American Jews who would share a 49% stake. In 1971, Alliance acquired Samson.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Alliance originally produced pneumatic tires for cars but in the 1960s, it started offering tractor tires, an area that would become its expertise. During the Cold War, the company exported to the Eastern Bloc indirectly through Cuba. In 1983, Koor became the major shareholder of Alliance. From 1988 to 1992, the company operated under the Official Receiver of the State of Israel, under a program similar to Chapter 11 in the United States. The recovery plan succeeded and the company returned to profitability in 1990. In 1992, Alliance's assets and operations were sold to new owners, "Fishman Holding" of Israel, and U. Zucker and Bear Stearns of the U.S. and in 1993, Alliance went public on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange floating 10%.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2007, the Mahansaria family with the support of Warburg Pincus acquired Alliance Tires Company of Israel which owned the brand 'Alliance' to form Alliance Tire Group.
