He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Yale University and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.


## Career

McNamee has worked for numerous employers during his career.


### T. Rowe Price

McNamee joined T. Rowe Price as an analyst in 1982, after receiving his M.B.A. from the Tuck School of Business.

By 1989 he was leading the firm's Science & Technology Fund, a period when the fund returned about 17% annually to investors. In a move atypical for mutual funds, he made venture capital investments in Electronic Arts (which went public in 1989) and Sybase (which had its IPO in 1991).


### Integral Capital Partners

In 1991 McNamee co-founded Integral Capital Partners with John Powell and venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins to invest in expansion stage private companies and growth-stage public companies.


### Silver Lake Partners

In 1999, McNamee was one of the founding partners of leveraged buyout firm Silver Lake Partners.


### Elevation Partners

In 2004, McNamee co-founded Elevation Partners along with a number of other investors including U2 frontman Bono. He currently serves as its managing director. Elevation Partners investments have included Palm, Inc., Forbes, and Facebook.


## Music career

McNamee is also a musician. He played in the band Flying Other Brothers from 1997 to 2006. His current band, Moonalice, formed in 2007 after acclaimed producer T Bone Burnett approached McNamee about creating a new band in the spirit of the San Francisco psychedelic era. Roger has written for, and played guitar, bass, and vocals in the band since 2007, using the stage persona of "Chubby Wombat Moonalice." In 2014 he formed a duo with Jason Crosby called the Doobie Decibel System. In 2015, The Doobie Brothers sued the band over the name.

McNamee appeared in the 2021 award-winning documentary, The Tale of the Dog, which chronicles the outsized historical impact that the Denver music venue, The Family Dog Denver, had on the changing city.


## Music and technology

With Elevation Partners "perhaps best known for its early investment in Facebook," McNamee said in 2013, for him, “music and technology have converged.”

> He became expert on Facebook by using it to promote ... Moonalice, and now is focusing on video by live-streaming its concerts. He says musicians and top professionals share “the almost desperate need to dive deep.” This capacity to obsess seems to unite top performers in music and other fields.

McNamee is the co-writer of the Moonalice song "It's 4:20 Somewhere". In August 2012 the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced that the digital logs for "It’s 4:20 Somewhere" had been acquired for its library and archives, describing the Moonalice logs as helping to "...tell the story of music’s digital revolution; specifically the rise of direct-from-artist (DFA) distribution. Moonalice is the first band without a label to achieve one million downloads of a song from its own servers, direct-from-artist. “It’s 4:20 Somewhere” has been downloaded over 4.6 million times".


## Antitrust enforcement policy

McNamee has expressed his support for tougher antitrust enforcement policies in the US and internationally, particularly as it relates to leading technology firms, supporting the antitrust enforcement actions by the DOJ and the FTC led by Lina Khan under President Biden’s administration which has taken a tougher stance on blocking anticompetitive mergers.


## Relationship with Wikipedia

According to *The New York Times*, McNamee has been instrumental in arranging at least two $500,000 donations to the Wikimedia Foundation. Roger McNamee is a member of the Wikipedia Foundation's advisory board, and acts "as a special advisor to the executive director on business and strategy issues."


## Influence

Bill Gates wrote in his book *The Road Ahead*: "Roger was a great sounding board for many of the ideas I wrote about". Mark Zuckerberg (who met McNamee in summer 2006 at a time when Facebook reportedly had buyout offers of around $750 million) said McNamee was "emphatic" that Facebook not be sold; Zuckerberg stated he "clearly cared about building something long-term and about the impact of the things we build as opposed to just making money in the short term," advice that Portfolio.com called "prescient": in October 2007, Facebook sold just 1.6 percent of the company to Microsoft for $240 million. McNamee himself confirmed that.

In the autumn of 2017 McNamee met with US legislators who were preparing to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections. McNamee had prepared for them a curriculum, stating that the real problem was the divisions social media platforms were creating among Americans, of which Adam Schiff, member of the House Intelligence Committee said, "Roger was really ahead of the curve. Time has borne out his warnings."


## Haight Street Art Center

McNamee has been heavily involved in the creation of the Haight Street Art Center which celebrates San Francisco's tradition of music-related poster art. He donated $1 million to help fund the center, and has committed an additional $1 million to help keep it operating.


## Criticism of Facebook

An early investor in Facebook, McNamee became very critical of its impact on society and democracy, as expressed in his op-eds for *USA Today* and *The Guardian*. Earlier, on CNBC, he said that he had tried to warn Facebook about the impact of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections. He has also been interviewed by NPR on the topic. As part of this effort, McNamee joined the Center for Humane Technology as a founding advisor.
In May 2019, he appeared before the House of Commons privacy and ethics committee in Ottawa, calling for governments to temporarily shut down Facebook and other social media sites until they reform. On 25 September 2020, McNamee was named as one of the 25 members of the "Real Facebook Oversight Board", an independent monitoring group over Facebook.
