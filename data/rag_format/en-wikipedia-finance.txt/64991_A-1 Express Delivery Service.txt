The company also pairs human valueᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and Internet tools such as with local bike messenger services that use Internet features in an effort to save resources for customers and time during heavy traffic.

In 2005, A-1 Express Delivery Services, Inc. added specialty services such as the Less-Than-Truckload shipping services.
