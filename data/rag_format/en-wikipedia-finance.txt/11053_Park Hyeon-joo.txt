## Biography

Park was born on October 17, 1958 in Gwangju, South Korea. In 1977, he graduated from Gwangju Jeil High School. In 1983, he graduated from Korea University with a bachelor's in business administration.

In 1986, he joined Dongyang Securities (동양증권; now part of Yuanta Securities). In 1991, he became branch manager of Dongwon Securities (동원증권; now part of Korea Investment & Securities [ko]). In 1996, he was made director of the Gangnam branch of Dongwon Securities.

On July 18, 1997, he cofounded Mirae Asset Investment Advisory and Mirae Asset Global Investments, along with eight colleagues from the securities industry. The company was the first professional asset management company in Korean history. In December 1998, he established the first mutual fund in the country, which was called "Park Hyeon-joo No. 1" (박현주1호). The mutual fund quickly proved to be extremely popular, and sold out within hours of its launch. In 2001, he became the chairman of Mirae Asset Group. The company began expanding internationally beginning in 2004.

In 2009, Harvard Business School created a case study on Park and his experience at Mirae Asset. Beginning in 2010, he began donating all his received dividends to talent development and social welfare programs through his foundation, the Mirae Asset Park Hyeon Joo Foundation.

In 2020, a subcompany of Mirae Asset, the vast majority of which was held by Park and his family (91.86%), was fined for unfair transactions that benefitted the owners of the company. Park did not receive any criminal charges for this, as Park did not order the transaction.


## Personal life

He is married to Kim Mi-gyeong (김미경). The couple have children Park Ha-min (박하민), Park Eun-min (박은민), and Park Jun-beom (박준범). Their three children have each studied in the United States.
