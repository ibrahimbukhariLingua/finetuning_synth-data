## History

Nixon Williams was founded in 1995 by Alan Williams and Andy Nixon in Chorley. The firm was set up with the view of serving professionals and expanded as the firm started to acquire more clients nationwide via word-of-mouth.

After 19 years at the organisation, both founders stepped down when the business was acquired by Sovereign Capital, a specialist UK private equity firm. Andy Nixon and Alan Williams have since invested in a new practice, Alchemy Accountancy, which was launched in 2018.

In 2017 Nixon Williams became a brand within the Optionis group.
