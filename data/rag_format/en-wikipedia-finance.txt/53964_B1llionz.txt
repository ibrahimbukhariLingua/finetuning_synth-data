## Production

M1llionz broke through at the end of 2019 with his song "North-West", and he also released the anthem "Y Pree" at the start of 2020, but B1llionz was the first single to make an impact on the UK charts. The lyrics tell the story of how M1llionz's life has changed since his rapid career rise, and the money that has come along with it. The music video was shot by director Teeeezy C, who had also produced videos for Digga D and Nafe Smallz. The song achieved over 890,000 streams on its first week of release.
