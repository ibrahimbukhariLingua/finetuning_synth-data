## Career

In 2008, Sheffield founded Parsley Energy, taking over 109 old wells that his grandfather Joe Parsley had drilled in the Midland, Texas area. He had no previous experience in the energy business, just "family connections" and a "trader's taste for risk".

Sheffield donated more than $1 million to Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.
