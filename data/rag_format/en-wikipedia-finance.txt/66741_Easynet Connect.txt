## Network

Easynet marketed local loop unbundling (LLU) in the UK in 2001, and was the first to challenge BT in the wholesale broadband market when it announced its 8 Mbit/s service in 2004. The company claimed the 2nd largest core network in the UK (6,030 km of fibre in 2009), while the majority of its services are delivered via copper connections in the last mile.

Easynet marketed bonded DSL in the UK and was the first UK ISP to offer bonded FTTC (also known as VDSL) which it markets as EtherStream V. Country-wide coverage of EtherStream V is currently limited to areas where FTTC is available but can deliver broadband speeds of up to 320 Mbit/s downstream and up to 80 Mbit/s upstream.
