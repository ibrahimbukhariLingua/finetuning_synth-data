8 Bishopsgate


# 8 Bishopsgate



**8 Bishopsgate** is a 51-storey, 204-metre (669 ft) tall commercial skyscraper located in the City of London financial district. When it opened in 2023, it was the 11th-tallest building in London. Situated on the corner of Bishopsgate and Leadenhall Street, it neighbours two taller skyscrapers, 122 Leadenhall Street and 22 Bishopsgate. It has a free viewing gallery on the 50th floor.


## History


### Previous building

The current skyscraper replaced 6–8 Bishopsgate, a 79 m (259 ft) tall office building that was the headquarters of Barings Bank up until the bank collapsed in 1995. Barings Bank had been based at 8 Bishopsgate since 1806, the building undergoing several expansions and refurbishments up until it was replaced by a high-rise. Designed by GMW Architects, construction started in 1977 and took four years. The building opened in 1981 and was in use until 2019.


### Planning

The original contested scheme for 8 Bishopsgate was submitted in 2015. The skyscraper was designed to be 'visually striking', incorporating high-quality warm building materials such as wood and marble to welcome visitors inside.

The building was constructed as part of a wave of high-rise development in the Bishopsgate area, caused by growing demand for office space in the City of London.

Demolition work on the previous buildings began in mid-2018, with construction work beginning on the new building in 2019. The skyscraper opened in 2023, and includes a free viewing platform, The Look Out, located on the 50th floor.
