## History

The Toowoomba Permanent Building Society was formed in 1875 and 1893 recorded a record profit. In 1897 Darling Downs Building Society launched and by 1914 had become the largest building society in Queensland. Over the next 20 years, the two building societies continued to grow and alternated as the largest building society in Queensland.

In 1934, Toowoomba Permanent Building Society moved its head office from Russell Street to a site at the corner of Russell and Neil Streets, Toowoomba where it remained for 43 years. Darling Downs Building Society's head office was located nearby Margaret Street, Toowoomba (1954) before moving to Ruthven Street, Toowoomba in 1971.

In 1981, Toowoomba Permanent Building Society and Darling Downs Building Society merged to form the Heritage Building Society, and in 1983 the head office moved to the newly constructed Heritage Plaza at 400 Ruthven Street, Toowoomba where it still sits today. Assets of the Heritage Building Society passed the $1 billion mark in 1995, the $4 billion mark in 2003, the $7 billion mark in 2009, and exceeded the $10 billion mark in 2019.

The first community branch for Heritage opened in Crows Nest in 1999, with a further six branches opening over the coming years.

In 2011, the organisation changed its name to Heritage Bank.

In 2018, it was announced that Heritage would expand its branch operations outside of Queensland for the first time, and in October 2019 the first branch opened in Castle Hill, New South Wales. As a part of this expansion, the Heritage Bank logo was also updated to remove the stylised "gates" that were a part of the original logo.

In August 2021, Heritage Bank entered discussions with People's Choice Credit Union about a potential merger, and in April 2022 both companies announced that they planned to merge, subject to a vote of the membership.
Members gave their approval on 16 November 2022.

The new combined organisation was named Heritage and People's Choice Ltd and operates under the banking licence held by People's Choice Credit Union.

Announced in November 2023, the new bank is called People First Bank.

### Community branches

Heritage currently has seven community branches located in Highfields, Crows Nest, Millmerran, Karalee, Forest Lake, Nanango and Palmwoods.

The community banking model is based on the formation of a community-based company made up of a range of investors from the immediate area where a branch is to be established. Heritage then partners with this company to form a joint venture. Joint venture company directors act in a voluntary capacity. Both Heritage and the company contribute to the set-up costs and share ongoing expenses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Profits are shared and the company can distribute its share of profits back into the community to support charities, sporting clubs and other local organisations through grant funding.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Calendar House

Every year, Heritage releases a calendar which features a painting of an architecturally and historically important house in Queensland. A brief history of the home is also included on the calendar. The aim is to recognise and celebrate the finest examples of excellence in Queensland's domestic architecture. The first edition of the calendar was released in 1982.
