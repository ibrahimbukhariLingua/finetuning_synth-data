The company traces its origin to the founding of Ceylon Insurance Company by Hugh C. Weeresekere in 1939. Due to an illness, Weeresekere left the company to Justin Kotelawala, who managed the company for 25 years. The insurance industry in Sri Lanka was a state monopoly from its nationalisation in the 1960s to 1988. Prior to the independence of Sri Lanka, the industry was dominated by the private sector and the industry was led by Ceylon Insurance Company. In 1987, Ceylon Insurance Company was renamed Ceylinco Ltd. and incorporated as a limited liability company.
