Spotify and unions


# Spotify and unions



The subscription music streaming service Spotify employs 7,500 employees globally as of December 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ. Spotify recognizes trade unions at its US podcasting subsidiaries Ringer and Spotify Studios since 2019. In Germany, a works council was established in 2023. Swedish trade unions have unsuccessfully attempted to bargain collectively with Spotify since 2023.


## Germany

Spotify GmbH employees in Berlin elected an electoral board in February 2023, a precursor to establishing a works council. On 21 April 2023, employees elected a works council.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Sweden

Spotify AB does not recognize any trade unions or have any collective agreements in Sweden. Spotify ended joint-negotiations with the three trade unions Unionen, Engineers of Sweden and Akavia [sv] (affiliate of SACO) in August 2023. Several months prior, in May 2023, the three unions petitioned Spotify to begin negotiating. 90% of Swedish workers are covered by collective agreements. In tech companies it is less common. Swedish labor disputes are also happening at Tesla and Klarna as of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ.

In November 2022, Henry Catalini Smith, a Spotify engineer in Malmö, set up the channel #kollektivavtal in the internal company Slack, which means "collective agreement" in Swedish. The channel grew to 2,000 participants. 700 employees have since joined Unionen, with another 100 each joining Engineers of Sweden and Akavia. Catalini Smith no longer works at Spotify.


## United States

Writers Guild of America, East represents two union affiliates at Spotify Studios and The Ringer.

The United Musicians and Allied Workers campaigns for a fairer redistribution and compensation system for musicians. The United Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) was established in 2020 during the onset of the Corona pandemic. One year later in 31 cities worldwide, 27,500 musicians joined UMAW's campaign #JusticeAtSpotify to demand a compensation of one cent per audio stream. Moreover, they are asking for a fairer redistribution system, as smaller artists are disproportionately disadvantaged on Spotify.

One month after Spotify acquired Gimlet Media in February 2019, 75% of staff at Gimlet Media went public, signing union cards and seeking voluntary recognition.

In August 2019, Ringer's editorial staff voted to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East. The union was voluntarily recognized by Ringer management four days later. On 5 February 2020, subscription music streaming service Spotify announced it was acquiring The Ringer, and inheriting the previously established union.

Spotify acquired Parcast in March 2019. In September 2020, Parcast workers went public with their union drive. A month later, Spotify voluntarily recognized the Parcast union.

In April 2021, writers and producers ratified their first collective agreement with Gimlet Media and Ringer. It would last 3 years, with minimum base salary of $57,000 for Ringer staff and $73,000 for Gimlet producers. There was no provision regarding worker ownership of content created.

In April 2022, after 15 months of bargaining, the Parcast union consisting of 56 workers ratified their first collective agreement, which included a minimum salary of $70,000, annual increases and affirmative action while hiring.

In March 2024, The Writers Guild of America, East ratified a collective agreement with Ringer and Spotify Studios (Spotify Studios was formed as a merger of Gimlet Media, Parcast and their respective unions) which increased minimum base salaries to $65,000, protections for migrant employees and included safe-guards against usage of Artificial Intelligence to create "digital replicas" of their voices.
