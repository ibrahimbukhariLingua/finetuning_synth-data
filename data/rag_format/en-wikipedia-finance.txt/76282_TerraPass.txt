# TerraPass



**TerraPass** is a social enterprise that provides carbon offsetting products. TerraPass use proceeds from member purchases to fund greenhouse gas reduction projects.


## Carbon portfolio

TerraPass's projects is divided into four project types, all based in the United States:

* Wind energy – TerraPass purchased Green-e-certified wind Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from wind farms and calculates the carbon reduction from these RECs based on the EPA eGRID methodology.
* Farm methane digesters (or "Farm Power") – TerraPass funds emissions reductions from digesters that collect the methane from animal manure on dairy farms and burn it, which often generates renewable energy.

* Landfill methane flaring – TerraPass funds reductions from landfill flaring of methane, collected from decomposing garbage.

* Clean energy – TerraPass funds wind energy after calculating the "environmental gains" with the “carbon profile” of the electricity grid.
