Genesis Energy Limited


# Genesis Energy Limited



**Genesis Energy Limited**, formerly **Genesis Power Limited** is a New Zealand publicly listed electricity generation and electricity, natural gas and LPG retailing company. It was formed as part of the 1998–99 reform of the New Zealand electricity sector, taking its generation capacity from the breakup of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) and taking retail customers from three local power boards in the Lower North Island. The New Zealand Government owns a 51% share of the company.

Genesis Energy is the largest electricity and natural gas retailer in New Zealand with 26% and 39% market share respectively in the 2015–2016 financial year. In 2015, Genesis produced 14% of New Zealand's electricity, and is the third largest electricity generating company in New Zealand in terms of MW capacity, GWh generation and revenue (see comparison table at New Zealand electricity market).


## History

Genesis Energy began business on 1 April 1999, after the reform of the New Zealand electricity market and the breakup of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ). It took over the Huntly Power Station, Tongariro Power Scheme and Waikaremoana Hydro Scheme from ECNZ, and the Hau Nui Wind Farm and the Kourarau Hydro Scheme from Wairarapa Electricity. It also inherited the retail arms of Powerco, Central Power and Wairarapa Electricity, while Powerco and Central Power concentrated on electricity distribution (the distribution arm of Wairarapa Electricity merged with Powerco on the same day).

During 2000 to 2002 Genesis Energy purchased several electricity and gas retailing entities, following changes to laws governing the electricity industry. These included electricity retail businesses of Todd Energy, and electricity and gas customers from NGC (now Vector Limited) and Energy Online.

In September 2013, the company announced a change of name from Genesis Power Limited to Genesis Energy Limited.

On 17 April 2014, the National Government sold a 49% stake in Genesis Energy through an initial public offering at NZ$1.55 per share.

In February 2018, Genesis Energy announced a pathway to a coal-free electricity future for New Zealand by 2030.

In 2024, the company downgraded the reserves at Kupe by 81 petajoules of gas resulting in a $64 million writedown. This, along with other factors including a power station outage, resulted in a steep decline in profits although revenue was up.


## Power stations

Genesis Energy owns and operates a diverse portfolio of assets that includes hydroelectric, thermal and wind generation.

Genesis Energy operates three hydroelectric generating stations on the (361.8 MW) Tongariro Power Scheme – Rangipo (120 MW), Tokaanu (240 MW) and Mangaio (1.8 MW). It also operates the (138 MW) Lake Waikaremoana hydro scheme, comprising the Tuai (60 MW), Kaitawa (36 MW) and Piripaua (42 MW) stations.

On 1 June 2011, Genesis Energy purchased Tekapo A (27 MW) and B (160 MW) hydroelectric power stations from Meridian Energy.

Genesis Energy operates the Huntly Power Station, a (953 MW) coal- and gas-fired thermal plant on the Waikato River. In addition to two gas/coal-fired generating units, Huntly has a 50 MW open-cycle gas turbine unit that runs as base load, and a (403 MW) combined cycle gas turbine commissioned in June 2007 as a NZ$500 million project. Huntly also has a third coal unit, which can be taken out of storage within 90 days. The coal units are mainly used as hydro firming when New Zealand is in a dry winter.

The first of the four coal-fired units at the Huntly Power Station was taken out of service in late 2012. A second unit was placed into long-term storage in December 2013 and permanently retired in June 2015.

The company also operates the (7.3 MW) Hau Nui windfarm in the North Island.

### Future generation developments


#### Castle Hill

Genesis Energy has resource consents for a wind farm at Castle Hill, 20 km north-east of Masterton in the northern Wairarapa. It is planning up to 286 turbines over a 30 km² (12 sq mi) area, with a total installed capacity of up to 860 MW and potentially generating over 2000 GWh per year.


#### Slopedown Wind Farm

In 2010, Genesis Energy purchased the Slopedown wind from Wind Prospect CWP Ltd. It is 15 km east of Wyndham. Genesis Energy has not yet applied for resource consents.


## Community and sustainability investments


### Science Based Targets

Genesis has created Science Based Targets to align their sustainability goals to. They aim to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 36% and reduce scope 3 emissions 21%.


### School-gen and School-gen Trust

Genesis Energy began its School-gen programme in 2006 to teach students about solar power, renewable energy and energy efficiency. The School-gen programme has created extensive teaching resources, including Maker Projects and eBooks that are free for any school in New Zealand. It has also provided 92 New Zealand schools with either a 2, 4 or 6 kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) solar panel system, at no cost to the schools. The largest solar array on a School-gen school is 16 kilowatts on Vauxhall School in Auckland. The PV system allows these schools to generate a portion of their electricity from the sun while also teaching students about solar energy.


### Duffy Books in Schools

Duffy Books in Homes aims to encourage reading and supports students in lower socio-economic areas where the children are more likely to come from homes without access to books.


### Whio Forever Project

Genesis Energy has partnered with the New Zealand Department of Conservation to help save the endangered native *whio* or blue duck. The Whio Forever Project includes a national recovery plan that will double the number of fully operational secure breeding sites throughout New Zealand and boost pest control efforts.


### Curtain Bank

Genesis Energy is the major sponsor of the Wellington Curtain Bank and the Christchurch Curtain Bank. The curtain banks take donated second-hand curtains or fabric and re-cut and line them for distribution to households in need. This helps households in saving money on their energy bills and to create warmer, healthier homes. Some retailers offer a service in which they take down and donate your old curtains when installing new ones.
