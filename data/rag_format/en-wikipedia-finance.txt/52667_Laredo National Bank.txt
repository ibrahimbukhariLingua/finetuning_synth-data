# Laredo National Bank



The **Laredo National Bank (LNB)** was a Texas bank founded in 1892 headquartered in Laredo, Texas which was bought by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria. LNB had been a component in the development of business and industry along the United States-Mexico border and South Texas. The Laredo National Bank had grown to approximately $3.5 billion in assets and was the fifth largest independent bank in Texas. Headquartered in Laredo, Texas, LNB had branches in Austin, Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Harlingen, Houston, McAllen, San Antonio, San Marcos, and Weslaco. Laredo National Bank owned South Texas National Bank. Laredo National Bank's branches and headquarters names have been changed to Compass Bank on November 14, 2008 due to a merger between Laredo National Bank Compass and BBVA. BBVA Compass plans on cutting 170 jobs and eliminating the Laredo National Bank headquarters.
