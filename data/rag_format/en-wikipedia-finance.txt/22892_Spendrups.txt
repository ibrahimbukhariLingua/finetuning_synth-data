**Spendrups Bryggeri AB** is a Swedish brewery known as Grängesbergs Bryggeri AB until 1983. The company includes the subsidiaries Spring Wine & Spirits, Gotlands Bryggeri and Hellefors Bryggeri. Spendrups Group has approximately 900 employees and sales revenue of approximately 3 billion Swedish kronor.

The head office is located in Stockholm, and the company runs four breweries, in Grängesberg, Hällefors, Visby (the micro brewery Gotlands Bryggeri AB), and Stockholm (the micro brewery OMAKA).


## History

In 1923, the Danish brewer Louis Spendrup acquired Grängesbergs Bryggeri in Dalecarlia. His son Jens Fredrik Spendrup took over the company in 1950. In 1967, Mariestads Bryggeri, a large brewery in Mariestad, was acquired. Jens and Ulf Spendrup, the sons of Jens Fredrik Spendrup, became chief executives of Grängesbergs Bryggeri in 1976.

The brewery launched a beer called "Spendrups" at Operakällaren in Stockholm in 1979. In 1982, Grängesbergs Bryggeri AB changed its name to Spendrups Bryggeri AB, and the brewery was listed on the stock exchange in 1983. The company withdrew from the stock market in 2001.

In 1989, Spendrups purchased Kooperativa Förbundets brewing operations consisting of Wårby Bryggerier located on the outskirts of Stockholm and Sollefteå Bryggeri (presently Zeunerts brewery). Among others, the brand Norrlands Guld was included in the purchase. The brewery in Sollefteå, where Norrlands Guld was originally brewed was shut down and sold, whereas Vårby brewery was retained.

The abolishment of the state wine and liquor monopoly occurred in 1995, as a result of Sweden's entry into the European Union (EU), thus allowing Spendrups to import and distribute wine. In 2001, the company started liquor distribution, as well as licensed production of Heineken. In 2009, Spendrups included the brand Schweppes in its product portfolio.

Henrik Åström has been CEO since September 2024. He succeeded Fredrik Spendrup.
