Electricity sector in Bulgaria


# Electricity sector in Bulgaria



The **electricity sector in Bulgaria** is an important part of energy in Bulgaria and is highly diversified. As of 2021 nuclear power accounts for 34.7% of Bulgaria's power, coal power provides 39.4%, while renewable energy provides 15.8% of the country's electricity needs.


## Power production

Bulgaria consumes about 35 TWh of electricity per year, and some is exported. The residential sector is the largest consumer, followed by industry then services.


### Nuclear power


### Coal power

Some power stations are very dirty, and in 2023 one was found guilty of excess sulphur dioxide air pollution, which might lead to court cases against others.

In early 2023 the government attempted to postpone Bulgaria's EU commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% that year, because it did not want to close any coal-fired power stations.

Fossil fuel subsidy of coal power is expected to end by 2025. Bulgaria aims to phase out coal power (which is low quality lignite) by 2038 or earlier. The Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air says that an earlier phase out would save many lives and much money.
