## Early life and education

Peter Sands was born in the UK on 8 January 1962 to British parents who had themselves been born in Asia. His father, was born in Malaya, a British colony until 1957, where his grandfather ran rubber plantations for the London Asiatic Rubber and Produce Co and his mother was born in India, another former British colonial outpost.

Sands was taken to Malaysia as a baby and spent much of his life outside Britain, mostly in Malaysia and Singapore. He was educated at Crown Woods Comprehensive School in London, and the United World College of the Pacific in British Columbia, Canada, before he went to Oxford.

Sands graduated with a BA degree from Brasenose College at Oxford in 1984. He started as a trainee at UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which he left to take a Harkness Fellowship at Harvard University to earn a master's degree in public administration from Kennedy School of Government.


## Career


### McKinsey, 1988–2002

In 1988, Sands started his career as a consultant for the management consulting firm, McKinsey in its London office. He held positions of increasing responsibilities in the firm, and in 1996 he became a partner, and later in 2000 rose to position of a director.


### Standard Chartered, 2002–2015

In 2002, Standard Chartered PLC, a client of McKinsey, hired Sands as its Group Finance Director. Four years later in 2006, he was chosen as its Group Chief Executive Officer.

Between 2002 and 2008, the headcount of Standard Chartered nearly doubled to 70,000. The British bank rescue plan, which was copied around the world, was based on a blueprint devised by Sands. Standard Chartered itself did not take "any taxpayer money or used any central bank liquidity schemes".

Also during his time at the bank, Sands was harshly criticized after Standard Chartered paid New York State $340 million in 2012 to settle claims it laundered money for Iran.

In February 2015, amidst growing shareholder calls for his resignation, Sands announced that he would be stepping down as CEO, effective June 2015. At the time of the announcement, the *Wall Street Journal* noted that Sands, having served at the helm of Standard Chartered for nine years, was among the "longest-serving chiefs of a major Western bank." On 26 February 2015, it was announced that his successor would be Bill Winters, former co-CEO of JP Morgan's investment banking business.

After leaving Standard Chartered, Sands was a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government of the Harvard John F. Kennedy School of Government and became the lead non-executive board member of the Department of Health in the United Kingdom.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 2016, he also chaired the International Commission on a Global Health Risk Framework for the Future under the auspices of the National Academy of Medicine.


### Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, 2017-current

In November 2017, Sands was appointed to lead the Global Fund and started in the role in early 2018.
