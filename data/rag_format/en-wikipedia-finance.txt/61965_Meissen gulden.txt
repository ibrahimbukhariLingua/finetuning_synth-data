Meissen gulden


# Meissen gulden



The **Meissen *gulden*** (German: *Meißnische Gulden*, *Meißner Gulden* or *Gulden Meißnisch*), abbreviation **Mfl.**, was a Rhenish Gold Gulden that was established in Saxony in 1490 at a value of 21 *groschen* and which, from 1542 to 1838 became a coin of account (a notional accounting gulden) of the same value.

When the Saxon *Guldengroschen* (silver *gulden*, *thaler* coins), which had had the same value as the gold *gulden* since 1500, were set at 24 *groschen* in 1542, the Meissen *gulden* remained in use in Saxony as an accounting coin at 21 *groschen* until the 19th century.


## Explanation

The Meissen *gulden* used as an accounting coin up until the 19th century goes back to the Saxon coinage regulations of 9 August 1490, according to which the gold *gulden* in Saxony was reduced to 21 *groschen* (*Spitzgroschen*) (gold *Guldengroschen* = 1:21 - see *Bartgroschen*). /ref>
