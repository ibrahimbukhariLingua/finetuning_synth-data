## History

Sapiens grew out of an initiative, dubbed DB1, undertaken by a group of scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science during the 1970s to develop a novel object-oriented application generator for use with mainframe computers. In 1972, Tsvi Misinai, a graduate of the Technion, started the project. He teamed up with Shai Sole, Shmuel Timor, and Eli Raban. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Weizmann team, partnered with a local Israeli company, Advanced Automated Applications (AAA, which was founded by Tuvi Orbach).

In 1984, the Weizmann team established its own company, which was later merged with AAA and joined by entrepreneurs Ron Zuckerman and Shaul Shani. The company severed itself from the Weizmann Institute and was incorporated under its new name: Sapiens.

In 1992, shares of Sapiens began trading on the NASDAQ exchange. By 1993, Sapiens had 900 workers employed at 33 branches around the world and a market cap of $340 million.

During the latter half of the 1990s, Sapiens focused on developing a business rules technology (eMerge) and legacy modernization products and services. The company was involved in updating information systems to deal with the Year 2000 problem and to adapt systems to the changeover to the new single European currency (the Euro). In 1999, Sapiens' annual revenues reached $91 million.
