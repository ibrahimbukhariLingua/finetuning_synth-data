### Senate hearing

On September 24, 2024, Jørgensen appeared before the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor, and Pensions to defend Ozempic and Wegovy drug pricing. The committee, led by Bernie Sanders, reiterated the point that drug prices should be substantially lowered. Jørgensen reiterated that pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs, lower coverage when prices have a lower list price, thus making the access to the drugs harder for individuals. Sanders claimed three of the top PBMs promised to not reduce access if prices are lowered, however, Jørgensen had his doubts to these claims. Jørgensen reiterated that he will support any effort to help patients access the drug. Roger Marshall, a physician, sided with Novo Nordisk and showed sympathy saying Novo Nordisk "is not a villain in this story, they're a hero."
