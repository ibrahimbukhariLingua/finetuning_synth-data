## History

*Bisnis Indonesia* opened its first office in a former Singer's sewing machine service center at Jalan Kramat V/8, Central Jakarta. The newspaper gained its momentum from the rise of the stock market in 1987 and a new policy in banking known as *Paket Oktober* (Pakto) 1988. *Bisnis Indonesia* shifted their coverage to focus on micro-economics and business news at a time when most competitors were reporting heavily on macro-economics issue. This strategy proved fruitful as the stock exchange authority ordered all public listed companies to publish their financial reports and corporate actions.
