### Sing Tao Holdings

Circa 1989 a Bermuda-incorporated company **Sing Tao Holdings Limited** replaced Sing Tao Limited as the holding company of the group. At the same time, Cereus Australia, the investment vehicle Aw used to privatise Sing Tao in 1985, was delisted on the Australian Securities Exchange in the same year by Kargat Pty Limited. The ex-parent company was engaged in property investment in Sydney.

According to a book published by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, citing a document that Sing Tao Holdings was a diversified conglomerate already in 1989, which only 7.7% revenue was from the newspaper despite 50% investments were newspaper related.³⁶

The company published the *Sing Tao Daily*, the oldest surviving Chinese language daily newspaper in Hong Kong, which is also published overseas editions in New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, London, Paris, Sydney and Melbourne.³⁹ The first edition was published in 1938.

Toronto Star Newspapers also acquired 75% stake of Canada-incorporated Sing Tao Daily Limited, the publisher of Canada edition.


#### Sing Tao management found guilty of fudging circulation numbers

In 1998, members of the management team were found guilty of falsifying circulation numbers for *The Standard* newspaper, to attract advertisers and to raise the revenue of the newspapers. According to a report by the Center for International Media Assistance, the circulation of *Sing Tao Daily* and most major Beijing-friendly Chinese newspapers with overseas editions were remain unaudited, and therefore vulnerable to exaggeration:

> Jack Jia, founder of the Toronto-based semiweekly *Chinese News*, known for its strong reporting on topics affecting the local Chinese community, contends that the circulation numbers of more Beijing-friendly Chinese-language papers are inflated, giving them an unfair advantage when obtaining revenue through advertising. Unclear figures in media directories, a lack of transparency and of independent circulation audits by publications such as *Sing Tao*, *Ming Pao*, and *World Journal*, and distribution route data relayed by an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous lend credence to such suspicions.

*The Standard* were audited by Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations Limited as of 2012.

The case, later known as *Hongkong Standard case* or *Sally Aw case* (Chinese: 胡仙案) was criticised by the public by not suing Sally Aw, the chairwoman of Sing Tao Holdings. Chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, in the "*Report on the key issues during the second year of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China*" made a defence for decision of the Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung.

However, Tung Chee-chen, brother of Tung Chee-hwa, was an independent non-executive director of Sing Tao Holdings since December 1996, while Tung Chee-hwa also served the same position in the 1980s to the 1990s. It was reported that Tung Chee-hwa was a family friend of Sally Aw.


#### Takeover and dismantle

As of 1998, the company was still owned by Sally Aw, the daughter of the founder of *Sing Tao Daily* for 50.04%. It was reported that Aw agreed to sell 23% shares of the company, to Dublin-listed private equity fund China Enterprise Development Fund for a reported HK$115.8 million (HK$1.20 per share) in December 1998. However, Lazard Asia won the final bid to become the controlling shareholder for a reported HK$269 million (HK$1.25 per share). According to Charles Ho who bought Sing Tao Holdings in 2001 from Lazard, Cha Mou Sing [zh] also made an attempt to buy Sing Tao, but collapsed. However, Cha denied any formal agreement was signed. Ho's grandfather Ho Ying-chie, also filed a bankruptcy petition against Aw in January 1999. According to Ho Ying-chie, he had lent Aw HK$270 million. According to a reporter, Cha's listed company Mingly Corporation [zh] did announce a deal with Aw to form a new holding company for Sing Tao Holdings in May 1998, but the deal collapsed in June.

During Lazard as the major shareholder, Hong Kong banker Cheung Din Youn (Chinese: 張定遠, brother of Barry Cheung) was the chairman and Charles Ho was the honorary chairman and an independent non-executive director.³⁷

In mid-1999, Sing Tao SC stopped its operation as a football club. The legal entity of the company was used for other business in 2010 as Sing Tao Media Services, by its new owner Sing Tao News Corporation after many years of dormant.

In 2000, Sing Tao Holdings re-launched *The Standard* in tabloid format.
