## Career


### PaperG/Thunder

During his time at Harvard University, Bosmeny co-founded PaperG in 2007 with four other then-college students who, like him, were working at school newspapers: Victor Wong, Ka Mo Lau, and Victor Cheng from Yale University, as well as Roger Lee, who was working the *Harvard Crimson* with Bosmeny and graduated in 2008. PaperG was a startup company "enables websites to automate the creation of locally targeted advertising" and eventually served publications like The Los Angeles Times, The New York Post, and others.

According to Bosmeny, PaperG was developed out of a need to provide cheaper, alternative advertising to local businesses and organizations while "online ad was largely dominated by large national companies." In 2008, it won the Harvard i3 Innovation Challenge, earning Bosmeny and his team $5,000. By 2010, PaperG secured over a million dollars in funding. In 2011, PaperG opened headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area; an office in Seattle followed one year later. That year, in 2012, Bosmeny left to focus on his next venture.


### Clever

In 2012, Bosmeny co-founded the education technology company, Clever, with fellow Harvard University graduates Carroll and Garcia. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the company sought to streamline and centralize digital platforms for school systems, educators, and students in the United States while also helping smooth and simplify connections between schools and apps. That same year, Clever was on-boarded to Y Combinator.

Of the company's aims, Bosmeny stated in *TechCrunch*:

> You can an imagine if you're a teacher, each one of 20 students are using different apps to learn, and you need to track how students are progressing across all the apps they use. All this data, it should be making things easier, but instead, it's making it harder. [Clever] brings together all the usage data for all edtech products a teacher might be using in order to make it really easy for them to see all the usage that's happening and set weekly goals and accomplish different things.

Bosmeny served as the company's chief executive officer. Through the 2010s, Clever partnered with thousands of schools, millions of students, and earned approximately $60 million in funding alone while operating on a cash flow neutral basis starting in 2016. In 2014, Bosmeny along with Carroll and Garcia were named in *Forbes*' Education 30 Under 30. In 2017, Clever was ranked number four in *The Wall Street Journal*'s Tech Companies to Watch.

In 2021, Kahoot! acquired Clever at a valuation of "$435 million to $500 million"; Clever remained an independent company while integrating with Kahoot! apps and augmenting its reach beyond the United States and toward the over 200 countries Kahoot! had already been operating in. In 2022, Bosmeny stepped down from his role as chief executive officer; Trish Sparks assumed the role after him.


### Y Combinator

Bosmeny has been a Visiting Group Partner at Y Combinator since 2023.


## Personal life

In 2020, Bosmeny married Sophie Turnbull, a fellow Harvard University graduate from Australia. The "international couple" was spotlighted in the "Mini-Vows" section of *The New York Times* after their wedding ceremony in Hawaii that August.
