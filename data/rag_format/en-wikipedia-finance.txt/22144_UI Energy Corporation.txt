* US commander for the Middle East General John Abizaid (General John Abizaid served on the board of advisors from August – October 2007, resigning in November 2007 due to a conflict of interest. All fees were returned.)

These are claimed on the company's website to exercise "their network and political influence to promote UI energy on the development of oil fields in Iraq where the United States of America governs".

It also notes that attorney Jeffrey D. Jones, the former President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, and Dr. Robert A. Scalapino, who served as the Dean of the University of California, Berkeley, are on their company board of advisors.
