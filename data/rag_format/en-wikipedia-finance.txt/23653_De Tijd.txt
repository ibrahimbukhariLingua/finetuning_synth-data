***De Tijd*** (Dutch: [də ˈtɛit]; lit. 'The Times'*) is a Belgian newspaper that mainly focuses on business and economics. It is printed on salmon pink paper since May 2009, following the example of its colleagues* Financial Times*,* Het Financieele Dagblad*,* FT Deutschland *and many more.*


## History and profile

Established under the name of ***De Financieel-Economische Tijd*** (*"The Financial Economic Times"*) in 1968, in 2003 the paper was renamed as *De Tijd*.

*De Tijd* is owned by De Persgroep (50%) and Rossel (50%). The current editor-in-chief of *De Tijd* is Stephanie De Smedt [nl]. It is published in the Dutch language.

*De Tijd* is a typical financial daily, covering economy and business, financial markets and national and international politics. The paper is the main information source for Belgian managers (CIM-survey 2009). It is published from Tuesday to Saturday with no Sunday or Monday edition. The weekend edition is enriched with two magazines: Netto, on personal finance, and Sabato on lifestyle.

In March 2012 the paper began to be published in Berliner format.

*De Tijd* was named as the Newspaper of the Year in the category of nationwide newspaper by the European Newspapers Congress in 2012.


## Mediafin

*De Tijd* was established and financially supported by the Vlaams Economisch Verbond. In 2005, two major Belgian media conglomerates, the Flemish De Persgroep which is the owner of *Het Laatste Nieuws* and *De Morgen* among others and the Walloon Rossel which is the owner of *Le Soir* among others purchased Uitgeversbedrijf Tijd, the mother company of *De Tijd* and Editeco, the publishing company of *L'Echo*, the French counterpart. Both newspapers were integrated in the newly established Mediafin, in which De Persgroep and Rossel each hold a stake of 50 percent. Both newspapers stayed independent, but they work in the same building at the historical site of Tour & Taxis in Brussels since the merger. Frederik Delaplace [nl] was editorial director of Mediafin.
