# Design and Artists Copyright Society



The **Design and Artists Copyright Society** (DACS) is a British company limited by guarantee. It is a not-for-profit collective management organisation organisation established in 1983 and in operation since 1984.

It collects and distributes royalties to visual artists and their beneficiaries, and negotiates licensing agreements between them and third parties, including Tate, Penguin, Warner Music Group and Alexander McQueen. By 2024 DACS had distributed £200 million in royalties. DACS retains a percentage of royalties collected for operating costs, including advocating for visual artists’ rights through campaigning work and Parliamentary representation, plus sharing visual arts copyright information.


## History

In 1984 a group of artists and lawyers founded DACS to: support artists by managing their copyright, collect the royalties owed to artists for the use of their work.

Founding members included Elaine Kowalsky, Sir Eduardo Paolozzi, Susan Hiller and David Shepherd. Inspired by the French artists’ copyright society Société de la Propriété Artistique des Dessins et Modèles (SPADEM), they utilised their experience at ArtLaw and the Visual Artists’ Rights Society.

DACS was part of a successful campaign to introduce the Artist’s Resale Right in the UK.


## Operation and aim

DACS collect and distribute royalties to artists through their 3 main services: DACS ARR, DACS Payback and DACS Licensing. By 2024 DACS had distributed £200 million in royalties. In 2024, it paid £16.1 million in royalties to over 100,000 artists and estates, and arranged 1700 licences for its members.

It represents artists including David Hockney, Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, and its licensing customers include BBC, Christopher Kane, Phaidon, Netflix, Sky Arts, Shakespeare's Globe, Sony, Saatchi & Saatchi, Tate and UNIQLO.
