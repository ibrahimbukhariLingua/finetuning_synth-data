# Armenia–United States Strategic Partnership Charter



The **Armenia–United States Strategic Partnership Charter** is a treaty between Armenia and the United States aimed at strengthening bilateral relations through cooperation on various issues, including democracy, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and economic and military reforms. The full name of the charter is as "Charter on Strategic Partnership between the Republic of Armenia and the United States of America"

On 14 January 2025, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken signed a document in Washington, D.C. formalizing the strategic partnership. The agreement is based on shared values such as the promotion of democracy, support for sovereignty, and the inviolability of borders. While the partnership provides for U.S. assistance in Armenia's military and economic reforms, it does not include direct military intervention by the United States in the event of conflict.

The initiative to elevate relations between Armenia and the United States to a strategic partnership was first announced by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on 4 July 2024. Pashinyan expressed Armenia's readiness to strengthen ties with the United States at a strategic level.

## Analysis

Armenian analyst Benyamin Poghosyan, have compared the agreement to a similar one signed between the U.S. and Georgia in January 2009. However, Poghosyan noted that the Georgia–United States agreement does not include the same security guarantees provided by the U.S. to countries like Japan, South Korea, or the Philippines. Tigran Grigoryan, Director of the Regional Center for Democracy and Security in Yerevan, says the document strengthens bilateral relations and creates opportunities for closer cooperation in key areas.


### Foreign policy shift of Armenia

A shift in Armenia's foreign policy became evident in late 2022, when Russia and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) did not respond to Armenia's requests for military assistance following an Azerbaijani military incursion into Armenian territory. In the aftermath, Armenia began distancing itself from its allies, and in December 2024, Prime Minister Pashinyan declared that the changes in Armenia's relationship with the CSTO were "irreversible".


## Reactions

* Russia Russian press secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that "The United States has never played a particularly stabilizing role in the South Caucasus - one could even say the opposite. In the context of these 'opposite' actions, the U.S. is certainly trying in every possible way to pull more and more countries into its wake. But this is the absolutely sovereign right of our Armenian friends."

### International organizations

* Freedom House welcomed the signing of the charter, calling it "a testament to Armenia’s ongoing progress and dedication to democratic development."
