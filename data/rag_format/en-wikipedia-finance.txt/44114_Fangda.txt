# Fangda



**Fangda Partners** is a law firm headquartered in Shanghai, China with offices in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It is one of the 15 largest China-based law firms measured by number of lawyers. It is one of the most profitable law firms in China measured by either revenue or profit per partner and is generally believed to be the most difficult law firm to be hired at.

Fangda currently has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Shenzhen Guangzhou and Singapore.

Fangda is smaller than other large law firms and has a relatively narrower focus on high-value work for high-end financial institution clients and major multinationals. While Fangda is making efforts to break into other practice areas, the firm currently focuses on mergers and acquisitions, private equity, commercial litigation and arbitration, and bankruptcy as well as the capital market.


## History

Fangda Partners was founded in Shanghai in 1993 by six partners.

Fangda opened an office in Hong Kong in April 2012, following the recruitment of former Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer litigation partner Peter Yuen.

Fangda joined Ius Laboris, the international HR law firm network, in 2012.
