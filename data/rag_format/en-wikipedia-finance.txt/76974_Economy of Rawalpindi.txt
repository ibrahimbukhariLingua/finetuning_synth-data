## Overview

After the decline of the Mughal Empire in the South Asia, the Sikhs invaded, sacked and occupied Rawalpindi. The land, houses and businesses belonging to the local Muslims were occupied and settled by the invading Sikhs in 1765 and they also invited the Hindu traders to settle in the city. Slowly the economy recovered as the Muslim traders returned to the city and this was significant economic milestone in the Rawalpindi's history, and the city gradually became a regional trade hub owing to its location between Punjab and Kashmir.

During the British Raj, a military cantonment was established in the area. The army township aided in promoting commercial activity.
