**Culturecom Holdings Limited**, formerly **Jademan (Holdings) Limited**, is a Hong Kong company, headquartered in the Far East Finance Centre [zh; zh-yue] in Admiralty.


## History

Tony Wong Yuk-long (a.k.a. Tony Wong Chun-loong) created the company Jademan Holdings in 1971. In 1979 it became a formal corporation. The company was first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1986. At one time 80% of the comics market in Hong Kong came from this company. It acquired 70% of *Tin Tin Daily News* in April 1987, and acquired money from that company. According to Monica Ko of the *South China Morning Post*, because of Wong's profile in Jademan, the company's stock became known as "personality stock". Comics artist Ma Wing-shing worked for Jademan.

Beginning in the 1980s, Jademan began distributing comics in North America. The initial comic had a printing of 50,000. At first the circulation of its comics was 20,000 total, made up of four titles. Ultimately, the company had six titles in North America. By August 1990, the North American total circulation had declined to 10,000.

Tony Wong held control until 1989, when he was removed. After Wong resigned, his involvement in the company's comics ended. Tony Zie became the new chairperson. As of January 1990, the company had 65% of the Hong Kong comics market, and it had 16 titles in Chinese published in Hong Kong. In August 1990 the company had 14 comic book titles in Hong Kong, and the combined circulation there was 1.45 million, making up 60% of the comic book market. In Summer 1990, Ma Wing-shing started a new job at Jonesky.

In May 1992 the company changed its name to Cultural Communications as a way to push itself away from Tony Wong, who later was convicted of an offence and imprisoned. This became shortened to CultureCom. Leung Kin-cheung, the assistant general manager of the company, announced an intention to make new comic books with a different readership instead of competing with Tony Wong, who created another company, Jade Dynasty Publications.

Sing Tao Holdings acquired 39% of the shares of the company circa the late 1980s/early 1990s. Sing Tao made the decision to focus on translations of Japanese manga.

By 1998 Viagold Capital had proposed purchasing 32% of Culturecom for $21,000,000.

Circa August 1999, there was a proposal to give shares to Limeridge for $30,000,000, but an executive of a high level opposed the plan, and so in September 1999 it was nixed.

In 2000 the company had plans to develop a method of publishing electronic books in Chinese, referred to as the e-Cbook, with $200 million of investment money.

In 2004 there were plans to attract a "strategic partner", but when that failed, the company's stocks declined by 15.94%.
