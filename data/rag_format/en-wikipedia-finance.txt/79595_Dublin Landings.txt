The development includes 300 private rented sector apartments, 70,000 sq m of commercial space and 1,600 sq m of retail and leisure space.

The Central Bank of Ireland is located directly next to the Dublin Landings development.

In 2015, the Danish firm ARROW Architects emerged as the winners of the architectural competition, following which RKD was selected as the executive architects for the project.
