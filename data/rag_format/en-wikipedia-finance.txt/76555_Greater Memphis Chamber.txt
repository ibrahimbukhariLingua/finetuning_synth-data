## History

The chamber was founded in March 1838 by two businessmen, Col. Nathaniel Anderson and Louis Trezevant. The city of Memphis was new at the time and they formed the organization to function as a chamber of commerce.

In late 2022 the chamber was led by President & CEO Ted Townsend. He was promoted from his position at the chamber: director of economic development. Townsend succeeded Beverly Robertson who was in the position for four years and stepped down in 2022. Robertson succeeded Pinnacle Airlines CEO Philip Trenary who was shot dead in Memphis, Tennessee on September 27, 2018. Trenary served as the CEO of the Chamber until his death.

One of the chamber's biggest accomplishments was the Blue Oval City deal that they made with the Ford Motor Company. The US$5.6 billion Blue Oval City, was expected to employ 5,800 people from the Memphis area.
