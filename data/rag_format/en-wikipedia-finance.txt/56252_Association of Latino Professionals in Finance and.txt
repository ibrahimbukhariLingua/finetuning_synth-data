## History

ALPFA was the first national Latino professional association in the United States, founded in 1972 in Los Angeles, California. Gilberto Vasquez founded ALPFA, a certified public accountant recognized as a community leader and an entrepreneur. The organization was created to address the lack of opportunities and visibility for Latinos and Hispanics in their industry. When founded, the organization's original name was AHCPA (Association of Hispanic Certified Public Accountants) . In 2001, the name was changed to ALPFA (Association of Latino Professionals in Finance and Accounting) to be more inclusive of the professionals that were joining the organization. In November 2009, ALPFA merged with the National Hispanic Business Association (NHBA) to further grow the organization. In 2010, their name was officially changed to the Association of Latino Professionals For America to welcome professionals from all industries. In 2011, ALPFA launched ALPFA Solutions to provide advisory services. In 2016, ALPFA unveiled a new purpose: Connecting Latino Leaders for Impact. In 2017, ALPFA partnered with Fortune Magazine and Columbia University and hosted the first ever 50 Most Powerful Latina in Corporate America Event. In 2018, ALPFA Inc. appointed Damian Rivera as their CEO.
