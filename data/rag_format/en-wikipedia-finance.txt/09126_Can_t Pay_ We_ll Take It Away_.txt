Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away!


# Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away!



***Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away!*** is a British factual documentary series on Channel 5. It follows the work of High Court enforcement officers (previously known as sheriff's officers) as they execute privately obtained High Court writs across England and Wales on behalf of private clients, on those who have failed to make repayments on alleged debts or refuse to vacate a property. The series was first broadcast on 24 February 2014. In series 1 and 2 the show featured High Court enforcement agents (HCEAs) from a private limited company called High Court Solutions. The subsequent series featured HCEAs from Direct Collection Bailiffs Ltd (DCBL). Five series of the programme were broadcast from 2014 to 2018.


## Production

The series has been broadcast on Channel 5 since 24 February 2014. Their brief of the series says: "With exclusive access to some of the most experienced HCEAs and Repossession Teams in the country, this series is an eye-opening insight into cash-strapped Britain from the perspectives of debtors, creditors and debt collectors.

"Produced by Brinkworth Films, the series and its various spin-offs reveal what it means to be a creditor who cannot get back what they are owed, what it is like to be saddled with debt that you are simply unable to repay, and what it takes to be the kind of person who can pay but refuses to do so. Cameras capture the daily hassle of dealing with violent confrontations, tearful debtors, downright liars and genuine cases of hardship. Then there are the debtors, many of whom have some distressing tales to tell of how they got into the situation in the first place. No one wants their possessions confiscated, after all. The result is a unique insight into one of the biggest issues facing those who cannot afford to keep paying the bills."

## Complaints

Several episodes of the programme have been assessed by broadcasting regulator Ofcom after complaints. In 2015, Ofcom considered three complaints by individuals featured during the first series. In its decisions, the agency found that the complainants had not been subject to an unwarranted infringement of privacy despite being filmed both by body cameras and by regular cameras.

However, Ofcom reversed its 2017 decision after receiving supplemental information that the body cameras used by the enforcement agents came from the programme makers, not their employers (thus negating the argument that they were used for health and safety purposes). As the complainant in that case had not been informed that the footage would be broadcast, Ofcom found that there had been an unwarranted infringement of privacy. Ofcom has since found similar breaches in other episodes of *Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away!*, including in syndicated episodes from earlier series.

In February 2018, a couple whose eviction was shown during an episode of series 3 successfully sued Channel 5 for damages. The High Court of Appeals awarded the two £20,000 after finding that their privacy had been infringed. It was replaced by Channel 5 for a different type of show called, *Call The Bailiffs: Time To Pay Up*, which debuted on 19 July 2021.
