Trading with the Enemy Act


# Trading with the Enemy Act



**Trading with the Enemy Act** is a stock short title used for legislation in the United Kingdom and the United States relating to trading with the enemy.

*Trading with the Enemy Acts* is also a generic name for a class of legislation generally passed during or approaching a war that prohibit not just mercantile activities with foreign nationals, but also acts that might assist the enemy. While originally limited to wartime, in the 20th century these Acts were applied in cases of national emergency as well. For example, in 1940, before the United States entry into World War II the president imposed broad prohibitions on the transfer of property in which Norway or Denmark, or any citizen or national of those countries, or any other person aiding those countries, had any interest, with the exception of transfers which were licensed under the regulations of the Department of the Treasury.
