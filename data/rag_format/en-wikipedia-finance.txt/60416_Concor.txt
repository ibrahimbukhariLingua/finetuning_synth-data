Concor


# Concor



**Concor Holdings (Proprietary) Limited.** is a South African construction and mining services company. It is active throughout Southern Africa, involved in civil engineering, buildings, roads and mining projects. Concor returned as an independent brand in late 2016.


## Company history


### Origin

Engineer Fernando Piccinini, the original founder of Construction Corporation, registered the company in Johannesburg on 28 April 1948. The other four founding members were M. Barnabo, B. Chiozzi, U. Mantelli and V. Cini. The original name Construction Corporation was finally shortened to CONCOR. Eng. Piccinini was originally a chairman of Ferrocemento, an Italian construction giant and the emerging Concor received its technical support initially from there.


### Initial projects

The company's first major project was the construction of the Rand Sports Stadium in Johannesburg followed by contracts for the Pretoria and Johannesburg power stations. Another initial project was the Storms River bridge which was designed by Dr. Riccardo Morandi of Rome, this bridge was for many years the highest and longest single span bridge in South Africa.


### Structure

By the early 2000s, Concor consisted of the following divisions:

* Concor Buildings,
* Concor Civils,
* Concor Mining,
* Concor Engineering, 2010: Fabricated the tallest tank in southern hemisphere commissioned for Sasol Secunda at its Benzene Reduction Project, standing at 47.54m.
* Concor Technicrete,
* Concor Facility Management,
* Concor Property Development and
* Concor Roads.

Concor was listed on the JSE Securities Exchange and, for the year ended June 2005, Concor's last year as a listed company, had an annual turnover of 1.6 billion Rand.


### Relationship with Hochtief

By the early 2000s, the German international construction group Hochtief owned just under 50% of Concors shares providing the company with the benefits of technology transfer.


### Purchased by Murray & Roberts

Concor Holdings was delisted on 30 June 2006 when 100% of its share capital was purchased by Murray & Roberts. It changed its name when it merged with Murray and Roberts Construction (Pty) Ltd. Whilst under the control of Murray & Roberts, Concor Facility Management and Concor Property Development was closed whilst Concor Roads was merged with Concor Civils. Concor Technicrete was sold as a going concern.


### Purchased by consortium

The Concor and Murray and Roberts construction surface mining divisions were sold to a black owned consortium, consisting of the PIC and SPG in late 2016 and renamed Concor in May 2017. Concor is now certified a Level 1 BEE Company. The current CEO is Jerome Govender.
