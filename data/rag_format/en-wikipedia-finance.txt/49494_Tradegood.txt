## History

The new brand Tradegood was officially launched in August 2012 in the SOURCING at MAGIC at Las Vegas, USA, the largest apparel and textile expo in North America. It was then brought to the China market with a series of large scale launch events spanning across 6 major cities with the participation of some 1,000 buyers, suppliers, industry associations and media.
