EU Strategy for the Danube Region


# EU Strategy for the Danube Region



**EU Strategy for the Danube Region** — The European Union's macro-regional strategy for the Danube region, is a long-term policy of the European Union to address the problems of the Danube macro-region.

Adopted by the European Commission on 8 December 2011, in 2011 supported by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. Developed taking into account the experience of the Baltic Strategy (made possible by the positive results of the latter).


## Terms


### Tasks

According to the strategy, 14 countries of the Danube basin by 2020 should implement about 200 projects related to four main areas:

1. unification of the Danube region (transport, energy, culture, tourism);
2. environmental protection in the Danube region (restoration of water quality, control of environmental risks, preservation of landscape and biodiversity);
3. promoting prosperity (development of the “knowledge society” through research in education and information technology, maintaining the competitiveness of enterprises through the development of clusters and complexes, investing in the development of knowledge and skills of employees);
4. strengthening the position of the Danube region (including achieving political stability in the region, working together to ensure security, combating crime).

### Principles

1. *Lack of unnecessary bureaucratic institutions.* Projects within the framework of the Strategy are implemented with the involvement of existing European institutions by the relevant ministries of the Danube macro-region. Particular attention is paid to strengthening the effectiveness of bilateral interstate relations.
2. *No additional financial allocations*. Rational use of available appropriations and programs is welcome (around €100 billion by 2013).
3. *Lack of special European legislation*. The European Commission has minimized its own impact on the implementation of the Strategy, limiting itself to a purely coordinating function. The countries of the macro-region have taken responsibility for the implementation of the Danube Strategy, sharing the priority areas.
