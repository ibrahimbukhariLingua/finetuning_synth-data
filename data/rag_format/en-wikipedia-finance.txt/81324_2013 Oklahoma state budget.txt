## History

On February 6, 2012, Republican Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin proposed her $6.6 billion Executive Budget for Fiscal Year 2013. In accordance with the Oklahoma Constitution, the budget was balanced. Fallin's FY-2013 budget is flat compared to the 2012 Oklahoma state budget.

Fallin submitted her proposal to the heavily-Republican dominated Oklahoma Legislature. In early May 2012, after months of debate and review by House and Senate budget committees, the Senate and House convened the Joint Committee on Appropriations and Budget to address the FY13 budget. After months of review and debate, late in May 2012, Governor Fallin and the legislative leadership reached a $6.8 billion budget deal, an increase of $200 million over Fallin's original proposed budget. The increase is approximately 3.2% more than the FY-2012 budget.

The Republican dominated Senate passed the budget deal on May 22 by 30-15 vote, exactly along party lines. The Republican dominated House then addressed the budget on May 24. After an initial vote of 47-47 in which 17 House Republicans joined with all 30 House Democrats to vote against the bill. The House Democrats believed the bill did not provide adequate funding to education services while the several House Republicans believed the budget spent too money in total.

After a long recess the House reconvened and passed the budget 52-42, with 12 Republicans voting against the bill. 5 House Republicans who had originally voted against the budget switched their vote to ensure passage of the bill. Not a single Democrat in either the Senate or House voted in favor of the budget. Governor Fallin signed the 2013 budget bill on May 29, 2012.
