Saudi Fund for Development


# Saudi Fund for Development



**The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD)** (Arabic: الصندوق السعودي للتنمية) is a Saudi Arabian government agency that provides assistance to developing countries by financing social and infrastructure projects. The fund's development programme seeks to support the economies of recipient countries by enhancing economic growth and promoting job opportunities. It also administers loans and grants extended by the Saudi government to developing countries. The SFD was established in 1974 and began operations in 1975. Today, it is involved in as many as 3,750 projects in 71 different countries. The fund is led by Ahmed bin Aqeel Al-Khateeb, who also serves as the Minister of Tourism for Saudi Arabia.


## History

Since the SFD's establishment in 1975, it has financed infrastructure programmes (dams and transport) and invested in social projects such as healthcare facilities; Water, Sanitation and Health (WASH) programmes; and education. The SFD also invests in energy and agriculture sectors.


## Funding

As of July 2019,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the SFD’s capital is SAR 31 billion (USD 8.3 billion), from an initial investment of SAR 10 billion (USD 2.6 billion).
SFD has contributed official development assistance (ODA) to 1,000 projects in 85 countries through loan and grant mechanisms.
In 2017, SFD was responsible for 43.9% of ODA dispersed by Saudi government agencies.

SFD delivers funding bilaterally. However, it is also engaged in the multilateral development system and works with a wide range of organizations. Examples of these include: the United Nations, the World Bank, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, Islamic Development Bank, OPEC Fund for International Development, and the French Development Agency.

SFD’s funding is multi regional and provides development assistance to all developing countries, although it prioritizes the least developed and low-income countries. According to the World Bank, SFD is one of the most global of Arab international development funds, financing projects in many continents, including in Europe and South America.


### Official development assistance

In 2014, Saudi Arabia's gross ODA amounted to SAR 54 billion (USD 14.4 billion), which represented 1.90% of the country's Gross National Income (GNI). This exceeded the agreed international 0.70% ODA/GNI target.

In the same year, Saudi Arabia ranked higher in contributions than 28 other DAC member countries including the United Kingdom (0.70%), and the US (0.19%).

Saudi Arabia became a Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Participant of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2018 and began reporting its ODA contributions that same year. It is one of the largest providers in terms of volume, with increasing levels of ODA.

As of 2020, Saudi Arabia has been ranked fifth globally and first in the Arab world for its provision of humanitarian aid. According to the UN Financial Tracking Service platform, Saudi Arabia contributed SAR 4.8 billion (US $1.2 billion) or 5.5% of the total amount of international spending on relief programs.


## Multi-country programs

SFD’s methodology has been to assess the needs of nations - whether those be in energy, water, transportation or other principal development areas - and work to finance projects that address a particular need, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SFD, as a member of the Arab Coordination Group, contributed funding to help developing countries economically recover from the recession caused by the pandemic. Collectively, the Arab Coordination Group has committed SAR 375 billion (US $10 billion) to this specific effort.


## Reducing isolation in landlocked countries

SFD has supported transportation and infrastructure projects designed to reduce social and economic isolation in landlocked countries in Africa . The absence of infrastructure and connectivity among these countries has resulted in a decrease in exports, given that transport costs account for approximately 77% of export value. This has had a significant impact on landlocked countries’ abilities to trade with their neighbors.

To combat this, SFD has contributed to the financing of several internal and external road projects in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali and Chad, linking them to seaports in Djibouti, Ghana and Mauritania. Due to their geographical location, the countries have experienced significant social and economic challenges; the development of the roads and transportation links is expected to enhance trade and connectivity in the region, with the potential to generate jobs and increase business opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).


## Saudi program for wells and rural development in Africa

SFD established this program to mitigate the effects of drought in rural regions in several African countries. Under the program, over 6,000 water facilities have been equipped, and 2.5 million people have secured improved access to water.


## Partnerships and multi-lateral official development assistance

SFD partners with international organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations, sending support into its branches including the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It has also built partnerships with the development funds in other states to aid multilateral approaches, working on relationships with organizations such as the Agence française de développement (AFD), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and, before its dissolution, the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID).

SFD also collaborates with regional development partners such as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA), the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (FKDEA), the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), the ECOWAS Investment and Development Bank (EBID) and the West African Development Bank (BOAD) .


### United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

Saudi Arabia, via SFD, is a leading donor to UNHCR globally. SFD has provided more than SAR 200 million (US $54 million) to 11 UNHCR projects. According to the UNHCR, Saudi contributions have enabled a continued humanitarian response in the Middle East and other regions, particularly to those affected by the Yemen, Syria, Afghanistan, and Rohingya crisis.

SFD has supported the UNHCR’s humanitarian efforts in refugee camps, such as the Al-Azraq Camp in Jordan. SFD has provided SAR 34.5 million (US $9.2 million) to two projects to support the construction of an electrical network system in the camp. Implemented in two phases, the electrical network will connect all shelters, plot lighting, markets, and various public spaces in the Al-Azraq camp to the electrical grid, improving access to electricity for more than 25,000 Syrian refugees living in the camp.


### United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine refugees in the near east

SFD has a long-standing legacy of supporting Palestinians and the Palestinian cause through UNRWA projects. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, through SFD, was recognized as one of the top three largest donors to UNRWA and has donated SAR 3 billion (US $800 million) to the agency since 1994.

To date, SFD has contributed to 34 UNRWA programmes and projects in support of Palestinians, such as large-scale maintenance projects that will ensure that 268 schools and health centers in Syria, Jordan, Gaza, Lebanon, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem are structurally sound.
These projects include support to maintain Palestinian refugee camps in different countries in the Middle East such as the UNRWA Al-Safsaf School in Dera’a refugee camp in Syria, which was inaugurated in 2020.
SFD’s funding has also contributed to the renovation of schools in the West Bank, where 46,000 Palestinian refugee children were educated in the 2019-2020 academic year at 96 schools run by the UNRWA.


### United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

SFD has partnered with the UNDP on several projects in the Gaza Strip to provide housing that benefits approximately 13,466 families from the region. In February 2020, SFD signed an additional SAR 37.5 million (US $10 million) agreement with UNDP and UNRWA to fund the repair and reconstruction of houses in the Gaza Strip. This fourth amendment brings the total SFD contribution to SAR 306 million (US $81.5 million).

SFD has also provided SAR 43.7 million (US $11.6 million) to the UNDP to develop the infrastructure of the Swat district in Pakistan. As a result, more than 800,000 people in the Swat district of Khyber Pankhurst province will have the restoration of 639 ongoing basic community infrastructure schemes.


### United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF)

UNICEF has recognized Saudi Arabia for its support for UNICEF, stating it had contributed significantly to development projects that benefit millions of children around the world. SFD has supported UNICEF with SAR 86 million (US $23 million) for education, health, nutrition, and water and sanitation services in Pakistan. This has culminated in the development of schools in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan.
