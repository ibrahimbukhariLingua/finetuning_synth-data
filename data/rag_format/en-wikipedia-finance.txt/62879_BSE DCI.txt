BSE DCI


# BSE DCI



The **Botswana Stock Exchange Domestic Company Index** or **BSE DCI**, and the **Botswana Stock Exchange Foreign Company Index** or **BSE FCI** are the principal stock indices of the Botswana Stock Exchange. Each is calculated from the weighted averages of the values of their category of stock. A third index value, the All Company Index, is derived from a weighted average of the two indices. On the Botswana Stock Exchange, a company that is designated as a "foreign company" is a company that is "dual-listed", meaning that it is also listed on another stock exchange.
