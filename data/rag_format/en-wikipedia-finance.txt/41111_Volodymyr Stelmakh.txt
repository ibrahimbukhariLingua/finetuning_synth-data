## Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine

From January 2000 to January 2003, Stelmakh served his first turn as Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU). According to Stelmakh, one of the main initiators of his resignation was Prime Minister Anatoliy Kinakh, who wanted to cover the lack of revenue in the 2002 state budget by printing more money. As head of the NBU, he stated he was categorically against such a step, as it would lead to a rise in inflation.

On 16 December 2004, Stelmakh was reppointed the Governor of the NBU.

During the 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Stelmakh was placed number 28 on the electoral list of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc. However, Stelmakh refused the deputy mandate in favor of his post at the NBU.
