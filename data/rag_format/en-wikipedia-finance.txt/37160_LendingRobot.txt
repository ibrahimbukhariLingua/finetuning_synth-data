# LendingRobot



**LendingRobot** is an automated investment service for Peer-to-peer lending for retail investors. It is based in Seattle, Washington, and was the first SEC-registered Investment Advisor in the Peer to Peer Lending industry.


## History

LendingRobot was originally created as a small script by Emmanuel Marot and Gilad Golan to automate their own, personal investments on Lending Club. After discovering that the most popular loans were gone a few seconds only after publication, they decided to offer the service to other individual investors. The first tests with external users were made in September 2013. In the following months, LendingRobot accepted more users while still remaining in private beta.

In April 2014 LendingRobot exited beta and has become the first company to offer automated secondary market note trading on FOLIOfn, a note trading platform for Lending Club.

LendingRobot added support for the Prosper Marketplace in February 2014ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, and became registered as Investment Advisor with the SEC in April 2014.
