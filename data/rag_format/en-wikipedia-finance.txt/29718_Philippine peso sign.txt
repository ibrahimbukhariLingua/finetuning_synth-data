Philippine peso sign


# Philippine peso sign



The **Philippine peso sign** (₱) is the currency symbol used for the Philippine peso, the official currency of the Philippines. The symbol resembles a Latin letter P with two horizontal strokes. It differs from the currency symbol used for the peso in Latin America, which is "$".


## History

The Philippine peso sign was introduced by *Executive Order No. 66* of the United States colonial government on 3 August 1903. The sign, in capitalized Roman letter P with two parallel lines "passing through and extending slightly beyond loop at right angle to shaft or stem", was decreed to be used "by all officials as the designation of the new Philippine peso to differentiate it from the $ sign for US dollars and Spanish pesetas..." This sign was chosen by Charles Edward Magoon, acting chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, and was approved by Governor William H. Taft.


## Encoding

The peso is usually denoted by the symbol "₱". This symbol was added to the Unicode standard in version 3.2 and is assigned U+20B1 ₱ PESO SIGN (₱). The symbol can be accessed through some word processors by typing in `20b1` and then pressing the `Alt`+`X` buttons simultaneously, or by pressing and holding `Alt`, then pressing `8369` on the keypad. Other ways of writing the Philippine Peso sign are "PHP", "PhP", "P", or "P" (strike-through or double-strike-through uppercase P), which is still the most common method, although font support for the Unicode Peso sign has been around for some time.

The international three-letter currency code for the Philippine peso is **PHP**.
