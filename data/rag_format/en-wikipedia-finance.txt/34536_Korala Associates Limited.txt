KAL supplies its software to major global banks including China Construction Bank, Citibank and UniCredit.


## History

The company was established in 1989 by Dr. Aravinda Korala; hence Korala Associates Limited. KAL is headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland. KAL also has office locations elsewhere in the UK, plus in the US, Europe, India, China, Japan, Malaysia and Australia. In 2011 KAL won the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category.


## Products

KAL's major product is self-service software for ATMs and kiosks. In 2012, KAL introduced the RTM (Retail Teller Machine). The RTM dispenses vouchers instead of cash meaning banks can operate in previously inaccessible areas while still offering the complete feature set of an ATM. KAL was the first ATM software company to deliver its products certified for Microsoft Windows 8 – just one week after the new operating system was officially launched by Microsoft in November 2012.

* Product suite conformed to the WOSA 1.11 industry standard in 1995 (later renamed to XFS in 2000)
