# 2GO Group



**2GO Group Inc.**, also known simply as **2GO** is a Philippines-based transportation and logistics company operating a fleet of inter-island passenger ferries and cargo ships. The top two principal shareholders of the 2GO Group are SM Investments Corp, and Trident Investments.


## Company history

The first precursor company to 2GO Group Inc. began on May 26, 1949 under the corporate name **William Lines, Inc**. William Lines later merged with Gothong Lines and Universal Aboitiz Inc to form the **William, Gothong and Aboitiz Inc. (WG&A)**. Eventually, the **Aboitiz Transport System** was formed by, first, the breakup of WG&A into SuperFerry and Carlos A. Gothong Lines and then the merging of SuperFerry with Cebu Ferries and SuperCat fast ferries to form the Aboitiz Transport System.

On October 15, 2004, the freight businesses, (which includes freight, express, logistics and solutions) of Aboitiz Transport System were rebranded as **2GO**.

On December 1, 2010, Its former parent company, Aboitiz Equity Ventures and Aboitiz and Company Inc. sold the company and its brands to Negros Navigation Co. Inc. (NENACO), for US$105 million. The equity value included all the logistics and shipping businesses of the company, except its interest in its joint ventures with the Jebsen Group of Norway.

At the same time, December 2010, Negros Navigation announced that the China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund acquired a controlling stake in the company through an equity infusion. The China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund is a Netherlands-based, private equity firm wholly owned and controlled by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Because Negros Navigation was a privately held firm the exact amount invested by the Fund was not disclosed.

Later, in 2012 the company was reorganized and rebranded as 2GO Group Inc. with its brands SuperFerry, SuperCat, and Cebu Ferries merged with Negros Navigation to form **2GO Travel**.

In 2016, SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) and Dennis Uy's Chelsea Logistics inc jointly acquired a major stake of 2GO Group Inc, owning a significant share in the company. Later, 2GO Group Inc and Negros Navigation Co. merged.

In 2021, Dennis Uyâ€™s Chelsea Logistics and Infrastructure Holdings Corporation sold its entire stake in 2GO Group to SM Investments Corporation (SMIC) making 2GO a subsidiary of SM Investments Corporation (SMIC). Later, 2GO Group started its modernization program.

In 2023, it voluntarily delisted from the Philippine Stock Exchange after successfully conducting a tender offer.
