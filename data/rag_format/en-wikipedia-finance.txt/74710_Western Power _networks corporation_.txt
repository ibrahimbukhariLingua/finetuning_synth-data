# Western Power (networks corporation)



**Western Power** is a statutory corporation established by the Electricity Corporations Act 2005 (WA). It is owned by the State Government of Western Australia and is accountable to the Minister for Energy. It is responsible for building, maintaining and operating the electricity network within the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the poles and wires or energy grid.

When the original Western Power Corporation was split it was separated into four independent companies:

* Western Power - manages the physical network that transports electricity. It operates in the south west of WA, including the Perth metropolitan area. Western Power does not generate electricity or send electricity bills to customers. Its role is to manage the poles, wires, substations and other infrastructure that brings electricity to homes and businesses in the SWIS.
* Horizon Power - manages the physical network that transports electricity in the north and regional areas of WA. Horizon power is also responsible for electricity generation and billing.
* Synergy - the energy retailer that manages electricity accounts and is responsible for billing customers.
* Verve Energy - the generation business that produces electricity. Merged with Synergy in 2014.
