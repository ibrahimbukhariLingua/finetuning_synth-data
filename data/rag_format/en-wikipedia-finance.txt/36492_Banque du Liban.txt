Banque du Liban


# Banque du Liban



***Banque du Liban*** (Arabic: مصرف لبنان; English: Bank of Lebanon) is the central bank of Lebanon. It was established on August 1, 1963, and became fully operational on April 1, 1964.
In 2023, Wassim Mansouri stepped up as interim governor of the Banque du Liban after Lebanon failed to name a successor to Riad Salameh, whose term finished in July 2023. Salameh, who was chairman for 30 years, has been accused of corruption, money laundering and running the largest Ponzi scheme in history; he was additionally labeled "the world’s worst central banker". He is currently under sanctions by Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

One of the main responsibilities of the bank is issuing Lebanon's currency, the Lebanese Pound. Other responsibilities include maintaining monetary stability, regulation of money transfers, and maintaining the soundness of the banking sector. Banking is a very important part of Lebanon's economy with over 100 different banks, which makes the role of BdL particularly important. It currently owns 99.37% of the shares of Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines. The BdL is also the dominant shareholder of the Intra Investment Company (IIC), which in turn owns 53% of Casino du Liban, making it the only central bank worldwide to rule over a Las Vegas–style gambling casino.

Besides the main branch in Beirut, it has branches in Aley, Baalbeck, Bikfaya, Jounieh, Nabatiye, Sidon, Tripoli, Tyre, and Zahlé.

Ottoman domination of Lebanon, which lasted for more than four centuries, was brought to an end on October 6, 1918, with the entry of the Levant Marine Division into Beirut. The paper money issued by the Turkish Treasury, with a forced exchange rate, suffered the same fate.

In order to normalize economic life in the occupied territories and cover the expenses of the allied forces, British authorities imposed the banknotes of the National Bank of Egypt, the Egyptian currency having been, since October 30, 1916, closely linked to sterling and entirely covered by securities issued in sterling.

In accordance with the convention signed between the French and the British governments on September 15, 1919, a new occupying authority started to rule Lebanon. French troops replaced the British, under the command of General Gouraud, who was appointed on October 12, 1919, as "High-Commissioner of the French Republic in Syria and Cilicia, and Commander-in-Chief of the Levant Army". Consequently, the use of the Egyptian currency, suitable for the British Treasury, became inappropriate. To obtain Egyptian pounds, France, being the sole occupying power, had to offer increasing amounts of francs.

During World War I, the French franc had maintained its status thanks to advances from the British and American treasuries. However, in 1919, the French franc registered a drop because of the British government's decision to stop these advances, thus breaking the alliance between the franc, sterling and the dollar, and also because of the United States Government's decision to suspend its regulating role of the associated change rates. In order to replace the Egyptian pound, the French government decided, by Decree N° 129 issued by the High Commissioner on March 13, 1920, to endow Syria with a national currency.

On September 1, 1920, the representative of France proclaimed Great Lebanon. In 1920, the Banque de Syrie et Liban ("Bank of Syria and of Lebanon"), which had been created for that purpose by the French-controlled Ottoman Bank, was granted the concession of issuing the Syrian–Lebanese currency, which became legal tender on May 1, 1920. Banknotes issued by this bank were reimbursable to the bearer or at sight by checks drawn on Paris, at the rate of FF 20 for £S 1 .

As a consequence, an independent, currency-issuing department was established at the Banque de Syrie et Liban. It was responsible for putting in circulation and withdrawing banknotes. Issuances were made either on behalf of the Treasury in Paris or on behalf of the Bank itself.

Concerning commercial operations, the Issuing Department was to provide the Banque de Syrie with banknotes only in exchange of foreign currencies or foreign securities, which constituted, together with the credits granted by the Treasury in Paris, the coverage of the currency in circulation. The Banque de Syrie et du Liban's Issuing Department would later form the basis for the establishment of the Banque du Liban.


## Role and function

The Banque du Liban was established by the Code of Money and Credit promulgated on 1 August 1963, by decree no. 13513. It started to operate effectively on 1 April 1964.

Its capital is totally appropriated by the State.


## Governing body

The Banque du Liban is managed by the Governor, who is assisted by four vice governors as well as by the Central Council. By convention, the Governor of the Banque du Liban is always a Maronite Christian.

Upon the proposal of the Minister of Finance, the Governor is appointed by decree sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, for a renewable six-year term. After the consultation with the governor and upon the proposal of the Minister of Finance, the vice governors are appointed by decree sanctioned by the Council of Ministers for a renewable five-year term.

### The Special Investigation Commission

The Special Investigation Commission (SIC) is a multi-function financial intelligence unit (FIU) with judicial status. It is the centerpiece of Lebanon's anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) regime, a platform for international cooperation and plays a vital role in safeguarding concerned sectors from illicit proceeds. The SIC's tasks include receiving and analyzing suspicious transaction reports (STRs), conducting financial investigations, lifting banking secrecy, freezing accounts and/or transactions and forwarding them to concerned judicial authorities. With respect to terrorism and the financing of terrorism, the SIC is also empowered to prevent the use of movable or immovable assets.

## Investment policy for startups

Aug. 22, 2013, Central Bank of Lebanon issued the new investment policy called "Circular No. 331". This aim to support Lebanon's knowledge economy by providing support to the thriving startup ecosystem. With this audacious move, Lebanon's Central Bank hopes to increase the country's GDP, decrease unemployment and position Lebanon as the tech hub of the Middle East.

The outcomes of the circular have however fallen short of the expectations. Many Lebanon's observers pointed that the initiative lacked transparency: There has been no clear indication of the number of start-up funded, jobs created and money spent. The initiative was unable to overcome a major hurdle of the Lebanese economy: banks' extremely risk-averse and conservative attitude towards investment.

Circular No. 331 encourages commercial banks to invest in start-ups. The BDL will guarantee up to 75% of the value of these commercial bank investments in the capital of start-ups that meet the determined criteria. Here are some of the start-ups that are innovative Lebanese companies working in the knowledge economy sector and have contributed to creating jobs.

* MEVP - is a Middle East-focused venture capital firm that invests in the early and growth stages of innovative companies run by talented entrepreneurs Walid Hanna and Walid Mansour primarily, but not exclusively, in the Middle East Region with a focus on the GCC and Levant markets.
* Berytech - a Lebanese tech focused business development center, has recently announced a $50 million investment fund, the Berytech Fund II. Berytech incubator is led by chairman Maroun Chammas.
* Leap Ventures - is a growth stage Venture Capital firm in the Middle East and North Africa, based out of Beirut and Dubai. Leap Ventures looks to make investments in innovation & technology startups from the MENA region that have reached the series B stage: startups that have established a market presence and are seeking to dramatically accelerate their global market penetration and commercialization. Leap Ventures is led by founding partners Henri Asselly and Hala Fadel.

* My ME - is a socially-responsible, personal travel planning service that helps guests design and implement trips to the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean based on their own travel dates, travel preferences, and personal style. My Middle East - prepares personalized travel plans to Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and Croatia (and soon other destinations).
* Kashida - is the first registered company in the world to transform the Arabic letterform into evocative, functional 3D design pieces. They offer contemporary home décor accents, furniture, corporate gifts and event souvenirs to create a more personalized living/work space for our B2B and B2C clients.
* Egnyt Technology incubator managed by Samir Chreim. Egnyt recently opened 2,500-sqft business incubator in Beirut that is meant for enterprises focusing on technology.

According to the circular, the total participation of any bank in start-ups may not exceed 3% of the bank's capital, provided the participation of any bank in a single start-up does not exceed 10% of the aforementioned 3%. Thus, commercial banks must invest in at least 10 start-ups if they want to benefit from all the facilities provided to them by BDL.

The startup accelerator UK Lebanon Tech Hub is a startup initiative between Banque du Liban and the UK government.


## Allegations of misconduct

In November 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that the United States and other Western countries demanded a forensic audit of the Banque du Liban (BDL), as it was accused of money laundering, corruption and links to Hezbollah.

In 2023, it was reported that the forensic audit—which had been a key demand of the international community and the International Monetary Fund—revealed years of misconduct by the bank's former governor Riad Salameh and $111 million in "illegitimate commissions". The audit covered the 2015–2020 period.

Among other things, the audit report details BDL's practice of financial engineering, which, starting in 2015, it used to allow local banks to attract dollar deposits from abroad and then have the lenders deposit the dollars at BDL. The local lenders were given interest rates higher than international market rates in return. According to the audit, the central bank disguised losses equal to $76 billion through the engineering. Salameh said the bank's central council had found financial engineering to be the "best response to a deteriorating balance of payment" and that he had not "intervened" in decision-making on engineering. BDL has said the operations are legal.

On August 10, 2023, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada imposed sanctions on Salameh and a handful of his close relatives and associates due to corruption allegations. Meanwhile, France, Germany, and Luxembourg were investigating Salameh and several close associates over alleged financial crimes, including illicit enrichment and money laundering of $330 million. France and Germany issued Interpol notices for Salameh in May 2023; however, Lebanon does not hand over its citizens to foreign countries.
