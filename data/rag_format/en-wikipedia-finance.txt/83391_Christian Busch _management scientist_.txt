## Research

Busch’s research interests include:

* Serendipity
* Leadership and strategy-making under uncertainty
* Social entrepreneurship and social innovation
* High-growth entrepreneurship and innovation
* Emerging markets

He has received multiple ‘Best Paper Awards’ from the Academy of Management, as well as the Masini Award for Innovative Scholarship. He serves on the Editorial Review Board of the Academy of Management Perspectives and is a guest editor at the Strategic Management Journal for a special issue on ‘Serendipity, Chance, and Luck in Management and Strategy’.

Busch has published several scientific papers on serendipity, conceptualizing it as “active luck”—the notion of actively making surprising and valuable discoveries. He identifies three key elements of serendipity that help distinguish it from related concepts: agency, surprise and value, and presents a multi-level model involving chance triggers, associations (creating new connections) and ‘materialization’ (realizing a specific possibility). Busch’s theory suggests that social actors have agency in creating serendipity: Like training ‘hard skills’ related to finance or engineering, it is possible to train serendipity-related skills such as alertness.

Busch’s research is widely used in educational and professional development programs, including by the American Psychological Association and Harvard Business Review's Harvard ManageMentor.

He has delivered multiple TEDx Talks on topics such as serendipity, innovation, and purpose-driven leadership.
