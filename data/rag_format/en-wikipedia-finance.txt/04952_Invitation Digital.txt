# Invitation Digital



**Invitation Digital Ltd** is a mobile marketing company based in Bristol, UK, best known for running the website vouchercloud.

Vodafone Ventures (VfV) bought a minority shareholding in Invitation Digital Ltd in May 2011 and used seed funding to help build the platform, before Vodafone Group PLC became majority shareholders in June 2012.


## History

Invitation Digital Ltd was set up in 2008 to deliver digital incentive promotions and loyalty schemes across Europe. Group sister company Invitation Media had previously published the Invitation Book, which provided printable vouchers across 14 UK cities from 2003. In February 2010 the company launched vouchercloud, turning its printable voucher book into a digital service. The launch of the website coincided with the release of the app on Apple iPhone, and was later rolled out onto Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone devices. Following Vodafone investment, vouchercloud expanded internationally in 2012, launching in Ireland in June, Malta in July and the Netherlands in November. The app and website launched in Germany in March 2013 and vouchercloud is set to expand into other countries across the globe.
