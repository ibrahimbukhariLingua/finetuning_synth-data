International Council of Shopping Centers


# International Council of Shopping Centers



The **International Council of Shopping Centers**, doing business as **ICSC**, is the global trade association of what it calls the "Marketplaces Industry" (i.e., shopping centers, shopping malls, and all other retail real estate).


## History

Founded in 1957, it features more than 70,000 members in over 100 countries, including shopping center owners, developers, managers, marketing specialists, investors, retailers and brokers, as well as academics and public officials. As the global industry trade association, ICSC links with more than 25 national and regional shopping center councils throughout the world.

In July 2021, ICSC rebranded itself in terms of its initials alone, and adopted the tagline "Innovating Commerce Serving Communities".

In September 2015, ICSC announced that Tom McGee, former vice chairman at Deloitte LLP, the worldâ€™s largest professional services organization, would serve as its new president and CEO. McGee was only the fourth person to head ICSC in its 65-year history. He succeeded retired President and CEO Michael P. Kercheval.

The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) hosts events throughout the year, for professionals in the retail real estate industry. These events range from large-scale conferences like ICSC Las Vegas and ICSC New York.
