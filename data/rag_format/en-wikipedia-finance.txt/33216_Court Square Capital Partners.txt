## History

March 2015 Court Square Capital acquired Research Now.

Court Square currently manages approximately $8.2 billion of investor commitments.

The firm's predecessor Citicorp Venture Capital Equity Partners traces its roots to 1968 with the founding of Citicorp Venture Capital. In the 1980s, CVC Equity Partners began to focus primarily on leveraged buyout transactions.

The spin out of Court Square came at the same time as the spin outs of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: JPMorgan Chase (CCMP Capital), Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).

In 2008, Citigroup sold off the bulk of its $400 million of interests in legacy Court Square investment funds to secondary investors AlpInvest Partners and Goldman Sachs.
