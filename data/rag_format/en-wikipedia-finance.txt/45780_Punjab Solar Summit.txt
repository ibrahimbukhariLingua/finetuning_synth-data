Punjab Solar Summit


# Punjab Solar Summit



**Punjab Solar Summit** was a Government of Punjab hosted event in Chandigarh on July 23, 2015 to bring prospective entrepreneurs, investors and other stake holders on a common platform.


## Making farmers' entrepreneurs

The New and Renewable Energy Minister, Bikram Singh Majithia, elected in Punjab had announced when he took over as Minister for New and Renewable Energy (Punjab) that he has a dream to make Punjab a solar state and the state is now in sniffing distance from realising its dream.

## Green Power Revolution

The Green Revolution changed the face of agriculture and now it is the turn of Green Power Revolution to catapult power scenario because solar power is both clean power and green power. One unit of thermal or coal power emits about 825 grams of carbon dioxide. However, in case of solar power, no carbon dioxide is emitted. The Punjab Solar Summit 2015 is the foremost step towards the Green Power Revolution.
