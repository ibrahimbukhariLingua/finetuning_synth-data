# Alabama International Trade Center



The **Alabama International Trade Center** was created in 1979 as one of the first *international Small Busicness Development Centers (SBDCs)*. Since its inception, the AITC has provided export trade research, education, finance, and training throughout Alabama.


## History & Personnel

Dr. William R. Bennett, Emeritus Professor of Marketing and International Business at the University of Alabama, founded the Trade Center in 1979. AITC was one of the first university-based small business development centers in the country that focused specifically on international trade. Following Dr. Bennett's retirement in 1983, Ms. Nisa Miranda, who had helped Bennett establish the Center while completing her MBA, was promoted to Director. Miranda would oversee the Center's growth and development for the next 21 years, helping the Center become designated as SBA's State Model of Excellence in International Trade. (Miranda has since moved on to become Director of the University of Alabama's Center for Economic Development.

In 2004, Mr. Brian Davis, who had served as the Trade Center's Associate Director since 1985, took over as Director. Davis is the former president of the Alabama World Trade Association (AWTA) and NASBITE International. In addition to serving on the University's Advisory Board for International Business, Davis is also active in the Alabama-India Business Partnership.

AITC currently employs several consultants:

* Michael J. Brooks, Assistant Director - Research & Training
* Carolyn Turner, International Trade Specialist
* Elaine Phillips, International Trade Specialist
* Deborah van der Toorn, Export Trade Consultant
* Erin Coleman, Project Accountant
* Karla Jordan, Administrative Assistant

In addition to the professional staff, AITC employs up to 20 Research Fellows as part of its research staff. The Research Fellows are hired on a competitive basis, and consist of graduate and undergraduate students with expertise in market research, business strategy, foreign relations, political science, and foreign languages. Mr. Brooks was in charge of hiring and training the research staff between 1998 and 2010. He also teaches an import-export class at the Culverhouse College of Business. Mrs. Turner now manages the research staff, and coordinates workshops and webinars throughout the state.

The Trade Center is part of the Alabama Small Business Development Center Network, a statewide network of 10 management and technical assistance centers.
