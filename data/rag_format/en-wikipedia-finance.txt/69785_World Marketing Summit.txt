## History

World Marketing Summit was founded in 2011 by Philip Kotler, an American marketing professor, author and consultant; currently the S. C. Johnson Distinguished Professor of International Marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Kotler attended a seminar in Abu Dhabi in which he first shared the idea of forming a forum of marketers who can contribute towards alleviating poverty. Later, this idea was shared with other associates in Canada and Bangladesh and finally evolved into a tangible concept. The concept gave birth to World Marketing Summit in 2012 in Dhaka, Bangladesh under the patronage of the Government of Bangladesh in collaboration with Bangladesh Brand Forum.
