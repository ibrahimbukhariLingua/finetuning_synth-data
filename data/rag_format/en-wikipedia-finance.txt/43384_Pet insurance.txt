## Policies

Pet insurance is a form of property insurance rather than health insurance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Insurance companies may limit coverage for pre-existing conditions, giving owners an incentive to insure even very young animals, which are not expected to incur high veterinary costs. Some British policies for dogs also include third-party liability insurance. For example, if a dog causes a car accident that damages a vehicle, the insurer will pay to rectify the damage for which the owner is responsible under the Animals Act 1971.
