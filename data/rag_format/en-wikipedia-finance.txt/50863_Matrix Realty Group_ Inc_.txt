## Ownership and history

The Matrix Realty Group was founded in 1993 by Richard Nieto, and after 4 years, the late Glen Nelson joined as managing partner. Nieto is responsible for managing all aspects of the Matrix Realty Group. Since 1993, he has overseen the acquisition, financing, leasing, property management, redevelopment, and sale of over 10 million square feet of real estate throughout the United States. Richard Nieto's focus was on the purchase of defaulted notes.

According to the New York Real Estate Journal, the real estate company started with ″absolutely no money and organically grew without the help of investors or partners. ″*Matrix has grown due to the sincere and genuine way of doing business the old school way – with a handshake*.″ (New York Real Estate Journal October 27, 2015 "Executive of The Month")

One of Matrix's most recent projects includes a $40M housing, office project planned for Grant Deneau Tower in downtown Dayton.

On December 20, 2015, two days before his 49th birthday, Nelson died when he lost control of his car while driving along East Broadway in Port Jefferson, New York. He was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.
