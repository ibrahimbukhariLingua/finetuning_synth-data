After completing his apprenticeship, Erichsen was employed in the Blach trading house. He became part of the management of the company after C. S. Blach's death in 1781.

His ships brought spices and precious textiles home from the East Indies and transported grain from the Baltic countries to England. His fleet consisted of 13 ships in 1797.

Erichsen's shipping enterprise encountered adversities after circa 1800. Several of his ships were captured by privateers. Erichsen responded /by increasingly engaging in banking. He provided the Danish government with huge loans in 1808–1812 and again in 1819 and the 1820s.

Erichsen's brother Peter Erichsen was a partner in the company for many years. His sons joined it in 1816. It went bankrupt in 1833.

He was a member of the Council of 32 Men in 1788–1806 and was president of Grosserer-Societetet from its foundation in 1817.

He was appointed to royal agent in 1782, council of state (*etatsråd*) in 1812 and *konferensråd* in 1831.


## Property

Erichsen constructed the Erichsen Mansion at Holmens Kanal in 1799–1801. He also constructed the country house Hellerupgård to design by Joseph-Jacques Ramée.
