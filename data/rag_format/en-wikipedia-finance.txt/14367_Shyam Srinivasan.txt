His immediate priority upon taking the helm was to modernize the bank’s infrastructure and expand its reach, both geographically and digitally. This marked the beginning of an ambitious transformation aimed at positioning Federal Bank as a national player with a strong technological backbone.

Under Shyam Srinivasan's leadership, Federal Bank significantly enhanced its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives across various sectors. Key programs include the Federal Skill Academy, aimed at upskilling underprivileged individuals to improve their employability, and "Speak For India," a platform designed to empower young thinkers.
