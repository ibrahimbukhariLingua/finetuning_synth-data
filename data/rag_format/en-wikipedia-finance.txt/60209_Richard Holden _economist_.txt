## Affiliation with Blueprint Institute

Upon its launch in mid-2020, Holden was appointed to the Strategic Council of the Blueprint Institute, an online think tank associated with moderate members of the Liberal Party.

The Blueprint Institute provides no transparency with respect to the identity of its financial backers. However, given that the Blueprint Institute was co-founded by Ian Hancock, the managing director of lobbying firms PremierNational and PremierState, and Lachlan Crombie, the Director of Government Relations at both firms, there has been speculation the organization is funded by the lobbyists as a front for the financial interests of their clients, particularly those in the renewable industry sector. Michael Photios, chairman, founder and owner of PremierNational and PremierState, sits on the Strategic Council of the Blueprint Institute alongside Holden.

Holden resigned from the Blueprint Institute's Strategic Council along with economists Gordon Leslie and Emilia Tjernstrom after being asked to endorse using $350,000 in donated funds to conduct polling in marginal and regional electorates on attitudes to climate change ahead of the upcoming federal election. The revelations around the proposed use of donor funds for clearly political and lobbying purposes also led to the resignations of the Blueprint Institute's Chief Economist, Steven Hamilton, and Director of Research, Daniel D'Hotman. Hamilton noted in a now deleted social media post that they believed the proposal "had the potential to undermine the integrity of Blueprint’s research, so felt our positions had become untenable.” In the months preceding these resignations, six members of the Blueprint Institute's Strategic Council ended their affiliation with the organisation.
