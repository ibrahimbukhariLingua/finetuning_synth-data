## Career

From 1991 to 1995, McNulty served as Pennsylvania Secretary of Revenue in the cabinet of Pennsylvania Governor Robert P. Casey. She then served in the Pennsylvania Office of the Budget from 2011 until 2013.

Nominated in 2015 by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf to be the Pennsylvania Secretary of Revenue, her appointment was confirmed by the Pennsylvania Senate in June 2015.

During her tenure as head of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue, she oversaw the planning and implementation of an identity theft division to protect commonwealth residents from tax fraud and help victims recover from identity theft crimes. The initiative reportedly saved the commonwealth more than six million dollars in 2016 alone. In addition, she oversaw her agency's redesign of its business service operations, a project which included the creation of an internet site that businesses could use to pay their taxes online.

In February 2017, she announced a tax amnesty program in an effort to encourage delinquent taxpayers who owed more than $1.1 billion in taxes to make their payments without having to pay fees for lien filings. It was her final administrative project as Secretary of Revenue. She retired from commonwealth service on April 21, 2017.
