# The Cambridge Building Society



**The Cambridge Building Society** is a UK mutual building society based in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. It is the 13th largest in the United Kingdom based on total assets of more than £1.8 billion at December 2022. It is a member of the Building Societies Association. It was formed in 1850 as the Cambridgeshire Permanent Benefit Building Society, adopting its current name in 1945.

There is no connection between the Cambridge Building Society and the Cambridge Foresters’ Benefit Building Society which was dissolved in 1960 or the Cambridge Peers Economic Building Society which was dissolved in 1972.


## History

Having been established in 1850, the society was based at 6 Post Office Terrace in Cambridge from 1884 until 1967 when it moved to new offices at 32 St. Andrews Street. Ten years after the move the first sub-branch opened in Mill Road.

In 1979 the society's assets reached £50 million and in the following years from 1980 to 1984 another four branches were opened.

By 1984 assets had reached £100 million. From 1985 to 1991 another six sub-branches were opened, and more savings products were launched. By 1991 assets had reached £250 million.

In the rest of the 1990s agency offices became full service branches, and another five branches opened. The society started to offer an increased range of products and moved to the present Head Office accommodation. By 2000 assets had reached £500 million.

2016 saw a number of changes to its branch network, with closure of the branches in Burwell, Chesterton, Mill Road, Milton and Soham reducing the branch network to 13.
