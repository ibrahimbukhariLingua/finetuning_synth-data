**Atolls** (formerly known as **Global Savings Group**, GSG) is a privately held international commerce content online savings, cashback and affiliate marketing company, that combines multiple savings portals in over 20 countries. The company owns CupoNation, Pepper.com and Coupons.com, as well as several other discount code and deal sites across Europe, and operates coupon portals for publishing houses.

## History

Global Savings Group was founded in 2012 by Andreas Fruth, Adrian Renner, and Gerhard Trautmann together with Rocket Internet. They had also previously collaborated on Dropgifts GmbH, a site that allowed users to engage in social and mobile gifting. In 2016 the company changed its name from CupoNation Group. In 2019, Global Savings Group acquired the UK-based money-saving browser extension provider Pouch for a cash purchase in the 7-figure US dollar range.
In 2020, Global Savings Group made a significant acquisition by purchasing iGraal, a leading French cashback company, for €123.5 million. The company continued its expansion in 2021 with the acquisition of Shoop, a prominent cashback platform based in Berlin. The exact amount of this acquisition remains undisclosed. GSG acquired US based consumer savings brand and domain Coupons.com in October 2022. In December 2022, Global Savings Group bought Pepper.com and its network of savings portals.


## Rebranding to Atolls

On September 11, 2024, the decision to rebrand to Atolls was announced, rooted in the company's strategic evolution and growth objectives. Atolls reflects the company's goal of creating digital destinations that align with consumers' shopping journeys. The name "Atolls" symbolizes essential stopovers for consumers in the retail ecosystem, akin to atolls in the ocean that serve as crucial stopovers for travelers.

Gerhard Trautmann, CEO of Atolls, has emphasized that the rebranding marks the company's commitment to innovation in shopping experiences, aiming to provide value to both consumers and partner brands. Over 12,000 brands and retailers collaborate with Atolls globally.


## Business model and operations

Atolls operates multiple shopping destinations, which include popular coupon and cashback platforms like Coupons.com, iGraal, and Shoop. It also manages several prominent online shopping communities, such as hotukdeals, mydealz, and Dealabs. These platforms assist consumers from the initial stages of product discovery to the final purchase decision, thereby supporting consumers in making informed spending decisions online.

The concept of "Atolls" not only signifies strategic consumer touchpoints but also reflects the interconnectedness of the company’s numerous platforms. This unified infrastructure is likened to individual islands within a larger reef system, creating a robust foundation for efficient global operations.
