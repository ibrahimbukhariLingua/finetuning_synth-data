## Controversies


### Bribery settlement

In May 2011, Tenaris agreed to pay the United States Department of Justice US$8.9 million in the first ever deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, after Tenaris voluntarily disclosed details of bribes made to officials of an Uzbek state-controlled oil firm to obtain competitor's bid information, which it used to submit revised bids in order to secure tenders.

On several occasions, melees broke out at the TenarisTamsa facility in Veracruz, Mexico, over a dispute for union leadership between Pascual Lagunes Ochoa and José Carlos Guevara Malpica ("El Profe"), a convicted felon. These melees have resulted in injuries and deaths.
