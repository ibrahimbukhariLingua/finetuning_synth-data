**Bourse** (pronounced [buʁs] ) is a station on Paris Métro Line 3, located in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris.

## History

It opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of the line opened between Père Lachaise and Villiers.¹⁸ It is named after the nearby Bourse de Paris (stock exchange) of which it provides a service, and at the center of which is built the Palais Brongniart, then known as the Palais de la Bourse because it housed the Paris Stock Exchange at the time. The latter sat there from 1828 to 1998 before being integrated into Euronext.

As part of the RATP's *Metro Renewal* program, the station's corridors were renovated on 11 July 2003, then the turn of the platforms in 2008.

In 2019, 3,386,481 travelers entered this station which places it at 148th position of metro stations for its usage.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Astérix and Obélix, as in eleven other stations. Taking up in particular the typography characteristic of the comics of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, the Bourse was humorously renamed *Sesterce*, from the name of the Roman currency in use during the last two centuries of the Roman Republic.
