Nicols summed up his own life view as reciprocity

> I believe in being rewarded for superior effort, harder work, ... you should benefit from that, but in the process of benefiting, you should never forget where you came from, and how can I use my good fortune to help those who are less fortunate. I think it’s about living life in balance.


## Edmonton Investors Group (EIG)

Nichols had played hockey and was a season-ticket holder of the Oilers hockey team in Edmonton. The Oilers were owned by Peter Pocklington, whose decisions regarding the team had disillusioned fans including a threat to move the team to the United States. In 1994 in return for taxpayer funds being used to refurbish the home ground Pocklington had agreed that local buyers would be given the right to purchase the team for cnd$100 before he could sell it to an American buyer. The Oilers were in financial difficulties but could receive league assistance if they could sell 13,000 season tickets and 90 percent of corporate boxes. In 1996, Nichols co-chaired the Friends of the Oilers (FOTO) ticket drive campaign, and mainly through his efforts the 13,000 season tickets deadline was reached. In 1997, when the franchise was put up for sale, he spearheaded the bid from a local ownership group EIG made up of 37/38 investors by co-ordinating raising the $60 million in equity required to purchase the team. His motivation for this was to see the team remain Edmonton remain as a "Major League City." He started his tenure as chairman of the EIG board in March 2000.

The Oilers became financially successful with Forbes valuing the club at US$146 million. The success of the Oilers brought a US$145 million offer from local billionaire Daryl Katz for the franchise, although Nichols subsequently said the team was not for sale. Daryl Katz upped the offer to US$150 million, but was turned down again.

On August 7, Katz made a third offer for the team of US$170 million. Nichols said the attempts to buy the team have caused "collateral damage" and he hoped the outright refusal brings closure to a vocal debate that has divided the group and the wider community since Katz's first offer. Nichols was quoted as saying "This is not about dollars. This is about Edmonton. An ownership group is best-suited for Edmonton and the Oilers.".

On December 13, 2007, Katz submitted a fourth formal offer to EIG to buy the franchise. The offer was $188 million to the EIG shareholders, plus another $100 million towards the building of a new arena in downtown Edmonton. The offer was accepted and Nichols resigned as chairman of the board of directors for the EIG in December 2007. and the 34 members of the EIG were paid out . Katz acknowledged the role of Niicols in the Oilers success, "If it wasn’t for Cal, the Oilers wouldn’t be in Edmonton."
