American Financial Group was one of the first publicly traded Fortune 500 companies to make political donations after corporations' freedom of speech rights were expanded to include donations as a result of the *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* decision. Carl Lindner, Jr is a longtime top Republican donor, donating millions of his personal income to candidates and political action committees, which sent ripples in campaign finance circles during the 2010 mid-term elections. American Financial, of which Lindner has a non-majority 42% share, donated $400,000 to the Republican-allied PAC American Crossroads.
