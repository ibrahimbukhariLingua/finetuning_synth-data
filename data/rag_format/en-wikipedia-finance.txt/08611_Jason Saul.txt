Saul teamed up with Pandora's chief musicologist Nolan Gasser in 2014 to design the *Impact Genome Project*. Inspired by both the Human Genome Project and the Music Genome Project, the project analyzes data to predict the outcomes of social programs. The project has a database of 78,000 different data points and uses information collected from thousands of evaluation studies of social programs. The *Impact Genome Project* is based on Saul's original work in developing the first common outcomes classification for the social sector. The project has received criticism from some in the field, stating that there are too many factors to measure which makes it difficult to predict the outcome of all social programs.

Saul serves on the faculty of Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, where he teaches corporate social responsibility and nonprofit management.
