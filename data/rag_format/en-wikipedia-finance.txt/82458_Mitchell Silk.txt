## Published work


### Books

Silk has published a book on Chinese environmental protection law titled: *China's marine environmental protection law: The dragon creeping in murky waters*, and several other books,
*Taiwan Trade and Investment Law*,
*Environmental Law and Policy in the People's Republic of China*.
In 2021, Silk co-authored with Singaporean banker Seth Tan Dancing with Giants: A Lawyer and Banker Share Their Passion for Infrastructure Finance. The book chronicles their experiences over the last several decades working on some of the largest cross-border infrastructure projects on almost every continent and at the highest levels of government and corporate organizations.

In addition to his several books on finance, Silk published a three volume, 2,000 page translation of the classic Kedushas Levi written by Rabbi Levi Yitzchok Derbarimdiger of Berditchev, one of the most popular figures in the Chassidic movement. This is the first ever complete publication of the complete translation of this work. He was a leader for and of the people, and this work delivers keen and timeless insights into human life, behavior, and psychology, and was as concerned with life in the real world as he was in providing profound meditations on Scripture. This publication launched Silk's ongoing project Chassidic Classics, an effort to render the canon classic Chassidic texts in accessible and readable English translation.
