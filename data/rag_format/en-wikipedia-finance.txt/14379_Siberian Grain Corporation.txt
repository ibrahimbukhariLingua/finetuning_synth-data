# Siberian Grain Corporation



**Siberian Grain Corporation** is a company headquartered in Novosibirsk, Russia. It was founded in 1991 by Dmitry Tereshkov. The company includes a number of enterprises operating in several regions of Russia.


## History

The company was founded in 1991 by Dmitry Tereshkov and was originally called the Siberian Contract Corporation (SCC), it provided intermediary services, the company took orders, then purchased the necessary raw materials for the implementation of orders, entered into contracts with enterprises for the processing of raw materials, after which it sold finished products.

In 1994, the company began to develop the grain business. At that time, the system of state financing of rural industry was on the verge of collapse, bread factories experienced great difficulties due to a lack of grain. Tereshkov made the following proposal to the Government of the Novosibirsk Oblast: SCC takes a bank loan and buys 70,000 tons of grain, but the loan rate should be half compensated by the regional government. Regional authorities agreed with the proposal. The plants manufactured products but were unable to pay the debt, after which Tereshkov took another loan and bought two factories that owed him (two enterprises belonging to the Voskhod Association).

In 1997, the Siberian Contract Corporation was renamed into the Siberian Grain Corporation. In the same year Tereshkov and Boris Serebryany (founder of the *Fiera Foods* from Canada) created the Voskhod-Beiker Company in Novosibirsk for the production of parbaked bread.

In the late 1990s, Tereshkov bought three factories in Ufa and entered the Ural market.

In 2005, in Mytishchi near Moscow, the company opened a second enterprise producing parbaked bread.

In 2006, Voskhod-Beiker was renamed Bon Ape.
