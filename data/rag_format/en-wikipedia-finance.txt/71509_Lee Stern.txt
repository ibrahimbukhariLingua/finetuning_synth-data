## Victim of illegal activities

On October 22, 1992, Darrell Zimmerman of Chicago, Illinois and Anthony Catalfo of Bayside, Queens, New York, attempted to manipulate the US Treasury bond futures and options market of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The gist of the scam was to depress prices long enough for Zimmerman and Catalfo to turn a sizable profit. Catalfo reportedly profited approximately $1,500,000 but Zimmerman lost nearly $9,000,000, for which his clearing firm, Lee B. Stern & Company, would be held liable. After the suspension of trading and clearing privileges of Lee B. Stern & Company and its three principals Lee Stern, son Daniel Stern, and Lester Moucher, the Chicago Board of Trade had the suspension expunged on October 28, 1992.

A CBOT arbitration panel found Zimmerman and Catalfo guilty of fraud and conspiracy, fining Zimmerman $1,500,000 and Catalfo $750,000 and ordered them jointly liable to Lee B. Stern & Co. for $8.6 million in damages. On July 6, 1994, Catalfo was found guilty of six counts of wire fraud by a Federal jury and sentenced to 42 months in prison. Zimmerman fled to Vancouver, BC Canada and fought extradition.
