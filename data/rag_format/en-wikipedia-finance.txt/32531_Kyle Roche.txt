# Kyle Roche



**Kyle Roche** is an American attorney known for his work in cryptocurrency litigation. However, a series of controversial events significantly downgraded his career.


## Early life and education

Kyle Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo, New York. He was the oldest of four siblings, sharing a bedroom with his intellectually disabled twin brothers. This upbringing instilled in him a determination to succeed and provide for his family. Roche attended Purdue University for his undergraduate studies and later worked as a management consultant before enrolling at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law. During law school, he developed a strong interest in cryptocurrency, earning a significant profit from Bitcoin investments, which he used to pay his tuition.


## Career


### Rise to Prominence

Roche began his legal career at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he quickly became known as an expert in cryptocurrency law. His involvement in high-profile cases, such as representing Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, who claimed to be Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, established his reputation. This case, which sought to resolve the ownership of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, drew significant attention and highlighted Roche's capabilities in handling complex cryptocurrency disputes.


### Founding Roche Freedman

In 2019, Roche co-founded the law firm Roche Freedman with Velvel Freedman, a colleague from Boies Schiller Flexner. The firm made headlines by filing numerous class-action lawsuits against various cryptocurrency companies, alleging securities fraud and other violations. These lawsuits positioned Roche as a significant figure in cryptocurrency litigation, earning him praise and criticism.


### Controversies and Downfall

In January 2022, Roche's career took a dramatic turn. After a meeting in London with businessmen Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar and Christen Ager-Hanssen, where the latter pressed his index finger to Mr. Roche's forehead, Roche found himself at the center of a scandal. In the summer of 2022, a Crypto Leaks website published secretly recorded Roche videos. The videos depicted Roche making potentially compromising statements about his law firm's relationship with Ava Labs, a cryptocurrency company. They suggested that he had used litigation to protect Ava Labs' interests and harm its competitors.

Roche claimed the videos were "illegally obtained" and "spliced out of context," but the damage was done. Several companies sued by Roche Freedman moved to disqualify the firm from their cases, leading to Roche's resignation from the firm he founded.


## Criticism

Roche faced significant criticism for his comments in the leaked videos, which many interpreted as evidence of unethical behavior and conflicts of interest. He was accused of using litigation to serve the interests of a single client, Ava Labs, at the expense of other clients and the broader legal system. This perception of impropriety severely tarnished his reputation and led to widespread disqualification motions against Roche Freedman.
