Copper was discovered in the area in the late 1800s. Shares for the Mount Hope mining venture were successfully floated in Melbourne and in 1906 were oversubscribed. In 1907, the “Mount Hope Limited” mining activities were reported on, including the amount in tonnes of resources mined. In April 1908 the mine at Mount Hope closed for a time. There are a number of copper mines that closed or have similarly operated sporadically mining various minerals in the Mt Isa area. The Lolworth workings were also included operations on the Mount Hope lease and were sometimes referred to as Mount Hope operations.
