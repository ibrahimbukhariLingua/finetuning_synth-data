# Mumtalakat Holding Company



**Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Company B.S.C.** (Mumtalakat) is the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Bahrain. It was established by Royal Decree in 2006 and is wholly owned by the Government. Mumtalakat actively sought investment opportunities locally, regionally and internationally.

In December 2024, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, the fund has nearly $17.6 billion in assets under management.

Mumtalakat invests in assets unrelated to either oil or gas across different sectors including education, aviation, healthcare, consumer and financial services, industrial manufacturing, real estate, tourism and logistics. From its inception in 2006, Mumtalakat initially pursued investments primarily in Bahrain, with just 3% apportioned abroad; in 2019, that figure rose to 30%, comprising investments in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and North Africa consisting of both minority and majority stakes in its portfolio companies. Mumtalakat Holding Company B.S.C. is based in the Arcapita Building, Bahrain Bay, Bahrain.
