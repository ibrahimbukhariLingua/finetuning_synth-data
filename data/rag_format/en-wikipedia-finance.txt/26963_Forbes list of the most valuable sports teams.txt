According to the latest ranking from December 12, 2024:

> For the ninth straight year, the Dallas Cowboys are the world’s most valuable sports team, worth an estimated $10.1 billion—the first to cross the 11-figure threshold and $1.3 billion beyond their closest competition. But there is plenty of movement among the top 50 teams, with 12 NBA franchises now flooding the ranking, double the six on last year’s list and led by the Golden State Warriors, worth an estimated $8.8 billion and No. 2 overall.

> The influx of NBA teams comes at the expense of Major League Baseball, which lost two teams in the top 50 (the Chicago Cubs and the San Francisco Giants); Formula 1, which had both of its outfits fall out (Ferrari and Mercedes); and the NFL, which is now missing the Buffalo Bills. (Because of a tie at No. 50 this year between the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals and the NBA’s Phoenix Suns, six new teams join the ranking while only five teams depart.

> The NFL, however, continues to dominate the list with 29 franchises.

Besides the Buffalo Bills, the Cincinnati Bengals and the Detroit Lions are the only other NFL teams not in the top 50.

Soccer, which had eight clubs in the top 50 a decade ago, including the top three spots, now has seven teams spread across four leagues, with Real Madrid of Spain’s La Liga leading the way at $6.6 billion, tied for 12th overall.

MLB, which had five teams in the top 50 a year ago, now has only three, with the New York Yankees leading the way. Although their value increased from $7.1 billion in 2023 to $7.55 billion in 2024, they dropped from 2nd to 4th overall.
