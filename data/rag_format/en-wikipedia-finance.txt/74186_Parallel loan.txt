Parallel loan


# Parallel loan



A **parallel loan** is two loans taken out by two pairs of companies in different countries from local lenders with the aim of swapping the resulting loans in different currencies. It was an early form of currency swap.

In a parallel loan there is an exchange of currencies between four parties which promises that the loan will be repaid at a specified future date and predetermined exchange rate.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It consists of two pairs of the affiliated companies and two pairs parents companies in two different countries.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It occurs between two companies simultaneously when a company has a relative advantage in the cost of funds and then borrows those funds to a foreign affiliate in its own country at a rate lower than the foreign affiliate would have to pay at its parent company's country.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Besides that, the parallel loan is “similar to cross-border loan, but there are no currencies in the foreign exchange markets”.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The parallel loan is very similar to a back-to-back loan. The parallel loan was one of the proactive management of operating exposure that offsetting expected foreign exchange exposure. Two business companies in different countries will borrow currency to each other for a particular period of time and they will return the borrowed currencies on the date they agreed to with the same loaned amount. The two loans will be valued at the prevailing spot rate and the prescribed period. The currencies borrowing activities conducted outside the foreign exchange market to avoid foreign exchange risk and legal limitations.


## History

The parallel loan was established in the early 1970s in effect of the exchange controls in the United Kingdom on British companies.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The implementation of exchange control has caused many British firms withdrawn their decision to extend their business because investing in foreign market is not attractive. After the abolition of foreign exchange control in 1979, parallel loan kept on being utilized with the goal of hedging long-term foreign currency exposure at a lower cost than what will be imposed in the foreign exchange market.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ At that time, UK organizations needed to pay a premium to get a loan in US dollars. In order to prevent this situation, UK organizations set up parallel or back-to-back loan agreement with US organizations that wish to acquire sterling.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The parallel loan market was created to avoid confinements imposed by the Bank of England on the free stream of British pounds. Most of the British companies who are desire to invest abroad need to change pounds into US dollars at an exchange rate over the market exchange rate. The motivation behind this strategy was to safeguard the value of the pound among other currencies. However, companies actually were not keen on providing financial aid to the Bank of England by committing the above-market rate for every dollar obtained from the exchange rate implemented in the policy. Prevention for these currency control leads straightforwardly to the improvement of the market for the currency swaps.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Initiated as a way of avoiding currency regulations, the practice had, by the mid-1990s, largely been replaced by currency swaps.
