¡Allá tú!


# ¡Allá tú!



***¡Allá tú!*** (Spanish for "It's Your Business") is the Spanish version of *Deal or No Deal*. It was initially broadcast by Telecinco between 2004 and 2008 and later changed to sister channel Cuatro for a comeback in 2011, before returning to Telecinco in 2023.

The original version was hosted by Jesús Vázquez, but during Jesús's break to focus on another Endemol show, *Operación Triunfo*, Silvia Jato and Arturo Valls filled in for him. He reprised his role as host on both revivals.

This version is very similar to the French and Italian versions, with 22 boxes held by 22 players representing 22 regions of Spain (except for the 2006 specials, which played like the US version, with 26 cases held by 26 models).

On June 19, 2007, Gilbert from Tarragona became the first top prize winner, winning €600,000. On July 25, 2011, Maria del Carmen Bonilla from Asturias won €300,000 and became the second top prize winner.


## Gameplay


### 2004–2008

The program begins by each contestant being described by name and region (usually the newest contestant to replace the one who played last episode receives a special presentation), and then they answer a qualifying question, usually about statistics (i.e. "What percentage of the Spanish elderly have used the Internet? 1: 6%, 2: 26%, 3: 69%"). Out of those who answered correctly, one is drawn, who proceeds to the podium with the box they randomly selected before the game. Each box contains a different amount of money, from €0.10 to €300,000 (or one of 3 joke prizes).

In the main game, the contestant's objective is to find out what their box contains by removing the boxes of the other 21 contestants: when each box is selected, the card with the box's value on is shown to the camera before the value of the card is out of play, and the display shows the amounts remaining.

At various points in the game, *La Banca* (The Banker) makes a phone call to the host and makes the contestant a cash offer to purchase their box and for the contestant to quit the game based on the value of the boxes left. The contestant then decides whether to accept the offer and end the game or decline the offer and continue playing.

In the first round the contestant opens six boxes, three in the second, third, fourth, and fifth, and then one in the final two rounds. One player plays for the entire episode. When their episode finishes, a new contestant replaces them in the wings.

In 2005, the show started a phone-in feature where the in-studio contestant would split their winnings with a lucky at-home caller. As a result, many values on the board were increased, with the top prize doubling to €600,000.


#### 2006 Special

In 2006, ¡Allá tú! aired a primetime special based on the US version called *La Noche de los 2.000.000€* (*The €2,000,000 Night*), with a new set similar to the US version and 26 cases held by models (as opposed to 22 boxes held by other contestants). The special featured two contestants, each playing for €1,000,000 (split with an at-home caller, like the daytime version).


### 2011 version

The show was revived in 2011 on Telecinco's sister network Cuatro, with the original board and a new twist—the Green Boxes.


### 2023–2024

The first season of the 2023 revival aired on Sunday nights as a weekly prime time format with a runtime similar to that of the 2006 million-euro specials. The show featured two contestants on each episode, each playing for a top prize of €250,000. The revival introduced two new elements to the gameplay:

* *El pulsador de la oferta extra* (The Extra Offer Buzzer): Before hearing the first offer, the player is asked to guess how much money the Banker has offered to purchase the box. If the player guesses correctly or is off by €1,000 or less, they have the option to activate the buzzer and request one additional offer from the Banker, aside from the ones that happen when specific numbers of boxes remain, at any time in the game.
* *La comunidad de la suerte* (The Lucky Region): The Banker can offer the player to abandon the game if it isn't going well, and instead try to guess which Spanish region is written in a smaller, silver box. The player wins €30,000 for guessing correctly in the first attempt and €10,000 for guessing correctly in the second attempt, but the player leaves without any money if neither guess is correct.

The second season was a daily format, akin to the original version, airing Monday thru Thursday (later Monday thru Wednesday) each week. As a result of the change in format, one contestant was featured each episode, and the top prize was lowered to €150,000. Additionally, the prizes for *La comunidad de la suerte* were cut in half to €15,000 for the first attempt and €5,000 for the second attempt.
