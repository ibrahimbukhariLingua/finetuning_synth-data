List of companies of Iraq


# List of companies of Iraq



Iraq is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which as 2021, provides about 92% of foreign exchange earnings. The lack of development in other sectors has resulted in 13% unemployed as of 2017 per capita GDP of $7,000. Public sector employment accounted for nearly 60% of full-time employment in 2011. The oil export industry, which dominates the Iraqi economy, generates very little employment. Currently only a modest percentage of women (the highest estimate for 2011 was 22%) participate in the labour force.
