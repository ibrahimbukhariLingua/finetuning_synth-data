In 1999, the Booths gave $10 million for construction of the Charles M. Harper Center building on the University of Chicago campus.

The Booths gave $9 million to the University of Kansas in 2004 to fund the Booth Family Hall of Athletics attached to Allen Fieldhouse.

The Booth family pledged $300 million in November 2008 to the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, where David Booth earned an MBA in 1971.
