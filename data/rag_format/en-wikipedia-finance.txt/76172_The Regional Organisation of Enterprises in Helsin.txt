## History

The founding meeting of the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki was held 10 January 1939. At that time the members consisted mainly of industry associations but soon more and more independent entrepreneurs became members.

Due to the change in regulations in 1962, the name of the organisation was changed to Suur-Helsingin Yrittäjät ry and the organisational activities and number of members increased. Caused by the strong development of the region, several structural solutions were implemented and organisation's activities took their current form. In addition, Espoo and Vantaa founded their own regional organisations in 1979, thus the responsibilities of these strongly developing and growing regions were divided and organisational activities redefined.

The original mission statement: bring entrepreneurs together, influence and safeguard the common interests, has never changed its core. The most significant change is its key function: the nature of the organisation as an information, mentoring, networking, events and educational opportunities provider for its members.

In 2009 the Regional Organisation of Enterprises in Helsinki celebrated its 70th anniversary. In the same year the organisation hosted the National Entrepreneur's Day at the Helsinki Fair Centre.
