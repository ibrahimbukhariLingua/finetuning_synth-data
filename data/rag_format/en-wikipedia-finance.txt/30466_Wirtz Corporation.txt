# Wirtz Corporation



**Wirtz Corporation** is an American holding company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1926 by Arthur Wirtz as a family-owned corporation to oversee his real estate holdings. The company shortly thereafter expanded into liquor distribution. The company grew significantly throughout the 20th century by purchasing many competing liquor distributors, as well as the Chicago Blackhawks NHL team (becoming full owners in 1966), and the Chicago Bulls NBA team in 1972 (Wirtz Corp. sold the Bulls to Jerry Reinsdorf in 1985). Wirtz Corporation is part owner of the United Center arena, and also owns banking and insurance interests.

After founder Arthur Wirtz's death in 1983, his son, William, took control of the corporation and ran it until his death in 2007. The company's next owner and CEO, (William's son) Rocky Wirtz died in 2023, being succeeded by his son Danny Wirtz.
