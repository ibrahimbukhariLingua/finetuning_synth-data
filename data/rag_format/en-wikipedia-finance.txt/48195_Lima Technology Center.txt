## History

The Lima Technology Center is a development by Lima Land, Inc. (LLI), a 60-40 joint venture of local firm Alsons Land Inc. and Japanese company Marubeni The Alcantara Group originally had the majority stakes in Alsons Land. "Lima" in its name was derived from the first syllables of Lipa and Malvar, the location of the center.

The Aboitiz Group through its subsidiary Aboitiz Land started acquiring LLI in the early 2010s. In 2013, it bought out the Alcantara Group's majority stakes in LLI. At that time the area covers around 200 ha (490 acres). The following year, it bought the remaining stakes owned by Marubeni making Aboitiz the full owner of LLI.

Under the Aboitiz Group, the Lima Technology Center was further expanded, covering an area of more than 700 ha (1,700 acres) by 2020.
