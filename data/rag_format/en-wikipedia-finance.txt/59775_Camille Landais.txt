## Research

Camille Landais' research interests include taxation, social insurance and pro-social behaviours. The key findings of his research include the following:

* Denmark's preferential foreigner tax scheme doubled the ratio between of highly paid foreigners in Denmark relative to slightly less paid and thus ineligible foreigners, implying a large tax elasticity of migration among high income earners, but also reduced the pre-tax earnings of eligible foreigners relative to those of non-eligible ones by 5–10% (with Henrik Jacobsen Kleven, Emmanuel Saez and Esben Anton Schultz).
* Football players in Europe, especially when outside their home country, are very sensitive to taxation, with low taxes attracting high-ability players who displace low-ability ones and low taxes on foreigners displacing domestic players.
