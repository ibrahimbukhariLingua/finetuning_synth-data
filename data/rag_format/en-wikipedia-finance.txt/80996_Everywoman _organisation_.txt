# Everywoman (organisation)



**Everywoman** (stylized in all lowercase) is a membership organization based in the United Kingdom that advocates for advancement of women in business to close the gender pay gap. It provides personal development resources, leadership training, events, award programmes, networking opportunities and inspiration for women in business and female entrepreneurs. It works closely with government, opinion formers and business support organisations, with sponsors including Bupa, NatWest and Specsavers.


## Background

It was founded in September 1999 by Karen Gill and Maxine Benson, after they felt frustrated with the lack of resources available for women in business. Karen Gill and Maxine Benson were awarded MBEs in the New Year's Honours 2009 for their services to women's enterprise.

## Modern Muse

In November 2010, everywoman launched the Modern Muse project, designed to engage the next generation of female business leaders and entrepreneurs by showcasing women of today in all walks of business life, running a schools outreach programme offering work experience, internships, career advice and mentorship. Its goal was to reach out to one million young women and girls to inspire them to look at business careers and entrepreneurship.

In 2021 the Trustees determined that the schools outreach programme would cease and the role of Modern Muse would be to support organisations with a shared mission: The Prince's Trust, which helps young people access training and jobs, and TechSheCan, whose mission is to level the gender playing field in the technology space.
