## History

MaritzCX was formed in January 2015, after Maritz Holdings bought Allegiance, Inc., in November 2014. After working together for several years, the two companies paired Allegiance's innovative CX software and Maritz's research and strategic consulting industries. Emerging as MaritzCX, the firm had over 900 employees and earned nearly $200 million in revenue during its first year. In June 2017, MaritzCX partnered with a fintech and consultant company Protiviti Inc.

In February 2020, MaritzCX merged with InMoment, retaining the InMoment brand. The deal was backed by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners which already had a stake in InMoment since May 2019.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
