# CBIZ CPAs



**CBIZ CPAs** (formerly known as **Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C.)** is a national CPA firm founded and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. MHM has over 30 offices in the United States.


## History

MHM dates back to 1954 with Ernst D. Mayer in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1960 the practice merged with Bill Hoffman's practice. MHM officially became Mayer Hoffman McCann in 1978 when Chuck McCann was added as a managing partner.

In August 2024, Mayer Hoffman McCann changed its name to CBIZ CPAs to "better align CBIZ CPAs' attest practice with CBIZ's non-attest practice".


### Association with CBIZ Inc.

* In 1998 MHM spun off its tax and consulting practice, which was merged into Century Business Services, Inc, now known as CBIZ, Inc.

MHM maintains an association with CBIZ through an administrative services agreement and practices public accounting through an alternative practice structure as defined in American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Ethics Interpretation 101â€“14. However, MHM is owned and managed by its CPA shareholders.
