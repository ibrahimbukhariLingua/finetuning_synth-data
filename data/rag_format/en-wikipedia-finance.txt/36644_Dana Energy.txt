# Dana Energy



**Dana Energy** (Persian: شرکت انرژی دانا) is a private oil and gas company headquartered in Tehran, Iran. It is an exploration and production (E&P) and oilfield services company operating in Middle East and Asia. Formed in 2000, they were initially an oilfield services company and ventured into field development in 2008. By the addition of petroleum products trading to its portfolio in 2013, Dana Energy extended their business into the midstream sector, however due to sanctions imposed on Iran, their trading division came to a halt.


## History

Dana Energy was established in 2000 in Tehran, as a privately held company with the main purpose of providing service to upstream oil and gas projects. The company started its first seismic project and service provision for Iran's upstream sector in 2002. In 2003, they embarked on seismic services in Iran's south western oil fields. In 2006, the company got involved in the execution of drilling projects and the provision of rig and drilling services.

Their onshore drilling services and rig lease began in 2007. Dana Energy was awarded drilling contracts in 2008 for 225 wells in Phases 15&16 of South Pars, and in 2011 drilled another 22 wells in phases 17&18. A year later, the first international experience was carried out by fulfilling two seismic projects in Pakistan. In 2013, their petroleum products trading commenced and in 2015, the new corporate governance model was launched. The new governance model restructured the company by transitioning from a holding structure to a corporate one, consolidating all its divisions and subsidiaries under a single brand. The rebranding coincided with this change, ensuring that the visual identity of the brand aligns with the new business approach, which aims to be more dynamic, streamlined, and efficient.

Dana Energy was the first privately held company in Iran to qualify as an E&P company by NIOC in June 2016.

### Logo Evolution

The initial logo for the brand was introduced in early 2000s, drawing inspiration from the Sun as a symbol of paramount and universal energy source. The incorporation of a flame element further echoes the essence of the company's role in the energy sector. Subsequently, in 2015, the brand logo underwent a redesign, accompanied by the development of detailed visual identity guidelines.


### Slogan

The company's slogan is "***Powering Nations, EnergyWise***."


## Business Segments and Units

Dana Energy is currently organized into three business segments: Exploration and Production, Oilfield Services and Investment.


### Exploration and production

A deal was struck on 14 December 2008, for Dana Energy to acquire Petroiran Company under the privatization law, which permitted the government to sell its assets. The purchase, however, wasn't finalized. The acquisition was initially conducted following Dana Energy's strategy in becoming an E&P company.

Since its qualification, Dana Energy has signed several Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) with international oil companies for development studies on Iranian oilfields. These MoU include: Austria's OMV for Band-e-Karkheh, Norway's DNO for Changuleh Sohrab, West-Paydar and Aban are other oilfields that have been studied by Dana Energy and their partners. Dana Energy signed another MoU with NIOC or the development study of Sepher and Jufeyr oilfields.


### Oilfield services

Dana Energy's OFS segment includes Geophysical Services, Geotechnical Drilling, Drilling Operations, Well Services, Drill Bit and Downhole Tools, Oil Tools and their most recent business unit, Tubular Connections.

Over the years, the company has carried out several offshore and onshore projects, mostly in the southern and western parts of Iran, with South Pars being one of their most prominent megaprojects.

44 wells were drilled in total in Phases 15, 16, 17, and 18 with contracts exceeding US$1.7 billion. The company has a record of drilling 497 meters a day in well SPD16-06. More than 6,000 meters were perforated in less than two months with minimum nonproductive time. Dana Energy has also carried out simultaneous operations (SIMOPS) which included, drilling new wells, acidizing and clean-up of finished wells whilst producing gas in phase 15. This job was one of a kind in the region and was successfully managed with high safety standards. Dana Energy provided cementing and stimulating services in Phases 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21 of the South Pars.


#### Geophysical services

Dana Energy's Geophysical Services specializes in 2D and 3D data acquisition, employing advanced techniques like structural interpretation and velocity model building. For non-seismic services, they provide solutions from survey design to geological interpretation, maintaining an extensive non-seismic equipment fleet. They have also completed gravity/magnetic projects in oil and gas exploration.

The company is equipped with a data processing center. In 2012, this department was awarded the contract for Bibihakimeh project, which was the largest mountainous 3D seismic operation in Iran. This project was located in south west of Iran, covering 1627 km² and 106,222 shot points were recorded in this project.

In 2016, Dana Energy signed an agreement with France's CGG Services SA to cooperate in defining, execution and implementation of onshore seismic data acquisition and processing projects in Iran.

Dana Energy's Geophysical Services international activities started in Pakistan, where two 3D seismic data acquisitions in Ratana and Sadiqabad and a 2D seismic data acquisition in Hisal were carried out.

In early 2023, the company started the Haftkel Nafte Sefid project, which is Iran's largest seismic 3D land survey to date. The projects aims to acquire complementary 3D seismic data for the Haftkel field and to identify the relationship between Haftkel, Nafte Sefid and other prospect fields.

Among Dana Energy's accomplishments is the drilling of the deepest vertical offshore well, achieved through MLS technology in the Belal project. Additionally, the company has successfully completed onshore drilling projects in the Azadegan and Nargesi fields, along with workover projects in the West Paydar fields.

Dana Energy has invested in the Carbon Bared Factory, a unique project in Iran that captures CO2 emissions from Tehran Oil Refinery to produce liquid CO2. With the support of Dana Energy, the factory has achieved sustainable operations and a 31% reduction in refinery CO2 emissions. Currently, it produces 75-80 tonnes of liquid CO2 per day, serving industries like coolant, disinfectant, and automotive. The recovered CO2, equivalent to the carbon absorbed by over 1.2 million mature trees, underscores the factory's contribution to positive climate action and green technology investments.

Another investment by Dana Energy is the Kurdeh solar farm, a 10-megawatt capacity power plant supplying electricity to approximately 2,000 households. Operating as a decentralized energy source, the plant covers a 20-hectare plot of land and is equipped with 30,000 solar panels and 66 inverters.
