Superior Air Charter


# Superior Air Charter



**Superior Air Charter** (previously **JetSuite)** is a private jet charter company based out of Dallas, Texas. The company was founded in 2006 by Alex Wilcox. In 2008, the company was re-branded from **Magnum Jet** after a push from financial backers. Wilcox is CEO of the company.

On April 17, 2020, JetSuite, as it was called then, halted operations and furloughed most of its crew members due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 28, 2020, JetSuite's parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. JetSuite has safely operated over 111,000 flights since 2009. In September 2020, the company closed the Chapter 11 filing and retired the name JetSuite. Flying recommenced in November 2020 as Superior Air Charter, operating 3 Phenom 100 aircraft.


## History

JetSuite was born out of a re-branding of Magnum Jet after the company's financial backers decided to restructure the company. As part of this restructuring, the company also steered away from advertising as an “air taxi” with shared rides and began focusing solely on private charter flights.

Alex Wilcox, a JetBlue founding executive, is the company's CEO. Wilcox has over two decades of airline industry experience and has been named a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute. In addition to receiving funding by private investors in 2010, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh invested $7 million into JetSuite in 2011.

Early on, the company was recognized for streamlining its business through the use of four-passenger Embraer Phenom 100s as its primary aircraft. This simplifies maintenance and piloting. Moreover, these planes are fuel efficient because they consume 90 gallons of gas in an hour versus more than 230 gallons per hour on some other private jets.

In 2013, JetSuite installed Aircell WiFi for its Phenom fleet.

In 2018, Qatar Airways became a minority stakeholder in JetSuite. In 2018, the company appointed Stephanie Chung as its new president, making her the first African American to lead a major private aviation company.

On April 15, 2020, the company announced it was grounding the entire JetSuite fleet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 28, 2020, JetSuite's parent company Superior Air Charter LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with Wilcox attributing the company's collapse to a 90% decrease in business caused by widespread stay-at-home orders.

In November 2020, JetSuite recommenced operations as Superior Air Charter.
