## History

Jirnexu was formerly known as Saving Plus. In 2012, former Citi banker Yuen Tuck Siew and James Barnes founded RinggitPlus.com, a comparison and application website for financial products in Malaysia. The website was officially launched in 2013 to allow comparison of and application for credit cards, home loans, car loans, investments and insurance schemes.

In 2014, RinggitPlus.com merged with SaveMoney.my, an online portal that provides information on different credit cards, car loans, phone, travel and shopping in Malaysia. SaveMoney.my was founded by Liew Ooi Hann and Lucas Ooi in 2012. Following the merger, Saving Plus Sdn Bhd was incorporated while RinggitPlus.com continued to operate as a comparison website.

In 2016, Saving Plus rebranded itself to Jirnexu; the name means "prosper" in Maltese. The company launched XpressApply, an online application and CRM technology.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
