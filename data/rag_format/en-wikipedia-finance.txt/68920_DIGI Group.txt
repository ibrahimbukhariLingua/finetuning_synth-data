# DIGI Group



**DIGI** (**Teraoka/DIGI Group**) is a global corporation with offices in Japan, Europe and North America. Founded in 1925, it supplies weighing and packaging equipment for trade, industries, and logistics. Its products are widely used in the manufacturing, retail, and consumer fields. The company occupies 30% of the Russian market of weighing scales.

Although the company dates back to 1925, its activity dates back to 1910, when industrialist Teraoka Toyonaru created the Japan Calculation Machinery Manufacturing Co, which was focused on innovative technologies and supporting inventions. It produced precision instruments for industries and consumers. At the time of its inception, Teraoka had already developed weight scales capable of functioning under different temperature environments, which had been patented in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. Establishing itself firmly in its market, Teraoka Takeharu, son of Toyonaru, started the Teraoka Research Center (Teraoka Seiko Co., Ltd.), which would eventually form part of Teraoka/DIGI Group. The corporation presently operates five R&D centres and five production sites across Europe and Asia, as well as its own line of strain gauges.
