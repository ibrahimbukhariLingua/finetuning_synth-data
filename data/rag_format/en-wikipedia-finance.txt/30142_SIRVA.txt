Several other acquisitions followed in 2002 and 2003. the firm recognized a trend with corporate customers outsourcing all aspects of an employee relocation to relocation service providers, including household goods relocation. As a result, the firm acquired the relocation services businesses of Cooperative Resource Services (CRS) in May 2002. Another relocation services provider acquisition, Rowan Simmons in the UK, followed later that year. The firm opened an office in Hong Kong in 2003 and acquired another relocation services provider, PRS Europe of Belgium, in 2003.
