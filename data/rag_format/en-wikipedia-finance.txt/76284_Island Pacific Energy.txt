Island Pacific Energy


# Island Pacific Energy



**Island Pacific Energy** is a solar installation company and solar energy facility provider in the State of Hawaii.


## History

Island Pacific Energy was founded in 2007 as a solar energy provider. The original headquarters were located at the Manoa Innovation Center. In 2009, Island Pacific Energy moved their offices to the Foreign Trade Zone located at 521 Ala Moana Blvd in Honolulu, Hawaii.

As a solar energy provider, Island Pacific Energy owns, operates and maintains the photovoltaic systems on the roofs of commercial and non-profit entities and sells the clean renewable energy that is generated to the customer under long term power purchase agreements. This arrangement enables customers who cannot take advantage of the incentives (tax credits) to still reap the economic benefits of solar power. Island Pacific Energy was the first company to execute a power purchase agreement with a non-profit entity in the state of Hawaii.

In 2009, the company expanded their offering to include the installation of photovoltaic systems for residential and commercial customers.

Island Pacific Energy currently operates a portfolio of solar energy facilities as well as actively installs photovoltaic systems for residential, commercial, non-profit and government entities.
