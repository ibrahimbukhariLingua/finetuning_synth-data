Abdul Rahman presented the Supply Bill for 2007/2008 at the LegCo meeting on 6 March 2007 at the International Convention Centre in Berakas. On the same day, he explained that the increase in the budget for the PMO was due to the special salary adjustment introduced in June 2006, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in the police force, and several ongoing projects such as maintenance. He also announced the government's estimated income for the 2007/2008 financial year, projected at B$1.855 billion, primarily from the oil and gas sector, while forecasting a 2.6–3% growth despite fluctuations in global oil prices.

The 2008 agreement between Brunei and India on investment promotion and protection was signed by Abdul Rahman and P. Chidambaram. Representing Brunei, he focused on promoting economic cooperation and safeguarding investments in both countries. The agreement ensures free fund flow, protection from expropriation, nondiscriminatory treatment, and outlines dispute resolution through arbitration. These measures, aimed at supporting economic progress, commercial ventures, and technology transfer, were largely formalised through his efforts.
