## History

Ohio National was founded as a stock company in 1909 but converted to mutual company status in 1959. In 1998, Ohio National reorganized as a mutual insurance holding company (Ohio National Mutual Holdings, Inc.), with an intermediate holding company (Ohio National Financial Services, Inc.).

The company signed a contract to take over a facility at Lunken Airport from Executive Jet Management around 2000.

In September 2018, Ohio National announced an exit from most of the annuity market, and the layoff of approximately 300 of its then 1300 employees, as part of a new focused growth strategy targeting the life insurance market. Ohio National continues to sell life insurance, disability insurance, and immediate annuities, and reaffirmed its commitment to the Latin American market. As a result of the change in strategy, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating from A+ to A, while Moody's reaffirmed its A1 rating and A.M. Best reaffirmed its A+ rating.
