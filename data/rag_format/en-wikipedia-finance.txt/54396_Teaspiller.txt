Teaspiller


# Teaspiller



**Teaspiller** was a US-based web application for customers to find accountants and hire them to do their taxes and accounting online. In 2013 the company was acquired by Intuit, Inc and added to its TurboTax product line. The Teaspiller employees and code were all acquired and the product was renamed as "TurboTax CPA select".

It enabled accountants to work remotely with clients (share files, send secure messages, schedule appointments), as well as find new clients looking for their specific skills through a complex search algorithm. This was done through extended profiles containing licensing information, professional histories, user ratings, peer endorsements, association memberships, and practice areas.

The service had been called an H&R Block killer by Business Insider as it helped customers find accountants to prepare tax returns online. As of 2011ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ it had 20,000 US accountants listed on the site. The application was built using the Django framework.
