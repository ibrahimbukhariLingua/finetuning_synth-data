## History

Libertel was founded in September 1995 with financial backing from Nationale-Nederlanden (NN) to compete with KPN. Libertel was the second company in the Netherlands to get a license for offering GSM services (after PTT Telecom).

The corporate structure started with a holding partnership named *CV Gemeenschapplijk Bezit Libertel* containing three wholly owned subsidiaries: Libertel Groep B.V. (the holding company), Libertel B.V. (the cellular network operator), and Liberfone BV (the service provider).

The six original shareholders were ING, Vodafone, Vendex, Liof, Internatio-Müller, and Macintosh Retail Group. In early 1998, Vendex and Liof both sold their shares for 120 million guilders.
