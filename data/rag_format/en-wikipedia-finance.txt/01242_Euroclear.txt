Euroclear


# Euroclear



**Euroclear**, or the **Euroclear Group**, is a Belgium-based financial market infrastructure group that specialises in the central securities depository (CSD) segment. It traces its origins to the **Euro-clear System** developed in 1968 by Morgan Guaranty (a predecessor of JPMorgan Chase) in Brussels to settle trades on the then developing eurobond market. The service was rebranded Euroclear (without hyphen) in 1990.²⁸² In late 2000, the Euroclear System was transferred to a new entity, Euroclear Bank.

Euroclear Bank, a fully-owned subsidiary of the Euroclear Group, is one of the world's two leading international CSDs, the other being Clearstream Banking SA in nearby Luxembourg. It has been under the spotlight since late February 2022 because it is where most of the reserves of the Bank of Russia are deposited, that were immobilized in the context of international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

Other entities of the Euroclear group include major national CSDs in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK, all acquired by Euroclear in the 2000s.


## History

On 21 July 1967, the Belgian branch of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company launched a pilot securities settlement service for the Brussels eurobond market, the forerunner of the Euroclear System. On 2 December 1968, this was formally marketed as **Euro-clear**, marking the birth of the first ICSD.²⁷⁹ Kidder Peabody had been the first major trading firm to tell the market that it would only deal with firms that cleared through Euroclear. Euroclear's creation provoked a reaction in Luxembourg among firms which competed with Morgan and feared that Morgan could use their settlement data to its trading advantage. This led to the launch of a competitor, Luxembourg-based Cedel, in September 1970.³⁴–³⁵

On 7 July 1972, Euro-clear Clearance System Ltd, a non-resident English company domiciled in Switzerland, was founded by shareholders including over 120 major financial institutions. On 1 December 1972, Euro-clear Clearance System Ltd purchased the Euroclear System from Morgan, which however kept operating it.²⁸⁰ In June 1983, Euroclear introduced computerized securities lending and borrowing. On 21 November 1986, Euroclear's legal construct was complemented with the creation of Euro-clear Clearance System Société Coopérative in Brussels.²⁸²

On 31 December 2000, the system's operation was transferred from Morgan to the newly created Euroclear Bank. On 1 June 2001, Euroclear Clearance System, the parent entity of Euroclear Bank, changed its name to Euroclear plc.²⁸⁶

Euroclear took a 20% stake in the capital of LCH.Clearnet, by then an Anglo-French entity responsible for the clearing of stock trades on Euronext and the London Stock Exchange.

Euroclear then engaged in a series of acquisitions of national CSDs. It acquired France's Sicovam in 2001, then the Netherlands' Necigef and the UK's CRESTCo in 2002. These local CSDs were renamed respectively as Euroclear France, Euroclear Nederland, and Euroclear UK & Ireland. On 1 January 2005, a new Belgian intermediate holding company, Euroclear SA/NV, was created as the owner of Euroclear Bank, the Euroclear national CSDs, and the shared technology and services supplied to them.²⁸⁷ In 2006 Euroclear completed the long-planned acquisition of Belgium's CIK, then in October 2008 purchased the Nordic Central Securities Depository comprising Finland's APK (Suomen Arvopaperikeskus Oy) and Sweden's VPC (Värdepapperscentralen AB), which had merged in 2004; the respective entities were renamed Euroclear Belgium, Euroclear Finland, and Euroclear Sweden. In July 2004, Euroclear also announced it would create a single technical platform known as ESES (for "Euroclear Settlement of Euronext-zone Securities").²⁸⁸ The ESES project was implemented in 2007-2009, bringing together its three CSDs in Belgium, France and the Netherlands, all of which serve securities traded on Euronext.⁴

In May 2013, Euroclear and the US Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) offered access to each other’s vast inventory of collaterals. While the initial offering provided a two-way automatic transfer and retention of collaterals, it was intended to evolve as a single pool of depositories. In April 2014, Euroclear linked its system to the Central Latinoamericana de Valores to open Panama to international investors, thus creating a single pool of liquidity. In February 2015, Mexico opened up its corporate bonds to Euroclear's trading platform, hoping it will facilitate and increase raising funds for its development programs. In 2016, the three ESES CSDs were connected with the Eurosystem's TARGET2-Securities (T2S) securities settlement system.

In 2018 in anticipation of Brexit, the ownership of the Euroclear Group was transferred from Euroclear plc in London to the newly established Euroclear Holding SA/NV in Brussels, with the stated aim of remaining in the European Union.

Euroclear entered the market of funds (including exchange-traded fund and private market assets launching FundsPlace also thanks to the acquisition of MFEX in 2021 and Goji in 2023. In 2021 as another consequence of Brexit, the depository role for Irish securities was transferred from Euroclear UK & Ireland to Euroclear Bank, following which the former CSD was renamed Euroclear UK & International.²²

On 1 October 2024, Euroclear simplified its group structure. Until then, Euroclear Holding SA/NV had owned the Euroclear group entities via several intermediate holding companies: Euroclear AG in Baar, Switzerland, which in turn owned Euroclear Investments SA in Belgium, which in turn owned Euroclear SA/NV in Belgium, which in turn owned Euroclear Bank and Euroclear's national CSDs.¹⁵ As part of the legal restructuring, both Euroclear AG and Euroclear Investments SA were merged into Euroclear Holding SA/NV.


## Operations

Following the 2018 Brexit-related relocation, the Euroclear Group's parent entity is Euroclear Holding SA/NV in Brussels. As of 2023, Euroclear SA/NV operated branches in Amsterdam, London, and Paris, in addition to Euroclear Bank's own branch network.¹⁵

The Euroclear entities settle domestic and international securities transactions, covering bonds, equities, derivatives, and investment funds. Euroclear provides securities services to financial institutions located in more than 90 countries. In addition to Euroclear Bank's role as an international central securities depository (ICSD), Euroclear also operates the CSDs for Belgian, Dutch, Finnish, French, Irish, Swedish, and UK securities. Euroclear also owns EMXCo, the UK's leading provider of investment-fund order routing. Retail investors are able to have direct accounts in local CSDs according to local laws, rules, and procedures.
