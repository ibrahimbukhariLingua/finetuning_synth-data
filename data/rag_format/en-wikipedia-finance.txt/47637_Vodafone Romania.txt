Vodafone Romania


# Vodafone Romania



**Vodafone Romania S.A.** is a Romanian telecommunications operator owned by Vodafone Group Plc. It launched in April 1997 as the first GSM network in Romania.

Before acquisition by Vodafone Group Plc, it was known as **Connex**, after which it was rebranded **Connex-Vodafone** and in April 2006, the Connex name was dropped, the operator being simply known as Vodafone Romania, aligning itself with the global Vodafone brand.

Vodafone Romania is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc, and is the seventh-largest Vodafone subsidiary in the world by number of subscribers. Vodafone became the majority stakeholder after it brought 79% of Mobifon's shares from Canadian company Telesystems International Wireless, which had been the previous majority shareholder. Furthermore, it recently acquired 5% of Mobifon's shares from Canadian Entrepreneur Elani Grobler.

The operator is the main competitor of Orange for the 22.8 million active mobile telephony users in Romania. Connex, the ancestor of Vodafone Romania, held the largest number of subscribers, except the year 2000, until September 2004, when Orange edged ahead.

The motto of Vodafone is *Trăiește fiecare clipă* (rendered in English by the company as Make the most of now, a more accurate translation would be "Live every moment"). Previous mottos were: *Tu faci viitorul* (You create the future) and *Viitorul sună bine* (The future sounds good).


## Details

Subscriber numbers issued in Romania by Vodafone begin with the three-digit prefixes 072, 073 and 079, followed by a unique seven-digit combination. However, not all such numbers necessarily belong to Vodafone subscribers because of the number portability for mobile telephony networks.

On November 2022, the latest auction for the 5G frequencies was completed. The frequencies that Vodafone gained are as follows:

* 10 blocks of 10 MHz on the frequency zone of 3400-3800MHz
* 2 blocks of 5 MHz on the frequency zone of 700MHz

Vodafone was the second highest bidder for the frequencies spending up to 123 million euros. The 5G network became accessible Vodafone Romania subscribers in May 2019.
