# Yao Gang



**Yao Gang** (simplified Chinese: 姚刚; traditional Chinese: 姚剛; pinyin: *Yáo Gāng*; born May 1962) is a Chinese executive who served as one of four vice-chairmen at the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China's top security regulator. He was investigated by the Chinese Communist Party's anti-graft agency in November 2015, after a stock market rout rocked global markets. Yao's downfall marked the widened government crackdown on corruption in the financial industry. Zhang Yujun (张育军), former assistant chairman of the CSRC, was placed under investigation in the end of 2015.

Yao is the highest-ranked securities official from the financial industry under investigation since General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping started his ongoing anti-corruption drive when he took power in the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
