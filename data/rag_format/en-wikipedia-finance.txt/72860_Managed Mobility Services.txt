# Managed Mobility Services



**Managed Mobility Services** (MMS) is a term used by analysts and businesses to describe the outsourcing and managing services that many businesses provide.

Mobility Managed Services includes the IT and process management service needed for a company to acquire, provision and support smartphones, tablets and other field force devices. These services are designed to support devices for corporations are liable and provide a level of control to companies that support them by accessing corporate resources and information.

Managed Mobility Services has existed for some time, but organizations have increasingly shifted responsibility for logistics and management as the environments have become more diverse and updates more frequent. Android fragmentation is sometimes cited as a driver of this growth as is the consumerization of IT, including the adoption of mobile devices by IT departments. This accumulation of influences has been referred to as "The 3 V's": Volume (the number of devices and users involved); Variety (policy changes in order to fit changing standards) and Volatility (high rates of change that could threaten the business).
