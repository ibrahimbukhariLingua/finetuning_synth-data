# Polish & Slavic Federal Credit Union



**Polish & Slavic Federal Credit Union** (**PSFCU**) is a federally insured, federally-chartered, credit union with over 108,000 primary members, serving over 120,000 people. PSFCU has 21 branches in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Pennsylvania. PSFCU is the largest ethnic credit union in the United States.


## History

The Polish & Slavic Federal Credit Union was chartered in 1976 by the founders by Rev. Longin Tolczyk and members of the Polish & Slavic Center. In creating the PSFCU, the founders intended to help immigrants who were turned down by traditional banks. The bank was originally called the **Industrial and Commercial Federal Credit Union**, and was referred to as such in its first charter. In 1979, the credit union adopted its current name.

The first office of the credit union was established on 940 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, adjacent to the Polish & Slavic Center. In 1981, the PSFCU moved its headquarters to 140 Greenpoint Avenue.

In 1987, the first New Jersey branch was opened in Union, followed by rapid expansion over the New York City metropolitan area. In 2007, PSFCU established an ATM at the American Czestochowa in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. In 2010, the PSFCU started its expansion into Illinois with branches in Norridge, Mt. Prospect, Bridgeview and Schaumburg. In January 2019, the Polish & Slavic Federal Credit Union opened its first branch in the state of Pennsylvania, in the town of Stroudsburg.

The Polish & Slavic Federal Credit Union is the largest sponsor of the annual Pulaski Day Parade in New York City.
