## History

In 1963, Charles-Eugène Rochette founded Charles-E. Rochette et associés in La Malbaie, in the Charlevoix region of Quebec. In its early days, the firm mainly offered engineering services. A few years later, Mr. Rochette joined forces with Marc Picard to found Picard, Rochette et associés. In order to ensure its expansion, the company was moved to Quebec City.

With the addition of new associates, Rochette, Lajoie, Grondin, Normand, Rochefort et associés was established in 1965. The 1970s marked the beginning of a growth period for Roche. Three new divisions were created: urban planning, transportation and environment.

In 1977, the firm entered the international market with a first contract in the agricultural sector, in Africa. Over the next few years, Roche opened several offices in Quebec — in Rimouski, on the Côte-Nord and in Thetford Mines — as well as in New Brunswick.

Over time, Roche diversified its services by creating new areas of activity within the company or associating with already established firms. The company became Roche Ltd, Consulting Group in 1984.

In 1991, it built its head office at 3075, chemin des Quatre-Bourgeois, in Quebec City, its present location.

In 1996, Roche adopted a quality management system that meets ISO 9001 standards.

In 1999, the firm signed an agreement with U.S. company The IT Group.

The company declared bankruptcy in 2002 and The Shaw Group acquired most of its stocks.

In 2005, Roche became completely Quebec-owned.
