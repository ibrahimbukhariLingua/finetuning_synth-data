Economic diversity


# Economic diversity



**Economic diversity** or **economic diversification** refers to variations in the economic status or the use of a broad range of economic activities in a region or country. Diversification is used as a strategy to encourage positive economic growth and development. Research shows that more diversified economies are associated with higher levels of gross domestic product.


## Economic Diversification types

1. **Non-connected diversification** – creating a new area. The process is slow, because it is needed to create a whole infrastructure, but the profit would be higher.
2. **Connected diversification** is based on an economical mechanism for expanding the available potential. For business development it means low risks and good margin.
3. **Combined diversification** – more frequently both methods are used together.

## Diversification examples in countries

Good examples of national economy diversification are Chile, Malaysia and Brazil.
