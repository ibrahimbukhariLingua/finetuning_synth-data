# Quantcast



**Quantcast** is an American technology company, founded in 2006, that specializes in AI-driven real-time advertising, audience insights and measurement. It has offices in the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, and Sweden.


## History

Quantcast was launched in 2006. The company was built on the belief that digital advertising requires reliable data to be successful. Initially the primary aim was to gather detailed, real-time insights on audience characteristics across the internet. By placing tags on digital content across the open internet, the firm measures metrics such as audience age and gender makeup, areas of interest and type, length and frequency of their engagement with certain types of content. This private information is made publicly available to be used by marketers and publishers to accurately understand their audience in granular detail.

In 2010, Quantcast's Publisher Program was the first syndicated online traffic measurement service to receive official accreditation from the Media Rating Council (MRC).

In 2013, the company acquired MakeGood Software, an advertising technology startup that simplifies data management and reporting for online advertising campaigns. The technology was subsequently integrated with Quantcast Advertise to enhance the reporting functions available for Quantcast campaigns. This nudged the company closer towards competition in the ad effectiveness category, which includes companies like comScore.

In 2021, Quantcast unveiled the Quantcast Platform, a self-service intelligent audience platform for brands, agencies, and publishers to advertise on the open internet.

In 2021, Quantcast announced the launch of a new educational program, the Quantcast Academy, a self-paced, online training program that provides learning and certification in digital advertising.

In 2021, Quantcast revealed a cookieless solution for the Quantcast Platform.

In August 2023, InMobi acquired Quantcast Choice, Quantcast's consent management solution.
