# Stanley Black & Decker



**Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.**, formerly known as **The Stanley Works**, is a Fortune 500 American manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware, and a provider of security products. Headquartered in the Greater Hartford city of New Britain, Connecticut, Stanley Black & Decker is the result of the merger of The Stanley Works and Black & Decker on March 12, 2010.


## History

The Stanley Works came to existence as a direct result of the 1920 merger of Stanley's Bolt Manufactory, founded by Frederick Trent Stanley in 1843, and the Stanley Rule and Level Company, founded by Frederick's cousin, Henry Stanley, in 1857. DeWalt was acquired in 1960, and sold to Black & Decker.
In March 12, 2010 Black & Decker merged with Stanley Works to become Stanley Black & Decker. It’s a wholly owned subsidiary of that company.

During World War II, Stanley Works received the Army-Navy "E" Award for excellence in war production.

In May 2002, the company considered moving its corporate headquarters to Bermuda, but public and governmental outcry forced management to reconsider the move. By August 2002, the company had decided to maintain its incorporation in the United States.

John F. Lundgren was elected as chairman and chief executive officer in 2004, replacing John Trani, a former protégé of Jack Welch at General Electric.

The Hardware & Home Improvement Group, including the Kwikset, Weiser, Baldwin, National Hardware, Stanley, FANAL, Pfister and EZSET brands, was acquired by Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. on December 17, 2012.

In July 2016, CEO John F. Lundgren stepped down, with President and COO James M. Loree taking over as CEO.

In July 2022, CEO James M. Loree stepped down, with President and CFO Donald Allan, Jr taking over as CEO.
