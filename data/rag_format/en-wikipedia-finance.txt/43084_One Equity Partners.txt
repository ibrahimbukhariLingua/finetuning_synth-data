One Equity Partners was founded in 2001 by Dick Cashin to serve as the private equity investment arm of Bank One. Cashin had previously served as president of Citicorp Venture Capital, the predecessor of Court Square Capital Partners and CVC Capital Partners, where he worked for Bank One's then CEO, Jamie Dimon.

In 2002, former Ford Motor Company CEO Jacques Nasser joined One Equity. He would serve as chairman of Polaroid Corporation. Nasser was involved in 2006, when One Equity was speculated as one of several potential private equity bidders for Jaguar Cars.

In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One. Prior to the merger, JPMorgan had its own in-house private equity investment group, JPMorgan Partners. JPMorgan Partners was significantly larger than One Equity and focused on larger transactions. One Equity was ultimately designated as the exclusive private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase, at which point JPMorgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase and was renamed CCMP Capital. In 2008, when JPMorgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns' private equity platform, Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, One Equity was once again designated the exclusive private equity arm for the combined firm.

In 2014, it was announced that J.P Morgan was to sell off half of its stake in One Equity Partners.

In 2018, One Equity Partners acquires majority share in Ericsson Media Solutions, which is the media business of Ericsson composed of many previous acquisitions, yet a small part of Ericsson. According to Ericsson, deal closing was expected in Q3 2018.


## Debt buyer

In 2006 One Equity Partners purchased Pennsylvania-based NCO Group, "which posted $1.56 billion in revenue last year, making it the largest debt-collection company." According to a J.P. Morgan spokesman, by 2010 the company was "winding down the debt-buying side and will focus on debt collection".
