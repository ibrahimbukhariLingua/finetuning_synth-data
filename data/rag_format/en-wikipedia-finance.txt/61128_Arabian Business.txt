## Controversy

In 2017, the online and print version of the magazine was suspended for a month in the UAE by Dubai authorities over false news allegations after it published a report stating that courts in Dubai were in the process of liquidating dozens of failed real estate projects. As the article was published during the Qatar diplomatic crisis, the report was picked up by publications in Qatar, attracting the ire of Emirati authorities. The magazine soon deleted the online article and posted an apology online stating that the piece was related to projects dating from 2010 that are now outdated.
