## History

In the 1970s, Gammon Construction redeveloped the Victoria Barracks. At the same year, Hongkong Land acquired Gammon Construction. It was completed at 1975.

In the 1980s, HSBC set up a vault on the ground floor of the building before the HSBC Building was completed. In the same year, it was renamed as Carrian House after a HKD$998 million purchase by the Carrian Group. Within two years, the property price plummeted due to political uncertainty, and the purchase was seen as a "fraud," with Carrian Group being liquidated by the court. The case was resolved in the Supreme Court in 1997.

It was sold in layers, and purchased and renamed by Bank of America. In the early 2000s, Bank of America's Hong Kong office moved its operations to Hong Kong International Finance Centre Tower 2 and Kowloon Trade Centre,ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠʸ retaining only the naming rights and external advertising rights of Bank of America.
