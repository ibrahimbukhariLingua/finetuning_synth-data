## Initiatives


### Solar Energy Awareness Initiative

In March 2017, WiSolar initiated the "Solar Scholar" campaign to promote awareness of renewable energy in South Africa. The campaign involved visiting educational institutions across the country to educate staff and students on the benefits of clean energy in homes.To further expand this initiative, WiSolar developed an online platform that allowed educational institutions and students to register and submit ideas on solar energy.


### Prepaid Solar Electricity Roll-Out

In July 2019, WiSolar proposed to raise $40M in debt and equity to accelerate the roll-out of prepaid solar electricity in South Africa and Nigeria. The company aimed to eliminate environmentally polluting fuel generators, and promote renewable energy in Nigeria with specific focus on areas such as Lagos, Abuja, Enugu, Abia, Imo, Anambra, Ogun, Oyo, Ondo, and Rivers states in Nigeria. In 2022, WiSolar launched a mobile application known as WiGo. This mobile application enables users to independently purchase prepaid solar electricity for their homes.


### Upskilling Program and Partnership

In November 2019, WiSolar announced plans to upskill the electrical engineering graduates of its solar academy, enhancing its internal capabilities in solar electricity. Additionally, in March 2020, the company forged a partnership with LG to incorporate high-efficiency black photovoltaic panels, enabling LG to become a provider of solar panels for WiSolar and its customers.


### Solar Financing for Mainstream Adoption

As part of its efforts to make solar electricity more mainstream in South Africa, WiSolar established the Gateway Office in Bronkhorstspruit. In June 2020, the company began offering solar financing solutions to facilitate broader adoption of solar energy. In 2022, WiSolar commenced the deployment of their prepaid solar electricity to homes in residential estates within South Africa and Nigeria, after a period of delays.
