Energy in Ohio


# Energy in Ohio



The energy sector of Ohio consists of thousands of companies and cities representing the oil, natural gas, coal, solar, wind energy, fuel cell, biofuel, geothermal, hydroelectric, and other related industries. Oil and natural gas accounts for $3.1 billion annually in sales while ethanol generates $750 million. Toledo is a national hub in solar cell manufacturing, and the state has significant production of fuel cells. In 2008, the state led the country in alternative energy manufacturing according to Site Selection Magazine, while the natural gas industry has experienced growth due to the expansion of shale gas.

Several notable energy companies are headquartered in Ohio, including American Electric Power, Columbia Gas of Ohio, DPL Inc., Marathon Petroleum Company, American Municipal Power, Inc., Cleveland-Cliffs, Murray Energy, FirstEnergy, Oxford Resource Partners LP, AB Resources, American Hydrogen Corporation, and IGS Energy. Rolls-Royce North America's Energy Systems Inc. is headquartered in Mt. Vernon, specializing in gas compression, power generation, and pipeline technologies. Ultra Premium Oilfield Services and V&M Star Steel operate steel production facilities in the state, which cater to energy exploration.

Ohio consumed 160.176 TWh of electricity in 2005, fourth among U.S. states, and has a storied history in the sector, including the first offshore oil drilling platform in the world, and a modern, renewable energy economy along with the traditional nuclear, oil, coal, and gas industries.

Ohio has been ranked last in addressing environmental issues and alternative energy consumption and 47th in carbon footprint. The modern American environmental movement concerning legislation and awareness can largely be traced back to the Cuyahoga River fire of June 22, 1969.


## Early innovation

Thomas Edison, a native of Milan, is widely regarded as a father of the modern industrialized world and the originator of mass-energy generation and distribution concepts, as well as the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Another Ohio native, Charles F. Brush is said to have invented the first electric dynamo, resulting in the present-day United Kingdom–based Brush Electrical Machines. Arthur Compton, of Wooster, invented the fluorescent light tube and was a pioneer in the study of atomic energy.


## Oil and natural gas

The Ohio oil and natural gas industries employ 14,400 citizens, resulting in $730 million in wages. The industries paid $202 million in royalties to landowners, and $84 million in free energy. The state's oil and natural gas industry continues to grow, having topped the $1 billion mark in market value production for four consecutive years, including $1.35 billion in 2008. This has only been accomplished five times in state history. The oil and gas industry contributed $1.5 billion to the gross state product in 2008, and $3.1 billion in sales.

Ohio was one of the original modern-energy states in the world starting in the 19th century and has a storied history. The first discovery of oil from a drilled well and first offshore oil rig placed in world history occurred in Ohio in 1814 in Noble County, and 1891 at Grand Lake St. Marys. Ohio was the country's lead producer of oil between 1895 and 1903, until technology allowed further developments throughout the nation. Since that first well drilled in 1814 by Silas Thora and Robert McKee in Noble County, the state has drilled 273,000 wells, ranking it fourth nationally behind Texas, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania historically.

At peak production, the state produced 24,000,000 barrels (3,800,000 m³) of oil in 1896. They produced the world's first billionaire, John D. Rockefeller, as a result. Standard Oil was first headquartered in Cleveland, beginning in 1870. The state has produced 1,120,000,000 barrels (178,000,000 m³) since 1860.

In 2007, the state produced 5,455,000 barrels (867,300 m³) of crude, and increased production to 5,554,000 barrels (883,000 m³) in 2008, ranking #17 in the country. The state is fourth in the country in total wells drilled, including natural gas, only trailing Texas, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania, and having drilled 1,048 new wells in 2008. Offshore oil drilling in Lake Erie first occurred in 1913, and the lake is home to oil reserves.

Ohio has the second largest oil refining capacity in the Midwest. Toledo is home to facilities operated by PBF Energy and BP, totaling over 300,000 BPD capacity. The BP facility is undergoing a $400 million renovation and is expected to receive nearly exclusive supplies from a $2.5 billion oilsands project in Alberta by 2011. Toledo is also a target destination for supplies coming from the Bakken Oil Fields.

Natural gas was discovered in Clinton County in 1887. In 2008, the state produced 85 billion cubic feet of natural gas, which nearly 100% of the production stayed in the state, enough to heat 1 million homes. The Rockies Express Pipeline was recently completed, connecting the eastern part of Ohio with natural gas production facilities in Colorado. 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves are estimated to be in Ohio's portion of Lake Erie alone.

The Marathon Petroleum Company and IGS Energy are major oil and natural gas companies headquartered in the state, with Speedway, headquartered in Enon, serving as a gasoline distributor of Marathon. Natural gas supplier Delta Energy completed the construction of its new headquarters in Dublin in the summer of 2011.


### Devonian Shales

In 1951, the process of hydraulic fracturing was used in Ohio to extract oil and gas. Beneath Ohio rests part of the Devonian Shales, which contain large quantities of natural gas and oil reserves, and is one of the world's largest concentration of organic carbon.

Part of the Devonian Shale is the Marcellus Shale, which alone is estimated to hold between 168 trillion and 516 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Recent technological advances have made the recovery of these reserves possible, and the state has experienced a boom in drilling. It is estimated that 423 billion barrels (67.3×10~~^~~⁹ m³) of oil are present in the Devonian-Mississippi Shale, with 98% of the near-surface mineable resources located in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee.


#### Great Shale Gas Rush

By March 2010, The Intelligencer, based in neighboring Wheeling, West Virginia, had declared that a "gas rush" was occurring with the Marcellus Shale in the area and that property was "hot". May saw the $4.7 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell of East Resources's drilling property in neighboring states.

Intense leasing activity was reported in eastern Ohio in September, including Gastar Exploration and South Korea–based Atinum Partners citing Ohio acreage in a $70 million deal. Pennsylvania-based CONSOL Energy began drilling Belmont County, while Anschutz Exploration Corporation announced that month it had sold 500,000 acres (2,000 km²) of its oil and natural gas fields, including in Ohio, for $3 billion.

By October, *National Geographic* had officially coined the boom as the "Great Shale Gas Rush", with 70 energy companies prospecting New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio with plans to drill 3,500 well a year over the next decade with the potential of 200,000 new employment positions.

In August 2011, Chesapeake Energy announced it would open a field office in Canton. In September 2011, Hess Corporation announced a $750 million play in the state's Utica Shale.


##### Infrastructure

V&M Star Steel, a subsidiary of France-based Vallourec, announced plans to construct a $650 million plant in Youngstown in February 2010 because of the drilling boom, expanding existing operations in the state, which broke ground in June of that year. Later in February, Russia-based TMK IPSCO opened a production facility in Brookfield through a subsidiary, Ultra Premium Oilfield Services, with the Marcellus Shale exploration boom cited as the reason. By June 2010, TMK IPSCO had cited increasing sales commensurate with the "boom".

In July 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor announced a $5 million grant to train workers for Marcellus shale drilling, including laborers in Ohio. In August of that year, Kinder Morgan announced plans to construct a 230-240 mile-long underground pipeline, which would transport recovered natural gas supplies in Western Pennsylvania from West Virginia to Toledo, ultimately connecting with existing pipelines in Michigan and Southern Ontario. In September, Warren's water treatment facility announced plans to become the first in the state to accept waste water from shale drilling, while at the 2010 Marcellus Summit in State College, Pennsylvania, state officials announced they were working with local officials on bonding issues for new infrastructure.

Laurel Mountain Midstream announced in October plans to expand its pipeline collection system covering wells in Ohio, and later that month Texas-based El Paso Midstream Group and Spectra Energy signed a memorandum of understanding to construct their Marcellus Ethane Pipeline System to connect existing Ohio and Pennsylvania pipelines with Gulf Coast destinations. Later that month U.S. Steel announced their Lorain facility would begin work to meet the demands of drilling activities.


##### Environmental concerns

In October 2010, it was reported that drilling in the shale was causing uranium deposits to be released. Reuters reports that fracking has been linked to earthquakes in Ohio. In 2011, there were 11 earthquakes that took place in the area, where earthquakes were unknown prior to commencement of gas extraction.

On October 2, 2013, a series of six earthquakes were located south of Clendening Lake in Harrison County, Ohio, and included two Mw 2.0 events. This series was followed by four more events with Mw 1.7–2.2 from 3 to 19 October. There were no felt reports for any of these earthquakes. According to historical catalogs, this series of earthquakes is the first known seismic occurrence in the region. Based on the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) map of oil and gas wells in the area, at least seven horizontal wells had undergone hydraulic fracturing near and around Clendening Lake from February to October 2013. Several corroborating evidences show that it is most probable that hydraulic fracturing on the wells induced the 2013 Harrison earthquake sequence.


## Coal

Ohio is ranked #7 in the country in overall coal reserves, with 23 billion short tons, 11 billion of which is recoverable. In 2008, the state mined 26 million short tons of coal, ranking #11 in the country in production.

The Baard Project, to be located in Wellsville and led by Washington-based Baard Energy, in October 2010 announced it will begin construction on a facility to liquify coal into jet and diesel fuel after receiving $2.5 billion for the first phase of the $6 billion project.

The state has also become a target for a similar synthetic oil operation by Pennsylvania-based CoalStar Industries.


## Renewable

Ohio is part of the emerging "Green Belt" in the United States, as companies flock to the industrial Midwest and Northeast to take advantage of the proximity to the infrastructure, resources, and skilled labor available. Through 2007, Ohio ranked #4 in the country for green economic growth, according to the Pew Charitable Trust. In 2008, Site Selection magazine ranked Ohio #1 in the nation in alternative energy manufacturing, with 135 projects. In 2006, renewable energy revenues in Ohio were $775 million, creating 6,615 jobs.

In 2008, the Ohio legislature unanimously passed, and Governor Ted Strickland signed into law, Senate Bill 221 requiring 12.5% of Ohio's energy be generated from renewable sources by 2025. This built on initiatives from the previous administration of Bob Taft, who led with an "Energy Action Plan" and placed mandates on ethanol and renewable energy use for the state government, while providing incentives for production and consumption to the private market. However, in 2019, Republicans passed Ohio House Bill 6 which reduced the renewable portfolio standard to 8.5% by 2026. Electric utility company FirstEnergy bribed Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives Larry Householder with $60 million in support for Republican candidates in exchange for the bill, which also heavily subsidized coal-fired power plants and nuclear plants.


### Solar

In 2006, revenue created from geothermal totalled $112 million, creating 1,270 jobs. The largest family-owned geothermal drilling company and one of the largest companies for such in the United States, Jackson Geothermal, is headquartered in Mansfield.


### Hydroelectric

Columbus is home to a national leader in hydroelectric power development, American Municipal Power, Inc. They currently have five plants under development along the Ohio River, including the 84 MW Cannelton project, 105 MW Meldhahl project, 48 MW Robert C. Bird project, 72 MW Smithland project, and 35 MW Willow Island project. They also operate the existing Belleville Hydroelectric Plant. Other notable hydroelectric plants and operations include Stockport Mill Country Inn and the O'Shaughnessy Dam.


## Nuclear

Ohio is home to two nuclear power plants, the Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station and Perry Nuclear Generating Station. A third is planned for construction in Piketon, at a cost of $10 billion and with promise of 3000 construction jobs. The project is being led by Duke Energy.

Piketon is already home to the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a former uranium enrichment plant built in 1954 and used for energy and weaponry purposes. It ceased in 2001 to perform its main functions, but carried on with relatively small tasks, until the United States Enrichment Corporation, which owns the facility, constructed the American Centrifuge Demonstration Facility at the site. Construction also has begun on the American Centrifuge Plant, which was expected to reach commercial capacity in 2010, but because of lack of funding, has been relegated to research tasks.

France-based Areva began operational testing of their new facility in Portsmouth, called the DUF₆ project, in 2010, which will convert 700,000 metric tons of depleted uranium hexafluoride into uranium oxide. It became fully operational later that year in September.

Ohio has an above average concentration of uranium in southern Ohio, as well as in the Ohio shale located in the western and central part of the state.


## Modern environment movement

Ohio historically has suffered environmental damage from its industrial and energy base. It has been ranked last in addressing environmental issues and alternative energy consumption and 47th in carbon footprint.

The modern American environmental movement concerning legislation and awareness, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Clean Water Act, can largely be traced back to the Cuyahoga River fire of June 22, 1969. One of the leading causes of the fire was oil discharged into the river by nearby refineries. The fire also inspired the Randy Newman song "Burn On".
