## Career

Mazaheri was the governor of the Central Bank of Iran from September 2007 to September 2008. He was the shortest serving governor of Central Bank since its establishment.

He was a candidate in the 2013 presidential election. His nomination was rejected.


### Controversy

In January 2013, Mazaheri was interrogated at Düsseldorf Airport by German police due to not informing the authorities in advance that he carried a 300 million Venezuelan bolívar cheque (nearly $70 million).

It was later noted that the cheque belonged to an Iranian building company to cover its expenses while building public housing in Venezuela and Mazaheri was bringing the check for the company.
