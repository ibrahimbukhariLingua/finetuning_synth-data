## Products


### Talkie

MiniMax's first product was Glow which was launched in October 2022. The app allowed users to create virtual characters, give them background stories and then chat with them about various topics. Only four months after launch, the app had over 5 million users. Due to filing issues, Glow was terminated in March 2023.

Glow was relaunched under two new brands: Talkie, launched for international markets in June 2023, and Xing Ye (星野), introduced in September 2023 for the Chinese market.

Talkie was profiled *The Wall Street Journal* in July 2024. For June 2024 Talkie ranked fifth among the most-downloaded free entertainment apps in the U.S. More than half of Talkie’s 11 million monthly active users were in the U.S. Other popular markets included Philippines, the U.K. and Canada. Talkie offered AI-generated conversations with people such as Donald Trump, Taylor Swift, Elon Musk and LeBron James.

In March 2024, MiniMax launched Hailuo AI, a multimodal large language model consumer platform that provides AI text and music-generating features.

In September 2024, MiniMax launched video-01, a text-to-video model under Hailuo AI. A review by Tom's Guide stated it roughly equivalent to Luma Labs Dream Machine but not as good as Runway Gen-3.

In December 2024, *Broadcast* reported that Hailuo AI can reproduce the logos of British television channels Channel 4, Channel 5, and ITV in its AI-generated videos.
