The **International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation** or **IFRS Foundation** (sometimes **IFRSF**) is a nonprofit organization that sets corporate reporting standards for the capital markets globally. Its main objectives include the development and promotion of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS Standards), through the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for accounting standards and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) for sustainability-related disclosure standards.

The IFRS Foundation states that its mission is to develop IFRS Standards that bring transparency, accountability and efficiency to capital markets around the world, and that their work serves the public interest by fostering trust, growth and long-term financial stability in the global economy.

The Foundation is governed by a group of 22 trustees, themselves under the oversight of a "Monitoring Board" of public authorities.


## Background

In 2001, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC, established 1973) reformed itself under a new dual structure consisting mainly of an independent standard-setting body, the International Accounting Standards Board, and a foundation that appoints and funds the IASB, initially named the IASC Foundation. The IASB assumed accounting standard-setting responsibilities from the IASC on 1 March 2001. The IASC Foundation changed its name to IFRS Foundation on 1 July 2010.

During the first twenty years of activity, the IASB was the IFRS Foundation's dominant standard-setting body. In 2021, the IFRS Foundation created a second standard-setting board, the International Sustainability Standards Board.


## Activities

**IFRS Accounting**

The IASB is an independent group of experts with an appropriate mix of recent practical experience and broad geographical diversity, as required by the IFRS Foundation *Constitution*.

IASB members are responsible for the development and publication of IFRS Accounting Standards, including the *IFRS for SMEs* Accounting Standard. The IASB works with the IFRS Interpretations Committee to support consistent application of the Standards.

IFRS Accounting Standards are required for use by more than 140 jurisdictions. The IASB’s work includes continually developing and improving the Standards.

**IFRS Sustainability**

Responding to the need for consistent and comparable sustainability information to inform economic and investment decisions, in 2021 the IFRS Foundation created the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) which operates alongside the IASB. The ISSB develops IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, designed to deliver a truly global baseline of sustainability disclosures to inform capital markets.

The ISSB builds on the work of market-led investor-focused reporting initiatives, including the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Value Reporting Foundation’s Integrated Reporting Framework and industry-based SASB Standards.

The ISSB issued its inaugural Standards, IFRS S1 *General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information* and IFRS S2 *Climate-related Disclosures*, in 2023. Jurisdictions around the world are determining how to adopt or use the Standards.

**IFRS digital taxonomies**

The IFRS digital taxonomies facilitate the reporting of information prepared in accordance with IFRS Standards in a computer-readable, structured data format. They consist of elements that can be used to tag information in financial reports prepared using IFRS Standards. Tagging makes information computer-readable and, therefore, more accessible to investors and other users of electronic company financial reports. The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is used to represent and deliver IFRS Taxonomy content. The IFRS digital taxonomies include the IFRS Accounting Taxonomy, the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Taxonomy and the SASB Standards Taxonomy.
