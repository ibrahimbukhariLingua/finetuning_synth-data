## Synopsis

*Investment* tells the story of a typical ‘upwardly mobile’ couple: Aashish, an ambitious young man, about to change his job to join an American firm, and his wife Prachi, who is encouraging and eager to move into a higher class of society. (This couple is indicative of the young people in urban areas thriving to achieve more, albeit at cost of social values). The couple has a twelve-year-old son, Sohel, who is being brought up with much care and with a dream of raising a successful Politician of the Future, a field which they believe is promising due to its lucrative opportunities of growth, power and finance.

Sohel is a rather spoilt & self-centered brat who believes and follows his father's motto of ‘always getting what he wants’. He sends a love note to his classmate Deepa Gangan who hails from a totally different social strata and her father informs Ashish and Prachi to keep their son at bay. Deepa is found missing and Sohel claims that he is unaware of her whereabouts. Deepa’s dead body is found by the police the next day. From this point forward in the film the issues of morality of different characters comes to the fore with the resolution of the crime while testing and making a remark on the materialistic point of view with which today's generation is approaching moral
values.

The aftermath represents the slow but sure criminalization accompanied by the total lack of regret of the educated young middle-class, with subsequent disregard for moral values, and thus forms the terribly realistic & therefore shocking climax of the film.

### Development

The origin of the film came about in the year 2003 when the story was published, as a Novella, in one of the most prestigious & progressive magazines in the State with a large subscriber base. The story, when published received enormous positive response due to the unusually realistic & uncompromising treatment that made the reader identify with it. Many prominent theatre and Film personalities approached the Writer, Ratnakar Matkari, for rights to convert the story into a film, but he refused as he himself wanted to make the film based on the story. The story was adapted for the film by 2006 when the screenplay was ready. While researching the most appropriate way of making this film Ratnakar Matkari and Associate Director Ganesh Matkari met Amol Gole, who is considered as one of the recent prominent discovery in the Digital media and has to his credit critically acclaimed films like Stanley Ka Dabba, Gajar, Ha Bharat Maza.
