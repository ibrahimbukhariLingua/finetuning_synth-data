**Tomorrow.io** (formerly **ClimaCell**; legally known as **The Tomorrow Companies Inc.**) is an American weather technology company. It provides real-time weather forecasting services and APIs.


## History

The company was founded in 2016 as ClimaCell to develop a real-time weather forecasting service based on cellular and IoT monitoring systems.

In February 2021, Tomorrow.io announced Operation Tomorrow Space. The company hoped to broaden its business model by launching proprietary radar satellites to improve its forecasting abilities. In March of that year, it announced that it had raised $77 million in a series D round of funding.


## Technology

Tomorrow.io's primary goal was to use wireless communication infrastructure and IoT devices to collect real-time weather data. The company aimed to report conditions closer to the ground than satellite and higher resolution than Doppler weather radar techniques.

The information includes measurements on temperature, wind and precipitation data. After two years of development, Tomorrow.io's Weather Intelligence Platform (formerly Hypercast) was publicly launched in April 2017.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The system operates in the Ka band to detect precipitation and ocean surface characteristics. The company plans to launch 20 satellites with a combination of active radar and passive microwave sensors.
