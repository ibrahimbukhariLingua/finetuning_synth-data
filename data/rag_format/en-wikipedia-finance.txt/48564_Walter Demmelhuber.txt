# Walter Demmelhuber



**Walter Demmelhuber** (born 1969 in Trostberg, Germany) is a German economist.


## Education and career

Demmelhuber grew up on a large dairy farm. After graduating from high school, he pursued vocational training as an industrial mechanic with the aim of taking over his parents' farm; but then studied for a bachelor's degree at the University of Essex, a master's degree at the Universidad de Alicante and received his doctorate in 2003. rer. pol. at Osnabrück University.

The basis of his dissertation is the obstacles faced by students, researchers and teachers in the European Union, which shed light on the hindrance to the recognition of qualifications and employment, particularly as civil servants, in other EU countries. In particular, further research into limiting the competence of universities to independently determine language entry criteria has led to it being made uniformly easier for students to start studying abroad with a language reference framework of B1/B2.

Since 2012 he has been a guest professor at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität in Erlangen-Nuremberg and since 2016 he is part of the advisory board of the Faculty of Economics.

He is Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Hosokawa Alpine AG and Board of Directors of the stockmarket listed FRIWO AG.
