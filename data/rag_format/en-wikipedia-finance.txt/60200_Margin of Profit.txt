## Reception

R Jarnor reviewed *Margin of Profit* for *White Dwarf* #65, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that "It could well be used as an introduction to a merchant campaign, since although it is based around a merchant deal, no real merchant orientated decisions have to be taken by the players."

Bob Mosley III reviewed *Margin of Profit* in *Space Gamer* No. 75. Mosley commented that "*Margin of Profit* is an exceptional module. The main plot is clear and defined, and the subplots and distractions for the players are detailed as well. Using the material supplies in this module, and extensive merchant campaign can be started with this mission on Cordian."
