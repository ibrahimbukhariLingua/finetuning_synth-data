Petroleum (Production) Act (Northern Ireland) 1964


# Petroleum (Production) Act (Northern Ireland) 1964



The **Petroleum (Production) Act (Northern Ireland) 1964** (c. 28 (N.I.)) is an Act of the Parliament of Northern Ireland which vested in the Northern Ireland **Ministry of Commerce** the property in undeveloped petroleum. It also made provision for searching for and producing petroleum.


## Background

Earlier legislation such as the Land Purchases Acts had vested land, mines and mineral rights in the Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance, see for example the Minerals (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 (1959 c. 17). By the early 1960s the commercial development of the oil and gas industry was a realistic prospect as seen in other parts of the UK. The responsibility for issuing exploration and production licences, and the holding of mineral rights was seen to be more appropriately vested in the Ministry of Commerce. This legislation enacted these requirements.
