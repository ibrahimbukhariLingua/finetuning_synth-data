### Mobile top-up money transfer

Rebtel’s tech platform supports money transfer in the form of mobile top-up, in which users can transfer credit to others by mobile phone a practice common in parts of the world with unreliable or nonexistent financial systems. In early 2018, the company launched Nauta for the Cuban community.


### Activist program (Rebtel Activista)

Rebtel’s Activist program was launched in 2016 as a pilot in Miami, Florida, enabling anyone to sign up to become a Rebtel reseller through the independent Activist app. Since the launch, the Activist program has expanded to Houston, Texas. Over 10,000 people have joined the program.ᵃˢ ᵒᶠ?


### *Beyond Borders* magazine

In late 2017, Rebtel launched and published its first edition of *Beyond Borders*, an online magazine and community that curates and creates content and journalism for international migrants and immigrants.


### SDK

Rebtel launched a software development kit (SDK) in September 2012, allowing independent developers to integrate voice calling and instant messaging in their apps. The Rebtel SDK currently supports app-to-app communication over data—such as 3G or Wi-Fi—and uses the same backend as Rebtel’s own apps. Developers can decide how to handle aspects of the user experience, such as user management, ringtones, and calling screens.


### Sendly

In December 2013, Rebtel launched Sendly, a new app that lets users top up the prepaid mobile phones of friends and family abroad.


## History

Hjalmar Winbladh co-founded and spent seven years as president and CEO of Sendit AB, taking the firm public before it was acquired by Microsoft for US$127.5 million in 1999. Rebtel appointed Andreas Bernström, formerly COO of TradeDoubler, as CEO in September 2009. In late 2015, Bernström left the company and was succeeded by Magnus Larsson. In 2014, a group of former executives from Tele2—a telecommunications company owned by Swedish investment company Kinnevik—approached the company’s owners with a proposal for a shift in strategy.

Following a brand overhaul, a product strategy shift to a subscription model and flat-rate pricing, and the launch of an independent work program (Activist), the company experienced a turnaround: it grew 40% after one year and reached a revenue of $95 million in 2017. CEO Magnus Larsson told Thomson Reuters in 2017 that he had no plans to make the company public.

In 2020, Rebtel posted revenue above $150 million and seemed on track to exceed $200 million in 2021, mostly boosted by communication needs during COVID-19 lockdowns. In 2021, Rebtel split with Majority, a fintech with the aim of solving banking needs for immigrants. Rebtel then took on new management and has since positioned itself as a marketplace for the global immigrant population's cross-border communication and remittance needs.
