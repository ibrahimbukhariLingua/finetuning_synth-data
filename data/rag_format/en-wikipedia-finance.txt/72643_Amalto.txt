It serves the oil & gas, industrial, environmental and enterprise markets.

Amalto Technologies is a private company owned by its management, employees and venture capitalists. It has offices in the US (Houston), France (Paris) and Canada (Calgary).


## History

The company was founded in 2005 in Paris by four individuals who had either launched e-procurement projects as employees of oil and gas companies, or worked as suppliers to these companies and other operators.

In 2008, Chevron selected Amalto's *b2een* solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ to enable electronic transactions with its suppliers.

In June 2009, Amalto Technologies closed a class A share sale to Succès Europe, a French angel investor holding.

Amalto developed a master data management (MDM) product *Xtentis* by 2008. It was based on a native XML database and leveraged open-source technology, such as eXist XML server and JBoss.

In September 2009, Xtentis was acquired by Talend, a French open source software vendor. In January 2010, the system was released as an open source product under name *Talend MDM* (delivered as a free open source version *Talend Open Studio for MDM* and subscription-based *Talend Platform for MDM*). It became the first open source MDM solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ on the market.

In February 2011, the company launched *Amalto e-Business Cloud*, a B2B electronic document exchange solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for trading partner collaboration.

On 6 April 2021, Sidetrade announced the acquisition of Almato for $16m.


## Products and services

Amalto's main offering is the *e-Business Cloud*, a private-cloud fully-managed solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ supporting electronic B2B transactions with trading partners (clients, suppliers, logistics providers,…) and automating business processes such as Order-to-Cash.


## Clients

Amalto provides services to such corporations as Chevron, GE Grid Solutions, Suez, Thales Group, Iron Mountain, Clean Harbors, National Oilwell Varco (NOV). As of 2011, over 20% of electronic invoices sent to Chevron by its suppliers were dispatched using software of Amalto.

Amalto focuses on "mid tier" suppliers, which send hundreds of invoices per year, which is a lot of manual work, but not enough for them to justify investing in more expensive electronic data interchange (EDI) systems for handling purchases. Amalto worked with such suppliers as Mullen Group, Dixie Electric, Complete Production Services, Stallion Oilfield Holdings and others.


## Recognition

Amalto was rated by Gartner to be one of the three Cool Vendors in Platform and Integration Middleware in 2009.
