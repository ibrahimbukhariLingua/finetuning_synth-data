# Lasco Jamaica



***LASCO Affiliated Companie*** (formerly LASCO Group of Companies) is a Jamaican holding company with operations in food products, financial services and distribution.


## History

In 2004, the company started a factory in Plymouth, England to manufacture products for the West Indian community in the United Kingdom that they withdrew within two years.

After lengthy litigation, Chin's ex-wife Audrey, a chartered accountant, was awarded 50% shares in the company. The marriage ended in 1994, but the ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was not issued until October 1, 2007.

In 2006, Lasco, which sells imported milk powder in Jamaica, unsuccessfully opposed the Jamaican Government's proposal to create a Dairy Development Board.

Until 2008 they were the Official Distributors for Johnson & Johnson products in Jamaica.
