## How it works

Fonix's service works by charging digital payments to the mobile phone bill, either via Carrier Billing or SMS Billing. Fonix also offers messaging solutions.


### Carrier billing

APIs are used to charge users to their phone bills through desktop, mobile or apps. Fonix's Carrier Billing services can be used for ticketing (e.g. parking tickets and cinema tickets), content (e.g. paying for film or magazines) and cash deposits.


### SMS billing

Fonix's API charges customers to their phone bills via SMS. This means that customers can purchase services or make charitable donations and are charged by sending the text message. The service is most commonly used for digital purchases, such as content, donations, voting, competitions and polls.


### Messaging

Fonix's messaging services have the capability to send and receive SMS online, via an API or via SMPP. RCS messaging can be used to send richer message content.
