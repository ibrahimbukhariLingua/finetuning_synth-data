The **roupie** or **rupee** was the currency of French India. It was equal to the Indian rupee issued by the Indian government. One rupee was worth 2.40 *francs-or*. Until 1871 it was issued as coins with the roupie divided into 8 *fanons*, each of 3 *doudous* or 20 *cash*. From 1891, banknotes were issued by the Banque de l'Indochine, which circulated alongside coins issued by British India.
