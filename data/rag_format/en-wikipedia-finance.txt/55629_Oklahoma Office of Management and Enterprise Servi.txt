## Overview


### History

The **Office of State Finance** was created in 1947 by Governor of Oklahoma Robert S. Kerr to replace the **State Budget Office**.

In April 2010, Governor Brad Henry appointed the Oklahoma's first chief information officer following legislation passed in the last session of 2009 modernizing Oklahoma's state government information technology system. Part of the CIO's responsibilities is to identify synergies possible through the reduction of duplicate systems and centralizing IT infrastructure.

The Office of State Finance was significantly reformed in 2011 when Governor Mary Fallin signed the Government Administrative Process Consolidation and Reorganization Reform Act of 2011. Pursuant to that Act, several agencies were consolidated into OSF, including the Oklahoma Department of Central Services, the Oklahoma Office of Personnel Management, the Oklahoma State Employees Benefits Council, and the Oklahoma State and Education Employees Group Insurance Board. All the powers and duties of those agencies were vested in the director of OSF and the individual agencies became subsidiary divisions of the OSF, which was renamed the **Office of Management and Enterprise Services**.
