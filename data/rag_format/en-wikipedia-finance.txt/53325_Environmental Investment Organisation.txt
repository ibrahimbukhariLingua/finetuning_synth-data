Environmental Investment Organisation


# Environmental Investment Organisation



The **Environmental Investment Organisation** (**EIO**) is a UK-based not-for-profit body dedicated to researching, proposing and implementing solutions to climate change. It has developed the *Environmental Tracking* (ET) concept, rebranded by ET Index Research in 2016 to Engaged Tracking, into two separate components known as the ET Carbon Rankings and the ET Index Series. The ET Carbon Rankings rate companies based on their greenhouse gas emissions intensity and transparency. The ET Low Carbon & Fossil Free Index Series, which are based on the rankings, provide investors with a tool to incentivise companies to lower emissions while reducing their exposure to potential future carbon 'price shocks'.


## Origins

The EIO was set up as in 1996 by London School of Economics alumnus, Michael Gill, as a parallel body to the LSE Environmental Initiatives Network (EIN). Michael Gill co-founded the LSE EIN with Janos Abel and was the EIN's first elected chairman stepping down in 2003 to become the vice-chairman.,
