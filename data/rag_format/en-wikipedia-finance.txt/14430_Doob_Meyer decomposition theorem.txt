Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem


# Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem



The **Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem** is a theorem in stochastic calculus stating the conditions under which a submartingale may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of a martingale and an increasing predictable process. It is named for Joseph L. Doob and Paul-André Meyer.


## History

In 1953, Doob published the Doob decomposition theorem which gives a unique decomposition for certain discrete time martingales. He conjectured a continuous time version of the theorem and in two publications in 1962 and 1963 Paul-André Meyer proved such a theorem, which became known as the Doob-Meyer decomposition. In honor of Doob, Meyer used the term "class D" to refer to the class of supermartingales for which his unique decomposition theorem applied.


## Class D supermartingales

A càdlàg supermartingale {\displaystyle Z} is of Class D if {\displaystyle Z\_{0}=0} and the collection

is uniformly integrable.


## The theorem

Let {\displaystyle Z} be a cadlag supermartingale of class D. Then there exists a unique, non-decreasing, predictable process {\displaystyle A} with {\displaystyle A\_{0}=0} such that {\displaystyle M\_{t}=Z\_{t}+A\_{t}} is a uniformly integrable martingale.
