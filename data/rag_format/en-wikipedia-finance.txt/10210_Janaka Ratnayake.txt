He was instrumental in leading an expansion strategy aimed at improving the banks strength within diverse sectors of the banking and finance industry.

In order to further strengthen the financial stability of the banking sector, MBSL acquired the Ceylinco Savings Bank (now MBSL Savings Bank) and ABC Insurance Company (now MBSL Insurance) with an infusion of capital.

Rallying many exporters together, he successfully managed to attract over 1000 delegates including several trade and commerce ministers from Israel, India, Pakistan and the Maldives to name a few
With Sri Lanka still looking for a second branded export after Ceylon Tea, the EDB ensured that Sri Lanka secured a head-start with Ceylon Cinnamon which was registered and patented in all economically strategic locations worldwide as "Pure Ceylon Cinnamon" Along with the EDB, Janaka Ratnayake was tasked with serving on the board the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Authority.
