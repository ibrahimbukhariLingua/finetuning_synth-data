## History

The Lemos family is a prominent Greek ship-owning family which has been involved in shipping since the 18th century. From 1860 to 1914 the family owned 52 vessels. Whilst their first vessels were general cargo, the family expanded their interests over the years into bulk carriers and tankers.

Throughout the 20th century, the family continued to charter, sell, and purchase vessels of various types. In the two centuries of its operation, the Patitsas-Lemos family has managed over 100 ships developing a wide network of industry contacts.

In 1905 Christos M. Lemos purchased, together with other prominent Oinoussian families, the family's first steamer: the 2,339 gross ton “Marietta Ralli”. Christos M. Lemos, who also became the first captain of the steamer, continued to build the fleet through the purchases of s/s “Triaina” and s/s “Efploia”.

His sons, including Captain Leon Lemos, further expanded the shipping business by co-founding the London-based company “Lemos & Pateras” in 1937. In recognition of their contribution in World War II and as compensation for the losses they suffered, the family, in 1947, bought the “Hellas”, one of the hundred newly available Liberty ships. Captain Leon Lemos became a prominent Greek shipowner in the 1970s and 1980s, building up a fleet of 17 vessels.

Captain Leon Lemos was the father of Mrs. Marigo Patitsas-Lemos, and the grandfather of Leon and Philemon Patitsas. Their father Spyros Patitsas entered the family business in 1968.
