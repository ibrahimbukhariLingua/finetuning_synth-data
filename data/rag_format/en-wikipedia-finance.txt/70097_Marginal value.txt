Marginal value


# Marginal value



A **marginal value** is

1. a value that holds true given particular constraints,
2. the *change* in a value associated with a specific change in some independent variable, whether it be of that variable or of a dependent variable, or
3. [when underlying values are quantified] the *ratio* of the change of a dependent variable to that of the independent variable.

(This third case is actually a special case of the second).

In the case of differentiability, at the limit, a marginal change is a mathematical differential, or the corresponding mathematical derivative.

These uses of the term “marginal” are especially common in economics, and result from conceptualizing constraints as *borders* or as *margins*. The sorts of marginal values most common to economic analysis are those associated with *unit* changes of resources and, in mainstream economics, those associated with *infinitesimal* changes. Marginal values associated with units are considered because many decisions are made by unit, and marginalism explains *unit price* in terms of such marginal values. Mainstream economics uses infinitesimal values in much of its analysis for reasons of mathematical tractability.


## Quantified conception

Assume a functional relationship


### Discrete change

If the value of {\displaystyle x\_{i}} is *discretely* changed from {\displaystyle x\_{i,0}} to {\displaystyle x\_{i,1}} while other independent variables remain unchanged, then the marginal value of the change in {\displaystyle x\_{i}} is

and the “marginal value” of {\displaystyle y} may refer to

or to


#### Example

If an individual saw her income increase from $50000 to $55000 per annum, and part of her response was to increase yearly purchases of amontillado from two casks to three casks, then

* the marginal increase in her income was $5000
* the marginal effect on her purchase of amontillado was an increase of one cask, or of one cask per $5000.

### Infinitesimal margins

If *infinitesimal* values are considered, then a marginal value of {\displaystyle x\_{i}} would be {\displaystyle dx\_{i}}, and the “marginal value” of {\displaystyle y} would typically refer to

(For a linear functional relationship {\displaystyle y=a+b\cdot x}, the marginal value of {\displaystyle y} will simply be the co-efficient of {\displaystyle x} (in this case, {\displaystyle b}) and this will not change as {\displaystyle x} changes. However, in the case where the functional relationship is non-linear, say {\displaystyle y=a\cdot b^{x}}, the marginal value of {\displaystyle y} will be different for different values of {\displaystyle x}.)


#### Example

Assume that, in some economy, aggregate consumption is well-approximated by

where

* {\displaystyle Y} is aggregate income.

Then the *marginal propensity to consume* is
