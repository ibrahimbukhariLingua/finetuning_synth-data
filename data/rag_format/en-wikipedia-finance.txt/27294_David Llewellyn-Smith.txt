## Criticism

In 2022, in response to a proposed security deal between the Solomon Islands and China, Llewellyn-Smith called for Australia to invade the islands and "engineer regime change in Honiara". In response, South China Morning Post's Alex Lo stated in an opinion piece that Llewellyn-Smith's position was "irrational", and that it "would have been funny if the piece was written by just another extreme right-wing head case".
