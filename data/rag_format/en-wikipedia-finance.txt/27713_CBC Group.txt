**CBC Group** (CBC; Chinese: 康桥资本; pinyin: *Kāngqiáo Zīběn*) is an Asian investment firm headquartered in Singapore. It is focused on private investments in the healthcare and biotechnology industries. It is considered the largest healthcare-focused investment firm in Asia.


## Background

The firm was founded in 2014 as C-Bridge Capital in Shanghai with a focus on private equity investments in China's healthcare sector. The firm was partially backed by Temasek Holdings. C-Bridge Capital would later be rebranded to CBC Group and moved its headquarters to Singapore.

CBC primarily invests in late stage companies that already have commercially proven projects which have passed clinical trials. However it has also funded healthcare Startup Companies with its initial strategy of just making minority investments to later taking a business incubator approach. Historically the firm has invested primarily in China, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong kong but has also invested in US-based companies that planned to expand in Asia. CBC would often pursue a strategy of backing companies that already have approved products in developed markets and bring them to China.
