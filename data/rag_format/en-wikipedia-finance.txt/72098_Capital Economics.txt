## History

Roger Bootle founded Capital Economics in 1999. He and Capital Economics won the £250,000 Wolfson Economics Prize in 2012, "for the best plan for dealing with member states leaving the eurozone".

In 2014, Bootle sold a stake in Capital Economics to part of Lloyds Banking Group; the transaction valued his company at £70 million. Four years later, Phoenix Equity Partners purchased a majority stake in the consultancy from Bootle; this valued the business at £95 million. Bootle retained his chairman role and a reduced financial interest in Capital Economics.
