# Francisco Mayorga



**Francisco Mayorga** (Born April 10th, 1949 in León, Nicaragua) is a Nicaraguan economist and writer who specializes in international finance and economic development.

For twenty years he taught managerial economics and corporate finance at INCAE, the leading Latin American graduate business school.

During the eighties he served for five years in the board of directors of the Central American Bank for Integration (*CABEI*), the largest financial institution of the region. Also during the eighties, Mayorga worked for the cause of peace in Central America, acting as Executive Secretary of the International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development (the *Sanford Commission*). Under the presidency of Violeta Chamorro he served as president of the Central Bank of Nicaragua in 1990, where he launched the monetary reform based on the Cordoba Oro that brought to an end the highest hyperinflation in Latin America.

In 1995 he founded Banco del Café de Nicaragua, serving as its President and CEO until the year 2000, when in the midst of a banking crisis it collapsed along with half of the Nicaraguan financial institutions.

An active Christian Democrat and opponent to the government of Arnoldo Alemán, Mayorga was prosecuted on the basis of charges which proved to be false. Mayorga was never convicted but spent two and a half years in jail as a political prisoner. He faced trial twice, assuming his own defense. Mayorga succeeded in winning his acquittal by two successive juries in 2001 and 2003. The Human Rights Commissioner of Nicaragua declared twice the violation of Mayorga's rights: one for retardation of justice and one for double jeopardy.

Both books continue to exercise considerable influence in the debate about the Nicaraguan economy.
