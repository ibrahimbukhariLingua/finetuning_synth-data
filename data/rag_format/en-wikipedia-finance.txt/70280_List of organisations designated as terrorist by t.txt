List of organisations designated as terrorist by the European Union


# List of organisations designated as terrorist by the European Union



The **European Union has two lists of designated terrorist organisations** that provide for different sanctions for the two groups. The first list is copied from the United Nations and relates to EU external terrorist organisations, and the second is an autonomous list and relates to EU internal terrorist organisations. There is a specific process for adding or removing an organisation from the list.


## Autonomous list

All other designated organizations.

* the freezing of all funds, other financial assets and economic resources.
* a ban on directly or indirectly making funds, other financial assets and economic resources available.

It is important to note that sanctions are only applicable to EU-external groups regardless of designation. For example, 47 groups are listed as terrorist organizations in the EU but sanctions are only applied to 27 of these. Member States do have an obligation to assist each other in preventing and combating terrorist acts but this is the only action that follows from the designation of an EU-internal organization.

## Listing process

New organizations are added to the autonomous list following this process:

1. "Designation": Member states and third party states tips about an organization. This state must have solid evidence and must the tip must be sent by the national authority.
2. Scrutinity: The Presidency, or a delegation, gathers basic information, and might require more information from the tipping state.
3. Consultations: Information is shared with other member states for discussion. Everything is still confidential. 15 days after, delegates of the states meet as the CP 931 Working Party, Europol is sometimes invited too.
4. Recommendation: The CP 931 Working Party prepares the listing decision.
5. Decision by EU Council: The council adopts the list. The decision must be unanimous, which means that every state has a veto right.
6. Official Publishing: In the EU Official Journal
7. Notification and Statement of Reason: The council secretariat notifies each designated organization via mail, together with instructions on how to get the decision to be reconsidered.

## Delisting process

The EU has similar process to review the list, and to remove organizations for the list.
