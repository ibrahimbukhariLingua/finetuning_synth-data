## History

Linx was founded in 1985 by São Paulo native, Nércio Fernandes. At age 22, Nércio dropped out of college, leaving his studies in Civil Engineering to invest in his own business in the micro-computing field. He and his partners gave the company its first name: Microserv Comércio & Consultoria Ltda.

A few years after its inauguration, the company was serving small businesses in the regions of Brás and Bom Retiro in São Paulo, when MicroMalhas was created – a software geared towards fashion retail. In 1990, the software was renamed Linx, and later became Linx ERP – the group's flagship software, geared towards different retail segments.
Linx Logística, a unit specialized in internal logistics, was created in 2000. With a more complex structure, and with the parallel operation of Linx Sistemas, Linx Logística and Linx Telecom – created to focus on the outsourcing of connectivity and telecommunication options for retail – the creation of a holding company was necessary in order to unify the business units. In 2004, LMI S.A. emerged, and later was renamed Linx S.A.
