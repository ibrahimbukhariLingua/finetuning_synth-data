## History

Hotai's predecessor Watai Yoko (Hotai Trading Co.) was founded in 1937 in Kobe, Japan by Lieh-ho Huang in 1937 at the age of 27 to trade textile and sundry items. After the end of WWII. Eyeing the petroleum need in Taiwan in the postwar reconstruction period, Hotai quickly obtained the distribution contract from Exxon Mobil Corporation to ship petroleum from Shanghai and sell it in Taiwan. Also, eyeing the cane sugar need of the China market, Hotai shipped sugar from Taiwan to China and sold it in China. After shipping sugar to China, Hotai shipped petroleum from Shanghai to Taiwan with the same vessel to maximize operating efficiency. Later on, this practice built a good financial foundation for the future of Hotai.

A few years later, eyeing at the development potential of the transportation industry in Taiwan, Huang went to Japan again to discuss business with local industries and formally registered the company in Taiwan in September 1947, creating the modern entity known today.

This started the diversification of Wei-Chuan into an integrated food manufacturing company. With the food business diversification planning of Huang, Wei-Chuan became the largest food processing and manufacturing company in Taiwan in the 1960s and 1970s.
