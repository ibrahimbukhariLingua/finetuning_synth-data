Renters' Rights Bill 2024


# Renters' Rights Bill 2024



The **Renters' Rights Bill 2024** is a proposed Act of Parliament designed to improve the rights of people renting homes in the United Kingdom, and has been called a "key plank of the government's housing reforms".


## Background

The Renters (Reform) Bill 2023 proposed by the Conservative government did not pass before the 2024 United Kingdom general election. Instead, the new Labour government proposed its own Renters' Rights Bill in September 2024 with certain additional rights.


## Contents

Sections 1 to 3 would end "assured shorthold tenancies" and require that assured tenancies are period with rent each month.

Sections 4 to 6 narrow the grounds for eviction and possession by a landlord, and requires four months notice before any eviction for sale of a property, housing a family member, or moving back in. Section 57 raises penalties for unlawful eviction or the harassment of an occupier. Schedule 1 contains changes to grounds for possession. Landlords are banned from evicting a tenant in the first year of a tenancy.

Sections 7 to 9 enable a tenant to challenge increases of rent. At least two months notice must be given before raising rent at the end of any contract. Sections 55 and 56 require the rent to be stated and aims to avoid rental bidding. Landlords cannot take higher rent than advertised, also if offered by a tenant.

Section 10 enable tenants the right to request permission to keep a pet, and landlords may only refuse if they have a good reason. Section 11 relates to pet insurance.

Section 12 requires landlords to give a statement of terms of the contract.

Sections 25 and 26 relate to deposits and restrict tenant fees.

Sections 32 to 54 prohibit discrimination against tenants based on them having children, or being on benefits.

Sections 73 to 94 require a private rented sector database to be created.

Section 98 requires a new "decent homes standard", together with Schedule 4.

Part 4 concerns enforcement through rent repayment orders, by local housing authorities, and enables investigatory powers.


## Significance

The Bill's aim is to "dampen rent rises", after in the year to July 2024, "average private-sector rents in England increased 8.6%, while in London that figure was 9.7%. Recent figures from Rightmove suggest there are now 17 households bidding for each advertised rental property."
