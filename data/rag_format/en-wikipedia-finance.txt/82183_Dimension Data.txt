**Dimension Data** was a company specialising in information technology services. Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the company maintained operations on every inhabited continent. Dimension Data focused on services including IT consulting, technical and support services, and managed services. The company was the official technology partner of the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España and also sponsored a team of the same name. In 2010, the company was fully acquired by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). On 1 July 2019, all Dimension Data operations, excluding those in the Middle East and Africa, became part of NTT Ltd.


## History

Dimension Data was founded in 1983 by Keith McLachlan, Werner Sievers, Jeremy Ord, Peter Neale, and Kevin Hamilton. The company was listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on 15 July 1987. Jeremy Ord was appointed as the company's executive chairman in that same year (a position he continued to hold as of 2016). In 1991, the company became the official South African distributor for Cisco Systems.

In 1993, the company expanded to Botswana, and, between 1995 and 1997, it began further expansion into the Asia Pacific region. In 1996, Dimension Data purchased a 45% stake in the Australian company, ComTech. It would later buyout the company fully in 2000. The company also bought a stake in the South African company, Internet Solutions, in 1996. Dimension Data would increase their stake in the company the following year. Also in 1997 the company purchased majority stakes in The Merchants Group and Datacraft.

Between 1998 and 2000, the company focused its expansion efforts on the northern hemisphere, investing in and acquiring a variety of companies in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. One such acquisition was the 1998 purchase of London-based telecommunications company, Plessey. On 31 July 2000, Dimension Data was listed on the London Stock Exchange raising $1.25 billion in the process. By 2003, the company's revenue had jumped to $2 billion.

In 2004, Brett Dawson was appointed as CEO of the company and Jeremy Ord was appointed as Group Executive Chairman. Over the next 6 years, the company expanded in Africa, the Middle East, and South America. By September 2009, the company had an annual revenue of around $4 billion.

In July 2010, Dimension Data was acquired by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) for £2.1 billion ($3.2 billion). In October of that year, NTT announced that Dimension Data would be delisted from both the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange by the end of the year. Over the next few years, Dimension Data continued acquiring and integrating businesses like OpSource, NextiraOne, and Oakton.

In June 2016, Brett Dawson stepped down as CEO and was replaced by then COO, Jason Goodall. At the time, Dimension Data maintained 31,000 staff in 58 countries across all 6 inhabited continents. The annual revenue of the company was $7.5 billion.

On 1 July 2019, the majority of Dimension Data became part of NTT Ltd., along with NTT Security and NTT Communications. However, the brand continues to operate in the Middle East & Africa with Grant Bodley as CEO.

On 1 April 2021, Werner Kapp was appointed as CEO of the company, as Grant Bodley has resigned.

In June 2022, NTT announced the appointment of Alan Turnley-Jones to succeed Kapp as CEO.

In October 2023, it was announced that Dimension Data will become NTT Data, Inc. with effect from 1 April 2024. Alan Turnley-Jones will continue to lead the business in Africa and the Middle East.
