## History

COPT Defense Properties was initially founded in Minnesota in 1988 as Royale Investments, Inc., eventually developing into an externally advised REIT.

In October 1997, Royale Investments acquired the Mid Atlantic operations of The Shidler Group.

The combined entity, now a self-administered REIT, adopted the name Corporate Office Properties Trust.

Corporate Office Properties Trust, became a public company on April 23, 1998, by listing its shares on the NYSE under the ticker symbol OFC.

Since 2011, Company deeply concentrated its real estate portfolio at locations proximate to, or sometimes containing, priority National Defense missions, and mission critical operations.

In September 2023, the Company changed its name from Corporate Office Properties Trust to COPT Defense Properties, and changed its NYSE ticker symbol to CDP, to better describe its investment strategy’s focus on locations serving U.S. priority defense activities.
