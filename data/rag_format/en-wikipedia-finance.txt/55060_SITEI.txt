**The SITEI (Sustainability in the Extractive Industries) Conference** is an annual conference and workshop for key stakeholders and industry experts in extractive industries, which has been held in Abuja, Nigeria, since 2012.


## History

At the 2015 conference, all the stakeholders including the Nigerian government endorsed plans to develop the mining industry of Nigeria. The 2017 conference grew to two days, featuring 25 speakers from the sector and 500 senior executives.

The conferences have been organized by sustainability consultancy CSR-in-Action in partnership with NEITI and the Nigerian Government Chapter of the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
