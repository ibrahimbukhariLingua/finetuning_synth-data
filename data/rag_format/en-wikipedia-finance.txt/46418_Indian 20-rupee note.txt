Indian 20-rupee note


# Indian 20-rupee note



The **Indian 20-rupee banknote** (₹20) is a common denomination of the Indian rupee. The current ₹20 banknote in circulation is a part of the Mahatma Gandhi New Series. The Reserve Bank introduced the ₹20 note in the Mahatma Gandhi New Series in 2019, making it the last denomination to be introduced in the series.

It was first introduced by the Reserve Bank of India in 1972 to contain the cost of production of banknotes in circulation. With the introduction of this banknote, the Reserve Bank started a major redesign of the motif of the Lion Capital Series banknotes.


## Mahatma Gandhi New Series

On 10 November 2016, the then Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das announced a new ₹20 banknote would be released in the Mahatma Gandhi New Series in the coming months.

The Reserve Bank of India has announced on 26 April 2019 that it would shortly issue a new ₹20 note. The new denomination has a motif of Ellora Caves on the back, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra, India on the reverse, depicting the country's cultural heritage continuing with the theme in Mahatma Gandhi New Series banknotes. Size of the bank note will be 129 mm × 63 mm. This is used alongside to the new Indian 20-rupee coin.
