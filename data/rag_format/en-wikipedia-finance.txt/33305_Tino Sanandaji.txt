**Tino Sanandaji** (born 17 May 1980) is an Iranian–Swedish economist and author.


## Early life and career

Sanandaji arrived in Sweden in 1989 with his family as a 9-year-old and grew up in Norrköping and Ale Municipality. He earned a MSc in Economics and Business Administration from Stockholm School of Economics in 2003 and a PhD from the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago in 2011. His PhD dissertation is titled *Essays in Entrepreneurship Policy*.

As of 2017, Sanandaji works as a researcher at the Institute for Economic and Business History Research at the Stockholm School of Economics. He has authored a number of scholarly articles on economics, with a focus on entrepreneurship and taxation. Sanandaji also has a blog where he publishes articles on government policy. He is especially critical of the far-right Sweden Democrats party.

Sanandaji is a vocal critic of Sweden's policy on immigration of low-educated migrants from developing countries, but also of supporters of the anti-immigration party Sweden Democrats. He approaches the issue from an internal perspective, as both an immigrant himself and a former resident of various areas of social deprivation. According to Sanandaji, he has not conducted basic research on immigration but instead refers to research and statistics collected by other researchers. As of 2014ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, he describes his profession as economic research and writing on immigration as an unpaid hobby.
