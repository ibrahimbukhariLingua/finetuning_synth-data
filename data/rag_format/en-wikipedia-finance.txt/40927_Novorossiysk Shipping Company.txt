Novorossiysk Shipping Company


# Novorossiysk Shipping Company



**Novorossiysk Shipping Company** (**Novoship**) was a Russian shipping company and one of the largest in the country. The full name was *Public Joint-Stock Company "Novorossiysk Shipping Company"*. The headquarters were located in Novorossiysk.


## History

The company was founded in 1964.

In 1967, it became an independent enterprise, as on 20 January 1967, the tanker division of the Black Sea Shipping Company separated. The fleet was transferred to the Novorossiysk Shipping Company, founded in 1964, with the aim of effectively managing the operations of the oil tanker fleet and ports in the Black Sea basin, eliminating multi-tiered management, and more promptly addressing transportation issues with the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the USSR and other interested organizations.

In 1992, the company was privatized.

In mid-June 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree to form a new company based on *Sovcomflot* and *Novoship*. According to this decree, within nine months, the 50.34% state-owned share in *Novoship* would be contributed to the charter capital of *Sovcomflot*. As expected, the merger would create a shipping company that would be among the top five largest tanker carriers in the world. The capitalization of the new company was estimated to be $3.5-4 billion.
