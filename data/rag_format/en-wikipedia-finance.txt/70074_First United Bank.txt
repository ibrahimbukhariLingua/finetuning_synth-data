## History

First United began as Durant National Bank on Oct. 2, 1900, when it first opened in Bryan County, Choctaw Nation Territory (known today as Durant, Oklahoma). In 1915, Durant National Bank absorbed eight banks in the Oklahoma region, and, in 1916, constructed a new building in Durant at 2nd and Main Streets. In 1963, Durant National Bank was renamed to Durant Bank & Trust, becoming one of the first banks in Oklahoma to have full trust powers. Durant Bank & Trust was then renamed to be First United Bank in 1998.

John Massey, an Oklahoma native, joined Durant Bank & Trust in 1966 as a director and was appointed chairman of the board in 1986. At that time, he also became the majority shareholder and CEO. Greg Massey joined the bank in 1990, and succeeded his father as CEO in 2003. After a series of acquisitions, including the merger with American Bank of Texas in 2016, First United has grown to 73 locations in Oklahoma and Texas with $12.5 billion in assets.
