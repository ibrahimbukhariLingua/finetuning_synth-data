## Career

At 16, he edited the menswear section of the 1977 *Harpers & Queen Teenage Edition*, but Boden's father was "dismissive", calling it a "stupid job".

After leaving university, Boden became a stockbroker with Barclays Merchant Bank, and SG Warburg Securities. spending some time at Wall Street. He was a stockbroker for five years.
