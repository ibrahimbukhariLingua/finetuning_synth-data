## Tasman Liquor Company

Tasman Liquor Company is based in Wiri, Auckland. It has 114 franchisees around New Zealand operating as The Bottle O and Merchants Liquor, including 36 in the Auckland Region.


### History

In 2020 the company was accused of failing to address migrant worker exploitation by some of its franchisees. One former owner of 12 stores failed 19 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment inspections; one former worker accused him of "modern day slavery". Tasman Liquor said it did not support the practices, and would comply with authorities.


## Liquor Centre

Liquor Centre is a New Zealand liquor franchiser founded in 1992.

It claims to be the largest liquor store network in New Zealand, with 240 stores around the country. There are 175 Liquor Centre stores and 41 Liquor Spot stores listed on the company's website. The remaining stores are part of the buying network but do not have branding. Within the Auckland region there are 71 branded stores, including 41 Liquor Centre stores an 29 Liquor Spot stores.

Tasman Liquor Company supplies liquor to stores in the Liquor Centre network. Metcash purchased the franchise itself in June 2020, one of a group of acquisitions it was making at the time. Metcash told shareholders the purchase was a "bolt-on" acquisition to add to its existing liquor portfolio, significantly expanding its retail network in New Zealand.


### History

In 2019, the owners of the Grafton, Auckland Liquor Spot store were ordered to pay almost NZ$200,000 in penalties and arrears to staff for breaches of labour laws.

In November 2020, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment secured a freezing order to stop the owners of four Bay of Plenty stores from selling stores while it sought penalties for serious breaches to labour laws.

In March 2021, the Royal Oak, Auckland store joined UberEats in a trial of alcohol delivery.
