## History

On 12 December 1944, Compañía Suramericana de Seguros S.A. was created in Medellín, Antioquia, dedicated to the insurance activity in Colombia. The company grew and generated new lines of business, and incorporated other important Colombian companies into its investment portfolio. In the 1970s, in the face of hostile takeover attempts by economic groups from other regions of the country, a process was carried out to protect the regional industry through share exchanges between companies of Antioquia origin, such as Suramericana de Seguros, Cementos Argos and National Chocolate Company, among others.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 1997, Compañía Suramericana de Seguros was restructured through a spin-off, through which the management of the investment portfolio was separated from the insurance operating activity. As a result, the Suramericana de Inversiones S.A. company was born, the latter becoming the parent company.

In July 2011, Grupo Sura acquired the divestments from the ING Group in Latin America for US$3.85 billion. With the acquisition, Grupo Sura gained control of ING's pension and voluntary savings businesses in Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and ING's 80% stake in AFP Integra S.A. in Peru; the life insurance businesses in Chile and Peru; including ING's 33.7% stake in InVita Seguros de Vida S.A. in Peru, along with the local investment management capabilities in those countries.

In February 2015, Grupo Sura acquired Seguros Banistmo in Panama for a value of USD$96.4 million, making it a strong competitor in the Central American country with sales of USD$126,400 in 2016 and occupying fourth place below ASSA, International Insurance and Mapfre.

In September 2015, Grupo Sura purchased RSA's Latin American operations for £ 403 Million. With the acquisition, Grupo Sura entered the Argentine, Brazilian, and Uruguayan insurance markets, and enlarged their operations in Colombia, Chile, and Mexico.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
