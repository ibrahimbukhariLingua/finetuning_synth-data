## History


### Pre-Grange

In February 1933, the Town and Village Insurance Company Services worked under an agreement with Grange Insurance Services, Inc. to write automobile insurance for members of the Ohio State Grange. Grange Insurance Services, Inc. served as a general agent in Ohio and conducted all sales efforts and promotions. Town and Village Insurance Services then wrote business under a special automobile policy provided by the New Century Casualty Company of Chicago, Illinois.


### Early history

On March 25, 1935, Grange Mutual Casualty Company was formed as a non-profit corporation under the General Code of Ohio and as such, assumed the book of business from Town and Village Insurance Services. Its principal business was writing property and casualty insurance coverage for policyholders as a mutual insurance company.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Grange Mutual was originally an assessment company, and limited its sales to Ohio State Grange members. In 1942, a new hospitalization policy was introduced and offered to Grange members. In 1944, a general liability policy was added to the Grange line of products. Fire and extended coverages became available in 1955. By this time, Grange was a multiple line company. In 1958, Grange Mutual became independent of Ohio State Grange, and offered its products to the general public within the State of Ohio.
