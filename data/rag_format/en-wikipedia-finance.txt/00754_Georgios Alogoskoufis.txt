## Background, academic and political career

George Alogoskoufis was born in Athens on 17 October 1955.


## The economic policy mix applied under the leadership of Alogoskoufis

In the period in which Alogoskoufis served as the minister for Economy and Finance, he actuated a series of economic structural reforms and fiscal adjustment to contain budget deficits, which, although unpopular, have failed to slash Greece's high 2004 budget deficit (from 5.7% in 2003 to 9.8% in 2008). In the same period of time, Greece's gross domestic product has grown by one of the highest growth rates in the Eurozone. Unemployment also fell significantly.

During 2004–2007, marginal corporate and personal income taxes were reduced. He worked extensively with the private sector and sold over euro 6 billion of government holdings. However, these reforms did not prove sufficient to avert Greece external debt crisis in 2010.
