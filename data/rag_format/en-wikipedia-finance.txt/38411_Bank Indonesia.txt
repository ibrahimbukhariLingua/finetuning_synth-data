Bank Indonesia


# Bank Indonesia



**Bank Indonesia** (**BI**) is the central bank of the Republic of Indonesia. It replaced in 1953 the Bank of Java (Dutch: *De Javasche Bank*, DJB), which had been created in 1828 to serve the financial needs of the Dutch East Indies.


## History


### Bank of Java

King William I of the Netherlands granted the right to create a private bank in the Indies in 1826, which was named *De Javasche Bank*. It was founded on 24 January 1828 and later became the bank of issue of the Dutch East Indies. The bank regulated and issued the Netherlands Indies gulden.

In 1881, an office of the Bank of Java was opened in Amsterdam. Later followed the opening of an office in New York. By 1930 the bank owned sixteen office branches in the Dutch East Indies: Bandung, Cirebon, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaya, Malang, Kediri, Banda Aceh, Medan, Padang, Palembang, Banjarmasin, Pontianak, Makassar, and Manado.

The Bank of Java was operated as a private bank and individuals as well as industries etc. could get help in the bank's offices.


### Bank Indonesia

Bank Indonesia was founded on 1 July 1953 from the nationalisation of *De Javasche Bank*, three years after the recognition of Indonesia's independence by Netherlands.

For the next 15 years, Bank Indonesia carried on commercial activities as well as acting as the nation's national bank and is in charge in issuing Indonesian rupiah currency. This came to an end with the Act No. 13 of 1968 on the Central Bank, transforming Bank Indonesia as a central bank.

The act was subsequently replaced by Act No. 23 of 1999, giving the bank independence from governmental control. Thereafter, the bank reported to the parliament (DPR) instead of the President, and the bank's governor was no longer a member of the cabinet.


## Organization

The bank is led by the board of governors, comprising the governor, a senior deputy governor and at between four and seven deputy governors.

The governor and deputy governors serve a five-year term, and are eligible for re-election for a maximum of three terms. The governor and senior deputy governor are nominated and appointed by the president, with approval from the DPR. Deputy governors are nominated by the governor and appointed by the president, with approval of the DPR. The president has no power to dismiss a member of the board, except when a board member voluntarily resigns, is permanently disabled, or is proven guilty of criminal offence. The senior deputy governor acts as governor in the case of the latter's office vacancy.

The Board of Governors Meeting is the bank's highest decision-making forum. It is held at least once a month to decide on general policy on monetary affairs, and at least once a week to evaluate policy implementation or to decide on other strategic and principle policy.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Bank is active in promoting financial inclusion policy and is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. It hosted AFI's second annual Global Policy Forum (GPF) in Bali, Indonesia in 2010. On 14 May 2012 Bank Indonesia announced it would be making specific commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

By 30 December 2013, the bank's microprudential supervision functions will be transferred to Financial Services Authority (OJK). In the future, the bank will maintain Indonesian financial system and monetary stability through mixture of monetary and macroprudential instruments and policies. The Financial Services Authority institutive law (law n° 21 of 2011 enacted on 31 December 2012) followed the US$710 million baylout of Bank Century and the receivership 21 other national private banks.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### Bank Indonesia Liquidity Support

**Bank Indonesia Liquidity Support** is an Indonesian government policy that was formulated with Bank Indonesia in the crisis period and executed by Bank Indonesia to rescue the monetary and banking system as well as the economy as a whole.
