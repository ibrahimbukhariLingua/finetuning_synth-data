# James M. Hull College of Business



The **James M. Hull College of Business** at Augusta University offers four undergraduate degrees, as well as a Master of Business Administration. It is located on the Summerville campus, with classes primarily located in Allgood Hall. It is accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and has been named one of the top business schools in the country by The Princeton Review multiple times.


## History

The school's beginnings can be traced to a Board of Regents decision to allow a degree in Business Administration to be awarded to Augusta College upon the school's successful transition to a four-year college in 1963. Eight years later, the college was allowed to offer its first MBA, and the School of Business Administration became official, earning a name change to the College of Business Administration in 1996 when Augusta College's name changed to Augusta State University.

In 2006, James Hull, owner of one of the United Statesâ€™ largest shopping mall developers, made a donation of $2 million to the university specifically earmarked for the College of Business. In response, school officials renamed the college to its current name to honor the investment, which was the largest in then-Augusta State University's history.
