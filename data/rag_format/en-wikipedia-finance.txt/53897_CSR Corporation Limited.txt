## Controversy

In June 2016 the CSR along with members of the Gupta family were accused of trying to improperly influence the awarding of a R51 billion (US$6 billion) 2012 contract for CSR to deliver 600 trains to the South African Passenger Rail Agency. It was later reported that the future South African Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane was also allegedly implicated in the deal when she worked as Counselor Immigration and Civic Services in South Africa's embassy in China.
