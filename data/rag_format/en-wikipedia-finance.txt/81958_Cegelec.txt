Cegelec


# Cegelec



**Cegelec** or **Actemium** is a French engineering company specialized in electrical infrastructure, HVAC, information technology, nuclear energy development, transport infrastructure, robotics and offering both public and private services. Cegelec was officially formed in 1989, and as of 2014 the company employs around 22,000 people and operates in 30 countries, with major activity in France, Brazil, Indonesia, the Middle East and Africa. It was acquired by **Vinci Energies** on 14 April 2010, assimilating the collection of Cegelec's sub-companies, which each specialize in a specific field or geographical region, into Vinci's corporate system.


## History

In 1913 the company Compagnie Générale d'Entreprises Électriques (CGEE) was established by the Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE).

In 1971 it was renamed CGEE-Alstom. In 1989 CGE and General Electric Company formed the joint operation GEC-Alstom, and CGEE-Alstom was renamed Cegelec. In 1999 Cegelec became *Alstom Entreprise* and *Alstom Contracting*.

On 20 July 2001 Alstom Contracting was subject to a Leveraged Management Buyout supported by Caisse des dépôts et consignations and Charterhouse Capital Partners, and was renamed Cegelec.

The company was acquired by private equity fund LBO France in 2006. In 2008 Qatari Diar became the majority shareholder. In September 2009, Cegelec was purchased by Vinci.
In 2014, Cegelec adopted the Actemium brand name.


## Organisation

After Vinci's acquisition of the company from Qatari Diar in 2010, Cegelec's organisation and operation under the Cegelec company title did not change; Vinci's energy and engineering divisions have assisted Cegelec endeavors but have not actively changed the organisational structure of Cegelec.

Cegelec is split into 15 separate sub-companies, which are all owned by the overarching Cegelec company known as Cegelec Enterprise. After the acquisition, the administration and direction of each company were controlled by Vinci Energies, yet each sub-company maintained their original specializations. The following are all the Cegelec sub-companies listed on Cegelec.com as of 17/April/2020:

## Geographic Areas of Influence


### France

From the 2010 Cegelec Financial Report, 58.1% of Cegelec's total sales were made within France, the country which contains the highest diversity of Cegelec's operations, hosting their nuclear, marine, defense and the largest amount of electrical engineering/transport sub-companies. Cegelec's international headquarters are in Saint-Denis, acting as the central hub for Cegelec's international interactions. One of their recent contracts in France was the assignment “to design remote handling equipment for France’s proposed underground [nuclear] repository” in 2014. This contract was estimated to be valued at €20 million and took approximately four years to complete.


### Rest of Europe

Excluding France, the rest of Europe constituted 26% of annual sales in 2010, with countries closer to France yielding higher revenue. Operations in each nation vary from team to team, with countries like the Netherlands and the Czech Republic having their websites in the local language and conducting business independently of the broader Cegelec brand name.

List of countries in which Cegelec has been involved in Europe (excluding France) since 2010:

* Austria
* Belgium

## Scientific Achievements

As an engineering company, Cegelec has contributed to the global community in the fields of nuclear engineering, electrification logistics, robotics, infrastructure, information systems and safety systems. Developments in which they have participated include a programmable safety protection system (SPS – AC 132–16), which was one of the centrepieces of nuclear reactor safety protocols and controllers in 1999. The code base and core components of this system have been integrated into modern nuclear plants, which Cegelec has been contracted to develop, maintain and innovate for clients. They own various patents on energy technology (primarily transistor and energy-loss prevention techniques) that have since been incorporated into current energy sources. Two such patents that pertain to renewable energy include design components for a wave energy converter and a variable speed converter for wind turbines, put forth at the 1997 IEE Colloquium, and implemented in later projects. Cegelec designed and implemented a common DC bus fed inverter for the wave energy power generator known as the OSPREY (Ocean Swell Powered Renewable EnergY) project, a new generation of international, modular wave energy generators; Cegelec's role in this project was regulating the electrical output of each generator and maximizing conversion efficiency. For wind turbines, Cegelec developed a product called Alspa GD4000, a “bi-directional 45 kW power electronic variable speed driver and controller,” used for integrating generators and flywheel systems within wind turbines. Both patents and consequent projects center around electrical energy conversion and provided a foundation for future advances in both wave and wind energy technology, fields which are generally not as profitable for Cegelec as nuclear, coal, and electrical infrastructure work.

International, large-scale scientific projects that Cegelec has been invited to work in include the two below:

The first is their participation in the ITER fusion program starting in 2016, known as Fusion For Energy (F4E), in which they have been employed to design, produce, operate and maintain remote handling equipment to function within the fusion reactor. According to World Nuclear News, Fusion For Energy is the “world's largest experimental nuclear fusion facility,” and is at the forefront of the scientific community in the field of fusion energy; Cegelec's involvement in the first Cask and Plus Remote Handling System (CPRHS) of this size is one of Cegelec's most globally renowned nuclear projects.

In 2017, they were contracted to by the Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) to remodel and create cryogenic interfaces operating between Ariane 6 rocket launch systems and the ground systems in French Guiana. The CNES aimed to horizontally integrate the entire launcher system for the first time in the Ariane space programs history, tasking Latecoere Services (the lead contractor), Air Liquide and Cegelec to allow fuelling arms to operate efficiently within this system.
