## Business career


### DAI and IC Manage

### Barracuda Networks

Also in 2003, Drako founded Barracuda Networks and introduced their email spam and virus appliance product line. Other Barracuda product lines launched during Drako's tenure were: web filters, load balancers, email archiving, and digital PBXs.

Drako executed six acquisitions by Barracuda Networks: In 2007, NetContinuum, an application controller company; in 2008, BitLeap, a provider of cloud-based backup services, and 3SP, an SSL and VPN company; in 2009, Yosemite Technologies, for incremental backup of applications; a controlling interest in phion AG, an Austria-based public enterprise-class firewalls company, and Purewire Inc, a software as a service (SaaS) cloud-based web filtering and security company. Drako contributed to or supported 16 different open source projects while running Barracuda including Valgrind, Apache, and the Free Software Foundation.

Barracuda was ranked #2 by Glassdoor in 2011, with Drako receiving an 88% approval rating. Drako resigned from Barracuda Networks in July 2012 to found Eagle Eye Networks, while continuing to serve on Barracuda's board of directors until 2014. At the time of Drako’s resignation, Barracuda stated it was profitable, generating hundreds of millions in annual revenue, close to 30% year-over-year growth since inception, and had surpassed 150,000 customers.


### Eagle Eye Networks

Drako left Barracuda Networks in July 2012 to found Eagle Eye Networks, a cloud-based video security company, serving as CEO. He officially launched Eagle Eye Networks in 2014, stating that his desire to found the company was driven by his frustration when trying to set up a video security system for a remote office while CEO of Barracuda; he wanted to make video surveillance more accessible and far easier to use by leveraging the cloud. Drako has been credited with establishing the concept of ‘true cloud’ in the physical security industry, emphasizing the differences between applications designed specifically for the cloud and legacy-design applications being run on a cloud-hosted virtual server.

Drako initially financed Eagle Eye Networks himself, later raising multiple financing funding rounds: an undisclosed amount from Michael Dell in 2014, $40M series E in 2020, and $100 million Series F in 2023, with Drako continuing be the majority owner. Drako has stated that more recent funding was to accelerate the company's AI execution. Eagle Eye Networks ranked four times on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 list of fastest growing technology companies in North America (2019, 2020, 2021, and 2023).


### Brivo and Cobalt AI acquisitions

Drako has acquired two physical security companies, Brivo and Cobalt AI, both of which he operates as separate entities from Eagle Eye Networks. In 2015, Drako acquired cloud access control system provide **Brivo** for $50M and serves as Brivo's Chairman. In November 2022, Brivo closed long-term senior secured credit facility of $75 million with Runway Growth Capital. In 2023, Brivo raised $92M in financing, with Drako continuing to hold a majority share of the company.
In June 2024, Drako acquired **Cobalt AI**, a provider of enterprise AI alarm filtering, remote monitoring and security robot solutions, for an undisclosed sum, where he also serves as chairman.


### Drako Motors

Drako is co-founder and CEO of Drako Motors, an automotive software platform provider, which on August 6, 2015 announced its first product, the Drako DriveOS, a single VCU (vehicle control unit) operating system which controls all four wheels independently. In June 2019, Drako Motors pre-announced their Drako GTE electric quad-motor supercar, claiming speeds of up to 206 MPH and 1200 horsepower.

### PermRecord and Permanent Legacy Foundation

In 2015, Drako created the PermRecord Foundation with the stated purpose "to ensure the preservation of materials placed in its trust." This foundation contracted out to a commercial company, Permrecord, Inc., also founded by Drako, for its programming services. By 2019 this mission had evolved "to preserve and provide perpetual access to the digital legacy of all people for the historical and educational benefit of future generations." The foundation claims public charity status, but its public support percentage is zero, and it is completely controlled by its sole member (Dean Drako). The foundation does not appear to have any perpetual means to accomplish its mission, subsisting on occasional grants from Drako. The foundation's website hides its legal name and charity registration number under a "Brand Assets" page, but refers to itself under the DBA "Permanent Legacy Foundation". Its home page promises "We invest your contributions into a nonprofit endowment" but there is no record of that endowment in its public accounting records.


## Awards and recognition

Drako has been named a winner of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award twice: first, as CEO of Barracuda Networks (Northern California, Networking and Communications) in 2007, and later as CEO of Eagle Eye Networks (Gulf South Region) in 2024. In 2014, Goldman Sachs included Drako in its list of the 100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs.
