Rhenish gulden


# Rhenish gulden



The **Rhenish *gulden*** or **Rhenish *guilder*** (German: *Rheinischer Gulden*; Latin: *florenus Rheni*) was a gold, standard currency coin of the Rhineland in the 14th and 15th centuries. They weighed between 3.4 and 3.8 grams (0.12–0.13 oz).


## History

The Rhenish gold *gulden* was created when the electors of Cologne, Trier and Mainz were rewarded for their support in the election of Charles IV with a right to mint gold coins (*Goldmünzprivileg*), a right derived from the Golden Bull. Trier was given the privilege on 25 November 1346, Cologne on 26 November 1346 and Mainz on 22 January 1354.

The Rhenish *gulden* or *florin* began in 1354 as a copy of the Florentine *florin* (weight 1⁄66th a Cologne Mark of gold, 231⁄4 karats fine, or 3.43 g fine gold). However, by the early 15th century it has lost nearly one quarter of its gold content. In 1419 it was 1⁄67th a Cologne Mark of gold, 19 karats fine; hence 2.76 g fine gold.

As a result of the widespread minting of gold *guldens* by the electors of Cologne, Mainz, Trier and the Electorate of the Palatinate (Rhine Minting Association), Rhenish *guldens* achieved significance in the 14th and 15th centuries and became the base currency of the Rhine region. Due to a lack of gold there was a shortage of *gulden* in the late 15th and 16th century, and they were even minted with a gold content reduced by up to a half.

The *Reichsmünzordnung* or imperial minting ordinances of the Holy Roman Empire from 1524 to 1559 prescribed uniform minting standards for the Rhenish *gulden*. In 1559 the latter was prescribed as 1⁄72nd a Cologne Mark of gold, 181⁄2 karats - hence, 2.50 g fine gold. This standard Rhenish *gulden* was minted until the 18th century, and was minted concurrently with the gold ducat.


## Importance

Rhenish gold *guldens* were of central importance to the German monetary system until modern times. It developed into the most common long-distance trading coin in Bohemia, Hungary, Germany, Switzerland, Moravia, the Netherlands, Spain and France. Not only gold, but also silver coins were valued according to their value in Rhenish *guldens*, and thus their rate (value) was set.

The annual rent in the Augsburg *Fuggerei* is to this day a Rhenish *gulden* (€0.88 today).
