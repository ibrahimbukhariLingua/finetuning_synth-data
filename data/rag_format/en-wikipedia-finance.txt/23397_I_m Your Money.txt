I'm Your Money


# I'm Your Money



"**I'm Your Money**" is a song by English new wave and synth-pop band Heaven 17, released in May 1981 by Virgin as a non-album single. The song was written by band members Ian Craig Marsh, Martyn Ware and Glenn Gregory, and produced by B.E.F. (Ware and Marsh).


## Background

"I'm Your Money" was released as the band's second single on 15 May 1981. Despite their debut single "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" reaching number 45 in the UK Singles Chart earlier in the year, "I'm Your Money" failed to replicate the success and failed to chart, although it did reach number 59 on the *Record Business* Top 100 Singles Chart.

Speaking of the song's lyrics, Ware recalled to *The Quietus* in 2010, "I still think that's funny now. It's a very good analogy."


## Critical reception

Upon its release as a single, Peter Silverton of *Smash Hits* described "I'm Your Money" as sounding "just like Kraftwerk once sounded – conscious humour and all". He added that although it is "not as obviously funny" as the band's debut single "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang", it is "stronger and harder". Simon Tebbutt of *Record Mirror* was less enthusiastic, writing, "Seems like I'm one of the few not attracted to the cool sounds and automaton rhythms of Heaven 17. I prefer this to their last single but it all gets a bit relentless and monotonous really."

During his time DJ-ing in the 2000s, Philip Oakey of The Human League would always include "I'm Your Money" in his set. He told *This Is Not Retro* in 2008 that he thought it is one of Heaven 17's "best and most interesting tracks". In his 2009 book *Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984*, Simon Reynolds described the song as "brilliant" and noted that, like its predecessor "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang", it was "also something of a consciousness-raiser, transposing the language of business on to love and marriage à la Gang of Four's 'Contract'."
