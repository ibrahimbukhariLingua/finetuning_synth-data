Continuously compounded nominal and real returns


# Continuously compounded nominal and real returns



**Return rate** is a corporate finance and accounting tool which calculates the gain and loss of investment over a certain period of time.


## Nominal return

Let *P*ₜ be the price of a security at time *t*, including any cash dividends or interest, and let *P*ₜ − ₁ be its price at *t* − 1. Let *RS*ₜ be the simple rate of return on the security from *t* − 1 to *t*. Then

The continuously compounded rate of return or instantaneous rate of return *RCₜ* obtained during that period is

If this instantaneous return is received continuously for one period, then the initial value *P*ₜ-₁ will grow to {\displaystyle P\_{t}=P\_{t-1}\cdot e^{RC\_{t}}} during that period. See also continuous compounding.

Since this analysis did not adjust for the effects of inflation on the purchasing power of *P*ₜ, *RS* and *RC* are referred to as nominal rates of return.


## Real return

Let {\displaystyle \pi \_{t}} be the purchasing power of a dollar at time *t* (the number of bundles of consumption that can be purchased for $1). Then {\displaystyle \pi \_{t}=1/(PL\_{t})}, where *PL*ₜ is the price level at *t* (the dollar price of a bundle of consumption goods). The simple inflation rate *IS*ₜ from *t* –1 to *t* is {\displaystyle {\tfrac {PL\_{t}}{PL\_{t-1}}}-1}. Thus, continuing the above nominal example, the final value of the investment expressed in real terms is

Then the continuously compounded real rate of return {\displaystyle RC^{real}} is

The continuously compounded real rate of return is just the continuously compounded nominal rate of return minus the continuously compounded inflation rate.
