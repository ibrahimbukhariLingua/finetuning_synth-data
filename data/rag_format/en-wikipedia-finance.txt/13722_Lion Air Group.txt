# Lion Air Group



**PT Lion Group**, dba **Lion Air Group**, is a privately owned, airline holding company, based in Indonesia. The group consists of several airlines from Southeast Asia, currently Lion Air, Wings Air, Batik Air, Batik Air Malaysia, Thai Lion Air, and Super Air Jet. The Lion Air Group primarily competes with the Malaysian-based low-cost carrier AirAsia, Vietnamese-based low-cost carrier VietJet Air, and domestic competitor and national airline Garuda Indonesia.


## History

The airline group is founded on the success of Lion Air, which was founded in 1999. With the growth of aviation and travel within Indonesia, Lion Air founded Wings Air in 2003, a regional carrier wholly owned by Lion Air.


### Regional expansion

With the expansion of regional rival AirAsia into the Indonesian aviation market, the Lion Group established Malindo Air in 2012, to compete with AirAsia in the Malaysian aviation market. The airline's name derived from a combination of the countries Malaysia and Indonesia.

Local competition from national airline Garuda Indonesia also arose in 2012, as Garuda announced intentions to form an off-shoot of its Citilink brand into its own low-cost carrier. Further intentions to expand Citilink were announced, such that it could compete with Lion Air in the domestic low-cost travel market. In response, Lion Group announced a full-service competitor to Garuda Indonesia in the form of Batik Air.

To further expand into the region, Lion Air announced its intention to launch Thai Lion Air, based in Bangkok, Thailand. This would allow the group to further encroach on AirAsia's market share, as well as compete with local low-cost carrier Nok Air.

In 2017, the Lion Air Group managed to surpass 50% market share domestically for the first time.

In 2021, after the launch of Super Air Jet, rumors arose that the airline belonged to Lion Air Group after the airline was headed by Ari Azhari, a former General Manager of Services for Lion Air Group. The airline however rejected any claims of formal ties with Lion Air and its subsidiaries.
