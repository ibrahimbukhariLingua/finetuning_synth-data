Commission on Filipinos Overseas


# Commission on Filipinos Overseas



The **Commission on Filipinos Overseas** (**CFO**) (Filipino: *Komisyon sa mga Pilipino sa Ibayong Dagat*) is an agency of the government of the Philippines under the Office of the President of the Philippines. CFO was established on June 16, 1980, through the enactment of Batas Pambansa Blg. 79.

The agency is responsible for promoting and upholding the interests of Filipino emigrants and Filipino permanent residents in countries other than The Philippines. It is also responsible for preserving and strengthening ties with Filipino communities outside the Philippines. It is headed by a Chairperson who is bestowed with a Cabinet rank of Secretary.


## History

The evolution of the Commission on Filipinos Overseas can be traced with the passage of Presidential Decree No. 442 (Labor Code of the Philippines), which was enacted in 1974, creating the Office of Emigrant Affairs, along with the Overseas Employment Development Board (now POEA) among other offices created.

The following years were characterized by a steady increase in migration, thus making it necessary to establish an independent unit that would constitute a local support network solely for Filipino emigrants.

In June 1980, Batas Pambansa Blg. 79 was enacted to strengthen the government’s policy on the promotion of migrant welfare and interest. It created the Commission on Filipinos Overseas which replaced OEA but retained and further expanded its mandate. The decree specifically identified Filipino emigrants as the recipients of its services.
