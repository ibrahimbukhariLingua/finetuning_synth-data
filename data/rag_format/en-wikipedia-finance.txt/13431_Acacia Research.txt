Stewart founded the business with the intention of using investment capital for innovation. In 2000, under the leadership of Paul Ryan and Chip Harris, it moved to concentrate on technology backed by strong patents. Acacia’s operations have since expanded into three verticals: Intellectual Property Operations, which includes patent licensing, enforcement and technologies business; Energy Operations; and Industrial Operations.

In the second quarter of 2024, the company’s total revenues were $25.8 million, up 227% compared to $7.9 million in the same quarter of 2023. This was composed of $5.3 million generated by the company’s Intellectual Property business, $6.3 million by Printronix and $14.2 million by Benchmark Energy.

The company’s principal executive office is in New York City.


## Legal issues

Four months after Apple Computer filed an antitrust lawsuit against Acacia for conspiring with Nokia to extort exorbitant revenues from handset manufacturers, in 2017 Acacia sued Apple Computer and some cellular carriers over four patents held by Nokia.

In 2022, an internal investigation by Acacia found that former CEO Clifford Press had possibly abused corporate funds. Press sued Acacia in response, demanding to be put back on Acacia's board and threatening public attacks to gain a lucrative severance package. The misconduct was confirmed in early 2023.
