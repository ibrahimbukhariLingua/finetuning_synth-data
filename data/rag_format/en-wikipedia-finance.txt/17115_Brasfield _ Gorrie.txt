## History

Founded as the **Thomas C. Brasfield Company** by its namesake in 1921, the company originally performed small commercial and remodeling projects. The company continued in this market until it was acquired in 1964 by Miller Gorrie, who changed the company's name to Brasfield & Gorrie in 1967. As the company grew, Gorrie moved its focus to larger commercial, industrial, and institutional projects. Brasfield & Gorrie expanded its operations in the late 1960s and early 1970s to include high-rise and specialty concrete structures, and expanded further in 1977 to include infrastructure projects, including water and sewage treatment plants. The company diversified into the healthcare industry in 1969 and has continued to the present day. In 1985, Brasfield & Gorrie created two new regions of operation by opening offices in Atlanta, Georgia and Orlando, Florida. It has additional offices in Raleigh, North Carolina, Nashville, Tennessee, Jacksonville, Florida, Dallas, Texas, and Columbus, Georgia. Brasfield & Gorrie has grown in contract revenues from less than $1 million in its first year of operation in 1964 to nearly $5 billion in 2022.
