## Early life and education

Upon returning to Iran in 1978, he joined Abureyhan University, which was later integrated with various other universities and institutions to establish Alameh Tabatabaei University after the Islamic Revolution.


## Career

Behkish's career was formed in an environment in which his business experiences complemented his academic work in the university. He began his various positions in different Chamber in Iran with a consultative position, before being raised sharply to higher positions such as Secretary General of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Vice Chairman & S.G. of ICC in Iran, and President of Iran-Italy Chamber (for which he received Knight of the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity (cavaliere) from the President of State of Italy in 2009).

Behkish is among a few economists whose advice is well considered in both the Private Sector and Public Sector. He strongly believes in market economy, and has pushed strongly for joining Iran to WTO before it became almost impossible. He has tried continuously to push the government to liberalize the economy, using his seat in the University or his official positions in chambers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Due to Behkish's work with the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) for more than 25 years, he is well aware of the benefits of globalization, and hence, in addition to writing his books on such related subjects, he kept a window open in the country to connect interested businessman to international business communities.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
