## Lobbying for leaseholder reform

Southam is known as a consumer and leaseholder advocate through industry and Government campaigns to license managing agents and to make them more accountable, thereby protecting the rights of homeowners and leaseholders.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Before the 2010 UK election, Southam's campaign ran alongside the work of groups such as the Campaign Against Retired Leaseholder Exploitation (CARLEX), Property Standards Board (PBS) and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

He was appointed as non-executive chair of the government-funded Leasehold Advisory Service (LEASE) in December 2014. Since then his suitability for the role has been questioned, for example see Private Eye No 1448, 27 July 2017, page 37 "Going Southam".

In February 2017, Justin Madders MP (Labour, Ellesmere Port and Neston) questioned Mr Southam's suitability in parliament for the role.

In October 2017, Sir Peter Bottomley (Conservative, Worthing West) asked Housing Minister Alok Sharma: "Will the Minister please give serious consideration to whether the chairman of LEASE—the leasehold advisory service—can properly remain in his role, or whether it would be better to let him retire and have him replaced?"
