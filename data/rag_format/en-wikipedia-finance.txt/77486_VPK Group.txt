## History

VPK Group was founded in 1936 by Omer Macharis as a paper factory in Oudegem, Belgium. It was later renamed as the United Paper and Board Mills (VPK). After World War II, Fernand Macharis became the head of the company.

In the early 1990s, Pierre Macharis and his brother assumed management of the company from their father, Fernand Macharis.

In 1999, VPK underwent an initial public offering, raising 50 million euros, and was listed on the Brussels Stock Exchange. The funding was used to expand production capacity at the Uniwell corrugated cardboard factory in Raamsdonkveer, Netherlands. During the same period, the company increased its shareholding in the Northern French packaging group, Ondulys and acquired Rigid Group in the UK.

In 2005, VPK expanded its operations into Poland and Romania.

In 2010, VPK acquired Mondi Packaging Saint Quentin, a French corrugated cardboard company, for 20 million euros. Following this acquisition, the company was renamed Ondulys Saint Quentin, aligning with VPK's French corrugated cardboard division.

In 2011, VPK invested 30 million euros in a joint venture, constructing a factory in Leinefelde, Germany.

In 2013, VPK, in a joint venture with Klingele, acquired the UPM Stracel factory in France from UPM.

In 2015, VPK invested 6.5 million euros in a facility in Courcelles, Wallonia, naming the subsidiary Cartonneries de Wallonie.

In 2016, VPK acquired Peterson Packaging, which operated six factories in Scandinavia. As a result, VPK became a packaging supplier for IKEA.

In 2019, VPK acquired the European and Chinese operations of Corenso from NPAC International. As a result of this acquisition, VPK expanded its operations into China.

In 2022, VPK repurposed the Alizay Double A Paper factory in Normandy to produce lightweight recycled containerboard and e-commerce packaging.

In 2023, VPK acquired Arteche Paper, again through its subsidiary Corex.
