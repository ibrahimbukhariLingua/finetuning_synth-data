Galileo Global Education


# Galileo Global Education



**Galileo Global Education S.A.** is Europe’s largest for-profit higher education provider, with over 200 private colleges (or *écoles*), universities and campuses around the world and its head office in Paris, France. It claims to be number one in Europe, but ranks behind Chinese groups such as TAL Education Group and New Oriental worldwide.

The company owns and operates several higher-learning institutions, including the Regent's University London, the Macromedia University, the Paris School of Business, the Istituto Marangoni or the European University Cyprus, and almost 40% of EM Lyon Business School.


## History


### 2011: Creation of the group by US fund Providence Equity

Galileo Global Education was created when the American investment fund Providence Equity acquired Istituto Marangoni (Italy) in 2011, and began to expand by acquiring public schools from a variety of backgrounds in France, Germany, Mexico and elsewhere. At the same time, Studialis, a French higher education group, is expanding and acquiring schools in a range of sectors: management, IT, arts and crafts, etc.


### 2016: acquisition of Studialis

In 2016, Galileo Global Education acquired Studialis, formerly Eductis, for €250 million. Studialis will be renamed Galileo Global Education France in July 2023.

In April 2018, Téthys Invest, a subsidiary of the Bettencourt Meyers family's holding company, became a reference shareholder in the Galileo Global Education group and sits on the Board of Directors alongside the American investment fund Providence Equity, the majority shareholder.


### 2020: sale to the Bettencourt Meyers family and Bpifrance

On 13 February 2020, US investment fund Providence Equity announced the sale of its majority stake in the Galileo Global Education group for an estimated €2.3 billion. The Group was sold in March 2020 to a shareholder group comprising Téthys Invest, the holding company of the Bettencourt-Meyers family, Bpifrance, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Montagu Private Equity. The group is managed by international investment funds.

In 2020, Galileo Global Education acquires Regent's University London.

In 2021, the Group acquired IPETH, a physiotherapy school in Mexico, as well as LMA and Health Events, and created the Eva Santé school in France, a training institute for care assistants.

In 2022, Galileo Global Education created ELIJE, a law school in Paris, and acquired AKAD University in Germany and TAI School of Arts in Spain. That same year, the Group acquired a 40% stake in EM Lyon Business School, consistently ranked among the best business schools in Europe.

### Business model

The international investment funds that are shareholders in Galileo Global Education are aiming for financial profitability in a market that was structured in the 2000s and is still perceived as profitable, and even as promising. While Bpifrance's (the French Public Investment Bank) support for the group does not allow it to influence its strategy, it does provide shareholders with an incentive.

The Group's use of online training, as with its subsidiary *Studi*, guarantees high profitability, since the formula saves on premises and reduces the number of teachers.

Sociologist and economist Aurélien Casta estimated in 2022 that families know little or nothing about the role of investment funds in private colleges (*écoles*) and *grandes écoles* in France, despite the fact that the country is one of the most developed in terms of private for-profit higher education.

Its competitors in France include the Ionis Education Group and Omnes Education groups.

## Lobbying

Galileo Global Education has been registered as an interest representative with the Haute Autorité pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique since February 2021. In 2022, the company will declare expenses of less than €50,000 for this activity.


## Controversial issues

In February 2023, the group was the target of an investigation by the French newspaper *Libération* into ‘*the underbelly of an educational business that prospers thanks to the laissez-faire attitude of the state*’.

In 2024, the French public television channel France 2's programme Complément d'Enquête gave the floor to a Galileo executive who said that financial interests were more important than educational ones. The report also examines the links between Muriel Pénicaud and the group, with the former French Minister for Employment now a board member.
