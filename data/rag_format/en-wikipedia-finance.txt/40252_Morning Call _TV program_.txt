Morning Call (TV program)


# Morning Call (TV program)



***Morning Call*** is an American TV business program that aired on CNBC, from 10AM to 12 noon ET weekdays. The show premiered as *Midday Call* on February 4, 2002, offered a clear focus on real-time market coverage at the heart of the trading day. Previous programs shown in the same time slot were *The Money Wheel* with Ted David and Martha MacCallum (who later joined Fox News Channel) and *Market Watch*. The program last aired August 8, 2007.


## About the program

On February 3, 2006, Ted David, who had co-anchored *Morning Call* with Liz Claman since 2003, left the program while being promoted to senior anchor at CNBC Business Radio. From 2006-02-06 to 2007-07-17, Claman was joined in the 10-11am hour by Mark Haines (who reported from the New York Stock Exchange), and in the 11am-noon hour by various anchors, including Dylan Ratigan (see anchor roster below).

On July 20, 2007, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded *Squawk on the Street*, due in part to Claman's departure from the network (which she joined Fox News Channel's sister network financial unit three months later). Dylan Ratigan and Trish Regan served as interim anchors for the program, which was completely revamped on 2007-07-23. In addition to the aforementioned 2007-07-23 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to *Squawk Box*.

On August 8, 2007, the show was renamed—and replaced—by *The Call*. The name change to *The Call* with Dylan Ratigan (who left the show in late 2008 and was replaced by Larry Kudlow), Melissa Francis, and Trish Regan on that date was due in part to avoid confusion with the early-morning Bloomberg Television program of the same name.
