Nominal fee


# Nominal fee



A **nominal fee** refers to a sale of a good or service for far less than it is actually worth, when it cannot be given away for free. Typically, such a sale will be for the smallest full denomination of a currency (for example, one dollar). Nominal fees are necessary when contracts are signed, since in order for a contract to be valid, some form of payment must be involved.


## Examples

In 2006, the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway sold a 135 mile long rail line to Tshiuetin Rail Transportation for $1. Tshiuetin was formed by several First Nations communities to continue railroad service on the line, which formerly was used for transporting minerals.
