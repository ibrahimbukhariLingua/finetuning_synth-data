Davidson Media Group


# Davidson Media Group



The **Davidson Media Group** (DMG) is a Charlotte-based broadcaster specializing in multi-cultural, community focused formats. The company runs stations in a number of markets in 10 states and also specializes in selling large blocks of time on some of its stations to brokers who broadcast Spanish and/or urban contemporary gospel programs. Despite the minority-focus of DMG's market, the company itself is not minority-owned and is controlled through two private equity groups, CapStreet II LP and Citigroup Venture Capital.

Felix Perez was at one time DMG's president and chief executive officer; by January 2012, Perez had been named as the general manager for Univision Radio.

On February 13, 2009, SS Broadcasting Holdings (SSH) announced that it was purchasing Davidson Media Group for $1,000 cash and assumption of debt. This transaction placed SSH in control of 43 stations previously licensed to DMG.


## Organization

The structure of the Group was quite complicated and prone to change as properties are acquired and divested. For instance, an example from 2005 shows that Davidson Media Group has among subsidiaries Davidson Media Holding Corp. and Davidson Media Holding Sub Corp., which together own Davidson Media Carolinas Stations LLC, which in turn owns Davidson Media Station WOLI Licensee LLC, the former license holder of WOLI-FM of Easley, South Carolina.


## Stations

As of mid-2007ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Davidson Media operated over 40 stations in 17 states.

* WCVG/1320 AM: Covington, Kentucky; acquired July 16, 2006 for $1.9 million and converted to a Spanish language station.
