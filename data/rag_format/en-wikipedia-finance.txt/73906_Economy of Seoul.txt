The Downtown Seoul, which has 600 hundred years of history as unparalleled business district in entire Korea, is now a densely concentrated area around Gwanghwamun and Cheonggyecheon with headquarters of major companies, foreign financial institutions, largest news agencies and law firms. Other two business districts are developed in 1970s and have different characteristic; while Gangnam is well known for tech, luxury and private education industries, Yeouido is famous for securities exchange and asset management.

As significant portion of South Korean economy is propelled by manufacturing and tech firms, office market in Seoul is not driven by FIRE companies. Rather, diverse industries creates demand for office in central business districts in Seoul. This characteristic is most clearly evident in Downtown Seoul, where most of foreign companies headquarters South Korean branch office regardless of their industry. Meanwhile, Gangnam office market is also sustained by diverse industries, yet most of its components come from tech and luxury retails.

In 2023, the city announced plans to invest $44.7 million over six years to create a dedicated area to attract foreign investment.

Seoul's nowadays competency in financial industry is mainly found in Yeouido, which is often named as Wall Street of South Korea. Although history of Yeouido got started in 1979 when the national government relocated Korea Stock Exchange out from Downtown Seoul, its distinct fame as financial district of the whole nation started later in 1990s, when South Korea started deregulating stock market to attract foreign investments.

Yet it is notifiable that major functions as financial district are still distributed among big three business districts, as Yeouido leads, Downtown Seoul follows, and Gangnam is in the last. In 2022 survey of the Seoul Institute, about 40% of entire financial institutions were settled in Yeouido. However, its composition was heavily concentrated to native firms on stock brokerage and asset management. Other sectors, such as banking, insurance and credit cards, were found mostly concentrated in Downtown Seoul. Also, most of foreign stock brokerage firms settled in Downtown Seoul. Meanwhile, Gangnam had its distinct competency in fintech start-ups and real estate firms.²⁰–²²
