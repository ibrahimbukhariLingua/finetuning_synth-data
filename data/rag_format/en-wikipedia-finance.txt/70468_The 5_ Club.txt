The 5% Club


# The 5% Club



**The 5% Club** is a movement of employers working to create a shared prosperity across the UK by campaigning for greater skills training, through ‘earn and learn’ job opportunities.


## History

The 5% Club was founded by Leo Quinn in 2013.

Its stated purpose is to address the high levels of youth unemployment and chronic skills shortage in today's society, by "inspiring positive employer action for increased, accessible and inclusive workplace learning opportunity for all". Its Executive Team are increasingly working with government to provide a bridge between the corporate and public sector, with Members of Parliament describing it as the 'gold standard' for businesses supporting skill development. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has also endorsed The 5% Club and upon its launch, publicly urged British industry to strive to commit to the 5% employment target.

In 2018, The 5% Club gained charitable status.


## Membership

As of February 2024 The 5% Club has more than 1,000 members. They are UK companies wishing to invest in skills creation and employability. Members of The Club pledge to have at least 5% of its employees in earn and learn roles within 5-years of joining.. Members are required to publish an annual report on their progress.
