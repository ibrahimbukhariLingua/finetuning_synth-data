## History

Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, with an initial capital of $250. It was registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981. In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore.

The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and became Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992.

In February 1993, Infosys launched its initial public offering (IPO) with an offer price of ₹95 per share, compared to a book value of ₹20 per share. The IPO was initially undersubscribed but was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which acquired a 13% equity stake at the offer price. When trading began in June 1993, the share price opened at ₹145 per share.

Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American depositary receipts (ADRs), making it the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The share price rose to ₹8,100 by 1999, making it the most expensive share on the market at the time. Infosys was then among the top 20 companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. The ADR listing was later transferred from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to provide European investors with better access to the company's shares.

In July 2010, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Infosys headquarters in Bangalore and addressed the company's employees. In June 2011, the company was renamed Infosys Limited.

In 2012, Infosys announced the opening of a new office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to serve Harley-Davidson. In 2011, Infosys hired 1,200 U.S. employees, and by 2012, it had expanded its workforce by an additional 2,000 employees.

In July 2014, Infosys launched a product subsidiary named EdgeVerve Systems, focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement, and commerce network domains. In August 2015, Infosys transferred assets of Finacle to EdgeVerve Systems.

Infosys surpassed US$10 million in annual revenue in FY 1995, US$100 million in FY 1999, US$1 billion in FY 2004, and US$10 billion in FY 2017. In FY 2023, its revenue stood at US$18 billion.

Infosys announced the launch of Aster in June 2024, an AI-powered platform designed to improve marketing efficiency through the use of artificial intelligence.

## Controversies


### Settlement of tax fraud in the US

In December 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with the State of California in a visa and tax fraud case. Between 2006 and 2017, nearly 500 Infosys employees were found to be working in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas instead of the required H-1B visas, enabling the company to avoid paying California payroll taxes, including unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and employment training taxes.


### Accusation of visa fraud in the US

In 2011, Infosys was accused of visa fraud for using B-1 (visitor) visas for work that required H-1B (work) visas. The allegations originated from an internal complaint by an American employee of Infosys, who subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming harassment and marginalization after raising the issue. Although the lawsuit was dismissed, along with another similar case, these allegations were brought to the attention of U.S. authorities, leading to investigations by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury.

In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with U.S. authorities by paying $34 million. While the company did not admit guilt, it stated that it settled to avoid the complications of "prolonged litigation". Infosys asserted that, "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are untrue and are assertions that remain unproven."


### Malfunctioning government portals

In 2013, technical issues emerged after Infosys took over the MCA21 portal from Tata Consultancy Services. Similar problems arose in 2016 after a system migration and version update.

In 2020, the finance ministry identified glitches in the GSTN portal, leading to a summons for Infosys executives. In 2022, chartered accountants and tax professionals raised concerns over technical issues with the GSTN portal.

In 2021, the newly launched Income Tax portal, developed by Infosys, encountered multiple glitches. Despite a summons for Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, the issues remained unresolved for months, forcing an extension of the tax filing deadline. In 2022, users continued to report malfunctions and issues on the first anniversary of the portal's launch.
