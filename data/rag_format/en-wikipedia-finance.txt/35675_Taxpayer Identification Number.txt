Taxpayer Identification Number


# Taxpayer Identification Number



A **Taxpayer Identification Number** (**TIN**) is an identifying number used for tax purposes in the United States and in other countries under the Common Reporting Standard. In the United States it is also known as a **Tax Identification Number** (**TIN**) or **Federal Taxpayer Identification Number** (**FTIN**). A TIN may be assigned by the Social Security Administration (SSA) or by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).


## Types

Any government-provided number that can be used in the US as a unique identifier when interacting with the IRS is a TIN, though none of them are referred to exclusively as a Taxpayer Identification Number. A TIN may be:

* a Social Security number (SSN)
* an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
* an Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a FEIN (Federal Employer Identification Number)
* an Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN), used as a temporary number for a child for whom the adopting parents cannot obtain an SSN
* a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN), used by paid preparers of US tax returns

### SSNs

SSNs are used by people who have or had the right to work in the United States.


### ITINs

ITINs are used by aliens who may or may not have the right to work in the US, such as aliens on temporary visas and non-resident aliens with US income.


### EINs

EINs are used by employers, sole proprietors, corporations, LLCs, partnerships, non-profit associations, trusts, estates of decedents, government agencies, certain individuals, and other business entities.
