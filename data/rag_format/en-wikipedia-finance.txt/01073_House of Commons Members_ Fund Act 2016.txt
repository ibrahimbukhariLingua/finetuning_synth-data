# House of Commons Members' Fund Act 2016



The **House of Commons Members' Fund Act 2016** (c. 18) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, introduced under the Ten Minute Rule by Sir Paul Beresford, to consolidate the provisions of the House of Commons Members' Fund.


## Background

The House of Commons Members' Fund (HCMF) was established in 1939, before a pension scheme was established in 1964, to help former Members and their dependants who had financial difficulty.


## Provisions

The Act repealed the following Acts of Parliament:

* House of Commons Members' Fund Act 1939 – (established the fund)
* House of Commons Members' Fund Act 1948 – (extended assistance to widowers)
* House of Commons Members' Fund Act 1957 – (created Treasury contributions to the fund)
* House of Commons Members' Fund Act 1962
* House of Commons Members' Fund and Parliamentary Pensions Act 1981 – (created pensions for certain former members)
* Parliamentary Pensions etc. Act 1984 (section 12)
* Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act 1991 (section 7)

The Act empowers trustees to cease requiring contributions from Members (which was previously £2 per member per month) and to return surplus funds to HM Treasury. It also extend the class of beneficiaries to assist all dependants of former Members who experience severe hardship. It would also allow one of the trustees to be a former MP.
