# Replicon (company)



**Replicon** is a Calgary-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that makes software for time tracking, advanced project management, task collaboration, resource allocation, and professional services automation. Its online timesheets and cloud clock are an alternative to paper timesheets or punch cards.

On August 23, 2023, Deltek announced that it had completed the acquisition of the company.


## History

Replicon was co-founded in 1996 by Raj Narayanaswamy and Lakshmi Raj in Calgary, Canada. The company expanded its presence globally over the years and has set up major offices in other countries.

The founders reckoned that simple everyday processes like time sheet management and expense reports cause major problems and hence went about building web-based applications to relieve the stress on businesses and optimize workforce productivity.

As of March 2022, it reportedly has over 2500 B2B customers in 80+ countries, and has more than 600 employees across Australia, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Three months after an agreement between the parties was reported, Replicon completed its purchase in August 2023 to Deltek.
