## Company history


### Inception

The company was initially founded in 2011 as *Overseas Student Living* by Luke Nolan. After working in China for several years, Nolan was regularly called upon by his Chinese friends to help recommend accommodation for students looking to study in the US, UK and Australia. Recognizing that many other individuals, especially students, were facing similar issues, Nolan realized that there was a potential market for an online student accommodation marketplace that could help in connecting students with trusted professional landlords for their accommodation needs. In 2014, he was joined by other co-founders Shakil Khan, who met Nolan 10-years earlier in Shanghai, and John-Paul Jones. The company rebranded itself as Student.com in 2015 to focus on expanding globally and hired a team of multilingual booking agents.


### Growth and funding

In 2015, the company saw $110 million in bookings, listed properties in 426 cities in proximity to 1,000 universities. The company raised combined Series B and C funding of $60 million in 2016 led by VY Capital, Horizons Ventures, Expa, Spotify founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, and Hugo Barra of Xiaomi.
