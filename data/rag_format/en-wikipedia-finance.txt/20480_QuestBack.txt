## History


### Launch & the early years (1999-2005)

The idea for Questback was sparked in 1999 by an article in the Financial Times. The company launched in 2000 with the goal of creating a feedback platform to bring better insights to business. The company's web-based surveys help eliminate the need to execute paper-based surveys for its customers. In 2004, the company expanded to Sweden, and then 11 other European countries in 2005.


### Company evolution (2006-2011)

In 2006, Questback was recognized as *Norway’s Entrepreneur of the Year*, kicking off years of growth for the company. The company acquired Refleks and Easy Research in Norway and Sweden in 2006, and then Digium OY in 2010. Finally, the company acquired Germany's leading online survey SaaS vendor Globalpark AG in 2011.

Norwegian private equity firm Reitan & Co became the company's majority owner in 2006.


### U.S. expansion (2012-Present)

In January 2012, Questback opened a North American office in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to serve as the basis for an expansion into the U.S. market. The move into the U.S. enabled the company to serve new and existing North American customers.

Since 2012, the company has created a number of offices in North America including New York City, Austin and Houston.
