## History

Park National Bank was founded in July 1908 under the name The Park National Bank of Newark. The organization changed its name to Park National Bank in 1971 shortly after acquiring The People's State Bank. The company then acquired The Utica Savings Bank Company in 1973, followed by The Fairfield National Bank of Lancaster.

During the housing crisis of the early 2000s, Park National acquired nine other banks in a three year period. Most of these acquisitions happened within the 2008 fiscal year, which was the peak of the crisis. The company managed to acquire seven different banks in 2008. The next acquisition for the corporation was NewDominion Bank, which brought Park National into the North Carolina area. One of their affiliates has also recently announced plans to build a location in Kentucky.

Carolina Alliance Bank was the latest bank to join the organization expanding the region into South Carolina. The Park National Family of Banks is now operating in 28 counties in Ohio, one in Kentucky, one in North Carolina, and two in South Carolina. There are 110 branches located in Ohio.

At the beginning of 2020, Park National Bank changed the names of all affiliate banks to Park National Bank. Chairman and CEO, David Trautman, reported that unifying the various affiliates under one name allows for 'smart, steady growth, with expanded resources to better serve the customers'. Services and employees did not change, however a new, more modern, logo was chosen using colors from some of the affiliate bank's brands.
