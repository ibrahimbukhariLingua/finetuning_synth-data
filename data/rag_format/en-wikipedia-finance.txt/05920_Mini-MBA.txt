Mini-MBA


# Mini-MBA



A **Mini-MBA** is a high value advanced training regimen focused on the fundamentals of business management and leadership skills. The program provides an introductory insight into business, preparing students as well as professionals for what might be a further exploration, or just a foundational understanding of the area.

While it is named as "Mini-MBA", it is generally considered as **Equivalent** as a "**shorter**" and more "**practical**" version of an **Executive MBA** designed for Management professionals or Business Executives within an organization, it is not to be confused with the MBA degree.

Some of the exceptions are RWTH AACHEN Business School and Harvard GSAS where the “Mini MBA” is just a smaller version of the traditional MBA degree and does carry academic benefits.


## Curriculum

Mini-MBA programs typically cover all the content topics of traditional MBAs such as accounting, business communication, business ethics, finance, managerial economics, management, leadership, agile, AI, entrepreneurship, marketing, operations, and strategic management.

In addition to the general Mini-MBA programs where the program covers general business concepts, some colleges offer Mini-MBA specializations in areas such as social media marketing, digital marketing and sustainable innovation.

The Harvard GSAS Mini MBA, (as it is a smaller version of HBS MBA) uses the “case-method” teaching which is very common at Harvard business courses.
