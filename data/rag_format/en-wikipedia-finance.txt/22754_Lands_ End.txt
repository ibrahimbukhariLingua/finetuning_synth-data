## History

Lands' End began as a mail-order yachting supply company in 1963 in Chicago. It was founded by Gary Comer, along with his partners, 1963 Pan American Games gold medalist sailors Richard Stearns and Robert Halperin, and two of Stearns' employees.

In 1978, it expanded into general clothing and home furnishings, and moved to Dodgeville, Wisconsin.

In October 1986, it became a public company via an initial public offering.

In the late 1980s, Lands' End was the jersey supplier of the United States national rugby union team.

In July 1995, the company launched its website, Landsend.com.

In 2002, Sears, Roebuck and Company acquired the company for $2Â billion in cash. Sears offered products by Lands' End in many of its retail stores, until 2019.

In November 2009, Lands' End launched Lands' End Canvas, which offered a more fashion-oriented selection of casual clothing for men and women. It was discontinued in 2013. The line was reintroduced in 2016 but cancelled in 2017 by the new CEO.

## Controversies

In 2016, feminist activist Gloria Steinem was featured in the catalog of Lands' End. After an outcry from anti-abortion customers, the company removed Steinem from its website. The company then faced further criticism, this time both from customers who were still unhappy that Steinem had been featured in the first place, and customers who were unhappy that Steinem had been removed.
