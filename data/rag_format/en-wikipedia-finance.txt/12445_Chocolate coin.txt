## United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, chocolate coins mimic the design of real money; they are traditionally bought around Christmas and are used to decorate the Christmas tree and to fill the stockings of children. When children visit a friend or relative they are allowed to find and take chocolates from the tree as a treat. A variant of this is that chocolate coins are hidden somewhere in the house for children to find, often in the form of a treasure trail.


## Hannukah Gelt

During the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, chocolate coins are sometimes given to children in addition or in replacement of the traditional gelt (gift of money), typically with a dreidel.


## Chinese New Year

For Chinese New Year, in place of traditional Hongbao or "lucky money", chocolate coins are sometimes now given.


## Chocolate coin collections

During "Festival Cuéntalo", held in Logroño in November 2022, the Norwegian non-profit organization "antipodes café" presented the exhibition illegal tender at Logroño City Hall, showcasing their collection of chocolate coins. This installation included hundreds of unique designs mimicking legal tender. However, in some cases, coins with fake or "fantastic" designs were included. For example Rubles with a butterfly on their obverse, or "Argentinian Besos" (instead of "Argentinian Pesos") were displayed at the aforementioned show. According to the authors, "(…) [the] *presentation* [of their chocolate coin collection] *is inspired by coin exhibitions, distancing this quotidian objects from their functionality and users, adding value —in the broadest sense of the term— through a distinguished position, flawless use of materials, lightning conditions, control of circulation, and additional information.*"


## Dĕūro

These Chocolate coins features the common face of the first edition of the 1 euro coin, while the reverse displays symbols of cocoa-producing countries, highlighting their independence from primary chocolate-producing and consuming nations. Each Dĕūro is made from uncertainly traced African cacao, which raises implications of forced and child labor, and is priced at a fixed rate of 1 euro. For its first edition of this conceptual artwork created by antipodes café, a total of 6,000 copies were minted in Madrid on October 12, 2022. In their reverse the featured the design of the ‘SUD’ coin of insurgent general José María Morelos. This Dĕūro was launched in November 2022 at the festival Cuéntalo in Logroño.
