Federation of Uganda Customs Agents & Freight Forwarders


# Federation of Uganda Customs Agents & Freight Forwarders



**FUCAFF** (Website) is the acronym for the **Federation of Uganda Customs Agents & Freight Forwarders**, an exclusive umbrella association for member clearing firms or companies registered in Uganda. With the slogan *Fostering Tax Compliance with Stakeholders*, it was formed in 2009 after UCIFA and its offshoot UFFA to coordinate with URA.


## Logistics

The federation's secretariat is based in Kinawataka, Kampala behind the Railway Crossing and fosters clearing and freight forwarding management within the Northern Corridor - the Busiest Transport Network in East Africa. With integrity as a vital component in leadership, it is mandatory for member companies of FUCAFF to be registered with Uganda Revenue Authority.
