Video games in the Netherlands


# Video games in the Netherlands



The Netherlands' mainstream video games market, not taking into consideration the serious and casual games, is the sixth largest in Europe. In 2008, the Dutch market took up 3.95% of the entire European market in total sales and 4.19% in software sales.

A significant part of the Netherlands' gaming industry is in serious games, in which Dutch companies make a significant part of the worldwide industry.

In the Netherlands, an estimated of 4,000 people are working in the games industry, at more than 600 companies. Over 45 of the companies are located in the Dutch Game Garden, a government subsidized organization with the aim of promoting and improving the video games industry in the Netherlands.


## Consumer availability

In 2007, the Dutch game industry surpassed the Dutch film industry for the first time in history. The growth of the games industry in the Netherlands is about 50% higher than any other industry in the Netherlands' region.

Despite the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, the situation of video gaming in the Netherlands is not all that bad. Both publishers and retailers report that the crisis has certainly not caused a drop in sales, while at times, sales have even improved.


### History

Although the first generation of video games were obtained by a select few, video games became first available during the second generation of video games, when a select few Dutch electronic stores carried the earlier systems. With the third generation, more stores started carrying video game related products, a trend that has been setting through ever since.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In the early '90s, independent video game stores first started to open in the Netherlands, with a fast expansion in the early 2000s. Since 2004, video games have gotten more important for general stores however, which has led to the closing of a number of game stores, and a merger of others.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Currently, there are about 1,200 stores, of which about 75 independent, in the Netherlands that carry video games and related items, and numerous online stores.


### Distribution

Distribution of games on physical media in the Netherlands is usually done by publishers or major distributors such as Micromedia BV in Nijmegen that cover the entire Benelux, although most of the publishers' offices are located in the Netherlands, and only a few have offices in Belgium. Since not every publisher has a separate office for the Benelux, certain publishers take care of multiple labels, including those of other publishers.

The Netherlands also has several publishers for games through digital distribution, such as via web portals and mobile platforms like the App Store and Google Play.


## Netherlands in video games

The Netherlands is not often used as a setting for video games, other than certain Dutch games such as *A2 Racer*, *AmsterDoom* (NL wiki) and *Efteling Tycoon*. Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, was planned to be a featured city in *The Getaway 3*, before its development was cancelled. The first internationally successful game to use the Netherlands as a setting is *Hitman: Codename 47*, which has a level set in Rotterdam. *Resistance: Retribution* also featured a level in Rotterdam. During World War II, the Netherlands was the location of Operation Market Garden, a much-used setting for World War II games. The game *Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway* focusses entirely on Operation Market Garden and accurately depicts the Dutch towns and landscape along the operation's route.

In games such as the FIFA football games and Olympic video games, teams or players from the Netherlands are featured. The TT Circuit Assen is by fans considered "The Cathedral" of motorcycling, with the Dutch TT being one of the biggest events in motorbike racing. As such, the track is featured in many of the motorcycling racing games. Circuit Park Zandvoort is a Formula One racing track. The track has been featured in its old Formula One-layout in the game *Grand Prix Legends*, and more recently in its current layout in *TOCA Race Driver*, *TOCA Race Driver 2*, *Race 07* and *rFactor 2*.

Recently Mario Kart Tour added an Amsterdam tour track to its roster.
