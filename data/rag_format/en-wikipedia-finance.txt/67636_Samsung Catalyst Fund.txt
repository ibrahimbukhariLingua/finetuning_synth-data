# Samsung Catalyst Fund



The **Samsung Catalyst Fund** (**SCF**) is the evergreen venture capital fund of Samsung Electronics. The fund invests in deep technology, artificial intelligence and big data startups. The fund's headquarters are located in San Jose, California, with offices in Seoul, Tel Aviv, and Paris.


## History

In February 2013, Samsung Electronics launched a new fully-owned investment fund, called the Samsung Catalyst Fund, or SCF. The announcement was made at an event in Menlo Park. The fund is distinct from Samsung's other investment arms, Samsung Ventures investments and Samsung NEXT.


## Approach

The fund has a multi-stage investment strategy and seeks to invest in startups in the data center, cloud computing, edge computing, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 5G, automotive technology, robotics and digital health spaces. Startups in the fund's portfolio are selected both for value creation and their potential creative impact on Samsung. The fund additionally looks for startups that provide support to Samsung's components business and semiconductor units, as well as a focus on cloud infrastructure and internet of things.

Alongside capital, the fund provides shared resources, networking, corporate development, and mentorship for its portfolio companies.
