## Mergers and Strategic Partnerships

G3 Telecom entered into an agreement with Telehop to sell its business services unit (PBX) in April 2013.

In December 2013, Telehop Communications Inc. (TSX-V: HOP) announced its expansion into Wireless Services by signing a Letter of Intent to acquire G3 Telecom’s businesses in the United States and the Philippines, as well as wireless telecommunications licenses for Huntsville, Dawson Creek, British Columbia and Ontario. Mr. Rajan Arora, the CEO of G3, will join the board of Telehop on completion of the acquisition.

In May 2014, Telehop Communications Inc. acquired the business assets of iRoam Mobile Solutions Inc., a Canadian company that operates under the iRoam and Brightroam brands in North America. The company provides global cellular phone communications services, SIM cards, roaming devices and worldwide Wi-Fi roaming solutions that are sold directly and through distributors for use around the world.
