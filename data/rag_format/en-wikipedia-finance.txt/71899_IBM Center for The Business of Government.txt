## History

The Center was established in 1998 as the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Endowment for The Business of Government. In 2002, IBM acquired the management consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and the Center was renamed. Since 2012, the Center has been led by Executive Director Dan Chenok, a former career federal executive for information policy and technology at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).


## Research and publications

> "Unlike traditional scholarly outlets, the IBM Center makes explicitly clear that its reports are to be ‘written for government executives and managers’ and that in making the decision to fund research proposals, it looks for very practical findings and recommendations—not just theory and concepts—in order to assist executives and managers to more effectively respond to mission and management challenges."

Since its inception, the center has published more than 250 research reports and books in areas such as public sector management and performance, technology and innovation, security and privacy, acquisition and procurement, and citizen engagement.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ Reports are commissioned through a competitive funding process which occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall.
