## Business life

Aban Pestonjee launched her business under the name Abans in 1968 at her home garage, where she managed to restore the used appliances she acquired from auctions and home sales to better working condition and sell them at her corner shop at Bambalapitiya, Galle Road. She came up with the idea to launch her own company at a time when Sri Lanka entered into the prospect of a closed economy in the 1960s, which also resulted in the subsequent ban on imports. Aban also took note of how difficult it was to complete household chores through manual labour due to restrictions imposed by Sri Lankan government on importing raw materials and cashed in on the potential by selling secondhand home appliances sourced through embassy auctions.

In 1978, the economy opened up and there was a large inflow of imported products. This led to an increased demand from the customers for quality global brands. First, she imported products from England, then from Thailand, China, Japan and Korea.

Abans Group is mainly divided into 5 business categories such as retail, services, logistics, manufacturing and real estate and infrastructure development under which come Abans (Pvt) Ltd, Abans automobile, Abans Abstract, S.A. Electricals (Pvt) Ltd Services, Abans Central AC Division, Abans Finance, Abans Tours, AB Securities (Pvt) Ltd etc.
