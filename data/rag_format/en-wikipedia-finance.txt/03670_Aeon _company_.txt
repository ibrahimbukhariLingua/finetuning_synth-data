# Aeon (company)



**Aeon Co., Ltd.** (イオン株式会社, *Ion Kabushiki gaisha*, [iꜜoɴ]; occasionally stylized as **ÆON**), formerly **Jusco Co., Ltd.** (ジャスコ株式会社, *Jasuko Kabushiki gaisha*), is a Japanese diversified retail holding company. It is one of the largest retail companies in Japan, owning **Aeon** hypermarkets, Aeon Mall and Aeon Town shopping malls, Daiei, MaxValu, Maruetsu, and My Basket supermarkets, Ministop convenience store, Welcia drugstore, and Aeon Cinema movie theaters.

Aeon traces its origins back to 1758 during the Edo period in Japan when it was established as a small sundry goods store called Shinohara-ya. Later, it was renamed Okada-ya after the founding family. In 1970, Okada-ya merged with several other companies it had established and became Jusco. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, Jusco expanded and in 2001 changed its name to Aeon, which was its own brand. In 2010, Aeon merged with its subsidiary retail companies and consolidated all its hypermarket brands such as Jusco and Saty under the Aeon name. In 2021, Aeon was reportedly the 17th largest retailer in the world in terms of revenue.


## Naming

The name Aeon is a transliteration from the koine Greek word ὁ αἰών (*ho aion*), from the archaic αἰϝών (*aiwon*). The name and symbolism used in the branding (i.e., aeon) implies the eternal nature of the company.


## History

**JUSCO** (ジャスコ, *Jasuko*) is the acronym for **Japan United Stores Company**, a chain of "general merchandise stores" (or hypermarket) and the largest of its type in Japan.

The company was legally incorporated in September 1926 as Okadaya (founded in 1758). In 1970, Okadaya merged with Futagi and Shiro to form Jusco Co., Ltd. The employees voted to name the company "Japan United Stores Company". The various Jusco companies are subsidiaries of the Aeon supermarket chain. The Jusco name was adopted from a company founded as a kimono silk trader in 1758. Renamed Aeon in 1989, it operates stores throughout Japan under Jusco and other names and also has a presence in Malaysia, Hong Kong, mainland China and Thailand.

Aeon took over the Japanese operations of Yaohan in December 1997.

On August 21, 2001, the company became Aeon Co., Ltd. The largest Jusco (also the largest single-building shopping center in Japan) opened in 2005 in Mito. On August 21, 2008, the corporate structure changed. Aeon Co., Ltd. became a holding company while Aeon Retail Co., Ltd. took over the retail operations formerly held by Aeon Co., Ltd.

As of March 1, 2011, all Jusco and SATY stores under the Aeon umbrella in Japan changed their names to Aeon while all the Jusco stores and shopping centres in Malaysia have been fully re-branded into Aeon since March 2012. The Hong Kong and Mainland China subsidiaries officially changed their name to Aeon on 1 March 2013.

### Malaysia

In 1983, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad met with Takuya Okada and thought that he should bring Japanese supermarkets to Malaysia. The Malaysian operations of Aeon started as a jointly-owned company with Cold Storage and three local companies, known as Jaya Jusco. It was the first time that a Japanese company had entered into a significant joint venture in the Malaysian retail industry.

The first Jusco store outside Japan was opened in the basement of Plaza Dayabumi, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1985.

Jusco assumed total operational control of the chain in 1988.

The oldest (though not the first) Jusco store in Malaysia is Jusco Taman Maluri located in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. It opened on 30 October 1989.

Aeon's third outlet in Malacca opened in 1991 while its fourth at Wangsa Maju (Alpha Angle) opened in April 1992.

Currently. there are 35 Aeon retail stores and shopping centres in operation throughout Malaysia.

Jusco in Malaysia is notable for being among the first general merchandise chains to introduce biodegradable polybags made from sweet potatoes.

In March 2012, all the Jusco stores and shopping centres in Malaysia were rebranded to Aeon, following the decision of Aeon in Japan. In November 2012, Aeon acquired the operation of Carrefour Malaysia with an enterprise value of €250 million. All of the current Carrefour hypermarkets and supermarkets in Malaysia were then fully re-branded into Aeon BiG. The acquisition of Carrefour Malaysia made Aeon as the second largest retailer in Malaysia, which combined the sales from Aeon Retail stores (formerly known as Jusco) and the former Carrefour outlets. Post-acquisition, Aeon's ASEAN business vice president said the retail giant targeted to open 100 outlets in various formats in the country by year 2020.

In April 2018, Aeon expanded to East Malaysia by opening their first mall in Kuching.
