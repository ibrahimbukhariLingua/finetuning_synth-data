### Author

Prins is the author of *All the Presidents' Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power*.

She authored a whistleblower book, *It Takes a Pillage: Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street*.

Prins's articles have appeared in *The New York Times*, *Fortune*, *Newsday*, *Mother Jones*, Slate.com, *The Guardian*, *The Nation*, *The American Prospect*, Alternet, *New York Daily News*, *La Vanguardia*, and other publications. She is a monthly contributor to Tom Dispatch where she offers analysis on the connections between Wall Street and Washington. Her latest book, *Permanent Distortion* was released in October 2022.
