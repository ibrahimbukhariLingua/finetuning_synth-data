Pro rata


# Pro rata



***Pro rata*** is an adverb or adjective meaning in equal portions or in proportion. The term is used in many legal and economic contexts. The hyphenated spelling ***pro-rata*** for the adjective form is common, as recommended for adjectives by some English-language style guides. In American English, this term has been vernacularized to ***prorated*** or ***pro-rated***.


## Meanings

More specifically, *pro rata* means:

* In proportionality to some factor that can be exactly calculated
* To count based on an amount of time that has passed out of the total time
* Proportional ratio

Pro rata has a Latin etymology, from *pro*, according to, for, or by, and *rata*, feminine ablative of calculated (rate or change).

### Insurance cancellation method

Calculation of return premium of a cancelled insurance policy is often done using a cancellation method called *pro rata*. First, a return premium factor is calculated by taking the number of days remaining in the policy period divided by the number of total days of the policy. This factor is then multiplied by the policy premium to arrive at the return premium. Traditionally, this has been done manually using a paper wheel calculator. Today, it is normally done using an online wheel calculator.
