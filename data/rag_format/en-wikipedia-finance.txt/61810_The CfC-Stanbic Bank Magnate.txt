# The CfC-Stanbic Bank Magnate



***The CfC-Stanbic Bank Magnate*** is a Kenyan business reality television show in which 14 participants compete in an elimination-style competition for a top prize of KSh.1.5 million/= (US$15,000) as seed capital for their business. The show typically ends with the 3 board members eliminating one of the contestants with the catch phrase, "You Have to Go!". The slogan of the show is "Winning is Just the Beginning".

The show first aired in October 27, 2011 and it's on its first season.


## Idea

*The CfC-Stanbic Bank Magnate* is a reality television show that starts with a group of participants vying to earn a top prize of KSh.1.5 million/= (US$15,000) as seed capital for their business idea. The participants are drawn from diverse backgrounds and regions across Kenya. During the show, these contestants live in close quarters testing their social skills as they balance co-operation with competition. The participants are placed into teams, and each week are assigned a task and required to select a team leader for the task. The winning team advances to the next task, while the losing team remains in the boardroom where the board members determine the person to go and is automatically eliminated from the show.

Eliminations involves the losing team being confronted with their loss in a boardroom meeting. The team leader is then asked to select one of their team members who was the weakest link. The board members then determine who has to go as well as put on probation participants whom they believe underperformed in the task assigned.

The board members reserves the right at times to do the following: not allow the losing team leader to determine who has to go, and to let go multiple people who were on probation from the previous task and performed poorly on the task assigned. The board members also discourage quitting.

## Episode 2

The 14 participants chosen are introduced to the board members where they are given 2 minutes to present their idea briefly. At the mansion, they trained on disaster management, team building and entrepreneurial mentoring classes. They were divided to 2 teams namely

**Team Deli fresh**

Members

1. Anne Githu - Team Leader
2. David Kamunde Mwirigi
3. Kenneth Ng'enoh
4. Lina Marie
5. Peter Ruhiu Njogu
6. Ryan Johnstone
7. William Waweru

The first task required the contestants to supplying fresh produce to Tuskys Supermarket in Nairobi. They were to go to the local market and purchase various fresh produce requires by their customer (supermarket manager) then sell to him at a profit. The team with the highest profits margins wins. They were then to prepare a report on the task assigned to them at the boardroom where the board members were to assess and determine the winner. The task tested on Time Management, Profitability, Ethics and Compliance with the Law, Pricing and Crisis Management. Team Deli fresh had some of the products rejected due to poor packing while Team Ultimate managed to sell all their produce. In the Board room, it was a straight victory for Team Ultimate with a profit margin of 10% while Team Deli Fresh made a loss of over KSh.1,200/=. The board members were not impressed by the 10% profit margin made by Team Ultimate but in the end it was Team Deli Fresh that had to lose one member. In the board room, Team Deli Fresh made even more mistakes by presenting the wrong figures to board members as well as not nominating one member who was the weakest link to take blame. Peter Ruhiu Njogu decided to quit which did not go well with the board members and had to go and subsequently leaves the show. Anne Githu, Kenneth Ng'enoh and David Kamunde Mwirigi were put on probation for lack of focus, presentation of wrong data as well as the team leader lack of leadership. This episode aired on November 3, 2011


## Episode 3

This episode aired on November 10, 2011 on Kenyan TV Stations: Kiss TV and KBC at 8 PM EAT. (It is also available on their official website for viewing.) The remaining 13 participants remaining had had a reality check having been through the first board appearance and consequent eviction in the previous episode. They were more keen and highly anticipated the next task.

Week 2 began with a motivational session in the house. This was conducted by Susan Koinange (MD Koba Waters Ltd.) She encouraged the participants to form 'master-mind groups' or 'likeness teams.' These teams were to meet often in order to keep the team members inspired. She used the metaphor of making 'apple juice with the apples given to them.'

The task briefing was delivered differently. Instead of the Board meeting the participants and informing them, it was presented to them at the house by Kirika Kirimi in a sealed envelope. They were instructed to read the contents within and discuss it within 30 minutes. In addition, they were to nominate 1 participant who was to be 'immune' from eviction that week.

The Task brief of 2 November 2011 was read to the entire team by Roy Muriuki. It read:
 *...following last week's contest, the board was displeased and was of the feeling that neither of the teams executed the tasks with the diligence it deserved. To this end, the Board has decided to not personally attend the briefing. The Board sincerely hopes that this week's task will be taken more seriously and executed in a more fitting fashion...*

On the tasks at hand:
 *...the car & the upholstery cleaning business is expanding rapidly in Kenya from high end car washes to the less tech enabled ones across the country, business is brisk, the common denominator for all these businesses however is whether they are able to get customers to their businesses or not and how mush money they make. You will be required to run a car wash business for your next task... you will take care of everything that concerns the business for the day. This task will be executed between 8 AM - 3 PM. Remember,* **profitability is what dictates the growth of any business***...*

The second task brought the contestants to DGM Car Wash in Nairobi. ***Team Ultimate*** had deliberated to charge a minimum of KSh.150/= per car and were willing to go as high as the client seemed able to afford whereas ***Team Deli Fresh*** had decided to range between KSh.200/= - KSh.250/=. They were welcomed by the proprietor 'Caroline' and briefly oriented. She then gave them an envelope containing further instructions from the Board for them.

They were instructed to form 2 new teams ensuring that not more than 4 members form the previous teams were to be together again in the new teams! This was to be completed within 30 minutes.


### The new teams

5. Sylvanus Osoro
6. Kenneth Ng'enoh
7. William Waweru

### The challenges arising among the teams

* Duty allocation / division of labour
* Equipment preparation
* Customer acquisition
* Competing for the same clients (both teams were at the same car wash, getting cars from the same highway)
* The equipment not being versatile enough (e.g. the washing pipes being too short to reach all areas of some trucks to be washed.)
* Customer complaints
* Customers bargaining for the lowest price
* Convincing potential clients to pop in for a wash
* Stealing each other's clients
* Some dissatisfied clients
* Weather change (it began to pour rather heavily)
* Coordination between the sales team & the work-force
* Pulling in more cars than they could handle at a given time
* Washing the cars in a rush hence not cleaning them satisfactorily
* Having to pay for venue (which they discovered after they were done for the day)

### Strategies

* The two teams each divided themselves into two groups; one went out to market themselves and attract clients while the other got down to cleaning the cars that came through!
* The sales teams were cut-throat - literally bringing traffic to a standstill!
* The teams using the rain - interruption of workflow to strategize further
* When told of the rental charge that they had overlooked, they bargained to cut down their losses

### Point of caution

* The Task wasn't about *washing cars* but about *running a car wash!*

### In The Board Room


#### Characteristics to remember about each Board member


##### Gerald Wamalwa

Seeks *integrity & excellence and does not tolerate short cuts*


##### Dr. Catherine Masitsa

Seeks *the daring entrepreneur who is out to seize the chance*


##### Moses Nderitu

Seeks *the perceptive entrepreneur with an eye for opportunity who's willing to risk it* 


#### What the Board members observed


##### Gerald Wamalwa

1. The Set price for washing a car at the car wash was set at KSh.150/= whereas some of the teams were charging higher than that.
2. This was a manual task and so cars were to be done one at a time
3. Financials would have to be discussed further because the bottom-line did not reflect well

##### Dr. Catherine Masitsa

1. Although profit was a key objective, it should not have been sought at the cost of customer satisfaction and quality assurance

##### Moses Nderitu

1. Some team members got into the clients' cars in order to lead them to the car wash, a violation of personal space
2. They were at liberty to utilize the 'manpower' at the car wash
3. The team leaders should have gone to negotiate with for additional labor since they were clearly overwhelmed hence finding out what the charge to be levied on them would be and then consider this

#### Boardroom Session

There were some light moments when David said the figure was imaginary and no facts was used to support this. Paul was grilled for presenting a financial projection with wrong addition figures. On the other hand, Team Synergy didn't include the sales Projections in their financial analysis.

Both teams then presented their final ad to the Soft and Lovely MD and Jerry Nyagah, Creative Director, Redsky Advertising. The board was then briefed on how the teams performed.

Boardroom session
Both teams had to brief the board on the task. Team Aspire gave wrong financial projections to the board which did not go well with the board. Team Ultimate projected that the client will spend KSh.1.6 million/= then make sales of the same amount but they forgot to put a disclaimer on how long to make a profit. They also focused on use of banners and fliers which was not practical since most people don't read. Team Aspire ultimately won the task for creating a good advertisement campaign as well as practical solutions as well as their catchphrase "Tokelezea" which was trendy.
Team Ultimate was put to task why they didn't get the market brief, Market target and the creative right. The board identified that Roy Muriuki was in charge of the creative and Sylvanus who was in charge of Market brief. The board was also infuriated by the contestants not owning up to the task they were doing. The board determined that the team lost because of poor message delivery, a task done by Roy Muriuki who was in charge of creative thus he had to go. The board also decided that Sylvanus was in charge of Market briefing as well as defining the target market which led to them losing the task.
