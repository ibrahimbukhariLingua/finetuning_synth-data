## History

Brightspeed of Texas was founded in 1956 as Central Telephone of Texas, a subsidiary of Centel. In 1992, Centel was acquired by Sprint, and Central of Texas began doing business under the Sprint name, but retained its legal name.

In 2006, the company was spun off into Embarq when Sprint Nextel spun off its local telephone operations.

The company did business as **CenturyLink** from 2009-2022, following the acquisition of Embarq by CenturyTel.
