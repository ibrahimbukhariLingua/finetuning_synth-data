**Taxation in Greece** is based on the direct and indirect systems. The total tax revenue in 2017 was €47.56 billion from which €20.62 billion came from direct taxes and €26.94 billion from indirect taxes. The total tax revenue represented 39.4% of GDP in 2017. Taxes in Greece are collected by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (Ανεξάρτητη Αρχή Δημοσίων Εσόδων).


## Income tax

Income taxation in Greece is progressive. Income tax is payable by all individuals earning income in Greece, regardless of citizenship or place of permanent residence. Permanent residents are taxed on their worldwide income in Greece. An individual in Greece is liable for tax on their income as an employee and on income as a self-employed person. In the case of an individual who is a *permanent resident* of Greece, their tax owed is calculated on their income earned in Greece and overseas. An individual whose income is only from a wage is not obligated to file an annual return. The employer deducts tax from the employee and transfers it to the tax authority every month.

The 2014 tax rates are as follows:

| Income | Taxation |
| --- | --- |
| €0 – €25,000 | 22% |
| €25,001 – €42,000 | 32% |
| > €42,001 | 42% |

On May 9, 2016, a new set of emergency measures were voted in the Parliament by the SYRIZA/ANEL government. These changes include new income tax rates as well as new solidarity tax rates. The tax rates applicable to income earned in 2016 are as follows:

| Income | Taxation |
| --- | --- |
| €0 – €20,000 | 22% |
| €20,001 – €30,000 | 29% |
| €30,001 – €40,000 | 37% |
| > €40,001 | 45% |

The solidarity tax rates are progressive ranging from 2.2% to 10%. They are assigned as follows:

| Income | Solidarity tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| €0 – €12,000 | 0% |
| €12,001 – €20,000 | 2.2% |
| €20,001 – €30,000 | 5% |
| €30,001 – €40,000 | 6.5% |
| €40,001 – €65,000 | 7.5% |
| €65,001 – €220,000 | 9% |
| > €220,001 | 10% |

But as 1 January 2020 the tax rate for the solidarity contribution will have been amended as in the table below:

| Income | Solidarity tax rate |
| --- | --- |
| €0 – €30,000 | 0% |
| €30,001 – €40,000 | 2% |
| €40,001 – €65,000 | 5% |
| €65,001 – €220,000 | 9% |
| > €220,001 | 10% |


## Social security tax


### Employees

An employer is obligated to deduct tax at source from an employee and to make additional contributions to social security as in many other EU member states. The employer's contribution amounts to 24.56% of the salary. The employee's contribution is 15.5%. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Self-employed or contractors

The basic social security contributions amount to the 27.1% of total income (after VAT paid, qualified expenses deducted and before income tax paid). This number can broken down to 20.0% for public pension funding and 7.1% for the public health system.

An extra 7.0% is charged for people enlisted to added benefits public pension schemes. An extra 4.0% is charged for people enlisted to retirement bonuses public schemes. Thus the total contributions can go as high as 38.1% of income.

Income range for calculation of Social security tax is 4,923 - 70,330 EUR per year. If annual income is out of the range above, the lower/higher limits respectively will be considered for calculation.

Especially for agriculture professionals, the basic contribution of 27.1% will be lower until 2021, as follows:

* 21.1% in 2017
* 23.1% in 2018
* 25.1% in 2019
* 26.1% in 2020
* 26.6% in 2021
* 27.1% in 2022+

Especially for doctors, pharmacists, engineers, lawyers and economists, the total contribution of 27.1-38.1% will be 5-50% lower until 31/12/2020, as follows:

* For total income 0–7,000 EUR 0% lower
* For total income 7,000-13,000 EUR 50% lower
* For total income 13,000-14,000 EUR 49% lower
* For total income 14,000-15,000 EUR 48% lower
* For total income 56,000-57,000 EUR 6% lower
* For total income 57,000-58,000 EUR 5% lower
* For total income 58,000+ 0% lower

## Corporation tax

## Other taxes


### Real property tax

The Real property tax is levied on property, that is located in Greece. The tax composes of two parts, the main tax and the additional tax.

The additional tax is derived from the total tax value of all the taxpayer's property and it ranges from 0.15% to 1.15% depending on the total value of the property. The additional tax is in effect, if the total value of the taxed property exceeds €250,000.

The former ranges from 1% to 10% of the "tax value" after the deduction of a tax-free amount, depending on the relationship of the taxpayer with the testator.
