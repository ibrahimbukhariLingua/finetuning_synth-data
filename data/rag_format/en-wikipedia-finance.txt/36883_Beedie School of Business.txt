Beedie School of Business


# Beedie School of Business



SFU's **Beedie School of Business** ("SFU Beedie") is the business school at Simon Fraser University (SFU) with multiple campuses across the Lower Mainland in British Columbia, Canada. Simon Fraser University was founded in 1965 and by 1982, the business discipline had grown to sufficient size to become its own distinct faculty, and the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree was established. In 2022, SFU Beedie celebrates its 40th anniversary.

SFU Beedie operates on all three SFU campuses, with over 3,800 undergraduate BBA students in the Vancouver suburbs of Burnaby and Surrey; over 800 MBA and graduate students in SFU Beedie's Segal Graduate School in downtown Vancouver and SFU Surrey; non-credit programs at the director, executive and management levels; and a PhD program.

In 1968, SFU Beedie established the Executive MBA (EMBA) program, the first of its kind in Canada. Since 2000, the school has launched the Management of Technology MBA, the Master of Science in Finance program, and a full-time and part-time MBA. In 2011, the school launched the world's first Executive MBA for the Americas in partnership with graduate business schools at Vanderbilt University (U.S.), Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (Mexico) and Institute of Management Foundation (Brazil). That same year, it launched Canada's first Indigenous Business Leadership Executive MBA, the first accredited MBA program in North America addressing Indigenous business, economic development and entrepreneurship. In 2011, the school received a donation in the amount of $22 million from alumnus Ryan Beedie and his father Keith, establishing SFU's Beedie School of Business. In 2014, the school introduced the Graduate Certificate in Science and Technology Commercialization, a full-time certificate program providing research scientists and engineers with the frameworks, perspectives, and techniques needed for fostering product development and commercialization. In 2016, SFU Beedie alumnus Charles Chang presented a $10 million gift to Simon Fraser University to establish SFU's Charles Chang Institute for Entrepreneurship. SFU Beedie partnered with Mitacs in 2019 to develop the Mitacs Invention to Innovation (i2I) skills training program, now a national program with regional delivery partners Queen’s, Polytechnique, Memorial and Dalhousie Universities.

SFU's Beedie School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS). SFU Beedie is ranked among the top ten business schools in Canada by Maclean's.
