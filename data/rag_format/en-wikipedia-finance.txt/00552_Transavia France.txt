# Transavia France



**Transavia Airlines S.A.S.**, trading as **Transavia France** and formerly branded as *transavia.com France*, is a French low-cost airline owned by Air France and Transavia based at Paris Orly Airport. It shares its corporate design, website and operating model with its Dutch parent company, Transavia.


## History

Transavia France was established as *transavia.com France* on 14 November 2006 by Air France and the Dutch airline Transavia (*transavia.com* back then) and began its operations in May 2007 operating scheduled and charter flights.

Transavia France chiefly operates scheduled and charter services to leisure and some metropolitan destinations and is now positioned as part of Air France-KLM's joint low-cost brand which operates under the Transavia name in both the Netherlands and France. By early 2015, Transavia France, together with its Dutch sister company, received a new corporate design, dropping the ".com" from its public appearance as well as changing its primary colors from white/green/blue to white/green. In 2013 Antoine Pussiau was the CEO since January. Natalie Stubler, as CEO of Transavia France from 2016-2022, expanded the number of destinations and the fleet.

In 2018, Transavia France decided to further expand its base at Lyon Airport and at Nantes Airport with the addition of more based aircraft and the expansion of the existing routes.

In November 2019, Transavia France stated that it would open a new base in Spring 2020 at Montpellier–Méditerranée Airport with a planned 20 routes served by the end of that year.
