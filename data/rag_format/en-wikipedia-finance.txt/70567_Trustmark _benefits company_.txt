## History

Trustmark was founded in 1913 as the Brotherhood of All Railway Employees when two railroad employees and two insurance experts teamed up to provide financial security for injured and disabled railway workers. They operated out of a one-desk office in downtown Chicago, paying 90 percent of claims the same day they reached the office. In 1917, the company adopted the name Benefit Association of Railway Employees. In 1963 the company became Benefit Trust Life Insurance Company. Only in 1994 was the name "Trustmark Insurance Company" adopted, upon merger with Bankers Mutual Life of Freeport.

In 2010 the company purchased Health Fitness Corporation of Bloomington, Minnesota to expand their offerings into consumer health programs that encourage workers to stay fit and healthy. In 2012 United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius issued a finding, under powers granted by the Affordable Care Act, that unreasonable insurance rate increases would “affect nearly 10,000 people in Alabama, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wyoming". Trustmark responded that the company was in compliance with all aspects of the Affordable Care Act and that, in cases where it did not reach the required loss ratio, it would, as required, rebate the difference to customers.
