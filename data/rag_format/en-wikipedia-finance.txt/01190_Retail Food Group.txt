## Controversy

A 2017 investigation by Sydney Morning Herald noted that hundreds of franchisees were left financially devastated after investing in the brands under the RFG umbrella.

In December 2022, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission won a civil court case against RFG resulting in Michel's Patisserie and Gloria Jean's franchises receiving repayments and debt erasures totalling $10 million as part of a settlement relating to allegedly illegitimate marketing expenses and allegedly being sold loss-making shops.
