Energy Regulators Association of East Africa


# Energy Regulators Association of East Africa



The **Energy Regulators Association of East Africa (EREA)** is a non-profit organisation mandated to spearhead harmonisation of energy regulatory frameworks, sustainable capacity building and information sharing among the List of energy regulatory bodies in the East African Community. Its key objective is to promote the independence of national regulators and support the establishment of a robust East African energy union.


## Foundation and mission

On 28 May 2008, four national energy regulatory authorities voluntarily signed a "Memorandum of Understanding" for the establishment of the Energy Regulators Association of East Africa (EREA). Subsequently, it was recognized by the 8th Sectoral Council on Energy of East African Community (EAC) as a forum of energy regulators in the EAC on 21 June 2013. It was registered by the United Republic of Tanzania on 23 May 2019 into a company limited by guarantees and without share capital under the Companies Act, 2002, and the Memorandum of Association. The EREA represents seven members – the national energy regulators from the EAC Member States.

The EREA works closely with the EAC, African Union Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP)-Independent Regulatory Board (IRB), National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and The Regional Association of Energy Regulators for Eastern and Southern Africa (RAERESA). EREA's seat is in Arusha, Tanzania.


## Objectives and functions

EREA is composed of nine Key Result Areas and the objectives are summarised as follows:

* Facilitating the harmonization of NRI’s policies, tariff structures and legislation in the Member States;
* Sustainable Capacity Building through the establishment of the Energy Regulation Centre of Excellence (ERCE) to support regional member institutions
* contribute to the advancement of research on regulatory issues
* Promoting regional co-operation in the planning and development of an integrated energy market and infrastructure.
* Promoting independent regulation in the East African Community.

EREA was established to also, amongst other objectives; strengthen economic, commercial, social, cultural, political, technological and other ties for fast balanced and sustainable development within the East African region.

Others include Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) of Uganda, Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) of Rwanda and Autorité de Régulation des secteurs de l’Eau potable et de l’Energie (AREEN) of Burundi.
