The Medici Effect


# The Medici Effect



***The Medici Effect: Breakthrough Insights at the Intersection of Ideas, Concepts, and Cultures*** is a 2004 book written by American entrepreneur Frans Johansson. Published by Harvard Business School Press, it was listed as a *Top 10 Business Book* by Amazon.com and translated into 18 different languages. In the book, Johansson introduced the concept of the Medici Effect, which involves innovation that happens when disciplines and ideas intersect.


## Summary

In the book, Johansson argues that innovation comes from diverse industries, cultures, and disciplines when they all intersect, bringing ideas from one field into another. He also recommends assembling diverse teams of people to collaborate on innovation.

The name of the book is derived from the Medici Dynasty, an Italian banking family that came to power in the 14th century. The family's wealth was able to support artists that led to The Renaissance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The book looks at examples of how Renaissance painters, sculptors, poets, philanthropists, scientists, philosophers, financiers, and architects, shaped historical eras of innovation. The Medici family did not intend the Renaissance, but contributed to it with what Johansson coins as the "Medici Effect."

The book became the foundation for the Medici Effect, which involves contributions of disruptive innovation from people who have no experience in an industry. An example from the book includes Charles Darwin being a geologist and collecting a number of bird species from the Galápagos Islands. Darwin kept poor notes of his collection and returned the birds and notes over to John Gould upon his return. Gould was an expert ornithologist and initially dismissed the birds as being normal. Gould later discovered that each species was in fact distinct. The example from the book shows how Darwin, without the knowledge of ornithology, could contribute to the field without having the training or knowledge.


## Reception

*BusinessWeek* called *The Medici Effect* "one of the best books on innovation."

The book became a best-seller and was listed as a *Top 10 Business Book* by Amazon.com. It was also translated into 18 different languages.
