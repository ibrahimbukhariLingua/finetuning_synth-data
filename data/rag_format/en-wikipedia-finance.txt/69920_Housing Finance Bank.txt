Housing Finance Bank


# Housing Finance Bank



**Housing Finance Bank** (**HFB**) is a commercial bank in Uganda. It is one of the commercial banks licensed by Bank of Uganda, the national banking regulator.


## Overview

HFB is a full service retail bank that is primarily involved in mortgage banking. Founded in 1967 as a housing finance company, HFB became a fully licensed commercial bank in January 2008, having acquired a commercial banking license from the Bank of Uganda. The bank is the leading mortgage lender in the country, with approximately 60 percent of all Ugandan mortgage accounts. On 31 December 2023, the bank's assets were USh2.14 trillion (US$569.641 million). The bank made an after-tax profit of USh65.1 billion (US$16.37 million) in 2023. At that time, core capital was USh273.8 billion (approx. US$72.9 million). As of December 2023, as reported by the *Nile Post Uganda*, HFB's loan book was valued at Shs414.192 billion (approx. US$113.454 million, at that time).

In August 2017, the two largest shareholders in the bank, the Uganda government and NSSF Uganda, each contributed $8.2 million (for a total of $16.4 million) in fresh capital, to boost the bank's ability to lend to more mortgage borrowers and improve the lender's liquidity.


## Ownership

HFB is owned by the Uganda National Social Security Fund (50.0 percent). The government of Uganda, through the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, owns 49.18 percent. The remaining 0.82 percent is owned by the National Housing and Construction Company, a parastatal company jointly owned by the government of Uganda (51 percent) and the government of Libya (49 percent).

HFB had planned to list its shares on the Uganda Securities Exchange in 2012, however, those plans were postponed.
