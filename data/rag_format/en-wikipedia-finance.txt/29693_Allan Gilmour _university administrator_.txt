## Early life and education

Allan Dana Gilmour was born on June 17, 1934 in Barnet, Vermont, and was raised on Maplemont Farm in Barnet. He is the oldest son of Marjorie Fyler Gilmour (1906-1987), a homemaker, and Albert Davis Gilmour (1900-1980), a dairy cow dealer.

After Exeter, Gilmour attended Harvard University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1956.

Gilmour finished his MBA requirements in three semesters, and graduated in 1959. He also worked as a teaching fellow and studied for a PhD at Michigan.


## Career


### Ford Motor Company

In 1960, Gilmour was hired as a financial analyst at Ford Motor Company. Throughout his initial thirty-five year career at Ford, he served as vice president of external and personnel affairs, vice president and controller, chief financial officer and a member of the board of directors (1986), executive vice president for international automotive operations (1987), president of Ford Automotive Group (1990), president of Ford Motor Credit Company, and vice chairman (1993), the number two position in command.

Gilmour was the leading candidate to become Ford's chairman and chief executive officer on two separate occasions. In 1989, he was thought to be the choice of outgoing CEO Donald Petersen, yet was passed over for Red Poling. In 1992, Gilmour was passed over again, this time for Alex Trotman. After being rejected twice for CEO, Gilmour, who was not openly gay, decided to retire from Ford in 1995 at age 60.

In December 1996, Gilmour came out as gay in an interview with a Detroit LGBTQ publication. He is recognized as the first corporate executive to be identified as gay and to serve as chairman or vice chairman of a Fortune 100 company. In 2002, Gilmour, returned to Ford as chief financial officer, and retired three years later in 2005. In total, Gilmour worked at Ford for thirty-eight years.

Gilmour was the principal owner of a Ford-Chrysler dealership located in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.

Upon his retirement, Gilmour donated his salary that he earned during his tenure back to the university in the form of an endowed scholarship gift to honor his husband, Eric Jirgens.


## Personal life

In the spring of 1994, Gilmour met Eric Jirgens, who is twenty-eight years younger than him, at a dinner party in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. In 1995, Gilmour and Jirgens co-founded the Gilmour-Jirgens Fund that has donated millions of dollars to charity, including lesbian and gay organizations. The fund is managed by the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan. In 2015, Gilmour and Jirgens married, and the couple live in Birmingham, Michigan.
