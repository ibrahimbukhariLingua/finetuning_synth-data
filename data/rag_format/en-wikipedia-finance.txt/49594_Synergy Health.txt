The company provides specialist outsourced services to the healthcare and related markets around the world, including sterilization services for medical device and other manufacturers, decontamination of surgical instruments for hospitals and other medical practitioners together with related hygiene services.

## History

Synergy was founded in 1991 as a manufacturer of surgical packs in Corby, Northamptonshire, listing on the Alternative Investment Market in London that same year. In subsequent years the company grew organically and through acquisition, buying a number of healthcare-related companies including Shiloh, and Vernon Carus in the United Kingdom; Isotron Plc which extended the company's footprint in Europe and Asia, and MSI and SRI which acted as a springboard into the United States.

In October 2014, medical technology provider Steris Corporation agreed to buy Synergy for £1.2 billion ($1.9 billion). The new Steris Corporation will be based in the UK for tax purposes (35 percent in US and only 25 percent in UK), while the US business will still operate.
