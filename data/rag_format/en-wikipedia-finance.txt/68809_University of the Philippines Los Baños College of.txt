# University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Economics and Management



The **College of Economics and Management (CEM)** is one of the eleven degree-granting units of the University of the Philippines Los Baños. It is the first in Asia to offer degree programs in Agricultural Economics and has trained agricultural, resource and environmental economists from all over the continent.

CEM is composed of four departments - the Department of Agricultural Economics, Department of Economics, Department of Agribusiness Management and Entrepreneurship, and the Institute of Cooperatives and Bio-Enterprise Development (ICOPED). Also affiliated with the college is the Agribusiness Center for Entrepreneurs and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Center for Technology Exchange and Training for Small and Medium Enterprises (ACTETSME).


## History

The College traces its roots from the Institute of Agricultural Development and Administration under the College of Agriculture in 1975 with three Departments - Agricultural Economics, Economics, and Management. It later became the College of Development Economics and Management which merged IADA with the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Studies and the Agrarian Reform Institute in 1978.


## UPLB Agribusiness Management and Entrepreneurship (DAME)

The first undergraduate program in Agribusiness was established at the UP College of Agriculture in Los Baños, Philippines as Bachelor of Science in Agriculture major in Agribusiness in 1966. The program was initially a joint undertaking with the UP College of Business Administration in Diliman, Quezon City until 1975. In 1969, a seminar titled "*Advanced Agribusiness Management*" was held in Manila which led to Jose D. Drilon publishing the book "*Agribusiness Management Resource Materials*," the foundation of current agribusiness programs around the world.

Drilon further expanded the concept of agribusiness to include coordinators for agribusiness structure and policy such as governments and research institutions in his 1971 book. Goldberg meanwhile added other coordinators such as schools, financial institutions, and cooperatives. D.K. Desai (1973) attempted to integrate all the entities and sectors within agribusiness and called it the **Agribusiness System**.

In 1975, the newly created Institute of Agricultural Development and Administration (now CEM) assumed sole administration of the program. The program was officially recognized as B.S. in Agricultural Business in 1978. In June 1983, the program was renamed B.S. in Agribusiness Management then in 2017 B.S. in Agribusiness Management and Entrepreneurship.
