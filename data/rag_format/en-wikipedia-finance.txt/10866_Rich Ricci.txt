In 2008, he was part of the team that took over Lehmann Brothers' Investment arm for Barclays and oversaw their integration with Barclays. In 2011, he received a bonus of £44 million, with newspapers attributing his name to nominative determinism. Due to the Libor scandal, Ricci did not receive a bonus for 2012, however he did earn £17 million after selling Barclays shares after they were released to senior executives. Ricci resigned from Barclays in 2013. After leaving Barclays, he became head of the Liberum Investment Bank.


## Horse racing

Despite being based in England for much of his career, Ricci and his wife Susannah have been involved in horse racing in Ireland since 2005, owning a large number of racehorses trained by champion trainer Willie Mullins. He later started entering them in British and Australian races.

At the 2016 Cheltenham Festival, 3 of his horses won earning him £248,000.
