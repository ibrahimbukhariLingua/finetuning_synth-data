## Career

Charlwood serves as the executive chairman of Charlwood Pacific Group, which owns Century 21 Canada, Century 21 Asia-Pacific, Uniglobe Travel International, Centum Financial Group and Real Property Management Canada. These companies have more than 1,700 franchise locations with more than 26,000 support staff in 561 cities in 67 countries, making it one of the largest international franchise systems in Canada, reportedly by REM (magazine).

He established UNIGLOBE Travel International in 1979, which is one of the largest travel agencies in number of outlets in the world.

In 1975 U. Gary along with Peter H. Thomas bought the franchise rights for Century 21 Real Estate Canada. But unfortunately, the Century 21 concept was shut down by the Real Estate Council of BC, as it was claimed that franchising was illegal in the real estate brokerage business. Charlwood challenged the ruling in court and won, following which he successfully opened the door to a wide array of American brokerages now commonplace in Canada, including RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker and, more recently, Royal LePage. CENTURY 21 Canada was the first real estate brokerage company with offices coast to coast in Canada. Currently, Century 21 remains one of the largest companies in Canada with more than 400 locations and 10,000 system members. The Charlwood Pacific Group also holds 50% ownership in Century 21 Asia Pacific. His Canadian and Asian Century 21 companies have a combined 939 franchisees, employing 19000 salespeople as of June 2016.

In 2002, he founded Centum, a mortgage brokerage franchise brand. His Canadian and Asian Century 21 companies have a combined 939 franchisees, employing 19,000 salespeople, as of June 2016.,

In 2010, he acquired the Real Property Management (RPM) rights for Canada, a Utah based company which manages properties for real estate investors.

Before starting his own company, Charlwood also worked for Western Airlines (now Delta Air Lines) and CP Air (now Air Canada).

He was elected as Chairman of the International Franchise Association of Washington, DC, the only non-American to ever hold the position.
