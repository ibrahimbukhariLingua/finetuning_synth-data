## History


### China Ocean Shipping Company (1961–1993)

China Ocean Shipping Company, or COSCO in short, was founded in 1961 as a Chinese government agency. In the same year, a subsidiary was formed in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. The Guangzhou subsidiary purchased a British vessel and renamed it as *Guanghua* (Chinese: 光华). *Guanghua* made its maiden voyage to Jakarta for the People's Republic of China in April 1961.

After the US resumed diplomatic relations with China in the 1970s, China Ocean Shipping Company signed an agreement with American company Lykes Brothers Steamship Company in 1979. The agreement opens the commercial sea routes between the United States and the People's Republic of China. In the same year, COSCO became the Chinese side representative to collaborate with International Telephone and Telegraph on repairing the communication facilities in the coastal cities of China.

In 1981, COSCO won a contract from the Pakistani Government owned National Tanker Company of Pakistan, for crude oil transport.

In 1991 COSCO was asked by the US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) to submit information regarding Chinese Government restricting U.S.-flag carriers on doing business in China. COSCO asked FMC to drop its probe instead. FMC also investigated COSCO for its pricing behavior in 1997, but stated there was not enough evidence to launch a formal probe on alleged under-pricing its service to eliminate competitor.

In August 1993, COSCO's ship *Yinhe*, was anchored off the coast of Oman. US government alleged that the ship carried material exported to Iran, which could be used to make chemical weapons. COSCO claimed that the ship only contained "paper goods, hardware and machine parts". In what became known as the Yinhe incident, United States military vessels and aircraft followed the *Yinhe,* disrupting its normal travel route.⁶⁹ The United States unilaterally disabled the *Yinhe*'s civilian GPS, causing it lose direction and anchor on the high seas for twenty-four days until it agreed to inspection. The *Yinhe* experienced shortages of water and fuel.⁶⁹–⁷⁰ The inspection, which occurred in Saudi Arabia did not find any improper chemicals and on September 4, representatives of the Chinese, Saudi and United States governments jointly signed a certification that the ship's cargo did not contain materials related to chemical weapons.⁵⁴
