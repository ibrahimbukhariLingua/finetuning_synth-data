## History

Power Financial Corporation has interests in companies in the financial services sector in Canada, the United States and Europe. While its parent company Power Corporation was originally established as an electric utility holding company, the company became a conglomerate with major interests in the finance industry.

Founded in 1984 with the ambition of creating an integrated financial services group, Power Financial has remained committed to the growth and evolution of its primary holdings through its controlling interests in Great West Lifeco and IGM. Power Financial also has significant holdings in a portfolio of global companies based in Europe through its investment in Pargesa.

The Nesbitt family sold most of their interest in Power Corporation to the Paul Desmarais group in 1968.

R. Jeffrey Orr was named Power Financial Corporation CEO in 2005.

By 2007, IGM Financial was the holding company for Power Corporation's investment fund companies. Power Corporation also by 2009 had interests in the parent company of *La Presse*, Mackenzie Financial, London Life Insurance, Canada Life Assurance, Great-West Life, and Putnam Investments.


### 2020 reorganization

On December 13, 2019, Power Corporation announced a reorganization transaction through which each common share of Power Financial would be exchanged for 1.05 subordinate voting shares of Power Corporation and $0.01 in cash.
