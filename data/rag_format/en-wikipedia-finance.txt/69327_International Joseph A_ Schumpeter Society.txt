International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society


# International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society



The **International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society** (ISS) is an economics association aimed at furthering research in the spirit of Joseph Schumpeter. Wolfgang F. Stolper and Horst Hanusch initiated the foundation of the society in 1986.

The primary objective of the International Joseph Alois Schumpeter Society is the advancement of knowledge in the broad research area of the dynamics of structural change, its origins, and its effects. These topics include studies addressing the role of the dynamic entrepreneur, the political and social problems of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial history as well as research question concerning income distribution, technical change, and employment. The society welcomes scientifically sound and non-ideological research by scholars of all scholarly traditions. Following Joseph Schumpeter, research should respect "facts as they are and behave and not as one wishes them to be or behave."

The ISS organizes a biannual conference on topics that mirror Schumpeterian ideas, helps financing international conferences, and promotes the dissemination of research through conference proceedings and other publications. Recent scholarly contributions related to Schumpeter are awarded with academic prizes by the ISS. In 1993 the Society adopted the Journal of Evolutionary Economics, founded in 1991, as its house journal.
