# Flyr (airline)



**Flyr AS** (OSE: FLYR) was a short-lived Norwegian low-cost airline. Headquartered in Oslo with an operational base at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, the airline operated flights within Norway and between Norway and European leisure destinations. Flyr ceased operations on 31 January 2023.


## History


### Foundation

Flyr was founded by Erik G. Braathen in 2020, the former CEO of the now-defunct Norwegian carrier Braathens. The name *Flyr* is Norwegian for *flying*. In June 2021, Flyr was issued an air operator's certificate by the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway. The airline originally planned to operate up to 30 aircraft to domestic and European destinations, while selling tickets to passengers solely via their own mobile app. The first flight from Oslo to Tromsø was operated by a Boeing 737-800.


### Financial difficulties

In October 2022, Flyr announced they would cut their winter schedule by half to save nearly 40 Million Euros due to significantly decreased demand. As of November 2022, the airline was in the process to acquire additional funds from investors stating that it otherwise cannot guarantee to maintain its future operations, it however failed to reach the requested sum during the first try. Flyr also stated it would lease at least one of their aircraft to another airline.

On 30 January 2023, Flyr announced that their alternative financial plan failed. The board of directors were looking for a new alternative way to finance the airline. However, on 1 February 2023 the airline went into administration and ceased all flights.
