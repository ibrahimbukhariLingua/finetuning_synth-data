German Taxpayers Federation


# German Taxpayers Federation



The **German Taxpayers Federation** (German: ***Bund der Steuerzahler e. V.** (**BdSt**)*) is a right-wing association. The BdSt is one of the most traditional lobbying organizations in German federal politics.


## History

BdSt was established in 1949 by Karl Bräuer. It is known for striking actions such as the “National Debt Clock” installed in Berlin’s government district and the “Taxpayers Memorial Day”.


## Purpose

BdSt aims to low taxation and public spending for public service, as well as the reduction of bureaucracy and public debt. Political demands include minimal government and low tax rates for corporations, shareholders and wealthy tax payers.


## Representation

The BdSt presents itself as a representative of the citizens, but is in fact not a representative image of the tax-paying population in Germany: Around 60% of its members are entrepreneurs and companies, another 15% are freelancers.

The BdSt sued against the federal solidarity surcharge (*Solidaritätszuschlag*). In 2021, only top earners (corporations and shareholders) will pay this. The full rate of 5.5 percent applies to corporate profits of corporations, to share profits and to income from around €110,000 gross. 90 percent of income tax payers in Germany no longer pay the Solidaritätszuschlag at all.


## Cooperation

For many years, the BdSt has cooperated closely with Hamburg-Mannheimer insurance company (Ergo group) in the area of member recruitment. At Hamburg-Mannheimer there are representatives who are exclusively responsible for recruiting members for BdSt and at the same time use this to recruit new customers for the insurance company.


## Personnel

The chairman of the BdSt Reiner Holznagel was a public relations officer for the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania CDU before his involvement with the organization.

AfD politician Kristin Brinker was head of BdSt Berlin from 2012 to 2016 and then founding the Berlin state organization of far-right Alternative for Germany. Rainer Brüderle, FDP politician and former federal minister is president of BdSt Rhineland-Palatinate. Rolf Baron Vielhauer von Hohenhau, CSU politician and manager is president of BdSt Bavaria since 1983.


## Not non-profit

A legal report concluded in 2023 that the organization itself is not a non-profit organization. BdSt is being incorrect treated this way by the German tax office. The report was commissioned by Campact, which wanted to initiate a new debate about non-profit law.


## Reception

The journalist Friedrich Küppersbusch argued in 2021: “The Taxpayers' Association is a lobby made up of the Union and the FDP that wants to implement tax cuts for its members, the majority of whom are very wealthy. He works with fake news, with number tricks, with surreptitious advertising and with contempt for the “stupid, stupid state”.
