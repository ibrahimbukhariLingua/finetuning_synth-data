### Online Financial News

Ciarrocca came up with the idea for Wall Street Italia in New York during the summer of 1999 and the website was launched on 11 October, during the golden season of the "new economy". The offices were on the 73rd floor of the Empire State Building in Manhattan. For a few years about 30% of Wall Street Italia shares were owned by HdpNet, the Internet holding company that belonged to the leading Italian publishing group RCS-Corriere della Sera. Following the withdrawal of Corriere della Sera from the business, as chief executive officer and Editor in Chief, Ciarrocca practiced an unbiased and aggressive approach in the world of online business news. Traffic on the website grew during the years 2008–2011, along with financial crisis. Later more space was given to geopolitics and macro economy. On the morning of 11 September 2001, Luca Ciarrocca was the first in the world to give news of the Al Qaeda terrorist attack on the World Trade Center Towers. Ciarrocca sold Wall Street Italia in October 2014 to an Internet media company listed at the Milan Stock Exchange, choosing to remain independent and pursuing a career as macroeconomic author.
