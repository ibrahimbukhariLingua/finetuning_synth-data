Directive 2001/77/EC


# Directive 2001/77/EC



**Directive 2001/77/EC** is a European Union Directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation. It is popularly known as the RES Directive.

The directive, which took effect in October 2001, sets national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states. As the name implies, the EU does not strictly enforce these targets. However, The European Commission monitors the progress of the member states of the European Union â€“ and will, if necessary, propose mandatory targets for those who miss their goals.

These objectives contribute toward achieving the overall indicative EU targets, which are listed in the white paper on renewable sources of energy. Regulators want a 12% share of gross renewable domestic energy consumption by 2010 and a 20% share by 2020.

The directive was superseded by Directive 2009/28/EC, published on 23 April 2009.
