## History

Reading Anthracite Company; origins date back to 1871 when its predecessor, the **Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company** (P. & R. C.& I.) was chartered. As a large publicly traded concern, P. & R. C. & I. had diverse industrial interests which revolved primarily around its main business of railroading. P. & R. C. & I. changed its corporate title in 1956 to The Philadelphia & Reading Corporation, of which Reading Anthracite Company was one of its many operating divisions. In 1961, Philadelphia & Reading Corporation divested itself of its anthracite coal interests, selling the Reading Anthracite company to its present owners.

The unionized mine suffered an on-the-job fatality in July 2017.
