Speciesthaler


# Speciesthaler



The ***Speciesthaler***, also ***Speciestaler*** or ***Speziestaler***, was a type of silver specie coin that was widespread from the 17th to the 19th century and was based on the 9-Thaler standard of the original *Reichsthaler*. In Scandinavian sources the term *Speciesdaler* is used and, in German sources, the abbreviation *Species* was also common.


## General

The 1566 Imperial Minting Ordinance of the Holy Roman Empire stipulated that 9 *Reichsthalers* were to be coined a fine Cologne Mark of silver (ca. 234 g). The official *Reichstaler* to the *9-Thaler* standard thus had a calculated fine silver content of 25.984 g.

*Speciestaler* was a common name in (Northern) Germany and Scandinavia in the 18th and 19th centuries. The suffix *-taler* goes back to the *Joachimstaler* *Guldengroschen*. The prefix *Species-* goes back to the Latin word *species*, "face" or, in Middle Latin, "bust image". *Speciesthalers* are mostly silver coins with an embossed head or bust image of the mint owner. There are examples here from the Dresden Mint and Leipzig Mint The *Speciesthalers* from Hamburg featured the city coat of arms instead of a bust.


## Regional characteristics


### Holy Roman Empire


#### Lübeck and Hamburg

In 1619, the *Reichstaler* to a *9-Thaler* standard was designated as a value-stable accounting unit of the Hamburger Bank and referred to as the *Bankothaler* or *Banco-Thaler*. From 1622, the *Reichstaler* was the common basis of the *Mark* and *Schilling* currencies in Hamburg and Lübeck. From then, the *Reichsthaler* was divided into exactly three *Marks*.

Between 1730 and 1764 around 110,000 such *Speciesthalers* were minted in Hamburg (fineness 888 ⁸/₉; gross weight 29.2 g). The mintings from 1730 and 1735 bear the inscription *Moneta Nova*, a reference to the Imperial Minting Ordinance. On the *Speciesthalers* minted from 1761-1764 it is ao noted that there are 48 *Schilling Species*. The naming of *Schilling Species* was necessary because the silver content of the Hamburg *Schillings* which were part of the *Schilling Hamburger Current* (*Hamburger Kurantgeld*) introduced in 1725 was only 5/6 of the *Schilling Species.*
