## Achievements

As Finance Secretary to Government of India, Subbarao questioned the rationale of giving away valuable spectrum to telecom operators in 2007 at prices fixed in 2001. He argued that there must be fresh bidding to discover the current price. Subbarao gave evidence in the CBI case relating to alleged corruption by ministers and civil servants in the allocation of 2G spectrum and the judge noted in the judgement that he was a stellar witness.

Subbarao's term as Governor of RBI was by all accounts an unusually turbulent period for the world and for India. The global financial crisis erupted within a week of his assuming office. Then just as the impact of the crisis on India started ebbing, the action shifted to combating an unusually stubborn bout of inflation (2009–11) which segued into a battle against a sharp depreciation of rupee because of what came to be known as taper tantrums. Subbarao is generally credited as having safely stewarded Indian economy through the financial crisis although he has been criticized for not aggressively stemming the fall of the rupee during the taper tantrums.

Subbarao's tenure as Governor of RBI will be most remembered for the way he boldly stood up for the autonomy of the central bank. His term will also be noted for his initiatives to demystify the central bank, for opening up communication channels with stakeholders and for outreach to the larger public. He was instrumental in ensuring 100% meaningful financial inclusion in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Subbarao is credited with the theory of the New Trilemma of central bankers, which he called the "Holy Trinity" of *price stability*, *financial stability* and *sovereign debt sustainability* as against Mundell's well known "impossible trinity" of a *fixed exchange rate*, *free capital flows* and *independent monetary policy*. Subbarao's erudite exposition of the *holy trinity* firmly established the Indian perspective in the scholastic debate on the global central banking trilemma.
