### Books

In 2007, his story became the focus of the book Rigged, the True Story of an Ivy League Kid who Changed the World of Oil by Ben Mezrich. The book was published in 2008 in United Kingdom with a slight variation in the title as Rigged, The True Story of a Wall Street Novice who Changed the World of Oil Forever.

According to the author's note, D'Agostino was initially reluctant for the book to be written and author Ben Mezrich convinced D'Agostino by using a pseudonym, changing the name of the primary character to David Russo. The book appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list for one week in 2007 and another in 2008. Summit Entertainment acquired the screen rights to *Rigged*.

D'Agostino was mentioned in a book by Wall Street journalist Leah McGrath Goodman, titled *The Asylum: Inside the Rise and Ruin of the Global Oil Market* published in 2011.
