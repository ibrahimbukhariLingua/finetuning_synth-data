# Joachim Faber



**Joachim Faber** (born 10 May 1950 in Gießen) is a German lawyer and business executive.


## Education

Educated at the University of Bonn, Faber earned his doctorate at the German University of Administrative Sciences in 1982.


## Career

Faber worked for 14 years in various positions for Citicorp in Frankfurt and London. He then joined Allianz in 1997, serving as the founding CEO of Allianz Global Investors for 12 years from 2000, during which period he built it into one of the world’s biggest asset managers, with around 1.5 trillion euros ($2 trillion) under management, by the time he retired in December 2011. During his time at the helm, he guided the unit through a number of major acquisitions, including PIMCO, which managed the world’s biggest bond fund at the time.

Faber has been serving as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of German Stock Exchange Group since May 2012, succeeding Manfred Gentz. By 2017, he was criticized by investors for the failed 2016 merger with the London Stock Exchange and a compensation program awarded to Carsten Kengeter who resigned as chief executive in October 2017. Under his leadership, the supervisory board introduced a cap on the annual pay packages of its board members at 9.5 million euros ($11.3 million) each. In 2019, he announced his intention to resign by 2020.

In Munich, Faber shares an office with Ann-Kristin Achleitner, Paul Achleitner, Michael Diekmann and Peter Löscher at Palais Preysing.
