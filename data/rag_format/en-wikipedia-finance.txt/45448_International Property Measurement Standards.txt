International Property Measurement Standards


# International Property Measurement Standards



**International Property Measurement Standard** (**IPMS**) is a standardised and globally applicable method for measuring property. It aims to address current inconsistencies in the way property of all types is measured from one market to the next, improving property market data and providing greater transparency.


## Background

IPMS standard is the collaborative effort of professional and nonprofit organisations from around the world. These organisations convened for the first time at a meeting hosted by the World Bank in Washington on 01-2 May 2013, each putting forward a representative to join the IPMS Board of Trustees.

Collectively, these organisations (otherwise referred to as the **International Property Measurement Standards Coalition**, or IPMSC) have agreed to create and implement a single, shared standard for measuring property. The first phase of the project was to develop an international standard for measuring offices "IPMS for Offices" which was to be published in June 2014.

A Standards Setting Committee of 19 independent experts has been tasked with drafting the standard on behalf of the Coalition.


## Membership

On 1 May 2014, the IPMS Coalition comprised the following 39 organisations:
