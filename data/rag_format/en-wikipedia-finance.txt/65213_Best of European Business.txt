Best of European Business


# Best of European Business



**Best of European Business** (BEB) is an annual competition by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants and has been established in 2005.


## Idea

The idea of *Best of European Business* is to award European op-companies and –managers for outstanding economical performances. European entrepreneurs as role models are awarded in the categories growth, creation of value, innovation and strategy. Every year the *BEB* focusses on a certain topic. In 2011 German companies have been awarded with focus on the markets of ASEAN-countries. This ceremony does not only award the European companies and managers, but also call attention on the strengths of the European economy.
