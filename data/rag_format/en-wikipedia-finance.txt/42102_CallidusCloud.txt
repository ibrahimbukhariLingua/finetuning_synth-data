## History


### Origins

Callidus Software Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on September 6, 1996 by founders Andrew Swett and Scott Kitayama to provide Enterprise Incentive Management (EIM) application systems. Initial funding came from Onset Ventures. The first hire was former Chief Architect Greg Holmberg, followed by former President and CEO Reed D. Taussig.

In November 2003, the company had its Initial public offering on the Nasdaq National Market under the stock symbol CALD, raising US$70Â million.

Following consecutive missed street expectations and management departures, Robert Youngjohns was appointed CEO in April 2005.

Youngjohns quickly stabilized the business and developed the Sales Performance Management (SPM) proposition which elevated the company's relevance to enterprise customers. He recruited Leslie James Stretch and other key executives.

Leslie James Stretch was appointed CEO at the end of 2007. Stretch led the company for 11 years through the transition to Saas and subsequent sale to SAP in 2018.
After acquiring Litmos in June 2011, Callidus Cloud adopted the name Litmos. After being acquired by SAP in 2019, the product's name changed again to SAP Litmos.

On January 30, 2018, it was announced that the company SAP had acquired CallidusCloud for $2.4 billion.
