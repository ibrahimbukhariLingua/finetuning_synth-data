### Bay FC

On April 4, 2023, the American National Women's Soccer League awarded one of its two planned 2024 expansion teams to a Bay Area group at a reported $53 million expansion fee. The expansion announcement confirmed the involvement of Sixth Street Partners as the Bay Area group's lead investor. Sixth Street CEO Alan Waxman and former United States women's national soccer team and professional club players Brandi Chastain, Leslie Osborne, Danielle Slaton, and Aly Wagner were announced as the club's founding board members. The club would be the first professional sports team in the United States to have an institutional investor as a majority owner, in contrast to rules established by other United States sports leagues that restricted or prohibited such ownership. NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman noted that the investment did not have a target hold period, and was funded from Sixth Street Tao Partners, a balance sheet fund with no requirement to be liquidated, which the league intended to treat like an individual owner with a large net worth. The team's name, Bay FC, and logo were announced on June 1, 2023.

## History

Sixth Street was established in 2009 by a group of former Goldman Sachs colleagues led by Sixth Street CEO Alan Waxman. Sixth Street was formed to recreate the type of proprietary investing platform the group managed at Goldman.

Sixth Street was formed as a strategic partnership with TPG, which initially made $2 billion of their fund commitments available for investment by the Sixth Street team. While TPG had a minority stake in Sixth Street, the firms operated autonomously. TPG retained a passive minority ownership stake in Sixth Street, and the two firms became formally independent in May 2020.
