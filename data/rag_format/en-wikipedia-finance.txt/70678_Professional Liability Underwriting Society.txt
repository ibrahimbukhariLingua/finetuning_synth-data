# Professional Liability Underwriting Society



The **Professional Liability Underwriting Society** (PLUS) is a non-profit organization with membership open to persons interested in the promotion and development of the professional liability industry.


## History

PLUS was founded in 1990. Since then, PLUS has grown from 300 members to over 7,000 members, representing over 1,000 companies active in the many fields of professional liability, including underwriters, brokers, risk managers, program managers, attorneys, claims examiners, general agents, teachers/professors, and students.


## Education

PLUS is recognized in the industry as the primary source of professional liability educational programs and seminars. The Society's comprehensive educational approach includes an annual International Conference, annual symposia, the RPLU designation program, and educational events organized by regional chapters of PLUS, all of which provide educational and networking opportunities.

The Registered Professional Liability Underwriter (RPLU) Program provides participants with a broad, basic understanding of professional liability disciplines. The RPLU designation is the only industry designation for professionals in the field of professional liability. PLUS has developed a comprehensive curriculum for the professional liability industry. The curriculum includes 23 modules, including core modules:

* Fundamentals of Liability Insurance/Commercial General Liability Insurance: Overview
* Professional Liability Insurance: Overview
* Financial Analysis
* Professional Liability Reinsurance
* Professional Liability Insurance Claims
* Medical Professional Liability Insurance: Introduction
* Directors & Officers Liability Insurance: Introduction

**PLUS University** is a two-day, classroom-style instructional event designed for new entrants to the professional liability industry. The curriculum for PLUS University is drawn from the RPLU modules, and courses are led by experienced members of the industry.


## Events and programming

PLUS holds an annual International Conference, which brings together thousands of members from throughout the United States and around the world for three days of world-class educational programming and networking opportunities. From the inaugural meeting in 1988, which had 125 attendees, the annual International Conference has grown dramatically in both the number of attendees and in the breadth of topics covered.

The International Conference has been attended in recent years by around 2,000 participants annually and has featured speakers and panel presentations on current industry topics including legal malpractice, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the financial crisis, crisis management, shareholder litigation, and employment discrimination. Keynote speakers included former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and co-founder of Apple Computer, Inc., Steve Wozniak. Past conferences have featured noted speakers from within and outside the professional liability industry, including former United States President, Bill Clinton, and former United States Secretary of State, General Colin Powell, Prime Minister Tony Blair and best-selling author Daniel Pink. The 26th annual Conference is scheduled for November 4â€“6, 2013 in Orlando, Florida and will feature speakers including Dr. Madeleine Albright, Jeb Bush, William Cohen, Karen Hughes, and others.

PLUS also organizes panel discussions and educational, networking and charitable events throughout the year. Key events include a D&O Symposium held annually in New York which focuses on directors and officers liability issues, a Professional Risk Symposium, which focuses on employment practices, errors and omissions, and fiduciary liability, and a Medical Professional Liability Symposium. In 2013, PLUS also put on three regional professional liability symposia in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Zurich, Switzerland. Regional chapters also organize regular educational, networking and charitable events.
