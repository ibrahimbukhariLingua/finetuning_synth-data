**Narec**, since 2014 known as the **National Renewable Energy Centre**, is a part of the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, a British technology innovation and research centre for offshore wind power, wave energy, tidal energy and low carbon technologies. ORE Catapult's head office is in Glasgow, Scotland. The centre operates multi-purpose offshore renewable energy test and demonstration facilities. It is similar to other centres, such as NREL in the US and National Centre for Renewable Energies [es] (CENER) in Spain. The National Renewable Energy Centre is based in Blyth, Northumberland.


## History

Originally known as NaREC (New and Renewable Energy Centre), the centre was created in 2002 by One NorthEast, the North East regional development agency, as part of the Strategy for Success programme. In 2010 the organisation changed its name to Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre). In April 2014, the organisation merged with the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult to focus on the development and cost reduction of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy across the UK.

The organisation was originally involved in a wide range of technologies, including:

* Wind (onshore and offshore)
* Transmission and distribution
* Photovoltaics
* Oil and gas
* Marine renewables
* Fuel cells
* Microrenewables
* Biomass

In 2010, due to UK government cutbacks, Narec closed, sold off or separated parts of the business. Spin-off companies include:

**Decerna** – Working on energy efficiency, solar farm design, preparation of MW-scale battery sites, grid connection, and life-cycle assessment. The company was renamed from Narec Distributed Energy Limited in 2022.

**Solar** **Capture Technologies** – Specialises on bespoke and novel solar photovoltaic systems, including off-grid systems. Renamed from Narec Solar in 2013.

**NCL Technology Ventures** – A specialist healthcare investor, originally created by Narec and Ashberg Limited. Renamed from Narec Capital in 2013.

**Renewable Risk Advisers Limited** – renamed from Narec Capital Risk Solutions Limited in 2012.

Following its merger with ORE Catapult, the National Renewable Energy Centre now focuses on helping to de-risk and accelerate the development and commercialisation of the offshore renewable energy industry in the UK.


## Operations

The National Renewable Energy Centre is involved in:


### Wind turbine rotor blades

Product certification, verification and investigations for the next generation offshore wind turbines.


### Power trains and components

3MW and 15MW facilities that can perform independent performance and reliability assessments of full systems and components.


### Electrical networks

UKAS accredited laboratories with specialist test and measurement facilities to help develop technologies needed for developing power systems and exploring life extension opportunities for ageing assets.


### Subsea trials and demonstrations

Controlled onshore salt water location for all stages of technology development.


### Resource measurement and assessment

Open access facility for testing, calibrating and verifying remote sensor technologies


## Closed facilities


### Clothier High Voltage Laboratory

The Clothier Electrical Testing Laboratory was opened in 1970 by A. Reyrolle & Company. Narec took over the facility in 2004, to use it to test the robustness of electrical infrastructure offshore locations to onshore sites.

Although one of the few high voltage testing facilities in the world,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ the facility was closed by Narec in 2011 due to a lack of government funding. Many parts of the lab were relocated to Narec's main campus in Blyth. The ruins of the original lab are now the property of Siemens.


## Current facilities


### Charles Parsons Technology Centre

Built in 2004, this £5m facility contains a low voltage electrical laboratory for the testing of connecting renewable energy systems to the transmission and distribution grid. Some of the equipment and staff from the closed Narec Clothier Electrical Testing Laboratory were moved to this facility.


### Training tower

This is a 27m high tower, for training of offshore wind technicians.


### Dry docks

Tests marine devices with three modified dry docks.


### Power train test facilities – 3MW and 15MW

Facilities that can perform independent performance and reliability assessments of full systems and components.


### Blade test 1 & 2

The blade testing facilities at National Renewable Energy Centre are designed to test wind turbine blades up to 100m in length. Blades are tested using a Compact Resonant Mass (CRM) system. ORE Catapult is working on a technique of blade testing known as "Dual Axis".


## European funded research

ORE Catapult is involved in a number of European funded research projects including Tidal EC, Optimus and LIFES50+.
