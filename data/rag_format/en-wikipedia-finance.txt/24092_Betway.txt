## World record jackpot

In October 2015, Betway paid out €17,879,645 ($20,062,600; £13,209,300) to Jon Heywood (UK) for hitting the jackpot on Microgaming's Mega Moolah slot while playing at Betway. This was verified by Guinness World Records, at the time, as the largest ever jackpot payout in an online slot machine, subsequently surpassed in 2019.



## Regulation and compliance

The company disbanded their 'VIP' department in 2019 following headlines surrounding the use of these departments to encourage high-rolling customers to continue using gambling products.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In March 2020, Betway was fined a then record £11.6m for historical failings in customer protection and anti-money laundering checks, allowing one customer to deposit over £8m and lose over £4m in a four-year period.

In June 2020, Betway announced that they would be the first betting company to ban player transfer and managerial job betting in football, following high-profile cases that had linked the markets to manipulation and corruption across the industry.

In the United States, Betway is present in Virginia, Colorado, Indiana, New Jersey, Iowa, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. Users in all states can also play the free Betway Big Pick app to win money without gambling.
