# List of African stock exchanges



There are 29 exchanges in Africa, representing 38 nations' capital markets.

21 of the 29 stock exchanges in Africa are members of the African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA). ASEA members are indicated below by an asterisk (\*).

The Egyptian Exchange (EGX), founded in 1883, is the oldest stock exchange in Africa. One of the oldest bourses (exchanges) on the continent is the Casablanca Stock Exchange of Morocco, founded in 1929 and the JSE Limited in 1887 and Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya founded in1954.

Today the top five largest securities exchanges in Africa are Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), Egyptian Exchange (EGX), Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGX), Casablanca stock exchange in Morocco and Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) in Kenya.

There are several notable countries on the continent that do not have a stock exchange. The most notable is Ethiopia, although it does have a commodities exchange in Addis Ababa. In January 2021 a capital market bill was tabled to Ethiopian lawmakers that would establish a stock exchange through a public-private partnership.
