# Anglia Building Society



The **Anglia Building Society** in the United Kingdom was originally formed by the merger of the Northampton Town and County and Leicestershire building societies in 1966. In 1987, it merged with Nationwide Building Society, becoming **Nationwide Anglia Building Society** before reverting to the Nationwide name in 1992.

In 1979, the Grimsby Building Society transferred engagements and in 1980, it once again became known as Anglia Building Society. The London and South of England Building Society transferred engagements in 1983 and the Country (including the engagements of the former Westminster) Building Society transferred in 1984.

In 1987, the Society merged with the Nationwide Building Society, which was formed in London in 1883 and known as the Co-operative Permanent Building Society until 1970. The Nationwide, which traces its dual origins to Northampton, is the largest building society in the world.
