Singapore Power Group


# Singapore Power Group



**Singapore Power Group**, doing business as **SP Group** is a state-owned electricity and gas distribution company in Singapore. SP Group is the corporatised entity of the former electricity and gas departments of the Public Utilities Board (PUB). SP Group was first incorporated as a commercial entity on 1 October 1995 as Singapore Power and Gas to take over the electricity and gas businesses of the state provider, PUB.

Through its subsidiaries, the company is the sole electrical grid and gas grid operator in the country, and provides electricity and gas transmission, distribution services, and market support services to more than a million households in the country. It also provides sustainable energy solutions such as district cooling and heating, electric vehicle (EV) charging network, solar energy solutions and Green Energy Tech solutions for utilities management in Singapore and the region.


## History

PUB was initially located at City Hall. After outgrowing its office space in City Hall, the PUB Building, located near Singapore's main shopping belt of Orchard Road, was built to accommodate several departments of the PUB.

The PUB Building was completed in 1977; construction cost S$32 million. It was renamed as the Singapore Power Building, after PUB's electricity and gas operations were corporatised to Singapore Power on 1 October 1995. The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006, when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters. Instead, it opted to refurbish and reclad the building in silvery metal.

Since 1995, SP Group has been wholly owned by Singapore investment fund Temasek which in turn is wholly owned by the Singapore government.

On 29 January 2007, PUB moved out of the building to join its parent ministry, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, at the Environment Building on Scotts Road.

The company was renamed "SP Group" from 28 February 2017 onwards. SP Group relocated its main office building to Kallang in 2017. It operates a single Customer Service Centre in Toa Payoh.

The lawsuit alleged negligence and breach of duty in the service and maintenance of powerlines controlled by them in the state of Victoria.
