Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009


# Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009



The **Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) Market Investigation Order 2009** is a statutory instrument of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.


## Code of practice

The order sets out a **Groceries Supply Code of Practice**, known informally as the **Groceries Code**, to regulate the relationship between food suppliers and a number of designated large retailers, a list of which is maintained by the government.


### Designated retailers

At the date of the creation of the Code of Practice, the designated retailers were:

* Aldi
* Asda
* Co-operative Group
* Iceland
* Lidl
* Marks & Spencer
* Morrisons
* Sainsbury's
* Tesco
* Waitrose

Since then, the following retailers have been added to the list:

* Amazon
* B&M
* TJ Morris
* Ocado

## Code compliance

The 2019 Order requires each of the designated retailers to appoint a Code Compliance Officer (CCO), who can be contacted by the retailer's suppliers if they have any concerns about compliance with the code. The CCO must be independent of the retailer's buying section and the CCO is expected to deal in confidence with the supplier.
