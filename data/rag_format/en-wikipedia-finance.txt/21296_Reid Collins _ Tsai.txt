## Notable cases

The action alleges a scheme by Renren insiders to wrongfully to take the company’s billion-dollar investment portfolio for themselves (*In re Renren, Inc. Derivative Litigation*, Index Number: 653594/2018, Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, Commercial Division). In both trial court and on appeal, Defendants’ motions to dismiss the case based on issues of personal jurisdiction and standing were denied. In June 2022, the Court approved a $300 million settlement resolving the action, which is one of the largest cash settlements of a derivative action in history.
* The firm represented Plaintiff Claymore Holdings as the assignee of the claims of investment funds managed by Highland Capital Management in a fraudulent inducement and breach of contract lawsuit against global investment bank Credit Suisse related to a Las Vegas real estate development (*Claymore Holdings, LLC vs. Credit Suisse AG, et al.*, Cause No. DC-13-07858, the 134th Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas). In December 2014, a jury found that Credit Suisse fraudulently induced the plaintiff funds into making the investment and awarded $40 million. Following a subsequent three-week bench trial, the trial court also found that Credit Suisse had breached its contractual obligations, and entered a fraud judgment against the bank After subsequent appeals on multiple issues, the Texas Supreme Court affirmed the trial jury's finding that Credit Suisse committed fraud, and remanded the case to the trial court. In June 2021, the trial court awarded $40 million on the primary market loss, plus another $23 million on the secondary market loss. With pre- and post-verdict interest added, and after deducting the value of related settlements reached with other parties, the trial court entered a judgment for $121 million against Credit Suisse.

* In February 2018, the firm won an important ruling on fraudulent transfer law in the U.S. Supreme Court in *Merit Management v. FTI Consulting*.
