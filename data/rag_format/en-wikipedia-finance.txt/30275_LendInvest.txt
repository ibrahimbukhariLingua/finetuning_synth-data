## History

Since 2015, LendInvest has published an independently audited Annual Report on its website. In the year to 31 March 2017, LendInvest reported 20% revenue growth to £40 million and an underlying profit from operations of £2.6 million.

In February 2017, LendInvest published a report entitled "Starting small to build more homes: A blueprint for better policymaking in the property SME market", that revealed that SMEs in the housebuilding sector have been failing at alarming rates, and argues that the government could help to resolve the country's chronic housing shortage by rebooting its strategy to help smaller property firms. The report was formally launched on 21 March 2017 by Conor Burns MP.

In June 2017, LendInvest received a third SQ1 Servicer Quality Rating from European ratings agency ARC Ratings. ARC Rating assesses the process used by LendInvest to originate, underwrite and service property loans.

In September 2016, LendInvest launched the LendInvest Property Development Academy, a non-profit two day course for aspiring property entrepreneurs to learn how to better equip themselves with the skills they need to grow their property development portfolios. Academy courses are held in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Bristol and Birmingham. The Academy was launched in collaboration with the University of Reading and is supported by the Home Builders' Federation. The initiative was attended by the Scottish government in June 2017 when Minister for Housing Kevin Stewart MSP launched the Edinburgh course.

In November 2017, LendInvest launched into the UK Buy-to-Let market and in June 2019 became the first Fintech to securitise its own assets in a £259 million securitisation of Buy-to-Let loans.

LendInvest became a public company in July 2021, listing on the London Stock Exchange's AIM.
