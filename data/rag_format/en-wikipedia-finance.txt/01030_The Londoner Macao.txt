The Londoner Macao


# The Londoner Macao



**The Londoner Macao** (Chinese: 澳門倫敦人) is a casino and resort on the Cotai Strip, in Macau. On August 5th, 2011, Sands China announced that the $4 billion property, long referred to as parcels five and six, would be officially named **Sands Cotai Central** (Chinese: 金沙城中心). The first portion of the resort opened on 11 April 2012. The resort was rebranded as The Londoner Macao in 2021. The resort's redesign was completed in May 2023.


## History


### Development and construction

Architecture firm Aedas was the lead architect for all Las Vegas Sands projects on the Cotai Strip. The firm employed local companies for developing, coordinating and implementing the design. The main contractor was Hsin Chong Construction Group Limited.

In November 2005, Las Vegas Sands announced a deal with Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts for them to manage one hotel tower in the complex, with 500 rooms under their luxury Shangri-La brand and 1,000 rooms under their business-class Traders Hotels brand.

In February 2006, Las Vegas Sands announced a deal with Starwood Hotels to operate two hotel towers in the complex under their Sheraton Hotels brand and a third hotel tower under their luxury St. Regis Hotels brand.

Construction of the project was slowed and complicated in part by government restrictions on how many foreign workers could be hired in the labor-starved territory. According to the main contractor: "Work started in 2006 but the project went through a period of suspension due to the global economic crisis. During this period, work on the project came to a complete stop and it was quite a challenge to restart the project. Staff had to be recruited and contractors engaged. Over 130 contractors were involved in the project. The imported labour quota restrictions have also been challenging."

The number of gaming tables at the resort was a thorny issue as well, since the local government imposed a cap on tables until 2013. The company stated in early August 2011 that Sands Cotai Central would have up to 530 tables versus the 670 it was planning previously.

On March 24th, 2011, Las Vegas Sands announced it had terminated its management agreement with Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts . Then, on August 5th, 2011, Sands China announced that they had signed franchise deals with Hilton Worldwide and InterContinental Hotels to replace Shangri-La and brand over 1,800 rooms at Cotai site 5 and 6 under Hilton's luxury Conrad Hotels brand and InterContinental's Holiday Inn brand.

In addition, on August 5th, 2011 the company also announced that the resort complex would officially be named Sands Cotai Central. The resort would include over 6,000 rooms and suites, two casinos, more than 300,000 square feet (28,000 m²) of meeting space, and 11 food and beverage establishments. It would total 106,000-square-foot (9,800 m²) of gaming area and 13,700,000-square-foot (1,270,000 m²) of non-gaming facilities.


### Opening

The resort complex opened on April 11th, 2012, featuring the four-star **Holiday Inn Macao, Cotai Central**, the world's largest Holiday Inn, with more than 1,200 rooms, and the five-star **Conrad Macao, Cotai Central**, with more than 600 rooms.

The opening ceremony was announced as "Asia's Biggest Launch Party in 2012." It was marked by the feat of high wire walker Jade Kindar-Martin and his wife Karine Mauffrey, traversing the 525 meter (1,700 feet) distance between the top of the Venetian and the new Conrad Hotel, whilst balancing 150 meters (500 feet) above the ground on a wire less than 1 inch (25 mm) thick. The spectacle was accompanied by the China National Symphony Orchestra.

The second phase, consisting of the twin-towered five-star **Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central**, opened on September 20th, 2012. The 4,001-room Sheraton was both the largest hotel in Macau and the largest Sheraton in the world.

The third phase, **The St. Regis Macao, Cotai Central** and branded residences, opened on December 17th, 2015, as the fourth tower of the Sands Cotai Central.

On January 18th, 2016, the Sheraton Macao Hotel, Cotai Central was upgraded to the brand's premium Sheraton Grand tier and renamed **Sheraton Grand Macao Hotel, Cotai Central**.


### Rebranding

In 2017, Las Vegas Sands announced plans to renovate Sands Cotai Central with a London theme and rebrand it as **The Londoner Macao**, due to disappointing results at the property. The Holiday Inn Macao at Cotal Central closed in 2019 and was overhauled and rebranded as The Londoner Hotel with half the number of rooms, and the "Cotai Central" branding was dropped from the St. Regis, Conrad and Sheraton hotels.

The entire complex was officially rebranded The Londoner Macao on February 8th 2021, when the first phase of the renovated property celebrated its grand opening. The first phase includes the opening of The Londoner Hotel, an all-new Crystal Palace atrium featuring a replica of the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, new dining options, and a number of interactive attractions that are themed to London. A British-style exclusive club for guests of The Londoner Hotel, The Residence, also opened its doors as part of Phase 1.

Later phases, progressively completed throughout 2021, includes the Suites by David Beckham situated at the top two floors of The Londoner Hotel, a 370-room Londoner Court, a re-themed and expanded Shoppes at Londoner, and the 6000-seat Londoner Arena. Later phases of the rebranding also saw the completion of the Houses of Parliament facade, a life-sized Big Ben, and a Changing of The Guard show held at the Crystal Palace atrium.

The resort's overall redesign was completed in May 2023 and was marked with a celebration attended by David Beckham, with performances by pianist Lang Lang, Hong Kong pop singer G.E.M., Chinese musical theater performer Ayanga and English singer Jamie Cullum.

In 2024, the two hotel towers under Sheraton branding closed and were renovated, with their 4000 rooms reduced to 2405 rooms, due to the conversion of many rooms into suites. The Sheraton had just 360 suites, while the new property will have 1500 suites. It will be launched under Marriott's Luxury Collection brand as the **Londoner Grand, A Luxury Collection Hotel** in fall 2024, with one tower, while the second tower will reopen in 2025. The Londoner Grand Casino is being renovated at the same time.
