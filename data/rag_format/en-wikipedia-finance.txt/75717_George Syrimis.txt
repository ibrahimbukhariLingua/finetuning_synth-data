## Early life

Syrimis was born in Nicosia, Cyprus. However, his family was originally from Agros, a village in the island's southern Pitsilia region.

He returned to his native Cyprus from the UK in 1948. Syrimis founded his own accounting firm, G. Syrimis & Co. His firm later became part of Peat Marwick, which, in turn, was merged to become KPMG International in 1987. In 1961, Syrimis became a founding member of the Association of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus (ICPAC), later serving as chair of the professional organization.


## Philanthropy

Syrimis was heavily involved in Cypriot charities and philanthropic organizations. An art collector, he sold his pieces to benefit local organizations, including the Cypriot National Guard. He was a member of the Rotary Club of Nicosia, the oldest rotary club in Cyprus.
