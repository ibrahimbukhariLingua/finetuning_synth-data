## Background

In 2008, Eoptolink was founded by Gao Guangrong, an optoelectronics manufacturing veteran.

The company was based in the Shuangliu Southwest Airport Economic Development Zone of Chengdu. According to Gao, the location was near the Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport which allowed Eoptolink products to reach its overseas clients quickly.

On 3 March 2016, Eoptolink held its initial public offering becoming a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

In 2022, Eoptolink acquired US firm, Alpine Optoelectronics for its silicon photonics technology.

In June 2024, it was reported that Eoptolink shares had significantly risen in part due to the AI boom caused by Nvidia.

On 22 December 2024, Eoptolink announced Gao was under investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission for suspected violation of stock transfer regulations.
