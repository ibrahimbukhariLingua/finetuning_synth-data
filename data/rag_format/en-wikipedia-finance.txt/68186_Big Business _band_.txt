Big Business (band)


# Big Business (band)



**Big Business** is an American stoner/sludge metal band founded in 2004 by bassist/vocalist Jared Warren (Karp) and drummer Coady Willis (The Murder City Devils). They formed in Seattle, Washington and have been based in Los Angeles, California since 2006. Their music is characterized by a bombastic and frantic style, and for most of their existence Big Business has been a bass-drums duo with occasional other musicians contributing.


## History

The band released its first Tour EP and the vinyl version of their first album, *Head for the Shallow*, on January 25, 2005, through Wäntage USA. The CD version of *Head For the Shallow* was released by Hydra Head Records, the first of a three album run.

In late 2006, after relocating to Los Angeles, Jared and Coady both became members of the Melvins, first appearing on *(A) Senile Animal*. The tour, titled "the Double-Drumming Rock for Peace tour", featured Warren and Willis playing a set as Big Business before being joined by Crover and Osborne for a set as the Melvins. While on tour, Big Business played with frequent Melvins collaborator David Scott Stone who would later play guitar and Minimoog Voyager on all songs from their 2007 release *Here Come the Waterworks*.

After releasing *Here Come the Waterworks* to critical acclaim, Big Business was given an opening spot on the summer leg of the Tool tour. Toshi Kasai played guitar for Big Business throughout this tour.

After the fall US tour ended, Big Business started recording material for the new Melvins album, entitled *Nude with Boots*, which was released on July 8, 2008.

On March 9, 2008, guitarist/keyboardist Toshi Kasai was introduced onstage as the third member of Big Business. Both the band and Toshi verified this addition on their respective Myspace pages. Big Business released their third album *Mind the Drift* on May 12, 2009. The album was produced by Phil Ek who has produced both of their previous albums.

In October 2010, after a year of not playing any concerts, they posted on their Myspace that they had added another guitarist, Scott Martin (400 Blows, Crom), officially making them a "Power Quartet".

They toured the summer of 2011 with Torche and Thrones.

Big Business toured with Red Fang and American Sharks in the spring of 2014. In 2016, the release *Command Your Weather* (2016) was issued by Joyful Noise Recordings / Gold Metal Records.

Around 2016, Warren and Willis were no longer part of Melvins. At this same time, Big Business began touring as a two piece once again without any specific announcement or press regarding changes from the earlier trio and quartet lineups.

Their latest release, *The Beast You Are*, was issued by Joyful Noise Recordings / Gold Metal Records.

In April 2019, drummer Coady Willis appeared on the podcast *Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal* to discuss the making of *The Beast You Are* and a general career retrospective for Big Business and his other musical projects. He also appeared on an episode of *The Vinyl Guide* around the same time. In 2020, Jared Warren also participated in a long form career spanning interview on *Protonic Reversal*, speaking about the *Whip* reissues, Big Business, his time with the Melvins and much more.
