Florida TaxWatch


# Florida TaxWatch



**Florida TaxWatch** is an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit taxpayer research institute located in Tallahassee, Florida. Founded in 1979 as the Citizens Council for Budget Research, Florida TaxWatch conducts research aimed at improving government efficiency and accountability. Florida TaxWatch is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit educational and research organization. Since 1982, the organization has been led by President and CEO Dominic M. Calabro.

Instead of Centers of Excellence, Florida TaxWatch operates two research institutes:

* **The Census Institute** - Focuses on the implications and importance of census data for policy-making and resource allocation in Florida.
* **The Institute of Quality Health and Aging** - Dedicated to improving the health and well-being of Florida's aging population through research.

Additionally, Florida TaxWatch oversees the **Citizenship Institute**, an applied learning program distinct from traditional research efforts. This program offers 3-4 days of intensive instruction from a diverse group of experts including current or former agency heads, legislators, distinguished university professors, and other state and local officials. Among the prominent instructors is Floridaâ€™s 40th Governor, Bob Martinez. With a class size limited to 15-20 participants, the Citizenship Institute focuses on practical government interaction and policy impact, significantly differing from conventional leadership programs.


## History

In 1977, incoming Florida Senate President Phil Lewis approached Mark Hollis, then Vice President of Publix Super Markets, about the business community coming to the Florida Legislature to seek increases in consumer taxes rather than finding ways to hold the line on spending. Following this discussion, the two decided that a state government watchdog was needed.

An organizational meeting convened in Tampa two years later resulted in the formation of the Citizens Council for Budget Research, which five years later was renamed Florida TaxWatch. The founders were Winn-Dixie Chairman J.E. Davis, T. Wayne Davis, Publix Super Markets founder George Jenkins and President Mark Hollis, and Florida State Senator Phil Lewis and Florida State Senator Ken Plante.

Florida TaxWatch is currently located in the former St. James Christian Methodist Episcopal church. Built in 1899, the church was constructed on land purchased by black members of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church and was, at one point, the oldest African-American church in Tallahassee.
