On 24 February 2022, Etisalat Group launched a new brand identity called **e&**. The group also announced that it will keep the previous branding identity in the UAE and internationally.


## History

Etisalat was founded in 1976 as a joint-stock company between International Aeradio Limited, a British Company, and local partners. In 1983, the ownership structure changed – United Arab Emirates government held a 60% share in the company and the remaining 40% were publicly traded.

In 1991, the UAE central government issued Federal Law No. 1, which gave the corporation the right to provide the telecommunications wired and wireless services in the country and between UAE and other countries. It also gave the firm the right to issue licenses for owning, importing, manufacturing, using, or operating telecommunication equipment. This practically gave Etisalat both regulatory and control powers, which completed the monopoly of the telecom giant in the UAE. In order to safeguard the country's economic development, the law made provisions for the development of the telecommunication sector in the country.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The increase of exchange lines from 36,000 in 1976 to more than 737,000 in 1998 was one of the important indicators of Etisalat network's growth and development. Today Etisalat stands 140th among the Financial Times Top 500 Corporations in the world in terms of market capitalisation, and is ranked by The Middle East magazine as the 6th largest company in the Middle East in terms of capitalization and revenues. The Corporation is the largest contributor outside the oil sector to the development programmes of the UAE Federal Government.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Etisalat has also won accolades from across the region for its nationalization programme. In November 2013, it was also announced that Etisalat would be the official sponsor of Cyprus First Division side Anorthosis Famagusta.


## e&

e& is headquartered in Abu Dhabi and includes three regional offices – Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Northern Emirates. The Northern Emirates regional center is based in Sharjah and covers the telecom's operations in the emirates of Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah, and Ras Al Khaimah.

In the UAE, e& operates where mobile penetration is already among the highest in the world "200%", Etisalat became known for its efforts to roll out its Fibre-To-The-Home (FTTH) network in the UAE. By the end of 2009, Etisalat had completed the FTTH roll-out for 85% of households in Abu Dhabi, positioning the UAE's capital as the first in the world to be covered by fibre.

Some of the Internet services for home users that Etisalat offers include:

* 3G Mobile Internet access
* 4G Mobile Internet access
* Broadband Internet services (Al Shamil and eLife)
* Prepaid and post-paid dialup Internet access
* Cloud gaming services in partnership with Gamestream

e& also operates iZone, a system of Wi-Fi hotspots in central locations, such as shopping malls, restaurants, and sheesha cafes. iZone can be accessed by either purchasing prepaid cards or using an existing account. Dial-up and ISDN Internet access services are billed by the hour, whereas the domestic and residential cable and DSL connections have a fixed monthly rate depending on speed. Etisalat has launched different internet packages for residential customers such as; Elife 10G and 5G, Ultra Fusion, and eLife Family. Other Internet links, aimed at business users, have traffic utilization plans and relatively high rates when exceeding the allocated bandwidth quota. This has caused bad publicity for Etisalat and is a major source of criticism. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In addition to its telecommunication service provider and carrier units, e& incorporates a number of additional non-telecom business units under the umbrella of Etisalat Services Holding LLC. These units support the company's operations and even provide services to other operators and organizations in the UAE, namely: training and consultancy services (Etisalat Academy), SIM/smart card manufacturing and payment solutions (Ebtikar), data clearing house services (EDCH), peering/voice and data transit (Emirates Internet Exchange – EMIX), call center (The Contact Centre), cable TV (eVision), facilities management (EFM), as well as submarine cable laying services (eMarine).

Etisalat is a major investor in Thuraya (34.5%), a satellite geo-mobile communication systems provider. In 2006 Etisalat started a major restructuring program that resulted in the de-merger of many of its non-core business units operating under the telecom's centralized and direct management; core services were consolidated and streamlined, reflecting the company's shift from a technology-driven telecom to a customer-focused services provider. As part of the program, Etisalat launched a re-branding campaign, releasing a new corporate logo and identity in May 2006. The restructuring culminated in the incorporation of Etisalat Services Holding LLC, which as of 2008 oversees the operation of Etisalat's non-telecom business units with huge success stories. On 27 March 2016, Saleh Al Abdooli was appointed the Group CEO, extending his responsibility to international operations. Al Abdooli resigned from the organization for personal reasons in May 2020 and Hatem Dowidar was appointed as the interim Group CEO who was later confirmed as the Group CEO on 16 December 2020.

On 1 June 2013, Etisalat introduced free local and national HD calls across the UAE. Later that week, corporate, private, public, and government sectors in the country were provided with better business IT solutions when Etisalat launched its first cloud service in the UAE.

* e&'s telecommunications division in the UAE recently announced a groundbreaking achievement, setting a new world record for the fastest speed on a live 5G network, reaching 30.5 Gbps.

* This milestone was revealed during a demonstration at the 2024 SAMENA Leaders' Summit, where e& showcased the successful carrier aggregation of high-band and mid-band spectrums (1600 MHz in mm Wave and 300 MHz in C-band), achieving unprecedented network speeds of 30.5 Gbps.

## International presence

Etisalat International Investments was the business unit of Etisalat that operated telecom operations outside the UAE and managed the corporation's stakes in telecommunications carriers in Afghanistan, Egypt, Niger, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. The International Investments unit, and its management team, were re-structured into Etisalat Group, and Ahmad Abdulkarim Julfar was appointed as Group CEO in 2011, followed by Saleh Al Abdooli in 2016.

As of July 2021, Etisalat has presence and operations in 15 countries outside the United Arab Emirates.

As of 2023, Etisalat owns a stake of 14.6% in Vodafone Group one of Europe's largest telecommunication groups. In 2024, the British government warned that e&’s association with Vodafone poses a national security risk. Robert Buckland and Oliver Dowden also urged for measures to address national security concerns. They also asked for the establishment of an independent committee to monitor the risks associated with the stake held by e& in Vodafone. Dowden said the committee should consist of Vodafone employees, while Buckland said the it should be independent of both e& and Vodafone. Buckland said the committee members should be experts in national security, telecoms and human rights, pointing at the UAE’s “history of repressive activity and espionage”.

Etisalat also has a stake in PPF Telecom Group with a percentage of 50.1% which is active in Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia and Slovakia as a telecommunications provider under the brand Yettel. In June 2024, Brussels announced its first anti-subsidy investigation, targeting e&’s €2.2bn deal to acquire PPF group’s telecoms assets that was approved by national competition regulators. The European commission was concerned that to complete the acquisition, e& received state funds, amounting to unfair subsidies. Another concern was if the state funds would allow E& to outperform the EU rivals and undermine the competition.

## Controversies


### VoIP ban

The United Arab Emirates blocks many popular voice over IP services like Skype. The only licensed VoIP service is BOTIM, which is operated by Etisalat.


### BlackBerry controversy

In July 2009, Etisalat pushed an update to BlackBerry devices operating on the telecom's national network, citing performance improvements. However, it was later discovered that the update contained eavesdropping software, developed by the US-based software development company SS8, which specializes in electronic surveillance. It is reported that the software enabled the company to monitor and forward communications on BlackBerry devices to their servers. Research in Motion, BlackBerry's developer, acknowledged that the patch was a form of spyware, and issued a removal patch on 20 July.

On 27 December 2009, both Etisalat and du have been mandated by the UAE telecom regulator to start filtering BlackBerry users' web access and block illegal content. Due to concerns with the security and the provisioning of legal interception for Blackberry non-voice services, on 1 August 2010, the Telecommunication Regularity Authority of the UAE instructed Etisalat that all Blackberry e-mail, internet and messenger functions must be suspended on 1 October 2010. However, an agreement between Blackberry's developer Research in Motion and UAE's telecom regulator has been reached, and the announced BlackBerry services suspension has been canceled.


### Etisalat Iran

In January 2009 Etisalat in consortium with Tamin Telecom (a subsidiary of the Iranian Social Security Organization (SSO)) won the bid for running the third mobile services operator in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The license included an exclusive two-year agreement for 3G services provisioning, but in Sep 2009 the license was revoked and given to its local partner, Tamin Telecom.

Etisalat had planned to invest over billion (AED 18.39 billion) over a period of five years, but following the license suspension all plans for launching operations in Iran have been put on hold.


### Etisalat India

In 2009, Etisalat announced that its Indian unit, erstwhile Swan Telecom (owned by Dynamix Balwas Realty and Reliance Communications), headquartered in Mumbai, is renamed to Etisalat DB Telecom India Pvt. Ltd. The business unit has been awarded Unified Services Access License in 15 telecom circles (Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Mumbai, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu (including Chennai), Uttar Pradesh (East), Uttar Pradesh (West), Madhya Pradesh and Bihar). The brand name was "Cheers Mobile".

In April 2010, Etisalat began signal testing in Chennai [IND 922], Delhi & NCR [IND 913], Maharashtra & Goa [IND 919], Mumbai [IND 916], and Gujarat [IND 914]. In May 2010, Etisalat was in talks to buy a 25% stake in Reliance Communications, but the deal was not finalised.

In 2010, following the billion 2G spectrum case, Etisalat DB, the Indian subsidiary of the company, was stopped from buying a stake in a Chennai-based company due to objections raised by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Etisalat DB was not allowed to buy back the 5.27 percent stake held by Chennai-based Genex Exim Ventures since the home ministry raised objections based largely on security concerns. The MHA had pointed out four issues that needed to be resolved before allowing the company to come into Etisalat DB, a company that got scarce 2G spectrum at allegedly throwaway prices.

It raised objections about Etisalat's presence in Pakistan and its connection with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI. Etisalat owns a 26% stake in Pakistan Telecommunications and has a subscriber base of 3 million in Afghanistan. The MHA has also expressed concerns about the telecom surveillance software Etisalat had used in a Blackberry service it had introduced in the UAE and recommended that the company should not be allowed to offer Blackberry services in India.

On 22 February 2012, Etisalat announced that it will cease operations in India post-cancellation of its licenses by the Supreme Court of India. It issued notice to its subscribers, giving them 30 days to change operators. On 5 September 2012, Etisalat announced that it would not bid for spectrum in the November 2012 2G spectrum auction. In a released statement the company said, "Etisalat Group has decided not to participate in the auction as it is not willing to re-participate after being canceled its owned licenses. Following the publication by the Department of Telecomm (DoT) – India’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology of the information memorandum for the planned auction of spectrum in 1800 MHz and 800 MHz bands, the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat) wishes to confirm that it has decided not to participate in the auction".
