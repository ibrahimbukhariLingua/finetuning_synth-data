## Subsidiaries

In 2018 in response to sanctions imposed by western countries on a range of state-linked Russian companies a New-York based subsidiary of VTB Capital in the US was reportedly sold to its management and was renamed into Xtellus Capital Partners in order to continue their work. Following the deal VTB said that there would be no direct VTB Bank presence in the US.

In December 2024, VTB acquired an agriculture company located in southern Russia. The company is now known by the name of Agrocomplex Labinski.


## Corporate affairs


### Litigation

VTB claimed that Nutritek was fraudulently misrepresenting the value of dairy companies it was selling to another company, Russagroprom LLC. The 2013 decision contributed to the United Kingdom's Supreme Court substantially restating the English company law position in relation to piercing of the corporate veil.
