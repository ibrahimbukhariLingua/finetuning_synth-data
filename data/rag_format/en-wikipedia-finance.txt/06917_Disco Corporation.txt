The company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a component of the Nikkei 225 index.


## History

The company was founded as Daiichi-Seitosho in May 1937, as an industrial abrasive wheel manufacturer.

After World War II Japan faced a construction boom which also helped DISCO to boost its sales. The company's grinder discs were in high demand from utility companies, which needed them to manufacture watt-meters.

In December 1968 the company developed and released an ultra-thin resinoid cutting wheel, *Microncut*. The wheel contained diamond powder and as a result it was capable of making sharp, precision cuts as demanded in the semiconductor manufacturing process. There were no cutting machines available in the market on which ultra-thin precision wheels could be mounted and run, DISCO decided to develop its own machine in 1975. The cutting machine, DAD-2h, received instant recognition from semiconductor companies, including Texas Instruments.

The company adopted the name of DISCO Corporation in May 1977, was listed with the Japan Securities Dealers' Association in October 1989, and entered the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 1999.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
