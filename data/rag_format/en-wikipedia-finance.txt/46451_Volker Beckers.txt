### RWE npower

Volker Beckers was RWE npower's Group CFO from 2003 to 2009. In January 2010 he became chief executive. Volker was Group CEO of RWE Npower plc until the end of 2012.

Whilst at the Big Six company, he successfully oversaw substantial investment in the UK generation fleet, with the completion of two efficient gas-fired power stations – Staythorpe and Pembroke – as well as its customer service platform and the sale of Horizon Nuclear Power.

In 2012 it was announced that RWE npower would start commercial operations of its 2,000 megawatt (MW) gas-fired power station at Pembroke.

Npower had already announced that the 1 billion pound ($1.6 billion) combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station would become operational during the third quarter of 2012 but had not cited a specific month.

“With the full commercial operation of our new 1 billion pounds power station in Pembrokeshire next month ... RWE npower now has the largest and most efficient fleet of flexible gas-fired power stations in the country,” Volker Beckers, group CEO RWE npower said at the presentation of its second-quarter results.

For his efforts as a leader in the industry he has been recognised in 2012 with the Supreme Award for “outstanding contribution to the industry” and as the first Executive Director of the UK energy sector.

Commenting on his award, Volker Beckers said: “I am honoured to have been recognised for my contributions to the industry. There are a lot of challenges and changes ahead for energy in the UK and further afield, but having seen the hard work, dedication and innovation of those working in the sector on a day-to-day basis, I have no doubt the industry will rise to meet them.”
