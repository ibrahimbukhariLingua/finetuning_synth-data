# Tirlán



**Tirlán** (known as **Glanbia Co-operative Society Limited** from 1999 until 2022) is an Irish dairy co-operative based in Kilkenny, Ireland. Its catchment area mainly covers the South-East and Midland regions of Ireland. Tirlán processes an annual volume of 3.2 billion litres of milk and handles 190,000 tonnes of green grain.

As of 2024 it has 2,300 employees and revenues of €2.53 billion. Tirlán is divided into three main business divisions; Agribusiness (Retail stores and farm services), Consumer (consumer brands) and Ingredients (value added solutions).

Glanbia plc will retain and continue to operate under the Glanbia name as an entirely separate entity. Tirlán will remain the largest shareholder in Glanbia plc, with a 31.9% shareholding.


## History

The co-operative has its roots in a series of amalgamations of small rural co-operative creamery societies throughout Counties Tipperary, Kilkenny, Laois and Kildare who went onto form Avonmore Creameries Federation in 1966.

The creamery became a success story that emerged from the dedication and cooperation among farmers, management, workers and the community at large. Each of the 36 creameries became a branch of Avonmore creamery. Apart from milk collection, creameries provided invaluable services to the farming communities, including butter making, on site shops, grain drying and milling, and agricultural contract work


### The Glanbia Collection

According to Glanbia Collections in Kilkenny Archives at St Kieran's College, Kilkenny, Avonmore Creameries Federation, the predecessor to Glanbia Co-operative Society Limited and Tirlán was created through the amalgamation of the following Village Creameries that are included among their archives for:

### 1960-1983 – Formation of Avonmore and Waterford

Co-operatives faced major downsides in that they lacked significant capital raising instruments that allowed for expansion and development and also the legal and financial protection afforded by corporate structures. To realise the benefits of scale and diversification, the 1960s many of these small, locally focused co-operative Creameries across Ireland amalgamated. Waterford Co-op Society was formed in 1964 upon the amalgamation of Kilmeaden Co-operative, Carrick on Suir Co-operative, Dungarvan Co-operative, Gaultier Co-operative and Rathgormack Co-operative.

Avonmore Creameries Federation was founded in 1966 when 36 smaller co-ops joined forces. The following year, Avonmore entered into a joint venture with Unigate Limited to construct the largest dairy processing facility in Europe at that time at Ballyragget, and would become Ireland's largest milk producer by the 1970s.


### 1984-1996 – Flotation and expansion

After the introduction of European milk quotas in 1984, the domestic growth opportunities for Irish co-operatives and their members were very limited. Waterford Co-op Society and Avonmore Creameries both realised that to expand they would have to seek out new markets from outside of Ireland. The best way to fund such an expansion they recognised was through a stock market flotation. Accordingly, Avonmore Foods plc was floated on the Irish Stock Exchange on 6 September 1988 and Waterford Foods plc were floated a month later on 6 October 1988. This provided the funding to expand their product offerings while also expanding their geographic footprint.

Avonmore Foods plc acquired a number of small cheese plants in the US to form a platform for their market-leading US Cheese business that is part of Glanbia plc today.


### 1997-2000 – The amalgamation

After their flotations in 1988, Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc pursued similar growth strategies. It made commercial sense for both amalgamate. On 4 September 1997 Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc merge to form Avonmore Waterford Group (AWG) plc. After agreement was reached in a special general meeting in Waterford attended by almost 3,200 of the Waterford Co-op's 5,000 shareholders, a joint statement of the Chairmen read: "It would lead to an Irish, farmer-controlled food company with the scale and resources to successfully compete in a highly competitive international marketplace". The company became the fourth biggest dairy processor in Europe and the fourth biggest cheese producer in the world.

In 1999, the business was rebranded Glanbia plc which means “pure food” in Irish.


### 2001-2023 - Glanbia Ireland Takeover

Between 2001 and 2004 Glanbia implemented a significant reorganisation aimed at reshaping its portfolio and providing the foundation for future growth. In 2008 they decided to vertically integrate with the acquisition of a customer, Optimum Nutrition. In 2013 Glanbia Ingredients Ireland purchased Wexford Creamery for €20 Million.

In 2017 Glanbia Ireland was created. This company managed the network of over 11 production facilities and 52 Agri retail branches. This entity was owned by Glanbia Co-operative who controlled a 60% share and 40% by Glanbia plc.

In 2021, the members of the co-operative approved the takeover of Glanbia Ireland along with its dairy processing business. The sale completed in April 2022 which marked the return of direct ownership of the dairy processing business to its farmer-members. Subsequently both the co-coperative and Glanbia Ireland rebranded as Tirlán to differentiate themselves from Glanbia PLC.


## Naming Controversy

Following the rebranding to Tirlán the company faced criticism from Irish speakers over the spelling of the Co-operatives new name. The name Tirlán according to the company stands for “Land of Abundance”. The name is a combination of the Irish words “Tír” which stands for land or territory and “Lán” which stands for full. Irish language speakers argued that “Tír” means country but “Tir” without the síneadh fada is not a recognised word in the Irish language. It was also pointed out that the Irish word for abundance is ‘neart’ or ‘flúirse’ and not “lán”.


## Brands

Tirlán today owns well known Irish consumer brands.

Avonmore is the flagship brand for the group. Their product range includes fresh milk, butter, cream, soup, rice and custard.

Fresh milk is still sold under a number of legacy brands that were bought by Tirlán that have strong geographic ties to certain areas : Premier Dairies in the Greater Dublin Area, Snowcream who were based in the South-East Region, Ireland and Midland Region, Ireland, CMP who were based around Cork.

There are two major cheese brands that the group sell called Kilmeaden cheese and Wexford Creamery.

They have launched a new consumer brand in the United States, "Truly Grass Fed" range focusing on the sale of grass fed cheese and butter. Their "Truly Gluten Free" range was launched in 2024 and focuses on Gluten Free Oat Milk from their 110 Irish Family farm suppliers.
