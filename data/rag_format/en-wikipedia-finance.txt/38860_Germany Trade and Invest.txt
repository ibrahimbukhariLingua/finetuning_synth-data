# Germany Trade and Invest



**Germany Trade and Invest - Gesellschaft für Außenwirtschaft und Standortmarketing mbH** **(GTAI)**, the successor to the German Office for Foreign Trade (bfai) since January 1, 2009, is a limited liability company (GmbH) wholly owned by the federal government of Germany; it is assigned to the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The company currently has over 400 employees, including over 80 abroad. Important partners of the organization are the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the KfW, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit and the federal government and its ministries.


## History

The company was founded in 1951 as the *Bundesauskunftsstelle für den Außenhandel* (Federal Foreign Trade Information Office, BfA) and renamed in 1953 as the *Bundesstelle für Außenhandelsinformation* (Federal Foreign Trade Information Office) with headquarters in Cologne. In 1960, the *Gesellschaft für Außenhandelsinformationen mbH* (GfAI) was founded as a subsidiary of the Federal Agency for Foreign Trade Information. All foreign correspondents reporting for the BfA were henceforth employed by this company.

In 2001 the Federal Agency for Foreign Trade Information (BfAI) was renamed to the Federal Agency for Foreign Trade (*Bundesagentur für Außenwirtschaft*, BfAI). In 2003, the *Gesellschaft zur Unterstützung des Beauftragten für Auslandsinvestitionen mbH* was renamed *Invest in Germany GmbH*. Invest in Germany was the official location marketing agency for foreign investments, while the Federal Agency for Foreign Trade promoted exports. On January 1, 2009, a new economic development agency was created by merging the Federal Agency for Foreign Trade (bfai), the Society for Foreign Trade Information (*Gesellschaft für Außenhandelsinformationen*, GfAI) and Invest in Germany GmbH into Germany Trade and Invest.
