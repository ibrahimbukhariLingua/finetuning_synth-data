## Cirquent UK

Cirquent Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary of Cirquent GmbH, was founded in the UK, as Softlab Ltd., in 1989, to sell and support the Maestro I product line. Initially based in Hammersmith, the company expanded with the launch of Maestro II, a software development environment used by British Gas plc and Barclays Bank.

Softlab was purchased by BMW AG in the 1990s and following the purchase of Rover Group by BMW, Softlab Ltd. acquired AT&T Istel's Rover Group services, increasing in size from about 60 staff to one of over 500. With the acquisition came a move of headquarters near Birmingham. The business moved from software tools to CRM and Contact center system integration. In 2001, BMW Group sold Rover, and soon after the automotive team was sold to Computer Sciences Corporation.

Softlab continued to focus on CRM software and contact centre projects, partnering with Microsoft (Dynamics CRM), Oracle (Siebel), Genesys, Interactive Intelligence, CDC (Pivotal) and BMC (Remedy). Following acquisitions, in 2008, Softlab was rebranded Cirquent.

In 2008, a majority 72.9% stake in Cirquent was taken by NTT Data.
