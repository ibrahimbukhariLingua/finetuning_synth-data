## Later career

Upon graduation from Nigerian Law School, Lagos, Ighodalo worked as an Associate in the law firm of Chris Ogunbanjo & Co between 1985 and 1991, and in 1991 he set up Banwo & Ighodalo, in partnership with Femi Olubanwo. The firm is consistently ranked as a leading Nigerian law firm in the areas of Capital Markets, Securities, Mergers & Acquisitions.

In 2014, Ighodalo successfully advised Zenith Bank Plc in connection with a US$500 million eurobond issuance and Diamond Bank Plc in connection with a US$200 million eurobond issuance respectively.

He resigned from all corporate positions he held to aspire to become the governor of Edo State.

On February 22, 2024, Ighodalo emerged as the People's Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the 2024 Edo State governorship election. However, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja nullified election on the ground that 378 delegates who were to vote during primary election were unlawfully denied their rights to vote.

His candidacy was eventually upheld by the Federal High Court in Abuja, which confirmed Ighodalo as the legitimately nominated governorship candidate of the PDP in Edo State, and dismissed the lawsuit challenging his nomination.

He lost the election to the APC candidate, Monday Okpebholo, but has challenged the election results on the basis of non-compliance with the Electoral Act.
