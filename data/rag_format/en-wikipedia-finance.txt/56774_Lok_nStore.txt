## History

Lok'nStore was founded in February 1995 from one freehold store in Horsham, by Andrew Jacobs. Five years later, in May 2000, the business became a public company known as Lok'NStore Group PLC.

In 2003, the company received a takeover approach valued at around £33m, which was rejected by the Board. The company received a further takeover approach in 2009, which also did not proceed.

In December 2018, the company purchased the existing storage business 'The Box Room' in Hedge End, Southampton. The Box Room building was then rebranded as an orange Lok'nStore centre.

In February 2019, Lok'nStore Group PLC sold a document-storage business, Saracen Datastore Ltd, to Iron Mountain UK PLC for £7.6 million in order to pay down debt and help fund future acquisition and development plans.
