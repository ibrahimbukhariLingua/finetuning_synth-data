Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965


# Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965



The **Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965** (c. 12) was an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that regulated industrial and provident societies in Great Britain and the Channel Islands.

From 1 August 2014 it was repealed and replaced by the consolidating Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014.

The Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 2010 contained a provision that would have renamed the act the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies and Credit Unions Act 1965, but this was repealed on 1 August 2014 before coming into force.


## History

In the UK, and some Commonwealth countries, many co-operatives are registered as industrial and provident societies.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Since 2014 the applicable laws now explicitly name co-operatives and community benefit societies in their titles.

In January 2012 the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron announced a project to consolidate all the legislation applicable to industrial and provident societies. There was some uncertainty as to how far new developments would address the problems with the legislation. In mid-2012, revision of laws for co-operative was in its early stages. The enactment of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 completed the reform process.


## Jurisdiction

This legislation applies in Great Britain (England, Wales, and Scotland). Northern Ireland has its own very similar legislation. The 1965 and 1968 acts also apply to Jersey and Guernsey.
