## History

Diamond Trust Bank (Tanzania) Limited (DTB Tanzania) was founded in 1945, as Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (DJIT) with its head office in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) and branches in Mombasa (Kenya) and Kampala (Uganda). Subsequently, branches were also opened in Nairobi and Kisumu in Kenya. At the time, DJIT operated as a community-based finance house offering savings and extending credit to members of the Ismaili Community.

In 1965, DJIT was divided into three companies – DJIT Tanzania, DJIT Kenya and DJIT Uganda with the respective head offices in Dar es Salaam, Nairobi and Kampala. DJIT Tanzania changed its name to Diamond Trust of Tanzania (DTT) in 1990. Under the name change, the Bank extended its facilities from a community-based finance house into a non-bank financial institution, and began offering financial services to the general public.

DTT was recapitalized in 1995 through injection of funds by its shareholders. Diamond Trust Bank Kenya and the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) emerged as its two principal shareholders, holding 33% and 31% shareholding respectively. In 1997, DTT was licensed as a full commercial bank and changed its name to Diamond Trust Bank Tanzania Limited (DTBT). DTBT was declared as a public limited company in 2022 and now known as Diamond Trust Bank Tanzania Public Limited Company (DTBT Plc).
