Abu Dhabi Investment Authority


# Abu Dhabi Investment Authority



The **Abu Dhabi Investment Authority** (Arabic: جهاز أبوظبي للاستثمار, **ADIA**) is a sovereign wealth fund owned by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, founded to invest funds on behalf of the Government of Abu Dhabi. It manages the emirate's excess oil reserves and is estimated to manage $1,057 billion. ADIA is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world.

ADIA's operations have been characterized as secretive and opaque.


## History

In 1967, Abu Dhabi emirate created the Financial Investments Board which operated within its Department of Finance and was responsible for managing the Emirate's excess oil revenues. However, in 1976, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founding president of the United Arab Emirates, converted it into the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The goal was to invest the Abu Dhabi government's surpluses across various asset classes, with low risk. At the time it was novel for a government to invest its reserves in anything other than gold or short-term credit. Even today, investment in short-term paper remains the strategy for the vast majority of countries.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal of the 1990s, ADIA reportedly lost hundreds of millions of dollars.

The operations of ADIA have historically and to the present been secretive and opaque.

The fund is a member of the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds.


## Strategy

ADIA manages a substantial amount of capital and is one of the world's largest investment funds. Due to its size, the fund has been influential in international finance. In 2008, ADIA co-chaired the International Working Group of 26 sovereign wealth funds that produced the "Generally Accepted Principles and Practices of sovereign wealth funds" (known as the Santiago Principles). These principles were created to demonstrate to home and recipient countries and the international financial markets that sovereign wealth funds had robust internal frameworks and governance practices and that their investments were made only on an economic and financial basis.

Today ADIA invests in all the international markets — equities, fixed income and treasury, infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and alternatives (hedge funds and commodity trading advisers — CTAs). ADIA's global portfolio is broken down into sub-funds covering a specific asset class. Each asset class has its own fund managers and in-house analysts covering it. Almost every asset class is managed both internally and externally. Overall between 70% and 80% of the organization's assets are managed outside, and over the last few years, the fund has become more indexed which given its unique asset liability structure is somewhat perplexing. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) is a major purchaser of U.S. institutional real estate through various sub-entities. It often buys partial interest ownerships with leading real estate managers. ADIA also invests in development projects including malls.

Many of ADIA's investments have decreased substantially since investments were made at market peaks in 2007 and 2008. The $7 billion investment in Citigroup has lost approximately 90% of its value as of 26 November 2009, 2 years after it acquired a sizable stake in the bank. Its investments in global real-estate at the market top in 2008 have also decreased substantially in value. Though it talks of its long-term success in generating returns, the fact that it has moved closer to the index and manages most of its funds through external third-party fund managers shows that its tolerance for risk-taking has greatly diminished over the years. However, ADIA's ratio of third-party fund managers is being actively managed. In 2006, between 70% and 80% of the organization's assets were managed outside with an aim to bring that down to between 60% and 70%. In the year 2005, Abu Dhabi Investment Company purchased 51 percent of shares of Massar (Company) from Abu Dhabi Power Corporation, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Water & Electricity Authority.

On 27 May 2013, ADIA published its 2012 Review, with an overview of its activities during the past year as well as an explanation of its approach to investing – strategy, governance, and risk management.

In 2019, ADIA announced that it would be investing over $1 billion into Saudi Aramco's initial public offering. In 2020 the AIDA disclosed a share of $615 million in Cheniere Energry.

In 2024, AIDA invested $1.7 billion into Fisher Investments together with Lunate, $2.8 billion into Trans-Java Toll Roads with INA and APG, as well as $5.6 billion into NetCo SRL together with CDP Eq and CPP.

Tawreed Investments is a subsidiary of ADIA that has investments in several Australian infrastructure projects including Queensland Motorways, TransGrid, and WestConnex.
