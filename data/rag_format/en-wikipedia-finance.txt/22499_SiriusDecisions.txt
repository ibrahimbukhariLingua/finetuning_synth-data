# SiriusDecisions



**SiriusDecisions, Inc.** was a global B2B research and advisory firm with headquarters in Wilton, Connecticut. The company provided advisory, consulting and learning services to help executives improve the performance of their sales, marketing, and product strategies.

SiriusDecisions developed the "Demand Waterfall" model, which is widely used by B2B companies to describe and measure their lead-to-revenue funnel.

SiriusDecisions clients included Adobe, IBM, GE, HP, Cisco; SAP; and Motorola. Forrester Research acquired the company in 2018.


## Company history

SiriusDecisions was founded in 2001 by John Neeson and Rich Eldh.

SiriusDecisions helped define many business marketing best practices and concepts, including lead scoring and marketing operations. Since 2005, the company's "Demand Waterfall**®**" model, (updated in 2012 to "The Rearchitected Demand Waterfall" and then to the "Demand Unit Waterfall™" in 2017) has been used by marketers to analyze their lead qualification process, from the inquiry stages through closed sales. The model introduced prominent B2B marketing terms, including marketing qualified lead (MQL) and sales qualified lead (SQL).

SiriusDecisions announced January 8, 2014, that it had received an investment from JMI Equity.

Headquartered in Wilton, CT, the company also had offices in London, Toronto, San Francisco, Waltham, Massachusetts, Austin and Singapore.

On November 27, 2018, the company announced that it was acquired by Forrester Research.
