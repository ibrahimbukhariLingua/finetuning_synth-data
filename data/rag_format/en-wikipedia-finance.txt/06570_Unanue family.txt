## Politics

The family supported Michelle Obama in 2012 with MyPlate, an initiative to encourage Hispanics and African Americans to eat balanced meals.

In July 2020, Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue visited the White House and pledged one million cans of Goya chickpeas to food banks, saying "Americans are truly blessed to have a leader like Donald Trump." The comments sparked some negative reactions and calls for a boycott of Goya Foods, which in turn sparked counter-boycotts in support of Goya.

On 7 December 2020, CEO Robert Unanue stated that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was named "employee of the month" after her boycott call led to a tenfold sales spike.

On January 20, 2021, Goya Foods CEO Robert Unanue claimed on Fox Business that the novel coronavirus was used by the Democratic party, media, and technology elites to control the American public and steal the 2020 US presidential election: “I think this is mission accomplished — mission accomplished by the union, the partnership, the conglomerate of social media, Big Tech, big media, and government, big government — for ushering in the dawn of a new world order, this Great Reset, with an unverified election.” In the same interview, Unanue also claimed that the coronavirus would disappear soon after the inauguration of Joe Biden: “There is a war coming, now that the president is leaving today, there's still coming after the United States, the working class. They've decimated the working class this year by shutting down the economy.”

On January 25, 2021, Robert Unanue was censured by Goya's board of directors after he made unfounded public claims about voter fraud during and after the 2020 presidential election. He is not allowed to speak to the press in regard to the politics of the company without permission from the board.

In February 2021, in a speech given at CPAC, Robert Unanue continued to deny the results of the 2020 election, falsely stating that Trump was "the real, the legitimate, and still the actual president of the United States”. Unanue also stated "We still have faith that the majority of the people in the United States voted for the president," despite Biden defeating Trump by more than 7 million votes.

Robert Unanue also spoke on the first night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and during a Donald Trump rally hosted by Turning Point USA in Glendale, Arizona.
