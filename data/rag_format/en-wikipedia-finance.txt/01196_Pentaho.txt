## Products


### Pentaho Data Optimizer (PDO)

Pentaho Data Optimizer allows organizations to intelligently manage, maintain and tier their data based on its business value, the cost of managing it, and regulatory requirements. It reduces data-related expenses, meets performance and compliance demands, and supports sustainability initiatives. It uses the auto-discovery features of the Pentaho Data Catalog to achieve this.


### Pentaho Data Catalog (PDC)

In March 2020 and June 2021 Hitachi Vantara acquired Waterline Data and Io-Taho respectively, and amalgamated the best of both into its Pentaho Data Catalog (PDC). PDC automatically finds, analyzes, and tags structured and unstructured data and contextualizes it with business glossary terms and governance policies.


### Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) & Pentaho Business Analytics (PBA).

Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) and Pentaho Business Analytics (PBA) use a Java framework to create Business Intelligence solutions. Although most known for its Business Analysis Server (formerly known as Business Intelligence Server), the PDI/PBA software is indeed a couple of Java classes with specific functionality. On top of those Java classes one can build any BI solution.

The only exception to this model is the ETL tool Pentaho Data Integration - PDI (formerly known as Kettle.) PDI is a set of software used to design data flows that can be run either in a server or standalone processes. PDI encompasses Kitchen, a job and transformation runner, and Spoon, a graphical user interface to design such jobs and transformations.

Features such as reporting and OLAP are achieved by integrating sub-projects into the PDI/PBA framework, like Mondrian OLAP engine and jFree Report. For some time by now those projects have been brought into Pentaho's curating. Some of those subprojects even have standalone clients like Pentaho Report Designer, a front-end for jFree Reports, and Pentaho Schema Workbench, a GUI to write XMLs used by Mondrian to serve OLAP cubes.

Pentaho offers enterprise and community editions of those PDI software. The enterprise software is obtained through an annual subscription and contains extra features and support not found in the community edition. PDI & PBA's core offering is frequently enhanced by add-on products, usually in the form of plug-ins, from the company and the broader community of users.


#### Server applications

Pentaho Enterprise Edition (EE) and Pentaho Community Edition (CE).

| Product | Offering | Type | Recent version (EE) | Recent version (CE) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Pentaho BA Platform** | EE, CE | Server application | 7.1 | 7.1 | Commonly referred to as the BI Platform, and recently renamed Business Analytics Platform (BA Platform), makes up the core software piece that hosts content created both in the server itself through plug-ins or files published to the server from the desktop applications. It includes features for managing security, running reports, displaying dashboards, report bursting, scripted business rules, OLAP analysis and scheduling out of the box. Commercial plug-ins from Pentaho expand out-of-the-box features. A few open-source plug-in projects also expand capabilities of the server. The Pentaho BA Platform runs in the Apache Java Application Server. It can be embedded into other Java Application Servers. |
| **Pentaho Analysis Services (Mondrian)** | EE, CE | Server application | 3.7.0 | 3.6.1 | Pentaho Analysis Services, codenamed Mondrian, is an open-source OLAP (online analytical processing) server, written in Java. It supports the MDX (multidimensional expressions) query language and the XML for Analysis and olap4j interface specifications. It reads from SQL and other data sources and aggregates data in a memory cache. Mondrian can be run separately from the Pentaho BI Platform, but is always bundled with the platform itself in both EE and CE versions. |
| **Pentaho Dashboard Designer (PDD)** | EE | Server plug-in | 5.0.6 | - | A commercial plug-in provided to enterprise edition (EE) subscribers. It allows users to create dashboards, which are collections of other content components displayed together with the goal of providing a centralized view of key performance indicators (KPI)s and other business data movements, letting users monitor them and make decisions. Content components are usually individual Information graphics, tables, OLAP views or reports. The plug-in simplifies dashboard creation through the use of layout templates, drag-and-drop interaction and a GUI for providing parameters and inputs to dashboard components. |
| **Pentaho Analysis (Analyzer) (PAZ)** | EE | Server plug-in | 5.0.6 | - | The Pentaho Analyzer plug-in provides a web-based, drag-and-drop OLAP viewer. It allows a user to visually create MDX queries by dragging parts of a previously defined Mondrian OLAP schema onto a canvas, where other activities can take place like filtering, sorting, creating calculated members from other measures, exporting the result table to PDF or MS Excel, and optionally graphing the data. It is also known to work on Apple iPads by using the Safari web browser. |
| **Pentaho Interactive Reporting (PIR)** | EE | Server plug-in | 5.0.6 | - | This plug-in enables users to create ad hoc reports in a visual drag-and-drop fashion. |
| **Pentaho Data Access Wizard** | EE, CE | Server plug-in | - | - | This plug-in is bundled with all servers and allows users to create new data sources for use throughout the system from other databases or CSV files uploaded to the server while using a setup wizard. During the steps of creating a data source users also are given a chance to create a data model describing how columns or fields relate to each other creating hierarchies of relationships like Time: Year, Quarters, Months, Weeks and Product Division, Category, Type etc. The resultant model is used by Mondrian and any other plug-in like Analyzer or Saiku to create new queries against the newly created data source. This component is part of what Pentaho introduces as agile BI, which simply means having a way to start from basic data and quickly iterate through steps to discover the proper way to structure, study and present the data. |
| **Pentaho Mobile** | EE | Server piece | 5.0.6 | - | A new addition since 4.5-GA suite that is a user interface adapted for use with the Apple iPad. It exposes all of the major functionality of OLAP analysis and running of reports and dashboards that allow greater interaction on a small, touchscreen. Mobile also adds features for bookmarking favorite content for easy access and the concept of opening several pieces of content in tabs. |

It allows executing ETL jobs in and out of big data environments such as Apache Hadoop or Hadoop distributions such as Amazon, Cloudera, EMC Greenplum, MapR, and Hortonworks. It also supports NoSQL data sources such as MongoDB and HBase. |
| **Pentaho Report Designer** | EE, CE | Desktop application | 9.0.0.0-423 | Pentaho Report Designer is a visual, banded report writer. Features include using subreports, charts and graphs. It can query and use data from many sources including SQL, MDX, Community Data Access, scripting, static table definitions and more. It consists of a core reporting engine, capable of generating reports based on an XML definition file stored in a Zip (file format) with a .PRPT extension. Many tools have been developed surrounding the reporting engine, including GUI designers and ad hoc wizards that guide the user through a step-by-step process of creating a report, using solely graphical tools without the need to write any code. |
| **Pentaho Data Mining** | EE, CE | Desktop application | Weka | Pentaho Data Mining used the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) to search data for patterns. Weka consists of machine learning algorithms for a broad set of data mining tasks. It contains functions for data processing, regression analysis, classification methods, cluster analysis, and visualization. Based on the discovered patterns, users can predict future trends. |
| **Pentaho Metadata Editor (PME)** | EE, CE | Desktop application | 9.0.0.0-423 | The metadata editor is used to create business models and act as an abstraction layer from the underlying data sources. The resulting metadata models are used by Pentaho Interactive Reporting, Saiku Reporting, and Pentaho's legacy AD HOC reporting plug-in applications to create reports within the BA server without using any of the other external desktop applications. |
| **Pentaho Aggregate Designer (PAD)** | EE, CE | Desktop application | download 9.0.0.0-423 | Aggregate Designer operates on Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian) XML schema files and the database with the underlying tables described by the schema to generate precalculated, aggregated answers to speed up analysis work and MDX queries executed against Mondrian. This is accomplished by the software examining the hierarchies described in the schema and the measures also defined there and generating SQL which would result in the creation of tables storing those answers away for future use by Mondrian. After using the software to generate these aggregate tables, the original Mondrian XML schema file describing the OLAP cube is modified to reference the precomputed results. |
| **Pentaho Schema Workbench (PSW)** | EE, CE | Desktop application | 9.0.0.0-423 | Pentaho Schema Workbench provides a graphical interface for designing OLAP cubes for Pentaho Analysis (Mondrian). The schema created is stored as a regular XML file on disk. It is not necessary to use the Schema Workbench to create schema, but it is often helpful for beginners and even experts who need go inspect a cube visually and come up to speed with how to maintain or extend it. |
| **Pentaho Design Studio (PDS)** | EE, CE | Desktop application | 4. | The Pentaho BA Server supports special XML scripts called xactions to implement business logic and other forms of automation in the platform. Design Studio is a modified version of the Eclipse Development Environment with a plug-in designed to understand the components supported by xaction scripts. Xactions are very powerful, and useful, but sometimes prove difficult to troubleshoot because of the low-level way they interact with parts of the BA server. Developers are starting to use Pentaho Data Integration transformation files to carry out automation and business logic tasks. The transformations can be run directly by the BA Server and visually debugged in Pentaho Data Integration (PDI) and are quickly gaining favor in the community over xactions. It is a small leap to imagine PDI transformations will eventually replace xactions entirely. |
