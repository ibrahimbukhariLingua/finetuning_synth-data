## Corruption schemes


### Pricing difference

Personal wealth Loktionova, according to various estimates, not less than 700 million dollars. At the same time, according to officially filed tax returns, Loktionov's income amounted to $2.5 million. According to media reports, the cost of Loktionov's mansion on Rublevka is $100 million, and the total value of foreign and Russian real estate is $450 million. Sales of gasoline by Highlander International Trading provoked losses at Rosneft:

* 1 million 194 thousand US dollars in 2002;
* 4 million 711 thousand US dollars in 2003;
* 10 million US dollars in 2005.

### Stock repurchase

It is reported that Loktionov stole from the company Rosneft cash in the amount of 280 million US dollars. He applied a stock repurchase system. Having initially acquired Rosneft shares through Sintez for $20 million, he transferred them to his other organization, Highlander International Trading. After that, he sold the shares back to Rosneft for $300 million.


### Tender at the Komsomolsk Refinery

When the Komsomolsk refinery owned by Rosneft was loaded, the company periodically purchased resources from third-party producers in volumes up to 150 thousand tons of oil per month. At the same time, Anatoly Loktionov arranged a "tender": $10 from each ton of oil was personally in his hands to get a contract. Thus, the monthly income of Anatoly Loktionov in this scheme probably reached $1.5 million or $18 million annually.


## Criminal proceedings

In 2011, he became the defendant in a criminal case on a knowingly false denunciation (part 2 of article 306 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), in 2012 the Tagansky district court elected a preventive measure in the form of taking into custody. In connection with this case, Loktionov was forced to hide outside the Russian Federation, and in 2014 he demanded to transfer a new passport to him, submitting an application to the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow.

In 2015, Loktionov became a defendant in yet another criminal case on fraud on a large scale (part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). The case was opened by the Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Krasnodar in 2015 against the employees of the Stroyklass company, who stole 6.65 million rubles from the shareholder of the DB Development development company Dmitry Garkusha. According to investigators, Dmitry Garkusha, suffered a total damage of 101.6 million rubles.

Dmitry Garkusha invested money in the construction of the residential complex "High Coast" in Anapa. He also owned 20% of Stroyklass LLC, controlled by Loktionov, and in 2008 allocated $4 million and 6.65 million Russian rubles for the construction of Vysokoy Bereg. The construction of the LCD was frozen. As a result, in order to settle the obligations, the parties concluded an agreement on the joint sale of the project. Loktionov received the right to negotiate the sale of a 100% stake in Stroyklass, but he did not find a buyer, as a result of which neither his share in Stroyklass nor money was returned. In 2013, Loktionova was put on the federal wanted list. In 2016, he was already on the international wanted list due to the fact that it became known that Anatoly Loktionov lives in London. In 2018, Loktionov admitted his guilt and agreed to cooperate with the investigation, as a result of which he was included in the "Titov list", due to which he was able to return to his homeland.

After returning to Russia, Loktionov began to participate in investigative actions, but however, the criminal investigation against him is still ongoing, and the charges have not been dropped.

The return to Russia is attributed to the fact that the UK passed the Criminal Finances Act. It provides for the introduction of UWO (Unexplained Wealth Orders) – "Orders for wealth of unknown origin". This tool allows the authorities to demand from the owners of any suspicious assets worth over 50 thousand pounds sterling an explanation of their origin. Possible arrest of property if the owner can not prove the legality of the origin of their income."

Loktionov interested in the authorities of France and (Germany). For a fee of 2.5 million euros, they were given information about HSBC's customers. All of these clients opened bank accounts in 1990–2007, with a total of over $100 billion in deposits. German, French and Belgian prosecutors became interested in this list, suspecting that Russian citizens were hiding from paying taxes. It is noted that Anatoly Loktionov indicated to the bank as his place of residence "a house in the fashionable suburb of Geneva – Vandovre on Ruth de la Capit, 140. Information from the Geneva registry confirms that the land belongs to Loktionov and his wife. There is a two-storied mansion with a small artificial pond on the site near Lake Geneva."
