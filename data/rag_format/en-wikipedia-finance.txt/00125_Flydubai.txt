# Flydubai



**Dubai Aviation Corporation** (Arabic: مؤسسة دبي للطيران), doing business as **flydubai** (Arabic: فلاي دبي), is an Emirati government-owned low-cost airline based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The airline mainly operates out of Terminal 2 at Dubai International Airport, though some flights fly out from Terminal 3. The airline operates a total of 124 destinations, serving the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Europe from Dubai. The company slogan is *Get Going*.


## History


### Foundation and early years

In July 2008, the government of Dubai established the airline. Although Flydubai is not part of The Emirates Group, Emirates supported Flydubai during the initial establishing phase.

On 14 July 2008, Flydubai signed a firm order with American aircraft manufacturer Boeing at the Farnborough Air Show for 50 Boeing 737-800s with a total value of US$3.74 billion, with the option to change the order to the larger and longer range Boeing 737-900ER, according to the airline's demand.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The first of these aircraft was delivered on 17 May 2009. Scheduled flights commenced on 1 June, with services to Beirut, Lebanon, and Amman, Jordan. Since then, the route network has been significantly expanded.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Development since 2015

On 13 February 2013, Flydubai announced that it was in talks with Boeing and Airbus for a 50-aircraft order. On 19 June 2013, the airline announced that it would be adding business class service to its flights. The business class cabin would feature 12 seats between aisle and window, three-course meals, 12-inch televisions, a business class lounge, Italian leather seats to its offering in a bid to cater to business travellers in the emirate, access to more than 200 films, and power outlets suitable for plugs from over 170 countries.

In March 2019, Flydubai suffered considerable losses due to the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft around the world. The state-owned company claims that its growth strategy was severely impacted by the incident, as it had 11 of these aircraft and more than 220 on order. Company CEO Ghaith Al-Ghaith said that an interim settlement agreement was made with Boeing for certain compensation but details of the agreement remain confidential.

On November 4, 2020, FlyDubai announced that it would start direct flights between Tel Aviv and Dubai from November 26, with tickets being offered on sale. This would mark the first commercial flight route between Dubai and Tel Aviv. During the Israel-Hamas war, many airlines interrupted their flights to Tel Aviv airport; but flydubai and Etihad Airways kept up multiple flights daily, helping Israel remain connected to the wider world. This was a symbol of "UAE’s commitment" to maintaining strong ties with Israel.
