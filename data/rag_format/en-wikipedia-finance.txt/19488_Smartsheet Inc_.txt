# Smartsheet Inc.



**Smartsheet Inc.** is an American privately held company that develops and markets the Smartsheet application. As of 2023, it had over 3,000 employees, and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The company was founded in the summer of 2005, shortly after co-founder Brent Frei sold his prior company, Onyx Software. Initially it was funded mostly by Frei. About a year after its founding, Smartsheet had raised $4 million in funding and had just nine employees. By early 2012 it had raised $8.2 million in funding over three rounds and hired its first salesperson. The company went public in 2018 via an initial public offering and in 2025 was taken private again by private equity firms Blackstone Inc. and Vista Equity Partners.

After the Smartsheet software was redesigned in 2010, the company's revenues grew by more than 100 percent each year, for four consecutive years. It raised $26 million in funding in December 2012 and another $35 million in May 2014. In 2017, the company raised an additional $52.1 million in funding. In 2018, it was announced that Smartsheet acquired Converse.AI, a Scotland-based company that develops software for creating business automation bots.

The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 27, 2018. In May 2019, Smartsheet announced it had acquired 10,000Â ft, a SaaS platform that provides real-time resource and capacity planning.

In September 2024, Vista Equity Partners and Blackstone announced their intent to buy Smartsheet for $8.4 billion in cash, at $56.50 per share. The acquisition was completed in January 2025.
