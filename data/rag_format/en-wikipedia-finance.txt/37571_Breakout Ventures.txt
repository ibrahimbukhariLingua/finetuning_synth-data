Breakout Ventures


# Breakout Ventures



**Breakout Ventures**, formerly **Breakout Labs**, is a venture capital firm affiliated with the Thiel Foundation (a philanthropic organization created by Peter Thiel).

Breakout Labs issued convertible grants for early-stage commercialization of scientific research that was considered too speculative or long-term to interest the for-profit sector (such as angel investors and venture capitalists) but may have been unsuitable for traditional sources of funding for scientific research due to its radical or offbeat nature. Grants were made through a competitive application and selection process.
