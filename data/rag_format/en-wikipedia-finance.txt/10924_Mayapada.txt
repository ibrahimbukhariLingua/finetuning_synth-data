# Mayapada



The **Mayapada Group** is an Indonesian-based conglomerate founded by Dato Sri Tahir in 1986. Tahir started this with a garment and textile manufacturing business, and four years later, he founded **Bank Mayapada** . The garment business no longer exists. The bank went public at the Jakarta Stock Exchange and survived the 1997 economic crisis and managed to expand further after the crisis. With foreign investment partners from the US, UAE and Singapore, the bank now has over 100 branches throughout Indonesia, and in 2007 has been voted as the second best public bank outside state-owned banks by InfoBank magazine, a banking magazine in Indonesia.
Mayapada also concerns;

* The retail industry through partnership with **Duty Free Shoppers** owned by LVMH, with shops in Jakarta and Bali.
* The property industry with four office towers in the Jakarta CBD area, **Mayapada Tower**, **Menara Topas**, **Permata Tower 1** and **Sona Topas Tower**. In Bali, Mayapada developed Mal Bali Galleria, the largest mall in the island, and all-suites Regent Bali Hotel and Residence in Sanur district.
* The healthcare industry, running a hospital and building another one called **Mayapada Hospital**.

Tahir is a Christian and lives in Jakarta with his family. He has also been appointed to the board of trustees at the University of California, Berkeley, becoming the first man from Southeast Asia to hold this position. Through the Tahir Foundation, Tahir has made charitable donations to numerous fields including healthcare, education, legal reformation and has contributed a combined $200 million investment alongside the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation into tacking social and welfare problems in Indonesia.

Tahir earned his MBA from Golden Gate University in 1987. His doctorate is an honorary degree from the University of Surabaya in 2008.


## Donation

In April 2011, Tahir donated $1 million to the University of California, Berkeley, for international student fellowships for students in the full-time MBA program at Berkeley-Haas. He was a member of the university's board of trustees.
