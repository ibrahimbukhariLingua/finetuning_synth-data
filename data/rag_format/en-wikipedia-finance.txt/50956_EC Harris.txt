## History

Founded in 1911 by Edward Charles Harris, EC Harris began as a multi industry consultancy business. By the 1950s, the business was largely property based, focusing on civil engineering and infrastructure development. It was in 1986 that the company started Europe's first facilities management consultancy services, and in 1996, the business began to offer full life cycle capital project and facilities consultancy.

In 2003, EC Harris became a limited liability partnership (LLP). EC Harris merged with Arcadis NV on 2 November 2011, after a vote of EC Harris' 183 partners on 31 October 2011. This grew the work force EC Harris had access to over 21,000 professionals as a subsidiary of Arcadis. The merger led to an 84% boost in Arcadis' revenues in August 2012.
