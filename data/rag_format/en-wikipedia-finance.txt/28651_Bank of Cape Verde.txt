## History

The government established the Bank of Cape Verde in 1975, as a bank that combined commercial banking and central banking functions. The government created the bank by nationalizing the operations of the Portuguese colonial and overseas bank, Banco Nacional Ultramarino, which had established its first branch in Cape Verde in 1865. In 1993, the government split off the commercial banking functions into the newly established Banco Comercial do Atlântico.
