One Percent for the Planet


# One Percent for the Planet



**One Percent for the Planet** is an international organization whose members contribute at least one percent of their annual revenue to environmental causes to protect the environment. Founded by Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, and Craig Mathews, owner of Blue Ribbon Flies in 2002, the organization encourages "more businesses to donate 1% of sales to environmental groups".

Since its creation, the organization has been joined by countries around the world, with a great number of partners in France, Great Britain, Australia, and Japan. France is the only country to have an independent entity.
