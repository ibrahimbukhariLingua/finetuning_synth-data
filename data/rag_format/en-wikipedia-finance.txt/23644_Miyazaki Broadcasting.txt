## History

On May 30, 1953, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunicationsannounced the frequency allocation plan for broadcasting in Miyazaki Prefecture. However, at that time, no industry in Miyazaki Prefecture was interested in applying to establish a private radio station³–⁴ Minaminihon Radio (now Minaminihon Broadcasting) from neighboring Kagoshima Prefecture intended to build a relay station in Miyazaki and starting its broadcasts in the prefecture.⁴ There was a strong reaction against Yamaguchi Toma, the then president of Hyuga Nichi Shimbun (now Miyazaki Nichi Shimbun), and he joined forces with politicians and financial figures in Miyazaki Prefecture to apply for the establishment of a private radio station.⁴–⁵ On December 17 of the same year, Radio Miyazaki (ラジオ宮崎) applied for a broadcasting license,⁶ held a founding conference on March 17 of the following year, and registered the company on the 24th.¹¹ At 5:20 in the morning on July 1, 1954, Radio Miyazaki officially started broadcasting.¹⁵ Initially it broadcast on 1490 kc, but the station faced interference from Radio Yamanashi and the AFN Far East Network station in Gunsan, who both used the same frequency. To avoid direct interference, the station moved to 1480 kc (the only such occupier of said frequency in Japan at the time) on October 1, 1956.³⁰ The Nobeoka relay station opened in November 1956 and the Miyakonojo relay station in May 1958.³⁰ Thanks to the frequency change and the opening of the relay stations, the service area increased.

Radio Miyazaki applied for a television broadcast license on June 25, 1956.³⁹ In order to expand the coverage of radio waves, Miyazaki TV chose to build a signal transmitting station on the top of Mt. Crozuka with an altitude of 1,119 meters. It was also a rare attempt in Japan to build a signal transmitting station on the top of the mountain at that time.³⁹ At the same time, Radio Miyazaki also increased the number of employees and built a television broadcast hall to meet the hardware and manpower requirements for broadcasting television.⁴⁰–⁴¹ On October 1, 1960, Radio Miyazaki officially began broadcasting its television station⁴¹ and joined the JNN network.⁵² The following year, in order to reflect the actual situation of concurrent broadcasting and television operations, Radio Miyazaki changed its company name to Miyazaki Broadcasting, the abbreviation changed from the old RMK to the current MRT.⁴⁵ In 1962, Miyazaki Broadcasting achieved a 10% stock dividend.⁴⁵ In 1964, the 10th anniversary of its founding, Miyazaki Broadcasting renovated the Broadcasting Center and broadcast many commemorative special programs.⁴⁶–⁴⁷ On December 10, 1966, Miyazaki Broadcasting started broadcasting in color.⁵³

In 1977, Miyazaki Broadcasting began to introduce the electronic news gathering (ENG) system.¹⁸⁵–¹⁸⁶ In the same year, Miyazaki Broadcasting decided to build a new building in the center of Miyazaki,⁷¹–⁷³ and construction started in 1982.⁷⁵ To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the broadcast and as part of corporate identity , Miyazaki Broadcasting launched the second generation trademark in 1984.⁷⁵–⁷⁶ At the end of August of the same year, the new Miyazaki Broadcasting Center was completed. The building has one floor underground and seven floors above ground, with a total floor area of 12,700 square meters and a cost of 3.3 billion yen.⁸¹ The first to third floors of the building are the commercial and cultural facilities MRT micc; the fourth to seventh floors are the office spaces of Miyazaki Broadcasting, of which the fourth floor is a broadcast recording studio and the fifth floor is a television studio.⁸¹–⁸ Starting from September 1 of the same year, Miyazaki Broadcasting began to broadcast programs from the new headquarters.⁸⁴–⁸⁶

Miyazaki Broadcasting began broadcasting digital TV signals on December 1, 2006, and ended broadcasting analog TV signals on July 24, 2011. In 2014, Miyazaki Broadcasting launched a new logo on the occasion of its 60th anniversary.
