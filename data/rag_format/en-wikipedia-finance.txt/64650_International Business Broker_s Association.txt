International Business Broker's Association


# International Business Broker's Association



**The International Business Brokers Association (IBBA)** is a non-profit association operating for people and firms engaged in business brokerage and mergers and acquisitions in the US and Canada. This association provides business brokers with education, conferences, professional designations, and networking opportunities. The IBBA was formed in 1983, and most members are based in the US and Canada, though there are a few from elsewhere in the world. The IBBA strives to create a professional relationship with successful business transaction advisors (i.e., CPAs, bankers, attorneys, and other related associations), to increase the image and value of the IBBA to its members, and to be a leader in the exchange of business referrals.

The minimum annual fee for an individual to be a member of the IBBA is $475. IBBA offers a directory of business brokers on their site. It portrays itself as an international directory, but it is focused almost exclusively on business brokers in North America. IBBA has an arrangement with a business listing site, BizBuySell, which allows the IBBA to publish all BizBuySell's listings under the IBBA banner.


## Function

The IBBA provides educational courses for business brokers. It awards the Certified Business Intermediary (CBI) certification and runs the courses and seminars required to obtain this certification. Certified Business Intermediary (CBI) is the designation awarded to IBBA members who satisfy educational requirements and adhere to IBBA's standards.
