# Dohop



**Dohop** is a booking service that focuses on cheap international flights. It began as a successful Icelandic technology startup company, tailoring a solution to the problem of how to stitch together different flights on different airlines, which helps budget travellers.
Dohop also offers ConnectSure, a self-transfer protection that covers the traveller in case of a disruption to a connected flight.


## History

Founded in 2004 and based in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland as a travel search engine to aggregate and link low-cost flight connections, in 2005, Dohop launched the world's first flight planner for low-cost airlines and later expanded it to include all scheduled flights worldwide, amounting to 660 airlines.

Dohop was primarily a long tail aggregation agent that does not sell flights directly to the consumer, but refers the user to an airline's booking engines. Dohop's income comes from pay per click advertising and from selling specialized search engines to airlines and airports. The company also operates an analytics department, offering route network analysis and optimization suggestions to airlines and airports.

Dohop also drew income thanks to its technological license on its concept of a search engine. In 2012, Dohop opened an affiliation program. Professionals can set up a Dohop-identified flight search engine on their own website.


## Recognition

In 2006, the company won Travelmole's Web Awards in the category for best technology site, and was selected as one of the Times Magazine 100 best travel sites in 2007.

In 2014, Dohop won the World's Leading Flight Comparison Website award at the World Travel Awards and subsequently won the award three years in a row in 2016, 2017, and 2018.

Dohop has since transitioned to becoming a technology provider for the aviation and travel industry, building virtual interline connections for airlines such as easyJet and Air Transat, as well as intermodal technologies connecting easyJet and Deutsche Bahn through Berlin Brandenburg Airport.
