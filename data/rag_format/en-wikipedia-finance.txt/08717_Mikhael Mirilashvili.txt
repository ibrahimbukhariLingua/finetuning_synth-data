## Kidnapping incident

Mirilashvili's elderly father was kidnapped on a highway in August 2000 while driving in his Lexus LS, by a group pretending to be traffic police. The group was apparently unaware of who they had kidnapped and had not seen the logo of the family's casino company on the numberplate. A couple of days later, he was returned safely. Two weeks later, the dead bodies of those responsible for the kidnapping, along with their girlfriends and driver, were found near Isaakievskiy (Saint Isaac's) Square.

Russian authorities arrested Mikhael Mirilashvili (the son) and charged him with kidnapping in March 2001. According to the case details, Mirilashvili ordered the security service to find mafia members who had abducted his family,ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and as a result, mafia members were kidnapped to be delivered to the office of the company "Petromir", which belongs to the family. There, under torture, they told the coordinates of kidnappers of Mirilashvili-senior, then after his release they too were executed. The original kidnappers themselves were later found dead in Saint Isaac's Square.

A group of well-known Russian figures including Andrei Petrov, Oleg Basilashvili, Mikhail Boyarsky and poet and singer Alexander Rosenbaum protested the City Prosecutor’s Office’s illegal methods of investigation applied in this case. On 1 August 2003, The Leningrad District Military Court sentenced Mirilashvili to serve eight years in prison. Mirilashvili stated that the testimony of court expert Sergei Koval was an act of revenge and should be thrown out because of his personal interest in the case. Koval’s wife, Tatyana, was asked to resign at the Mirilashvili-owned Conti group as a result of not doing her job properly. While in prison, Mirilashvili fought the sentencing at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. The court declared that the taking and examination of the evidence was done in an unfair manner and had not satisfied the requirements of a fair hearing. In 2009, Mirilashvili was released from prison and returned to Israel and Saint-Petersburg.
