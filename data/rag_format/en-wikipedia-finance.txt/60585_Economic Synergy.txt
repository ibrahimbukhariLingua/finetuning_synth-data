Economic Synergy


# Economic Synergy



**Economic Synergy** (also known as **3L**) was a political party in Hong Kong, composed of three members of the Legislative Council, Andrew Leung, Jeffrey Lam and Lau Wong-fat.


## History

Formerly members of the Liberal Party, Jeffrey Lam, Andrew Leung and Sophie Leung resigned on 8 October 2008, saying they had not been able to communicate with the party, and were dissatisfied with its handling of the aftermath of its poor showing in the 2008 LegCo election. The three of them constituted half of the Liberal Party's representation in LegCo. Another Liberal Party Lau Wong-fat joined the group as a consultant soon after the group was set up, and therefore the group is sometimes referred to as the **4L**.

In October 2012, the group formed the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong with other LegCo members from the pro-business sectors.
