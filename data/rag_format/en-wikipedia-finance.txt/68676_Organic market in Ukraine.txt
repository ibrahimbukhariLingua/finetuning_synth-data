Organic market in Ukraine


# Organic market in Ukraine



**Organic market in Ukraine** is a segment of the economy aimed at the production, circulation and consumption of organic products. The organic market in Ukraine includes the cultivation, production and/or circulation of various agri-food products in accordance with the organic production standards established by Ukrainian and/or international legislation. This market is an important segment of the Ukrainian agriculture and consumer market, which contributes to the preservation of the environment, maintenance of soil, plant, animal and human health, and development of sustainable agriculture.


## Domestic market for organic products

In Ukraine, as of 31 December 2022, the total area of agricultural land under organic production and in-conversion is 263,619 hectares (0.6% of the total area of agricultural land in Ukraine), including the area of organic agricultural land – 246,126 hectares, the area of agricultural land in-conversion – 17,493 hectares. The total number of operators is 462, including 380 agricultural producers.

In recent years, before 24 February 2022, the domestic market increased in sales and the range of organic products continued to expand.

Due to Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, domestic sales of Ukrainian organic products decreased by 36% in volume (6,280 tons) and 48% in value (about US$17 million) in 2022 compared to 2021.

The range of Ukrainian organic products on the domestic market includes milk and dairy products, vegetables, fruits and mushrooms, cereals and groats, flour, seeds, snacks, eggs, meat products, juices, beverages, pastes, canned products, oils, condiments and spices, sugar and other products, including bakery products, varenyky (dumplings with different fillings), pelmeni (meat dumplings), honey, chocolate, and tea and coffee.


## Export of Ukrainian organic products

During 2022, despite the full-scale war Ukraine exported 245,600 metric tons of organic products in the amount of US$219 million to 36 countries around the world, which is almost the same as in 2021 (261,000 metric tonnes, US$222 million). 95% of organic products from Ukraine were exported to European countries. Most products were exported by rail and road. Export volumes by vessels decreased, in particular, air transportation for export from Ukraine became impossible.

The largest importing countries of Ukrainian organic products in 2022 were the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Lithuania, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic. Ukrainian organic producers also exported to some countries in Asia and North America.

The most exported organic products from Ukraine included corn, soybeans, and wheat. Other exports included sunflower oil, sunflower cake, sunflower seeds, frozen blueberries, barley, rapeseed, millet, and other products.

According to the European Commission's Report, in 2022, Ukraine ranked the 3rd out of 125 countries by volume of organic products imported to the EU. Thus, in 2022, the EU imported 2.73 million tonnes of organic agri-food products, including 219 thousand tonnes (8%) from Ukraine, which is 85% of total Ukrainian organic export. Thus, Ukraine had leading positions among the exporting countries to the EU, having exported 93 thousand tonnes (77.1%) of cereals (excluding wheat and rice) and 20 thousand tonnes (22%) of organic oilseeds (excluding soybeans).


## Legislative regulation of the organic market in Ukraine

As of March 2024, organic production in Ukraine is regulated by the Law of Ukraine "On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products", as well as relevant by-laws.

Regarding the history of development and implementation of organic legislation in Ukraine, initially, on 21 April 2011, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law "On Organic Production". The document defined the legal, economic, social and organisational framework for organic agriculture, requirements for growing, producing, processing, certification, labelling, transporting, storing and selling organic products and raw materials. But this law was not implemented.

In 2014, the Law "On the Production and Circulation of Organic Agricultural Products and Raw Materials" was adopted. This was the main legislative act in the field of organic market regulation until 2018.

Already on 10 July 2018, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law of Ukraine “On Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products” No. 2496, and on 2 August 2019 it was enacted.

In May 2023, the National Accreditation Agency of Ukraine issued the first accreditation certificate to Organic Standard LLC. In June 2023, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy included Organic Standard LLC in the State Register of Certification Bodies in the Field of Organic Production and Circulation of Organic Products, which allowed it to start certifying organic production and/or circulation of organic products in accordance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.

In August 2023, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy launched the Register of Operators that Produce Organic Products in Compliance with the Legislation in Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products.
