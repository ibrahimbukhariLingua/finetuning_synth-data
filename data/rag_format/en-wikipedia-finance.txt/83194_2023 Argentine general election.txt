General elections were held in Argentina on 22 October 2023 to elect the president, vice president, members of the National Congress, and the governors of most provinces. As no presidential candidate won a majority in the first round, a runoff was held on 19 November, in which Javier Milei defeated Sergio Massa to become President of Argentina. Incumbent president Alberto Fernández and incumbent vice president and former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, despite both being eligible for a second, consecutive term, did not seek re-election.

Advancing to the runoff, Massa of the ruling centre-left Union for the Homeland unexpectedly came in first place, winning 36% of the vote, against Milei of the right-wing Liberty Advances, who came in second place, with 30% of the vote. Massa's victory in the first round was seen as an upset because of the severe inflation that took place during Massa's tenure as economy minister, as well as Milei's lead in polls up to that point. In the runoff Milei defeated Massa with 56% of the vote, the highest percentage of the vote since Argentina's transition to democracy. Milei received over 14 million votes, which was the highest ever vote total in Argentina's history. In a surprise reversal of the first round, Milei outperformed polls, which had been predicting a much closer race. Massa conceded defeat shortly before the official results were published. Milei was inaugurated on 10 December.

Observers generally saw Milei's win as a sign more of discontent with the *status quo* than support for his politics, and his victory was likened to that of Donald Trump's 2016 victory in the United States and Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 victory in Brazil. Milei expressed support and admiration for both figures and endorsed Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election.


## Background

In the 2019 general election, the Peronist, left-wing Frente de Todos ticket of Alberto Fernández, former Cabinet Chief, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, National Senator and former president, defeated the center-right Juntos por el Cambio ticket of incumbent president Mauricio Macri and conservative Peronist National Senator Miguel Ángel Pichetto, exceeding the threshold to win the presidency in a single round. Macri became the first incumbent president in Argentine history to be defeated for reelection.

The first two years of the Fernández presidency were limited by the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina, during which he imposed strict lockdown measures in an attempt to suppress the spread of the disease, and a debt crisis. While the economy did recover in 2021–22, inflation rose to 100% (the highest since 1991). His approval ratings have been consistently low throughout his presidency, only on a few occasions has his approval rating been over 50%, with disapproval ratings from 60% to 80%. According to British newspaper *The Economist*, Fernández is "a president without a plan", and his presidency is a "weak administration", alluding to his lack of independent decision-making and under the heavy influence of Vice President and former President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, also the leader of the coalition, whom Fernández himself described as a "permanent source of consultation." The 2021 midterm elections resulted in heavy losses for the Frente de Todos, which lost its majority in both houses of Congress. Observers attributed the loss to widespread anger over high inflation and rising poverty.

In April 2023, Fernández announced that he had decided not to seek reelection to the presidency in the 2023 general election. Others who refused to run were incumbent vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (who served as president between 2007 and 2015), and former president Mauricio Macri, who succeeded Fernández de Kirchner and preceded Fernández. Controversial constitutional amendments in Jujuy – a province governed by Gerardo Morales, who ran as a precandidate for vice president alongside Horacio Rodriguez Larreta– led to protests beginning in June where demonstrators stormed the Jujuy legislature.

The 2023 election was held amid a severe economic crisis with over 140% inflation and 40% poverty which observers said would negatively affect the ruling party's chance for another term.

## Electoral system


### President

The election of the president is conducted under the ballotage system, a modified version of the two-round system. A candidate can win the presidency in a single round by either winning over 45% of the vote or if they win 40% of the vote while finishing more than 10 percentage points ahead of the second-place candidate. If no candidate meets either threshold, a runoff takes place between the top two candidates. Voting is compulsory for citizens between 18 and 70 years old. Suffrage is also extended to 16- and 17-year-olds, though without compulsory voting. Both in the primaries and in the first and second rounds polls opened at 08:00 and closed at 18:00 (UTC −3), with vote results starting to show at around 21:00.


### Congress


#### Chamber of Deputies

The 257 members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected by proportional representation in 24 multi-member constituencies based on the provinces (plus the City of Buenos Aires). Seats are allocated using the d'Hondt method with a 3% electoral threshold. In this election, 130 of the 257 seats were up for renewal for a four-year term.

## Reactions


### Domestic

Milei defeated Massa in the runoff what was described as a historic election in Argentina. Milei in his victory speech vowed to begin "the reconstruction of Argentina" and end the country's economic decline. His prospective foreign minister Diana Mondino also announced Argentina would pause their accession to BRICS. Massa conceded and announced his retirement from politics after the runoff election results showed that he had lost by roughly 11 percentage points.

Incumbent and retiring president Alberto Fernández congratulated Milei: "I am a man of democracy, and I value nothing more than the popular verdict. I trust that tomorrow we can start working with Javier Milei to guarantee an orderly transition." Former president Mauricio Macri, who had endorsed Milei in the runoff, said: "I congratulate Javier Milei for bravely representing the will to advance and prosper that lives in the hearts of Argentines. He knew how to listen to the voice of young people and the fatigue of millions of neglected and impoverished people."


### International

 Bolivia: Bolivian president Luis Arce wished success to Javier Milei and said that he would work hard to keep "firm relations" with Argentina. On the other hand, former president Evo Morales said that he would never wish success to "[Milei's] fascism, far-right and neoliberalism, who supports the Zionist genocide and Yankee imperialism."

 Brazil: Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva congratulated Milei without mentioning his name, saying: "Democracy is the voice of the people, and it must always be respected. My congratulations to Argentine institutions for conducting the electoral process and to the Argentine people who participated on election day in an orderly and peaceful manner. I wish the new government good luck and success." Former president Jair Bolsonaro congratulated Milei saying: "Congratulations to the Argentine people for Javier Milei's victory. Hope will shine again in South America. May these good winds reach the United States and Brazil so that honesty, progress and freedom come back to all of us."

 Chile: Chilean president Gabriel Boric congratulated Milei saying: "I salute Javier Milei for his victory and Sergio Massa for his worthy recognition of defeat. I wish the Argentine people the best and know that they will always have our respect and support. As president of Chile, I will work tirelessly to keep our sister nations united and collaborating for the well-being of all."

 China: Chinese president Xi Jinping congratulated Milei saying: "I am ready to work with President-elect Milei to continue the China-Argentina friendship, help the development and revitalisation of our respective countries through win-win cooperation, and promote steady and far-reaching development of China-Argentina relations." Milei thanked Xi for his congratulations, replying "I thank President Xi Jinping for the congratulations and good wishes. I send him my most sincere wishes for the Chinese people's wellbeing."

Wishing him the greatest success in his administration, Peru renews its commitment to continue strengthening the historic ties of friendship and cooperation that unite our countries."

 Russia: Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Milei, despite the latter support for Ukraine in the Russo-Ukrainian War. Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said: "We noted a number of statements that Mr. Milei made during the election campaign, but we will focus on and judge him mainly by the statements that he makes after the inauguration" while remaining supportive of the "development of bilateral relations with Argentina."

 Ukraine: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy congratulated Milei on his victory and thanked him for his clear stance of support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy further stated that he looked forward to working together with Milei to strengthen Ukrainian-Argentinian cooperation and restore international order based on international law. Zelenskyy and Milei held a phone call where they discussed cultivating relations and Ukraine's war against Russia.

 United States: U.S president Joe Biden congratulated Milei and held a phone call with him, where Biden said that Argentina can count with US support. Milei told Biden that he would align with the US and Israel, while repeatedly saying that he would cool relations with China. Antony Blinken, the United States Secretary of State, congratulated Milei saying: "The United States congratulates Argentine President-elect Javier Milei on his victory in today's election, and we applaud the robust democratic process through which the Argentine public has spoken. The strong turnout and peaceful conduct of the vote are a testament to Argentina's electoral and democratic institutions. We look forward to working with President-elect Milei and his government on shared priorities that benefit the people of both countries, including protecting human rights and democracy, addressing climate change, and investing in the middle class." Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, congratulated Milei saying: "I congratulate Javier Milei on his election as president of Argentina and to the people of Argentina for holding free and fair elections. We look forward to building on our strong bilateral relationship based on our shared commitment to human rights, democratic values, and transparency."

 Venezuela: Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, reacting to the election results, declared that "the neo-Nazi extreme right won in Argentina, we call for reflection on the emergence of extreme right centers that seek to impose themselves to recolonize Latin America and impose extremist models".
