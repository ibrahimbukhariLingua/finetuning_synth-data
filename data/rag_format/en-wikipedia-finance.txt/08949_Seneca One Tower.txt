Seneca One Tower


# Seneca One Tower



**Seneca One Tower** is a 529-foot (161 m) skyscraper located in downtown Buffalo, New York. The building was formerly known as **One HSBC Center** (1999–2013) and prior to that, as **Marine Midland Center** (1972–1999), its name was changed in 1999 shortly after Marine Midland's parent company HSBC re-branded the bank as HSBC Bank USA. The building was constructed at a cost of $50 million between 1969 and 1974, and contains over 1,200,000 square feet (110,000 m²) of space. Today, the 40 story building still dominates the Buffalo skyline. It is an example of modern architecture. The building's design is similar to that of the 33 South Sixth building in Minneapolis, which was designed by the same architectural firm.

In 2021, the entire tower and four mezzanine floors were finished being renovated as part of a $150 million renovation by Douglas Development, which included adding over 200 prime rate apartments.

## History

On December 5, 2012, HSBC Bank USA announced that they would vacate the space it leased in the tower by the time their lease expires in October 2013. Paired with the departure of Phillips Lytle LLP, and the recent closing of the Canadian Consulate, the tower was 90 percent vacant as of 2014. In August 2016, it was announced that Washington, D.C.–based Douglas Development will buy One Seneca tower. On September 29, 2016, Buffalo Business First reported that Douglas Jemal of Washington, D.C. had completed the purchase of One Seneca Tower and an adjacent parking ramp with plans to redevelop the tower and plaza into a mixed-use complex including retail, restaurant, hotel, office and apartment components.

In June 2019, M&T Bank announced it would occupy 15 of the tower's floors as the bank's "technology hub." In 2020, the building gained a paint scheme of terra cotta and gunmetal. In early 2021 an illuminated M&T Bank sign was added to the top of the building, replacing a Buffalo Bills pennant (a promotional courtesy of the local Oxford Pennant Company) that was temporarily introduced for the team's 2020 season playoff run between the AFC Wild Card and AFC Championship rounds.
