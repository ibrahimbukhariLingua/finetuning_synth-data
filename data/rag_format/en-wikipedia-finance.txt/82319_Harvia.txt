## History


### The era of Tapani Harvia (1950–1989)

In 1950, Tapani Harvia founded the Art Workshop Harvia (named Taidetakomo Harvia) in Jyväskylä, located on the ground floor of his private residence. The company manufactured decorative items, including hearth doors.

Tapani Harvia made the first Harvia woodburning stove for his own use in 1950. The first woodburning stove for sale was completed in the mid-1950s. By the end of the decade sauna heaters had become Harvia's main product with about 500 sold annually. In 1958 the company was renamed Takomo T Harvia Ky and in 1961 it was renamed Harvia Ky.

In the early 1960s, the production of continuously heated heaters began. By the decade's end, Harvia manufactured about a thousand heaters a year.

Harvia moved from Jyväskylä to Muurame in 1972 to its own industrial hall. Harvia's adult kids joined the company in the mid-1970s. Risto Harvia started as CEO in 1977.

Harvia Ky changed from being a limited liability company to Harvia Oy in 1980. Tapani Harvia retired and served as chairman of the board. In addition to wood-burning stoves, Harvia began manufacturing electric stoves in the early 1980s. In the end of the decade the company manufactured approximately 20,000 wood-fired and 5,000 electric heaters per year.


### International growth (1990–2013)

Growth continued in the 1990s, when the company started exporting to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia and the United States.

At the turn of the millennium, Harvia produced around 100 000 heaters a year, half of which were exported. The company's subsidiary made ready-made heaters for export. The company had a turnover of 135 million markkas and 120 employees.

In 2005, Harvia established a factory in China.

In 2011, the company had a turnover of 65 million euros.

In 2013, Harvia had around 300 employees, with 200 based in Muurame and the rest in China and Hong Kong. Exports accounted for 60 percent of turnover. Risto Harvia retired at the end of the year but continued to serve on the company's board.


### Owned by CapMan (2014–2017)

In spring 2014, the Harvia siblings sold 80 percentage of their family business to the investment fund CapMan. Pertti Harvia continued as CEO, while the other three siblings retired. They justified the transaction on the grounds of Finnish tax: the tax on the generational transfer would have been too expensive for them. Both Harvia and CapMan aimed to list Harvia on the stock exchange in a few years.

For the local market in Russia, a wood-burning stove factory was established in 2015.

Pertti Harvia retired and his successor Tapio Pajuharju took over in June 2016. Pajuharju, who had been CEO of Hartwall, had been on Harvia's board since 2014. The company produced around 200 000 heaters a year, with hundreds of different models. Spa Moduls, a company bought from Estonia, produced steam rooms, known as Turkish saunas. In November, Sentiotec, a company producing products such as sauna rooms, infrared and steam saunas, digital control centres, sauna accessories and electric heaters, was acquired from Austria.
