Ministry of Finance (Malaysia)


# Ministry of Finance (Malaysia)



The **Ministry of Finance** (Malay: *Kementerian Kewangan*; Jawi: كمنترين كواڠن‎), abbreviated **MOF**, is a ministry of the Government of Malaysia that is charged with the responsibility for government expenditure and revenue raising. The ministry's role is to develop economic policy and prepare the Malaysian federal budget. The Ministry of Finance also oversees financial legislation and regulation. Each year in October, the Minister of Finance presents the Malaysian federal budget to the Parliament.

The Minister of Finance administers his functions through the Ministry of Finance and a range of other government agencies.

Its headquarters is in Ministry of Finance Complex, Putrajaya.


## Duties and importance

The Minister of Finance is the minister in charge of government revenue and expenditure. The Minister oversees economic policy: fiscal policy is within the Minister's direct responsibility, while monetary policy is implemented by the politically independent Central Bank of Malaysia, the head of which is appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Minister of Finance also oversees financial legislation and regulation. Each year in October, the Minister of Finance presents the Malaysian federal budget to the Parliament.

The Minister of Finance is a very senior government post; historically, many Ministers of Finance have previously, concurrently or subsequently served as prime minister or deputy prime minister. Service as Minister of Finance is seen as an important (though certainly not essential) qualification for serving as prime minister: to date, five Ministers of Finance have gone on to be prime minister.
