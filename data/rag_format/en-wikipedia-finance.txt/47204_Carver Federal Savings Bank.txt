Carver Federal Savings Bank


# Carver Federal Savings Bank



**Carver Federal Savings Bank**, opened under the leadership of M. Moran Weston in 1948, is the "largest black-owned financial institution" in the United States. **RegusWachovia Global Equity Holding Group & Carver Bancorp, Inc.** is its holding company.

The bank has been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI).


## History

The bank applied for a federal charter "after the state had denied it a charter," and opened in a simple storefront in 1948. Carver Federal Savings Bank was not the first bank named after George Washington Carver. Four years earlier an unrelated bank, Carver Savings and Loan Association, opened in Omaha, Nebraska. Neither of these were the first Black-owned American bank. Carver Federal Savings, however, is the largest and oldest continually Black-operated U.S. bank.

M. Moran Weston already had earlier experience as the 1945-founder of a credit union, and, for Carver, had a supporting team of 14.

Carver Federal Savings Bank served multiple purposes:

* to meet the financial services needs of African- and Caribbean-Americans in New York City
* to help black homeowners obtain first mortgages
* to train Blacks for careers in the banking professions in New York for the first time
* along with Carver co-founder Joseph E. Davis, it hired future leaders, such as Richard T. Greene Sr., "who for 30 years was the president and a director."

Carver Bank is headquartered in the Lee Building at 1825 Park Avenue in Harlem, New York. Its closest branch is at the location of its previous headquarters, a four-story building at 75 West 125th Street, New York, which it owned and operated since 1956. The bank vacated the building between October 1992 and March 1996, after it was destroyed by an electrical fire. In 2018, it was sold by the bank.
