## Projects

Capital Impact provides financing to individuals, organizations and companies in order to build new businesses or expand existing facilities that increase access to services for populations made up primarily of low to moderate income residents.


### Cooperative development

With its origins in the 1978 National Consumer Cooperative Bank Act, Capital Impact continues with the economic advancement of cooperatives as one of its initiatives. They partner with the National Cooperative Grocers Association to provide underwriting and loan administration services to food co-ops across the country. In 2015, Capital Impact awarded $40,000 to the Democracy at Work Institute and the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives through its first Co-op Innovation Award.

In 2011, Capital Impact received a $2 million grant from the Social Innovation Fund, a program of the Corporation for National and Community Service. Capital Impact used the grant to replicate shared equity homeownership programs that enable new homebuyers to partner with a government or nonprofit agency acting as a co-investor, providing the homebuyer with public funds to reduce costs. In return, homebuyers agree to share their equity appreciation to preserve affordability and return funds to the initial public investment. In October 2015, a piece in the *Dallas Observer* featured Capital Impact's "Inclusionary Calculator" to help cities address affordable housing zoning issues. In 2016, Capital Impact was awarded $4.8 million from the Community Development Financial Institution Fund's Capital Magnet Fund, which is given to aid low-income families and economically distressed communities.

### Senior care

In 2006, Capital Impact received a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to help create the Green House Project, an alternative to the traditional nursing home. Capital Impact managed the initiative until it became an independent organization in 2016. Developed by Dr. Bill Thomas, Green House homes provides nursing care to 10 to 12 older adults in a small, home-like setting with the goal of providing more autonomy in decision-making, more self-directed care and more social connections. As of 2015, there are 153 Green House homes on 35 campuses in 25 states across the country including The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Green House Homes at Mirasol in Loveland, Colorado.

Capital Impact also administered the Village to Village Network, a peer network group that facilitates older adults aging in place based on a model started by Beacon Hill Village, until it became an independent organization in 2015. Villages are community-based membership organizations that provide support through volunteering and resource referrals for older adults so they can age in their own homes and communities.

In 2015, Capital Impact partnered with the AARP Foundation and the Calvert Foundation to establish the Age Strong impact investing program to help older adults remain in their communities as they age. The Age Strong effort identifies and provides financing to projects that help low-income people over 50 secure housing, have access to healthy food and health care, improve their financial situations and remedy common problems associated with isolation. In August 2016, it was announced that Capital Impact gave $3 million in funding from the Age Strong fund toward Keystone Healthcare Development Service's Federally Qualified Health Center in Transfer, Pennsylvania operated by Primary Health Network.

In September 2016, Capital Impact Partners loaned funding to the Mustard Seed Project of Key Peninsula in order to purchase a former restaurant and five acres surrounding it to house the first senior housing on the Key Peninsula. Capital Impact funded the senior housing community Magnolia Crossing in Clovis, California. The community was created to give residents care in a homelike environment with 14 units of the 48 unit community were set aside for seniors on Medi-Cal. It is the first project of its type to earn partial financing by the New Markets Tax Credit Program.
