## Research

Rogers studies how accounting information affects the efficiency of capital markets. For capital markets to provide the most benefit to society, they require timely and high-quality information flows that enable investors to identify the most promising investments. Inaccurate or low-quality information distorts investment decisions. Rogers studies this information flows, examining: a) strategic communication by firms and managers via voluntary disclosure, b) the role of media in affecting stock prices and in exacerbating or mitigating insider trading advantages in comparison with the average investor, and c) the employment market for ex-CEOs of publicly traded companies.
