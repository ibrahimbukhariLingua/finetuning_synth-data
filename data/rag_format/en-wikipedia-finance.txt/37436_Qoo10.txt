In April 2018, eBay completed acquisition of Giosis Private Limited and its Japan properties, including Qoo10.jpʲᵃ, which will operate independently from other Qoo10 sites. eBay relinquished its stakes in Giosis' non-Japanese businesses, which moved under newly established parent company, Qoo10 Pvt.

In February 2024, Qoo10 acquired Wish.com, an American e-commerce platform for approximately $173 million. At that time, the Qoo10.com site rebranded the logo from Qoo10 to Wish+. But the Tmon and WeMakePrice refund issue cause the name to be retracted to Qoo10.

In August 2024, Qoo10 reportedly cut over 80% of its workforce in Singapore. This restructuring followed reports of financial instability within Qoo10's South Korean operations, where the platform had allegedly defaulted on payments to local merchants and consumers in July 2024. The payment delays, aggravated by the retrenchments of account managers, prompted several merchants to file small claims and police reports. In September 2024, the Monetary Authority of Singapore ordered Qoo10 to suspend payment services in Singapore, due to excessive unfulfilled orders and payment obligations to merchants and customers. Qoo10 also ceased operations in Malaysia, shutting down its Malaysian platform, *Qoo10.my*, as part of its broader effort to consolidate resources amidst its financial difficulties. On 11 November 2024, Qoo10 was ordered to wind up in Singapore after the Singapore High Court found the company to be insolvent.
