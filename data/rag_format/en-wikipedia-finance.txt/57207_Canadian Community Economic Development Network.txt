Canadian Community Economic Development Network


# Canadian Community Economic Development Network



The **Canadian Community Economic Development Network** (CCEDNet) is a member-driven Canadian organization, founded in 1999 to increase the scale and effectiveness of community economic development (CED), helping organizations and individuals strengthen their communities and create solutions to local needs. CCEDNet was created to strengthen community economic development in urban, rural, northern, and Aboriginal communities across Canada in order to contribute to a better social, economic, and environmental conditions at the local level. CCEDNet's members are from community-based organizations, co-operatives, social enterprises, practitioners, active citizens, researchers, and other organizations from every region of Canada. Members are located in all provinces of Canada and two territories and are engaged in a range of activities focused on addressing the inequities born out of the mainstream economy, generally through working with those who have barriers to social and economic inclusion.

CCEDNet is currently a member of international networks such as the New Economy Coalition and the Intercontinental Network for the Promotion of Social Solidarity Economy (RIPESS)


## Community Economic Development Resources

CCEDNet operates as an information clearinghouse and has accumulated over 1300 resources directly related to Community Economic Development (CED) - websites, publications, research reports, case studies, videos, and more.


## National Projects

Since 2005 CCEDNet has administered a national internship program called ***Create*Action** placing over 200 youth into 6-month placements with CED organizations across Canada. This program has typically been funded by Employment and Social Development Canada. The program has been delivered 9 times, with last placements taking place in 2013/2014.

CCEDNet was the national community partner co-directing the **Canadian Social Economy Hub** (CSEHub) with the University of Victoria. The CSEHub was a national community-university research alliance funded through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and was part of the **Canadian Social Economy Research Partnerships** (CSERP). Between 2005 and 2011, the CSEHub acted as a facilitator promoting collaboration among the six regional research centers of CSERP across Canada (Qu√©bec, Atlantic, Southern Ontario, Prairies and Northern Ontario, BC and Alberta and the North), and creating opportunities and exchanges with international networks.

CCEDNet Manitoba manages the Enterprising Non-Profits (ENP) program in the province (ENP-MB). ENP-MB is one of seven ENP programs operating throughout Canada to support the social enterprise sector through matching grants, training, and resources.

CCEDNet Manitoba has played an active and key role in the development of provincial policies such as the Manitoba Social Enterprise Strategy.
