**PriceGrabber**.com is a price-comparison shopping site and distributed content commerce service founded in 1999 by former CEOs Kamran Pourzanjani and Tamim Mourad. The company partners with merchants, retailers, and sellers to provide information on a wide range of products. PriceGrabber.com was the first comparison-shopping engine to project tax and shipping cost information for a consumer during the price comparison process.
