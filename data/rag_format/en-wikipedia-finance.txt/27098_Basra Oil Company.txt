The BOC was classified as the first company in Iraq and the eighth in production rating for global oil companies. The company activities covered a geographical area of 180,000 m² stretching from the Persian Gulf to Hadeth. During the 1970s the maximum rate of production from the south field was 2.75 million barrels per day (437,000 m³/d) and the planned limit was 4 million barrels per day (640,000 m³/d).
