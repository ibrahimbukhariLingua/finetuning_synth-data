ADA provides "independent artist and label partners with access to the resources, relationships and experience required to share their creative vision with a global audience."


## History

As the independent music distribution arm of Warner Music Group, ADA Worldwide was created in 1993 as a joint-venture between WMG and Restless Records to offer a distribution system and marketing, merchandising, promotion, and music licensing services.

In January 2008, ADA acquired Insound, an online music retailer.

In 2012, Warner Music Group combined Independent Label Group with ADA to create a full-service company that provides services including physical and digital global distribution, physical production, merchandise production and distribution. ADA offers account management, an in-house music licensing function, custom products and services, marketing and sponsorships, as well as digital marketing tools.

In March 2017, ADA announced that it would distribute the catalogs of most of the labels owned by BMG Rights Management worldwide.

In January 2020, Beggars Group, Domino Recording Co., and Saddle Creek left ADA and switched to Redeye Distribution, and later in November, Entertainment One followed suit and had AMPED distribute most of eOne's labels. In October 2023, BMG moved its physical distribution to Universal Music Group, and started distributing their own catalog on digital platforms.
