## Functions

The WAA disposed of surplus consumer, capital, and producer goods; industrial and maritime real property; and airports and aircraft located in the United States and its territories. American factories had produced massive amounts of weaponry during World War II. Hundreds of thousands of tons of surplus military equipment, from mess kits to tanks, airplanes, machine guns, artillery, and even warships, were offered for sale as scrap by the WAA. Other items were sold for immediate use by consumers in their homes, vehicles, and businesses. In addition, government-owned industrial plants, airfields, and other real property was sold or turned over. Even patents, industrial processes, manufacturing techniques, and inventions were declared surplus and put up for sale.

Below are a few examples of surplus assets distributed by the WAA:

* Agricultural machinery
* Aircraft, built for military transport, purchased by airline carriers for commercial use
* Artillery factory, then converted by the new owners to produce electrical cords
* Books
* Coal
* Fabric
* Factories built for war-time production, purchased by their lessees to continue production for civilian trade
* Gliders
* Gulfport Army Airfield was converted to commercial use, and is now the Gulfport–Biloxi International Airport
* Hospital on a closed Army base became Alaska's first dedicated tuberculosis sanitorium
* Mules and horses
* Power station, to be operated as a public utility
* Snow chains for trucks and passenger cars
* Trucks
* Waste containers

## Successor

The WAA was abolished by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (63 Stat. 738), June 30, 1949. It was succeeded by the General Services Administration, as liquidator.
