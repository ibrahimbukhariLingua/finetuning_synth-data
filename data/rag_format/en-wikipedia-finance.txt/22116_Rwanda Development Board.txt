## Visit Rwanda sponsorship

In May 2018, Arsenal announced Visit Rwanda as the club's first official shirt sleeve sponsor and the club's official tourism partner in a three-year £10 million per year deal. The deal was extended to another four years in 2021.

In December 2019, Paris Saint-Germain signed a three-year €8-10 million per year deal with Visit Rwanda as the club's official tourism partner. The Visit Rwanda logo will also appear on the back of the men's training kit and on the shirt sleeve of the women's team's kit. In May 2023, the deal was extended to 2025.

In May 2021, the Basketball Africa League (BAL) signed a sponsorship deal with Visit Rwanda as a founding and host partner of the BAL. Visit Rwanda will be showcased on BAL team uniforms. The deal was extended to another five years in 2023.

In August 2023, Bayern Munich signed a five year partnership deal with Visit Rwanda as a football development and tourism promotion partner.

The Visit Rwanda initiative has had a very positive effect on Rwanda’s economy. By partnering with big sports teams like Arsenal, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, the country has become more popular around the world. This has helped attract more tourists, leading to more money being made from tourism about $498 million in 2019, contributing 13% to Rwanda’s economy. It also created many new jobs and encouraged foreign businesses to invest in the country. These deals promote eco-tourism, business travel and job creation, helping Rwanda grow even more.

The sponsorship deals have been met with criticism due to allegations of human rights abuse, with claims that Rwandan president Paul Kagame is using sportswashing to enhance the country's reputation.
