## History

In 1752, Benjamin Franklin founded the first American insurance company as Philadelphia Contributionship. In 1820, there were 17 stock life insurance companies in the state of New York, many of which would subsequently fail. Between 1870 and 1872, 33 US life insurance companies failed, in part fueled by bad practices and incidents such as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. 3,800 property-liability and 2,270 life insurance companies were operating in the United States by 1989.
