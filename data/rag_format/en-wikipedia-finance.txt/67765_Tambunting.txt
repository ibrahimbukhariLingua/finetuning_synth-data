## History

Tambunting Pawnshop was established by Don Ildefonso Tan Bunting in 1906.

After years of continuous expansion in his business, Don Ildefonso Tan Bunting tried the shipping business, and later started up the original pawnshop in the town of Santa Cruz, Manila with the name "Casa Agencia de Empe√±os de Ildefonso Tam Bunting".

By the time of World War II, his pawnshop had expanded to different locations inside and outside Metro Manila. By the 1990s, the newer generation of the Tambunting family already operated more than 300 branches nationwide. As of this year, Tambunting Pawnshop already has more than 1000 branches nationwide and is still expanding.
