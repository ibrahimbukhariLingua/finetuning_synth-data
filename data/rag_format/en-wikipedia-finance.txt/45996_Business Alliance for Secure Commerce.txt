Business Alliance for Secure Commerce


# Business Alliance for Secure Commerce



The **Business Alliance for Secure Commerce** (**BASC**) is an international business alliance, created to promote secure international trade in cooperation with governments and international organizations. The current director of BASC is Ferm√≠n Cuza.


## History

BASC, which initially stood for **Business Anti Smuggling Coalition**, was created by Mr. Fermin Cuza in 1996, as a voluntary cooperation program between the private sector and the United States Customs Administration, in order to avoid using legal trade for smuggling and drug trafficking.

That same year a company based in Cartagena was the first one in South America to adopt the BASC program and was chosen by the US Customs to develop the BASC pilot plan.

The **World BASC Organization** -WBO-was created in 2002 in the U.S. state of Delaware, as a nonprofit organization, to facilitate and speed up international trade, by establishing global security standards and procedures to the logistic trade chain with the support of custom entities and government authorities.
