American Antitrust Institute


# American Antitrust Institute



The **American Antitrust Institute** (**AAI**) is a Washington, D.C.–based non-profit education, research, and advocacy organization. The AAI advocates for more aggressive antitrust enforcement by the federal government.


## History and funding

Founded in April 1998, AAI is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt Washington, D.C., corporation. The AAI is funded through contributions from a wide variety of law firms, economics consulting firms, corporations, trade associations, and individuals, with substantial support from cy-près grants approved by courts in antitrust cases. According to *The New York Times*, the organization "has received funding from some tech companies."


## Activities

The AAI is known for calling on the federal government to investigate or block mergers that the Institute deems as anticompetitive and harmful to consumers. The AAI's policy approach has been described as one that "favors strong enforcement of the traditional approach to antitrust", in contrast to tendencies such as the New Brandeis movement.

In 2016, the AAI presented an updated statement of its position to the Trump administration titled AAI Transition Report to the 45th President of the United States.


## Leadership

The President of the AAI is Diana Moss. Governance rests in a nine-person Board of Directors. The AAI has more than 100 individual members of an Advisory Board including many international advisors.
