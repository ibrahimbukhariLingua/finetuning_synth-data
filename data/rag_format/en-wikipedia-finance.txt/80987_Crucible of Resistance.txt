## Synopsis

*Crucible of Resistance* seeks to challenge the mainstream accounts of the Greek government-debt crisis within the context of the Eurozone debt crisis. In the book, the authors argue that the assertion Greece is exceptional is a myth. They also argue that the causes of the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 lie in the key features of the neoliberal economic order. Finally, they assert that a progressive exit from the crisis would be to confront the limitations of the neoliberal order.
