## Fake coin rumour

In July 2016, some shopkeepers in India were reported to be refusing to accept the ₹10 coin entirely, the result of a rumour circulating on social media. It was initially claimed that coins with a 15 notch reverse design lacking the '₹' symbol were fake, compared to the 10 notch version using the symbol introduced in 2011.

It was later clarified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that the alleged "fake coin" was the earlier 2008 design, which predated the adoption of the '₹' symbol in 2010, and was still in legal circulation, along with the 2011 design and those refusing to accept it could face legal action.

In February 2018, the Reserve Bank of India began an awareness campaign of sending SMS text messages about the ₹10 coins with 10 and 15 radiating lines. Both are valid.
