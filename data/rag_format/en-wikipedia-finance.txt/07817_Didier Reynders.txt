## Political career


### Minister of Finance (1999–2011)

Reynders served as Minister of Finance from 1999 to 2011; in 2002, he chaired the G-10 which is the meeting of the main creditor states (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States).

In 2004 Reynders became Deputy Prime Minister in the government of Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. He was the chairman of the Mouvement Réformateur from 2004 to 2011.

Didier Reynders led the MR to a victory in the 2007 general elections when the MR became the largest Francophone party of Belgium. The King appointed Reynders as informateur, i.e. to start off the informal coalition talks for a new federal government.

Stalemate followed the 2010 general election. The King appointed a succession of people to negotiate a coalition from June 2010 onwards, but none succeeded in the task of forming a new government during the following seven months. Reynders was appointed informateur by the King on 2 February 2011. He reported on 16 February 2011, and his brief was extended through 1 March 2011.


### Minister of Foreign Affairs (2011–2019)

Following the appointment of Elio Di Rupo as new Belgian Prime Minister in December 2011, Reynders became Minister of Foreign Affairs. During his tenure, Belgium was elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (2019–2020), as well as of the United Nations Human Rights Council (2016–2018).


### Minister of Defence (2018–2019)

After the ruling coalition collapsed in 2019, Reynders also held responsibility for the defense portfolio. Following an inconclusive election in May 2019, King Philippe asked Reynders and Johan Vande Lanotte to look into the conditions required for forming a coalition government.

In 2019, Reynders announced his candidacy to succeed Thorbjørn Jagland as Secretary General of the Council of Europe; the position instead went to Marija Pejčinović Burić.


### European Commissioner for Justice (2019–2024)

In the summer of 2019, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel put Reynders forward as the Belgian nominee for the incoming European Commission. President-elect Ursula von der Leyen nominated him for the Justice portfolio. Reynders' hearing at the European Parliament was held in September 2019 and his nomination was approved by a large majority. He took office on 1 December 2019.

In 2020, Reynders announced plans to develop a legislative proposal by 2021 requiring businesses to carry out due diligence in relation to the potential human rights and environmental impacts of their operations and supply chains.

A 2022 report stated that Reynders was one of at least five senior EU officials targeted by Israeli spyware in 2021.

In September 2023, Reynders was temporarily assigned by von der Leyen the European Commission's competition portfolio following outgoing European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager’s announcement that she was officially a candidate for the presidency of the European Investment Bank.

In January 2024, Reynders again became the Belgian government's candidate for the position as Secretary General of the Council of Europe, this time competing with Alain Berset and Indrek Saar. Berset won the vote by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 25 June 2024 with 114 votes to 46 votes for Reynders and 85 for Saar.

In September 2024, the Belgian Government appointed Hadja Lahbib to succeed Reynders as the Belgian Commissioner in the European Commission, formally ending Reynders's tenure in the Von der Leyen's Commission.

## Controversies


### Political activities

In 2015, Reynders drew criticism for having his face painted black during a traditional festival in Brussels.

In April 2017, Belgium voted in favour of the entry of Saudi Arabia, yet considered one of the most retrograde countries on the issue of women's rights, in the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This decision raised controversy and questions about the role of Reynders.


### Criminal investigation

In September 2019, Belgian police investigated allegations of corruption and money-laundering against Reynders, relating to the construction of the Belgian embassy building in Kinshasa, the lease of a federal police HQ and other matters. The investigation was dropped soon after. In December 2024, another investigation was opened into "possible money laundering practices" related to the Belgian national lottery [nl].
