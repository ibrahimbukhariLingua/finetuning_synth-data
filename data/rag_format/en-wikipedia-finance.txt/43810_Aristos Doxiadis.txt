## Life

Doxiadis grew up in Athens and studied social sciences and economics in Harvard and the University of London. He began his career with studies of public policy for the Greek government and international organizations, participated in pilot programs of the European Commission to combat poverty throughout Europe, and then ran a consulting firm.

He has worked for fifteen years as a private equity executive. He has developed deal structure instruments (i.e., shareholders’ agreements, capital structures, exit mechanisms and incentive schemes) to bring international private equity practices within the framework of Greek law and business culture, has sat on the boards of about fifteen companies (including a bank in Bulgaria), and has taken an active executive role in some of those; and has structured the first leveraged buy-out by Greek private equity.

His experience includes acquisitions and divestments (i.e., business analysis, valuation, negotiation, due diligence, financial engineering), governance (strategic direction at Board level, incentive schemes, reporting and monitoring systems, senior recruitment, stakeholder alignment), new business and start-ups (territorial expansion, related business units, pure start-ups, strategic acquisitions), operations (logistics, costing and MIS, key account development), and finally fund raising and fund structuring.

Recently he has started work on the institutional and cultural determinants of economic development in Greece. He spent four months at the Centre for Governance and Public Management, Warwick Business School, as visiting fellow, doing research on this subject. He has published several related articles in Greek magazines, and some of his work has been published in English and German. Since 2010, he has been writing articles about the crisis and the Greek economy institutions. The *Invisible Rift* is his first book.
