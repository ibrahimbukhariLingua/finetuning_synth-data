**Rogers Corporation** is a specialty engineered materials company headquartered in Chandler, Arizona.


## History

In 1832, the company was founded by Peter Rogers as Rogers Paper Manufacturing Company. Today, the company is composed of two business segments: Advanced Electronics Solutions and Elastomeric Material Solutions. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in April, 2000.

In 2004, Rogers started Rogers Technologies Suzhou Company Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary, located in Suzhou, China. Rogers opened its first Suzhou facility in 2002, adding manufacturing capability for their roller and high-frequency laminate products. A second manufacturing facility opened in 2003.

In 2011, Rogers purchased German based curamik® Electronics, a manufacturer of power electronic substrates.

In 2016, Rogers announced that it would move its headquarters from the village of Rogers in Killingly, Connecticut, to Chandler, Arizona.

In November 2021, DuPont announced that it intended to acquire Rogers in a deal valued at $5.2 billion. The deal has been approved by all the necessary regulators save for the People's Republic of China's State Administration for Market Regulation. Due to the long delay that Chinese authorities presented, DuPont terminated the acquisition of Rogers and agreed to pay a termination fee of $162.5 million USD.

As of 2023, Rogers has locations the United States, China, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.
