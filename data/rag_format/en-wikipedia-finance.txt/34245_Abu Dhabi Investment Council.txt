Abu Dhabi Investment Council


# Abu Dhabi Investment Council



The **Abu Dhabi Investment Council** (Arabic: مجلس أبوظبي للاستثمار; **ADIC** or the "Council") is one of the investment arms of the government of Abu Dhabi. It started operations in April 2007, as a spin-off of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). ADIC is responsible for investing the government's surplus, targeting positive capital returns through diversified asset classes and active investments. In March 2018, Abu Dhabi Executive Council issued a law reorganising ADIC under the ownership of Mubadala.

In March 2018, Abu Dhabi Executive Council issued a law reorganising ADIC under the ownership of Mubadala.
