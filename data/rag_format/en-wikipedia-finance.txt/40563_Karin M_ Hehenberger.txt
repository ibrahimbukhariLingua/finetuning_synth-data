## Early life and education

Hehenberger is originally from Sweden and played for the Swedish National tennis team. At the age of 16, she was playing tennis internationally when she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, ending her tennis career. Her experience with diabetes led her to pursue a career fighting autoimmune diseases. Hehenberger attended the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, where she earned her M.D. and Ph.D. in molecular medicine. She went on to a post-doctoral fellowship with the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School.

In 2009, she received a kidney transplant from her father, after her kidneys had less than 10 percent total capacity, and in 2010 she received a transplanted cadaver pancreas. The kidney surgery saved her from needing dialysis, while the pancreas surgery rendered her free of diabetes, no longer needing to inject insulin.
