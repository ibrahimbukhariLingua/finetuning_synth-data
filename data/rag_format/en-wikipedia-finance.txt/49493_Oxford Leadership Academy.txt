## Brian Bacon and IPC (1983 - 2005)

The founder of Oxford Leadership Academy (OLA) Brian Bacon first started working with leadership in 1983 when he formed the management consulting branch of the global advertising agency DDB Needham. Through a buy-out in 1990, the branch separated from DDB Needham and became International Pacific Consulting (IPC) which would later be renamed to Oxford Leadership Academy.

IPC worked with several big actors such as McDonald’s during the following years. Charlie Bell, who was the CEO of McDonald’s in 2003 contacted Bacon and his company due to a massive decline in stock market value, from 42 cents to 11 cents. Brian Bacon and his team worked with renewing the public image of McDonald’s and this led to a more focus on the environmental work of McDonald’s, as well as changes to the products and the supply chain. The McDonald’s stock started to recover and doubled in value over 6 months, although this success cannot be solely accredited to IPC.


## Oxford Leadership Academy (2005 - present)

IPC tied up with Oxford Research in 1996 which was the first step in the rebranding of the company. But it was first in 2005 when the company moved its headquarters to Oxford, England, that the company changed its name to Oxford Leadership Academy.

The company have served a wide array of large-scale corporations. In 2007 their client list included corporations such as Ford, Ericsson, Coca-Cola, BP, Horwath International, Barclays, Unilever, McDonald's, Sandvik, GE, Fortis, Pharmacia, SAAB, British Aerospace and Volvo.

In 2020 Brian Bacon stated on Linkedin that through their digital courses that Oxford Leadership Academy has been engaging with new clients such as Virgin Media, Sky, Adobe, HSBC, Imperial College, Maersk, Everest, Computacenter and JCET. He also stated that Oxford leadership had been forming partnerships with corporations such as ExoWorld, OpenExo, Dakia Digital, Mindset Practice, Aeyons, Harthill for LDF assessment and Cross Knowledge to grow the corporation digitally in 2021.
