### Media appearances and interviews

In October 2009, Matlack started the Good Men Book tour at Sing Sing prison. According to Matlack, "My book is about manhood and redemption. I have in my mind the image of Johnny Cash going into Fulsom Prison. Like his music, my book is about manhood, raw and unvarnished. So I need to find guys who understand what that is about. It's also about the possibility of redemption, about making mistakes, and about picking yourself up. I have no idea what I am going to say to these guys but I am going to try."

In December 2009, Matlack appeared on the *Tyra Banks Show* where he donated, on behalf of the Good Men Foundation, $5,000 to help cover Christmas expenses for a family who had just lost their husband and father.
