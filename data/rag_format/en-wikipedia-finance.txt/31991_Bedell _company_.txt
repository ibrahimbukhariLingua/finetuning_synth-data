## History

In 1939, Advocate George Bedell founded his practice at 21 Hill Street, Saint Helier, Jersey. He had previously been commissioned to introduce income tax to the island and was appointed the first controller of income tax for Jersey in 1928.

After moving back to England during World War II, he returned to Jersey and set up a partnership with lawyer Dick Cristin. Together they founded Bedell and Cristin in 1958. Dick Cristin helped pioneer the abolition of the statutory 5% cap on interest rates in 1962. In 1971 the company expanded into managing trusts and created a new division known as Bedell Trust.
