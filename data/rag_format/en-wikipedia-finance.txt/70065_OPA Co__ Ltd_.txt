# OPA Co., Ltd.



**OPA Co., Ltd.** (株式会社OPA, *Kabushiki-gaisha OPA*) is a Japanese clothing retail chain and a wholly owned subsidiary of Daiei. It operates clothing and fashion malls across Japan and recently opened a store in Shanghai.


## History

Daiei's subsidiary Agora Daiei Co., Ltd. opened the 'Oriental Park Avenue' store in September 1988 in front of the Sanyo Shinkansen Shin-Kobe Station. This store formed the root of OPA. Shin-Kobe Oriental Park Avenue was also converted to an OPA store after the current OPA group was created in 2002. Shin-Kobe Oriental Avenue and the current OPA are not related.

Until September 1999 up to 13 OPA stores were opened all over Japan.

In January 2007, OPA became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of retail giant Daiei through a merger with Jujiya Co., Ltd.

At the end of 2006, a transaction with the Tokyu Land corporation was made.
