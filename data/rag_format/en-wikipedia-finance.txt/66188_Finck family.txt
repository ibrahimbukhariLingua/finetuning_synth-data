Finck family


# Finck family



The **Finck family** is a German family and banking dynasty which became prominent in Germany and Europe during the 19th and 20th century. Members of the family were involved with various companies, as early as 1790, when Burckhard Finck founded *Finck & Schäfer* in Bad Vilbel, a wholesale and retailer for liquor, oil, soap and colonial goods.

The family became most notable through Wilhelm von Finck who was prominently associated with Merck, Finck & Co since 1870. He was also a co-founder of Allianz and Munich Re and was nobilitated in 1905 by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. Since then his family branch carries the nobiliary particle and is known as **von Finck**.
