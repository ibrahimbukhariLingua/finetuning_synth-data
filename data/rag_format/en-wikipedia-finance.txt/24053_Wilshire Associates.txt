## History

Wilshire was founded in 1972 by Dennis Tito, who was an early pioneer of applying computer-based technologies to investment applications. Since the early 1970s, the firm developed from a technology firm into an investment management operation. In 1974, the firm created its signature Wilshire 5000 Stock index, which is a widely used index of all stocks actively traded in the United States.

Wilshire established an early reputationᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ by creating the first asset/liability model for pension funds in the 1970s, ten years before actuarial and accounting firms began to adopt this technology. Wilshire was also among the first to produce investment management tools to create index funds, optimize portfolios, construct bond portfolios and measure performance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1981, Wilshire launched its investment consulting business to address the needs of the plan sponsor community providing support for the pensions' investment professionals. Also in the early 1980s, Wilshire began to develop its own investment products. In the late 1980s and early 90s, Wilshire began to expand its investment activities into private market investments creating a series of private equity and venture capital product offerings.

In 2003, Wilshire was targeted by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in connection to its trading practices as part of a wide ranging 2003 investigation of mutual funds.

In January 2021, Wilshire Associates was bought by CC Capital and Motive Partners.

In 2021, the *Financial Times* started publishing 10 Wilshire indexes for individual digital assets and three multi-asset indexes. The multi-asset indices were:

* a Top 5 Digital Assets Index made up of Solana (23%), Ethereum (20%), Cardano (20%), Polkadot (17%) and Bitcoin (17%), giving a sector coverage of 59.14%;
* Top 5 ex Bitcoin Digital Assets Index made up of Solana (22%), Ethereum (20%), Cardano (20%), Polkadot (19%) and Dogecoin (19%), giving a sector coverage of 21.34%;
