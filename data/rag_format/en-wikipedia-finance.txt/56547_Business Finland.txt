Business Finland


# Business Finland



**Business Finland** is a public organization under the Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy. It was established on 1 January 2018, with the goal of attracting trade, tourism, and foreign investment, and providing funds for innovation to Finland. And as such, Business Finland is also involved in funding Finnish space researches, under the *New Space Economy* program, as well as startup companies, under *Young Innovative Company funding* program among other projects. The organization is made up of two entities: **Innovation Business Finland** (a government agency) and **Business Finland Oy** (a government-owned corporation controlled by the agency).


## History

The predecessor of the agency was *Tekes – the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation* (Finnish: *Innovaatiorahoituskeskus Tekes*), while the predecessor of the corporation was Finpro Oy. Tekes was founded in 1983 through the President of Finland, Mauno Koivisto, who ratified the Act on the founding of Tekes. "Tekes" is derived from *Tekniikan edistämiskeskus* (Center for Advancement of Technology), also translated as *National Technology Agency* or *Technology Development Centre*. The centre was founded primarily in response to an economic recession during the 1970s. At its formation in 1983, it employed twenty people. It began researching energy technology in 1995.

In 2009, Tekes invested €579 million in 2,177 projects, of which €343 million was directed to the enterprise projects and €236 million to universities, polytechnics and public research institutes.

In 2018, the Sipilä government fused together Tekes and Finpro Oy, a government-owned corporation for the promotion of exports. The target was to streamline business services and make sure that the service chain is not broken when a company proceeds from R&D to export. The initiative also sought to gain business investors from abroad in addition to those at home.

## Operations

Business Finland functions as a funding agency for research and technology development. Receivers of the funding are universities, polytechnics, research institutes such as VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, the European Space Agency, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), large corporations, and public bodies. In enterprise projects, funding is given to transform research-stage ideas into viable businesses and may combine direct unconditional funding with guaranteed loans conditional on the success of the resulting business.


### At the Time of Merging

Finpro and Tekes merged into Business Finland on January 1, 2018. The staff more or less retained their roles within the newly formed organization, with restructuring only occurring towards the end of the summer. Pekka Soini, the then-Director General of Tekes, became Director of the newly formed organization. Business Finland also launched the website at www.businessfinland.fi on 8 January 2018 where its plans for the future were outlined.

Business Finland remained at the same Tekes and Finpro addresses both internationally and in Finland. At Helsinki it was located at Team Finland House at Porkkalankatu 1.


### Current Locations

The agency is based in Helsinki, and is represented in fourteen regional *Employment and Economic Development Centre*s (also known as the *TE-keskus*) throughout the country. The agency also has offices in Beijing, Brussels, Tokyo, Silicon Valley, Hong Kong, and the District of Columbia.
