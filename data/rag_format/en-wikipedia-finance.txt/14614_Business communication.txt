## Barriers to business communication

There are several barriers that a business might experience when communicating with business partners. Such barriers can prevent one from receiving or understanding messages others use to convey information, ideas, and thoughts.

**Language**

Language is an essential source for human communication because without it, it is not easy for people to communicate among each other. Individuals use language to convey their thoughts, feelings, opinions, information, and emotions to other people.

Language barriers can make communication between internal and external parties difficult with misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and mistrust. Forms of barriers can be cultural differences, psychological differences, and dialects and jargon.

**Intercultural communication and behaviors**

Intercultural communication is often used to describe a range of communicational issues that increase inside an organization of different variety of religious, social, ethnic, and educational backgrounds. Intercultural communication becomes more complicated because individuals interpret communication between colleagues based on past experiences and their cultural backgrounds. If two people of different cultural backgrounds interact, intercultural communication is most likely to take place.

Different cultures also have different behaviors on what they consider to be a polite behavior and negative behavior. An example to be set is, in certain cultures it is the right norm to bargain about prices while in other cultures it may seem rude.

**Environment**

Environment barriers in business communication become to be distractions, errors, faults, or anything outside the person you are communicating with. Among space, noise and climate, time becomes an environment barrier when an organization that expects quick results will not afford slack from their employees.
