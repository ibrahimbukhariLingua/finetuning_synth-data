Farquhar often carries the epithet of *accidental billionaire* after he and his business partner Mike Cannon-Brookes founded Atlassian with the aim to replicate the A$48,500 graduate starting salary typical at corporations without having to work for someone else. Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes were Australia’s first technology billionaires.

## Early life

Farquhar was born in December 1979 in Parramatta, near Sydney. He attended James Ruse Agricultural High School and Castle Hill Primary School and graduated from the University of New South Wales, with a Bachelor of Science (BIT).

Farquhar developed an early interest in computers and his dad purchased an old computer for him to play games on, however it couldn’t run Microsoft DOS, so Farquhar spent a year trying to get it to work.


## Career

In 2001, Mike Cannon-Brookes sent an email to his University of New South Wales classmates asking if any of them was interested in helping him launch a tech startup after graduation, and Farquhar was the only one who responded. They founded Atlassian in 2002. They bootstrapped the company for several years, financing the startup with a $10,000 credit card debt.

Their first major Atlassian product was Jira, an issue- and project-tracking software. They decided to forgo the expense of hiring sales people, and instead spent their time and money on building a good product and selling it at a more affordable price via the Atlassian website. As of 2016, the company still did not have a traditional sales force, investing instead in research and development.

In 2005, they opened an office in New York, where most of their clients were. Later in 2005 they moved the U.S. office to San Francisco, which had a much larger pool of relevant technical talent.

Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes were recognised for their achievements with Ernst & Young's 2006 Australian Entrepreneur of the Year.

Their first external funding for Atlassian was a $US60 million round from Accel in 2010.

In 2014, they redomiciled the company to the UK, in advance of an IPO.

On 10 December 2015, Atlassian made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ stock exchange, putting the market capitalization of Atlassian at $4.37 billion. The IPO made Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes Australia's first tech startup billionaires and household names in Australia.

In 2022, Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes redomiciled Atlassian to the United States.

On 26 April 2024, Farquhar announced that he would resign as joint CEO of Atlassian at the end of August to focus on family time, philanthropy, and furthering the global technology industry. He remains on the board and as a special adviser. As of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, he owns 20 percent of Atlassian.
