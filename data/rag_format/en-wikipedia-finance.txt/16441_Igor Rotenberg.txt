In 2015, OJCS TPS Real Estate (Russian: ОАО "ТПС недвижимость") is one of the largest commercial real estate developers in Russia that manages several shopping centers in Russia and Ukraine. It is 100% owned by TPS Real Estate Holding Ltd. It owns the Krasnodar Gallery (Russian: ТРЦ "Галерея Краснодар"), Sochi's Moremoll (Russian: ТРЦ "Моремолл"), and Kiev's Ocean Plaza (Russian: ТРЦ "Ocean Plaza"). It is building the Novosibirsk Gallery (Russian: ТРЦ "Галерея Новосибирск") and Moscow's Slavyansky Boulevard metro station and Polezhayevskaya metro station.

In 2016, Igor Rotenberg was at the center of a controversy surrounding Platon (Russian: ПЛАТОН), a company he half-owns, and alleged discrepancies in its contracts with the federal road agency, Rosavtodor. Operated by RT Invest, the Platon toll system electronically tracks and charges tolls to trucks over 12 tons on Russian Federal roads. With a 25% ownership by Rotenberg and using satellite tracking data, ScanEx (Russian: ООО "ГК Сканэкс"), a subsidiary of RT Invest, is developing an electronic map of the 50,000 km (31,000 mi) of Russian federal roads in order to track vehicles for payment to Platon. Approved on 29 September 2014 by Roman Starovoyt (Russian: Роман Старовойт), who is the head of Rosavtodor, and Alexander Sovetnikov (Russian: Александр Советников), who is the director of RT – Invest Transport Systems (RTITS) (Russian: "РТ-Инвест Транспортные системы"), Rotenberg, through his companies, is guaranteed to receive from the state budget a very large portion of the 10.6 billion rubles indexed to inflation each year without VAT (4.98 billion rubles paid semi-annually) from 15 November 2015, to 29 September 2027, which is paid to the Planton & RT Invest partnership. After this was revealed, a large strike across Russia by truck drivers occurred on Russian federal highways beginning November 2015. On 28 November 2015, Anton Nosik alleged that the state would be missing large sums of money from the Avtodor GC (Russian: ГК «Автодор») tolls between the 15th km (Businovskaya intersection on the Moscow Ring Road) to the 58th km (Solnechnogorsk) along M11, which had been applied as maintenance fees not only to truck drivers but to all drivers and were not to be paid until the M11 project was completed, but were being charged to all motorists beginning on 23 November 2015. He alleged that the missing money from the budgeted funds for the construction of the M11 as well as both the future moneys from Avtodor GC and the PLATON systems had been diverted to the Rotenburgs' pockets through real estate money laundering investments in Miami. Instead of the expected total revenues from Platon of 20 to 40 billion rubles, the actual revenues were 25% or less than those figures.

On 29 March 2018, Igor sold his 33.3% stake in TPS Real Estate Holdings for $1 billion to his sister Liliya Rotenberg (Russian: Лилия Аркадьевичнa Ротенберг born 17 April 1978).
