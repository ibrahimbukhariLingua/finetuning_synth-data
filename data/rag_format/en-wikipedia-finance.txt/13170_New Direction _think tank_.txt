## History

New Direction was established in 2010 and draws its inspiration from the 2009 Prague Declaration, from which the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR) and the European Conservatives and Reformists group (ECR) in the European Parliament were founded. As of October 2016, the AECR is known as the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE).

New Direction is affiliated to the European Young Conservatives (EYC) and the International Democratic Union (IDU).


## Role and Mission

* Advancing Conservatism and a Europe of nation states:

New Direction's vision for Europe is for the advancement of small government, private property, free enterprise, lower taxes, family values, individual freedom, strong defence, a Europe of sovereign states and a strong trans-Atlantic alliance.

* Leading the debate on European reform:

The mission of New Direction is to strengthen the movement for European reform, by leading the debate on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world. The think tank aims to shift the EU onto a different course – away from the current orthodoxy of 'ever closer union' and central bureaucratic governance onto a path that promotes the freedom, prosperity and security of EU nations and their citizens.

* Influencing key players:

New Direction's strategy is to promote its values and ideas by influencing key players; ministers and elected officials from across Europe and the world, government officials, public policy experts, academics, business leaders, and the media. New Direction works closely with those who share a commitment to its values and works around the world to promote its constituent principles and issues.

New direction regularly hosts high-profile speakers including leading politicians and policy experts for panel discussions, interviews, roundtables, seminars, conferences, and public events in Europe, America, Asia and Africa.

The New Direction Academy was established to train young academics in strategic leadership, research and effective communications.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
