## History

According to the archives of Barclays Bank Ghana, *Colonial Bank* opened shop in what was then known as the Gold Coast in 1917. In 1925, Anglo-Egyptian Bank, Colonial Bank and National Bank of South Africa were merged to form Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas). In 1975, the Government of Ghana acquired 40 percent shareholding in Barclays Bank of Ghana. That stake was returned in 2003. In 2013, the bank became a member of Barclays Africa Group, with Barclays Plc holding a controlling 62.3 percent majority ownership.


## Name change

In 2016, Barclays Bank Plc, which owned 62.3 percent of Barclays Africa Group (BAG), the then majority shareholder of Barclays Bank of Ghana Limited, decided to divest its majority shareholding in BAG, worth £3.5 billion at that time. In 2017 Barclays reduced its shareholding in BAG to 14.9 percent.

Following that, in 2018 BAG re-branded to Absa Group Limited.
Under the terms of that re-brand, Absa had until June 2020 to change the names of its subsidiaries in 12 African countries.

In Ghana, the re-brand concluded on 10 February 2020, when both the bank's legal and business names became Absa Bank Ghana Limited.
