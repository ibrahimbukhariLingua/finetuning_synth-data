The State of Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources


# The State of Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources



**The State of Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources**, also known as the **Nevada Division of Minerals**, is a Nevada state agency division that focuses on regulating geothermal drilling activities in Nevada, whether conducted in private or public lands. The division is currently headed by a chairman, and the position is currently occupied by Josh Nordquist. It is headquartered in Carson City and maintains an additional office in Las Vegas.


## History

The commission and division have been in existence since 1977, though the commission was originally called the Nevada Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. The division, however, was already known as the Division of Mineral Resource and functions as part of the Nevada State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. In 1983, however, the commission was replaced by the Oil, Gas, and Mining Board and remained this way until 1993, when the commission was replaced by the Commission on Mineral Resources. As it has been since 1977, the commission contains seven members, though the structure has changed over time.
