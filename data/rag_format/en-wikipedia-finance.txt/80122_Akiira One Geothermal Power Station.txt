Akiira One Geothermal Power Station


# Akiira One Geothermal Power Station



The **Akiira One Geothermal Power Station**, is a proposed 70 MW (94,000 hp) geothermal power plant in Kenya, the largest economy in the East African Community.


## Location

The facility is located in the Greater Olkaria Geothermal Area, about 12 kilometres (7.5 mi), by road, south of the existing Olkaria I Geothermal Power Station, and approximately 127 kilometres (79 mi), northwest of Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city.


## Overview

Centum Investments, a Kenyan investment company, in conjunction with three other non-Kenyan entities, jointly plan to construct the Akiira Geothermal Power Station at a projected cost of US$300 million, using Akiira Geothermal Limited, the special-purpose company they jointly own. The power station will be developed in phases, with the first 70 megawatts coming on-line by December 2018 and the next 70 megawatts added to the national grid at a later date. In August 2015, Akiira Geothermal Limited signed a power purchase agreement with Kenya Power and Lighting Company, at a cost of 9.23 US cents per kilowatt hour.


## Ownership

Akiira One Geothermal Power Station is owned by Akiira Geothermal Limited, a Kenyan limited liability company owned by Centum Investment Company Limited and three other non-Kenyan companies. The shareholding in Akiira Geothermal Limited is as depicted in the table below:
