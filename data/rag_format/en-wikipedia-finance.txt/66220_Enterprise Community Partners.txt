## History

In 1972, three members of the Church of the Saviour—Terry Flood, Barbara Moore and Carolyn Banker—wanted to create low-income housing in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of D.C. With no development, financial or construction experience, they put down a non-refundable deposit to purchase the Ritz and Mozart apartment buildings. Their commitment won over James Rouse, CEO of The Rouse Company and he helped them secure $625,000 to complete the transaction and $125,000 toward the cost of rehabilitation.

In 1981, the experience inspired Jim Rouse to found **Robin Hood Inc.** based in one of Rouse’s American City buildings in Columbia, Maryland. The company was renamed to Jubilee Housing to help with fundraising efforts. Jubilee Housing provided the launchpad for Jim and Patty Rouse to start the Enterprise Foundation in 1982. In 2005, it was renamed Enterprise Community Partners.

In 1984, Jim Rouse was soliciting business representing both Rouse Company as chief executive officer and Enterprise Development as president. The Rouse Company board of directors asked Jim Rouse to leave as CEO of the Rouse Company and his position in Enterprise Development which ended his involvement with the company he founded.
