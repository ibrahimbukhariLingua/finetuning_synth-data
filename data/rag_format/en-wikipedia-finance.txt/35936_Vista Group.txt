They are made up of eight businesses with more than 630 staff across offices in Auckland, Sydney, Los Angeles, London, Shanghai, Beijing, Mexico City, South Africa, the Netherlands and Romania. Its software is installed in cinemas in 116 countries. Vista Group is listed on both the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) and Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).


## Corporate History

Vista Entertainment Solutions (Vista Cinema), the original and cornerstone company of Vista Group, was formed in New Zealand in 1996. In 1997, Vista Cinema made its first overseas sales in Argentina and Fiji, at which point its software was adapted to handle multiple languages and accommodate the complex tax laws and film regulations of other countries. This flexibility allowed Vista Cinema to expand rapidly into the diverse cinema markets of Central and North America, Europe, and Asia.

Vista Cinema was initially formed via a joint venture development agreement between Village Force Cinemas Ltd (now Event Cinemas) and Madison Systems Ltd (now Fujitsu Ltd). Madison Systems was part owned and staffed by people who are still staff and now shareholders in Vista Group today. Vista Cinema management took a direct 50% ownership in 2003 and total control of the company in March 2010 - four years prior to the listing of Vista Group in August 2014.

Between 2009 and 2014, Vista acquired total or partial control of a number of companies specializing in technology solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for the wider film industry. This aligned with the diversification of the company to vertically integrate additional sector requirements such as film distribution management and marketing data analysis.

The 2014 public listing of Vista Group International by the management company that owned Vista Cinema and its acquired companies, saw a listing on the NZX and ASX via an initial public offering of $92.6m, of which $40.0m was new capital. Vista Group (VGL) commenced trading on the NZX Main Board on the 11th of August 2014, with a market capitalization of $191.6m NZD.

Since listing, Vista Group has continued to acquire stakes in a number of technology companies that provide business solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ to the film industry.

In August 2016, Vista Group completed a transaction with movie ticket booking platform Beijing Weiying Technology (WePiao), establishing Vista China (previously a 100%-owned subsidiary of Vista Group), as a joint venture company. This investment from WePiao, and the extended rights from Vista Group to enable the sale of existing software solutions (Vista Cinema, Veezi, Movio, Maccs and Numero), positions Vista China to increase its footprint in the rapidly-expanding China film market.

In August 2017, Vista Group acquired a 60 per cent controlling stake in its long-term Latin American business partner, Senda Dirección Tecnológica, SA de CV, which has been renamed Vista Latin America.

In April 2020, Vista Group partnered with ScreenPlus to launch Screenplus' VOD platform offering available to exhibitors in all major territories, including the US, Canada and UK.
