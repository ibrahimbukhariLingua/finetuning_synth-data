The Ministry of Economy was created by the resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus on March 14, 1994, on the basis of the State Committee of the Republic of Belarus for Economics and Planning of the former Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. On May 24, 1994, the Council of Ministers approved the regulation on the ministry, and on October 6, 1995, it also approved a new regulation. On July 2, 1997, the Council of Ministers adjusted the functions of the ministry, entrusting it with some tasks in the field of energy.

In 2021, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Belarusian economic bodies, the emblem and flag of the Ministry of Economy was established, with the corresponding decree on official heraldic symbols being signed by President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. A jubilee medal was also established.
