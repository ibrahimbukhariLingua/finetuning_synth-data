Commercial Banking Company of Sydney


# Commercial Banking Company of Sydney



The **Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited**, also known as the **CBC**, or **CBC Bank**, was a bank based in Sydney, Australia. It was established in 1834, and in 1982 merged with the National Bank of Australasia to form National Australia Bank.


## History

On 8 September 1834 the *Sydney Herald* carried a notice titled "The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney" proposing the establishment of a new bank. It began operations on 1 November 1834 and in 1848 was incorporated by an Act of the New South Wales Parliament. Sir Edward Knox was the first bank manager and later a director. Thomas Barker, a manufacturer, engineer, politician, landowner and philanthropist, was a notable director and chairman. William Rutledge (born 1806 - died 1876 Port Fairy, Victoria, Australia), merchant, banker and early settler, also became a director of the bank in 1839.

The CBC grew to service the expanding pastoral and farming industries of the then Colony of New South Wales.

It absorbed the Bank of Victoria in 1927.

In July 1982, CBC Bank helped to fund a tour of Bob Merritt's play *The Cake Man* to Denver, Colorado.

In 1982 the bank merged with the National Bank of Australasia to form National Australia Bank.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
