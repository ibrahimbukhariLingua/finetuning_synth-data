**Oddup** is a data-driven research platform that provides analytical information on startups, their trends, and both current and expected future valuations. It is self-styled as *The Startup Rating System* and the company states its vision is to disrupt equity research in private companies.


## History

Oddup was founded by James Giancotti and Jackie Lam and is headquartered in Hong Kong. Oddup has offices in the United States, India, Singapore and Australia. The team is composed of former venture capitalists, quantitative analysts, traders, investment bankers and research analysts from top global institutions. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Oddup score and ratings

The Oddup score is based on an algorithm that pulls together data from a number of components often used in the investment due diligence process: quality, growth, location, investor, market, regulations, valuations and investment returns. Users are able to compare the chosen companies against industry peers and conduct due diligence on market, competitive landscape and other factors. The content is further enriched by fundamental research on potential exits conducted by Oddup's team of analysts.

Oddup is based on the combination of analyst view points and the computed algorithm – then producing the Oddup Score.

The startup rating scores are then offered as views: Buy, Hold, Sell – as is often done in sell-side equity research – with expectation metrics and future valuations.


## Track record

Oddup analysts have in the past predicted WeLab to become the first unicorn (company with valuation of over US$1 billion) in Hong Kong, and this was proven when the Chinese P2P lending platform's US$160 million Series B funding announcement took place on January 21, 2016. Additionally, Oddup has set the record when Google acquired Pie – one of Oddup's Buy rated startups in Singapore – in February 2016.

On January 5, 2017, Malaysian-based mobile classifieds startup Duriana was acquired by Singapore's Carousell (company). Duriana was a Buy rated startup on Oddup in July 2016.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
