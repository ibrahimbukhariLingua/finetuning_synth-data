## Fines and lawsuits

In 2012 Loya was fined $300,000 for violating state insurance laws in Texas after insurance regulators determined the auto insurance company used false advertising, and did not follow the company's filed criteria for policy discounts to customers.

A proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed against Fred Loya Insurance Agency, and Loya Casualty Insurance Company. In this lawsuit, Plaintiffs contend that Loya did not comply with the requirements under California law for payment of wages. If successful, a class action allows former and current employees to receive back wages that are owed to them.
