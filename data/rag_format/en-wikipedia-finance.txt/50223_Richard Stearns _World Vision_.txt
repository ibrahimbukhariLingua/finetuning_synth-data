## Perspectives

Among Stearns’ greatest contributions are his urgent call to the church in America to respond to the global AIDS crisis in the early 2000s and the widespread influence of his first book, *The Hole in Our Gospel*, winner of the Evangelical Publisher’s Association 2010 Book of the Year award. Toward the end of his tenure, Stearns boldly called the church to engage in the global refugee crisis and to follow Jesus into the most difficult places in the world, helping alleviate human suffering and care for the world’s most vulnerable children.

In 2014, World Vision U.S. announced that it would hire Christians in same-sex marriages. Facing protests from donors and the larger evangelical community after the announcement, World Vision reversed the policy change two days later.
