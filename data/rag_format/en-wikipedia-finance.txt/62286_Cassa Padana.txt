## History

**Cassa Rurale ed Artigiana della Bassa Bresciana** was formed in the 1970s by the merger of **Cassa Rurale e Artigiana di Leno** (found 1893), Cassa Rurale e Artigiana di Gambara (found 1891), and Cassa Rurale e Artigiana di Seniga e Pescarolo (found 1897). In 1993, the bank changed its name to **Cassa Padana** after absorbing Cassa Rurale e Artigiana di Gussola. The bank absorbed "BCC Camuna" in 2010, "Banca Veneta 1896" and "BCC Valtrompia" in 2011.

In 2016, due to the banking reform of BCC banks (Law N°49/201), the bank planned to demutualize itself by forming a subsidiary, Cassa Padana S.p.A., leaving the co-operative society as a parent company only. However, in May 2017, the bank changed to join the Cassa Centrale Banca Banking Group.
