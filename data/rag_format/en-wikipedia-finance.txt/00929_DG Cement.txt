## History

DG Cement was established in 1986 by state-owned company, State Cement Corporation of Pakistan in Dera Ghazi Khan. The plant was supplied by Ube Industries of Japan.

In 1992, DG Cement was acquired for PKR 1,799 million ($73.5 million) by Saigol Group under the privatization scheme of the Government of Pakistan. Later, it was transferred to Nishat Group in a swap scheme in which Nishat Group acquired DG Cement and Saigol Group acquired Maple Leaf Cement from Nishat Group.

In 1994, DG Cement initiated a $170 million expansion project at its Dera Ghazi Khan plant in Punjab. The project was financed in part by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which approved a $10 million exposure for the facility in 1995. The project contract was awarded to FLSmidth and was denominated in Danish kroner.

In 2004, DG Cement commissioned its second plant in Khairpur, Chakwal at a cost of PKR 9 billion.

In 2015, DG Khan setup its third and one of the largest plant of Pakistan in Hub, Balochistan.
