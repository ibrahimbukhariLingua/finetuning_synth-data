## Minister of Economy in Greece

Papadimitriou had been co-author of a study of the economy of Greece, published in 2014, where the following "policy options" were suggested: A significant, external, financial assistance to Greece through Marshall Plan–type capital transfers from the European Union; a temporary suspension of interest payments on the public debt of Greece; the use of those financial resources toward increasing demand and employment; the introduction of a parallel financial system based on new government bonds, the so-named "Geuros"; and the adoption of an employer-of-last-resort (ELR) program financed through that parallel financial system. The authors argued that their proposal "seems to provide the best strategy for a recovery, having immediate effects on Greek living standards, while [also] containing the effects on [the Greek] foreign debt.
