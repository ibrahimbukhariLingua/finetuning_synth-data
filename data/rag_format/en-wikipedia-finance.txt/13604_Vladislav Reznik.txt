## The Spanish Case

In 2008 a case was filed by Spanish Interpol against a group of Russians, which included a civil servant Vladislav Reznik. The investigation had lasted almost 11 years, the suspects were accused of “money laundering”. The Investigation Department of the MOI refused to institute criminal proceedings because the financial documents presented by the accused were clean, and the transaction that prompted the filing of the case was completely legal.

On February 19, 2018, a trial took place in a Spanish court, where Reznik was acquitted of all charges.

In October 2018, the National Court of Spain dropped the charges against all the Russians, involved in the case, including the deputy of the State Duma, Chairman of the Committee on Finances Vladislav Reznik. The acquittal was based on the fact that the evidence presented by the investigators did not confirm the accusations thus making them unfounded. Tax returns and other documents, which were presented to the court by Vladislav Reznik’s defense, confirmed that all of the politician’s income was completely legal and transparent.
