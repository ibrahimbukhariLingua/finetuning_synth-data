## History

Digital Insight developed FinanceWorks in response to the growing demand for financial management software.

Later, Digital Insight began offering the software as a standalone product.

In 2000, Digital Insight was acquired by Intuit, a financial software company based in California. As part of the acquisition, Intuit integrated FinanceWorks into its suite of financial management tools, which also included TurboTax and QuickBooks.

In 2016, Intuit announced that it would be discontinuing FinanceWorks and would be focusing on its other financial management tools. The company encouraged users to switch to its other products, such as Mint and Quicken.

Critics noted that the software lacked some of the more advanced features of other financial management tools, such as investment analysis and tax planning. However, for many users, the software provided a convenient and effective way to manage their finances.

The software provided users with a comprehensive platform for managing their finances, including account aggregation, budgeting, spending tracking, investment monitoring, and bill payment.
