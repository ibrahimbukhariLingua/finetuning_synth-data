The **Energy Networks Association** (**ENA**) is the industry body funded by UK gas and electricity transmission and distribution licence holders. Its current Chief Executive is Lawrence Slade.


## History

ENA was formed in October 2003 from the dissolution of the Electricity Association into three separate industry bodies:

## Function

ENA's role is to provide a strategic focus for the energy networks sector by communicating key messages. All its work is underpinned by technical expertiseâ€”more than half the association's staff are specialist engineers. ENA's online catalogue contains hundreds of reference documents relating to cables, contactor gear, electrical and mechanical composites, overhead transmissions and distribution lines, switchgear, engineering recommendations and other information. The association also records faults, defects and safety information on behalf of the networks industry.
