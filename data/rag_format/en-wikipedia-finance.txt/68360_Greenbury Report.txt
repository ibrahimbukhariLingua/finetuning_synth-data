Greenbury Report


# Greenbury Report



The **Greenbury Report** released in 1995 was the product of a committee established under the auspices of the United Kingdom Confederation of British Industry. The committee was formed at the behest of the President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, as a result of several scandals in the early 1990s. It followed in the tradition of the Cadbury Report and addressed a growing concern about the level of director remuneration. The modern result of the report is found in the UK Corporate Governance Code Archived 7 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine at section D.
