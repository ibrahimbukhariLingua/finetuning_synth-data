## Career

From 1968 to 1970, Rainwater worked for Goldman Sachs.

In 1970, Sid Bass, a classmate of Rainwater, invited him, then 26 years old, to manage the Bass family investments. From 1970 to July 1986, Rainwater served as the chief investment advisor to the Bass family. He was given $5 million to invest during his first year and managed to lose it all. Rainwater then sought a more methodical investment strategy by studying investors including Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, and David Dodd. Rainwater eventually transformed the Bass family fortune from $50 million into $5 billion, amassing $100 million for himself by the time he started investing his own capital in 1986.

In 1986, Rainwater joined forces with investor Sid Bass to form the investment firm Bass Brothers Enterprises. Together, they made a number of successful investments, including a stake in the Walt Disney Company.

Rainwater's investment success earned him a reputation as a savvy and successful investor, and he was often sought after for his expertise and advice. He was known for his ability to identify undervalued assets and create value through careful investment and strategic planning.

One of Rainwater's most successful investments was in the oil and gas industry. In the 1980s, he acquired a stake in the Bass family's oil and gas company, which he later sold for a significant profit. He also invested in a number of other energy companies, including Pennzoil and Diamond Offshore Drilling, and generated significant returns for his investors.

In addition to his investments in the oil and gas industry, Rainwater was also involved in real estate. He was instrumental in the development of the Las Colinas neighborhood in Irving, Texas, and helped to transform the area into a thriving business district. He was also involved in the development of other real estate projects, including the Harbor Pointe office complex in Dallas and the Lincoln Plaza.
