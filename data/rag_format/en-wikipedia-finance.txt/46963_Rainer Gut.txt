## Life

Rainer E. Gut was born on 24 September 1932, the son of Emil Gut, a bank director, and Rosa Gut née Müller. He attended schools in Zug, London, and Paris.

In 1968 he became a general partner at Lazard Frères & Co., New York and in 1971 president and CEO of Swiss American Corporation in New York, a U.S. investment banking subsidiary of the then SKA (Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, now Credit Suisse). In 1973 he was a member of the Executive Board and from 1977 he acted as spokesman for "Schweizerische Kreditanstalt" (SKA), of which he became chairman in 1982.

From 1983 to 2000 he was chairman of the Board of Directors of SKA and Credit Suisse respectively, and between 1986 and 2000 also chairman of the Board of Directors of Credit Suisse Group (formerly CS Holding). From 2000 to 2005, he served as chairman of Nestlé S.A.. He held directorships with several international corporations, including Alusuisse, Bayer, Swiss Re, Swissair, Daimler Chrysler Switzerland, Ciba Geigy/Novartis, Elektrowatt, and Sulzer. Gut was honorary chairman of Credit Suisse Group from 2000 until 2023.

Under Gut's leadership, SKA developed into a leading international financial services group with a focus on investment banking, asset management, and insurance. In the Holocaust debate of the 1990s about dormant assets, he was committed to the creation of a humanitarian fund by the Swiss business community. Thanks in large part to Gut, the settlement between the Swiss banks and the Jewish plaintiffs in New York was reached in 1998.

Gut was married to Josephine Lorenz in 1957 and had four children. He lived in Bassersdorf for several decades starting in 1973, and later in Maur. In 2019 his wealth was estimated at CHF 125 million by the business magazine Bilanz. He died on 11 October 2023, at the age of 91.
