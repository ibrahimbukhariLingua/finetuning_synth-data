## History

A first *Hofkammer* (court chamber) stewardship for the Austrian lands was established in Vienna by Archduke Ferdinand I, in order to balance the deficient Habsburg budget. Re-established by Maria Theresa in 1760, the chamber became the *k.k.* Finance Ministry of the Austrian Empire upon the Revolutions of 1848 and took its seat at the former city palace of Prince Eugene.

After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Austrian Finance Minister was only responsible for the Cisleithanian crown lands, while for the common financial policy of the real union, a separate Austro-Hungarian *k.u.k.* Finance Ministry was established. After World War I, the First Austrian Republic implemented a *Staatsamt für Finanzen*, which was renamed upon the adoption of the Austrian Constitution (B-VG) in 1920.
