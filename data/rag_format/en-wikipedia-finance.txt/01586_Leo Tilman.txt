# Leo Tilman



**Leo M. Tilman** (born 1971) is an American financier, author, and a leading authority on strategy, risk intelligence, and finance. He is a long-time advisor to companies, governments, and investors around the world. Tilman currently serves as Chairman & CEO of Agilion Systems, an advanced technology and strategic advisory firm. Before founding Agilion (formerly Tilman & Company), Tilman was an executive at BlackRock and Bear Stearns
and adjunct professor of finance at Columbia University.

Tilman is credited with predicting the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 by revealing unsustainable global imbalances in his book *Financial Darwinism*. His equally-prophetic 2019 book Agility: How to Navigate the Unknown and Seize Opportunity in a World of Disruption (2019), co-authored with former NORAD Commander General Charles H. Jacoby Jr., introduced a new theory of organizational agility. The book's call for action that leaders must learn how to navigate disruption and uncertainty—foreshadowed the subsequent global crises, including the COVID pandemic, corporate blowups, military conflicts, and social strife.

Tilman is the author of dozens of original works, including Risk Management (2000) co-authored with BlackRock’s co-founder Bennett Golub. In collaboration with Edmund Phelps, he co-authored a 2010 *Harvard Business Review* proposal to reignite U.S. economic dynamism by creating the *First National Bank of Innovation*. In a 2012 *European Financial Review* article, he redefined the concept of risk intelligence as an essential new competence for companies and investors.

Tilman was one of the main architects of a public/private partnership involving the White House Rural Council, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Farm Credit System that brought billions of private capital to innovative companies and projects.

He was profiled as a "Business Visionary" by *Forbes* among "influential authors, decision makers, and thought leaders in the field of business" and named Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum for "professional accomplishments, commitment to society and potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world."
