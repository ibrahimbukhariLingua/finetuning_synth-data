# Documentum



Documentum is an enterprise content management (ECM) software developed by OpenText. In December 2003, Dell EMC acquired Documentum for $1.7 billion, integrating it into EMC's Enterprise Content Division (ECD), one of its four operating divisions.

On January 23, 2017, OpenText, a Canadian technology firm specializing in ECM with its headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario, acquired Documentum from Dell EMC for $1.62 billion. The sources of funds included $650 million in cash, $585 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of OpenText's common shares, $254 million in net proceeds from the reopening of OpenText's 5.875% senior notes, and the remainder drawn from OpenText's existing revolving credit facility.


## Founding

Documentum was founded in June 1990 by Howard Shao and John Newton, who had previously worked together at Ingres. With initial funding from Xerox, Shao and Newton created a custom system for Boeing to manage information for the Boeing 777 training manuals. They also developed another system for Syntex, a pharmaceutical company, to automate the creation of New Drug Application (NDA) documents for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Documentum introduced its Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) in 1993, which was a client-server service for managing electronic documents. Users could connect to the repository via desktop client applications. EDMS also included a full-text search engine to retrieve documents from the repository.


## Company growth

In 1993, Jeffrey Miller, a Silicon Valley marketing executive, joined Documentum as president and CEO, with a mandate to transform the company from a technology-driven start-up to an established software firm. Under Miller's leadership, the company secured its first round of venture capital funding from Brentwood, Merrill Picker Anderson, Sequoia Capital, Norwest Corporation, and Xerox Ventures.

Documentum went public on NASDAQ on February 5, 1996, under the symbol DCTM.


## Web versions

In 1998, Documentum launched its Web Application Environment, a set of internet extensions for EDMS that enabled web access to documents stored within the EDMS repository. In 2000, Documentum released its first web-native platform, Documentum 4i, which could integrate with external web applications. In 2002, Documentum introduced Documentum 5, a unified ECM platform designed to store different types of content within a shared repository.


## Products


### Documentum Server

The Documentum Server, formerly known as Documentum Content Server, is the core platform used to manage content in a repository. This repository consists of three components: a content server, a relational database, and a storage location for files. Objects are stored in the repository, with associated files typically stored in a file system, and metadata stored as records in a relational database.


### Documentum clients

Formerly known as D2, Smart View is a configurable, content-centric client that provides access to ECM applications. It is the primary client for Documentum.
