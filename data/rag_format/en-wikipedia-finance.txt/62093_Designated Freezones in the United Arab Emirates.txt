Designated Freezones in the United Arab Emirates


# Designated Freezones in the United Arab Emirates



**Designated Freezones in the United Arab Emirates** are special areas in the United Arab Emirates that are subject to special rules for supplies of goods within the region for VAT purposes. They are instrumental components of the country's economic landscape, contributing significantly to its development and global standing. Established to diversify the economy away from oil dependence, these zones serve as pivotal entities fostering international trade, foreign investment and economic growth.


## History

The establishment of designated freezones in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) traces its roots to the nation's strategic vision for economic diversification. In the late 20th century, recognizing the need to reduce reliance on oil revenue, the UAE embarked on a deliberate initiative to create economic zones that would attract foreign investment, promote international trade, and foster innovation. This led to the inception of the first freezone, Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA), in 1985, marking a pivotal moment in the economic history of the UAE. The success of JAFZA catalyzed the replication of the freezone model across the Emirates, with each designated area tailored to cater to specific industries.


## Tax Environment in Designated freezones

One of the key attractions for businesses operating within designated freezones in the United Arab Emirates is the favourable tax environment. The UAE, known for its business-friendly policies, has implemented a tax regime in freezones that differs from the broader national taxation system. Designated freezones typically offer companies complete or substantial exemption from corporate and personal taxes for a specified period. Qualifying Free Zone Persons can benefit from the 0% corporate tax rate on income derived from the wholesale distribution of goods or materials (i.e., not to the end consumer) from a Designated Zone to domestic and foreign businesses. Additionally, businesses within these zones benefit from full repatriation of profits and capital, further enhancing the appeal of operating within the freezone framework. This tax-friendly approach is a strategic component of the UAE's efforts to attract foreign investment, stimulate economic diversification, and promote sustainable business growth. As a result, designated freezones have become incubators for both local and international enterprises seeking a tax-efficient and supportive business environment. Tax policies may vary slightly among different freezones, and potential investors are encouraged to review the specific regulations of each zone for accurate and up-to-date information.
