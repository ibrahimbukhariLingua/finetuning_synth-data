Jyoti Kanyal of *India Today* gave the movie 2.5 out of 5 stars calling it “an interesting watch, which often oscillates between boredom and excitement.”

Ronak Kotecha of *Times of India* graded the film with 3 out of 5 stars and asked not to let the 'stock of expectations rise too high'. He opined that Abhishek Bachchan 'delivered a decent performance'. In conclusion of review he wrote, "Overall, *The Big Bull* is a decent attempt to tell a dramatic story of one of India’s biggest financial scams, orchestrated by a man, who seemed more like a common man than a con man."
