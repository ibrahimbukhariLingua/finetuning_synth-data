## History


### 1912 - 2009

Irwin Mitchell was founded by Walter Irwin Mitchell in Sheffield in 1912, concentrating on criminal law. The firm acted on behalf of various gangs during the Sheffield Gang Wars of the 1920s.

For most of the twentieth century, Irwin Mitchell was based solely in Sheffield. Over the course of this period the company evolved into a general practice, becoming particularly well known for its personal injury work. In 1989 the firm opened an office in Birmingham, with a Leeds office opening its doors in 1993 and a London office opening in 1995.

The company also made a number of acquisitions throughout the 1990s. Kershaw Tudor was acquired in 1994, then followed Teeman Levine (1995), Rigbeys (1996), and Braby & Waller in (1998). Irwin Mitchell continued its expansion in the early 2000s, opening a Newcastle office in 2003 as well as acquiring personal injury outfit Lorenzo Zurbrugg that same year.

In 2005 the firm opened two new offices in Spain. The year Irwin Mitchell moved internationally was also the year the firm's annual turnover broke the £100m barrier for the first time. The next year Irwin Mitchell merged with personal injury and medical negligence firm Alexander Harris, which had offices in London, Solihull and Altrincham. This merger was quickly followed with the opening of a Manchester office in early 2007. 2007 also saw the firm get a foothold in Scotland when it acquired Golds, together with its Glasgow office.


### Recent history (2010 - present)

In 2010 Irwin Mitchell became one of the first UK law firms to convert to a legal disciplinary partnership, which allowed non-solicitors to become equity partners in the firm. The following year the firm announced its intention to become an alternative business structure (ABS), in order that it could seek external investment. In preparation for becoming an ABS, the firm created a new holding company.

In 2012 the application to become an alternative business structure was approved by the Solicitor's Regulation Authority. This made Irwin Mitchell the nineteenth law firm to convert to an alternative business structure, and the first to do so under a "multi-licence". Following the approval of the alternative business structure, the firm continued its expansion with a string of acquisitions and office launches over the next three years. This growth was financed in part by a £60m finance package that was announced in 2014, funded by HSBC, Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland.

In 2013 the firm acquired personal injury specialists MPH Solicitors. This was followed in 2014 with new offices being opened in Southampton and Cambridge. Summer 2014 saw the firm launch a joint venture with online insurer esure called IMe Law. This venture involved a team in the firm's Sheffield office providing legal representation for esure customers who have been injured in motor accidents. In November 2014 Irwin Mitchell announced the acquisition of Berkeley Law, a boutique firm based in Mayfair. Berkeley Law was a specialist in advising high net worth individuals from the UK and abroad.

2015 saw Irwin Mitchell open a consulting office in Middlesbrough. Later that year Irwin Mitchell merged with Thomas Eggar, acquiring its network of five offices in London and the South East. The deal created a £250m turnover company and signalled a significant shift in focus, with 50% of the firm's income coming from business and private client work.

In 2016 the firm launched a new proposition targeted at private individuals, called Irwin Mitchell Private Wealth. The proposition consolidated teams from Irwin Mitchell, Thomas Eggar, Berkeley Law and Berkeley Hurrell (Berkeley Law's conveyancing subsidiary).

In July 2019 the firm opened its 15th UK office, in Reading. In May 2022 the firm further expanded by opening offices in Cardiff and Liverpool Today the firm has 17 UK offices in Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Chichester, Gatwick, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Middlesbrough (consulting office), Newbury, Newcastle, Reading, Sheffield and Southampton.

In 2023 Irwin Mitchell's turnover was £271m, with a pre-tax profit of £13.8m. This makes the firm the 21st largest in the UK by global revenue.
