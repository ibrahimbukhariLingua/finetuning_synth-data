Money Observer


# Money Observer



***Money Observer*** was a British monthly personal finance and investment magazine which began as a newspaper supplement in 1979, and in 2008 was acquired from Guardian Media Group by Interactive Investor. Publication ceased in 2020.


## History and profile

First published in October 1979 as a supplement in *The Observer* Sunday newspaper, the magazine expanded from 12 pages to an average of 100 pages per issue. In addition to share tips, the editorial team offered advice on topics ranging from savings accounts to stock broking.

The magazine formed part of the purchase of *The Observer* by Guardian Media Group in 1993; at that time its circulation was almost 24,000.

In 2004 Interactive Investor bought *Moneywise*, another monthly personal finance magazine, from Reader's Digest. In 2008 the company acquired *Money Observer* from the Guardian group, and from then both titles were published by Moneywise Publishing Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of II.

Circulation of *Money Observer* declined to 16,500 in 2018 and 12,000 in 2019. Although the business was profitable, in June 2020 Interactive Investor announced that the August 2020 editions would be the last and that both magazines would cease publication.
