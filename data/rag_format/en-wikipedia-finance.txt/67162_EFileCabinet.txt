# EFileCabinet



**eFileCabinet** is a SaaS-based company headquartered in Lehi, Utah, selling document management software to manage and store documents, content, and records, either on-site or in the cloud.

It was founded in 2001 by James Blaylock to serve clients in the accounting industry where Blaylock worked before founding the company. It has since expanded to service many other industries, including construction, banking, healthcare, insurance, law, manufacturing, retail, oil & gas, transportation, and education. As of January 2016, eFileCabinet had over 160,000 users.


## History

eFileCabinet software began as an internal product designed to store digital records at founder James Blaylock's accounting firm. Word spread about Blaylock's new software, generating demand for the software among other accounting firms. In response to this demand, Blaylock founded eFileCabinet in 2001 to build upon, improve, and market the software.

On July 21, 2007, Matt Peterson replaced James Blaylock as president and CEO of the company. Peterson had served as chief operating officer since joining the company in January 2007. Blaylock moved to serve as chairman of the board.

In 2008, eFileCabinet received $1 million in venture capital from Canopy Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. This allowed eFileCabinet to expand from servicing only accounting firms to various other industries, including government, healthcare, finance, and insurance. In June 2015, the company received a combined $14 million in Series B venture capital funding from California-based venture capital firm Allegis Capital and Signal Peak Ventures in Utah, bringing the company's total funding to $26.05 million. In 2020, they closed a Series C funding round with $11.5 million.
