## History

Common Cents grew from the desire of a four-year-old Nora Gross (co-founder) to feed a homeless man in 1990. That need led her to ask her father (Teddy Gross Co-founder and executive director), how she could help. In 1990, Teddy Gross and Nora Gross conducted the first Penny Harvest in an effort to collect money to feed and clothe New York City's homeless.
