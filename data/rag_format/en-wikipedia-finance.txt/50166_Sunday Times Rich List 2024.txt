Sunday Times Rich List 2024


# Sunday Times Rich List 2024



The ***Sunday Times* Rich List 2024** is the 36th annual survey of the wealthiest people resident in the United Kingdom, published by *The Sunday Times* online on 17 May 2024 and in print on 19 May 2024.

The list was edited by Robert Watts who succeeded long-term compiler Philip Beresford in 2017. He noted that "this year's edition records the largest fall in the billionaire count in the guide's 36-year history, from a peak of 177 in 2022 to 165 this year. It seems the tide is going out and the world's wealthy are starting to leave."

The list was widely reported by other media.
