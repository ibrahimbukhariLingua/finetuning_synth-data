**Vodafone Greece** (officially known as Vodafone-Panafon Hellenic Telecommunications Company S.A, formerly Panafon) is the Greek subsidiary of Vodafone Group Plc. In 2004 it was the leading mobile operator in Greece. Its headquarters are in Chalandri - one of the northern suburbs of Athens.


## Details

Subscriber numbers issued in Greece by Vodafone begin with the three-digit prefixes 694 and 695, followed by a unique seven-digit combination. However, not all such numbers necessarily belong to Vodafone subscribers because of the number portability for mobile telephony networks.

The network name is displayed as "vodafone GR" on most handsets except for Apple/Samsung devices where it has been shortened to display as "vf-GR" As a response to the 2019/20 COVID-19 pandemic, Vodafone has pushed out an update to all compatible devices to replace the network text with *menoume spiti*, which translates to "we're staying home".

On 17 December 2020, the auction for the 5G frequencies was completed. The frequencies that Vodafone gained are as follows:

* 14 blocks on the frequency zone of 3400-3800MHz
* 2 blocks on the frequency zone of 700MHz
* 4 blocks on the frequency zone of 2GHz
* 2 blocks on the frequency zone of 26GHz

Vodafone was the highest bidder for the frequencies spending up to 130 million euros. The 5G network became accessible Vodafone Greece subscribers in January 2021.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ


## History

Vodafone Greece was established in Greece in 1992 under the trade name Panafon – with the participation of Vodafone Group Plc.,France Telecom,Intracom and, Data Bank, and was officially renamed to Vodafone in January 2002,in framework of the changing of his trade name,Panafon. In December 1998, the company listed its shares in the Athens and London stock exchange, while in July 2004 it de-listed from ATHEX. Vodafone Group Plc. is the company’s major shareholder with 99.8% of Vodafone Greece shares. As of 2003, Vodafone has had an exclusive contract with popular pop musician Sakis Rouvas as the spokesperson for the company in the Greek advertising campaign. Rouvas has completed multiple commercials for the company as well as advertising the brand within his music videos and albums. Likewise, Vodafone is the primary sponsor of his large concerts and recordings. While other record labels and artists do advertisements for other mobile companies as an exchange for sponsoring, Vodafone is the only Greek mobile company to be advertised primarily by a sole artist, with Rouvas' effort being a major marketing ploy to youth and young adult consumers.
