Strategic natural gas reserve


# Strategic natural gas reserve



A **Strategic natural gas reserve** is a government funded natural gas storage facility that holds long term stock piles of natural gas as compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas in case of an emergency. After the 2021â€“2023 global energy crisis, there has been several countries in East Asia and India that have signaled a commitment to building national strategic natural gas reserves such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China.


## East Asia

East Asia natural gas commodities tracker is the PLATTS index, and reached as high as $70 per million British thermal units in 2022 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine during the Second Cold War.


### Taiwan

State owned energy firm CPC Corp holds about 11 days worth of natural gas usage in stockpile and is going to increase it to 14 days.


### Japan

Japan is the world's largest importer of LNG and plans to work with the International Energy Agency to help establish and coordinate a strategic natural gas reserve.


### South Korea

South Korea is the third largest importer of LNG and is building its 6th LNG strategic natural gas reserve facility. It keeps nine days worth of winter usage in strategic storage along with an undisclosed amount of commercial stockpile.


### China

State owned CNOOC completed 10-billion-cubic-metres (bcm) of storage in 2023, and plans to have 55-60 bcm by 2025 or 13% of total gas consumption for one year.


## India

The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board in India is putting together a plan as of July 2023 to build strategic natural gas reserves in either abandoned gas wells and underground storage. They currently have no national natural gas reserves.


## United States

As of 2023 there are no national strategic natural gas reserve facilities in the United States.

A 2007 study found that as of May 2004, there was roughly 8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of commercial gas storage capacity in the US, with about 4 Tcf needed to always remain in storage as base gas. Base gas is needed in order to
provide enough pressure for gas to be withdrawn on demand. Therefore, total working
storage capacity is about 4 Tcf. This is equal to approximately 17% of annual
consumption.

Most gas storage is in depleted gas or oil fields, with the second largest storage capacity
being in aquifers, and the smallest in salt caverns. Depleted gas or oil fields are the
cheapest to commission, as they take advantage of existing wells, internal distribution
systems, and pipeline connections. They are also widely available.


## Europe

The European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson plans to green energy transition Europe to renewable energy instead of a strategic natural gas reserve.
