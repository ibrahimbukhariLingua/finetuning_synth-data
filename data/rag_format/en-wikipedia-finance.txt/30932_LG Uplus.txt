## History

After a decision of the state-owned Korea Telecom to sell its cellular business to private investors in 1994, the South Korean government opened the telecommunications sector up to competition. Korea Telecom would later relaunch its cellular business with KT Freetel in 1996. LG entered the wireless communications market in 1996 by acquiring a CDMA license in June and founded a new carrier named LG Telecom, which built a nationwide digital cellular network. In October 1997, PCS cellular service was launched.

In March 1998, in an effort to make itself stand out from the bigger, more established players in the market, LG Telecom launched the world's first commercial cdmaOne data service using PCS technology.

To better position itself to compete in the bundled services market, LG Telecom acquired LG Dacom, a fixed-line communications networks and Internet-related service provider and LG Powercom, one of Korea's largest ISPs. On July 1, 2010, LG Telecom switched to its current name, "LG U."

In 2022, the company achieved an annual operating profit of 1 trillion won for the first time, but in 2023, due to an increase in capital expenditure (CAPEX) reached 998 billion won ($751.8 million), a decrease of 7.7% from 2022. Meanwhile, revenue rose 3.4% to 14.37 trillion won and service revenue excluding handset sales rose to 11.64 trillion won (up 2% from 2022). The total number of wireless subscribers or mobile network operator (MNO) and mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) subscribers was about 25.1 million (up 26.1%), and the number of 5G subscribers reached 7.04 million (up 16.2%), exceeding half of the total number of LG Uplus subscribers.
