## History

The company was established as a state-owned company, named Albanian Mobile Communications (AMC), in November 1995, and started commercial operations in May 1996, thus being the first mobile operator in Albania. Instructed by Aleksandër Meksi, the team working on it was led by project manager Bashkim Kasa. The company was privatized in August 2000. Cosmote acquired 85% of AMC's capital share, through COSMO-HOLDING ALBANIA S.A., COSMOTE acquired 97% of the owned subsidiary.

On 16 January 2019, OTE part of Deutsche Telekom agreed to sell the company, at the time branded as Telekom Albania, for €50 million to Albania Telecom Invest, a company owned by the Bulgarian Vivacom owner Spas Roussev and Albanian-born entrepreneur Elvin Guri.

On 10 March 2022, the Albanian Competition Authority approved the sale of ONE Telecommunication in favor of the Hungarian company 4iG. On 21 March, the company itself announced the acquisition of 99.899% indirect stakes in One Telecommunications. This is the second acquisition of a telecommunication company in the Albanian market, following that of ALBtelecom by 4iG, explaining that these two companies are complementary in the Albanian market. Following their acquisition of the telecommunications operations in Albania, Montenegro and Hungary, 4iG had an agreement to transfer the ownership of these companies to Antenna Hungária raising then its stake at the company to 76%

The display name of One is **One.al**, though it might appear on some phones simply as **Telekom.al** or **AMC.**

## Controversy

In 2017, operators changed the duration of their monthly packages to 28 days instead of 30. The matter was investigated by the Authority and the operators were ordered to resume the 30-day duration once again.

In 2019, the Albanian Competition Authority intervened after Vodafone Albania, Telekom Albania, and Albtelecom increased their tariffs by ALL 200 and doubled the minimum recharge value from ALL 100 to ALL 200. The move sparked strong reactions from consumers who felt that the high price increase across three of the main providers was unfair. The action was reported to the Competition Authority. The three companies took action to lower the prices, following the instructions given by the agency.
