Valeant proposed to exchange $48.30 in cash and 0.83 shares of Valeant per Allergan share. Allergan, Inc. stockholders would own 43 per cent of the combined company. This bid was rejected by Allergan as being too risky, claiming Valeant's business model of serial acquisitions and low organic growth being unsustainable. Soon after Valeant released a statement saying a new offer will be presented May 28, 2014, where it emerged that Valeant had increased their offer to $49.4 billion.

On the same day Allergan announced that they had set a December shareholder vote to decide whether the company should replace part of the board of directors. In the afternoon of August 27, *Bloomberg* reported that Valeant and Pershing Square had won their case with the Chancery Judge setting an October 6 date for the aforementioned trial.
