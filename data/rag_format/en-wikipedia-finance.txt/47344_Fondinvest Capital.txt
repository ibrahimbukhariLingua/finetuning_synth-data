# Fondinvest Capital



**Fondinvest Capital** is a French private equity firm, focused on European lower and mid-market private equity funds.
The firm was founded in 1994 by Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations ("CDC"), the French state-owned financial institution, as an internal unit to manage private equity investments. The firm has also been the investment manager of a family of funds offered to external institutional investors, which include public and private pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, banks, and sovereign wealth funds.
The group has deployed over €2 billion in primary funds of funds, secondaries funds and separately managed accounts for institutional investors in Europe, the US, the Middle East and Asia.


## History

Charles Soulignac, Fondinvest’s Founder while working at CDC and Managing Director, managed and developed from 1989 to 1993 various investments in private equity funds that the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations ("CDC") made during the 1980s. In 1994, he established Fondinvest Capital for CDC. Fondinvest continued to manage and develop CDC’s investment program in private equity funds and to include third party investors in future fund of funds vehicles.
In 2006, Fondinvest Capital spun off from CDC and became independent. Fondinvest continues to manage capital for CDC and other French public institutions.
