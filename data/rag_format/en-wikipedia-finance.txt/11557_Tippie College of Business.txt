In 1908, "Commerce" was added to the school name, which then featured nearly 40 courses. In 1921, the College of Commerce was born, enrolling approximately 100 students with 23 faculty members. Two years later, the college joined the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
