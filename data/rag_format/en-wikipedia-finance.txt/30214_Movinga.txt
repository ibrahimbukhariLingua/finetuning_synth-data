# Movinga



**Movinga** is an insolvent online platform-based moving company with its official headquarters at Moabit, Berlin, Germany. Movinga was founded in 2015.

In January 2024 the company started the proceedings to declare insolvency.


## History

Founded by Bastian Knutzen and Chris Maslowski in 2016, the company began by booking household moving services for students online. In May 2015, they moved their headquarters from Vallendar to Berlin. Later, the MVP version of the platform was released - a home removal platform built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Grape, Babel. In 2016, the company was active in at least seven countries. Today, Silvio Hinteregger and Tobias Hinteregger are the CEOs of the company.

Once the customer accepts the quoted price, the process is initiated, and the task completed. SMACC, in a digitized process, handles all the invoices of Movinga. The company has also leased street scooters (Electric Minivans) for transportation.


## Capital

Movinga has raised a total of $92.9M in funding from over six rounds of funding.

Movinga has acquired shares in Move24 and Transfer24.
