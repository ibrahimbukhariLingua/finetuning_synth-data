**Nikkei Consumer News and Business Channel**, known as **Nikkei CNBC** (日経CNBC) is a business and financial news television channel broadcast in Japan. It is owned primarily by CNBC Asia and Japanese media group Nikkei, Inc. and its subsidiary, TV Tokyo Holdings Corporation.

The channel is a result of the merger of the former **Nikkei Satellite News** (launched 1990) and **Asia Business News** (launched 1997, renamed **CNBC Business News** in 1998) by an agreement with CNBC Asia and Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
