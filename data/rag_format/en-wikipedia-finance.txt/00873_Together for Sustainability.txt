Together for Sustainability


# Together for Sustainability



**Together for Sustainability** AISBL (TfS) is a joint initiative of chemical companies, founded in 2011. It focuses on the promotion of sustainability practices in the chemical industry's supply chain, currently gathering chemical companies around a single standard of auditing and assessment.


## Sustainability in chemical supply chains

Over the past few years sustainability aspects in the chemical industry have become more important and holistic. Nowadays, chemical companies' measures focusing sustainability include apart from ecological aspects also social concerns and collaborative issues.

Today, it has been well accepted that the creation of sustainable chemical supply chains requires a joint effort beyond individual businesses. These efforts should integrate chemical companies, suppliers, customers as well as consumers.

Prof. Dr Wolfgang Stolze and Marc Müller of the University of St. Gallen summarize the development in the chemical industry in recent years as follows: "The scope of sustainability in the chemical industry has evolved from a firm-level construct with a strong focus on green aspects to a chain-level approach attempting to address the triple bottom line of economic, social and environmental elements."


## History

The Together for Sustainability initiative was founded in 2011 by BASF, Bayer, Evonik, Henkel, Lanxess, and Solvay. The objective was to develop a global supplier engagement program and improve their own sustainability sourcing practices in line with the United Nations Global Compact. Since January 2015, the TfS initiative is incorporated as an international non-profit association according to the Belgian law.

Since June 2012, TfS conducts assessments and audits by independent experts, as well as the early partnership with the French company EcoVadis, which provided with sustainability scorecards and benchmarks.

In June 2023, Jennifer Jewson, CPO of LyondellBasell, was elected as president of the TfS.


## Structure

The TfS is governed by two main organs, the General Assembly and the Steering Committee.
The General Assembly is formed by all the Chief Procurement Officers of the member companies, and holds power over the direction and structure of the organization, as well as approving the decisions of the Steering Committee.
The Steering Committee, formed by six elected members of the General Assembly as well as the TfS president, is the executive council of the organization and decides upon its activities and projects.

Additionally, TfS has several Regional Operating Committees (Asia, North America and South America) as well as, currently, five mission-specific work streams led and staffed by participants from the TfS member companies:

* Work Stream 1: Governance and Partnerships
* Work Stream 2: TfS Assessments
* Work Stream 3: TfS Audits
* Work Stream 4: TfS Communications and Capability Building
* Work Stream 5: Scope 3 GHG Emissions

TfS' headquarter is in Brussels. It manages the day-to-day affairs of the organization and stays in close contact with the representatives and coordinators of the member companies.

TfS has a partnership with several other chemical industry associations: American Chemistry Council (ACC), European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), German Chemistry Council (VCI), China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF), Indian Chemical Council (ICC), and the Associação Brasileira da Indústria Química (ABIQUIM).


## Members

TfS Membership is open to all companies in the chemical industry who subscribe to the United Nations Global Compact, Responsible Care, and show a commitment to sustainability. TfS membership has been growing steadily since its founding, and in April 2022 its members have a joint global turnover of over €500 billion.

As of February 2025, TfS has 55 member companies.
