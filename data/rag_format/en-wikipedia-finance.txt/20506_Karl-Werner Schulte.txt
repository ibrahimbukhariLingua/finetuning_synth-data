**Karl-Werner Schulte** (born 8 June 1946 in Warstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) is a German Professor of Real Estate at the IREBS International Real Estate Business School, University of Regensburg and was Founder and Academic Director of the IREBS Real Estate Academy, formerly EBS Real Estate Academy.


## Life

Schulte studied Business Administration at the University of Muenster and graduated 1970 as "Diplom-Kaufmann" (MBA or MSc Business equivalent). In 1974 he was awarded a Doctoral Degree (Dr. rer.pol.) and promoted to Senior Lecturer and some years later to Reader at the University of Muenster. In 1986 he was appointed Professor of Investment & Finance at the EBS European Business School, located near Frankfurt.

In 1990 Karl-Werner Schulte and his wife Dr. Gisela Schulte-Daxbök founded the EBS Real Estate Academy, the first institution in Germany which offered executive education for real estate practitioners. Schulte was academic director for about 15 years. In 1992 the executive part time course in Real Estate became the first course which the RICS Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors accredited in Continental Europe. In 1994 he raised funds from leading real estate firms in Europe for an Endowed Chair of Real Estate which he took over. He established real estate as a major in the "Diplom-Kaufmann" degree course to become the first course with this specification worldwide which received RICS accreditation. By the appointment of further professors the Department of Real Estate was established and led by him for several years.
In 2006 the Department of Real Estate (nearly all professors and donors) and the Real Estate Academy moved to the University of Regensburg where Karl-Werner Schulte initiated the IREBS International Real Estate Business School and became the holder of the ECE Endowed Professorship and the Academic Director of the IREBS Real Estate Academy. When he retired in 2011 the IREBS International Real Estate Business School had developed into one of the leading academic real estate centers worldwide.

Karl-Werner Schulte still plays an active role in real estate education and research at IREBS. He is the Founder and Academic Director of the Center for African Real Estate Research and the co-founder and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the homonymous non-profit Foundation (www.afrer.org) which supports doctoral and master students as well as the development of real estate departments at universities in African countries. The research center and the foundation collaborate with the African Real Estate Society which is part of the IRES International Real Estate Society network.
On the occasion of his 70th birthday in 2016 the ERES European Real Estate Society held its Annual Conference at the University of Regensburg and the IREBS International Real Estate Business School honoured him with the symposium "Real Estate Research & Practice - Past, Present and Future".
