## Criticism


### Advertising tobacco to children

Ströer has used loopholes in national legislation to advertise for tobacco, specifically targeting young people, despite European laws prohibiting nicotine marketing in public places. In German cities, as of 2019 notably Mainz and Hildesheim, the company has repeatedly placed advertising signs directly in front of schools, Kindergartens and playgrounds.
