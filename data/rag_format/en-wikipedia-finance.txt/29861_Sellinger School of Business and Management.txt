# Sellinger School of Business and Management



**The Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management** is the business school of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College in Maryland) and is located on the college's main campus in Baltimore, Maryland. Formally established in 1980, the business school was named in honor of Loyola's late president Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J., although the university has been offering courses in business for over 70 years. The Sellinger School consists of seven academic departments: Accounting, Economics, Finance, Information Systems/ Operations Management, Management/International Business, Marketing, and Law & Social Responsibility. The Sellinger School of Business and Management is one of Loyola's three schools, the other two being the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education.


## History

Loyola College first offered accounting and business administration courses at the undergraduate level in 1937. The baccalaureate degree in business administration was first awarded in 1943, with the accounting major added shortly thereafter. Loyola introduced the Executive MBA program in 1973, the first of its kind in the Baltimore-Washington area and one of the first ten Executive MBA programs.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Loyola established the School of Business and Management in 1980 to provide strategic management for business programs. In 1984, the business school was formally named The Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of the late Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger. In 1985, the Sellinger School initiated the Fellows MBA program to serve rising young executives. In 1988, the Sellinger School earned accreditation in all programs by AACSB (The International Association for Management Education). In early 2000, the Sellinger School moved into a new state-of-the-art facility constructed on the north side of the academic quadrangle.

In July 2021, then dean Kathleen Getz left to become president of Mercyhurst University. In the same month, accounting professor and associate dean for academics, Bobby Waldrup, was appointed interim dean of the Sellinger School. Waldrup's tenure as dean lasted until July 2022, when former CEO of Howard Bank Mary Ann Scully took over the role. As of May 2023, Scully is dean of the school.


## Jesuit Education

Loyola University Maryland is a Jesuit Catholic university committed to the educational and spiritual traditions of the Society of Jesus and to the ideals of liberal education and the development of the whole person. Accordingly, the College will inspire students to learn, lead and serve in a diverse and changing world.

In this mission the hallmarks of a Jesuit education are clearly evident: a commitment to the rich tradition of Catholic education, an emphasis on academic excellence, the importance of the liberal arts, and the education of the whole person. At Loyola, this means that the curriculum is rigorous and faculty expectations are high. All undergraduates complete the core curriculum that includes courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, science, and social sciences. Students are challenged to understand the ethical dimensions of personal and professional life and to examine their own values, attitudes, and beliefs. The College sponsors a variety of programs and opportunities in support of its Jesuit mission; these include the Center for Values and Service, Campus Ministry, and Catholic Studies.


## Academics

The Sellinger School stresses the importance of Experiential Learning, noting that such opportunity serves to enhance traditional classroom work through the integration of theory and practice. Students are offered the chance for enriched academic discussion and a broadened learning environment through Internship, Study Abroad, and Service-Learning Experiences. Two of the three are required for graduation from the Sellinger School.

The college recognizes chapters of Beta Gamma Sigma and Beta Alpha Psi, and affords students international societies such as the Financial Management Association for academic growth and development. The Sellinger Scholars business honors program was developed to prepare highly motivated students for roles of leadership and service in a diverse and changing world. Students are invited to join in their Freshmen year based on academic achievement and must then go through an interview process.
