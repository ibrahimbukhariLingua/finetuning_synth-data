## Season 3: Ryan Jenkins

*I Love Money 3* would have been a follow-up to the previous seasons of the show. The contestants were to be selected from other VH1 reality shows such as *Flavor of Love*, *Rock of Love with Bret Michaels*, *I Love New York*, *Real Chance of Love*, *For the Love of Ray J*, *Daisy of Love*, and *Megan Wants a Millionaire*. Production began in late June 2009 and wrapped early August 2009, with Craig J. Jackson returning to host. Ryan Alexander Jenkins was the winner.

Reportedly, *I Love Money 3* was set to air in January 2010. In August 2009, VH1 canceled any showings of season three due to castmember Ryan Jenkins's involvement in the murder of Jasmine Fiore, as well as Jenkins's suicide. It had been revealed that Jenkins had been convicted for assault in 2007. However, due to a lapse by the firm subcontracted to vet Jenkins, this was not been disclosed to VH1 or 51 Minds. According to 51 Minds officials, had Jenkins' record been known, he would have never been allowed on any 51 Minds show.

The girls who competed were Deelishis and Buckeey from *Flavor of Love*, Lacey Conner and Marcia "Brazil' Alves from *Rock of Love*, Bubbles from *Real Chance of Love* and Lil Hood, Cashmere, and Cocktail from *For the Love of Ray J*. The boys who competed were Wolf and Pretty from *I Love New York*, Fox, Sinister, Weasel, Big Rig, and Professor from *Daisy of Love*, and Joe Pascolla and Ryan Jenkins from *Megan Wants a Millionaire*. As of 2025, the third season remains unreleased.

On May 9, 2020, Lil Hood, Weasel, Big Rig, and Joe participated in a one-time tell-all on YouTube. Lil Hood stated in the intro that the cast would not mention Jenkins or Jasmine Fiore; rather, they would just focus on what happened in the show.

On November 23, 2020, Cocktail made a guest appearance on Lacey's Talk of Love Podcast to talk about everything she remembered from her time on the show.

In April 2024, Buckeey briefly talked about her experience on the show in an interview with Carlos King, in which she confirms Ryan Jenkins was the winner of the show.


## Season 4

*I Love Money 4* was meant to be the follow-up to *I Love Money 3*. Production began in August 2009, immediately after the finish of filming for season three. In April 2010, it was confirmed by VH1 executive vice president Jeff Olde that neither season would air. Despite earlier indicating that the season would not air, it was later reported that the season had been placed into a late night time slot in September 2010, though viewer demand encouraged VH1 to later move the episode premiere to a prime time Wednesday time slot. It was mentioned by contestants the production and editing of the show were affected by the scandal of the murder of Jasmine Fiore, meaning that some of the alcohol and heated scenes were cut. The contestants were selected from the shows *Rock of Love*, *I Love New York*, *Real Chance of Love*, *For the Love of Ray J*, *Daisy of Love*, and *Megan Wants a Millionaire*. They competed in physical and mental challenges in an attempt to win $250,000. The show premiered on September 16, 2010 under the name of just "I Love Money", with Craig J. Jackson as the host. The winner was *Rock of Love'*s Mindy Hall.
