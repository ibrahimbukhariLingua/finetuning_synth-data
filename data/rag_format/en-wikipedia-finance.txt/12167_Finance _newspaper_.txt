Finance (newspaper)


# Finance (newspaper)



The ***Finance Business Daily*** (Slovene: *Poslovni dnevnik Finance*; *Finance* meaning *Finances*) is the only daily Slovenian business and financial newspaper. The idea to publish it had already been proposed by Iztok Jurančič before 1991, when Slovenia declared its independence. However, it was realized only in 1992. At first, the newspaper was published by the company Gospodarski Vestnik. Today, it is published by the Časnik Finance company, which is owned by the Swedish Bonnier Group and also publishes several other publications; for example, the magazines *Manager* and *Moje finance*, the healthcare newspaper *Medicina danes*, and the web portals *Finance* and *Mojevro*. As of 2008, the Finance Business Daily accounted for three quarter of the Časnik Finance company income. Before becoming a daily newspaper in 2002, *Finance* was issued twice weekly.
