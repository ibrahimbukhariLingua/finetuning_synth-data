His investments through Difference Capital include the film and television studio Thunderbird Films, the data analysis firm Appinions, the medical technology firm BrainScope, the social media management service HootSuite, and the technology firm Vision Critical.

At a charity fundraising roast for Newcap Broadcasting CEO Rob Steele that summer, he drunkenly interrupted host Rex Murphy, and in October he arrived drunk at a hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas, and allegedly engaged in rowdy and disorderly behaviour. A valet with the hotel filed a lawsuit against Wekerle in 2013, alleging that he had suffered a permanent injury as a result of Wekerle's behaviour.
