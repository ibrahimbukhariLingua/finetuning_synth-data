## History

The Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited (or named Krungsri) officially opened its doors on April 1, 1945 and located on Talad Hua Ro Road, Hua Ro Sub-district, Krung Kao District, Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province. The Bank later opened its Bangkok office on Ratchawong Road, opposite the corner of Songwad Road, right at the heart of Bangkok’s vibrant business district at the time.

The Bank’s 25th anniversary in 1970 was marked with very auspicious event as the Bank was granted the royal warrant of appointment permitting the Bank to auspiciously display the Royal Garuda Emblem at the Head Office, thanks to the public’s trust in the Bank.

The Bank subsequently relocated its Head Office to a new building on Ploenchit Road. The new Head Office was considered one of the most modern office buildings in Asia at the time. The Bank found immediate public favor, grew rapidly, and listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand on September 26, 1977.

In 1993, the Bank became a public company, and four year later was relocated to a new 36-story Head Office on Rama III Road.

In January 2007, Krungsri and GE Money, a global consumer financial services firm, have successfully become strategic partners, reflecting GE's commitment and confidence in Krungsri. The goal is to leverage the synergy of the two organizations enabling Krungsri to become a leading universal bank in Thailand.

In September 2012, GE Group informed the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it sold Krungsri’s 461,635,000 ordinary shares held by GECIH or amounting to 7.60 percent of all issued shares (6,074,143,747 ordinary shares) through private placement in SET. Consequently, GECIH held 1,538,365,000 ordinary shares or amounting to 25.33 percent of all issued shares (6,074,143,747 ordinary shares).

In 2013, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU), which is wholly owned by the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest financial group and one of the world’s largest, made a voluntary tender offer (VTO) for all of Krungsri’s 6,074,143,747 ordinary shares at 39 baht per share. The purchase period ran from November 7 to December 13, 2013 (only business days), and GECIH sold Krungsri’s 1,538,365,000 ordinary shares, or 25.33 percent of all issued shares, under the same VTO arrangement (at

the tender offer price), to MUFG Bank.

Then on December 18, 2013, Krungsri was informed by MUFG Bank that the shareholders (including GECIH) had expressed their intention to sell their 4,373,714,120 shares in Krungsri, representing 72.01 percent of total issued shares, to MUFG Bank. As a result, MUFG Bank became Krungsri’s major shareholder.

In September 2017, Krungsri was recognized as “A Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB)” by the Bank of Thailand, playing a key role in driving the country’s economic engines and financial system.


## Name and brand

After having undergone changes in the late 2000s, including the acquisition of GE Money Thailand, and Bank of Ayudhya unified its subsidiaries and rebranded. In 2014, the bank rebranded as "Krungsri" (shortened from กรุงศรีอยุธยา, "capital city/revered city Ayutthaya"), the bank's formal name and use tagline Make Life Simple. In the media, the formal and colloquial names are used interchangeably, while for the bank's own marketing (such as logos, URL, storefronts, ATMs, bank cards and promotional material) "Krungsri" is used.

In February 2023, Krungsri launched its brand refresh and updated Thai slogan of “Make Life Simple” (“ชีวิตง่าย ได้ทุกวัน”), which will be used to drive business across Krungsri Group, elevate Krungsri branding to be relevant to today’s context, continue responding to the customers’ needs and behaviors, reflect the organization’s core value, and help drive Krungsri towards its business goals today and tomorrow.
