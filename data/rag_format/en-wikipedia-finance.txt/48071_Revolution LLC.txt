# Revolution LLC



**Revolution LLC** is an American investment firm based in Washington, D.C., founded in 2005 by AOL co-founder Steve Case, after leaving the AOL Time Warner board. The firm seeks to fund entrepreneurs who are transforming legacy industries with innovative products and services, with an overarching focus on companies that are based outside of the coastal tech hubs of New York City, San Francisco, and Boston. Through the firm's Rise of the Rest platform, it has developed a network of business and civic relationships that helps Revolution source investments and support existing companies as they seek to expand across the country. Notable investments include LivingSocial, Zipcar, DraftKings, and sweetgreen.


## Foundation

Revolution LLC was founded in 2005 by Steve Case, a well-known entrepreneur and a co-founder of America Online (AOL), the first Internet company in the world to go public along with Donn Davis and Tige Savage. After negotiating the merger of AOL and Time Warner, a transaction that today remains the largest merger in business history, AOL Time Warner floundered and Case resigned from his post in January 2003, with the merger often cited as one of the worst mergers ever. After leaving the AOL Time Warner board in 2005, Case co-founded venture capital firm, Revolution LLC, where he is the chairman and CEO.
