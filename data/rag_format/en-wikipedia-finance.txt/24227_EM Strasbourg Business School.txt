# EM Strasbourg Business School



**EM Strasbourg Business School**, formerly the **Institut d'Etudes Supérieures Spécialisées** (**IECS**) is a French business school created in 1919 in Strasbourg, Alsace.


## History

In 1919, at the initiative of the Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie (CCI), the Institut d'Etudes Supérieures Spécialiséesᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, or European Institute for Higher Business Studies, (IECS) was created.

In 1956, in accordance with the CCI, the IECS was attached to the University of Strasbourg and the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research, thus becoming the only French business school tied to a traditional university.

In 1999, the IECS moved to a new building, the PEGE (European Center of Management and Economics). The building covers 26,000 m² (280,000 sq ft), over four levels.

On 12 October 2007 the school underwent a strategic merger with the IAE of Strasbourg, forming a new entity, named the EM Strasbourg Business School.

The school was the first French public institution to get a four-year "diversity" label issued by AFNOR in 2012.

In 2015, the School was accredited AACSB.
