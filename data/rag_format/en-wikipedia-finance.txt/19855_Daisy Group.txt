## History

The Daisy Group was founded in 2001 by Founder and Chairman Matthew Riley, who aimed to disrupt a monopolized business market and target an under-resourced business community with the benefit of being bound to no single network or supplier.

From a small start-up, the business experienced rapid organic growth and was named the fastest-growing technology business in the UK in the 2005 Sunday Times’ Tech Track.

In 2009, the business floated on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). In December 2014, Daisy once again became a private company in order to embark on its next stage of growth.
