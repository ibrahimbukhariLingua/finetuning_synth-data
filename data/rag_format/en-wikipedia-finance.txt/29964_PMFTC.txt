## History

In 1955, Philip Morris International entered into a licensing agreement with La Suerte Cigar and Cigarette Factory to manufacture and sell Marlboro cigarettes in the Philippines.

Fortune Tobacco Corporation (FTC) was established in 1966, founded by Benito Tan Kee Hiong, Atty. Florencio N. Santos, Lucio Tan and Mariano Tanenglian.

In 1995, Philip Morris Philippines, Inc. (PMPI) was established to handle all sales and marketing aspects related to the Marlboro and Philip Morris brands.

In 2002, the licensing agreement with La Suerte was terminated and Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing, Inc. (PMPMI) was established to handle all aspects of the Philippine business, including manufacturing operations. PMPI was subsequently merged with PMPMI. A new factory located in Tanauan, Batangas was inaugurated by PMPMI in 2003.

On February 25, 2010, PMI and Fortune Tobacco Corporation (FTC) signed an agreement to unite their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of both companies to a new company named PMFTC, Inc., with each party holding an equal economic interest. The agreement stated that PMI retained its export business, while FTC kept its interest in the distribution of the Winston brand of Japan Tobacco. PMFTC would not be affected by pending tax and ownership disputes with local courts involving FTC.

On June 1, 2021, when PMFTC Inc., which the group indirectly owns through Fortune Tobacco Corporation, obtained board approval to merge with Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing, Inc. and PMFTC would be the surviving corporation.
