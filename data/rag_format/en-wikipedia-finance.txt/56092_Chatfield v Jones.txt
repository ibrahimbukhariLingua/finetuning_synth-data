Chatfield v Jones


# Chatfield v Jones



**Chatfield v Jones** [1990] 3 NZLR 285 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the issue of notice of cancellation of a contract, where a contract has been breached.


## Background

In November 1986, the parties agreed to transfer the shares in Acorn (Fiji) Limited, which operated a tourist train, in the Coral Coast, Fiji for $875,000. When the purchasers neglected to pay for the shares the following year, the shares were resold for $100,000, and sued the purchasers for the loss.

The purchasers defended the claim, saying they were not notified of the cancellation of the contract.


## Held

Held, the court ruled that the vendors statement of claim notified them that the contract had been cancelled.
