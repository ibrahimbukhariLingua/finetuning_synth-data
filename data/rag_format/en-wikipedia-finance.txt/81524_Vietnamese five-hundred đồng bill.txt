Vietnamese five-hundred đồng bill


# Vietnamese five-hundred đồng bill



The **Vietnamese five-hundred dong bill** (Vietnamese: 500 đồng),is the third smallest denomination of Vietnamese currency. Although it was first issued in 1989, some bills are marked as being printed in 1988, when they were manufactured.
The bill remains in circulation, however due to its low value (roughly US$0.03) it is rarely used in commercial transactions, instead being seen as a collectible or oddity.
