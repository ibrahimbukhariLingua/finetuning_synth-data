# 't Hof van Commerce



**'t Hof van Commerce** is a Belgian hip hop crew from Izegem in the province West Flanders in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Their name means 'commercial court' in their local dialect. Almost all their raps/lyrics are in West Flemish, the Dutch dialect of the province of West Flanders, with the exception of some lines sung in Limburgish by DJ 4T4 or a mix between those two dialects.

Band members are Filip Cauwelier (a.k.a. Levrancier, a.k.a. Flip Kowlier), Serge Buyse (a.k.a. Dommestik, a.k.a. BZA, pronounce: *buzze*) and Kristof Michiels (DJ 4T4). Ex-members include Johnny de Pony (a.k.a. Georges De Keesmaecker) and Floerke den Aap (a.k.a. Wilhelm De Tura).


## History

It started with the crossover band *The Prophets of Finance* which stopped around 1993â€“1994. In 1997, '*t Hof van Commerce* was founded, and in 1998, they release their first album *En in Izzegem*, referring to the little city Izegem where the band was founded. About 8000 albums were sold. That was quite a high number for a debut because the entire CD was sung in West Flemish, only understood by about one million people. The next year, they already had a second CD with the title *Herman*. That album was sold 5000 times.

In 2000 Flip Kowlier started a successful solo career as a singer-songwriter, while staying a member of *'t Hof van Commerce*. Two years later, in 2002, they got their third album, titled *Rocky 7*. That album was their biggest success this far, with 10 000 sells. So in 2003, '*t Hof* (how they call themselves) was asked a lot in festivals in Belgium and the Netherlands.

In 2005, '*t Hof* released another album with the title *Ezoa en niet anders* *(This way and not differently)*. For the first time under their own record label *Plasticine*. For that record, a lot of guest rappers were invited such as TLP and Gabriel Rios.

In 2011, Flip Kowlier temporarily stopped his (still successful) solo career, to continue with '*t Hof van Commerce* after a long silence. This resulted in a new album in 2012 with the title *Stuntman*.

'*t Hof van Commerce* has been on hiatus between October 2013 and January 2018.
