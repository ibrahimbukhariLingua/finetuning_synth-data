## Government and politics

As Chief Administrative Officer of New Castle County, Grimaldi managed the day-to-day operations of Delaware's largest municipal government and supervised a workforce of 2000 employees with a $250 million annual operating and $1 billion long term capital budget. Under his supervision, New Castle County experienced a huge financial turnaround, which ended a near decade of annual deficits and produced the only two years of back-to-back surplus during that time. Deficit spending resumed after his departure from New Castle County.

Grimaldi was the architect of the New Castle County's economic development strategies, which included the first-ever comprehensive economic development plan and a deal, with former NYSE CEO Richard Grasso and Former UBS CEO Joseph J. Grano Jr., to open a venture stock exchange in Wilmington. The deal began to unraveled as the two Wall St CEO's pulled out following Grimaldi's exit from New Castle County.

As Campaign Manager for Tom Gordon 2012, Grimaldi managed an upset victory campaign which led to the historic political comeback of Thomas P Gordon. Gordon, whose political career ended with a highly publicized 2002 federal corruption indictment, attempted a 2008 comeback but lost to then New Castle County Executive Chris Coons by a near two-to-one margin. In 2012, Gordon again attempted a comeback and challenged then County Executive Paul Clark. Gordon would go on to defeat Clark, the democratic party endorsed incumbent in the 2012 democratic primary election. Gordon credited Grimaldi with his upset victory.
