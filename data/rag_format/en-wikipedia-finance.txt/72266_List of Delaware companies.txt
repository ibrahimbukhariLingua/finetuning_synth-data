List of Delaware companies


# List of Delaware companies



Delaware is a state in the Northeastern United States. Delaware's economy shifted to a manufacturing base in the late 19th century, led by the transformation of the DuPont Company. Modern growth in the financial workforce has overtaken the manufacturing sector in the state's economy. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides a flexible and stable framework for national incorporation. While they are seldom headquartered in the state, the management-friendly and mature legal system attracts many corporations; over 66% of the Fortune 500 are incorporated in Delaware.
