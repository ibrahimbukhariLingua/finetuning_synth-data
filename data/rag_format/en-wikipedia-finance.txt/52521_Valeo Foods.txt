## History

Valeo Foods was established in September 2010 through the merger of Batchelors, a manufacturer and retail category partner of a number of Irish food and drink brands, and Origin Foods, the food division of Irish-based Origin Enterprises Plc which included the Odlums, Shamrock and Roma brands.

In August 2011, the company acquired Jacob Fruitfield, a producer of biscuits, sauces and preserves, creating Ireland’s largest ambient food (shelf-stable food) supplier to the grocery trade and a supplier to the UK market. In March 2014, Valeo Foods added Rowse Honey, the largest producer of honey and the category leader in the UK, to its brands.

In June 2015, Valeo Foods announced its acquisition of Dolciaria Balconi, an Italian food producer that specializes in sponge cake, wafers and biscuits.

On 28 July 2015, Origin Enterprises plc announced the disposal of its 32% equity interest in the consumer foods group Valeo Foods Group Limited to CapVest Partners LLP.

In August 2018, Valeo Foods announced completion of its acquisition of Tangerine Confectionery.

In 2019, Valeo Foods sold Nimbus Foods Limited to the dairy company Meadow Foods Limited. In 2019 Valeo bought Kettle, which makes crisps. In 2020 the company acquired It's All Good, which manufactures tortilla chips. As of 2021 Valeo was controlling 27 factories, manufacturing in Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. In 2021, CapVest sold Valeo Foods to Bain Capital for over €1.7 billion.
