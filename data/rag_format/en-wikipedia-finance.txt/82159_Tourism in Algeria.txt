Tourism in Algeria


# Tourism in Algeria



Algeria is the largest country in Africa; one of the main tourist attractions is the Sahara, the largest desert in the world. Algeria has been a member of the World Tourism Organization since 1976. According to a report of the World Tourism Organization published in 2014, Algeria was the 4th largest tourist destination in Africa in 2013 with 2.7 million foreign tourists, and ranks 111th on the international tourism scene, according to the London-based World Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC). The tourism sector in Algeria accounts for 3.9% of the volume of exports, 9.5% of the productive investment rate and 8.1% of the gross domestic product.

The main competitors are other Mediterranean countries, the majority of which have developed a strong tourism-based economy. The tourism sector in Algeria remains weak concerning accommodation and other services. For this reason, the government launched a strategic plan to boost this sector entitled “The 2030 Master Plan for Tourism Development”.

According to the U.S. News & World Report, Algeria was ranked among the top 80 countries in the world in 2018.

The US national newspaper USA Today ranked Constantine among the eleven cities to visit the world in 2018. The newspaper was based on the experience of Sal Lavallo, one of the youngest people to have visited all 193 member states of the United Nations.


## Tourism policy of the state

A project developed during the "National and International Conference of Tourism" was born providing a new dynamics of reception and management of tourism in Algeria. This project is called (Horizon 2025). Foreign investors, mainly French, position themselves to dominate the market, focused mainly on a business clientele.

An initial advertising campaign was rolled out to attract investors and foreign customers, along with conferences, trade shows and commissions.

The World Cup-winning former footballer Zinedine Zidane of Algerian descent was also used for a new commercial carried out under the aegis of the telephony operator, Ooredoo Algeria, intended for an international audience.

A Quality Tourism Plan Algeria was adopted by the government but by the end of 2010, only 10% of tourist structures in Algeria have joined this program. Investors remain interested in the potential of the country, as well as the high authorities, as the representative of the Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (WTO), Frédéric Perret, told the conference of the International Tourism and Travel Exhibition held In Algeria in 2010, that the Algerian tourism sector has great potential thanks to its "Mediterranean beaches, its fascinating Djurdjura National Park, its human, cultural and historical treasures."

As part of the tourism development policy, 'Eductour' is regularly organized for the national and international.

The Jewish settlers relocating to France in the 1960s were assigned "repatriate" status and classed alongside the European settler population because the Jews of Algeria had been French citizens since the Crémieux Decree of 1870.

## Saharan Tourism

The Algerian Sahara is one of the most important tourist destinations in Algeria, the Great South is a flagship destination internationally. Hiking is not the only way to discover the Sahara, in fact, camel rides on a Meharée camel or in a 4x4 vehicle, or even formulas combining hiking, camel trekking, and 4x4.

The Algerian Desert is located in north-central Africa and is part of the Sahara Desert. The desert occupies more than four-fifths of the Algerian territory. Its expansion starts from the Saharan Atlas, more or less as a stony desert and the farther inland you get the more of a sand dune desert it becomes.

In the southwestern parts is the mountain range Tassili n'Ajjer located. This area is a subject of great archaeological interest and was put up on the "World Heritage List" by UNESCO in 1982. The area is known for extreme aridity and extreme heat, as daytime temperatures are commonly between 46 °C (113 °F) and 51 °C (122 °F) during the hottest period of the year in most of the desert.

Cities and towns such as Ouargla, Touggourt, Beni Abbes, Adrar, In Salah are among the hottest places on Earth during the height of summer. The annual average rainfall is well below 100 mm (3,93 in) in the northernmost part but the center and the southern part receive much less than 50 mm (1,96 in) and are therefore hyper-arid and among the driest places on Earth.

Among the unmissable places of the Sahara in quote:

* Tamanrasset
* Timimoun
* Djanet
* Ouargla
* Béchar

## Cuisine

The cuisine of Algeria is a fusion of Andalusian, Berber, Mediterranean. It differs slightly from region to region. Every region has its own cuisine, including Kabylie, Algiers (couscous) and Constantine.

Algerian cuisine is influenced by various cultures such as Berber, Arabic, and French. Most of the Algerian dishes are centered around lamb or beef, olive oil, fresh vegetables, and fresh herbs. Traditionally, no Algerian meal is complete without bread, normally a long French baguette or more traditionally a flat semolina bread. Pork consumption is forbidden to devout Muslim inhabitants of Algeria in accordance with Sharia, religious laws of Islam.

Algeria, like other Maghreb countries, produces a large range of Mediterranean fruits and vegetables and even some tropical ones. Lamb is commonly consumed. Mediterranean seafood and fish are also eaten and produced by the little inshore fishing.

Algerians consume a high amount of meat, as it is found in almost every dish. Mutton is the most eaten meat in the country. Poultry and beef are also eaten Other uncommon types of meat such as game, birds, and venison are considered a delicacy. Wild boar is also hunted and eaten. While pork is not available in stores, it can only be bought from hunters directly. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Vegetables that are commonly used include potatoes (batata/betetè), carrots (zrodiya), onions (bsel), tomatoes (tomatish/tømètish), zucchini (corget/qar'a), garlic (ethom), cabbages (cromb), and eggplant (badenjan). Olives (zéton) are also used. Vegetables are often used in stews (jwaz/djwizza) and soups (chorba) or simply fried or boiled.

The Kesra, traditional Algerian flatbread, is the base of Algerian cuisine and eaten at many meals. A popular Algerian meal is merguez, an originally Berber sausage.

A common and one of the most popular dishes of Algerian cuisine is couscous, with other common dishes include shakshouka, Karantita, marqa bel a'assel, a speciality from Tlemcen, and chakhchoukha.

Algerians also use tagines, handmade in Algeria. Algerian food is often cooked in clay vessels, much like Maghrib cuisine. Algerian cuisine represents the region north of the Sahara desert and west of the Nile.

Its broken topography, however, provides sharp local contrasts in both prevailing temperatures and incidence of rainfall. Year-to-year variations in climatic conditions are also common. This area, the most inhabited in Algeria, is commonly referred to as the Tell.


## Transportation

As the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean region, Algeria has a vast transportation system which includes many transportation infrastructures.
