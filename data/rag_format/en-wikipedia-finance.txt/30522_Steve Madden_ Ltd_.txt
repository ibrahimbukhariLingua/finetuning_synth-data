## History

Businessman Steve Madden started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car to small Manhattan stores, where their chunky platform look attracted clothing designers, such as Betsey Johnson, who used them in their fashion shows. Steven Madden, Ltd. was incorporated in New York on July 9, 1990, and reincorporated under the same name in Delaware in November 1998. The company went public in 1993, underwritten through Stratton Oakmont. The company reported net sales of US$1.98 billion for 2023.
