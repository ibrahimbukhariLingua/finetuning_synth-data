Phoenix Television


# Phoenix Television



**Phoenix Television** is a majority state-owned television network that offers Mandarin and Cantonese-language channels that serve mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and other markets with substantial Chinese-language viewers. It is headquartered in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. It is also registered in Cayman Islands.

The founder of Phoenix TV, Liu Changle (劉長樂), was an officer and political instructor in the People's Liberation Army in its 40th Group Army. He later became a journalist for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-controlled China National Radio after the Cultural Revolution and remains well-connected to the CCP's leadership. Liu is a standing member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Phoenix Television calls itself a Hong Kong media outlet but holds a non-domestic television programme services license in Hong Kong. Most of the company's customers and non-current assets come from mainland China. Bauhinia Culture, a company wholly owned by the Chinese government, is its largest shareholder. Freedom House describes Phoenix Television as pro-Beijing. Stephen McDonell of BBC News described the outlet as "sometimes more liberal than its mainland counterparts".

The company's head offices are located in Shenzhen, Guangdong and Tai Po, Hong Kong and it also has correspondent offices in Beijing and Shanghai. The Shenzhen office is said to produce half its TV output.


## History

What eventually became Phoenix Television started as a joint venture between Star TV in Hong Kong, one private company in China, and China Central Television.

Phoenix Chinese Channel was launched on 31 March 1996. It replaced Star Chinese Channel in Hong Kong and mainland China. Broadcasts in Singapore started on 1 December 1996 via the Singapore Cable Vision network; in its early years, the Phoenix Chinese Channel also carried Mandarin-dubbed American series during primetime hours, such as *The X-Files* and *Baywatch*.

The Phoenix CNE channel broadcasts in Europe, while the Phoenix North America Chinese Channel goes out in the Americas. In 2005, a California-based broadcast and engineering director for the channel, Tai Wang Mak, was arrested for conspiring with his brother, Chi Mak, to act as an intelligence agent for China. A 10-year prison sentence was announced in 2008.

On 28 March 2011, Phoenix Television launched Phoenix Hong Kong Channel, broadcasting exclusively in Cantonese.

On 31 March 2011, Phoenix InfoNews Channel was announced as a Peabody Award winner for its "Report on a New Generation of Migrant Workers in China."

In 2011, Phoenix New Media formed a partnership with the BBC to offer the British broadcaster's programming on Phoenix's digital media platforms. This was followed by a similar partnership with the National Film Board of Canada in 2012, under which 130 NFB animated shorts and documentary films would be offered digitally in China.

In October 2013, the 12.15% of shares in Phoenix Television held by 21st Century Fox (through Star) were sold to TPG Capital for HK$1.66 billion (US$213 million).

In February 2016, Phoenix Television broadcast forced confessions of kidnapped Hong Kong booksellers.
In June 2020, the FCC ordered XEWW-AM, owned by Phoenix Television, to cease broadcasting.

The Taiwanese government designated Phoenix as a Chinese government-funded company in April 2022, and required the company to end operations in Taiwan.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a Phoenix TV reporter was one of the only foreign journalists to embed with the Russian military.
