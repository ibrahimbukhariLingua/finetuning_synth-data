## History

The Ingram Content Group was formed, in 2009, when Ingram Lightning Group merged with Ingram Digital Group. Ingram Content Group's operating units are Ingram Book Company, Ingram International Inc., Ingram Library Services Inc., Ingram Publisher Services Inc., Ingram Periodicals Inc., Ingram Digital, Lightning Source Inc., Spring Arbor Distributors Inc., and Tennessee Book Company LLC.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

During 1999 and 2000, Ingram Industries negotiated a sale to Barnes & Noble which was ultimately withdrawn after pressure from independent bookstores and the American Booksellers Association.

In July 2006, Ingram Industries acquired VitalSource Technologies, Inc, which it later sold to Francisco Partners in April 2021.

In June 2014, the company, in conjunction with Hachette Book Group USA and Perseus Books Group, announced that Hachette would buy Perseus, and then sell that company's client services businesses to Ingram, with financial details undisclosed.

On April 4, 2016, John Ingram stepped down as CEO, and was succeeded by Shawn Morin.

In December 2018, it was reported that Ingram Content extended an offer to purchase book distributor Baker & Taylor's retail and wholesale business from their parent company, Follett. As a result, Ingram informed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of the proposed deal, and a preliminary investigation was started. The FTC contacted leading book retailers, Amazon, and major and independent book publishers to help determine the impact, if any, from the sale. This deal fell through and Baker & Taylor left the retail book wholesale market after divesting some of its entertainment product distribution to Ingram Entertainment in January 2019. Baker & Taylor's departure left Ingram Book Company as the only major book wholesaler to retail stores in the United States.
