## History

Originally founded in Nagoya in 1974, Daito built factories, warehouses and shops in the suburbs for landowners. From 1980, the company set up a mechanism to protect against the loss of rental payments for properties vacated early for those companies that paid membership fees.

From the late 1970s, Daito began to expand and in the early 1980s expanded to many regions of Japan: Osaka, Fukuoka, Yokohama, Sendai, and Shizuoka.

In 1992, the Productive Green Land Act made it possible to build rental housing in urban areas and Daito shifted its focus to residential property.

In 2006, Daito introduced the Lease Management Trust System when changes in laws required landlords to cover most of the costs of rehabilitating a property. Under this system, the company covered the costs of rehabilitation and repairs and leased the entire building under 30-year contracts.

In the following years, Daito expanded its business in property leasing and management, asset utilization and succession planning. Especially after the 2015 revision of the Inheritance Act, when property rental became an effective way to reduce inheritance tax.

On 1 March 2024, Daito Trust Construction, together with Mizuho Seicho Shien Fund 5 (a fund managed by Mizuho Capital Co.
