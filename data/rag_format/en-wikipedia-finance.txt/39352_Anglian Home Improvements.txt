# Anglian Home Improvements



**Anglian Windows Limited**, trading as **Anglian Home Improvements**, is a British home improvements firm. It was founded in 1966, and is headquartered in Norwich, England.


## History

The company was founded as Anglian Windows, in 1966 by George Williams when he opened a factory in Norwich. In 1969 the first showroom opened in Ipswich before the company expanded its factory a year later selling PVCu products. Over the next few decades, Anglian grew to become a market leader, fitting over half a million products each year.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1984, Anglian was acquired for £30 million by British Electric Traction. During the next few years, the company expanded its product range to include conservatories, doors and stained-glass overlay. The recession during the 1980s damaged Anglian's profits, which saw a management buyout in 1991. This change in management lead to financial success, and the company spent nearly ten years on the London Stock Exchange.

The company re-branded as Anglian Home Improvements in 1997. In 2001 the holding company Anglian Group was bought by investment group Alchemy Partners, who then sold to a consortium of banks in 2008. In 2002 it became a founding member of the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme (FENSA). In January 2010, Anglian Windows founder, George Williams, died following an illness.

In 2015, the investment group Alchemy Partners bought back ownership as Anglian Group's majority shareholder.

In March 2020, in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, Anglian suspended all communication with customers, going into total shutdown including all repair and customer services, leaving many customers with partially complete and unsafe works. During its hiatus, the company added an online supply only catalogue to their website in summer 2020. The company began taking new customer orders again in June 2020, although it did not start to complete the backlog of existing work until September 2020.


## Concern

In November 2012, the Information Commissioner's Office publicly listed Anglian Windows as one of a number of companies that it had concerns about, due to unsolicited telephone calls for marketing. The concerns were based on complaints. In response, Anglian Windows said that it took complaints seriously.

Following these concerns, Anglian became the first TPS Assured company, a scheme set up to combat the growing reputational threat of so-called 'nuisance calls' made by rogue businesses operating outside the law.


## Turnover

Financial Year ending March 2019, employing over 1500 people, Anglian's total turnover was £217 million.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

As part of its Corporate social responsibility (CSR), Anglian have been seen to support community sports throughout the UK and regional charities.
