## History

Vijaya Bank was established by a group of farmers led by A. B. Shetty on 23 October 1931 in Mangalore, Dakshina Kannada district of Princely State of Mysore (present-day Karnataka). Since it was established on day of Vijayadashami, it was named "Vijaya Bank".

During the economic chaos created out of the Great Depression of 1927–30, Shetty approached leading Bunt personalities to start a bank with the objective of extending credit facilities at a lower rate of interest to enable the farmers to cultivate their lands and prevent them from falling into the clutches of money lenders. Accordingly, Shetty involved 14 Bunts and established Vijaya Bank on 23 October 1931. In the beginning the bank had an authorised capital of ₹5 lakh and an issued capital of ₹2 lakh. The paid up capital was ₹8,670.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
