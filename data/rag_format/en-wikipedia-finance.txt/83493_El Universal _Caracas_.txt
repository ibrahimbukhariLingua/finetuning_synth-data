Its first headquarters were located in a house between the corners of Sociedad and San Francisco de Caracas, where Daniel Aramburu's printing press worked. The first issue, which came out that same day, was published on Marinoni machines of French origin. The editors of this first issue were Rafael Silva in the chronicle, Francisco López Moreno and Santiago Caldera in the distribution, Luis Correa who served as chronicler, Pedro Bocca as office manager, Luis Alberto Ascanio as depositor, Miguel Ángel Ibarra as a proofreader, and Federico Webber as press writer. The format of this first issue was broadsheet, and had four pages in six columns. Six months later, the newspaper moved to an old building located between Sociedad and Gradillas streets.

In January 1910, the first photographs of the newspaper were published, one by Juan Vicente Gómez and another of a troop in the Plaza Bolívar in Caracas, which Guerra Toro took. That same year, an electric blackboard indicated to the public the topics that would be reported the following day. The following year, a Duplex machine was acquired for editing, increasing its edition to eight pages.

On December 17, 1930, the first rotary printing press in the country was installed, Ludlow brand, with which the newspaper began to be printed, on the memorial day of the centenary of the death of Simón Bolívar.
