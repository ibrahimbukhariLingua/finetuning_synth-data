Avis Europe


# Avis Europe



**Avis Europe plc** is a United Kingdom-based company which holds the licence to operate the two main vehicle rental brands of Avis Budget Group (Avis Car Rental and Budget Rent a Car) in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as well as Asia in the case of Avis. In 2011 it was acquired by Avis Budget Group.


## History

The company was an operating division of Avis Rent a Car until 1986, when it was spun out and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The firm was then acquired by a consortium of Avis Group, General Motors and D'Ieteren in 1989 before being listed on the LSE once more in 1997. While Avis and GM sold their stakes in Avis Europe, D'Ieteren continued to hold a controlling 59.6% stake in the firm.

In 2003, shortly after Budget was acquired by Avis's then-parent Cendant, Avis Europe also took over the rights to that brand in its operating regions (except Asia).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
