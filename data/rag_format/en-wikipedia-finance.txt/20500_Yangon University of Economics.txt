Founded as the Section of Economics of Yangon University in 1924, the section became an independent university of higher learning in 1964. The University offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and diplomas, mostly in commerce, statistics and economics. It is also the best business school in the country, offering full-time, executive MBF, MHTM, MMM and MBA degrees.

The university serves over 1000 undergraduate and graduate students over its three Yangon area campuses: the main campus from Yangon University in Kamayut in the city and satellite campuses in Hlaing (also from Yangon University), and Ywarthargyi.


## History

The YUE began as Section of Economics under the Yangon University in 1924. The **Section of Economics** began offering commerce as a special subject in 1940, and courses in statistics in 1953. In 1955, a separate Commerce Department was established, and in 1956 a separate Statistics Department was established. In 1964 the institute became an independent tertiary institute with three academic departments and one separate research department. In 1987, the Research Department was transformed into the Department of Management Studies and another academic department, the Department of Applied Economics was created. The Institute now has five major academic departments and four supporting academic departments: Burmese, English, mathematics and geography.

It added not only a full-time MPA (2000), MDevS (2004) but also a full-time MBA program in 1995, an executive MBA (EMBA) program in 2002, and an online MBA program in 2007.
