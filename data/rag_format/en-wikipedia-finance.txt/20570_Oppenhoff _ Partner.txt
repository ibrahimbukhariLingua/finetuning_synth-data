# Oppenhoff & Partner



**Oppenhoff & Partner** is a German commercial law firm specialised in the provision of legal advice to entrepreneurs and enterprises operating internationally. It has its seat in Cologne, is an independent partnership and is not affiliated to any network or other alliance.


## History

The office Oppenhoff & Partner was founded in 1908 in Cologne under the name Becker, Ströhmer and Lang. Walter Oppenhoff joined the firm in 1930 as named partner, led it through the World War II, inter alia as the alien property custodian of Coca-Cola, and expanded the firm in the post-war years.

The following office partners Boden, Oppenhoff and Schneider have exerted a considerable influence on the German laws governing the legal profession. In 1989, they successfully fought for the right to set up nationwide partnerships before the Federal Court of Justice of Germany, resulting in the establishment of the partnership Oppenhoff & Rädler in the mid 1990s.

In the year 2001, the firm merged with the English commercial law firm Linklaters. Since January 2008 Oppenhoff & Partner has returned to being an independent partnership situated in Cologne, with about 150 employees, including 65 lawyers. In 2013, the firm expands to a second office in Frankfurt. Partners of the preceding partnership Oppenhoff & Rädler set up the Walter Oppenhoff Foundation in honour of its founding member of the same name.
