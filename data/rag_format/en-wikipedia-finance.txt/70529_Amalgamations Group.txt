## History

The Amalgamations Group was established by S. Anantharamakrishnan who during the early 1940s was a Director at Simpsons & Co.

In 1945, he took over the management and later consolidated several British owned companies with interests in plantation, engineering, trading and services. According to popular Chennai-based historian S. Muthiah, the successful takeover was the result of an overheard conversation at a Hotel Connemara.
