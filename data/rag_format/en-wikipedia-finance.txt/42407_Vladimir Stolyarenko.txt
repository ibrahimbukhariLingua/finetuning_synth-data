## Career

From 1990 to 1993, Stolyarenko headed the Russian office of the Paris based consulting and auditing firm *SECAFI* also spelled *Alpha-Secafi* or *Secafi Alpha SA*, which is a subsidiary of the December 1983 established *Alpha Group* (French: *Groupe Alpha*) owned by Pierre Ferracci.

Stolyarenko was senior vice president of the Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) branch of the bank JSB Imperial (Russian: АБ «Империал») from 1993 to 1998. Imperial focused on oil and natural gas supplies to East Germany and later to Germany including the oil-for-pipes program.

On 28 April 1992 using DM 50 million from a "frozen" VEB account, Tokobank gained an 80.6% stake in Ost-West Handelsbank after the shareholders of Ost-West Handelsbank transferred the stake to Tokobank which was the first privatization of a former sovzagranbank (Russian: Совзагранбанк).

Since 8 May 1998 Vladimir Stolyarenko headed for two consecutive months the temporary administration introduced by the Bank of Russia in “Tokobank” (Russian: Токобанк). The provisional administration took over the functions of operational management of the bank. In 1998, Tokobank owned a 28% stake in the German bank Ost-West Handelsbank.

After working in the bank, Stolyarenko focused on the implementation of investment projects and research activities. Stolyarenko holds Ph.D. in Economics and Doctorate in Law.

He owns a $10 million apartment at New York's Plaza Hotel, bought in 2007.


## Legal claims

In 2019 Stolyarenko got involved in the criminal case of FSB colonel Kirill Cherkalin. The former banker was charged with fraud and arrested in absentia (he had left Russia in 2012). Stolyarenko denied all charges against him. The court later completely excluded the mention of Stolyarenko's name from the descriptive and motivational part of its verdict, as unrelated to the case.

In the spring of 2023, the criminal case against Stolyarenko (and his colleague Alexander Bondarenko) was terminated due to the statute of limitations.
