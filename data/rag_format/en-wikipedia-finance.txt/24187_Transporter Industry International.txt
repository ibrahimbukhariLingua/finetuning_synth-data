# Transporter Industry International



**Transporter Industry International** (abbreviated TII, also known as *TII Group* and *KAMAG*) is a worldwide operating conglomerate of companies providing heavy-duty transport vehicles and related services. Its history goes back to Otto Rettenmaier [de]'s acquisition of Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik [de] in 1988. In 1995, Nicolas Industrie joined the group, followed by Kamag Transporttechnik [de] in 2004 and TII India, which is represented by the brand Tiiger, in 2015. Transporter Industry International is the global market leader and known for transports on behalf of NASA, for example.


## History

In 1988, Otto Rettenmaier acquired one of the oldest and internationally leading manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles. The German company (Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik) was experiencing economic difficulties. Rettenmaier had already been active as an entrepreneur: He expanded his parents' mill business to become the world market leader in the production of wood fibers (cellulose).

After the successful restructuring of Scheuerle Fahrzeugfabrik, Rettenmaier bought the French competitor Nicolas Industrie in 1995, which also produced heavy-duty vehicles. To create the legal and organizational conditions for further growth, a holding company called Transporter Industry International was established. This was also intended to illustrate the global market position. The subsidiaries themselves retained their regional character and continued to operate independently, but cooperated in sales, for example.

In 2004, Rettenmaier was given the opportunity for further expansion. Due to the insolvency of Kögel Fahrzeugwerke [de], the subsidiary (Kamag Transporttechnik) specialized in smaller industrial vehicles and modular transporters had to be sold. With the takeover and integration into the holding company, Rettenmaier completed the product range of Transporter Industry International.

Scheuerle, Nicolas, and Kamag developed joint products for high demanding projects. All three companies set world records in terms of the loads to be transported and in other areas. In 2015, Transporter Industry International acquired the civilian sector of the Indian trailer manufacturer Tratec, thus securing its first local presence outside Europe, with access to emerging markets in Asia; subsequently, the company was renamed.
