## History

M&C Saatchi Group started as an advertising agency in 1995, founded by Maurice & Charles Saatchi, Jeremy Sinclair, Bill Muirhead and David Kershaw, in a split from Saatchi & Saatchi. A number of Saatchi and Saatchi's London management and creative staff also joined. Some clients soon followed, including Gallaher Group, Mirror Newspapers, the retailer Dixons and after a competitive pitch, British Airways and its part subsidiary Qantas, as well as the Conservative Party, for whom they made the infamous New Labour, New Danger adverts. By early 1996, the network consisted of offices in London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney, New York and Auckland. In 2020, the group stated that it operated in 24 countries, with regional offices in London, New York, Milan, Cape Town, Sydney and Singapore.

In 2019, some accounting errors from previous financial years were discovered. Problems included the early recognition of revenue for projects not fully completed and the capitalising of assets which ought to have been expensed. The issues were brought to the attention of the PLC directors and an announcement was made that charges of £6.4M would be booked in the 2019 year relating to either 2018 or 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed as independent advisors to review and confirm findings. In December 2019, the Board announced the total charges would in fact be £11.6M. The company's original auditor KPMG resigned earlier in 2019.

It was reported that the agency's client, the Financial Conduct Authority – Britain's financial watchdog - issued a formal request for information to examine M&C's disclosure of the accounting problems which prompted the share price fall.

In January 2021, the founders of the agency stepped down and Moray MacLennan became the new CEO. In January 2021, M&C Saatchi Group hosted a virtual capital markets event for institutional investors and analysts, where they announced a new strategy and operating model. The new mantra 'We Navigate, Create and Lead Meaningful Change' was launched, described by MacLennan as a 'new chapter' for M&C Saatchi. Following this launch and announcement of positive financial results, the M&C Saatchi plc share price rallied, jumping from 90p to 150p in early March 2021.

On the 13th May 2024, Zaid Al-Qassab, previous CMO of Channel 4, joined as Global CEO.
