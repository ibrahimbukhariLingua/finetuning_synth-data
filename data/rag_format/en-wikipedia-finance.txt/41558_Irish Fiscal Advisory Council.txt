Irish Fiscal Advisory Council


# Irish Fiscal Advisory Council



**Irish Fiscal Advisory Council** (**Fiscal Council**; Irish: *Comhairle Chomhairleach Bhuiséadach na hÉireann*) is a non-departmental statutory body providing independent assessments and analysis of the Irish Government's fiscal stance, its economic and budgetary forecasts, and its compliance with fiscal rules. The Fiscal Council was created as part of a wider agenda of budgetary reform after the financial crisis.

The establishment of a fiscal council had been proposed domestically in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in November 2010. It also became a requirement of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial
Support for Ireland (December 2010). Its establishment follows moves to establish independent watchdogs internationally as a means of avoiding repeats of fiscal crises and to promote more transparency around the public finances.


## Purpose

The Fiscal Council was formed as part of a programme of reform of Ireland's "budgetary architecture" post the Irish economic crisis. It was established on an interim basis in July 2011, and legally constituted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 which was part of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland (and whose terms required the creation of a "budgetary advisory council to provide an independent assessment of Government forecasts").

The formation of the Fiscal Council was a response to the perceived failure of established Irish economic and Irish regulatory institutions to anticipate and warn over the consequences of the Irish credit bubble and/or to engage in the concerns that were being raised by various international monitors at the time (IMF and OECD) regarding Ireland's economic situation.

The Fiscal Council performs a similar role to the "Office for Budget Responsibility" in the United Kingdom (also formed after the financial crisis), and other equivalent members of the "Network of European Union Independent Fiscal Institutions" (which the Fiscal Council joined in September 2015).

It is structured as a council of five members (one chairperson) and a supporting analytical team of about seven.

The formal mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (per its website) is to:

* Assess and endorse the Irish Government's official macroeconomic forecasts.
* Assess the Irish Government's budgetary forecasts.
* Assess the broader fiscal stance of the Irish Government.
* Monitor compliance with legislated fiscal rules by the Irish Government.

The Fiscal Council has been well received by Irish financial commentators and its publications are widely covered in the Irish media.
