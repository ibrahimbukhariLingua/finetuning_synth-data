The Leader of Government Business is appointed by the President of South Africa and is responsible for:

* Overseeing the fulfillment of Cabinet's duties
* Ensuring the timely and correct handling of legislation initiated by Cabinet
* Leading the government's legislative program in Parliament
* Coordinating the government's business in Parliament
* Performing any other function provided for by the Joint Rules or a resolution of the National Assembly or the National Council of Provinces
