Subsequently, Parker started working as accountant in Nigeria, and Australia, where he became a lecturer at the University of Adelaide, and then a sub-dean at the University of Western Australia. In 1966 he returned to England, where he joined the faculty of the London School of Economics. He also lectured at INSEAD and at the University of Dundee before he was appointed Professor of Accounting at the University of Exeter in 1976.
