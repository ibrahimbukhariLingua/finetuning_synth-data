## Early life and education

Vaidyanathan was born in Chennai. As a child, he studied at Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan's Pathankot school. Subsequently, he chose to enroll in the National Defence Academy and took the Pilot Aptitude Test. As a result, he participated in the Services Selection Board interview, but his medical examination revealed his disqualification due to an eye-related problem.

Vaidyanathan enrolled in the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, but ran out of money to buy train tickets. His mathematics teacher then lent him 500 rupees to take a train to help him appear for an interview at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. Vaidyanathan searched for him for over 30 years but could not find him. Later, ICICI staff skip-traced his teacher in Agra and Vaidyanathan gifted him one lakh equity shares, amounting to ₹30 lakh (US$36,000) at the time of transfer.

Later, he attended the Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.


## Career

Vaidyanathan began his career at Citibank, and worked there from 1990 to 2000 in consumer banking. During 1999-2000, he transitioned to ICICI to lead their retail lending operations as they expanded beyond project lending. His responsibilities involved setting up the businesses, including all key functions related to strategy, team building, business relationships, credit policy, credit administration and risk management.
