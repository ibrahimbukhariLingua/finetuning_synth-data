## History


### Department of Commerce and Police

On September 6, 1901, the Philippine Commission established the Department of Commerce (and Police) of the Insular Government. William Cameron Forbes, future Governor-General of the Philippines, served as its commissioner from 1904 through 1908.


### Department of Commerce and Industry (DCI)

After World War II, President Manuel Roxas issued *Executive Order (EO) No. 94* on October 4, 1947, creating the Department of Commerce and Industry (DCI). Cornelio Balmaceda, a much sought-after professor of economics and director of the Bureau of Commerce (BOC), was appointed acting secretary of the newly created Department of Commerce and Industry.

Prior to *EO 94*, the Bureau of Commerce was tasked to develop and promote the country's trade and industry, under the overall supervision of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, as stipulated by *Act 4007* by the Philippine Legislature, enacted on December 5, 1932.

By 1972, the DCI had grown into a big organization with 10 regular bureaus and 22 agencies under its direct supervision. The DCI was mandated to promote, develop, expand, regulate and control of foreign and domestic trade and industry, as well as tourism.

To have closer supervision and to ensure more effective delivery of services, President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued *Presidential Decree (PD) 189* on May 11, 1973, creating the Department of Tourism to handle all tourism-related matters. A year later on June 21, 1974, Marcos issued *PD 488* creating the Department of Industry whose principal function was to promote and enhance the growth of the country's existing and thriving industries.

On June 2, 1975, the Department of Trade was created under *PD 721* to pursue efforts of the government toward strengthening the country's socio-economic development, particularly in the area of commercial activities. A key strategy of the new department was vigorous export promotion to generate much needed foreign exchange. A Bureau of Foreign Trade was also particularly established to push for domestic trade and marketing programs.

In the early 1980s, this goal of national economic development required the need to hew industrial promotion efforts with the expansion of Philippine trade overseas. This resulted in the creation of the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MOTI) on July 27, 1981, which took over the functions of the subsequently abolished Departments of Trade and of Industry.

Drastic changes followed after the 1986 EDSA Revolution. President Corazon Aquino signed *Executive Order No. 133* on February 27, 1987, effectively reorganizing the Ministry of Trade and Industry and renaming it the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). This was further strengthened by the issuance of *Executive Order 292* (Administrative Code of 1987). Other latter legislations have also amended its functions and structures.


### Malikhaing Pinoy Program

In 2023, Secretary Alfredo E. Pascual, launched the "Malikhaing Pinoy Program" (Creative Philippines Program) in the 2nd Philippine Creative Industries Summit on 7 March. The DBM funded the project which aims to promote the Bagong Pilipinas' Philippine creative industry.

In the implementation of the "Philippine Creative Industries Development Act" (Republic Act No. 11904), the DTI partnered with the FDCP per the MoU which launched the 2024 “Lunsod Lunsad” and “Boosting Competitive and Creative Cities” through the Malikhaing Pinoy Program.
