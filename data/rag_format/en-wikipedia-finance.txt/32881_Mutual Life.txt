Mutual Life


# Mutual Life



The **Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada** was a Canadian insurance company that existed from 1868 to 2002. The company's articles of incorporation received royal assent in the Parliament of Ontario on 19 December 1868 as the Ontario Mutual Life Assurance Company. In 1900, it changed its name to the Mutual Life Assurance Company of Canada.

At the end of the 20th century, Mutual Life was Canada's fourth largest insurance company. On 10 June 1999, shareholders voted to demutualise the company and to change its name to the Clarica Life Insurance Company. Clarica determined a valuation of CAD 865 million, and on 15 July 1999 made its initial public offering of 42.2 million shares valued at CAD 20.50 per. In December 2001, Sun Life made a CAD 7.1 billion offer to acquire Clarica. Shareholders voted in favour of the takeover on 6 March 2002, and the deal was completed on 29 May. Upon the purchase, Sun Life overtook Manulife to become Canada's largest insurance company. After the sale, Clarica was merged into the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, and the corporation was dissolved at the end of 2002. That year, Sun transferred the headquarters of its Canadian operations from Toronto to Waterloo, where they remain today.
