## Application For Schedule 1 Bank in Canada - Exchange Bank of Canada

In October 2012, CXI applied to the Minister of Finance in Canada for letters patent continuing its wholly owned subsidiary, Currency Exchange International of Canada Corp. as a bank under Canada's Bank Act. The subsidiary would carry on business in Canada under the name of Exchange Bank of Canada in English and Banque de change du Canada in French, and its head office would be located in Toronto.

As a bank, it is looking to provide a range of foreign currency and related products and services to banks, in the form of a "Banker's Bank".

In September 2016, Currency Exchange International of Canada Corp. was given the order to commence and carry on business as Exchange Bank of Canada (EBC), in English, and Banque de change du Canada, in French, and is now operating as a Canadian Schedule 1 bank. The order to continue as a federally regulated financial institution is made by Canada's Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) after the Letters Patent are issued by the Minister of Finance.
