## Ministry of Investment

Mohieldin was appointed Minister of Investment upon its establishment in 2004. The ministry was established with a mandate to reform the investment climate in Egypt, further develop non-bank financial services, and introduce a comprehensive Asset Management Program for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). He led a comprehensive structural and regulatory reform program to modernize and liberalize the Egyptian economy in those three critical areas – leveraging private investment for growth and job creation; enhancing access to non-bank financial services; and implementing a successful asset management program of public enterprises.

Private investment: through his major legislative and institutional reforms, there was a tangible impact on both domestic investments, as well as FDI inflows. Between 2004–05 and 2006–07, private sector investments grew at an average annual rate of 40% and FDI inflows increased from $2 billion in 2004 50 $13.2 billion in 2008. As a result of his leadership, Egypt was named Top Reformer for four years in the Doing Business Report and was the top regional recipient of foreign direct investment.

Financial services and corporate governance: Mohieldin has established a global reputation for effective and strategic management and built an outstanding record of results including creating an effective single regulator for the non-bank financial sector, the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA); building a stock market for small and medium-sized enterprises, the Nile Stock Exchange (NILEX); creating the first institute of directors in the Arab World; developing an environmental, social and governance index with Standard & Poor's for companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange (S&P/EGX ESG Index); developing the first Arabic Code of Conduct for corporate governance and introducing guidelines for corporate social responsibility; consolidating and liberalizing the insurance sector and enhancing its regulatory framework; and developing the mortgage finance market and launching Egypt's first liquidity facility for a mortgage refinance. These regulatory reform measures helped allow the non-bank financial services industry to accommodate new products as well as position Egypt as the regional center for financial services at the time.

Asset Management Program: By adopting a comprehensive asset management program, the Ministry of Investment, under the leadership of Mohieldin, eliminated the £E32 million debt of State-Owned Enterprises, and brought it to zero; its net assets went from negative to positive. By 2007/08, the portfolio was generating a profit of £E5.1 billion. The ministry also significantly enhanced the corporate governance of SOEs.
