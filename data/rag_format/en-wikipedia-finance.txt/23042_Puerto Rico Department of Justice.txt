The **Puerto Rico Department of Justice** (**PR DOJ**) (Spanish: *Departamento de Justicia de Puerto Rico*) is the Executive Department of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico responsible for the enforcement of the local law in the commonwealth and the administration of justice. The Department is equivalent to the State Bureau of Investigation in many US states. The Department is headed by the Secretary of Justice of Puerto Rico and has been in existence in one form or another since Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony. The current agency was created by the Constitution of Puerto Rico in 1952.

The Department, headquartered in a multi-story building in the Miramar sector of San Juan, includes a structure of District Attorneys to handle criminal caseload, as well as specialized divisions to handle antitrust cases, general civil cases, public integrity (corruption) and federal litigation, among others.
