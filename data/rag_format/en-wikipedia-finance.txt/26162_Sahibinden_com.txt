## History

In the late 1990s Internet entrepreneurship in Turkey began to evolve while classifieds were listed only in traditional media such as newspapers. Thus, in 1999 founder of sahibinden.com and Aksoy Group Vice Chairman Taner Aksoy came up with the idea to carry out the classifieds to Internet enabling sellers to post visually rich and detailed listings, on the other hand providing fast and easy classifieds search for buyers. As a result, sahibinden.com was launched in 2000, and initially contained 2700 classifieds.

As of April 2010, there are more than 1.500.000 listings in different categories like cars, mobile phones, real estate and shoes. In 2009, 3 regional offices are opened in Ankara, İzmir and Antalya major cities in Turkey.
