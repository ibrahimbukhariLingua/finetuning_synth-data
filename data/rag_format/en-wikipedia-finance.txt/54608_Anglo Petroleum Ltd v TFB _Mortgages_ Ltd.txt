Anglo Petroleum Ltd v TFB (Mortgages) Ltd


# Anglo Petroleum Ltd v TFB (Mortgages) Ltd



***Anglo Petroleum v TFB (Mortgages) Ltd*** [2008] 1 BCLC 185 is a UK company law case concerning financial assistance.


## Facts

A company in trouble, undergoing restructuring, undertook to pay back money after its acquisition. Repsol, the seller of shares, was only willing to sell if it received £15m. The company agreed to pay £15m to the parent, and the company’s shares were then sold for £1.


## Judgment

The court held this was not financial assistance, because the agreed payment merely reduced the shares’ value to £1, rather than assisting in the purchase of the shares.
