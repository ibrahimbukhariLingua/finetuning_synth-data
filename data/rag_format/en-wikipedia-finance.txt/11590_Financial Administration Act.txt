Financial Administration Act


# Financial Administration Act



The ***Financial Administration Act*** (French: *Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques*) ('The Act') is legislation enacted by the Parliament of Canada, governing financial administration of the government, public assets, the estimates process, the Department of Finance, the Treasury Board of Canada and Crown Corporations. The Government of Canada has described the Act as the "cornerstone of the legal framework for general financial management and accountability of public service organizations and Crown corporations."


## Legislative history


### 1951-52 version

The first version of the Act was moved as Bill 25 in 1951 by member of parliament and government house leader Alphonse Fournier on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Douglas Abbott during the 5th session of the 21st Canadian Parliament. According to Fournier, the intent was for the minister to introduce the legislation, but he was out of the country at the time, occupied with duties related to the then-nascent NATO. The bill followed a failed attempt at the same legislation in the fourth legislation that died on the order paper when parliament prorogued.

The legislation was intended as a consolidation of multiple pieces of existing legislation, including the Department of Finance and Treasury Board Act, acts related to Crown Corporations, and the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act which originated in 1878 and had a substantial update in 1931 but in the opinion of a legislator had no substantial updates since. The legislation was also characterized as highly technical Some remnants of the Department of Finance and Treasury Board Act remained after consolidation.

The Act had multiple stated objectives, with one heavily featured in debated being the regularization of the relationship between the government and Canadian Crown Corporations. However, the Act was also intended to update and consolidate the government's procedures related to public borrowing, debt management, the comptroller general, to provide general debt relief on all debts incurred to the government before 1940, changing accounting practices with regard to government inventory, regularizing debt forgiveness procedures for the future, and modernization of the Treasury Board.

Some changes may also have stemmed from recommendations made by the auditor general Robert Sellar, possibly made in private correspondence to a single member. One such recommendation seemed to be whether the auditor general should be permitted to serve as auditor for Crown Corporations.

The bill received both debate when notice was given for the motion for the bill to be read a first time, by Fournier, and debate at first reading, which contrasts with modern practice. The bill was read for a first time on November 22.

Some Crown Corporations were exempted from the Act, either deliberately or due to the fact crown corporations had not yet been incorporated.

One major innovation in this Act was the development of the modern estimates process statutorily centred in Treasury Board and its secretariat that was absent in the Act of 1869, which was formerly centered instead at the cabinet level. Inaccuracies in estimations offered by the government had led to a larger than expected surplus in 1952, an item criticized by opposition leader George Drew, instigating interest in a more accurate estimates to avoid overtaxation without parliamentary approval.

After debate the bill was read a second time and referred to the public accounts committee, despite it being characterized as not having substantial organizational bandwidth to conduct the study. The report of the committee was considered section by section and passed third reading on December 15, and after receiving Senate approval, received Royal Assent on December 21, but has been at time categorized as either the Financial Administration Act of 1951 or 1952, as it was proclaimed and entered into force on October 1, 1952.

Senate approval was without major incident, was sponsored by Senator The Honourable Wishart McLea Robertson, leader of the government in the Senate for first reading on December 17. The second reading was moved by Senator Salter Hayden, with short debate and passed, also on December 17, and referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. The committee considered the bill that night, and third reading was agreed to without amendment the following day.


### 1985 Act

The Financial Administration Act received a minor update and a redesignation as the 1985 Act under the Mulroney government in the 33rd Parliament, as a part of a larger omnibus change to the Income Tax Act, pension legislation, unemployment insurance legislation and gas revenue legislation. The Act received only a small change under Part VI of the legislation. At the same time that the bill was being amended, the Financial Administration Act was invoked as something that should have led to parliamentary oversight of the privatisation of de Havilland Canada, which the government rejected, and did not succeed.

It received a series of technical amendments in 1990 centered around accountability of Crown Corporations, and speed of government payments to vendors.

The Act has since seen multiple changes every calendar year from 2003 to 2023.

The Act provides that debts can only be incurred by the government when authorized by law, and may also only occur through the governor-in-council then authorizing the Minister of Finance to borrow the funds. It provides that the parliament should establish each year a maximum borrowing limit that the Minister of Finance may not exceed.

If the amount of financial gain was over five thousand dollars, they can be fined an amount equal to the financial gain, or in the case of bribery, up to three times the amount of the bribe. In general, due to duplicate provisions under the Criminal Code, actions are rarely taken to use this criminal authority under this act.


### Part X


#### Crown Corporations

The Act establishes the structure for Crown Corporations, which are owned by the Crown, and wholly-owned crown subsidiaries, which are owned by crown corporations. Each corporation is responsible to parliament through individual ministerial responsibility through their respective minister, who can issue directives which direct the action of the Crown Corporation, and which the Crown Corporation is obligated to carry out. Crown Corporations can be authorized by law to be considered an agent of the Crown, capable of entering into contracts on behalf of the government.

These corporations have limitations on disposing of assets, with many kinds requiring governor-in-council approval first. This also includes selling-off of shares or the entire corporation.

There are some Crown Corporations to which some of the Act does not apply, notably the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Bank of Canada.

Each Crown Corporation requires a chief executive, who sits on the Board of Directors. The Act also establishes the four-year maximum term of the other directors, which is renewable.The Board of Directors is responsible for managing the corporation and sit as fiduciaries appointed by the governor-in-council. Boards of directors can make by-laws for the corporation, which can be repealed or otherwise altered by the governor-in-council.

Corporations are permitted by the Act to borrow, with the permission of the Minister of Finance. If surpluses are recorded, they may be transmitted to the Receiver General and treated as governmental revenues.


#### Accounting and Auditing

Each corporation is required to maintain internal records and audits, as well as quarterly financial reports. There is also a requirement to have an external auditor for each crown corporation and subsidiary, and it is by default the Auditor General of Canada, unless the Auditor General waives their first right to appointment. There is also a requirement that the Boards of Directors to form an audit committee to receive and action the auditor's report.


### Part XI


#### Payment Discrepancies

Part XI, which deals with miscellaneous parts of the Act, deals with cases of minor amounts owing to the government, and permits the Receiver General to recover outstanding debts, or for debts to be waived with permission of a relevant minister.


## Regulation

The Act has over one hundred regulations and orders, with most of them being special purpose regulations. Notable general purpose regulations that engage with statutory language that invites their creation include those on debt write-offs, general crown corporation regulations, a regulation governing corporate plans, interest and administrative charges regulations, and others.


## Media coverage

The Act receives occasional media coverage due to its influence on government practices.

In some cases, it can be due to the practices of crown corporations and government's treatment of them. For example in 2022, a reclassification of the Trans Mountain Corporation, the crown corporation responsible for the Trans Mountain Pipeline, gave it more license to conduct borrowing without government oversight, which was criticized by the NDP opposition party. A similar move exempting the Canada Growth Fund from oversight was also criticized in 2022.

In some cases, controversy may be linked to borrowing. In 2020, as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government proposed spending and borrowing power without explicit parliamentary approval for a period of 21 months, a proposal which quickly was pushed back on and revised to only apply for only a few months.

Section 19 of the Act became the basis of a large class action suit against the government regarding the cost of processing immigration visas, as the fee was set higher than cost recovery without an authorization by the governor-in-council. The case was ongoing as of 2022.
