## 2008 election

At the age of 27, Montagano was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Congress in Indiana's 3rd congressional district (see map) in the 2008 U.S. Congressional elections. He was unable to unseat seven-term incumbent Representative Mark Souder, falling short by a margin of 43,384 votes. His campaign raised $854,429 in total contributions as one of the top funded challengers in the Country, but was outspent by Rep. Souder who raised $1,076,565.

Despite the outcome, Montagano gave Congressman Souder his toughest challenge for re-election in fourteen years in one of the Country’s most Republican Districts. According to Cook Political Report, the district has a Partisan Voter Index (PVI) of R+18, indicating a generic Republican outperforms a generic Democrat 68% to 32% (18% above 50%), a 36-point republican advantage. President George W. Bush carried the district in 2004 with 68% of the vote.

Montagano was considered by the Democratic Party to be one of the top 50 candidates in the Country, and was named to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s list of the top U.S. House of Representatives races in the Country, receiving Red-to-Blue designation.

He was endorsed and supported by U.S. Senator Evan Bayh, Indiana Governor Joe Kernan, a majority of Indiana’s Congressional Delegation (Congressmen Andre Carson, Pete Visclosky, Joe Donnelly, Baron Hill and Brad Ellsworth), and mayors in Indiana’s Third Congressional district (Mayors Tom Henry – Fort Wayne, Dick Moore - Elkhart, Alan Kauffman - Goshen, Dick Hickman - Angola, Jim Fleck - Columbia City, Steve Lueke – South Bend). He also generated the support of national politicians including, President Barack Obama, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, US House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and US House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, and former Majority Whip and President of NYU John Brademas and over 100 other members of congress. He was also endorsed by Esquire Magazine.

In the weeks before the election, state and national pundits predicted a very close finish, categorizing the race at “Toss Up” or “Leans Republican”, with polls at: 44% (Montagano) to 41% (Souder), 45% (Souder) and 40% (Montagano), and 50% (Souder) to 41% (Montagano). In the end, Montagano was unable to overcome the strong Republican tilt of the district, carrying only 40% of the vote, with Souder being reelected with 55%.
