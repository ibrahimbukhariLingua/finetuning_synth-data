Wrong way risk


# Wrong way risk



In the field of finance, a **wrong way risk** (**WWR**) occurs when credit exposure to a counterparty is negatively correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. In other words, the more a party gains on a trade, the more likely it is for the counterparty to default. It is a source of concerns for banks and regulators, as it increases the overall counterparty credit risk.

It is opposed to **right way risk** (**RWR**), which occurs when one party's payment obligations are positively correlated to the same party's credit worthiness and thus reduces the overall counterparty credit risk.


## Types


### Specific wrong way risk (SWWR)

Specific wrong way risk arises through poorly structured transactions or through factors that are specific to the counterparty, such as a rating downgrade or a litigation.
An example could be a company selling a put option on its own stock. If the stock suddenly loses value, the company's credit quality will decrease, while also increasing its liability to the owner of the put option.


### General wrong way risk (GWWR)

General wrong way risk (also known as **conjectural wrong way risk**) arises through macroeconomic factors that are not specifically affecting the counterparty, such as a shock on interest rates.

An example could be an interest rate swap between two parties, where Party A agrees to pay to Party B a fixed interest rate in exchange for a floating interest rate. If interest rates rise globally, Party A's exposure increases while the counterparty's likelihood of default increases (as it is now obligated to make larger interest payments).
