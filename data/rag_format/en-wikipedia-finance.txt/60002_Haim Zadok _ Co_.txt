## History

Haim Zadok & Co. was founded in 1958 by Haim Yosef Zadok, a prominent lawyer and former Labor minister. Zadok served as Israel's Minister of Justice, Minister of Industry and Trade, and Minister of Religion. In 1993, he was elected president of the Israel Press Council.

In 1989, the firm, with its founder representing it, argued to the Knesset Economic Committee that cigarette advertising does not encourage young people to start smoking.

In 1990, the firm represented Bank Leumi in a dispute with its former chairman and CEO, Ernest Japhet. The bank sought NIS 15 million in compensation for unusually lucrative personal contracts that Japhet had signed with senior executives. In 2000 the firm was appointed by the courts to act as trustee for the sale of United Steel Mills.

In 2001 the firm represented Time, Inc. in the case of *Sharon vs. Time Inc.*, in which Sharon contended that *Time* magazine libeled him in its 1983 cover story about the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre. In 2007 the firm represented Bank Hapoalim in litigation against Heftsiba, a bankrupt property developer.

Ilan Shavit-Stricks is Haim Zadok & Co.'s senior and managing partner. The firm's of counsel was Advocate Dan Meridor, a former Minister of Justice and Minister of Intelligence and Atomic Energy. It was announced in November 2009 that he and Shavit would face a disciplinary proceeding of the Israel Bar Association for writing an illegal fee contract with Arcadi Gaydamak.
