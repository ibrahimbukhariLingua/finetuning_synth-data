Bord Snip


# Bord Snip



The **Expenditure Review Committee** (more commonly known as **An Bord Snip**) was an advisory committee established by the Irish Government in 1987 to recommend cuts in state spending.


## Establishment

The committee was established by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the Minister for Finance Ray MacSharry. It was a three-man committee comprising two senior civil servants, Se√°n Cromien and Bob Curran, and a private sector economist, Colm McCarthy.


## Etymology

*An Bord Snip* was a colloquial, comic term for the body. It is a mix of Irish and English words, literally meaning "the snip board". Many state agencies in Ireland have the words *an bord* (meaning "the board") in their title, for example Bord Iascaigh Mhara (the Irish Sea-Fisheries Board); "snip" refers to the cost-cutting remit of the group. In 2008 another board with a similar remit was established, referred to as "An Bord Snip Nua". *Nua* is the Irish word for "new".
