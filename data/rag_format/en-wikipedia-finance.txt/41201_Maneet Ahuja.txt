In December 2012, Ahuja and CNBC colleague, Kate Kelly, made the first report that Bill Ackman, manager of Pershing Square Capital Management, had a short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells health care products, and considered their business model to be a pyramid scheme.
