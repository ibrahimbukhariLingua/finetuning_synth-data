## History

In 1999, Edelman launched StrategyOne, a market research firm that would live under its Daniel J. Edelman Inc. holding company. A year later, it launched the first instalment of the Edelman Trust Barometer.

StrategyOne acquired a research firm in 2011 called PluggedIN, which specialized in research online communities.

In 2012, StrategyOne was subsumed into a newly-launched research venture, Edelman Berland. The new venture took its name from leading industry figure Michael Berland, who was appointed as its CEO.

Upon Michael Berland leaving in 2016, the firm renamed itself Edelman Intelligence, under Antoine Harary's leadership. It announced in 2020 that it was changing its name to Edelman Data & Intelligence.
