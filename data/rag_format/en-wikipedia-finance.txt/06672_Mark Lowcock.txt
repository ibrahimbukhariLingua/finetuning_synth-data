### Career with the UN

As the under-secretary-general and emergency relief coordinator (USG/ERC), he was responsible for the oversight of all emergencies requiring United Nations humanitarian assistance. He also acted as the central focal point for governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental relief activities. The ERC also leads the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), a unique inter-agency forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making involving the key United Nations and non-United Nations humanitarian partners. In a country affected by a disaster or conflict, the ERC may appoint a humanitarian coordinator (HC) to ensure response efforts are well organized. The HC works with government, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and affected communities

In his role as the UN's humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock coordinated the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). The GHRP was the international community's primary fundraising vehicle to respond to the humanitarian impacts of the virus in low- and middle-income countries and support their efforts to fight it. Nearly 250 million acutely vulnerable people across 63 countries were covered by the updated GHRP with needs totaling $10.3 billion. Activity funded by the GHRP included the delivery of laboratory equipment to test for the virus, and treat those infected, the installation of handwashing stations in camps and settlements, public health information campaigns on how to prevent community transmission, the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line medical workers, training for support services around sexual violence and intimate partner violence, the delivery of food and nutrition programmes, and the creation of airbridges across Africa, Asia and Latin America for the movement of humanitarian workers and supplies.


## Publishing career

Lowcock has been a frequent media commentator on humanitarian issues. He has written opinion articles for the Washington Post, the Financial Times, the Telegraph, the Times, the Guardian, CNN and others. He has also published three books. In August 2020 Troubador Publishing announced the release in January 2021 of Lowcock's book *Ten Generations*, which they describe as "an extraordinary piece of social and family history". Gordon Brown praised the book as "... a great achievement ..... eminently readable".

Lowcock wrote about his time at the UN in a book, *Relief Chief: A Manifesto for Saving Lives in Dire Times*, published by the Center for Global Development on 17 May 2022. Rory Stewart described it as "A scrupulously honest, thoughtful testimony on what it takes to fight for effective humanitarian relief by one of the most distinguished international civil servants. Never preaching, avoiding jargon, alert to politics, nuance, and practicality, Lowcock draws strong, impressive, and wise conclusions on how the world could improve its response to the mounting tragedies which surround us."

In October 2024, his book, co-authored with Ranil Dissanayake, titled "The Rise and Fall of the Department for International Development," was published. It discusses Britain's international development policies from the late 1990s to the early 2020s.
