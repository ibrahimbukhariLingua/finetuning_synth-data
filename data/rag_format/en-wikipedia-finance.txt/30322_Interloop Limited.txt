## History

Interloop was established in 1992 as a B2B manufacturer of socks and leggings by brothers Musadaq Zulqarnain and Navid Fazil along with Tariq Rashid. After eight years, a second production unit was opened with 400 knitting machines installed.

In 2003, Interloop opened its first vertically integrated hosiery plant in Faisalabad in an effort to make its supply chain management more efficient.
In 2005, the company opened their second hosiery plant, and launched a yarn dying division a year later, also in Faisalabad.

The company was converted into public limited company on July 18, 2008 from being private limited.

In March 2019, Interloop raised more than 5 billion pkr through Pakistan's largest private sector IPO, placing it amongst the top 50 companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange by market capitalization.
