## History

SIG was founded in May 1987 by six entrepreneurs, including Arthur Dantchik and Jeff Yass, who met in the late 1970s at the State University of New York at Binghamton, where they gathered to play cards. The company was named after the Susquehanna River, which flows near their alma mater. By October 1988, the firm had 100 employees and was located above the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The company generated $30 million in annual revenue in its first year, having earned millions through put options it had purchased prior to the Black Monday stock market crash. Susquehanna's profits in the late 1990s often topped $1 billion. By then, the company was trading convertible bonds, commodity options, index options, and was a major exchange-traded fund market maker.

In 1996, SIG founded Heights Capital Management in San Francisco, which focuses on PIPE investments in healthcare and technology.

In 2005, SIG launched SIG China, its venture capital operation in China. As of 2022, the firm had invested in over 350 companies with over 70 exits.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2006, SIG launched Susquehanna Growth Equity, which invests in software and information services, and offers growth stage funding to companies operating in the U.S. and Israel. At this point, SIG had grown to over 12 offices throughout North America, Europe, and Asia.

The same year, the firm invested in Kuxun, a search engine company, which was sold three years later, in 2009, to Expedia.

SIG experienced a major downturn during the 2007–2008 financial crisis but rebounded quickly, benefitting from the federal government's bailout of the financial system.

The firm invested $5 million into ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, in 2012 when ByteDance was founded. As of 2020, its stake in ByteDance represented 15 percent of its fully-diluted capitalization table and was valued over $15 billion on paper.

In 2013, SIG acquired G1 Execution Services LLC (G1X) from E-Trade.

In 2014, SIG expanded its venture capital operations to Japan.

In 2017, SIG launched Susquehanna Private Capital, LLC, which focuses on buyouts of U.S. middle market companies in the aerospace, industrials, consumer, healthcare, and business and government services industries.

Also in 2017, SIG established Nellie Analytics, a Dublin-based sports betting company.

As of 2018, the firm traded about seven percent of U.S. ETF volume and more than $1.5 trillion in ETFs globally on an annual basis.

As of 2022, the firm had 14 offices worldwide.

SIG played a significant market maker role in the 2024 merger of Digital World Acquisition Corp. and Trump Media & Technology Group.

## Controversies and legal issues


### Allegations of front-running client accounts

In 2009, the California Public Employees' Retirement System led a class action lawsuit against SIG and other broker-dealers, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Van der Moolen, and others, for improperly executing trades for their dealer accounts ahead of their clients. The lawsuit reached a settlement in 2012, when the defendants, including SIG, agreed to a $18.5 million settlement.


### Allegations of spoofing stock

In 2022, Northwest Biotherapeutics claimed in a suit filed in a Manhattan federal court that SIG, Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, and other market making firms engaged in repeated spoofing that drove Northwest's share price downward. The case was dismissed in 2024.
