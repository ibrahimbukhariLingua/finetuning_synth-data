In January 1920, "National" added to name in response to Germania Life Insurance Company becoming "The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America" in 1918.

In 1936, NGL became a mutual company based on a decision by the Board of Directors and several years later, in 1948, the company reached their first $100 million of insurance force.
