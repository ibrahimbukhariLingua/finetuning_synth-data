Carey Business School


# Carey Business School



The **Johns Hopkins Carey Business School** (also **Carey Business School** or simply **Carey**) is the graduate business school of Johns Hopkins University, a private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. It was established in 2007 and offers full-time and part-time programs leading to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Science (MS) degrees.

The business school is named after James Carey (1751-1834), a relative of Johns Hopkins. In 2006, sixth-generation descendant William P. Carey, through the W. P. Carey Foundation, donated $50 million to the Johns Hopkins University, contributing to the establishment of Carey Business School.


## History

In 2007, the School of Professional Studies in Business and Education at Johns Hopkins University was split into two new schools, the Carey Business School and the School of Education. As one of nine schools within Johns Hopkins, the School of Professional Studies had featured the majority of the university's part-time academic programs to serve the educational needs of working professionals.

The establishment of Carey Business School was engendered by the announcement in 2006 of a $50 million gift by philanthropist William P. Carey to Johns Hopkins through his W. P. Carey Foundation, in order to create a business school at the university. To date, this is the largest gift ever made to Johns Hopkins University in support of business education. The school is named after William P. Carey's ancestor, James Carey (1751-1834), a Baltimore shipper in the 18th and 19th centuries, chairman of the Bank of Maryland, a member of the Baltimore City Council, and a relative of university founder Johns Hopkins. W. P. Carey Foundation has similarly contributed to the endowments of the W. P. Carey School of Business at the Arizona State University ($50 million pledge in 2003), the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law ($30 million donation in 2011), and the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School ($125 million gift in 2019).

Yash Gupta served as the inaugural dean of Carey Business School from 2008 to 2011. In 2010, after the recession ended, Carey Business School launched its full-time Global MBA program. In 2011, Carey Business School relocated to the Legg Mason Tower in Inner Harbor East, Baltimore. The business school was originally located on Charles Street.

Carey Business School previously offered an undergraduate program. In 2008, Carey phased out undergraduate freshman and sophomore courses and began offering only two upper-division (junior and senior years only) undergraduate programs, a Bachelor of Science in Business and Management and a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. Carey primarily targeted non-traditional and transfer undergraduate students. The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) program enrolled its last incoming class in fall 2016.

Bernard T. Ferrari served as dean from 2012 to 2019. In 2015, Carey began to offer online classes to serve working professionals and students based in other geographic regions. In 2017, Carey Business School earned accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

In 2019, Alexander Triantis was appointed as the third and current dean of Carey Business School. In 2019, Carey Business School redesigned its full-time Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, succeeding the previous flagship Global MBA program which operated from 2010 to 2019. The redesigned curriculum provides students with more intense experiential learning opportunities and includes courses focusing on artificial intelligence, health care, data analytics, technology, and innovation. The MBA achieved STEM designation in 2023.
