Taxeringskalendern


# Taxeringskalendern



***Taxeringskalendern*** (English: "the tax annual" or "the tax calendar") is the Swedish blanket term for the directory that contains public information on taxed income from work and capital of all natural persons 18 years of age or above in Sweden.

*Taxeringskalender* also includes the income of legal persons. Sweden and the Swedish Tax Agency maintain a high level of legal transparency regarding the material privacy of individual citizens, comparable to Norway and Finland.

In Sweden, the first **taxeringskalender** was published in 1905 (though the term was established as early as 1903; however, the dictionary *Svenska Akademiens ordbok* attests to the word's usage first in 1923). The first two publishers were AB Förenade Kalenderföretagen, owned by Albert Bonniers förlag, and Kalenderförlaget i Västerås AB. Until 2008, it also contained information on individual asset data, but since the wealth tax was revoked on January 1, 2007, this information is no longer published.

The information comes from the Swedish Tax Agency, which, in turn, gets its information from the tax return. All records are based on the previous year, meaning that 2020's **taxeringskalender** is based on tax returns from 2019, which in turn is based on the income from 2018. This may render the **taxeringskalender** outdated if the person in question has obtained another job or a pay increase. People who, for example, sold their house without buying a new one, such as in the case of moving into the house of a new spouse, may have a very high one-time income listed.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Today the **taxeringskalender** is published by Kalenderförlaget in Solna. It is divided by county and is represented by 23 separate editions. Later editions contain a Top-100 list of the country's and individual municipalities' largest earners. The average income (divided by age group) is available for Sweden as a whole as well as by each municipality. In 2016, a top list for limited companies was introduced.

Credit agencies have electronic versions of the **taxeringskalender** from the Swedish Tax Agency and disclose information for payment.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Principle of public access to official records

In Sweden, tax returns are covered by confidentiality according to Chapter 27 § 1 *Offentlighets- och sekretesslagen* (2009:400). According to § 6, however, confidentiality according to 1 and 3 §§ does not apply to decisions whereby tax or pensionable income is determined or a basis for determining the tax is established.ˢᵖᵉˡˡⁱⁿᵍ?ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
