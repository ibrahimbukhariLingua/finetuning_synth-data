## Work

As Chief Economist of the U.S. Census Bureau, Foster is “responsible for identifying gaps in our understanding of the dynamic and complex U.S. economy and then finding ways to fill these gaps by working with our talented staff and outside experts in researching and developing new data products and improving and enhancing existing data production.”

In her research, Foster uses Census microdata to research firm dynamics, productivity, and management practices. Foster and a team of other researchers proposed and established the Annual Survey of Entrepreneurs, first fielded in 2014. Foster was instrumental to the effort to have the Management and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) added as a supplement to the Annual Survey of Manufactures. She is one of the key Census Bureau members of the Collaborative Micro-Productivity Project, a joint project with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has created the public use dataset Dispersion Statistics on Productivity (DiSP)
