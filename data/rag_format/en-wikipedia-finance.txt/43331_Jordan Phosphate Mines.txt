# Jordan Phosphate Mines



**Jordan Phosphate Mines** (**JPMC**) is a mining company based in Amman, Jordan. The company operates 3 mining facilities in Jordan and a chemical manufacturing complex in Aqaba. The company is listed on the Amman Stock Exchange's ASE Weighted Index as "JOPH".


## Background

Jordan Phosphate Mines was founded in 1949.

In 1986, JPMC bought the Jordan Fertilizer Company. JPMC already controlled 25% of the fertilizing company before its full acquisition. Jordan Fertilizer was operating a chemical and fertilizer manufacturing complex in Aqaba, which became the property of JPMC.

In 2007, JPMC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO), India's largest fertilizer manufacturer. In 2013, the partnership was renewed for one year, committing JPMC to deliver 2 million tonnes of phosphate in a year.

In the first semester of 2014, JPMC recorded a net loss of $9.4 million, mainly due to lower commodity prices and higher fuel costs.

In April 2016, JPMC raised JD82.5 million. In February 2017, JPMC signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Bangladesh to provide the country with 270,000 metric tonnes of phosphate and phosphoric acid within 3 years for $280 million. In May 2018, IFFCO and Indian Potash Limited (IPL) bought a 37% share in JPMC from the Brunei Investment Agency for $130 million. 60% of JPMC's production was already exported to india by the time of this purchase.
