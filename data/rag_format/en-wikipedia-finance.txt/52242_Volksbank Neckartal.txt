Volksbank Neckartal


# Volksbank Neckartal



The **Volksbank Neckartal eG** is a German cooperative bank headquartered in Eberbach.


## History

In 1865 a small circle of liberal thinking Eberbacher citizens who were connected to the idea of self-help founded the Vorschussverein Eberbach (advance association) based on the model of the co-operative founding fathers Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch. Three years later, the Vorschussverein Neckargemünd was founded. Both advance associations are predecessor institutions of today's Volksbank Neckartal.

In 2001, Volksbank Eberbach-Hessisches Neckartal merged with Volksbank Neckargemünd-Meckesheim, which emerged from the merger of Volksbank Neckargemünd and Volksbank Meckesheim in 1998, to form Volksbank Neckartal. In 2009, the merger took place between Volksbank Neckartal and Volksbank Schwarzbachtal.
