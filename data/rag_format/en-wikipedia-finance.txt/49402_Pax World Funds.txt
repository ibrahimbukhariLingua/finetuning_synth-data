## History

Pax World launched the first socially responsible mutual fund in the United States in 1971.

The company was founded by Luther Tyson and Jack Corbett, both of whom had worked on peace, housing and employment issues for the United Methodist Church. Their vehicle, the first broadly diversified, publicly available mutual fund to use social as well as financial criteria in the investment decision-making process, was the Pax World Fund, predecessor of what is now the Pax World Balanced Fund.

In 2014, Pax World Management LLC and Ellevate Asset Management LLC, whose principal is Sallie Krawcheck, partnered to form Pax Ellevate Management. Pax Ellevate launched the Pax Ellevate Global Womenâ€™s Index Fund.

In 2018, Impax Asset Management Group plc acquired Pax World Management LLC, investment adviser to Pax World Funds.
