**Tony Michell** (born 3 December 1947) is a British businessman, entrepreneur, and pioneer for early Korean development. He has worked with the Korea Development Institute to create policies for the government since 1978. Michell is considered a prime reference point on DPRK issues, and has been featured regularly on Korean broadcasting networks and the BBC.


## Career

At the October 1974 general election Michell was the Liberal candidate in Kingston upon Hull West. He then founded a bookshop company whilst continuing to participate in community politics. Throughout this period, Michell worked as the assistant professor in economic history at the University of Hull.


### World Bank & Korea

After Michell gained his PhD, he relocated to Korea to perform his first government project. His assignment was for the Economic Planning Board (EPB) and Korea Development Institute (KDI) on 'Short and Long term Planning and Policy Analysis.' After a successful conclusion, he went on to draft a policy for the Regional Development Research Institute (RDRI) and Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in 1980.

His contributions to the Korean government soon attracted the attention of the World Bank. He worked on the following projects throughout 1980-1986:

* ILO – "Employment Creation: employment and industrialization and trade in Korea"
* World Bank – "Comprehensive Transport Policy Plan"
* World Bank – "Urban Transportation Studies"
* UNDP – Restructuring Fund: "Truck Regulation Policy"
* UN ESCAP – "Cross Border Joint Venture in Motor Manufacturing in Asia" (2001)

### Businesses

From 1985, Michell worked for The Economist on the project 'Economist Operation Research' which revolved around projects in six countries. He was then employed by Tetra Pak Korea as the Director of Promotion and Logistics.

In 1989, Michell established Euro-Asia Business Consultancy (EABC) in England. Branches were set up in Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Pyongyang (North Korea). Due to high volume in demand, the South Korean branch became Korea Associates Business Consultancy (KABC); it specifically catered to foreign companies wishing to do mergers/establish base in Korea.


## North Korea

Michell was responsible for the first wave of foreign investment in the 1990s as the Vice Chairman of Northern Development Consortium. He personally invested in a pharmaceutical project labelled the Pyongsu Joint Venture Company which produces modern medicine in North Korea.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Michell maintained friendly relations with the North, giving unbiased situation reports to the media and investors.


### Humanitarian Award

Michell persuaded a large pharmaceutical manufacturer that it could move large quantities of short dated stock from its warehouses across Asia directly to needy recipients without fear of exceeding their shelf life. This donation with a face value of several million pounds was quickly distributed to North Korea where they were instantly consumed by Koreans during the height of the late 1990s period of hardship.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In recognition of his humanitarian efforts to help the people of North Korea, Michell was awarded the Order of Friendship 2nd Class by the DPRK government.
