## Critical reception

Chuck Taylor from *Billboard* described the song as an "acoustic guitar-based pop tune that's at once intelligent, clever, and hooky enough to turn ships back to shore." He noted further that "this is mature pop from a budding artist who has plenty to say" and "it's got "hit" emblazoned on every note." In 2012, *Porcys* listed the song at number 14 in their ranking of "100 Singles 1990-1999".
