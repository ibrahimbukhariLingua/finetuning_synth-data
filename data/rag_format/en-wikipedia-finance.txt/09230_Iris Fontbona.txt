**Iris Balbina Fontbona González** (born 1942/1943) is a Chilean mining magnate, media proprietor, billionaire businesswoman, and the widow of Andrónico Luksic Abaroa, from whom she inherited Antofagasta PLC.

As of February 2025, *Forbes* estimated her net worth at US$25.8 billion. She is the wealthiest person in Chile, the third wealthiest in Latin America, and the ninth wealthiest woman worldwide in 2022 according to Forbes.


## Fortune

Fontbona acquired her wealth following the death of her husband, Andrónico Luksic Abaroa, in 2005 from cancer.

The bulk of her husband's business went to their three sons, Guillermo, Jean Paul and Andrónico. Jean Paul manages Antofagasta, Luksic Group's copper mining group and one of the largest mining companies in the world.


## Business

Fontbona and her family control Antofagasta, the Santiago-based mining company. Through the publicly traded company Quiñenco, they control Banco de Chile, Madeco, a copper products manufacturer, the country's largest brewer, CCU, and a shipping company, CSAV. CSAV is the world's 16th largest shipping company as measured by TEUs. In 2013, she controlled 65% of Antofagasta.

Following the death of her husband, business of her husband under her control, "Fontbona managed to make their family business grow and reach its new heights of success".

This included turning the business in the second biggest bank in Chile, the biggest brewer in the world, manager of the largest copper mines in the world and controlling the world's largest shipping company. Another one of her businesses is a pair of luxury hotel chains and a luxury resort in Croatia. One of her first major actions following her husband's death was to acquire a 70% stake in Chilean television station, Canal 13. Much of her power in the company appears to be indirect. Major business decisions impacting the company largely run by her son, Andrónico Luksic Craig, need to be approved of by Fontbona.
