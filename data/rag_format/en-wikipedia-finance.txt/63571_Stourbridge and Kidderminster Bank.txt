# Stourbridge and Kidderminster Bank



The **Stourbridge and Kidderminster Bank** was a bank that operated in England from 1834 until 1880 when it was taken over by the Birmingham Banking Company.


## History

The bank was established in April 1834 by the industrialist James Foster with an office in High Street, Stourbridge. The building had been Foster's residence before his move to Stourton Castle. Originally called "Park House", it became known as "Bank House" after its conversion into offices. The first manager, John Amery and first cashier, Samuel Nock had living quarters in the bank building itself. Amery had been recruited from the Birmingham branch of the Bank of England. On formation, the bank had paid-up capital of £34,000. James Foster remained as chairman until 1850.

In June 1834 a branch was opened at Kidderminster. In the same year it opened a branch in Bromsgrove and took over the business of Oldaker, Tomes and Chattaway in Stratford-on-Avon. The Bromsgrove branch was initially only open for 1 day per week, but in 1851, the company of Rufford Biggs failed, and the Stourbridge and Kidderminster obtained their premises at 93 High Street, Bromsgrove.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
