Unbundling


# Unbundling



**Unbundling** is the process of breaking up packages of products and services that were previously offered as a group, possibly even free. Unbundling has been called "the great disruptor".


## Etymology

"Unbundling" means the "process of breaking apart something into smaller parts". In the context of mergers and acquisitions, unbundling refers to the "process by which a large company with several different lines of business retains one or more core businesses and sells off the remaining assets, product/service lines, divisions or subsidiaries."


## Examples

* Massive open online courses are "part of a trend towards the unbundling of higher education" by providing access to recorded lectures, online tests, and digital documents as a complement to traditional classroom instruction. Online program management providers are also increasingly unbundling services in higher education, which some argue "reflects increasing sophistication—and capacity—of colleges and universities as they launch new online programs."
* Software unbundling Some IBM Computer software "products" were distributed "free" (no charge for the software itself, a common practice early in the industry). The term "Program Product" was used by IBM to denote that it is a chargeable item.
