Stocks & Bonds


# Stocks & Bonds



***Stocks & Bonds*** is an economic strategy game published by 3M in 1964. The game is a simulation of the American stock market in which players buy and trade fictitious stocks to become the richest by the end of the game. A video game adaptation titled *Computer Stocks & Bonds* was released by Avalon Hill in 1982.


## Gameplay

Each round, players buy and sell the bonds or shares of ten different corporations and collect earnings from the previous round. At the start of each round, a card is drawn to determine whether the market is "Bull" (increasing) or "Bear" (decreasing). The value of each companies' share-values is determined each round by rolling a pair of dice and looking up the corresponding price fluctuation in either the Bear or Bull price tables. When the price of a stock reaches $150 or higher, the holders of the stock receive a second share for each they hold, the value of which are then halved.

There are ten rounds and the player with the most money at the end is the winner.


## Reception

Eric Solomon reviewed *Stocks & Bonds* for Issue 43 of *Games & Puzzles* magazine, and criticized the game for its unoriginality and low realism. In *The Playboy Winner's Guide to Board Games,* Jon Freeman heavily compared the game to *The Stock Market Game,* preferring the fact that all transactions take place on paper but commenting that the rules can occasionally be ambiguous.
