## Advertising

Budget Direct's previous television advertisements depicted a couple called Michael and Michelle. The ads revolved around Michelle's mispronunciation of the word "Budget" whilst explaining the benefits of Budget Direct insurance to Michael who continually corrects her pronunciation. In August 2013 Budget Direct rebranded with an alien version of the shower ad with animated aliens instead of Michelle and Michael. This also included a revelation of a new brand positioning and logo created by Hulsbosch. In January 2014 it was reported that the brand had engaged 303Lowe with the release of new TV ads featuring a daredevil by the name of Captain Risky and tagline "We don't insure Captain Risky to keep prices low", to explain the brand's low to medium risk market positioning. In 2018 a new series of television advertisements were launched with a detective character called 'Sarge' (played by Hamish Clark). The advertisements feature Sarge and a sidekick tackling fantastical and science fiction-based mysteries with the tagline *Insurance Solved*.
