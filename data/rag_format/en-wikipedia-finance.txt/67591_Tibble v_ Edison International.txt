Tibble v. Edison International


# Tibble v. Edison International



***Tibble v. Edison International***, 575 U.S. 523 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that "because a fiduciary normally has a continuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones, a plaintiff may allege that a fiduciary breached a duty of prudence by failing to properly monitor investments and remove imprudent ones. Such a claim is timely as long it is filed within six years of the alleged breach of continuing duty."


## Opinion of the Court

Associate Justice Stephen Breyer authored the unanimous opinion of the Court.
