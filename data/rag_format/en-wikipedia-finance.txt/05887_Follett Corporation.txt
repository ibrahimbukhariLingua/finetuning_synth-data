## History

Follett Corporation was founded in 1873 when Charles M. Barnes opened a used book store in his Wheaton, Illinois, home. Three years later, Barnes moved his business, now named C. M. Barnes & Company, to Chicago where he opened a store at 23 LaSalle Street. Here, he sold new and used textbooks, stationery and school supplies.

Charles Wolcott Follett (1883–1952) joined the company in 1901 as a stock clerk. The following year, Charles Barnes retired and his son, William, became president. The company had now evolved into a wholesaler, selling used books throughout the Midwest and as far away as the Oklahoma Territory.

In 1908, the company was reorganized as C. M. Barnes–Wilcox Company when John Wilcox, William Barnes' father-in-law, became the company's primary shareholder. Four years later, in 1912, C. W. Follett became vice president and a shareholder of the company. In 1917, William Barnes sold his remaining interest in the company to John Wilcox. Later that year, Barnes moved to New York where he partnered with G. Clifford Noble and founded Barnes & Noble.

The following year, with Wilcox nearing retirement, C. W. Follett took over management of the company and it was once again renamed, this time as J. W. Wilcox & Follett Company.

John Wilcox died in 1923 and the following year, C. W. Follett and his wife, Edythe, purchased the company. During the next two years, C. W. Follett's three oldest sons—Robert Duncan (Bob), Garth and Dwight—joined the family business. C. W.'s youngest son, Laddie, who was still in grade school, joined the company in 1930.

In 1925, Dwight Follett founded the Follett Publishing Company. In 1930, R. D. Follett founded the Follett College Book Company and began wholesaling used textbooks to professors and college bookstores. The following year, R. D. established the company's first retail bookstore on a college campus outside of Chicago, and in 1940, Garth Follett created Follett Library Book Company.

Follett died in 1952 at the age of 70ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, Dwight Follett succeeded his father as chairman.

That same year, it joined Internet Systems in forming Library Systems & Services, a joint venture that provides library management services to public, academic and corporate libraries across the country. In addition, Follett purchased Book Wholesalers (BWI) – a distributor of children's books to public libraries. In 1998, to strengthen the company's ability to meet the needs of its customers, Follett aligned its various business units under three market groups – Higher Education, Elementary and High Schools and Libraries.

On April 1, 2014, Follett's PreK–12 businesses became one legal entity named Follett School Solutions, Inc. This allowed the company to leverage the content and technology capabilities of its previously separate businesses: Follett Educational Services, Follett Library Resources and Follett Software Company.
