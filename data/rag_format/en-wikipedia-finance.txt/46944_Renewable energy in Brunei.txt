Renewable energy in Brunei


# Renewable energy in Brunei



Only 0.05% of Brunei's power was generated using renewable energy, with the remaining 99.95% coming from fossil fuels. The nation established a 10% renewable energy target in the electricity generating mix by 2035 in 2014. When it comes to renewable energy, Brunei has yet to significantly advance and establish itself as a desirable location for investment. From 2020 to 2035, the percentage of renewables must rise by 0.66% year in order to reach the aim. To further the growth of renewable energy, particularly solar energy, which is more plentiful than wind energy, the nation still has to implement a regulatory framework.

Even though they only make up 0.55% of installed capacity at the moment, Brunei wants to increase the share of renewable energy in its generating mix to 30% by 2035. Other ambitious goals include developing and enacting a carbon pricing or tax mechanism by 2025 and assisting multinational oil and gas clients in meeting their net-zero commitments. The development of the nation's clean energy market and the satisfaction of corporate demand for renewable energy are anticipated to be aided by the implementation of the I-REC(E) certificate.


## Background

Brunei and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), two oil-rich nations, use oil and gas as a key source of energy and heavily rely on it for their economies. Their energy roadmaps, however, have also been affected by the global energy shift toward more sustainable energy generation. According to its Wawasan 2035, Brunei wants to deploy up to 10% more renewable energy by the year 2035, while the UAE wants to reach 50% of its energy mix from renewable sources by the year 2050. According to the Brunei Energy White Paper, the country pledges to renewable energy are mostly motivated by its worries about energy security. In order to realize its vision by 2035, the Bruneian government establishes three strategic goals.

The primary goal is to enhance oil's upstream and downstream systems. The second goal is to promote the growth of sustainable energy, and the third goal is to maximize economic growth in the energy sector. The Brunei government has pledged to enhance renewable energy, particularly solar PV, in order to assure the growth of sustainable energy. Brunei also intended to build the Temburong Smart City, which would mostly rely on solar energy and be dubbed the "Green Jewel of Brunei." However, Brunei has only put in 1.2 MW of solar as of now as a demonstration project. It's reasonable to assume that the implementation of renewable energy is still in its infancy. There are, however, particular actions Brunei might take to quicken this process and increase its involvement in sustainable energy in the ASEAN area.

Currently, oil income still account for 73% of Brunei's GDP. While oil output is at its highest, the country could begin devoting a portion of this to encourage RE and attract investment. This will enable Brunei to make a smooth transition to RE and lessen its reliance on the oil and gas industry. Brunei should be aware that the cost of renewable energy technology has been steadily falling over the past ten years, and the nation might profit from it if the appropriate renewable energy framework is put in place today. As an effort to further realise this, the Brunei Government has made a good start by restructuring the Ministry of Energy, Manpower and Industry (MEMI) since July 2018. Previously serving as the Energy and Industry Department at the Prime Minister’s Office (EIDPMO), the new ministry is mandated to foresee the country’s energy, industry and manpower as its core roles.
