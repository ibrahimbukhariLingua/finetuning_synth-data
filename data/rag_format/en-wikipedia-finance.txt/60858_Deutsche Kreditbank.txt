The bank is located in Berlin and its infrastructure consists of a small number of branches. The focus on a selected group of customers including retail clients, business clients, and public clients are part of the bank's corporate.


## History

Deutsche Kreditbank was founded on March 19, 1990 as the first private bank in East Germany, and was set up as a stock corporation. One of the founders was Edgar Most, the last vice president of the Staatsbank (State Bank of the GDR). The share capital was held by the Staatsbank of the GDR, the *Verband deutscher Konsumgenossenschaften*, the *Interhotels*, the nationally owned *Centrum Warenhaus*, and *VEB Synthesewerk Schwarzheide*. On 1 April 1990, the bank began operations in the GDR with an opening balance of 286.5 billion East German marks. From the onset, Deutsche Kreditbank covered a broad spectrum of services, from business to retail customers. In its closing balance on 30 June 1990, the bank's own funds amounted to 11 billion East German marks.

On June 21, 1990 the debits of the Staatsbank were endorsed on DKB, and DKB's shares that were owned by the Staatsbank were transferred to the Treuhandanstalt. In the following years, the Treuhandanstalt bought the remaining shares from the founding shareholders until the beginning of 1993, when it became the sole owner of the DKB.

The majority of the deposit-taking business (especially corporate and retail banking), as well as a number of branch buildings and locations, were taken over by Dresdner Bank and by Deutsche Bank in the course of the currency union, and ran under Dresdner Bank Kreditbank AG and Deutsche Bank Kreditbank AG until 1991. According to the report of the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Audit Office), the buyers received access to the branches, the customer base, and buildings of the GDR banks for preferential prices. Deutsche Bank subsequently took possession of shares of DKB including 112 branch offices for 310 million marks. A subsidiary of Dresdner Bank paid 87,3 million Deutsche marks for 41 properties, including buildings that were formerly owned by DKB. A subsidiary of Deutsche Bank bought 74 properties for 164,4 million Deutsche marks. The auditors of the Bundesrechnungshof considered these "unreasonable low purchase prices".

When the Treuhandanstalt was closed on December 31, 1994, DKB was briefly owned by the Federal Ministry of Finance until the bank was sold to BayernLB on January 31, 1995.


## Corporate structure

The bank runs 26 branch offices throughout Germany. The property subsidiary DKB Grund Gmbh is based in 15 of these locations.

On January 1, 2008 DKB took over the Miles & More-Credit Card which was previously issued by BayernLB in cooperation with Lufthansa.

At the end of March 2012 DKB Immobilien AG was sold to TAG Immobilien AG.

Since June 14, 2015 SKG Bank has no longer been an independent stock company, but a branch and brand of DKB.


## Issuer

DKB regularly issues its own bonds and covered bonds on the capital market. In 2016 the volume of the bonds on the market amounted to 10 billion Euro. The rating agency Moody's Corporation rated DKB's bonds Aaa, and its naked bonds A2. In 2016 DKB issued its first so-called Green Bond with a volume of 500 million Euro. This bond was positively rated by the sustainability rating agency oekom research (Second Party Opinion). In addition, the DKB Green Bond received a certification label from the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI).


## Service

The bank's best-known product is the Girokonto (account) DKB Cash. Other products and services on offer are private real estate financing, brokerage services, installment credits, and savings products.

The bank only runs a small number of ATMs but offers its customers free use of other ATMs. Since June 2016 the bank has charged fees for using ATMs in countries outside of the EU.

Since June 2014 DKB has collaborated with PayPal and offers its customers access to all their PayPal transactions via the DKB online banking portal.

DKB's focus is on the digitalization of banking. Since 2013 the bank has worked on this goal with respective service companies and fintechs such as Berlin-based FinReach for account changing services, Cringle for P2P-transactions via its smartphone app, and WebID Solutions for video identification procedures. The technology underlying the DKB banking app, with which customers can photograph, submit, and pay their bills, was designed by Gini.
