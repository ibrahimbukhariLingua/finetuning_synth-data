## History


### Origins

The company's origins date back to 1865, when a Limoges porcelain (in France's Limousin region) workshop was set up on the route to Lyon originally making porcelain dishes. In 1904, the company was taken over by Frédéric Legrand who gave his name to the company. In 1919, the company entered into a partnership with an artisan from Limoges, Jean Mondot, who had started a small factory in Exideuil making electric switches using porcelain and boxwood.

Manufacturing subsequently gradually diversified into electrical equipment. At that time, before the appearance of plastic, porcelain was the best available insulating material. In 1949, following a factory fire, the decision was made to exclusively concentrate on electrical wiring devices (switches and sockets). The company very quickly extended its range to cover protection products (fuse-holders and circuit breakers, etc.), cable management products (trunking and mini-trunking), emergency lighting, etc.

Since then, Legrand has made more than 100 targeted acquisitions becoming a large and diversified maker of electrical and digital building infrastructures and connected devices with more than 300,000 product items. As of 2021, it has bases in 90 countries and sales in 180 countries.

The exchange of shares having been carried out, Schneider was forced to resell all of them. The shares were sold to venture capitalists Wendel Investissement and KKR.
