# Global Aviation Holdings



**Global Aviation Holdings Inc.** (Global) was the parent company of World Airways, Inc. (World), and North American Airlines, Inc. (North American), headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia, US. Its airline holdings included World and North American along with ATA Airlines until the parent company renamed from Global Aero Logistics to Global Aviation Holdings. ATA, World, and North American all were Part 121 U.S.-certified air carriers providing customized air transportation services for major international passenger and cargo carriers, international freight forwarders, the U.S. military, international leisure tour operators, and international corporations.

On November 12, 2013, the company announced that it is once again filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, shut down World Airways, and sold the remaining assets of North American Airlines in 2014.

## Global Aviation Holdings circa 2008-2012

Global Aviation Holdings had combined revenues of more than $1 billion, 30 leased aircraft (most from GECAS and ILFC), and more than 2,200 employees.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Global Aviation Holdings provides services in the passenger, commercial passenger ad-hoc lease and wet lease charter, military-on-demand, and cargo charter ACMI markets through its two airline subsidiaries.

Among Global Aviation Holdings' significant competitors in passenger transportation, that specialize in AMC charter contracts and (ACMI) and charter markets, are Omni Air International and Ryan International Airlines. On the cargo side, Global Aviation Holdings operations performed by World Airways remain distant rivals to the vastly growing ABX Air's airline holdings operations and network which include the much smaller (ATI) Air Transport International and Capital Cargo International Airlines, at one time fierce competitors for similar contracts. North American flew to the African continent with a link up to Virgin Nigeria Airlines, but all scheduled passenger service was discontinued in May 2008 as a result of the 2007-2008 fuel price rises. Global Aviation Holdings had substantial fleet operations transiting through Atlanta ATL, New York (JFK), Baltimore Washington BWI, Dallas Ft. Worth DFW and Houston (IAH)ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ on a regular basis.


### Fleet

As of May 2013, Global Aviation Holdings had 14 wide-body transoceanic capable aircraft in its fleet:

**Global Aviation Holdings Fleet**
| Aircraft | Total | Passengers | | | Business | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B | C | Total |
| **North American Airlines Fleet** | | | | | | |
| Boeing 757-200 | 0 | 16 | 183 | 199 | Passenger |

Global Aviation Holdings was expected to receive some Airbus A330-200F aircraft from an order placed by parent company MatlinPatterson prior to the closing of ATA Airlines. After the Boeing 757 was withdrawn from North American Airlines service, Global Aviation Holdings and North American Airlines became one of a small number airlines to operate only wide-body aircraft, much like its primary competitor Omni Air International, which too has no narrow-body aircraft. According to the referenced article in Businessweek, MatlinPatterson withdrew its Airbus order to resupply the Global fleet with newer technology widebody aircraft.


### Destinations

As of May 2008, Global Aviation Holdings subsidiaries North American Airlines and World Airways did not offer any scheduled service. They operated flights into more than 120 countries in 2009.
