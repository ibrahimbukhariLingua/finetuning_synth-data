## Business career

Stan Berk, a former hedge fund manager who hired Nevo in the 1980s after they met at a Los Angeles gym, said Nevo worked for him from 1985 to 1988, and then "just disappeared." After a certain time period, they met again, and "Nevo had befriended billionaires and media titans.

According to an anonymous business associate of Nevo, with an inheritance of around $10 million, Nevo set about investing and networking. *The New York Times* reported that Nevo "opened trading accounts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as Allen & Co., which eventually won him an invitation to Sun Valley... Through diligence and hard work, the right contacts and a lot of the right trades during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, he turned his inheritance into a sizable fortune ... Later on, Nevo began sprinkling money around in private companies, many of which were new media ventures."

His venture capital firm, NV Investments, invests in technology companies worldwide, and is said to have been an early backer of The Weinstein Company, and the largest individual shareholder in Time Warner.


## Personal life and reputation

Nevo is said to be averse to publicity: He has consistently refused requests for interviews, and was referred to by friends as an "international man of mystery."

In July 2008, Nevo said that long-running rumors of an engagement to Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi were true. The couple separated in 2010.
