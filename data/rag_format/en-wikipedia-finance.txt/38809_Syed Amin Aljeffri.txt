## Ideas

Syed Amin Aljeffri's general idea is to internationalise the Malays rather than the Malaynise the internationals in respect of professional services. As such, he considers the various companies in the Aljeffri Group as role models for other Malaysian companies, capable in providing complete and integrated corporate and management services. For four years he published a column for the Malay newspaper Utusan Malaysia, expressing his views and opinions on the business situations in Malaysia and is author of a book on management in Bahasa Malaysia with the title *Sekilas pandang: gaya pengurusan masa kini* (*At a glance: contemporary management style*).
