Vertcoin


# Vertcoin



**Vertcoin** (Abbreviation: **VTC**) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in early 2014, that focuses on decentralization. Vertcoin uses a proof-of-work mechanism to issue new coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate transactions. Vertcoin is designed to be mined via graphics cards instead of through ASICs.


## History

Vertcoin aims to be decentralized by being difficult to mine using dedicated processors, known as ASICs. Vertcoin is open source and has a 2.5-minute block time.

*NBC News's* Ben Popken said in 2018 that Vertcoin had received significant attention on Reddit due to it being impervious to ASICs which are used to mine bitcoin. *TechRadar's* Jonas DeMuro wrote in February 2018 that Vertcoin was comparatively popular due to a lack of friction for new users, as well as an active social media presence.

From October through December 2018, Vertcoin suffered from 51% attacks. In response, Vertcoin changed to a different proof-of-work algorithm before suffering from another 51% attack on DecemberÂ 1, 2019.

A December 2018 paper published in *The Transactions of the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers* said that "because [Vertcoin] is not a very popular blockchain, the difficulty adjustment algorithm is very sensitive to hash rate change, making it an easy target to timestamp spoofing and cherry-picking attack."
