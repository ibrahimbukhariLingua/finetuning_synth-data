**JD Health** (**JDH**; Chinese: 京东健康; pinyin: *Jīngdōng Jiànkāng*) is a Chinese company listed in Hong Kong that focuses on providing digital health services and resources. It is currently the healthcare unit of the JD.com (JD).


## History

JDH was founded in 2014 when the healthcare business of JD started operating as a stand-alone business unit. Hillhouse Investment was one of the investors that funded JDH.

In August 2020, JDH started a family doctor division offering services for families up to eight people. The whole family would get access to 24-hour online consultation services provided by general practitioners. However it never managed to be profitable and in May 2024, JDH terminated the division. Doctors working in public hospitals were not willing to be involved with the scheme which put strain on the division.

In December 2020, JDH held its initial public offering (IPO) and became a publicly listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The IPO raised US$3.5 billion and was the second largest offering in Hong Kong that year after its parent JD held a secondary listing earlier in June. On its trading debut, JDH shares surged 75% due to heavy demand from investors. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, patient fears over visiting hospitals caused online consultations to jump in early 2020. JDH hosted over 100,000 online consultations a day with a peak of 150,000 during the height of the pandemic.

In June 2023, JDH was added as a constituent to the Hang Seng Index.
