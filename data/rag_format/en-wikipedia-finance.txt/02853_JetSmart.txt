# JetSmart



**JetSMART Airlines SpA**, stylized as **JetSMART**, is a Chilean ultra low-cost carrier controlled by US investment fund Indigo Partners, which also controls low-cost carriers like Frontier Airlines, Mexico's Volaris and Hungary's Wizz Air. JetSmart's primary base of operations is Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport, servicing Santiago, Chile. It also owns and manages JetSmart Argentina, an Argentine subsidiary with a base at Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The airline commenced scheduled operations on 25 July 2017 with a service from Santiago to Calama. Its CEO and founder is Estuardo Ortiz Porras.


## History

JetSMART requested an air operator's certificate (AOC) on 26 January 2017, and received its authorization in June 2017. Initially, the airline operated three Airbus A320-200 aircraft, but has since taken delivery of Airbus A320neo aircraft. Initially flying only domestic routes, JetSMART has expanded its presence in the South American market, setting up JetSMART Argentina to access further traffic rights to the country.

On 4 December 2019, JetSmart acquired Norwegian Air Argentina and took over its operations, staff, and license with immediate effect, with plans to merge the airline with JetSMART Argentina. Following the acquisition, it was to operate both from Aeroparque Jorge Newbery and El Palomar Airport in the Buenos Aires area. As Norwegian's Boeing 737 aircraft were not part of the transaction, JetSmart planned to replace them with the airline's own Airbus A320 family aircraft.

On 29 July 2021, American Airlines announced a minority investment in JetSMART, along with agreements to allow members of American Airlines' AAdvantage loyalty program to earn miles when flying on JetSMART.

On 17 March 2023, JetSMART signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to purchase Ultra Air,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and is proceeding with certifying JetSmart as an aircraft operator in Colombia.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 16 June 2022, JetSMART commenced domestic operations in Peru, marking its expansion into a new market.
