Iron and Steel Act 1967


# Iron and Steel Act 1967



The **Iron and Steel Act 1967** (c. 17) was an act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, which regulated corporate governance in the iron and steel industries. It required that employees had voting rights for the board of directors.


## Contents

Schedule 4, Part V, stated that the corporation was required to participate in discussions with the workforce. Under this provision, worker directors were introduced in 1969.


## Background

The Iron and Steel Act 1949 had been enacted by the post-war Labour government to nationalized elements of the British iron and steel industry. It established the Iron and Steel Corporation to acquire certain companies.

Nationalisation of iron and steel production had been strongly opposed by the Conservative opposition. On returning to power in October 1951 they planned to denationalise and return the industry to the private sector. This policy was enacted through the Iron and Steel Act 1953 which repealed the Iron and Steel Act 1949 and dissolved the Iron and Steel Corporation.

The 1953 act remained in force until the Labour government re-nationalised the iron and steel industry in 1967 through the Iron and Steel Act 1967.
