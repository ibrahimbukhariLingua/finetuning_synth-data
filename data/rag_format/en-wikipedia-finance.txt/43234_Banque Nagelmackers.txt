## History

Nagelmackers was founded in 1747 in Liège by Pierre Nagelmackers (1705-1780) and developed by his son Gérard Nagelmackers (1731-1798). In 1810, it purchased a building on Place de Louvain 12 in Brussels, which it had rebuilt in 1870 on a design by architect Antoine Trappeniers [fr] and eventually became its head office. The Nagelmackers family was instrumental in promoting the Liège International Exposition in 1905. In 1910, it was restructured into a partnership French: *société en commandite simple* under the name *Nagelmackers Fils & Cie*. In 1935, financier Paul de Launoit [nl] purchased shares in the bank from several members of the Nagelmackers family. It was rebranded *Banque Nagelmackers 1747* in the 1970s, with reference to the date of its founding. By the late 1980s, it still kept its registered office (French: *siège social*) in Liège (Place de la Cathédrale 18), even though its main center of operations was in Brussels (Place de Louvain 12) with a third main seat in Namur (Rue des Dames Blanches 24).

After 243 years in independent operation, Nagelmackers went into several successive changes of ownership. In 1990, its banking business was acquired by Banque Nationale de Paris. In 1994, BNP in turn sold it to Belgian insurer P&V Verzekeringen [nl]. In 2001, P&V sold it to Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd, which in 2005 replaced the Nagelmackers brand with Delta Lloyd Bank. Also in 2005, Delta Lloyd sold the bank's operations in Luxembourg to Banque Degroof. In December 2014, Delta Lloyd announced the sale of its banking arm to Anbang, which closed the transaction a few months later and revived the Nagelmackers brand in October 2015. In 2022, amid a downsizing program, Banque Nagelmackers moved to a new head office on Rue Montoyer 14 in Brussels.


## Operations

As of mid-2021, Nagelmackers had 22 branches and 41 independent agents.
