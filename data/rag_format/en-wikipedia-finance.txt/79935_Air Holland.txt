**Air Holland Charter B.V.** was an airline based in the Netherlands.

The airline was headquartered in Oude Meer, Haarlemmermeer.


## History

Air Holland was founded in 1984 by John Block. It took a while for the airline to gain its operating certificate after KLM and Transavia Airlines attempted to stop the airline from getting it. In the early 1990s, Transavia Airlines attempted to purchase Air Holland but they were unsuccessful.

In 1991, Air Holland had to temporarily suspend all operations due to financial difficulties and a loss of DFL 30 million for the end of 1990. On 20 December 1991 Air Holland took to the skies again under A.R. Marx's management.

On 20 February 2004 Air Holland suspended its operations again. Its operations, flights, and aircraft were taken over by HollandExel from the Amsterdam businessman Erik de Vlieger. On 25 March 2004 the airline ceased operations due to financial difficulties.
