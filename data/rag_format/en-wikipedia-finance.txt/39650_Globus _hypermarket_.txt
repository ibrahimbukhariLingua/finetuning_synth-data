# Globus (hypermarket)



The **Globus Group**, led by **Globus Holding** (*Globus Holding GmbH & Co. KG*), branded as **Globus**, is a German retail company based in Sankt Wendel, Saarland (Germany). The Globus Holding includes the Globus hypermarkets in Germany (known as *Globus Markthallen*), Russia and the Czech Republic (known as *Globus Hypermarkets*), as well as the Globus DIY stores (known as *Globus Baumarkt*).


## History

In 1828, Franz Bruch (1801–1865) opened a grocery store under his own name in Sankt Wendel, a town in northeastern Saarland, Germany. The company management passed to his son Joseph Adam Bruch (1837–1905) in 1865. Joseph Karl Bruch (1873–1949), the founder's grandson, took over from his father in 1905. Since then, the company has developed from being a retailer only and expanded into wholesale. On 1 February 1949, Joseph died and his two sons, Franz-Josef and Dr Walter Bruch (1913–1999), took over the company. In the 1950s, the shopping behaviour of consumers changed, and self-service made its way into the retail trade. Walter and Franz Josef Bruch began to restructure the company. It delevoped into a Cash and carry market. In 1953 the company opened its first self-service grocery at its headquarters under the name "A. Backhaus KG".

The company grew further with the opening of a consumer market in Einöd in 1966. That store is regarded as the forerunner of the later Globus hypermarkets. The following years were characterized by further openings and expansion, making Globus one of the largest food retailers in Germany today.

After German reunification, Globus opened its first store in eastern Germany. With the opening of the first hypermarket in the Czech Republic in 1996, Globus took the first step towards expansion outside Germany. Followed by the opening of the first hypermarket in Russia in 2006.

In 2005, Globus opened its first master bakeries in some hypermarkets. In addition, there are specialist butchers and often restaurants. Fresh counters for sushi, cheese and fish complete the offer. Some locations also have petrol stations and car washes.

On 1 July 2020, Thomas Bruch handed over the management of Globus Holding to his son Matthias Bruch.

In August 2020, Globus hypermarkets joined the RTG (Retail Trade Group) retail cooperation, currently one of the largest retail cooperations in Germany. At the end of 2020, the Federal Cartel Office Globus approved the takeover of up to 24 Real stores. In 2021, the first three of 16 Real markets in Braunschweig, Krefeld and Essen became part of Globus. Ten further former Real locations were converted and integrated into the company in 2022, followed by the last three location takeovers in 2023: Wesel, Siegen and Hamburg-Lurup.

As part of a revision of the concept and appearance of the company's stores, they were renamed Markthallen in January 2022. At the same time, Globus SB-Warenhaus Holding changed its name to Globus Markthallen Holding.


## DIY stores

In 1982, Erich Huwer initiated the first Globus DIY store in Saarbrücken, Germany and subsequently built up the company's independent DIY division. Independent DIY stores followed in Zweibrücken in 1986 and Regensburg in 1988. In 1990, expansion into eastern Germany began with the opening of a DIY store in Ilmenau.

In 1987, the activities were merged into Globus Baumarkt Holding GmbH & Co. KG, and since 2003 the company has been known as Globus Fachmärkte GmbH & Co. KG. Its business is centred on DIY, home improvement and garden supplies.

In July 2007, Globus Baumarkt acquired 33 Hela large-scale DIY stores from the Distributa Group, 31 of them in Germany and two in Luxembourg. In December 2013, Globus Baumarkt announced the takeover of eleven locations of the insolvent DIY chain Max Bahr.

In January 2020, Timo Huwer, who had already been part of the management of Globus Fachmärkte since 2012, took over the position of his father Erich Huwer as spokesman of the management board.

Despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Globus Group continues operations in Russia, which has drawn criticism. Despite the public pressure, the managing director Matthias Bruch wants to continue the business in Russia for financial reasons.
