Amirsham Abdul Aziz


# Amirsham Abdul Aziz



Tan Sri **Amirsham bin Abdul Aziz** (Jawi: أميرشام بن عبدالعزيز) is the former president and chief executive officer of Maybank. His parents A. Aziz Podo and Marsinah Djamil, migrated from Silungkang, West Sumatra. He was the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of the Economic Planning Unit. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's move in appointing him as a minister was seen as an attempt in including specialists in the fields of economics and law to help stimulate the Malaysian economy.

Amirsham's credentials have been exemplary since starting his career in Maybank in 1977. In 1994, he became the Maybank's managing director – taking over from Tan Sri Ahmad Don, who became Bank Negara's governor. Amirsham subsequently became president and CEO in 2002.

On 18 March 2008, he was sworn in as senator at Dewan Negara, his first foray into politics.
