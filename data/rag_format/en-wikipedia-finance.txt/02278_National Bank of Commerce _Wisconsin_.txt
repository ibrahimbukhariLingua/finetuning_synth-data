## Company History

NBC was established in February 1934 as the Union National Bank of Superior. The bank was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) on April 23, 1934.

In 1940, the company was renamed as National Bank of Commerce.

In September 1972, National Bank of Commerce acquired Poplar State Bank, establishing new branches in Poplar and Solon Springs, Wisconsin.

In 1998, the bank reorganized its operations. The company also established NATCOM Bancshares Inc., as NBC's parent holding company.

In the year 2000, National Bank of Commerce opened its first location outside of Wisconsin, in Duluth, MN.

In June 2008, NBC purchased Superior Bancorp, with $90 million in assets and two branches in Superior. The deal gave the bank $540 million in assets and a 60 percent share of Douglas County, Wisconsin deposits. NBC also acquired Community Bank in November 2008.

In December 2017, NATCOM Bancshares, Inc., NBC's holding company, obtained federal permission to buy 49% of the voting shares of Republic Bank, owned by Republic Bancshares Inc. NBC subsequently received permission to purchase the remaining shares of Republic Bank in July 2019. The merger was completed in December 2019. Following the acquisition, NBC operated 10 branches throughout northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin, including four branches previously owned by Republic Bank. The former Republic Bank branches located in West Duluth and Hermantown, MN, were closed.

In 2022, NBC acquired the former City Hall building located at 1409 Hammond Ave, currently known as the Superior City Center. The additional space will be used for NBC's information technology (IT) offices, lending support services and other banking operations.
