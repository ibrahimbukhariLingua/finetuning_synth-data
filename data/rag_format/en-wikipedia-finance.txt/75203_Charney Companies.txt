## History

After working as a project executive at Two Trees Management for eight years, Sam Charney founded the firm in 2013.

In 2015, Charney Co. developed its first project, The Jackson Condominium, on 47th Avenue in Long Island City. The 11-story development is located around the corner of MoMA PS1 and features a lobby mosaic designed by Tom Fruin.

In March 2016, Charney Companies purchased the site of the Dime Savings Bank of Williamsburg, Brooklyn for $80 million. The firm later announced that it planned to fully restore the 112-year-old neoclassical landmark bank and also construct a 23-story tall residential, office and retail tower behind the bank. The project was completed, and leasing began in 2020. Charney collaborated with Tom Fruin and Swoon to commission lobby art work and exterior murals for the Dime Savings Bank project. The Dime is also home to the largest publicly accessible EV charging hub in New York, run by Revel.

The firm purchased 585 Union Street in January 2020. Charney Co. then purchased 251 Douglass St. in April 2020 for $22.5 million, with the firm later receiving financing from Barings LLC to expand the site. Construction broke ground for the 15-story Douglass St. building in November 2023.

The Green House, a 12-story residential building located in Long Island City, Queens, completed construction in January 2023. Designed by Studio V Architecture and financed by Santander Bank, Green House features three art murals by FAILE as well as an interactive light installation by Jen Lewin.

In May 2023, Charney Co. broke ground on 310 and 340 Nevins Street, a two-building residential project in Gowanus, Brooklyn. Plans for the 600,000 square-foot complex include: 654 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and a public waterfront esplanade designed by James Corner field opps.

585 Union Street, a nine-story mixed-use building designed by Fogarty Finger Architects, topped out in November 2023. Managed by Charney Co., the development is part of the larger Gowanus Wharf campus, which also includes the Douglass and Nevins properties.

In March 2024, the firm acquired 99 Claremont in Morningside Heights, with plans to convert the property into off-campus student housing for Columbia University.
