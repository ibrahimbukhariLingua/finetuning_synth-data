Conventionsthaler


# Conventionsthaler



The ***Conventionstaler*** or ***Konventionstaler*** ("Convention *thaler*"), was a standard silver coin in the Austrian Empire and the southern German states of the Holy Roman Empire from the mid-18th to early 19th-centuries. Its most famous example is the Maria Theresa thaler which is still minted today. The ***Conventionsgulden*** was equivalent to a 1⁄2 *Conventionsthaler*.


## History

The Austrian Empire introduced the Convention currency standard in 1754 to replace the Leipzig standard of 1690, after a drop in the gold–silver price ratio from 15 to 14.5 in the 1730s unleashed a flood of cheaper *thalers* defined in gold. The Leipzig standard defined the North German thaler currency unit at 3⁄4 the *Reichsthaler* specie of 25.984 g, or 19.488 g fine silver. In contrast, in 1741 the gold Friedrich d'or pistole of 6.05 g fine gold was issued for 5 *thalers*. This resulted in a cheaper Thaler Gold worth 1.21 g fine gold or 1.21 × 14.5 = 17.545 g fine silver.

The *Conventionsthaler* (*10-Thaler* standard, 23.386 g silver) contained 1⁄10 of a Cologne Mark and originally corresponded to exactly two *Conventionsgulden* (*20-Gulden* standard, 11.693 g silver), which meant that it could be one and the same coin as a double *gulden*. Consequently, half a *Conventionsthaler* was referred to as a *gulden*. However, this parity did not exist with the inferior south German lower denomination coins where the *Conventionsthaler* was worth two *gulden* and 12 *kreuzer*. The *gulden* coinage standard was therefore adjusted in 1760.

The *Conventionsthaler* was introduced as the successor to the *Reichsthaler* on 7 November 1750 in the Austrian crown lands. By the *Konventionsfuß* treaty of 20 September 1753, it was also introduced into the Bavarian Imperial Circle. Gradually it spread to southern Germany and Saxony. The last German *Conventionsthaler* was minted there in 1838. In Austria they were minted until 1856 before being superseded under the terms of the 1857 Vienna Minting Treaty.

The *Conventionsthaler* was the standard *thaler* coin issued by many mints in the Holy Roman Empire to the *20-Gulden* standard of the Minting Convention of 1753, according to which 10 coins were minted for each 5⁄6 of fine *mark* silver (= 1 Cologne *mark* ≈ 233 g of silver). For this reason, the inscription "X EINE FEINE MARK" is written on many *Conventionsthalers*. Its fine weight is therefore 23.385 grammes of silver according to the Cologne *mark* weight standard.

The *Conventionsthaler* was worth 32 *groschen*, in contrast to the *Reichstaler*, which was reckoned at 24 *groschen*. It was therefore a 4⁄3 (counting) *Reichstaler*.

The *Conventionsthaler* succeeded the *Reichsthaler* specie (containing 25.984 g fine silver) as the standard coin in most of the Holy Roman Empire, with a variety of subdivisions being used:

* 1 *Conventionsthaler* = 2 Austro-Hungarian florin, each florin equal to 20 *groschen* or 60 *kreuzer*.
* 1 *Conventionsthaler* = 2.4 South German gulden, each also containing 60 *kreuzer*.
* 1 *Conventionsthaler* = 1+1⁄3 North German thaler currency unit, each of 24 *groschen*.

Thus, converted to the theoretical (counting) *Reichstaler* of the old German Empire, which was worth 24 *groschen*, the *Conventionsthaler* corresponded to a *13+1⁄3-thaler* standard in relation to the Cologne *mark*. Meanwhile, the Prussian 'new' *Reichstaler*, minted in real terms from 1750 onwards, corresponded to a *14-thaler* standard developed by Johann Philipp Graumann. So it was lighter and therefore worth less. The new *Reichstaler* superseded the *Conventionsthaler* with the Dresden Coinage Treaty of 1838, according to which, in the countries of the German Customs Union (German: *Deutscher Zollverein*), 2 *thaler* minted to the *14-thaler* standard equalled 3+1⁄2 *gulden* to the *24+1⁄2-gulden* standard.

During the early 19th century, the *Conventionsthaler* of 1+1⁄3 *thaler* (17.5392 g fine silver per *thaler*) was superseded in Northern Germany by the Prussian thaler containing 1⁄14 of a Cologne mark or 16.70 g fine silver, while the *Conventionsthaler* of 2.4 South German gulden (9.73 g fine silver per gulden) was superseded by the 2.7-*gulden* *Kronenthaler* containing 9.524 g fine silver per gulden.
