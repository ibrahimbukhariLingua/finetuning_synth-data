## History

New Resource Bank was founded in 2006. The bank opened with 240 founding shareholders, including Triodos Bank and RSF Social Finance. It now has about 360 shareholders; major shareholders include the Generation IM Climate Solutions Fund, Triodos and RSF.

In 2010 New Resource became a B Corporation. B Corporations meet comprehensive social and environmental performance standards. New Resource Bank, which has been traded publicly in the over-the-counter market since its early days, was the first publicly traded company to become a certified B corporation. After the merger with Amalgamated Bank in May 2018, which is not a public company, New Resource Bank was no longer publicly traded.

During the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 a number of financial institutions including New Resource Bank sought to draw customers from more traditional financial institutions.

In May 2018 New Resource completed a merger with Amalgamated Bank.
