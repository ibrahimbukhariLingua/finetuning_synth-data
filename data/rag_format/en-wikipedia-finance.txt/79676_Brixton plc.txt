**Brixton plc** was a British-based property business headquartered in London. It was a former constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The firm was acquired by SEGRO in 2009.


## History

The company was founded in 1924 by Percy Mayer as *Brixton Estate Limited* to acquire a 6-acre (24,000 m²) site at Brixton Road in London.

In 1945 the company began to build up a portfolio by acquiring properties damaged by bombing during World War II.

In 1997 the company decided to focus on industrial properties to the West of London and in 2001 the name changed to *Brixton plc*.

The company converted to a Real Estate Investment Trust status when REITs were introduced in the United Kingdom in January 2007.

In August 2009 Brixton was taken over by SEGRO.
