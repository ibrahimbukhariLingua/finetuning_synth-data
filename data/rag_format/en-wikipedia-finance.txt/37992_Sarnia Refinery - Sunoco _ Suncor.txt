Sarnia Refinery - Sunoco & Suncor


# Sarnia Refinery - Sunoco & Suncor



The **Suncor Sarnia Refinery** is an 85,000 bpd cracking plant located in the "Chemical Valley" section of Sarnia, Ontario, Canada alongside the St. Clair River. The refinery has been in continuous operation since 1952 and supplies petroleum products to the southern Ontario region including Toronto and its suburbs via the Sun-Canadian Pipeline. The refinery has roughly 500 employees and contractors who work onsite.


## History


### Early beginnings (1940s–1950s)

In 1952, **Sun Oil Company** (later known as **Sunoco**, and eventually Suncor Energy), commissioned the Sarnia refinery. The location of the refinery in Sarnia was strategic due to its proximity to both the Alberta oil supply from the creation of the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company (now Enbridge) and major transportation routes along the Great Lakes. The Interprovincial Pipe Line was especially important to bringing Canadian crude to Sarnia. The connection was completed in 1953 and is now part of Enbridge's mainline system.


### The Suncor and Petro-Canada era (1990s–2010s)

During the period 1992-1995, Sun Oil "Sunoco" of Philadelphia sold its 75% ownership of Suncor Canada to the public. The final sale of 25% in 1995 severed Suncor and Sarnia Refinery from the much larger Sunoco. The Sarnia Refinery still maintains several physical pipeline connections to the former Sunoco Toledo, Ohio plant (now PBF) which is approximately twice the size of Sarnia. Sarnia served as Suncor's lone refinery until the purchase of the Commerce City Refinery in Denver, CO in 2003. In 2009, the merger between PetroCanada and Suncor meant that Sarnia would become part of a much larger refining system with plants in Edmonton and Montreal.

A major period of investment was undertaken from 2004-2007 at the site with modernization activities and the construction of several new units. The company disclosed that the total investment was $960 million. Tom Ryley, SVP of Refining said that “Suncor made a substantial investment to strengthen the integration between our oil sands operation in Northern Alberta and our Ontario-based businesses.” At peak, the construction project employed 1,600 workers. Suncor worked 5.8 million man hours without a lost time injury during this project.


## Notable features of the refinery


### Houdry Cracker

The Sarnia Refinery is home to a large Houdry Cat Cracker developed by Eugene Houdry, one of the only to ever be constructed. Houdry crackers were a precedent technology to Fluid Catalytic Crackers during WWII and served a critical role to the war effort. The first large Houdry unit was completed at Sunoco's Marcus Hook Refinery in Pennsylvania in 1937 and Sunoco was one of the only operators of the technology after the 1940s. The Houdry Unit at Sarnia has been in continuous operation for nearly 70 years and may be the last of its kind in operation.
