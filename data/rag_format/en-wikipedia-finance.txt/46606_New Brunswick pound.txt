New Brunswick pound


# New Brunswick pound



The **pound** was the currency of New Brunswick until 1860. It was divided into 20 *shillings*, each of 12 *pence*, with the dollar (initially the Spanish dollar) circulating at a value of 5/– (the Halifax rating).


## History

In 1852, New Brunswick adopted the same standard for its pound as the Province of Canada was using, with £1 stg. = £1.4s.4d local currency (see Canadian pound). The pound was replaced by the dollar in 1860, at a rate of 1 dollar = 5 shillings.


## Coins

In addition to sterling coin and Spanish dollars, copper tokens were issued in 1834 and 1854 in denominations of 1⁄2d and 1d.


## Banknotes

Five chartered banks issued notes, the *Bank of Fredericton* (1837-1838), the *Bank of New Brunswick* (1820-1860), the *Central Bank of New Brunswick* (1847-1860), the *Charlotte County Bank* (1852-1859) and the *Commercial Bank of New Brunswick* (1837-1860). Denominations issued were 5/–, 7/– and 10/–, £1, £2, £3, £5, £10 and £25. Some of the Bank of New Brunswick and Central Bank of New Brunswick's notes also bore the denomination in dollars.
