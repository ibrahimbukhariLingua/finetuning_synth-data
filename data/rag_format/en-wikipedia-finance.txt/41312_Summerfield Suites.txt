Summerfield Suites


# Summerfield Suites



**Summerfield Suites** was an extended stay hotel chain. It was bought by Hyatt and folded within that company in 2012. All Summerfield Suites Hotels are now branded as Hyatt House hotels.


## History

In June 2005, the Blackstone Group acquired Wyndham International for $3.2 billion. Summerfield Suites, Wyndham's extended-stay offering, was included in the deal. On December 1, 2005, Global Hyatt confirmed that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the 21-hotel Summerfield Suites brand from Blackstone for an undisclosed price. The deal concluded in early 2006, and closely followed Hyatt's acquisition of AmeriSuites – now re-branded as Hyatt Place. It took AmeriSuites' former position in the Hyatt lineup and competed in the upscale tier of the extended-stay market with Residence Inn, Homewood Suites, and Staybridge Suites.

Global Hyatt then developed an extended-stay prototype for converting Summerfield Suites hotels to a new Hyatt-branded extended-stay product. The new offering provides fully equipped 1 and 2 bedroom suites, a free hot breakfast buffet, an outdoor BBQ area, 24-hour convenience store, movie rental, dry cleaning and recreational facilities. However, Summerfield Suites targeted both the extended-stay market as well as the group travel market. The first location opened in 1990.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The hotels operated as *Hyatt Summerfield Suites* until 2012, when the chain was folded into Hyatt House, a then new division of Hyatt incorporating these hotels, as well as the former *Sierra Hotels*, which had also been bought by Hyatt. The Hyatt House name was a nod to the original name of the entire chain in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was called Hyatt House Hotels.
