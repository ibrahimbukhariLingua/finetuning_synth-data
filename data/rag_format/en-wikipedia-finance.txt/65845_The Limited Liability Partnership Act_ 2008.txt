## Taxation of a Limited Liability Partnership

The entire taxation of LLPs is similar to the existing taxation pattern applicable to Partnerships registered and formed under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932. The income of an LLP is taxed at the flat rate of 30% (plus surcharge and cess, as applicable) on the total income. However, the partners of an LLP are not taxed on the income that is earned by the LLP. Instead, the income is taxed in the hands of the partners only when it is distributed as profits or remuneration. Another advantage of LLPs is that they are exempt from dividend distribution tax, which is a tax that is levied on companies when they distribute dividends to their shareholders.
