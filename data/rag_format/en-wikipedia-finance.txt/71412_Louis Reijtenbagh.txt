In April 2009, JPMorgan Chase sued Reijtenbagh alleging Reijtenbagh defaulted on his obligations under a credit agreement as a result of the lawsuit filed by Credit Suisse Strategic Partners. The litigation was based on a material adverse change (MAC) in circumstances. Reijtenbagh reached a settlement with JP Morgan Chase in September 2009.

In October 2018, the Court of Antwerp approved a settlement between Reijtenbagh and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Antwerp (Belgium). The settlement is a legislated arrangement that provides a final and complete resolution of the dispute that concerned domicile-related tax and ancillary issues which allegedly occurred over a decade ago. The settlement did not constitute any conviction, nor any finding or admission of guilt, wrongdoing or misconduct whatsoever. Under the approved settlement, the Public Prosecutor's Office has discontinued the entire prosecution and dismissed all charges with prejudice. Accordingly, Reijtenbagh has been cleared of all charges and allegations.
