Adjusted basis


# Adjusted basis



In tax accounting, **adjusted basis** is the net cost of an asset after adjusting for various tax-related items.

**Adjusted Basis** or **Adjusted Tax Basis** refers to the original cost or other basis of property, reduced by depreciation deductions and increased by capital expenditures.

**Example:** Muhammad buys a lot for $100,000. He then erects a retail facility for $600,000, then depreciates the improvements for tax purposes at the rate of $15,000 per year. After three years his adjusted tax basis is $655,000 = $100,000 + $600,000 - (3 x $15,000).

Adjusted basis is one of two variables in the formula used to compute gains and losses when determining gross income for tax purposes. The Amount Realized – Adjusted Basis tells the amount of Realized Gain (if positive) or Realized Loss (if negative).


## Statutory definition

Section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code defines “basis” as a taxpayer's cost in acquiring property, except as provided in Sections 1001–1092. Section 1016 then lists 27 adjustments to this basis. Generally, improvements to property increase basis while depreciation deductions decrease it.


## Calculation

Adjusted basis is calculated by beginning with an asset's original cost basis, and then making adjustments. Adjusted basis is calculated as follows:

* Purchase costs (title & escrow fees, broker commissions, shipping, sales tax, etc.)
* Improvements (rehabilitation expenses & substantial repairs)
* Legal fees (to defend or to perfect title to the property, zoning costs, etc.)
* Selling costs (title & escrow fees, broker commissions, shipping, transfer fees, etc.)

Minus the costs represented by:

* Accumulated depreciation, depletion, or amortization
* Casualty or theft Loss
* Other decreases to basis

### Adjusted basis

Adjusted basis is crucial for calculating capital gains and ordinary gains when an asset is sold.

A complete list of adjustments which increase or decrease basis is found in *IRS* Publication 551, Basis of Assets.
