# H.R. 4002 (113th Congress)



The bill **H.R.Â 4002** is a bill that would accept the request of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to revoke the charter of incorporation issued to that tribe and ratified by its members on June 1, 1940.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.


## Background

The Miami Tribe of Oklahoma is the only federally recognized Native American tribe of Miami Indians in the United States. The people are descended from Miami who were removed in the 19th century from their traditional territory in present-day Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. Of the 3,908 enrolled tribal members, 775 live in the state of Oklahoma. Enrollment in the tribe is based on documented lineal descent. They adopted a corporate charter on June 1, 1940, as a result of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act.

H.R. 4002 would revoke the charter of incorporation of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma. Based on information provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would have no effect on the federal budget. The tribe has not been operating under the charter for the last several decades. Enacting H.R. 4002 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.

H.R. 4002 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.


## Procedural history

H.R. 4002 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on February 5, 2014, by Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R, OK-2). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs. It was reported on April 28, 2014, alongside House Report 113-420. The bill was scheduled to be voted on by the House on June 23, 2014.


## Debate and discussion

The Department of the Interior testified that they had no objection to the charter being revoked saying that the "decision whether to maintain or revoke such a charter ultimately should be the Tribe's."
