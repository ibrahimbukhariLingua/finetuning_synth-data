## Controversy

In response to a directive from a Gurugram court, authorities filed an FIR against UAE-based realtor company Emaar Properties PJSC, its Indian subsidiary Emaar India, and 13 others. The allegations included cheating MGF, their former business partner, through the undervaluation of land and other offenses. Emaar India refuted any criminal association, describing the accusations as an attempt by MGF to harass Emaar and its employees.

The FIR, initiated on November 20,2023, following an order by Chief Judicial Magistrate Ramesh Chander, names Emaar Properties PJSC, Emaar India Ltd, director Bharat Bhushan Garg, and others. According to the complaint filed by Saurabh Singh on behalf of MGF Development Limited, the accused undervalued land in Gurugram sectors, allegedly with the assistance of Jones Lang Laselle (JLL), an independent valuer. The complaint asserts that forged valuation reports were created to cause wrongful loss to MGF. Additionally, Emaar is accused of exploiting warranty indemnity and litigation indemnity agreements for personal gain, leading to losses for MGF.
