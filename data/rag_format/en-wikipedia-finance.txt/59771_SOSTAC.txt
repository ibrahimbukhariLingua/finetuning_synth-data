SOSTAC


# SOSTAC



**SOSTAC** is a marketing model developed by PR Smith in the 1990s and later formalized in his 1998 book *Marketing Communications*, the subsequent series of *SOSTAC Guides to your Perfect Plan* (2011) and the *SOSTAC Guide to your Perfect Digital Marketing Plan* (2020).

It is an acronym for Smith's six fundamental facets of marketing: situation, objectives, strategy, tactics, action and control.

SOSTAC contains a general marketing strategy which can be applied in various commercial situations. It includes an in-depth SWOT analysis, which helps businesses get ready for marketing campaigns; the main difference is that SOSTAC also focuses on the implementation stages of the process, on marketing communications and now, digital marketing.

The structure of SOSTAC is a simple logic that builds on an in-depth Situation Analysis which informs subsequent decisions made about strategy and tactics. Its logic can enable better decision making and therefore better plans .

Marketing experts have adapted SOSTAC to a number of specific situations, including direct marketing and electronic marketing. The steps in the process have also been adapted to the development of internet security systems and company business plans.


## Steps in SOSTAC

* *Situation* assesses where a business is presently (where are you now?).
* *Objectives* set the mission or goals for the business (where do you want to be?).
* *Strategy* is an overview of how to achieve the objectives (how do you get there?).
* *Tactics* are the details of strategy (e.g. the marketing mix) (how exactly do we get there?)
* *Actions* how do you ensure excellent execution of the plan. (what is our plan?)
* *Control* establishes how you know whether you are getting there (what do you monitor?).
