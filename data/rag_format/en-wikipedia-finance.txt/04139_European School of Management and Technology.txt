European School of Management and Technology


# European School of Management and Technology



The **European School of Management and Technology**, also known as **ESMT Berlin**, is a private non-profit business school based in Berlin, Germany. The business school was founded in 2002 by 25 companies and institutions and offers a range of MBAs, master's degrees, and other degree and executive education programs.

The owner of the business school is the ESMT European School of Management and Technology GmbH (ESMT GmbH), which is recognized as a non-profit organization. ESMT Berlin is regarded as one of the most prestigious business schools in Europe. It is one of four business schools in Germany with triple accreditation from EQUIS, AACSB, and AMBA.


## History

ESMT Berlin was founded on October 31, 2002, by 25 multinational corporations seeking to break from the traditional approaches of German executive education by creating a more international business school in Germany.

The founding companies invested approximately 65 million euros into the ESMT foundation, which owns the school. In October 2003, ESMT Berlin was granted permission from the Senate of Berlin to operate as a private university. Initially, programs were held in Munich, while the ESMT campus in Berlin was under construction until 2006.

In December 2006, the first students at the business school received their degrees. Following financial problems, a further 60 million euros was invested in ESMT Berlin's endowment fund in 2010. Since then, the university has been fully financed.

In December 2013, the state of Berlin authorized ESMT Berlin to award doctorates for five years, while extending ESMT's status as a private university for an additional ten years. Since 2008, the university has been participating in the Berlin Doctoral Program in Economics and Management Science (BDPEMS), which merged into the Berlin School of Economics in 2019.

Besides the main campus in Berlin, the school operated a campus Cologne, Schloss Gracht, until 2018. The historic castle and grounds, which served as the Metternich family's residence for centuries, became the site of ESMT's German-language executive education courses right after the school's foundation. Following integration of these courses into the main campus of ESMT, Schloss Gracht was sold in 2018.

In 2022, the foundation assets amounted to around 123 million euros. In early 2024, over 1,000 students were enrolled, and 45 faculty members were employed at ESMT.


## Organisation

The school focuses on management, analytics, and innovation and is a state-accredited university. ESMT has a satellite campus in Berlin-Schöneberg and a branch office in Shanghai. The school has more than 8,000 alumni in chapters located worldwide and around 3,500 executives and managers participate in the ESMT Executive Development Programs each year.

The main governance structures are the Executive Management Committee, chaired by Jörg Rocholl, PhD, President and Managing Director of ESMT Berlin, and the Supervisory Board of ESMT GmbH chaired by Werner Zedelius, Senior Advisor at Allianz SE. Former presidents before Rocholl were Derek F. Abell (until 2006) and Lars-Hendrik Röller (from 2006 to 2011). The Board of Trustees of the ESMT Foundation consists of Chairman Ola Källenius and Deputy Chairman Christian Sewing.

Master's students also take part in targeted internships, social impact projects and additional finance courses.

## Campus

The school's headquarters and main campus is located in the former GDR State Council Building in Berlin next to the Federal Foreign Office and opposite of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Museum Island. It was constructed in the 1960s socialist architectural style to host the State Council of East Germany. From 1999 to 2001, the building served as the Federal Chancellery (Berlin) under former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. In the years 2004 and 2005, the building underwent an extensive renovation supervised by the German architect HG Merz.

Since its renovation, the former State Council Building has acted as a venue for seminars, lectures, conferences, and social events at ESMT Berlin. The building received further improvements in 2017, with the remodeling of the third floor to accommodate the significant increase in the number of students. This led to the creation of a new library, four seminar rooms, the ESMT research lab, eleven group study rooms and a student lounge. Since 2023, the last unused part of the State Council building has also been under renovation. In November 2023, a photovoltaic system was installed on the roof of the main building, which is expected to cover around 25% of the university's electricity requirements.

Around 80% of ESMT students move to Germany from abroad. Members of a program often originate from up to 40 nations. In 2018, the university planned to build a student residence on campus, in particular for its international students, but the project was rejected by the Berlin Senate.


## Events

The ESMT Annual Forum was held at ESMT Berlin from 2008 to 2022. The forum was attended by German and international individuals from various sectors such as business and politics. In 2023 for the first time, the ESMT hosted the Berlin Global Dialogue, including guests such as Olaf Scholz and Charles Michel.
