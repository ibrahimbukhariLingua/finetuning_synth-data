## History

The Rastogi family started trading metals in India during the 1950s. In the late 1980s, at age 20, Virendra Rastogi founded a New York office of Allied Deals and by 2002 the family was even listed in the London Sunday Times Rich List. Rastogi's younger brother Virendra ran a related company, RBG Resources based in London.

Allied Deals Inc. established hundreds of sham companies to allegedly trade in non-ferrous metals, and in the process committed a litany of criminal acts including: forging documents, faking credit histories, and impersonation of another person - acting as buyers to the banks.

The scheme collapsed in 2002 with the legal outcome of fifteen people arrested and charged in the United States with Nine pleading guilty; five were convicted by Jury; and one was acquitted of all charges. Two further defendants are still at large. Three people in the United Kingdom were also convicted and found guilty.
