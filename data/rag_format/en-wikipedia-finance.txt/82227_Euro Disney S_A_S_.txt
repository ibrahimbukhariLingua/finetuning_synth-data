**Euro Disney S.A.S.** is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company responsible for Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France.

Disneyland Paris comprises Disneyland Park, Walt Disney Studios Park, Disney Village, and seven on-site Disney Hotels. Val d'Europe is a new residential and shopping development. Another seven hotels/residences have been built not far from the two Disney theme parks on land held under Euro Disney SCA's lease, including properties from companies such as Holiday Inn, Kyriad, MyTravel and Radisson Hotels.

Prior to 2017, it was a publicly listed French company Euro Disney S.C.A. Since then has been de-listed and become a wholly owned subsidiary. Euro Disney S.C.A was a result of an agreement signed on 24 March 1987 between The Walt Disney Company and the French Authorities for the development of a new tourist destination, and construction began within a year. Since opening on 12 April 1992, the Resort has created more than 30,000 jobs (both directly and indirectly) in the region to the east of Paris. In 2012, it was the number one tourist destination in Europe with 16 million visits recorded. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.


## History

A letter of intent was signed on 15 December 1985 by CEO Michael Eisner and then French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius in regards to building the theme park at Marne-la-Vallée, France on 4400 acres. The theme park plans were approved by the Île-de-France regional council on 11 July 1986. The Walt Disney Company appointed Robert Fitzpatrick as Euro Disneyland president on 12 March 1987. On 24 March 1987 Euro Disney signed an agreement with the French government. Construction on Euro Disney Resort began in August 1988.

Euro Disney went public by trading on the Paris Stock Exchange on 8 October at US$14 a share with 42.9 million shares sold. However, French communists pelted Eisner with eggs, flour and tomato sauce during the stock launch.
