# MuleSoft



**MuleSoft, LLC.** is a software company headquartered in San Francisco, California, that provides integration software for connecting applications, data and devices, founded in 2006. The company's Anypoint Platform of integration products is designed to integrate software as a service (SaaS), on-premises software, legacy systems and other platforms.

In 2018, Mulesoft was acquired by Salesforce for $6.5 billion in a cash-and-stock deal.


## History

MuleSource, as the company was originally called, was founded by Ross Mason and Dave Rosenberg in 2006. The company was built around the successful Open Source Software (OSS) project, Mule, which Ross Mason founded in 2003. The "mule" in the name comes from the drudgery, or "donkey work," of data and application integration that the platform was created to escape.
The company changed its name to MuleSoft in 2009. MuleSoft originally provided middleware and messaging, and later expanded to provide an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) approach for companies through its main product, Anypoint Platform.

In April 2013, the company announced $37 million in Series E financing in a round led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from new strategic investor Salesforce.com, and existing investors Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, Sapphire Ventures (formerly SAP Ventures) and Bay Partners. This brought MuleSoft's total financing, over the course of seven rounds, to $259 million.

In April 2013, MuleSoft acquired ProgrammableWeb, a website used by developers to help build web, mobile and other connected applications through APIs.

In February 2017, the company filed for an IPO, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 17, 2017.

In March 2018, Salesforce.com announced it was buying MuleSoft in a deal reported to be worth $6.5 billion; the acquisition was completed in May of that year.


## Products

MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform includes Anypoint Design Center, which allows API developers to design and build APIs; Anypoint Exchange, a library for API providers to share APIs, templates, and assets; and Anypoint Management Center, a centralized web interface to analyze, manage, and monitor APIs and integrations. MuleSoft also offers the Mule runtime engine for connecting enterprise applications on-premises and to the cloud, designed to eliminate the need for custom point-to-point integration code.ʲᵃʳᵍᵒⁿ
