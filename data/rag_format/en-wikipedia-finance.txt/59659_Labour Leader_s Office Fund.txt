## Quotes about the fund

* "While it does not necessarily follow that the scheme was anything other than the model of probity, there is at least an argument that Lloyd George knew its father." —David Osler, author of *Labour Party PLC: New Labour as a Party of Business*. (Lloyd George was infamous for selling honours in the early 20th century.)
