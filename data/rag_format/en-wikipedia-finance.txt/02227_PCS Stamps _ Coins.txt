## History

Postal Commemorative Society ("PCS") was first formed in 1970 as a division of MBI. Its first product was U.S. first day of issue covers.

In 1973, MBI was still a subsidiary of Glendinning Companies. It consisted of two divisions, Postal Commemorative Society and The Danbury Mint. In December 1975, MBI ended all its legal ties with Glendinning Companies and became an independent business. Easton Press was formed in 1975 as MBI's third division.

In 2006, Postal Commemorative Society changed its name to PCS Stamps & Coins to reflect the shift in its product offers.
