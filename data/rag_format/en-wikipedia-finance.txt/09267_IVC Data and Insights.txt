# IVC Data and Insights



**IVC Data & Insights** is a provider of business intelligence and data on the Israeli technology, venture capital and private equity sectors. It offers comprehensive databases, analysis and insights into Israel's high-tech ecosystem.


## History

IVC was founded in 1997 by Zeev Holtzman, the founder and managing partner of Giza VC, and his son Guy Holtzman. IVC was established to strengthen the relations between foreign investors and the Israeli technology industry.

In its early years, IVC managed its data using Microsoft Access Database Engine and published a hard-copy newsletter that included articles, research and information on technology deals related to Israel. This newsletter was distributed to a wide range of figures – particularly local and international investors, interested in the Israeli tech ecosystem.

In April 1999, IVC was incorporated as IVC Research Center. During that year, IVC launched its website, which featured a search engine allowing users to explore data on startups, investors, professionals, corporations, and other organizations and personals involved in Israel's tech industry.

In 2000, IVC published Israel's first high-tech directory, which included articles, statistics, and detailed profiles of investors and startups, including information such as business descriptions, financing rounds, and contact details.

In 2020, IVC rebranded from IVC Research Center to IVC Data & Insights. This rebranding reflected a shift in focus from a service company – providing personalized consulting and analytical services, to a data-driven company – offering products accessible online.

In 2023, Guy Holtzman replaced Zeev Holtzman as the Chairman of IVC, and Ben Klein was promoted to CEO, taking over the role from Guy Holtzman.

As of 2025, IVC serves strategic and financial investors, venture capital funds, family offices, private equity funds, multinational corporations, NGOs, academic institutions, service providers, media groups, startups, and more. IVC also supports NGOs by helping them connect with relevant donors and potential board members using its data analytics tools. Among the NGOs IVC supports are: Tmura, Education For Excellence, IFIE – The Israeli Forum For Impact Economy and Alon and Ella.
