# Andreessen Horowitz



**AH Capital Management, LLC** (commonly known as **Andreessen Horowitz**, or **a16z**) is an American privately held venture capital firm, founded in 2009 by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. The company is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. As of May 2024, Andreessen Horowitz ranks first on the list of venture capital firms by assets under management, with $42 billion.

Andreessen Horowitz invests in both early-stage startups and established growth companies. Its investments span the healthcare, consumer, cryptocurrency, gaming, fintech, education, and enterprise IT (including cloud computing, security, and software as a service) industries.


## Founding and partnering

Between 2006 and 2010, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz actively invested in technology companies. Separately, and together, they invested $4 million in 45 startups, including Twitter. During this time, the two became known as "super angel" investors.

On July 6, 2009, Andreessen and Horowitz launched their venture capital fund with an initial capitalization of $300 million. In November 2010, at a time when the field of venture capitalism was contracting, the company raised another $650 million for a second venture fund. In less than two years, the firm was managing a total of $1.2 billion under the two funds.

As of March 27, 2014, the firm managed $4 billion in assets after the closing of its fourth fund at $1.5 billion.

In addition to Andreessen and Horowitz, the firm's general partners include John O'Farrell, Scott Weiss, Jeff Jordan, Peter Levine, Chris Dixon, Vijay Pande, Martin Casado, Andrew Chen, and Sriram Krishnan.

As of May 2024, the firm manages $42 billion in assets.


## Notable investments


### 2009

In 2009, Andreessen Horowitz made its two first investments: one in business management SaaS developer Apptio and one in Skype stock. According to Horowitz, the investment was seen as risky by other experts in the field who believed the company would be crippled by ongoing intellectual property litigation and direct competitive attacks from Google and Apple.

In August 2022, the firm announced it would invest about $350 million in Flow, the latest organization begun by WeWork founder Adam Neumann. Flow's purported aim is to create a branded product in the housing market with consistent community features, reimagining how real estate works in the US. The decision was met with some criticism due to Neumann's business issues in his time at WeWork.

The firm committed to $400 million in equity investment toward the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk that completed in October 2022. According to the Washington Post, by September 2024, the firm had lost $288 million on its Twitter investment.


## Structure

Andreessen Horowitz partners work on behalf of all its portfolio companies, an approach modeled after the Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency. In 2010, the company hired Margit Wennmachers, a marketing executive at the partner level.

As of 2011, the firm had maintained a database of designers, coders, and executives and used it to help fill positions at its startups. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers became a special advisor to Andreessen Horowitz in June 2011.

In 2012, former Washington D.C. mayor Adrian Fenty was appointed Andreessen Horowitz's second special advisor. Fenty was hired to advise the firm's portfolio companies on working with local, state, and federal governments.

In 2019, the firm applied to restructure as a registered investment adviser in order to have more freedom to take up riskier bets like cryptocurrency.
