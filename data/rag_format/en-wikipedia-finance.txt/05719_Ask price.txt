Ask price


# Ask price



**Ask price** (also called **offer price**, **offer**, **selling price**, **asking price**, or simply **ask**) is the price a seller states they will accept.

The seller may qualify the stated asking price as firm or negotiable. Firm means the seller is implying that the price is fixed and will not change.

In bid and ask, the term ask price is used in contrast to the term bid price. The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called the spread.
