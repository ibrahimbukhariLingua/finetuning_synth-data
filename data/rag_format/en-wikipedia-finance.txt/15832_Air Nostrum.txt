# Air Nostrum



**Air Nostrum** (doing business as **Iberia Regional**) is a Spanish regional airline based in Valencia.

An affiliate member of the Oneworld airline alliance, it operates 91 domestic and international routes to 51 destinations, and charter flights. Its main base is Valencia Airport, with hubs at Barcelona–El Prat Airport and Madrid–Barajas Airport.

Limited operations are also carried out on behalf of Brussels Airlines, replacing related wet-lease specialist airline CityJet, having begun in late 2018. Air Nostrum is also a part owner of Iryo, a Spanish high-speed rail service which began operating in November 2022.

In October 2023, it was announced that Air Nostrum had completed its merger with CityJet. Furthermore, it was reported that its current shareholders would have controlling interest (80%) of the entity created from the merger, Strategic Alliance of Regional Airlines (SARA).


## History

The airline was established on 23 May 1994 and started operations on 15 December. It used to offer a comprehensive meal service on all scheduled flights.

In early 2008, the airline eliminated its 'regional business class' cabin. The cabin is now split into separate business and economy sections along the lines of other major airlines. Economy passengers can purchase drinks and snacks from an onboard menu.

On February 7, 2012, Air Nostrum presented an ERE (a legal form of workforce reduction and redundancies) that will affect its 1,800 workers for two years, due to the increase in fuel prices and the drop in income. It is estimated that during the two years, 15 Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft will be grounded and most of its routes will be abandoned at a loss.

On March 31, 2014, the airline announced the entry into the company's capital of a group of Valencian businessmen with the participation of the then CEO of the company, Carlos Bertomeu, as well as Antonio Pellicer and José Remohí, owners of the IVI, with an estimated capital of 25 million euros, divided between capital and debt.

In September 2017, it filed an application to operate high speed rail services from Madrid Atocha to Gare de Montpellier-Saint-Roch in Southern France from 5 October 2018 with AVE Class 100 trains leased from Renfe Operadora.

On 17 July 2018, Air Nostrum and CityJet of Ireland announced they would merge to form the largest regional airline in Europe, however will remain as separate brands. The merger was completed in 2023.

In June 2022, it was announced that Air Nostrum had placed a reservation on ten Hybrid Air Vehicles Airlander 10 airships. Introduction to service is scheduled for 2026. In August 2023, Air Nostrum doubled their reservation from ten to twenty HAV Airlander 10 aircraft.
