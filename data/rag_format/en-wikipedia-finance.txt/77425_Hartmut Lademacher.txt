In 1990, Lademacher founded, together with Joachim Hertel, Rainer Zimmermann and other executives at IBM where he had been working, the company LHS Specifications GmbH (LHS Telekommunikation) in Dietzenbach. LHS is an acronym for "Lademacher and Hertel Software". In 1997 the company went as the third company ever in the new market. In 2000, the company was sold for 4.7 billion euros to Sema.
