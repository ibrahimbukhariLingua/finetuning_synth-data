## Reception


### Academic reception

There has been some academic research into the accuracy of the Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast. A 2003 paper by Carol T. West (published just two years after the forecast became operational) pointed to the data set from the Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast as a valuable information source for future studies of the accuracy of regional forecasts. A 2009 paper by Phillips and Lopez used the Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast data to compare the accuracy of different forecasters and models, and found that some forecasters consistently outperformed others. Moreover, based on an informal survey of the most accurate forecasters, it found that they were likely to use formal statistical models rather than pure judgment. The Dallas Fed's model used to forecast growth in Texas was found to be one of the more accurate forecasting models.


### Reception in financial press and blogs

The Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast has been cited in *Forbes* as one of the few sources of regional forecasts for the economy of the United States. It has also been cited in a number of regional business journals in discussions of regional economic prospects.
