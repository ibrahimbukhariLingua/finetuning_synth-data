In 1982, the Salvadoran political parties decided that it was time to move on from the rule of the Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) and decided to install Magaña as head of state.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Soon afterward, both political parties met at Magaña's farm in Apaneca and decided that under Magaña's provisional government, both parties would share in the ministerial posts.

José Napoleón Duarte willingly relinquished his power as head of state and head of the Junta to Magaña briefly and instead focused on building up his own Christian Democratic Party with the help of the United States and planned to take back power in the 1984 elections.
