# NLB Group



**NLB Group** is the largest banking and financial group in Slovenia, with the core of its activity being in Southeast Europe.

NLB has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.


## History

Banking members of NLB Group cover markets with a population of approximately 17.4 million people. In addition to NLB d.d., a main entity in Slovenia, NLB Group comprises several subsidiary banks in Southeast Europe: NLB Banka Skopje, NLB Banka Sarajevo, NLB Banka Banja Luka, NLB Banka Prishtina, NLB Komercijalna banka, NLB Banka Podgorica, several companies for ancillary services (asset management, leasing, real estate management etc.) and a limited number of non-core subsidiaries controlled wind-down.

NLB d.d. is as of 14 November 2018 a publicly listed company owned by a diversified investor base and whose largest shareholder is the Republic of Slovenia with a 25% plus one share. With the acquisition of the Serbian Komercijalna banka in December 2020, the Group further strengthened its strategic and systemic position in the region and now holds a top 3 position in six out of seven markets where it has a banking presence.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In March 2022, the EU unit of Sberbank went into insolvency due to the EU sanctions in reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Single Resolution Board decided to transfer all shares of the Sberbank's Slovenian subsidiary, later renamed to N Banka, to NLB. On 2 March, NLB officially bought the local unit of Sberbank, thus increasing its assets by approximately 1.0 billion euros. In September 2023 operational merger of N Banka to NLB was successfully completed.

In November 2023, NLB entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% shareholding in SLS HOLDCO, holdinška družba, the parent company of Summit Leasing Slovenija and its Croatian subsidiary, Mobil Leasing; with transaction successfully completed in September 2024.

NLB Group performed strongly in the full year 2023 with EUR 550.7 million of result after tax. The results enable NLB to significantly increase dividend payments to 40% pay-out ratio of previous years’ profit after tax, which in 2024 translates to EUR 220 million in dividends. This represents a 100% increase from dividend payments made in 2023.

In the first quarter of 2024, NLB Group achieved EUR 140.0 million of result after tax; while in the second quarter vivid lending dynamics, a stable and improving business environment in the South-eastern European (SEE) region where the Group operates, and strong operational trends led to EUR 152.0 million in Result After Tax, a 9% quarterly growth. The third quarter of 2024 has added EUR 135.5 million to NLB Group’s EUR 427.5 million profit after tax in the first nine months of this year.
