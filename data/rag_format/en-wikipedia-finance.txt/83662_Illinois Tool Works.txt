## ITW subsidiaries

ITW comprises a number of subsidiaries. Notable brands include Hobart, Miller Electric, Paslode, Foster Refrigerator, Brooks Instrument, and Permatex adhesives. In August 2018, U.S. Tax Court Judge Albert G. Lauber determined that ITW owed no tax on over $356 million in repatriated funds from its foreign subsidiaries because the transactions had been sufficiently structured as debt.


## Illegal exports

The United States Department of Commerce imposed a $142,000 civil penalty on Illinois Tool Works in 2000, to settle allegations that the company illegally exported chemicals to Brazil on seven occasions between March 1994 and October 1997 without the required licenses and making false or misleading statements on Shipper's Export Declarations. Illinois Tool Works agreed to pay the penalty. $37,000 was suspended as part of the settlement. The chemicals exported can be used for commercial purposes and in the making of chemical weapons as well.
