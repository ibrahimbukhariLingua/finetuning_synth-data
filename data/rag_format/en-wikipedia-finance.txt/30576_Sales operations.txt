clear objectives and a good understanding of the requirements of customers and the business's market environment can contribute to better sales outcomes.


## Sales target

A sales target is the minimum sales goal for a set time span. A sales target may be a minimum amount of value (monetary) or product sold (volume). Sales targets may also be for sales activities, such as number of calls per day. Management usually sets the sales targets and the sales territory. The time span could be set for the day, week, month, fiscal quarter or year.

In some businesses, staff pay includes earn a bonus that a member of staff may earn for reaching a specific sales target.


## Sales territory

A sales territory is usually the customer group or geographical area assigned to an individual salesperson or a sales team. The geographical area may also be assigned to a franchisee, distributor, or agent. A territory may also be assigned by industry verticals, such as all retailers or all wholesalers in a geographical area. A sales territory may be as large as a continent, country, state or province, or as small as a precinct, suburb, town or city. Generally, a sales manager will assign a sales territory based on the territories of the sales resources reporting to him/her.


## Sales forecasting

Sales forecasting uses past sales figures to predict the short-term or long-term future performance to enable sound financial planning. Historical sales and/or economic data is often used to improve the forecast of sales.

For shops and stores, market research may yield the following indicators for deriving initial forecasts:

* average sales volume per unit area for similar shops in similar locations of similar size
* number of consumers or consumer households in appropriate vicinity of the store and their annual expenses on the product in question.
