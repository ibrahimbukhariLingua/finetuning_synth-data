Centre for Economic Performance


# Centre for Economic Performance



The **Centre for Economic Performance** (CEP) is an interdisciplinary research centre at the London School of Economics dedicated to the study of economic growth and effective ways to create a fair, inclusive and sustainable society. Currently led by Prof. Stephen Machin, it is one of the world's most prestigious economic research institutes, being the most important economic research institute in the United Kingdom, jointly with the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Its research performance has been particularly strong in the research areas of labour economics, productivity, happiness economics, human capital, the knowledge economy, ICT, innovation, education, and European microeconomic issues.


## History

The Centre for Economic Performance was founded in 1990 at the London School of Economics with funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to conduct research on the determinants of economic performance, especially in Britain.

The CEP was awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize in 2002. The prize citation described the centre as “widely renowned for its application of economic theory and rigorous empirical analysis to issues of unemployment, productivity, the economics of education and international trade”. It added the CEP had a significant impact on government policy in the UK and abroad and had become Europe’s leading body for the study of globalisation and international trade.

CEP's programme on macroeconomics became a separate part of the newly-founded Centre for Macroeconomics in 2012.

In April 2018, the ESRC acknowledged the centre's sustained strategic value to social science research by awarding it institute status.


## Organisation

The Centre for Economic Performance is led by director Stephen Machin alongside research director Henry Overman. Its work is supervised by a policy committee, which comprises 11 members drawn from business, academia and government and is chaired by Nicholas Macpherson (former Permanent Secretary to the Treasury). CEP's research is structured into six research programmes:

* Community (Prof. Alan Manning) and Wellbeing (Prof. Lord Richard Layard)
* Education and Skills (Prof. Sandra McNally)
* Growth (Dr Anna Valero)
* Labour Markets (Dr Guy Michaels)
* Trade (Dr Catherine Thomas)
* Urban (Prof. Daniel M. Sturm)

Additionally, CEP researchers are involved in several related centres and projects, e.g. the Centre for Vocational Education Research, The Programme on Innovation and Diffusion and the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth.
