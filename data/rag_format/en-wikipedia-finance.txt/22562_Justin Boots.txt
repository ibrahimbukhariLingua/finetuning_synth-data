## History

Herman Joseph Justin, the son of a cigar maker, started repairing boots in Spanish Fort, Texas. After receiving a loan to purchase materials, he began making his own cowboy boots.

Justin was an early user of decorative stitching, incorporating rows of stitches across the boot tops as a means of stiffening the leather, preventing it from folding around the ankles.

In 1887, Justin married Louanna "Annie" Allen. In the early 1890s, Annie Justin developed a self-measuring kit, making it possible for customers to order the company's products by mail.

When a railroad was built in Nocona, Texas, in 1889, the Justins moved there to capitalize on the larger market opportunity. "Daddy Joe" and Annie had seven children — three sons and four daughters — who each helped with the family business. In 1908, Justin told his two oldest sons, John and Earl, that they would become equal partners in the family business. He then changed the name of his boot company to H.J. Justin & Sons.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Justins moved the business to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1925, except for daughter Enid Justin, who believed her father would have wanted the business to remain in Nocona. She later founded Nocona Boots.

In 1947, annual sales reached $1 million. Three years later, Joe's grandson, John Justin Jr., bought out the company's stock and gained control of the company. On Nov. 3, 1950, John Jr. became vice president and general manager of H.J. Justin & Sons, Inc.

The company merged with Acme Brick Company in 1968 to become First Worth Corporation. In 1972, John Justin Jr. was elected president and chairman of the board, and the company's name officially changed to Justin Industries, Inc.

Nocona Boot Company became part of Justin Industries when John Justin purchased the controlling shares from his aunt, Enid Justin, in 1981. In 1984, the company acquired Chippewa Shoe Company. In 1990, Justin Industries purchased competitor Tony Lama Boots.

In 1999, John Justin stepped down from his role as chairman of the board of Justin Industries, Inc., and in 2000 the board of directors for Justin Industries approved the sale of the company to Warren Buffett and the Berkshire-Hathaway Corp.
