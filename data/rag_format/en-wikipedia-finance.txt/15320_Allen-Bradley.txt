## History

The company was founded in 1903 as the *Compression Rheostat Company* by Dr. Stanton Allen and Lynde Bradley with an initial investment of $1,000. In 1910 the firm was renamed *Allen-Bradley Company*; for nearly a century it provided the bulk of discrete resistors used for electronics and other products.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 1952 it opened a subsidiary in Galt, Ontario, Canada, that employs over 1000 people.

During the mid-20th century, mid-sized firms such as Allen-Bradley tended to embrace reactionary politics out of a fear that increased government regulation would cut into their profits. Unlike large, multinational corporations that dealt directly with customers, historian Rick Perlstein argues that these smaller companies were less concerned about potential public blowback. Allen-Bradley paid for propaganda posters that asked “Will You Be Free to Celebrate Christmas in the Future?” and circulated allegations that the Soviet Union was using mind-control techniques to keep communist nations in line. One of the company's founders, Harry Lynde Bradley, was a founding member of the John Birch Society and co-founded the Bradley Foundation, a right-wing think tank.

In 1968, the NAACP and the Latino community joined in a march to protest Allen-Bradley's discriminatory hiring practices, an event that marked the beginning of Latino activism in Milwaukee.

In 1985 a company record was set as the fiscal year ended with $1 billion in sales. In February 1985, Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion (equivalent to $3.97 billion in 2023), which is the largest acquisition in Wisconsin history. Allen-Bradley essentially took control of Rockwell's industrial automation division.

Rockwell eventually moved its headquarters to Milwaukee. In 2002, when Rockwell split into two companies, Allen-Bradley followed the automation division into Rockwell Automation.
