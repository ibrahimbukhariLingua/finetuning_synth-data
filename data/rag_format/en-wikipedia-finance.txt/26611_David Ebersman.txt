### Facebook

In September 2009, Ebersman joined Facebook as the company's chief financial officer, hired in part because he had "public company experience". He oversaw the company's initial public offering on May 18, 2012—then the largest U.S. Internet offering of all time. The IPO proved controversial after the company's market value dropped significantly over the following weeks. In a *New York Times* article, Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed to Ebersman's culpability for the "catastrophe of an initial public offering," writing "if there is one single individual more responsible than any other for the staggering mispricing of Facebook's I.P.O., it is Mr. Ebersman."
