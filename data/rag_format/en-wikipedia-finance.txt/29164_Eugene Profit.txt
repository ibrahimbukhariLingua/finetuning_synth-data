## Early life

During his first season of varsity football as a sophomore in 1983, he was involved in 40 tackles (25 solos) and recovered one fumble. He set Yale single season records for kick returns (20) and kick return yardage (328) for a 16.4 average.

After joining the Washington Redskins in 1989, he tore a hamstring in the first exhibition game.

At the end of his football career in 1990, Profit earned his peak NFL salary of $200,000.

In 1996, he left Legg Mason to start his own investment management firm Profit Investment Management, serving as the firm's President and Chief executive Officer.


## Profit Investments

Profit founded Profit Investment Management in 1996. He began as the firm's President and Chief Executive Officer but later took on the role of Portfolio Manager in 1997.


### Investment philosophy

Profit's investment philosophy is similar to traditional value strategies that look for fundamentally undervalued companies; however, he does not adhere to traditional price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. His strategy focuses on finding mispriced growth stocks that he believes can benefit from investor's revaluation of the relationship between the company's fundamentals and the stock's price.


## Charitable causes

Profit is also active in philanthropy and contributes to programs that aim to help the community and improve financial literacy. Programs to which he contributes to include the NASDAQ "Stock Market in Schools" Program, Boys and Girls Club, Providence Health Foundation, and the Montgomery County Community Foundation.
