Star Banc Corporation


# Star Banc Corporation



**Star Banc Corporation** was a Cincinnati, Ohio-based regional bank holding company that acquired Firstar in 1998 and took the Firstar name; the merged bank acquired U.S. Bancorp in 2001 and took the U.S. Bancorp name. The company can trace its origins back to 1863 when it was first founded as the First National Bank of Cincinnati.


## History

In Cincinnati, First National Bank of Cincinnati opened for business in 1863 under National Charter #24, the charter that U.S. Bancorp still operates under today.

In January 1974, to allow the company to expand outside of Cincinnati and to allow it to acquire other banks, the First National Bank of Cincinnati reorganized as a holding company, First National Cincinnati Corporation.

In July 1988, First National Cincinnati changed the names of all of its 17 subsidiary banks to Star Bank. In Columbus, Ohio State Bank was renamed Star Bank Central Ohio. The First National Bank of Cincinnati was renamed Star Bank, N.A., Cincinnati.

To be more consistent with the names of its subsidiary banks, the holding company changed its name to Star Banc Corporation the following year in April 1989.

Under the merger agreement, former Firstar board members would have 14 out of 32 directors seats on the board of the new corporation and could help control the direction of the new combined company. Star Banc was the nominal survivor, and the merged bank retained Star Banc's charter and stock price history. However, the merged bank would be based in Milwaukee under the Firstar name and inherited old Firstar's ticker symbol, FRS. It was also announced that Star Chairman and Chief Executive Jerry Grundhofer would become president and chief executive of the merged Firstar, while Firstar Chairman and Chief Executive Roger Fitzsimonds remained chairman of the merged company.

The merged bank took the U.S. Bancorp name and moved to Minneapolis. However, U.S. Bancorp retains Star Banc's pre-1998 stock price history, and operates under Star Banc's charter. It also claims Star Banc's founding in 1863 as its founding date.


## Sponsorships

Beginning in 1995, Star Banc Corporation started to sponsor the annual Star Bank LPGA Classic golf tournament that was held at the Country Club of the North in Beavercreek, Ohio. Corporate sponsorship continued after Star Banc acquired Firstar and changed the name of the bank to Firstar in late 1998; the golf tournament continued under the new Firstar name in 1999. Corporate sponsorship was dropped in 2001 after Firstar acquired U.S. Bancorp that same year.

In April 1997, Star Bank became the official bank of the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds replaced this sponsorship in August 2000 with a new business relationship with Provident Bank (through successive mergers, Provident became a part of National City and later PNC with each successor continuing the sponsorship).
