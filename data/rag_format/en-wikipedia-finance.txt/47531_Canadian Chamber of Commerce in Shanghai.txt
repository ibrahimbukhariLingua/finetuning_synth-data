# Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai



**The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai** (**CanCham Shanghai**) is a nonprofit organization and the only Canadian chamber of commerce in China. Its mission is to support Canadian businesses in East China by helping businesses develop their networks and marketing opportunities as well as to cultivate a thriving Canadian community in Shanghai.

The executive director and the staff of the Chamber are responsible for the daily operations of the Chamber. Matt Whately is the current executive director.


## History

Originally called the **Canadian Business Forum** (**CBF**), the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai was formed in 1996 by a group of locally based Canadian companies and entrepreneurs . In 2001, the CBF formed a partnership with the Canada China Business Council (CCBC) and was renamed the CCBC Shanghai Chapter. In the ensuing years, the CCBC Shanghai Chapter worked with the CCBC to develop the Canadian Business community in Shanghai and the Yangtze Delta Region at large while maintaining its operational independence and its identity as a non-profit business organisation. In June 2008, it was resolved and voted by the membership of the CCBC Shanghai Chapter to separate from the CCBC and establish the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. On June 18, 2008, The Canadian Chamber of Commerce was officially inaugurated in name.
