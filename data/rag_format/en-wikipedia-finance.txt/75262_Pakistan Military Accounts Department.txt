# Pakistan Military Accounts Department



**Pakistan Military Accounts Department** (**PMAD**) is an attached department of the Ministry of Defence. It is primarily responsible for making payments to the armed forces, maintaining its accounts and providing financial advice to the defense authorities.


## Functions

PMAD's primary responsibilities encompass the upkeep of Defence Services accounts, disbursing salaries & benefits to Commissioned Officers, JCOs/ORs, and civilians who are compensated from Defence Services Estimates. Additionally, it manages the auditing and payment processes for both local and imported stores, as well as the auditing and payment procedures related to Defence Services Works. PMAD also oversees internal auditing, the compilation of Defence Services receipts/expenditures, the creation of Appropriation Accounts, and the settlement of Railway and PIA Claims associated with the Defence Side. PMAD undertakes a dual role, that is, it handles both accounting and internal auditing tasks.


## Changes in pension payments

In November 2023, Pakistan Post announced that it would stop paying pensions to military accounts. This amount will be transferred to the banks from December 1. The decision was taken to meet the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) after it failed to digitize its accounts.


## Sports activities

PMAD also organizes sports activities. For example, during the Pakistan Military Accounts Department, a cricket match was played between Peshawar and Wah Cantt teams. Apart from this, Pakistan Military Accounts Sports Festival 2017 was inaugurated at Qayyum Stadium.


## Legal issues

In 2014, in a notable legal case, the Sindh High Court (SHC) suspended the notification proceedings regarding the transfer of the Controller of Naval Accounts.
