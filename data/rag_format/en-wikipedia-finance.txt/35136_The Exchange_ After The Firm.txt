Weeks later, of all people, Mitch's wife Abby is chosen as the receiver of the terrorists demands which is revealed to be the outrageous sum of $100 million for ransom - to be paid in less than ten days. Desperate, Mitch and Luca reach out to every possible asset. As the deadline comes closer, they realize they will not get all of the money in time.
