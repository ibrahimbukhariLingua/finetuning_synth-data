**Insider Inc.** (formerly **Business Insider Inc.**) is an American online media company known for publishing *Business Insider* and other media websites. It is a subsidiary of the German publisher Axel Springer SE, the largest in Europe.


## History

*Business Insider* was founded in 2007 by Henry Blodget and Kevin P. Ryan. In 2013, Jeff Bezos led an effort to raise US$5 million for Business Insider Inc. through his investment company Bezos Expeditions. On September 29, 2015, Axel Springer SE announced that it had acquired 88% of the stake in Business Insider Inc. for a reported US$343 million (â‚¬306 million). After the purchase, Axel Springer SE held a stake of approximately 97%, and Jeff Bezos held the remaining shares through Bezos Expeditions.

Business Insider Inc.'s name was changed to Insider Inc. in December 2017 as the company planned on becoming a general interest news publisher. Nicholas Carlson is Global Editor-in-Chief of Insider. In January 2018, the firm moved its global headquarters in New York City from the Flatiron District to the Financial District. In March 2018, it launched its first advertising campaign, with the tagline "Get in." The firm started using the Digital Content Ratings of Nielsen Holdings to measure its digital video audience in July 2018.
