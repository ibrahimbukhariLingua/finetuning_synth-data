Independent Music Companies Association


# Independent Music Companies Association



The **Independent Music Companies Association** (**IMPALA**), originally the **Independent Music Publishers and Labels Association**, is a non-profit trade association established in 2000 to help European independent record labels represent their agenda and promote independent music. Its offices are in Brussels, Belgium. IMPALA is a member of the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), a coalition of independent music bodies from countries throughout the world. In 2025, IMPALA started a new co-funded work programme as a European Union cultural network.


## History

IMPALA was founded in 2000 by national trade associations and key independent labels, as a non-profit organisation dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises in the music industry.

In 2008 an *Action Plan for Music* was launched and in 2010 an *Action Plan for Finance* was published.

In January 2015, IMPALA launched its *Digital Action Plan*, a ten-point plan calling for a new European industrial policy to drive the digital market through the cultural and creative sectors. The action plan calls on the EU to reinforce copyright, and other key measures, including promoting diversity in a measurable way and devising a new regulatory, competition, social and fiscal framework for smaller actors.

To celebrate IMPALA's 15th anniversary, from September 2015 various initiatives took place across Europe under the "IMPALA 15" banner, such as the Reeperbahn Festival at Hamburg, Germany.

In March 2016, IMPALA launched a monthly feature to put the spotlight on Europe's most inspiring young independent labels, known as the Young Label Spotlight.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
On 24 September 2018, Paul Pacifico, CEO of the UK's Association of Independent Music and Michel Lambot, co-founder and Co-President of the PIAS Group, co-represented IMPALA, the body representing European indie record labels, at the expert workshop organised by the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels (BOZAR), the European Cultural Foundation and the British Council about Brexit and the cultural sector. The goal was "to reaffirm our shared intent and common values, and to produce practical recommendations from the cultural and creative sectors that go beyond those that have already been made", and a list of recommendations was afterwards published on the IMPALA website.

As part of its role of representing independent music companies at EU level, IMPALA was involved in the discussions on the EU Copyright Directive, and is working on competition issues such as Sony's buyout of EMI in 2018, or the sale of Universal Music Group's shares.

In 2019 IMPALA acknowledged the climate emergency and committed to making the independent sector ecologically sustainable and regenerative, as well as using its voice to support Music Declares Emergency in Brussels.

In 2020, IMPALA established a COVID-19 Task Force and adopted a crisis plan, mapping tool and recovery package, as well as a set of second stage recommendations, helping culture to be recognised as one of Europe's fourteen priority sectors for recovery in the EU.

In October 2020 IMPALA adopted a Diversity and Inclusion Charter, a set of commitments dedicated to the European independent sector.

In November 2020, The organisation announced a year long series of podcasts, playlists and other projects to celebrate IMPALA's 20th birthday on a dedicated blog page.

In March 2021, IMPALA launched IMPALA Campus, an EU-funded training programme for recorded music professionals and self-releasing artists taking place spring and summer 2021 in partnership with four leading music conferences across Europe.

On 23 March 2021, IMPALA released a paper “It’s Time to Challenge the Flow: How to make the most of the real opportunities of streaming” and a ten-point plan with recommendations to music services to reform streaming.

The IMPALA sustainability task force developed a sustainability programme which was published in April 2021. The programme includes European independent music sector carbon goals for 2026 (net zero) and 2030 (net positive), along with a 15-commitment climate charter, voluntary tools, tips and guidance for members of the association.

In July 2021, IMPALA and IAO released a proposal for a GECAT Pass (for Geographical European Cultural Area Touring), with the idea to get small and medium sized music tours back on the road quickly and efficiently. The approach involves creating a new cultural area with a single touring permit, instead of treating Europe as a number of distinct blocs and countries.

In March 2022, IMPALA made a statement on the war in Ukraine and has been encouraging support for the Ukrainian culture sector together with other European cultural associations.

On 29 March 2022, IMPALA launched a new programme to boost diversity in the European independent music sector in partnership with YouTube called “100 Artists to Watch”. This new programme replaces IMPALA's annual European Independent Album of the Year Award, which had a great roll of 10 years.

In April 2022, the association and Julie's Bicycle have launched the first bespoke carbon calculator for the independent music sector. This was followed with the launch of IMPALA's Climate Training and Standards project IMPACTS. This EU funded project aims to build new climate literacy capacity for independent music companies across Europe to help them lower their carbon footprint.

In May 2022, during EU diversity month, IMPALA launched the Changemaker Award as part of its equity, diversity and inclusion work, the award aims to put the spotlight on projects that promote change in the independent sector and inspire others to take action. The first recipient of this new award is the POWER UP initiative, which supports Black music creators and industry professionals and executives, as well as addressing anti-Black racism and racial disparities in the music sector. Later in May, IMPALA released a report on the first diversity and inclusion survey of the independent sector, “Towards a more diverse and inclusive independent music sector” to close its programme for European Diversity Month.

In April 2023, IMPALA released its climate standards report which establishes a framework to start looking at how sector-wide benchmarks and standards might be developed. This was developed by IMPALA's own Climate Analysis Group with input and approval provided by climate experts represented by Thema1 and Julie’s Bicycle.

Following a month-long review process launched on the second anniversary of IMPALA’s ten-point streaming plan, the independent sector issued a new call to action in April 2023. Building on IMPALA’s initial recommendations to make streaming fairer and provide a dynamic, compelling, and responsible future for creators and fans, IMPALA’s new call was based on three key themes:

* Getting more money into the market and making sure there is no dilution of revenues.
* Changing how revenue is shared.
* Boosting diversity, transparency and climate action.

In September 2023, at the Vienna WAVES Festival and Conference, IMPALA elected a new board for a term of two years and reviewed the priorities of the association in the coming year. These include AI opportunities, streaming reform, fiscal support, growing the network in Central Eastern Europe and boosting sustainability and inclusion work.

Continuing its work on streaming reform, IMPALA raised concerns about the impact of a possible two-tier system involving the allocation of revenues, following proposals for reform by various streaming services.

At the end of 2023, while EU policymakers sought to reach a final agreement on the AI Act, the EU’s landmark proposal to regulate AI. IMPALA called on the EU institutions to support effective transparency and record keeping obligations on AI models. After a provisional agreement was found the week after, IMPALA praised the endorsement by EU member states, and subsequently the European Parliament in early 2024.

In April 2024, IMPALA called for an end to the "value gap" for Tiktok and other moment economy platforms and warned of the "unintended consequences" of proposed streaming reforms across digital service providers.

Ahead of the 2024 European Parliament Election, IMPALA joined artists and labels across Europe to call on the European Commission to come forward with a clear proposal to address the consequences of the EU “RAAP” case regarding terrestrial broadcast and public performance rights.

In April 2024, IMPALA joined the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN) in their renewed set of values as part of its ongoing work to promote the collective position of the sector in today’s evolving music landscape.

In May 2024, IMPALA joined WIN's call for a joined-up approach on GenAI around key principles promoting safety, transparency, respect for copyright, a human-centered approach, ethics, and cross border consistency.

At the end of European Diversity Month in May 2024, IMPALA announced Black & Irish as the third winner of the Changemaker Award 2024. Black & Irish were recognised for their advocacy for the black community in Ireland, fostering connections within Irish society and championing anti-racist ethos.
