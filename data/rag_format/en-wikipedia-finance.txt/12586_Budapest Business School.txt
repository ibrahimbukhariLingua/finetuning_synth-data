**Budapest University of Economics and Business** (BUEB) (Hungarian: *Budapesti Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem* [ˈbudɒpɛʃti ˈɡɒzdɒʃaːɡi ˈɛɟɛtɛm] (*BGE*); officially: Budapest University of Economics and Business (BUEB) is a public business school specializing in business studies and social sciences in Budapest, Hungary. It was founded in 1857 by the merchants and bankers of Austria-Hungary. It is the oldest public business school in the world, and the second oldest among all business schools, after the ESCP Business School in Paris.

BUEB is the largest business school in Hungary. It conducts education and research in areas such as leadership, economics, operations management, marketing, entrepreneurship, and organizational behavior. The school offers 12 bachelor's degree programs, usually in English, French, German, or Hungarian, and 12 master's degree programs, including Master of Finance, Master of Management (equivalent to an MBA), Master of International Business, and Master of Tourism Management. It also offers a PhD in Management and other post-graduate professional qualifications.


## History and traditions

BBS was founded in 1857 as the Pest Academy of Commerce, which is the official predecessor of the BBS faculties of the College of Finance and Accountancy and the College of Catering, Commerce and Tourism. It was the first business school in Austria-Hungary and Central Europe, and is the second oldest existing business school in the world, after the ESCP Europe. After the cities of Buda and Pest merged, the institution was renamed the Budapest Academy of Commerce.

Győző Czigler designed the Alkomány Street campus of the Budapest Academy of Commerce in 1882 and its construction was finished in 1885, when the construction of the Hungarian Parliament Building began next door. It is still one of the school's main campuses.

BBS's campus at Markó Street is also located in downtown Budapest, housed in a neoclassical building designed by Ferenc Kolbenheyer in 1872. Inside, the Lotz Room is full of paintings by Károly Lotz and Mór Than. Many of the conferences of the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union were held in this room and other lecture rooms on campus.

The Budapest Academy of Commerce was a private business school until 1949, when the government nationalized it and made it a public business school.

After being renamed several times, the College of Accountancy was established in 1953 and the College of Catering and Commerce was established in 1969. In January 2000, the individual colleges created BBS and became faculties of the university.

On December 16, 2024 the Hungarian Parliament approved an amendment to the national higher education law, reclassifying the BUEB from a "university of applied sciences" to the highest "university" status. This change, effective from February 1, 2025, will also include renaming the institution to Budapesti Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem (BGE).
