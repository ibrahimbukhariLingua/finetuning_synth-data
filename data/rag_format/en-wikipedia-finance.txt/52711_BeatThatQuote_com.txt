**BeatThatQuote.com** was a British price comparison site specializing in personal finance products. The site was disabled in 2013 after being acquired by Google.


## History

BeatThatQuote.com was launched by John Paleomylites in February 2005 based in London's Kentish Town. In the financial year 2006 to 2007 the company posted revenues of £7.8 million.

BeatThatQuote.com was ranked by Nielsen Online as the fastest growing UK website in 2007, was acquired by Google in March 2011 for £37.7 million. BeatThatQuote.com was penalised by Google for search engine spamming the day after it acquired it.

In turn, Google created **Google Compare** using some of the technology that they had acquired. However, this was not a success and it was closed in March 2016.


## Affiliations

As well as operating their own website, BeatThatQuote.com also provided the services for other comparison websites such as ArgosCompare.co.uk and other financial comparison websites.
