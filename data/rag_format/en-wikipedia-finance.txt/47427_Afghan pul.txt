**Afghan pul** *(plural: puls)*; **پول (Pashto); پل (Persian)** is the 1⁄100 (one-hundredth) subdivision of the Afghan afghani, which is the official currency of Afghanistan since the 1920s. All pul coins have been demonetized.


## History

Until the 1920s, the currency of Afghanistan was the Afghan rupee, which was subdivided into paisa. In 1923, the rupee was replaced by *afghani* as its official currency. One afghani is subdivided into 100 puls. At the time of introduction, a pul coin was made of copper and weighed one gram. However, a 10 pul coin weighed 6 grams.
