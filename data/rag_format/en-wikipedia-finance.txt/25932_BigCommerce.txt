## History

BigCommerce was founded in Sydney, Australia in 2009 by Australians Eddie Machaalani and Mitchell Harper, who met in an online chatroom in 2003.

The company raised $15 million in Series A funding from General Catalyst in July 2011.

In 2014, the company expanded its presence on the West Coast, opening a San Francisco office and hiring personnel from PayPal and Amazon. In 2015, BigCommerce acquired Zing, a checkout and inventory software startup.

BigCommerce partnered with Amazon in 2016 to provide its retailers with the capability to sync inventory across both channels.
