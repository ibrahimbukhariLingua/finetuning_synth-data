Platform imperialism


# Platform imperialism



**Platform imperialism** is term coined to describe the interactions of global digital platforms in the information economy. Several scholars have identified platform imperialism in political economy, critical cultural studies and media studies. It mainly argues that a few Western digital platforms, particularly American platforms, such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube, dominate the global cultural and technological spheres. Although several non-Western countries have developed their digital platforms, they don't control the global platform markets. Consequently, lop-sided power relations between Western and non-Western countries have remained unchanged. Unlike cultural imperialism theory, focusing on power relations between Western and non-Western countries by emphasizing cultural production in terms of the production of popular culture and the circulation of cultural content, the discourse on platform imperialism includes several core areas, such as intellectual property, the global digital divide, free labor, and the nation-state, focusing on the role of the nation-state alongside transnational capital. Digital platforms have been influential in capital accumulation and digital culture in the networked 21st century. Numerous digital platforms, such as smartphones, social media, and OTT (over-the-top) platforms, are crucial because they function as digital mediators. Platform imperialism refers to the asymmetrical power balances between a few Western countries as platform owners and many non-Western countries as platform users. The increasing dominance of Western platforms in the global cultural markets has been one of the most significant socio-cultural and economic concerns as digital platforms are some of the most influential entities in our contemporary society.


## Derivative platform imperialism

Based on the notion of platform imperialism, numerous scholars developed specific forms of platform imperialism, such as Netflix Imperialism, Facebook Imperialism, and Amazon's platform imperialism. For example, in the global cultural sphere in the early 21st century, Netflix has continued to rein supreme due in large part to its AI-supported algorithms and data as well as many cultural materials. Netflix has continued to develop original content while licensing cultural pgormas from other countries, therefore, it rapidly increases the number of paid-subscribers and, therefore, financial gains. Local OTT platforms in many countries cannot compete with Netflix due to the lack of cultural content and global networks. The tension between Netflix and local OTT platforms increases, but Netflix controls the entire OTT platform markets, consisting of Netflix imperialism.
