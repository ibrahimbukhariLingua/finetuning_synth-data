# Law on Financial Sector Development and Strengthening



The **Law on Financial Sector Development and Strengthening** is an omnibus law formulated by Joko Widodo administration aimed to develop and strengthen Indonesian financial sector. The law passed by the People's Representative Council on 15 December 2022.

Unlike the previous omnibus laws passed by Joko Widodo administration such as Omnibus Law on Job Creation, Law on State Capital, and 2023 Indonesian Criminal Code, this law is the first omnibus law made under mechanism prescribed in 2022 Law on Law Formulation.

As the law passed, Indonesia currently undergoes national economy transition for next 5 years after the law passed.

The law mandated Bank Indonesia to regulate the development, issue, and circulation of the Digital Rupiah.

Article 53 of the law mandated the LPS to expand their assurance coverage from covering only bank savings to include the insurance covering in case the insurance company going bankrupt and have problems. LPS will assure the insurance until the new Indonesia Insurance Assurance Corporation (LPP) formed by the mandate of the law, 5 years after the law promulgated.
