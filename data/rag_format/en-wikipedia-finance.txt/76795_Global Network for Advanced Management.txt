Global Network for Advanced Management


# Global Network for Advanced Management



The **Global Network for Advanced Management** is a collaboration of graduate schools of business that seeks to foster intellectual ties among business schools, students and deans from both economically strong regions and those on the horizon of economic development. It was founded by a consortium of 21 schools and launched on April 27, 2012.ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ The Global Network has since expanded to include 32 member schools.


## Objectives

The Global Network for Advanced Management was founded on the premise that enterprises need leaders who understand how markets and organizations work in increasingly diverse and complex contexts. The network provides an organizational structure to facilitate connections among faculty, students, and alumni from diverse regions, cultures, and economies in different phases of development. Chief goals are the exchange of ideas, collaboration on data collection, and the promotion of research in areas of interest to global commerce. Member schools share course materials, including case studies that incorporate specialized regional expertise.


## Activities

The Global Network is a platform for innovation, hosting programs that include Global Network Weeks, which give students at network schools the opportunity to travel to another Network school for a one-week intensive mini-course that takes advantage of localized expertise; Global Network Courses, online graduate-level business courses that connect students at member schools in group project work; and Global Network cases, teaching materials that examine business challenges from the points of view of at least two Global Network regions.

In January 2014, as part of the “Business + Society: Leadership in an Increasingly Complex World,” conference, which marked the opening of Edward P. Evans Hall, the new home for the Yale School of Management, deans and directors from nine Global Network schools discussed the skills they believed critical to leaders with moderator Margaret Warner in a panel entitled "Preparing Leaders for a Flatter World." Faculty, deans, and students from three network schools participated in "Bank of Ireland: A Raw Case Study" with American investor Wilbur Ross.

As of 2023, more than 14,500 students have participated in a Global Network Week and more than 6,500 have taken one of the Small Network Online Courses (SNOCs). More than 5,000 students from 20 of the member schools have participated in the Global Virtual Teams course.
