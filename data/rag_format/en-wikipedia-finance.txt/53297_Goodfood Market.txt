The service grew in popularity and began enrolling hundreds of subscribers per week. One of the Company's early adopters was Anne-Marie Withenshaw, a television and radio personality. Withenshaw eventually endorsed Goodfood and helped it grow in popularity across Quebec and Canada.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Rebranding to Goodfood

In 2016, the company rebranded itself under the name Goodfood.


### Going public

In June 2017, Goodfood became publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The transaction, completed through a form of reverse takeover, raised $21 million of capital. The funds raised were earmarked for growth and were used in large part to expand Goodfood's subscriber base and facility size. After the closing of the transaction, Goodfood began trading on the TSX under the ticker FOOD. The Company later raised additional equity to expand to Calgary, a second facility in Montreal and a new facility in Vancouver.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
