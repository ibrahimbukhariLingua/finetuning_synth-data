## Career


### Asian media

In 1993, Brack was one of the first employees at Turner Broadcasting System's Hong Kong location. He also managed Time Inc.'s *Asiaweek* and became the company's senior vice president in Asia. After Time Inc. shuttered *Asiaweek* in 2001 due to financial losses and an ensuing retrenchment effort, Brack stated: "'We had a plan, and the plan was working up until the middle of this year... Then we got struck by lightning. Nobody could have predicted the severity of this downturn.'' Specifically, Brack cited an existing economic slowdown in Asia paired with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Shortly afterward, he was promoted to senior vice president of ad sales at *Time* and *Fortune* in Asia. Brack also later served as an executive at Time Warner where he helped launch Cartoon Network in Asia.


### Media consolidation in Asia

In 2003, Brack co-founded and became the CEO of Redgate Media Holdings, a consolidated media company based in China. He stated that Redgate "was principally an investment company" and "its role following any acquisition would therefore be primarily strategic in nature" with regard to the media market in Asia. As such, he closed deals on and acquired numerous titles, publications, and local media companies with the goal of establishing a "network of partner companies to provide seamless deals for advertisers." In 2004, Redgate partnered on a venture with Ming Pao Enterprise Corp. It merged with Inno-Tech Holdings in 2013.

In 2004, Brack co-founded and became the CEO of One Media Holdings, a Hong Kong-based magazine publisher that operated in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan. It served as the "magazine arm" of Ming Pao Enterprise Group. There, Brack oversaw the release of publications such as Chinese editions of Popular Science, Top Gear, T3, and others publicationsâ€”in Hong Kong specifically, One Media Holdings published titles like Ming Pao Weekly, *City Children Weekly*, and *Hi Tech Weekly*. In 2008, Media Chinese International became the major shareholder of One Media Holdings.

Both Redgate Media Holdings and One Media Holdings went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.


### Venture capital

Brack was a venture partner and executive-in-residence at Mucker Capital, a firm based in Los Angeles, as well as a chairman of Nest Ventures and a vice chairman of the Medici Network. Brack is also one of six founding and managing partners at Hypothesis Ventures, a firm investing in early-stage startup companies in Opportunity Zones.
