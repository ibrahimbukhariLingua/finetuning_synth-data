## Blog

Eldon maintains a blog, where he gives (sometimes controversial) opinions on political topics. In 2014, Eldon attracted attention after posting comments about Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, and saying that pro-democracy protesters should "move on from the current impasse" during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. This had led to HSBC feeling the need to comment that the views expressed were his own, and not a company view on the matters.


## Personal life

Born in Inverness, Scotland, Eldon was educated at the Duke of York's Royal Military School. Eldon married in 1975 and has three children. Two of his children are living and working in Hong Kong, while the other lives and works in Canberra, Australia.
