# Malaysia–Taiwan relations



**Malaysia–Taiwan relations** refers to bilateral foreign relations between Malaysia and Republic of China (Taiwan). The economic and the cultural relations are still maintained with Malaysia having a trade centre office in Taipei, and Taiwan has an economic and cultural centre in Kuala Lumpur.


## History

Relations were established in 1964, when Taiwan opened its Consulate in Kuala Lumpur. This was upgraded to a Consulate-General five years later.

However, in 1974, Malaysia established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, leading to the closure of the Malaysian Consulate in Taipei.

An office of Malaysia Airlines in Taipei represented Malaysia's interests in Taiwan until 1982. In 1983, a Trade Office was opened, leading to the establishment of the "Friendship and Trade Exchange Centre", before it adopted its present name in 1987.

In order to represent its interests, Taiwan established the "Far East Travel and Trade Centre". This was upgraded in 1988, and renamed the "Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre". It adopted its present name in 1992.


## Economic relations

The total reached $9.48 billion in 2004, with Malaysian exports worth around $5.4 billion and Taiwanese exports at US$4 billion. In 2012, Malaysia was the 8th largest trading partner for Taiwan with the total trade amounted to $15.2 billion while Taiwan became the 10th largest foreign investor in Malaysia with the total investments worth around $2.0 billion. Most of the trade between the two countries was based on liquefied natural gas (LNGs) and electrical machinery and equipment.

During the visit of Taiwanese Vice-president Lien Chan to Malaysia in 1998, the country decided to collect $100 million from all of the Taiwanese enterprises in the country to save some local enterprises which were near to collapse.

The country also provided $100 million to $1 billion to help Malaysia recover from the impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Also during the 1997 Southeast Asian haze, the Taiwanese authorities donated more than 100,000 respirators to Malaysia.

Early in 2014, Taiwan joined the search or MH370 where one of the airline passenger was a Taiwanese citizen.

## Controversy


### Deportation of Taiwanese fraud suspects into Mainland China

On 30 April 2016, 32 of 117 suspects arrested in relation to transnational telecom fraud are being deported to China after first batch of 20 suspects from Malaysia has been deported into Taiwan. This was after another 45 Taiwanese citizens has been deported by the Kenyan government to China for the similar case. Taiwan's cabinet spokesperson Sun Lih-chyun believe that "Malaysia sending the remaining Taiwanese suspects into China was due to the continuous "pressure from Beijing" that maintains all the suspects must be sent to Mainland China. Another 21 suspects were deported to China on 29 November, which also being done by Armenia earlier resulting to protests from Taiwanese citizens. Its Foreign Ministry expressed regret over the recent move and stern opposition to Malaysia's decision to deport Taiwanese to mainland China. In a statement, they said:

> This action by Malaysia has seriously harmed the rights of our citizens and harms the long standing friendship between Taiwan and Malaysia.
