| 8,408 | 9,417 | 8,461 |


## Environment

In 2020, three Metinvest enterprises Ilyich Steel, Azovstal and Pokrovske Coal were among the top ten environmental polluters in Ukraine.

Metinvest was the first Ukrainian member of the World Steel Association, which demands that its members comply with the principles of environmentally responsible business.

To reduce the environmental impact in Mariupol, Metinvest decommissioned the open-hearth furnace production at Azovstal in 2011 and at Ilyich Steel in 2015. In 2012, three obsolete coke batteries at Azovstal were also decommissioned and the sinter plant was mothballed. In 2020, Metinvest completed the reconstruction of the sinter plant gas treatment facilities at Ilyich Steel at a cost of over $160 million. The new treatment system was designed to reduce dust emissions by 90% and sulphur oxide emissions by 43%.

In 2015, Zaporizhstal completed construction of a new hydrochloric acid pickling line with a pickling liquor regeneration unit. The cost of the project was about $77 million. After the launch of the line, the plant completely stopped discharging used pickling solutions into the Dnipro River.

In 2019, Azovstal reconstructed the aspiration system in the foundry yard and under-bunker rooms of blast furnace No. 3. The cost of the project was over $14 million. Air emissions were reduced by 88% and met European environmental standards.

In 2017, Northern GOK replaced the gas cleaning equipment of the Lurgi 552-B roasting machine. The project, costing about $14 million, made it possible to achieve emission concentrations of up to 50 mg per cubic metre, which meets Ukrainian environmental standards.

In 2011–2020, Metinvest allocated $3.5 billion to projects with an environmental component and $1 billion to purely environmental projects. In 2021 the group stated its intention to invest another $0.5 billion in environmental projects over the next five years.

In 2011–2020, environmental investments enabled the group to reduce emissions of pollutants by 37%, including a 51% reduction in dust emissions and a 45% reduction in emissions to water bodies.
