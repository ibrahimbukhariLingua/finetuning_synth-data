In October 2014, however, it was announced that the EU's antitrust regulators had opened an extensive investigation into Zimmer's bid for Biomet due to concern that it would substantially lessen competition in certain markets. In March 2016, European Commission (“EC”) conditionally cleared Zimmer's proposed acquisition of Biomet, Inc. and on June 24, 2015, Zimmer completed its acquisition of Biomet forming Zimmer Biomet Holdings.
