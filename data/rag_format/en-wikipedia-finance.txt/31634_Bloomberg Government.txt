# Bloomberg Government



**Bloomberg Government** is a division of Bloomberg Industry Group that provides data-driven decision tools, news, and analytics in a digital workspace for professionals who influence government action.


## History

Bloomberg Government launched in 2011 as a comprehensive solution to eliminate multiple government information resources. According to *The New York Times*, the service was developed to provide news and information about politics, along with the less "glamorous" aspects of government reporting, including legislative and regulatory coverage.

The first stages of what is now Bloomberg Government began in 2009, when a team led by Chris Walters and Don Baptiste spent most of the year researching to find a solution to match market needs, and after two years of market sizing, the product was launched. Bloomberg Government is now used by Congressional offices, trade associations, federal contractors, lobbyists, and corporate government-affairs professionals.

On April 6, 2017, Bloomberg L.P. announced that Bloomberg Government will become part of Bloomberg BNA.


## Staff

Bloomberg implemented an aggressive recruiting strategy to staff Bloomberg Government in Washington, DC, which included hiring industry analysts, political staff, product developers, and a business development team. The business is currently organized in two primary segments focused on serving government-affairs professionals and federal contractors, respectively.

Arielle Elliott serves as the head of Bloomberg Government.
