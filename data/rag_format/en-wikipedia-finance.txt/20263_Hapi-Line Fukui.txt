Hapi-Line Fukui


# Hapi-Line Fukui



**Hapi-Line Fukui** (株式会社ハピラインふくい, *Kabushiki-gaisha Hapirain Fukui*) is a Japanese third-sector railway company established in 2019 that operates passenger railway services on the section of the former JR West Hokuriku Main Line that lay within Fukui Prefecture. This section of the Hokuriku Main Line was separated from the JR West network on 16 March 2024, coinciding with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen extension from Kanazawa to Tsuruga, and Hapi-Line Fukui trains began operation on that day.


## History

In preparation for the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen extension between Kanazawa and Tsuruga stations, the company was founded on 13 August 2019 to inherit the parallel section between Tsuruga and Daishōji stations on the Hokuriku Main Line. Its headquarters are located in the city of Fukui, Fukui Prefecture.

Shares in the company are owned by Fukui Prefecture, the cities of Fukui and Tsuruga, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency, and private-sector businesses.

Hapi-Line Fukui paid JR West ¥7 billion (US$63.78 million) to purchase the station buildings, tracks, and rolling stock. At this time, the company announced an expected annual income of ¥1.8 billion, primarily from passenger fares. As of April 2024, 75% of Hapi-Line Fukui's income comes from commuter passes, including student passes. JR Freight continue to pays the company track usage fees for over 30 freight trains per day. Long-term, the company aims for a stable annual revenue of ¥4 billion.

Along with the takeover from JR, Hapi-Line Fukui introduced rapid trains, and increased the number of trains running on the line from 102 to 132.

The company has collaborated with other railways in the prefecture, namely Echizen Railway and Fukui Railway (Fukutetsu), to consolidate purchasing and construction contracts, saving an estimated 5% .


## Hapi-Line Fukui Line

On 16 March 2024, Hapi-Line Fukui took over control of local passenger operations on the 84.3 km (52.4 mi) section JR West Hokuriku Main Line between Daishōji and Tsuruga, with 20 stations (although Tsuruga Station remains under the control of JR West, Daishōji was transferred to IR Ishikawa Railway). In addition, a new service type called "Rapid" was introduced on that same day, which operates during peak hours between Tsuruga and Fukui and stops at major stations along the route. From the time of takeover on 16 March 2024, 5 northbound trips and 4 southbound trips of Rapid Service are operated daily.

Some Hapi-Line Fukui trains provide through-service to the IR Ishikawa Railway Line, which continue on to Kanazawa Station.
