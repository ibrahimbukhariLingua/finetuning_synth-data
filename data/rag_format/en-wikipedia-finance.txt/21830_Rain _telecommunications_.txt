## Controversies


### Ban claiming “Unlimited Data 24/7 on 5G”

In August 2020, the advertising appeal committee of the advertising regulatory bureau banned rain from claiming unlimited 5G 24/7 after receiving multiple complaints from the public.


### Spectrum arrangements

in October 2021, Telkom has approached Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) to report spectrum arrangements between competitors Vodacom and Rain. Telkom argues Vodacom’s ability to control Rain’s spectrum entrenches its position as a dominant player in a highly concentrated market. An investigation is still underway.
