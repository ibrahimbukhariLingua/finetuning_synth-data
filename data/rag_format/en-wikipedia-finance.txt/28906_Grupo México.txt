Grupo México


# Grupo México



**Grupo México** is a Mexican conglomerate that operates through the following divisions: Mining (Minera Mexico), Transportation (GMxT), Infrastructure and Fundacion Grupo Mexico.

Founded in 1978, Grupo México became a significant player in the mining industry, responsible for 87.5 percent of Mexico's copper production by 2000. The company has faced ongoing conflict with the Mexican Mine Workers' Union and acquired a controlling interest in Southern Peru Copper Corporation in 2004. A litigation over the equity sale of SPCC is ongoing, with Grupo México's $2.5 billion bid for ASARCO recommended for acceptance in 2009.

The company is the largest mine operator in Mexico and Peru, and the third largest in the United States. It is the fourth largest copper producer worldwide and controls the largest copper reserves globally.

Grupo México operates the second largest transportation division in Mexico and the U.S. states of Texas and Florida, owning several entities that collectively operate over 11,000 kilometers of track, connecting major cities, ports, and border crossings, and manage 40 intermodal freight facilities across Mexico.

ASARCO has been held responsible for environmental pollution at 20 Superfund sites across the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency. Grupo México, ASARCO's owner, has also faced environmental issues in Mexico, including a sulfuric acid spill into the Sea of Cortés, the Pasta de Conchos mine disaster, and the Rio Sonora spill. Despite these incidents, Grupo México reported a decrease in total CO2e emissions for the year ending December 2020.


## History

The company was founded by Raúl Antonio Escobedo and Larrea Mota Velasco in 1978. After the government of Carlos Salinas declared the state mining company bankrupt, Larrea purchased key Mexican copper mines in Cananea and Nacozari (cities in the state of Sonora). He also purchased numerous other mining sites, including coal mines in the state of Coahuila. By 2000, Grupo México was responsible for 87.5 percent of Mexico's copper production and is the world's third-largest copper producer.

Grupo México has been in continual conflict with Local 65, the Cananea branch of the Mexican Mine Workers' Union (SNTMMSRM). During miners' strikes in January 2003 and October 2004, Grupo México responded with threats to close the Cananea mines.

In 2004, Grupo México purchased a controlling interest in the Southern Peru Copper Corporation. Grupo Mexico acquired 54.2% equity interest in Southern Peru Copper Corporation from ASARCO LLC, a mining company operating in the United States. The SPCC equity sale is subject to a litigation between Grupo Mexico and ASARCO pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas under District Court Judge Andrew Hanen. As of September 2009, ASARCO was the focus of a bidding war begun in May 2008 between its own parent company Grupo México and India-based Sterlite Industries. On August 31, 2009, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard Schmidt recommended that U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen accept Grupo México's $2.5 billion bid for ASARCO as it prepares to come out of bankruptcy.

### Cases in Mexico


#### Sea of Cortés acid spill

On July 9, 2019, 3,000 liters of sulfuric acid spilled into the Sea of Cortés from Grupo México-owned pipes near the city of Guaymas, in northwestern Mexico. Three people were injured, and videos appeared online documenting the "sad and harrowing" local damage to marine wildlife as a consequence of the spill.


#### Pasta de Conchos mine disaster

On February 19, 2006, an explosion occurred in a coal mine in San Juan de Sabinas, Coahuila, that is owned by Grupo México.
It was reported that mine workers had gone on strike against Grupo México at least 14 times, "not only for salary increases… but because of its constant refusal to review security and health measures." Grupo México said that they, in conjunction with the mining union, signed a certificate on February 7, 2006, declaring the mine safe.

Although the mining operations of a coal deposit is always a risky business, due to the possibility of huge gas concentrations, there are certain theories that indicate the mine has an important lack of safety rules, very similar to the problem presented in the Sago Mine disaster in West Virginia with the accident that caused death of 12 miners on January 2, 2006. Union critics of the company openly refer to the incident as a "homicide."

After the successful rescue of 33 trapped miners in October 2010 in Copiapó, Chile, the case gained popularity again, and many people including bishop Raúl Vera demanded that the case be reopened. Grupo México has not responded.

According to the IndustriALL Global Union, as of August 2016, "Ten years after the mining homicide at Pasta de Conchos, Mexico, the government has still not conducted a thorough investigation into the real causes of the disaster, brought those responsible to justice, recovered the bodies or compensated the families of the victims."


#### Rio Sonora spill

On August 6, 2014, 40,000 cubic meters of copper sulphate were spilled on Sonora River and Bacanuchi River by Buenavista del Cobre mine. This has been considered the largest environmental spillage in Mexico's history, polluting 7 municipal districts from Sonora state and affecting by October more than 20,000 people. Pollution has been reported to be reaching Arizona.
Though a trust fund was created to assist the damaged population, complains about its management and proper ecological cleaning have been expressed.
A second spillage, this time sulfur dioxide, was reported.


### Carbon footprint

Grupo México reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 5,810 Kt (-560 /-8.8% y-o-y). This follows a 19% reduction in 2019.
