Department of Prices and Consumer Protection


# Department of Prices and Consumer Protection



The **Department of Prices and Consumer Protection** was a short-lived United Kingdom government department created by the incoming Labour government in 1974 when the functions of the Department of Trade and Industry were divided between three new departments (the Department of Trade, the Department of Industry and the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection). In 1979 the department was abolished by the new Conservative government and its responsibilities were re-integrated into the Department of Trade.
