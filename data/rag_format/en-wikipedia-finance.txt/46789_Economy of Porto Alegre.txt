Participatory Budgeting is a democratic decision-making process allowing citizens to allocate the public budget. This concept originated in Porto Alegre, hence has historical significance to the city. Participatory budgeting was established in 1989 under the leadership of Olivio Dutra, this concept is built on 3 principles that are as follows:

1. "All citizens are entitled to participate;
2. Participation is governed by a combination of direct and representative democracy rules and takes place through regularly functioning institutions whose internal rules are decided upon by the participants;
3. Investment resources are allocated according to an objective method based on a combination of 'general criteria' and 'technical criteria'."

These principles are reflective of the democratic nature of this system. 2,700 governments have adopted the practice since the origination of the concept in Porto Alegre.

The benefits of Participatory Budgeting have been seen in many areas where this system is put in place; however, the benefits in the first 10 years of its implementation in Porto Alegre show strong results. Data from a case study by the World Bank shows the following results:

* An increase in public housing units; originally having only 1,700 new residents in 1986 à after the implementation of Participatory budgeting housing an additional 27,000 in 1989.
* Before Participatory Budgeting, only 75% of the households had sewer and water connections, increasing to 98% of total households by 1997.
* The number of has schools in the city by 1986 increased by 300%.
* The budget allocation for health and education increased from 13% to just shy of 40% in the first 10 years of the implementation of Participatory Budgeting.
