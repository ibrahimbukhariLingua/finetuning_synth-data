Heller Ehrman


# Heller Ehrman



**Heller Ehrman LLP** was an international law firm of more than 730 attorneys in 15 offices in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Heller Ehrman was founded in San Francisco in 1890 and had additional offices located in most of the major financial centers around the world including New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., London, Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore.

In September 2008, the firm encountered troubles after losing 15 intellectual property (IP) partners to Covington & Burling, which led to the collapse of merger talks with Mayer Brown on 14 September 2008. Including the above 15, a total of 50 partners had left the firm in 2008.
One anonymous legal market expert said the exit of the IP partners could constitute a default in Heller’s line of credit with its bank, effectively triggering liquidation.

On September 25, 2008, the firm confirmed its dissolution would occur on November 28, 2008. The firm filed a voluntary petition for chapter 11 bankruptcy for protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California on December 28, 2008.

Following the firm's bankruptcy, the firm's trustee had a dispute with the firm's former partners as to whether the firm or the individual partners are entitled to revenue from client matters pending at the time of bankruptcy. The dispute reached the California Supreme Court in 2016.


## History and notable cases

Heller Ehrman had its beginning in 1890 when Emanuel S. Heller opened his law practice at 124 Sansome Street, Room 30, in San Francisco, California. Heller was a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, received his law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law and passed the California Bar in 1889. In 1891, he became the primary attorney of banker Isaias W. Hellman and moved his office to the headquarters of Hellman's Nevada Bank (Heller married Hellman's daughter in 1899). In 1896, Frank Hubbard Powers joined with Heller and the partnership name changed to **Heller & Powers**. In 1905, Sidney M. Ehrman (married to Isaias W. Hellman's other daughter Florence) and also a graduate of Berkeley (Class of 1896) and Hastings, entered into partnership with Heller and Powers, forming **Heller Powers & Ehrman**. In 1921, Jerome White and Florence McAuliffe joined the partnership after the death of Francis Powers, establishing the firm as **Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe LLP**. The firm retained this name for more than 84 years until the name was shortened in 2005.

Between the years 1974 to 2007, Heller Ehrman realized an increase in business, causing the firm to branch out from the west coast with an additional 12 offices in locations ranging from London to Singapore. In 1986 the San Francisco headquarters was moved to a new skyscraper at 333 Bush Street. By 1991, the firm had 370 lawyers, over 3.5 times the number it had employed just ten years earlier.

In 1993, the first advertisement ever sold on the Internet was sold on the Global Network Navigator (now America On-Line) to Heller Ehrman LLP, and in 1994, Heller Ehrman launched the first law firm website.

By 2007, the firm had over 730 lawyers, over twice the number it employed just 15 years earlier. During the 2006 fiscal year it more than doubled its gross revenue from just 10 years earlier to a level just north of half a billion dollars.
