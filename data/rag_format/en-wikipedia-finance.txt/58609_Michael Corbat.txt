### Issues addressed

In 2018 *The New York Times* wrote that "where Mr. Corbat can steer Citigroup directly, he is doing so." The issues he addressed included:

* Gender pay gap which he both defended, proclaiming that it inspires entry-level employee to work harder and advance, and concurrently described as "a challenge we need to tackle together."
* Bricks and Clicks, which *Fortune Magazine* described as "a broad physical branch network that caters to Baby Boomers and a robust online (and mobile) presence for Generation X and Millennials."

### Leaving Citi

Corbat's annual salary was cut 21% as he was on his way out. His pay cut and departure happened after the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) fined Citigroup $400 million for its mismanagement.
