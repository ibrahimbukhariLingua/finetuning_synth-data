Paris School of Economics


# Paris School of Economics



The **Paris School of Economics** (**PSE**; French: *École d'économie de Paris*) is a French research institute in the field of economics. It offers MPhil, MSc, and PhD level programmes in various fields of theoretical and applied economics, including macroeconomics, econometrics, political economy and international economics.

PSE is a brainchild of the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS, where the students are enrolled primarily), the École Normale Supérieure, the École des Ponts and University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne, and it is physically located on the ENS campus of *Jourdan* in the 14th *arrondissement* of Paris. It was founded in 2006 as a coalition of universities and *grandes écoles* to unify high-level research in economics across French academia, and was first presided by economist Thomas Piketty.

Since its foundation it has gained a certain amount of academic weight, and according to a ranking released by project RePEc in May 2020, it was ranked as the fifth-best university-level economics department in the world and first in Europe. Paris School of Economics' ranking has consistently risen since it was listed on the rankings on RePEc.


## Status

Created in December 2006, the Paris School of Economics has the status of *fondation reconnue d’utilité publique* (a Public interest foundation). This status allows PSE to draw on both public and private funding.

PSE is one of the "Fondation de Coopération Scientifique" (Scientific Research Foundations), a new type of foundation created by the Government to develop centres of excellence in France. Scientific Research Foundations operate according to the same rules as Public interest foundations.

* The Paris School of Economics is administered by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives of the public and private partners, researchers, and outside personalities.
* The Scientific Council consists of international researchers, external to PSE, of whom at least 50% work abroad. The Scientific Council evaluates the quality of both current and proposed teaching and research programmes. 3 Nobel Prizes laureates are members of the PSE Scientific Council.

## Degree programs

The foundation offers teaching through four Master programmes (APE, PPD, EDCBA, and Economics & Psychology) and a PhD Economics programme (within EDE-EPS).


### Master's programs

* Master APE: Analysis and Policy in Economics
* Master PPD: Public Policy and Development
* Master EDCBA: Economic Decision and Cost-Benefit Analysis
* Master Economics and Psychology

## PSE in international rankings

Its contributory economics faculties, including the Ecole Normale Superieure, École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, the Ecole Polytechnique and ENSAE, are ranked between the top 13 among 53 departments worldwide by publication output of the top five scholars. According to the global economics departments ranking released in May 2020 by RePEc, Paris School of Economics was ranked at **5th worldwide**, **1st in Europe**.
