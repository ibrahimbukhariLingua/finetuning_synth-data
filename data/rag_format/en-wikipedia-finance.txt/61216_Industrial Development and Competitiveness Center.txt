Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center


# Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center



The **Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center** (also known as **PROINDUSTRIA**) is a Dominican corporation that serves as a regulatory and representative body of every project, plan and actions of the Industrial Sector of the Dominican Republic, with the goal of making it competitive.

PROINDUSTRIA, which was born under the Competitiveness and Industrial Innovation Law (No. 392-07 of December 4, 2007), has as its main objective the competitive development of the national manufacturing industry, proposing policies and supporting programs to prompt the industrial renovation and innovation, industrial chain, diversification, and linking to international markets.


## Background

The Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center was born under the Law No. 5009 dated May 19, 1962, by the name of Industrial Development Corporation (CFI). This corporation was created in order to manage the assets and capital of companies after the fall of the regimen of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo in May 1961. Its main objective was to promote the industrial development of the country, stimulating the productive sectors of the national economy, with the exclusion of the agriculture and the sugar industry. These companies then became the Dominican Corporation of State Companies (CORDE). To this end, the CFI promoted the establishment of new industries in order to achieve diversification and systematization of productive activities, raising the standard of living of the population.

Meanwhile, the CFI promoted the establishment of new industries with the goal of achieving diversification, by supporting small and medium industrial enterprises through financing programs with their own resources and through a fund called FIDE (Fund-Bank Finance and Development Central). The CFI also built and developed the Herrera and Haina industrial parks. In the early 70s, by Executive order, the CFI started to build, develop and operate industrial parks in the free economic zone, to promote the export of goods and services.

The organizational and functional structure of the Industrial Development Corporation was the foundation for the emergence of the Industrial Development and Competitiveness Center in 2007.
