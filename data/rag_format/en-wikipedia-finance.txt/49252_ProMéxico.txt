ProMéxico


# ProMéxico



**ProMéxico** is a trust fund of the Federal government of Mexico —a subdivision of the Secretariat of Economy— that promoted international trade and investment. ProMéxico used to be in charge of the country's active participation in the international arena by firmly establishing Mexico as an attractive, safe and competitive destination for foreign investment; encouraging the exportation of national products and supporting the internationalization of Mexican companies; providing specialized advisory services to boost the export of products and services and increasing the presence of Mexican businesses abroad, and guiding the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.

ProMéxico had a network of 48 offices in 31 countries with sizeable economies that accounted for more than 70% of the world gross domestic product. In Mexico, 30 offices provided the public with a wide range of services and support.


## History

On June 1, 2007 the then President of Mexico, Felipe de Jesús Calderón Hinojosa, along with several federal secretaries, signed the decree ordering the establishment of ProMéxico as a “State-owned public trust fund,” for an initial term of fifty years, with the right to revoke its term at any time according to the applicable provisions.
Representing the Presidency, Eduardo Sojo Garza Aldape—the Secretary of Economy at that time—inaugurated the XXIV National Convention of Retail Trade (XXIV Convención Nacional del Comercio Detallista) ANTAD 2007 and announced the creation of ProMéxico, “trade and investment, that will be the new window to open markets and promote foreign trade and investment.”
