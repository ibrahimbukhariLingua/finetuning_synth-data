**Retail Zoo** is an Australian company. It is the owner of multiple major restaurant chains, including Boost Juice, Bettyâ€™s Burgers, Cibo Espresso, Salsa's Fresh Mex Grill.

It is a private company valued at around half a billion dollars. The company has explored a public listing on at least two occasions, first exploring and then putting on pause the idea in 2019; before resuming its pursuit of an IPO again in 2022. In February 2023, Australian private equity firm Adamantem Capital acquired a majority stake in the company for $350 million.


## History

Retail Zoo was founded by Janine and Jeff Allis in 2000. A majority stake was later sold to private equity investor Riverside Company. In 2014 Riverside's shareholding was purchased by Bain Capital. During this time, it explored a public listing on the ASX in 2019, but the listing ultimately didn't go ahead that year; and remained owned by Bain. In 2022 the company lodged documents with the Australian Securities & Investments Commission to change its status to a public company. However, it was later acquired by Australian private equity firm Adamantem Capital following a $225m capital raise through debt syndication by the Commonwealth Bank.

Its reported valuation history is as follows:
