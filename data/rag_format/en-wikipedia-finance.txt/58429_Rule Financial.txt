# Rule Financial



**Rule Financial** was a British multinational company based in London, UK, that provided business consulting, technical consulting and IT services to investment banks, asset and wealth management and related financial institutions. Their consultants were experienced across the wholesale and investment banking domains. They were established in the key financial centres of London, New York, Boston and Toronto, and employed over 810 people worldwide in 2014. In addition to these offices, Rule Financial had specialist development centres in Poland and Costa Rica, servicing European and North American markets.

GFT Technologies AG announced the acquisition of Rule Financial in June 2014 which was merged by the end of 2014.


## History

Marcus Rule founded the eponymous Rule Financial in 1997 and established the company headquarters in the City of London. His vision was to build a specialist business and technology consultancy serving the needs of the global investment banking community.
The business quickly grew, ultimately leading to the opening of two development centres in 2008 in Barcelona and Łódź (Poland), driven by the acquisition of Polish-based company Peer-to-Peer Systems. By 2010 Rule Financial had outgrown their London offices for the second time and moved to a new space in the heart of the City, in the same year that they were recognised in The Sunday Times Tech Track 100 for the fourth time since their inception. Growth was not confined to Rule Financial's London office, and in 2011 the Polish office expanded and moved to larger premises, reflecting overall global growth.

Subsequent expansion includes new offices in the important financial centres of Boston and Toronto (following the acquisition of The Waterline Group), whilst the addition of a second development centre, located in Poznań, underlined the company's commitment to Poland as an excellent IT nearshore location and it is currently home to more than 250 of their employees. The eighth and most recent Rule Financial office opened in early October 2013 in Heredia, Costa Rica to provide support to their clients in North America.
