Your Money


# Your Money



***CNN Money***, formerly known as ***In the Money***, ***Your $$$$$***, and ***Your Money*** is a thirty-minute news show last hosted by Christine Romans broadcast by CNN from the Time Warner Center studios in New York City. The business program was a week-in-review of that week's financial stories, with analysis of consumer impact from those stories; it was the final CNN program with an exclusive business focus. The show was formerly hosted by Ali Velshi before his move to Al Jazeera America. The program was last shown on Saturdays at 2:00 pm EST.

The show was renamed on June 7, 2014 to coincide with the launch of the new CNNMoney.com. It was canceled in October 2014.
