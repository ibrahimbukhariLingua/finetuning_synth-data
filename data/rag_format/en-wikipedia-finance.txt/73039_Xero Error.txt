## Production

Production on Xero Error commenced in November 2009 and completed by March 2010 . Xero Error is UAE's first film produced using computer-generated imagery. It is also the first film for production company Xpanse CGI, which has worked previously in commercial advertising. In December 2008, Xpanse officials were in Houston, in attempts to raise the financing to cover the budget.

Volunteers from social media channels were enlisted to complete the film. Actors were auditioned after a Twitter and Facebook campaign.
