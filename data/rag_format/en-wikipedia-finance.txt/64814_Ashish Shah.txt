## Career

### Pepperfry

In 2011, Ashish Shah decided to leave his job as business head of eBay Motors and start his own business. While searching for furniture makers for his new online furniture store, he discovered Appu Arts. Despite being new to the furniture business, he had a knack for finding the right sellers. In January 2012, Ashish Shah and his business partner, Ambareesh Murty, founded Pepperfry with 12 team members. They chose the name for its distinct Indian identity and a touch of fun. Initial funding of $5 million came from Niren Shah, the Managing Director of Norwest Venture Partners India (NVP). In 2014, Pepperfry secured a $15 million investment from NVP and Bertelsmann India Investments. In 2022, Pepperfry became a publicly traded company and announced its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of that year.

Before taking on the role of CEO, Ashish Shah served as the COO at Pepperfry, where he oversaw operations and product management.

In 2023, Pepperfry appointed him as the new CEO after the demise of former chief, Ambareesh Murty.
