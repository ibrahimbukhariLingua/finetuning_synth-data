Former and original owner-operator Chevron sold its Canadian assets to Parkland Fuel Corp for C$1.46 billion ($1.09 billion) in April 2017, including 129 gasoline stations, three terminals and the Burnaby oil refinery.
According to the Oil & Gas Journal, the refinery completed a major turnaround in spring 2020.


## History

The refinery was established in 1935 by Standard Oil of California as one of few heavy industries in the area at that time - 2000 bbls/day. Major expansion took place in the mid 1950s to 11,000 bbls/day as part of post war BC building boom. Further capacity increases in the mid 1970s to 35,000 bbls/day including a steady advancement in technology. Other lower mainland refineries were converted to terminals in the early 1990s with production transferred to Alberta.
