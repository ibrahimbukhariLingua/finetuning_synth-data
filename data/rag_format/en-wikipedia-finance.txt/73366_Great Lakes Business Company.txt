* 26 August 2007 - In Kongolo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 14 of 15 aboard died when an overloaded Antonov An-32B (NATO reporting name "Curl", registration *9Q-CAC*) owned by Agefreco Air and operated by the Great Lakes Business Company crashed short of the runway while attempting to return to the airport after experiencing engine problems. The tin trade had become lucrative and violent when the use of lead solder was phased out of electronics for environmental reasons, and the aircraft was overloaded with nine tons of cassiterite (tin ore) and other minerals in addition to its 12 passengers and three-person crew of two Ukrainians and one Russian. The company's licence was suspended on 29 August 2007, along with the airport manager and the Kinshasa director of civil aviation, pending an inquiry.
