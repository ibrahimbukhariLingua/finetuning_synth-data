**Jón Steinsson** (born 1976) is an Icelandic-American economist who is the Chancellor's Professor of Economics at University of California, Berkeley, a research associate and co-director of the Monetary Economics program of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and associate editor of both American Economic Review: Insights, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics. He received his PhD in economics from Harvard and his AB from Princeton.


## Research

Steinsson's research focuses on empirical issues in macroeconomics, including price stickiness, the impact of fiscal shocks, and measurement errors in official statistics. In his most cited work, "Five facts about prices", he and Emi Nakamura showed that many measured price changes are due to temporary sales, scheduled far in advance, rather than happening as dynamic responses to economic conditions. This suggested that even though economic data features frequent price changes, this can be compatible with macroeconomic models featuring substantial price rigidity. In another highly cited work, "Fiscal stimulus in a monetary union", he and Emi Nakamura use variation in US government military spending across states to estimate the open-economy government spending multiplier, finding values substantially higher than one. This confirms the prediction of Keynesian macroeconomic models that fiscal stimulus can have substantial effects on output, particularly at the zero lower bound.


## Personal

Steinsson is married to fellow economist and frequent co-author Emi Nakamura, with whom he has two children.
