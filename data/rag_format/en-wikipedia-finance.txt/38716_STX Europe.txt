STX Europe


# STX Europe



**STX Europe AS**, formerly **Aker Yards ASA**, was until 2012 a subsidiary of the South Korean STX Offshore & Shipbuilding.

With headquarters in Oslo, Norway, STX Europe operated 15 shipyards in Brazil, Finland, France, Norway, Romania and Vietnam. The company had three business areas: Cruise & Ferries, Offshore & Specialized Vessels and Other Operations.

In 2012, with rising outstanding debts, STX retained the Finnish cruise shipbuilding yard and sold the remainder as *STX OSV Holdings*, (Offshore & Specialist Vessels), including all the yards, to Fincantieri, which renamed the group Vard.

In September 2014 STX Finland was sold, 70% to Meyer Werft and 30% to the Finnish government. The operations were continued under name Meyer Turku thereafter. Meyer Werft acquired the Finnish government's 30% in April 2015.

In 2017 STX France was acquired by the French government after the bankruptcy of STX Corporation and reverted to its original name of Chantiers de l'Atlantique.


## History


### Background: before 2006

The evolution of STX Europe originated with the founding of two prominent shipbuilding groups in Europe. One was the Norway-based **Aker Yards**, created in 2004 by combining the shipbuilding activities of Aker and Kværner with the France-based Alstom shipbuilding group, which has shipyards (formerly those of Chantiers de l'Atlantique) in Saint-Nazaire and in Lorient.


### Transition to STX Europe, and expansion: 2006–2012

On 4 January 2006, Aker Yards and Alstom announced their intention to join forces in shipbuilding and create together one of the world leaders in this industry, focused on high-value-added ships, including world-class cruise ships. The merger gave Aker Yards a majority shareholding over Alstom's shipbuilding activities; which included Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard – the builder of the liner RMS Queen Mary 2.

Aker ASA, the majority shareholder of Aker Yards; reduced its ownership share from 50.4% to 40.1% in January 2007. Aker divested its total shareholding in March 2007, and in October 2007, STX Business Group secured a 39.2% stake of Aker yards. Later, STX took a controlling stake, and renamed the group to **STX Europe** on 3 November 2008 to reflect the new ownership structure.

In January 2009, STX business group acquired the remaining shares in STX Europe and became the company's sole shareholder. In February 2009, it was decided to delist STX Europe from Oslo Stock Exchange where it was previously listed under the ticker STXEUR.
