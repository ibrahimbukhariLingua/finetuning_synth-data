Greater Vancouver Board of Trade


# Greater Vancouver Board of Trade



**The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade** (GVBOT) is a non-profit organization. It serves Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in a fashion similar to the Board of Trade or Chamber of Commerce. The Board is the largest business association between Victoria and Toronto, participating in activities such as engaging in advocacy to impact public policy at all levels of government, facilitating networking opportunities, and providing professional development resources for its members.


## Role in Local Governance

The Greater Vancouver Board of Trade has been vested by federal and provincial governments with the power to select board members for a number of local governance bodies and institutions. The Board of Trade selects one of the five members of the Screening Panel that shortlists candidates for TransLink's Board of Directors and is also involved in selecting directors for Port Metro Vancouver and the Vancouver Airport Authority.


## History

In 1983, the Board became a member of the World Trade Centers Association and in 1986 moved into the Vancouver World Trade Centre office complex at Canada Place. It hosted the General Assembly of the World Trade Centers Association the same year.

In 1990 the Board launched its Federal Debt Clock, a 1,500 lb (680 kg), 15 ft (4.6 m) by 10 ft (3.0 m) computerized calculator that tracked the rise in government debt. At the time, Canada's $363 billion debt was climbing at a rate of $53,300 per minute. In 1998, Finance Minister Paul Martin hit the gong and stopped the clock at a special Board of Trade luncheon. The board's debt clock stopped just shy of $600 billion.
