In 1995 he was delegated to BASF Italia Spa, Milan, as Head of Marketing and Sales Pharma Intermediates. From 1997 he was staff to the vice chairman of the board. After working as productions director for fat-soluble vitamins in the Fine Chemicals division from 1999, he was promoted in the following years to Senior Vice President Strategic Planning BASF Group and President Functional Polymers Division.

Brudermüller was nominated by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2022.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, Brudermüller strongly opposed a proposed EU ban on Russian gas imports. He said it would destroy the German economy. BASF has sizeable investments in the Russian natural gas industry and partners with Gazprom. The German central bank said it would reduce German GDP for the year by 5% while other economists said it would reduce German GDP by 0.3 to 3%.
