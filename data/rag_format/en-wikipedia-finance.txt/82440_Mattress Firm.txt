On October 5, 2018, Mattress Firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company planned to break 700 lease contracts by closing 200 unprofitable stores and was considering closing the other 500 stores out of the more than 3,300 it operated at that time. In November 2018, Mattress Firm emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In 2019, Mattress Firm appointed John Eck as CEO.

In March 2020, Mattress Firm was one of several retailers to announce it would not pay some or all of its rent in April due to the effects of COVID-19.

In 2023 the company announced it would move its headquarters to Westchase, Houston as the lease at its current headquarters ends.

In May 2023 Tempur Sealy announced plans to acquire the firm in a reported $4 billion merger deal, however it was blocked by the FTC in July 2024 due to competition concerns over the proposed deal.


## Acquisitions

In June 2000, Sleep Train sold 24 of its stores (mainly in Seattle and Portland), or about 30 percent of its business, to Fenway Partners, a New York private-investment firm which had acquired Sleep Country USA, a competing chain established in 1991, three months earlier. At the time, Sleep Train had 44 stores (of which 18 were in Washington) and Sleep Country USA had 28 stores.
In 2002, Sleep Train Inc. announced plans to purchase 54 Mattress Discounters' stores in California during that company's bankruptcy—which would double Sleep Train's size.

In 2003, Fenway Partners sold Sleep Country USA to the Atlanta-based Simmons Company, and in August 2006, Sleep Train Inc. purchased the then-55-store mattress chain from Simmons.

In September 2011, Sleep Train acquired Christian's Mattress Xpress, converting three stores into new Sleep Train stores in Visalia, Fresno and Fowler, California. The following month, October 2011, Sleep Train purchased Mattress Outlet, a 14-store company with 13 stores in eastern Washington and one in Idaho, and America's Mattress, a seven-store company in western Washington. In October 2012, Sleep Train acquired Sleep City, an 8-store chain in Eastern Washington and Idaho. In April 2014, Sleep Train acquired America's Mattress in Hawaii. The acquisition included nine local America's Mattress stores: five stores on Oahu, two stores on the Big Island in Kona and Hilo, and one each on the islands of Maui and Kauai.

On September 4, 2014, Mattress Firm Inc. announced it would buy The Sleep Train Inc. for $425 million. In February and March 2017, the Sleep Train stores were renamed as Mattress Firm outlets.


### Sleep Country USA

In March 2000, New York-based Fenway Partners Inc. acquired Sleep Country from Robert Cook and Sunny Kobe Cook. In 2003, Fenway Partners sold Sleep Country USA to the Atlanta-based Simmons Company. In August 2006, The Sleep Train, Inc. purchased the then-55-store Sleep Country USA Pacific Northwest chain from Simmons for $55m. The chain continued to operate as Sleep Country USA. Sleep Country Canada, an unaffiliated company, uses the same jingle.ᶠᵘʳᵗʰᵉʳ ᵉˣᵖˡᵃⁿᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In July 2015, the Kent, Washington-based Sleep Country USA company announced that it would begin rebranding all of its stores with the **Sleep Train** name, the California-based company that Mattress Firm now owns.
