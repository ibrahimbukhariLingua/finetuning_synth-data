## Career

In 2004, he coined the term the "Asset Management Barbell", "which predicted that the bulk of assets would be invested in low-cost passive or index-hugging products such as ETFs, with a small but significant amount in high margin" and "high alpha products, with intensifying pressure on the middle ground of more conventional asset management"

In 2012, he coined the term "Balkanisation of Banking Markets", to describe the breakdown in cross-border banking lending, as regulators looked to put up barriers to protect domestic markets and the policy challenge to rebuild a single market in lending within the Eurozone.

The Review was published 20 June 2019 alongside the Bank's response to the Governor's Annual Mansion House Speech. Recommendations included updating regulations for digital payments, considering opening up the Bank's balance sheet to new payment firms, a climate stress test for financial institutions and championing low carbon transition disclosures.
