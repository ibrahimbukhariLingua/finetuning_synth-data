# Indxx



**Indxx, Inc.** is a global diversified financial services firm. Founded in 2005 by Mexx Co-founder PK Sen Sharma, the company has offices in New Delhi, India; New York, USA; Miami, USA and Prague, Czech Republic. It currently has over 100 employees spread across four main business groups: Indxx Indices, Custom Indices, Client Indices and Equity Basket Calculation.

The firm specializes in the development and publishing of proprietary custom indices, which are licensed to financial intermediaries worldwide. Indxx indices are currently used as benchmarks for exchange-traded funds, SMAs, and other financial products.


## Main Business Groups

* **Indxx Indices:** Unique index concepts developed fully in-house, by Indxx, and offered for license for passive products. Recent examples of this include the Indxx Blockchain Index, and Indxx Disruptive Technologies Index.
* **Custom Indices:** Indices built, upon request, for the exclusive use of a client by Indxx’s index development team. Recent examples of this include the Indxx Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index and Indxx Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Index.
* **Client Indices:** In contrast to the Indxx Indices or Custom Indices services, where index development is driven by Indxx, the Client Indices service is for clients who know the exact methodology they want. Indxx’s team then codes, builds and backtests the index based on the client’s instructions. Common coding languages utilized include Python, MATLAB, and others.
* **Equity Basket Calculation:** Best utilized by clients who seek to run their own equity index methodologies and simply provide Indxx with the index names and weights.
