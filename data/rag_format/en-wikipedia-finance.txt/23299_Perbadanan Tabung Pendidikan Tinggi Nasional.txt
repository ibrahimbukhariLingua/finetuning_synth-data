## Criticism of PTPTN


### Free Education Proposal

Some parties, particularly the opposition parties and student organizations want higher education for free and abolish PTPTN agency. Several demonstrations have been made including a meeting with the government. The government will not make education free for some reason

Beginning 2015, hardcore PTPTN loan defaulters have been listed inside Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS), which is a Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) database system that stores financial records of Malaysian borrowers. Defaulters also run the risk of being barred from leaving the country altogether.
