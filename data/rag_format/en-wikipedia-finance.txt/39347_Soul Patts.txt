## History

In 1872, Caleb Soul and his son Washington Handley opened a pharmacy store in Pitt Street, Sydney. In 1886, Lewy Pattinson opened a pharmacy in Balmain. In April 1902, Pattinson bought Soul out with the business incorporated as Washington H Soul Pattinson & Company Limited. On 21 January 1903, the company was listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange.
