## History

The property was designed by Clarence E. Wunder, and was built in 1922.

The building served as the Hotel Pennsylvania. In the 1940s, it became known as the **Hotel Philadelphian**.

It was sold to Sheraton Hotels in December 1946, and was renamed the **Penn-Sheraton Hotel**. Sheraton sold the hotel to Hertfield Hotels in October 1953, and they renamed the Penn-Sheraton very slightly, changing it to the **Penn Sherwood Hotel**. In 1962, the hotel rejoined Sheraton as a franchise, operating as the **Sheraton Motor Inn** until 1966. As of 2005, the property was managed by Aimco. In June 2006, Aimco bought a majority stake of the property. In 2020, it was contributed to Apartment Income REIT Corp., which was acquired by funds managed by The Blackstone Group.
