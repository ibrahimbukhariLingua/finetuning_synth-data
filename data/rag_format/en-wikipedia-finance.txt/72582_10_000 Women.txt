# 10,000 Women



**10,000 Women** is a program organized by Goldman Sachs and the Goldman Sachs Foundation with the goal of helping to grow local economies by providing business education, mentoring and networking, and access to capital to underserved women entrepreneurs globally. The program was announced on March 5, 2008, at Columbia University. The initiative is one of the largest philanthropic projects the bank has been involved with. The program was in its initial years run by Dina Habib Powell, a managing director at Goldman Sachs.

The program was continuing in 2022; Goldman Sachs published a report on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on female entrepreneursfrom the viewpoint of the 10,000 Women program.
