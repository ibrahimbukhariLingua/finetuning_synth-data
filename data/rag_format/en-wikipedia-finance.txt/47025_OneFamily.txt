# OneFamily



**OneFamily** is a financial services provider with offices in Brighton and Hove, Sussex, Peterborough, Leeds and Swindon. It is a mutual society and as such has no shareholders, and is instead owned by its members.


## History

In 2022, OneFamily announced its acquisition of life insurer brand Beagle Street.

In 2014, after gaining the backing of 95% of its members, Engage Mutual Assurance merged with Brighton-based Family Investments to create OneFamily, which began trading under its new name from April 1, 2015. The business was moved to Brighton.

OneFamily has 2.6 million customers across the UK and is responsible for £8 billion of assets under management.


## Products and services

OneFamily provides a range of financial services including over-50s life insurance, insurance bonds, tax-efficient savings plans, lifetime ISAs, lifetime mortgages and independent lifetime mortgage advice. It also supports existing Child Trust Fund accounts that were created prior to their discontinuation by the British government in 2011, and replaced with Junior ISAs.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
