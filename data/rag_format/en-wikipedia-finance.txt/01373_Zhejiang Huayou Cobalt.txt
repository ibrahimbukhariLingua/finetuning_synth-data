Continued expansion efforts in 2023 include the construction of the Guangxi Plant, extension of the Quzhou Plant, and the establishment of a European Plant.


## Business segments

After decades of development, Huayou Cobalt has established an integrated industrial chain around Li-ion battery material. The African resource industry group, Indonesian nickel industry group, new material industry group, new energy industry group and recycling industry group constitutes the five major industries of Huayou.


### Resources

The company's resource operations primarily involve the extraction, refining, and initial processing of various non-ferrous metals, including cobalt, nickel, lithium, and copper. In the cobalt and copper sectors, the main products are crude cobalt hydroxide and electrolytic copper. The company has established a business model for its African resource activities, centered around a combination of self-owned mines and supplementary sourcing from local mines and mining companies in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Regarding the nickel business, the primary offerings consist of crude nickel hydroxide and high-grade nickel intermediates. The company ensures its supply of nickel ore mainly through holding shares of mine and long-term cooperative agreements for supply, with additional sourcing based on market dynamics.

In the lithium sector, the company engages in mining and ore selection from its proprietary mines in Zimbabwe, which contribute to the production of main products – lithium spodumene concentrate and lithian mica concentrate.


### New Materials

The New Material Industry sector plays a connecting role in Huayou's business industrial chain. Its main products include ternary precursor, cobalt tetroxide, nickel sulphate and cobalt hydroxide which are mainly used in aerospace superalloy, battery cathode materials for 3C products and power batteries and industrial catalysts.


### New Energy

Huayou New Energy Industrial Group is the core business unit of cathode materials. Huayou New Energy currently has four major bases in Chengdu, Tianjin, Quzhou, and Guangxi, two domestic joint ventures: Leyou New Energy Materials (Wuxi) Co., Ltd., Zhejiang POSCO-HUAYOU ESM Co., Ltd. and an oversea joint venture LG BCM.Ltd.(Korea), furthermore, the plans to invest in the construction of a cathode material project for high-nickel power batteries in Hungary through its holding subsidiary Bamo Technology Hungary Kft Co., Ltd was officially announced on June 21, 2023.


### Recycling

The recycling industry sector established a business model of Closed loop “swap waste to materials”, and providing customers with safe and sustainable waste battery solutions. The Modular pre-processing capability allows the company to processing 65,000 tons of waste power batteries annually.


## Sustainability

## Child labor allegations and Huayou's actions to take responsibilities

According to a joint Amnesty International and African Resources Watch report, Congo DongFang International Mining, a subsidiary of Huayou Cobalt, sources cobalt from primitive "artisanal" mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there are few worker protections and child labor has been employed. Apple Inc. said that approximately 20% of the cobalt in Apple's batteries were sourced from Huayou Cobalt.

In response, Huayou Cobalt admits to having "insufficient awareness of supply chain management", and did not know that buying artisanal cobalt would increase child labor.

In 2016, Apple said that starting in 2017, they will treat cobalt as a conflict mineral, and require all cobalt suppliers to agree to outside supply-chain audits and risk assessments. After a 2017 Sky News follow-up that showed that child labor continued to be utilized, Apple said it stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in DRC entirely.

In June 2018, Signify, together with Fairphone and Huayou Cobalt, co-founded the Fair Cobalt Alliance.

In Jan 2019, Ford initiated the project with IBM, LG Chem and Huayou Cobalt to ensure the mineral used in lithium-ion batteries had not been mined by children or used to fuel conflict. The typical electric car battery requires up to 20 pounds of cobalt, and by 2026, demand for cobalt is expected to multiply eightfold.

In March 2023, Ford Motor Co., PT Vale Indonesia Tbk, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. have agreed to invest in the Pomalaa Block High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) Project, creating a three-party collaboration to advance more sustainable nickel production in Indonesia and help make electric vehicle batteries more affordable. The project is expected to produce up to 120 kilotons per year of contained nickel in the form of mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), a lower-cost nickel product used in EV batteries with nickel-rich cathodes. The project will have an equity investment of an undisclosed amount from all three companies. The collaboration will help support Ford's plan to deliver a 2 million EV production run rate by the end of 2026 and further scale over time.
