# Vinod Goenka



**Vinod Goenka** (born 2 July 1959) is an Indian real-estate developer and billionaire. He is Chairman and Managing Director of Valor Estate (formerly DB Realty Limited), a real estate development company headquartered in Mumbai, India.

In 2010, his net worth was estimated at US$1.18 billion.


## Early life and education

Goenka was born in 1959 to a Marwari business family in Kolkata. When he was 6 years old, his family moved to Mumbai. He first attended Green Lawns High School, then Jamnabai Narsee School, and eventually finished his schooling at Campion School, Mumbai.


## Career

At just 19 years old, he began working in his father's business in the 1980s. In the early 1980s, Goenka started his real estate empire with Conwood Constructions and launched projects at Gokuldham and Yashodham in Goregaon, Mahavir Nagar in Kandivli and Vasant Vihar in Thane. In 1994, he diversified his business by venturing into the dairy industry in partnership with the US-based Schreiber Foods, establishing an integrated dairy plant in Baramati. By 2006, he partnered with Shahid Balwa, another Mumbai-based realtor in a 50:50 collaboration to develop Le MÃ©ridien Mumbai (now Hilton International Airport Hotel). This partnership resulted in the creation of the DB group.

Goenka, known for cluster development in Mumbai and its suburbs, focuses on redeveloping aging buildings and converting them into affordable housing while adhering to sustainable urban growth and town planning goals. In 2020, the Government of Maharashtra established a steering committee comprising cabinet ministers, senior officials, and industry leaders, including developers like Goenka to address real estate challenges and support initiatives like these.

As of January 2025, Goenka is involved in redevelopment projects in and around Mumbai, including slums, cooperative societies, and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority-owned properties. Since beginning his work in slum redevelopment in 1995, he has been part of projects totaling over 1 million square feet. He is currently involved in Ten BKC, a five-acre redevelopment project near Bandra Kurla Complex, developed in collaboration with Adani GoodHomes.


## Personal life

Goenka resides in Mumbai. He is married to Aseela Goenka and has two children, a son and a daughter.


## Controversies

Goenka was arrested on 20 April 2011 for his alleged involvement in the 2G spectrum case. During his imprisonment, he temporarily stepped down from his roles in the companies he was associated with. After spending over seven months in custody, Goenka was granted bail by the Supreme Court of India on 23 November 2011.

In 2013, UAE telecommunications operator Etisalat sued its Indian joint venture partners Vinod Goenka and Shahid Balwa for fraud after the Indian Supreme Court cancelled Goenka's 2G licenses as a part of the 2G spectrum case.

On 21 December 2017, Goenka and all 18 other accused persons in the 2G spectrum case were acquitted of all charges levied against them.
