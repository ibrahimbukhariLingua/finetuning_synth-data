# Chile and the World Bank



Chile joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the founding branch of the World Bank Group, on December 31, 1945.


## History of Membership

Chile was part of the original 44 member countries at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference who signed its Articles of Agreement which pegged the world currencies to the dollar and established the IMF and the IBRD for short-term and long-term capital projects, respectively. Chile joined other branches of the World Bank Group relatively soon after their creation, they joined the International Development Association (IDA) on December 30, 1960, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on April 15, 1957, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) the day it was established (April 12, 1988). The exception is the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) which Chile joined on October 24, 1991, 25 years after its establishment.

Between 2000 and 2017, the population living in poverty (on US$ 4 per day) decreased from 31% to 6.4%."
