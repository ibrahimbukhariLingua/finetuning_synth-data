In 2014, Pascal partnered with Crown Resorts, owned by billionaire James Packer, to develop Alon Las Vegas. On August 5, 2014, they acquired 35 acres on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip for $280 million, where the New Frontier Hotel and Casino once stood, to develop the new $2.4 billion resort, with additional investments from Oaktree Capital Management, with the hopes of opening in late 2018. Crown announced in December 2016 that it was withdrawing from the project and seeking to sell its interest. Alon Leisure Management, LLC., led by Pascal, announced it was seeking other partners to proceed with the project.
