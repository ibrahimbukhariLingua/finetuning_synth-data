## History


### Phenix Bank and Chatham Bank

Phenix Bank was established in 1812 as the banking division of the New York Manufacturing Company, which made cotton looms and supplies. As the banking division initially focused on selling wire, it was named Wire Bank, becoming an independent institution in 1817 under the name Phenix Bank, with headquarters at 24 Wall Street. In 1894, the Lombard & Ayres company of New York was worth $1,000,000, and the majority of its assets were kept in the Phenix National Bank in London, where Josiah Lombard was the director.

The Chatham Bank was established in 1850. On August 14, 1910, it was reported that George M. Hard had resigned as president of Chatham National Bank after fifty years with the bank, and had been elected chairman by the board.
Shortly after becoming a member of the Chatham board, after Hard, Louis Graveraet Kaufman became the president of Chatham National Bank of New York, although only after receiving special dispensation allowing him to remain president of First National Bank of Marquette. When Kaufman became president of Chatham, the bank's deposits were about $7,000,000.

Chatham and Phenix Officers at the time included George M. Hard as chairman, Louis G. Kaufman as president, and three vice presidents. The merger was completed on January 14, 1915. The value of the merged institutions was $32,000,000. At the time, Kaufman was president of the Chatham, with Kaufman putting the deal through.
