In March 2022 Lisin called for a peaceful resolution in a letter to staff at NLMK, writing that *"Lost lives are always a huge tragedy that is impossible to justify. I am convinced that peaceful diplomatic conflict resolution is always preferable to the use of force."* However, in September 2022 it was claimed that NLMK had supplied materials to Russian firms involved in nuclear weapon development, and that tankers owned by Lisin had participated in evading EU sanctions by trans-shipping oil at sea to EU-registered vessels. In October 2022 the US was urged to sanction Lisin. Lisin and NLMK responded, as was cited by The Times, RFE/RL and other outlets, with the following: *"The Russian operations of NLMK are not capable of producing steel intended for military applications. Our operations focus solely on producing rolled strip steel intended for general civilian use. NLMK has never supplied military intended products to the Russian military-industrial complex. That said, NLMK cannot control end uses of its civilian products"*. As for vessels, the company sold them off as unprofitable in September 2022, according to Kommersant.
