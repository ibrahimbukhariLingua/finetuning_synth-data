**Stefan Bollinger** (born 1974) is a Swiss banker, who is the current chief executive officer (CEO) of Julius Baer Group.


## Career

Stefan Bollinger started his career at Zürcher Kantonalbank, later on moving to JP Morgan in London. Afterwards, he joined Goldman Sachs in 2004 where he stayed as a partner for 14 years with the role of co-head of private wealth management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. During his tenure there, he doubled assets under management over the past five years.

In July of last year, he was appointed to the role of chief executive officer of Julius Baer, his current role. This was after the then CEO, Philipp Rickenbache, was ousted after the bank lost 586 million Swiss Francs on loan to the collapsed property firm Signa, with Nic Dreckmann acting as the temporary CEO for the time being.

On the 9th of January this year, Stefan Bollinger started working at Julius Baer. Julius Baer is facing many issues as of now, and he is expected to attempt to resolve these issues. Baer’s cost-to-income ratio has deteriorated steadily since 2021, as expenses grew faster than revenue. The afforementioned losses, along with finma's investigation into the company are all issues that Bollinger is expected to tackle. Hence, he is expected to introduce new reforms. At a town-hall meeting in Zurich, he urged employees to think for themselves, saying he’d “never seen” a bank with more consultants, and received much applause for the statement.
