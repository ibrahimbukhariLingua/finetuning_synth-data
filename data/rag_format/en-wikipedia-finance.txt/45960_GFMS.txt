**GFMS** (formally Gold Fields Mineral Services) are research and consultancy company for the precious metal markets. Since 2011 they have been part of Thomson Reuters. As well as other commodities, they research gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper trading.


## History

The consultancy’s core publication is the annual *Gold Survey*, which began in 1967. Consolidated Gold Fields, a mining conglomerate that was later taken over by Hanson plc in 1989, originally launched the *Gold Survey*. After the take over, a company was formed the same year to continue the survey.

Between 1994 and 1998, the company was owned by Gold Fields of South Africa. Between 1998 and 2003, the company was known as Gold Fields Mineral Services Limited. In 1998, members of the research team completed a management buy out of GFMS from GFSA, and the consultancy gained full independence. In 2002, GFMS became an associate member of the London Bullion Market Association.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
