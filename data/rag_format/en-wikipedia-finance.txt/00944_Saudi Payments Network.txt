Saudi Payments Network


# Saudi Payments Network



The Saudi Payments Network (Arabic: الشبكة السعودية للمدفوعات), commonly known as Mada (Arabic: مدى, literally "range" or "extend" ; formerly SPAN), is the primary payment system in Saudi Arabia. Established by the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA), the network connects all automated teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale (POS) terminals across the Kingdom to a central payment switch that routes transactions to the appropriate card issuer.


## Overview

All banks operating in Saudi Arabia are mandated by SAMA to issue ATM cards that are fully compatible with the network. Customers benefit from free service regardless of the ATM used, its operator, or the card issuer. Mada operates through a vast infrastructure comprising more than 17,000 ATMs and over 225,000 POS terminals within the country. In partnership with global payment systems such as Visa, MasterCard, and Maestro, the network also enables access to millions of ATMs and POS terminals worldwide.


## Network Statistics

As of the latest available data, Mada has achieved significant milestones:

* **1.7 million POS devices** in operation across Saudi Arabia.
* **8.9 billion transactions** processed through the network.
* **613.9 billion SAR** in transaction value.
* **8.6 billion NFC transactions**, demonstrating a strong shift towards contactless payments.
* **575.6 billion SAR** in NFC transaction value.
* **47.7 million Mada cards** issued to customers.

## History and Upgrades

Mada was originally launched as SPAN and later upgraded to SPAN2. This newer version complies with EMV standards and incorporates a higher-capacity infrastructure that reduces transaction processing times—particularly at POS terminals—thereby addressing limitations of the first-generation system.


## Services and Features

Mada supports electronic payments through multiple channels:

* **Point-of-Sale (POS) Terminals:** Facilitates face-to-face transactions.
* **Soft POS:** Allows payment acceptance via mobile devices.
* **Automated Teller Machines (ATMs):** Enables cash withdrawals and other banking functions.
* **E-commerce Platforms:** Supports online transactions.

The Mada network exclusively issues only debit and prepaid cards, which are always co-branded [Mandatory] with GCC NET and either Visa or MasterCard to ensure international acceptance.

Mada offers two primary payment services:

* **Atheer:** An NFC (near-field communication) payment service that enables contactless transactions using Mada cards.
* **Naqd:** A service that permits cardholders to withdraw cash directly from merchants, eliminating the need to visit an ATM or bank branch.

Additionally, Mada has introduced an NFC mobile payment application—Mada Pay—available only on Android devices. This application supports the addition of Mada, MasterCard, and Visa cards issued by banks or digital wallets in Saudi Arabia.


## Partnerships and Acceptance

Mada has established partnerships with a range of global payment networks to facilitate its use on POS devices, ATMs, and online gateways. The following networks are accepted, subject to merchant discretion (with mandatory acceptance of Mada network):
