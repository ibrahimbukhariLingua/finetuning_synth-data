**Topgrading** is a corporate hiring and interviewing methodology that is intended to identify preferred candidates for a particular position. In the methodology, prospective employees undergo a 12-step process that includes extensive interviews, the creation of detailed job scorecards, research into job history, coaching, and more. After being interviewed and reference-checked, job candidates are grouped into one of three categories: A Players, B Players, or C Players. A Players have the most potential for high performance in their role while B and C Players may require more work to be successful. The methodology has been used by major corporations and organizations like General Electric, Lincoln Financial, Honeywell, Barclays, and the American Heart Association.


## Origin

The term was coined by Bradford D. Smart and his son, Geoffrey, in a 1997 article in *Directors and Boards* magazine. The elder Smart had used practices similar to topgrading when he helped set up General Electric's hiring practices in the 1980s and 1990s. His consulting firm practiced and taught topgrading methods. In 1999, Smart also released a book called *Topgrading: How Leading Companies Win by Hiring, Coaching and Keeping the Best People* that detailed the topgrading process. The most recent edition of the book was released in 2012 and became a New York Times and *Wall Street Journal* bestseller.
