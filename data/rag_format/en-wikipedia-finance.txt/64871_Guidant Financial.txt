## History

David Nilssen and Jeremy Ames co-founded Guidant Financial in 2003. According to Nilssen, their goal was to help individuals self-direct their IRA or 401(k) "to a variety of investment opportunities, including the purchase of a business or franchise." The company has been recognized by many organizations for its growth, impact, culture and leadership.

In 2019, Guidant Financial opened two new offices in Boise, Idaho, and Ho Chi Mihn City, Vietnam. Beginning in 2021, the company went entirely remote.
