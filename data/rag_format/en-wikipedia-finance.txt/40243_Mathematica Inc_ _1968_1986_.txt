Mathematica Inc. (1968–1986)


# Mathematica Inc. (1968–1986)



**Mathematica Inc.** was a multi-faceted American software company and consulting group founded by Princeton University professors in 1968. The company had three primary divisions: **Mathematica Policy Research**, which did consulting work, mostly "to develop mathematical models for marketing decision making"; **Mathematica Products Group**, best known for developing the RAMIS programming language; and **MathTech**, the company's technical and economic consulting group. The company was also a leading developer of state lottery systems.

In early 1982, the company's stock was split 3-for-2. Mathematica Products Group was soon spun off and purchased by Martin Marietta Corporation, in May 1983. The division was then renamed **Mathematica & Oxford Software**. Marietta sold Mathematica & Oxford Software to On-Line Software International in 1986; On-Line was in turn sold to Computer Associates, in 1991. Mathematica Policy Research and MathTech were also spun off, and in 1986 both independently became employee-owned companies. Mathematica Policy Research was eventually renamed to Mathematica Inc. and it is the only former unit still carrying the full *Mathematica* name.


## Early day participants

* Oskar Morgenstern, economist and one of the company's founders (1968)
* Tibor Fabian, Mathematica's Hungarian-born president (1980s)
* William Baumol and William Bowen, economists and early day participants

## Divisions

* Mathematica Policy Research⁣ – the only former unit still carrying the *Mathematica* name.
* Mathematica Products Group – best known for developing RAMIS
* MathTech, the company's technical and economic consulting group – "research projects and computer systems other than Ramis."

A quarter of a century after Mathematica's founding, it "was largely owned by a group of professors in Mathematics and Economics at Princeton University ... as this group aged, they opted to cash out by selling." The result was a 3-way split: two units became employee-owned companies and another was sold several times.


### Mathematica Products Group

In 1982, **Mathematica Products Group'**s RAMIS was described as "nonprocedural" and "bordering on artificial intelligence." This unit of Mathematica was purchased by Martin Marietta Corporation in 1983 and renamed to Mathematica & Oxford Software. Marietta sold Mathematica & Oxford Software in 1986 to On-Line Software International, who merged the subsidiary into their own main operations; On-Line was in turn sold to Computer Associates, in 1991.

The RAMIS product sold well, initially on mainframes, subsequently on PCs.


### Mathematica Policy Research

The **Mathematica Policy Research** (MPR) unit's strength was in "social experiments and surveys." In 1983 MPR reported "a major survey assignment for the American Medical Association."

In 1986, it became a separate, employee-owned company.


### MathTech

Like MPR, in 1986 **MathTech** became an employee-owned company. Known today as Mathtech, Inc., it was described by The New York Times as "a Washington-area educational consulting firm
