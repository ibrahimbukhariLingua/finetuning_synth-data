## History


### Early history

Several foreign companies and entrepreneurs came to the Caucasus in the late 19th century. They saw the opportunities and resource extraction. Investment of foreign, especially, western companies in Azerbaijan began from the late 19th century.

The Siemens brothers came across the copper mine in Gadabay at almost the same time as the Nobel brothers got involved in the oil industry in Baku. Siemens & Halske AG had won a contract to build and maintain the telegraph lines in Russia, including the Caucasus, in the 1850s and 1860s. During this period, Walter von Siemens spotted the lucrative business opportunity in Gadabay and convinced his older brothers, Carl and Werner, to invest in it.

The purchase of the mine by the Siemens brothers was disliked by their partner, Johann Halske, which contributed to his break from Siemens & Halske AG. The reason was that the company's major industrial focus was not mining, but telegraphic services, communications and electric power generation. The brothers did not merge the mining industry into their main company. They ran this industry as a private business of the Siemens brothers – Werner, Carl and Walter. Gebruder Siemens (Siemens Brothers) purchased the copper mines in Gadabay in 1864. The copper mine of Gadabay is one of the oldest mines during the prehistoric times. They renovated mines and factories, built a railroad system, villages, and bridges. In 1865 they built a copper smelter and in 1873 connected it to the mine by a 6-km narrow gauge railway.Azerbaijan Railways CJSC and the German Siemens company still try to enhance cooperation.

The Bibi-Heybat power plant was founded with participation of Siemens in 1901. Siemens completed the 11,000 km Indo-European telegraph line from London to Calcutta in 1867, part of which went through Azerbaijani territory. Siemens established a representative office in Baku, Azerbaijan in 1998. Siemens supports the development and improvement of the country's power generation, transmission and distribution network.

German business had a role in Azerbaijani industry during the history. Gebruder Vohrer (Vohrer Brothers) began to affix their own label on bottles in 1847. Gebruder Hummel (Hummel Brothers) established their wine-producing business in 1878 and constructed the first brandy factory in 1895.
