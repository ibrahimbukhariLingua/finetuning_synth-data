## History

Yamagata Bank can trace its origins to 1878, when *The 81st National Bank* was founded. In 1897, this bank was later absorbed by the *Ryouu Bank*, which was established one year earlier. The bank merged with numerous small financial institutions over the first half of the 20th century, and finally changed its name to its present form in 1965.

In October 2005, Yamagata Bank, along with the Saitama Resona Bank, *82 Bank* and Hokkoku Bank jointly injected funds into *Allegro MicroSystems*, an American subsidiary of *Sanken Electric Co. Ltd.*, after Sanken purchased Minnesota-based semiconductor producer *PolarFab*.
