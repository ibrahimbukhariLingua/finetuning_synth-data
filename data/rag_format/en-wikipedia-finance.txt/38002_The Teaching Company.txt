# The Teaching Company



**The Teaching Company**, doing business as "The Great Courses," formerly **Wondrium**, is a media production company which produces educational, video, and audio content in the form of courses, documentaries, and series under two content brands: The Great Courses Plus and The Great Courses. The company distributes their content globally through a mix of direct-to-consumer models, such as their streaming service Wondrium.com and TheGreatCourses.com, as well as distribution through third party platforms like the Apple TV app, Audible, Amazon Prime, and Roku.

The Teaching Company, founded by Tom Rollins in 1990, changed its name to The Great Courses and then to Wondrium, It is currently owned by Brentwood Associates PE and is headquartered in Chantilly which is west of Fairfax, Virginia.


## History

In 1990, the company was founded by Thomas M. Rollins, former chief counsel of the United States Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. He had been inspired by a 10-hour video-taped lecture series by Irving Younger which he watched to prepare for an exam while at Harvard Law School. He never forgot the series and wanted to share the experience with others. He recruited professors and experts to record lectures, with the first courses covering psychology, political theory, and Shakespeare.

By 2000, the company was well-established, with about $20 million (USD) in annual revenue. In October 2006, the company was acquired by Brentwood Associates, a private equity investment firm. After the acquisition over 6,000 hours of content were digitized, and the number of courses circulated rose from 20 million to 70 million. Sales increased more than 35% the first year and continued to grow at a double-digit pace. The company added indirect distribution channels like Netflix and Audible to their business model in 2013.

The company introduced its online subscription service in 2015 called The Great Courses Plus, which gave consumers streaming access to the majority of The Great Courses content library through a web browser or iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV, or Fire TV app. A year later, it introduced The Great Courses Signature Collection, a subset of Great Courses content offered as a subscription video service through third party platforms like Comcast, Apple TV, and Roku Channels.

In 2016, the firm earned $150 million in annual revenue. In April 2021, the company announced the rebranding of its global streaming platform from the Great Courses Plus to Wondrium. Along with the rebranding, the company announced 1,000 hours of new content sourced from licensing agreements with Kino Lorber, MagellanTV, and Craftsy. The general reaction to changing the name from The Great Courses to Wondrium was one of contempt. Wondrium has now been returned to The Great Courses Plus.

As of 2021, it included over 7,500 hours of content in the format of documentaries, independent films, docuseries, short-form series, featurettes, courses, and tutorials. There are over 1,200 titles with more than 26,000 lectures.


## Content

Wondrium produces video and audio content under its two brands: Wondrium and The Great Courses. Both brands focus on educational content with the promise of learning outcomes. The Wondrium line of content, while also educationally focused, focuses on learning experiences outside of the influence of traditional university curriculum and takes other forms of content outside of courses such as documentaries, docuseries, and travelogues. The Great Courses line of content typically features University level experts and professors presenting in-depth learning across multiple lectures. Courses are developed by the experts and the Wondrium production team. Many of the programs' episodes are around thirty minutes.

The production quality of the courses is "a cut above" free courses offered on YouTube, according to a report in *The New York Times*. President and CEO of Wondrium, Paul Suijk, said that the company is the "Netflix of learning."

Content covers different subjects and categories such as science, math, economics, literature, language, history, religion, philosophy, fine arts, music, better living, health, wellness, how-to courses, personal enrichment, hobbies and leisure, and travel. The company has partnerships with The Culinary Institute of America, the Smithsonian Institution, the Mayo Clinic, National Geographic, Penguin Random House, *Scientific American*, and others. Self-described fans include Bill Gates and George Lucas, who delivered taped opening remarks to a Great Courses conference in 2015.


### Professors and experts

Most programs are delivered by experts in their respective field. The lectures often involve computer graphics and animations; some offer an optional PDF guidebook to serve as a custom-made textbook for the course.


### Audio-only titles available through Audible

While many Wondrium titles are available through Audible under The Great Courses brand, the company also produces a line of audio-only titles exclusively for the Audible Originals brand. As of 2022, the company has produced over 75 of those titles including:

* *The Life and Times of Beethoven*
