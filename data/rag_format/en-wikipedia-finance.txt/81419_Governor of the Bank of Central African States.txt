Governor of the Bank of Central African States


# Governor of the Bank of Central African States



The Governor of the Bank of Central African States is the CEO of the central bank for the six CEMAC member states. Prior to 1978, the Bank was run by a General Manager appointed by the government of France (which guarantees the CFA franc). Beginning in 1978, the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the CEMAC selects the Governor. Initially, the Governor was to always be a national of Gabon. Following the dismissal for cause of Philibert Andzembe in 2009, the Conference decided to rotate the Governorship among member countries, in alphabetical order. Terms of office are seven years, and are nonrenewable.
