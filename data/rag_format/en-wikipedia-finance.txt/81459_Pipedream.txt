### Pipedream (*company*)

**Pipedream** is an innovative hyperlogistics company specializing in the development and implementation of underground autonomous delivery networks. Founded in 2021, Pipedream aims to revolutionize the logistics industry by creating efficient, sustainable, and high-speed delivery solutions that alleviate urban congestion and reduce carbon emissions.


#### History

Pipedream was founded by Garrett McCurrach in 2020 with the vision of transforming urban logistics through advanced technology. The company's headquarters are located in Austin, Texas. Since its inception, Pipedream has focused on developing cutting-edge delivery systems that operate below ground, using electric-powered delivery pods.


#### Technology

Pipedream's core technology involves an underground autonomous logistics network. This system utilizes fully electric delivery pods that travel through a network of underground tunnels, reaching speeds of up to 40 mph. The delivery pods are battery-operated and move through a network of rails, housed by a utility pipe exterior. The network is designed to reduce traffic congestion, noise, and emissions in urban areas.


#### Achievements

In 2024, Pipedream achieved several milestones that underscored its potential to reshape urban logistics:

* **Testing**: Successfully demonstrated delivery pods reaching speeds of up to 40 mph.
* **Funding**: Raised $13 million in seed funding led by Starship Ventures, with participation from Cortado Ventures, Myelin Ventures, and others.
* **Market Interests**: Secured 100 preorders from an undisclosed major customer, reflecting strong market interest.

#### Sustainability

Pipedream is committed to sustainability, aiming to reduce the environmental impact of logistics operations. The company’s use of underground robots alleviates above-ground congestion, simplifying delivery routes for couriers by reducing the overall distance between deliveries. This means drivers use less gas and have less impact on overall traffic.


#### Impact and Future Plans

Pipedream’s technology is expected to have a significant impact on urban living and business operations. In the immediate future, it promises faster and more reliable deliveries, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced urban congestion. Over the next five years, the company aims to scale its technology across multiple cities globally, creating new business opportunities and fostering economic growth in the logistics sector.

By providing a more efficient and environmentally friendly logistics solution, Pipedream is poised to transform the industry, contributing to a more sustainable and efficient future for urban areas worldwide.
