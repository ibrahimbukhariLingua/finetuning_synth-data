# Thomas Borcherding



**Thomas Earl Borcherding** (Feb. 18, 1939 – Feb. 12, 2014) was an American economist. His areas of specialization include microeconomics, public choice, property rights, exchange and transaction costs, politics and public choice, sociological economics, and the role of institutions in economic, political, and social choice.


## Early life and education

Borcherding received a B.A. with high honors from the University of Cincinnati in 1961, and a Ph.D. in economics from Duke University in 1966.

His dissertation was entitled *The Growth of Non-Federal Employment in the United States, 1900 to 1963*.


## Career

Borcherding was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Thomas Jefferson Center for Study of Political Economy at the University of Virginia from 1965 to 1966. He was then, in turn, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Washington (1966–71), an associate professor of economics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (1971–73), and an associate professor of economics and commerce at Simon Fraser University (1973–77). In 1974-75, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.

He was then a visiting professor of law and economics in the Faculty of Law at the University of Toronto (1978–79), a visiting research scholar at the Hoover Institution (1979–80), and a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University (1977–84).

In 1983 he became a professor of economics at Claremont Graduate University, and in 1992 was given the courtesy title of professor of politics at the same institution.


## Views

Borcherding argued that activities tend to be far less efficient when performed by public entities than by private enterprises. In his 1977 article “The Sources of Growth in Public Expenditures in the U.S., 1902-1970,” he formulated the “Bureaucratic Rule of Two,” which states that “Removal of an activity from the private sector to the public sector will double its unit costs of production.” A study by James T. Bennett and Manuel H. Johnson concluded that the “Rule of Two” was “supported by empirical evidence.”

Borcherding's “Bureaucratic Rule of Two” has been cited in many books, articles, op-eds and economics texts
by fellow economists and other writers, some of whom have misattributed the coinage.

A 1988 article in the *Australian Financial Review* that discussed the relative efficiency of publicly and privately owned enterprises said that the “best summary of economic studies of the subject is in a Swiss publication by Thomas Borcherding and others, "Comparing the Efficiency of Private and Public Production: the evidence from five countries", published in Zurich in 1982.” The article noted that the results of Borcherding's book “were adapted in a study Markets or Governments" by senior economic adviser at the RAND Corporation, Charles Wolf.

Several 1981 articles and editorials in the *Toronto Globe and Mail* about the Canadian egg marketing system cited a critical study of that system by Borcherding.

Borcherding was one of 287 academics who signed a letter to the *Washington Times* rejecting a gun-control bill then under consideration by the House of Representatives.

His article “The Demand for the Services of Non-Federal Governments,” written with R. T. Deacon and published in the *American Economic Review* in December 1972, was listed among the “minor classics” by P.B. Downing and E.A. Stafford in “Citations as an Indicator of Classic Works and Major Contributors in Social Choice,” Public Choice (No. 2, 1981), 219-30.

## Research

Borcherding had been researching a number of topics in collaboration with various colleagues, including the question of why there is no U.S. value-added tax; why supermajorities (may) encourage larger public budgets; social security and pension economics in developing societies; and the evolution of public broadcasting.
