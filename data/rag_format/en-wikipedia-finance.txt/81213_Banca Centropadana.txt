Banca Centropadana


# Banca Centropadana



**Banca Centropadana Credito Cooperativo, Società Cooperativa** is an Italian cooperative bank based in Guardamiglio, Lombardy. The bank was a member of Federazione Italiana delle Banche di Credito Cooperativo - Casse Rurali ed Artigiane (*Federcasse*) and Federazione Lombarda delle Banche di Credito Cooperativo (Lombard Co-operative Banks Federation, holding 2.09%).


## History

The bank was founded in 1971 in Guardamiglio as a merger of three rural credit unions.

In 2014 Banca Centropadana acquired some branches of Banca Farnese from Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara.

In 2016, due to banking reform of BCC banks (Law N°49/2016), the bank joined a banking group. The reform allowed banks with more than €200 million shareholders' equity to join a banking group or demutualize, forming a società per azioni. Banca Centropadana chose to remain as a co-operative bank.
