Mr. Bond worked under Don Tyson's son, John H. Tyson, until 2006, when Mr. Bond was rewarded with the CEO job. While CEO of Tyson Foods in 2008, he earned a total compensation of $4,777,807, which included a base salary of $1,251,204; options granted of $2,610,000; and other compensation of $916,603. He left Tyson Foods on January 5, 2009, reportedly amidst tensions with Don Tyson. He had reported in November 2008 that Tyson's finances were worsening. Industry observers said that Bond, who has a reputation as a cost cutter, debated with Mr. Tyson, who is said to more aggressively seek market share, over whether to cut chicken production to improve prices.
