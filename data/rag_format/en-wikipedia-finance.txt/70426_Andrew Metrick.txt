## Yale Program on Financial Stability

After his work with the CEA, Metrick established the Yale Program on Financial Stability, a research group with a mission "to create, disseminate, and preserve knowledge about financial crises." Metrick has been the Director of the Yale Program on Financial Stability since its founding and has overseen its creation of the Systemic Risk Symposium, its annual Financial Crises Academic Conference, and its annual Financial Crisis Forum for senior central bankers. In 2017, Metrick led the Yale Program on Financial Stability in raising $10 million from Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, and Peter G. Peterson. The donation supported the Yale Program on Financial Stability's effort to catalog past financial crises and the policy actions associated with them.

Geithner. He also created an online Coursera class joint with former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner titled "The Global Financial Crisis." The Coursera class had 30,000 active learners as of June 2017, and 3,000 course completers.
