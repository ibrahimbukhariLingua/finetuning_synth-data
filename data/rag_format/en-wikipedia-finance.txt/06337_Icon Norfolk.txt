# Icon Norfolk



**Icon Norfolk** (formerly **Bank of America Center**) in Downtown Norfolk, Virginia, United States, was the tallest building in Virginia from 1967 to 1971, when it was surpassed in height by Richmond City Hall. Constructed as a bank building, it was converted in the late 2010s to apartments and given its current name.


## History

The tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, one of the country's leading architectural firms, and constructed from 1965 to 1967. The building was the tallest in the state of Virginia from 1967 to 1971, when it was surpassed in height by Richmond City Hall. Today,ᵃˢ ᵒᶠ? it is the second-tallest building in City of Norfolk.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Conceived as the headquarters for Virginia National Bank (VNB), the building retained headquarters status for Sovran Bank, formed from the merger of VNB and First & Merchants Bank of Richmond in 1983. After a series of mergers beginning in 1990 (including NationsBank), the building became the regional office for Bank of America in 1998, and was named after the bank.

In 2010, the building was losing tenants to newer office towers in Downtown Norfolk, including the Wells Fargo Center, while the Maersk Line Limited shipping company retained its headquarters there.

In late 2015, developers announced plans to convert the building to a 300-unit luxury apartment tower with ground-level retail. The building was renamed *Icon Norfolk*, part of a larger project known as CityWalk which would redeveloped an adjacent office building at 2 Commercial Place.

In August 2016, Bank of America announced its relocatation to 999 Waterside Drive, the former Dominion Tower, several blocks away. The tower was then remodeled as *Icon Norfolk Apartments*, and the address was modified to 321 E. Main Street.
