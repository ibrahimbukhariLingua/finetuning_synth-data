## Career

While at Cal State, Navellier took part in a research project in which the goal was to mimic the S&P 500’s performance. During this project Navellier discovered some methods beating the market using quantitative and fundamental analysis.

Navellier employs a three-step, highly disciplined, bottom-up stock selection process, focusing on quantitative analysis, fundamental analysis, and optimization of the securities selected for the portfolio. In 1980, Mr. Navellier began publishing his research in his stock advisory newsletter, the MPT Review. Since 1987, he has been active in the management of individual portfolios, mutual funds, and institutional portfolios.

In 1980, Navellier began publishing *MPT Review*, a monthly newsletter for individual investors. In 1997 he partnered with publisher InvestorPlace Media, LLC (formerly Phillips Investment Resources, LLC) to launch *The Blue Chip Growth Letter*, which applied the investment strategy used in *MPT Review* to strictly blue chip stocks. In January 2005 Navellier and InvestorPlace Media re-launched *MPT Review*, renaming it *Emerging Growth*. *The Hulbert Financial Digest* rated the Emerging Growth newsletter as the number one performer in the 20-year category from 1985–2005, among 32 surviving newsletters. Hulbert estimated that from 1985 through 2008, following the advice of that newsletter would have resulted in a gain of about 2,156% according to *The Hulbert Financial Digest*. During the same time period the S&P 500 index had an increase of about 869%. He and InvestorPlace Media also publish the *Quantum Growth* and *Global Growth* newsletters.

On Jan. 23, 2009, Louis Navellier launched an exchange-traded fund, the RevenueShares Navellier Overall A-100 Fund (ticker symbol RWV). This ETF searched a database of nearly 5,000 stocks for the best companies according to Navellier's top fundamental factors such as sales growth, earnings growth and cash flow. The ETF holdings were rebalanced quarterly. In honor of the new fund, Louis Navellier rang the opening bell on Wall Street for New York Stock Exchange on Friday, February 13, 2009.

In 2017, the SEC charged Navellier for fraud for falsifying the firm’s track record in marketing materials. He denies the charges.

In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced final judgment on its fraud charges against investment adviser Navellier & Associates, Inc. and its founder and chief investment officer, Louis Navellier. Following the ruling of a federal district court in Massachusetts that found the plaintiffs guilty of "breach[ing] their fiduciary duties and defraud[ing] their advisory clients and prospective clients."
