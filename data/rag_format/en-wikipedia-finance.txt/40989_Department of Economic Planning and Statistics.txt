## History

On 21 May 1973, the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) was founded under the State Secretariat Office. On 1 January 1976, the Economic Development Board (EDB) was created. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) received the Computer Section of EPU on 1 January 1993, and the Insurance Section of EDB on 14 March 1993, when they were transferred to the Financial Institution Division of the MoF. On 7 March 1995, the EDB's Tourism Section was shifted to the Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources, and on 31 March 1995, a few EDB employees were transferred to the Development Bank of Brunei. On 15 June 1996, the Ministry of Home Affairs' Weight and Measures Section was merged into EPU.

Following this, on 1 January 1997, EPU and EDB combined to become the **Department of Economic Planning and Development** (DEPD), which is housed inside the MoF. DEPD and the Secretariat of the Brunei Darussalam Economic Council (BDEC) were combined into a single department under the Prime Minister's Office from 1 March 2001, till 2018. The DEPD was renamed the **Department of Economic Planning and Statistics** (DEPS) in 2019 and moved to the MoFE.


## Legislation


### Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Order (2011)

Customers are protected from dishonest acts by merchants under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Order, 2011 (CPTFO). It covers topics including making false promises, misleading or deceiving customers, and taking advantage of those who are weak to defend their own interests or comprehend the deal. CPTFO is applicable to transactions done in or out of Brunei, as well as to enterprises and consumers there. Customers who buy products or services for their own use rather than for resale are particularly protected from unfair business-to-consumer (B2C) activities.

CPTFO excludes transactions involving estate property, employment services, and those already regulated by other Brunei regulations or agencies. To stop unfair practices, companies may be urged to sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA), which might contain promises to refund expenses or make good on lost profits to customers and be made public by the media. On 1 January 2012, the CPFTO went into effect with two regulations and twenty sections.


### Price Control Act, Chapter 142

After being first implemented on 13 March 1974, and going through many revisions, the Price Control Act (Cap 142) was further modified on 13 November 2012, with the passage of the Price Control Act (Amendment) Order 2012. The 2012 amendment's goals are to restrict appropriate price rises, guarantee fair promotional activities, assist the building sector and general national growth, and regulate the cost of necessities for low-income Bruneians. The act specifies that business premises that fail to show price tags for specific goods supplied there and sold at a price higher than the maximum amount determined after an inspection will get warning notices. There is a B$1,000 maximum penalties for noncompliance. Repeat offenders may be fined up to B$20,000 and imprisoned for a maximum of five years.

With effect from 23 November, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah issued the Price Control Act (Amendment) Order 2021, which updated and strengthened enforcement procedures to better reflect the state of the economy. The Price Control (Maximum Prices and Charges) (Amendment) Order 2021 and the Price Control (Minimum Price and Charges) (Repeal) Order 2021 are also amended by the amendment, enabling DEPS to oversee and enforce pricing, particularly in times of emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Retailers will be penalised for not cooperating with inspections and supplying information; moreover, the list of regulated products will be revised on a regular basis to include government-subsidised items.
