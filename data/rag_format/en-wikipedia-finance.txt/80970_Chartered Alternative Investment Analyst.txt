Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst


# Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst



**Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst** (**CAIA**) (pronounced "KAI-ah") is a professional designation offered by the CAIA Association to investment professionals who complete a course of study and pass two examinations. The "alternative investments" industry is characterized as dealing with asset classes and investments other than standard equity or fixed income products. Alternative investments can include hedge funds, private equity, real assets, commodities, and structured products.

The Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst Association was founded in 2002 by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets (CISDM). As of 2024, there are over 13,000 CAIA members. CAIA designees are required to maintain membership in the CAIA Association and adhere to professional and ethical standards.
