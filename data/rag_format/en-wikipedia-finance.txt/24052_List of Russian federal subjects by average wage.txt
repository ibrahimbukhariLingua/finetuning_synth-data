List of Russian federal subjects by average wage


# List of Russian federal subjects by average wage



Starting from 2020, the median per capita income is calculated in Russia, based on the size of which the subsistence minimum and minimum wage are also calculated. The median salary is the median (average) salary at which half (50%) of workers in Russia or a region receive less than this level, and half (50%) receive more than it. This indicator more accurately reflects the situation than the average monthly salary according to Rosstat (Russian Federal State Statistics Service). So, according to Sberindex in 2020, the median salary for all industries in Russia amounted to 31,540 rubles or $500 per month in January and 38,278 rubles or $520 per month in December. In January 2021, it amounted to 33,549 rubles or $441 per month, in December 2021 - 42,801 rubles or $578 per month. In January 2022, the median salary was 37,429 rubles or $481 per month, in December 2022 - 49,627 rubles or $708.50 per month.

In January 2023, the median salary was 43,500 rubles or $630 per month. In July 2023 was 53,571 rubles ($591.90) per month. On June 16, 2023, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Tatyana Golikova, during a speech at the session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF-23), reported that about 6 million employed Russians receive salaries below the minimum wage (minimum wage) (below 16,242 rubles or $195.60 per month) and about 12 million Russians work without employment contracts, or contracts of a civil nature (GPH), or the status of self-employed As of April 2023, about half of Russians complain about too low wages and want to get twice as much. Analysts of HeadHunter came to such conclusions. In general, 71% of the country's inhabitants are dissatisfied with their earnings. Only a quarter (26%) of the working population of the Russian Federation is satisfied with the size of the monthly pay . According to VTsIOM polls in 2023, Russians believe that the growth of poverty in Russia (20 million materially, financially poor people in Russia) is due to the unfair distribution of resources, the liquidation of enterprises and social inequality. In Russia, wages are about 39% of GDP, while in most European countries this figure is above 50%.

In recent years, it was believed that low wages are a competitive advantage of the Russian economy, since it is beneficial for doing business, and poverty can be "cured" by payments to vulnerable citizens. But the budget will spend 1.6 trillion rubles only on a single benefit in 2024. "This support measure is not cheap for the state. If the number of recipients of benefits continues to grow, a policy where benefits are the main tool for fighting poverty will become an additional risk to budget stability," Vice-Rector of the Higher School of Economics Lilia Ovcharova warned.

Also the following article is about the average salaries by Russian federal subjects. The article shows the latest data published by Rosstat of June 2022.


## List of federal subjects by average monthly gross wage

In all regions, wages and expenses for food, housing and communal services are approximately equal. Since the higher the salary in the region, the higher the costs. This does not apply to Moscow: food prices are equal to food prices in other regions with lower wages. Citizens of Russia living in different regions sometimes find themselves in very different conditions. In some areas, due to climatic reasons, the cost of living is much higher, while working and living conditions are much more difficult and are associated with additional burdens on people's health. In this regard, in some regions of the country, a district coefficient is required for wages (surcharge, compensation to an employee for working in difficult climatic conditions or in connection with other costs). These regions include: the southern part of the East Siberian region; Far East; The Far North and regions similar in status to it.

Average salary per month in the regions in beginning of 2023 as published by Rosstat . Since the exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar fluctuates widely, figures in rubles are converted into international dollars using the PPP conversion factor at a rate of 26.67 rubles per international dollar (per the World Bank ).
