The **exclusive economic zone of Somalia** covers 830,389 kmÂ² in the Indian Ocean.

## Legislation


### Law No. 37 on the Territorial Sea and Ports

On 10 September 1972, the Parliament of Somalia passed Law No. 37 on the Territorial Sea and Ports. The bill extended Somalia's territorial sea to 200 nautical miles within the continental and insular coasts. On 26 January 1989, the parliament passed legislation Law. 05, which approved the Somali Maritime Law (the Somali Maritime Law of 1988). The bill provides for a 200 nm territorial sea and exclusive economic zone.


### United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea

The treaty defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the world's oceans, and establishes guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine Natural resources. The 1982 UNCLOS provides for a territorial sea of up to 12 nm and an EEZ of up to 200 nm.

## Natural resources

Somalia has the longest coastline on mainland Africa, and some of the continent's richest fish stocks. The abundance in fisheries in the area is a result of the coastal upwelling of cold nutrient-rich subsurface oceanic waters. The upwelling results in the enrichment of phytoplankton and zooplankton, which, in turn, make the conditions favorable for some small pelagic fish such as sardines, herring, and scad.
