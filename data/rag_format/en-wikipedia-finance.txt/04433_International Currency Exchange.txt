# International Currency Exchange



**International Currency Exchange** - often known simply as 'ICE' - was a global foreign currency exchange company, based in London.


## Background

ICE was the first foreign exchange operator to offer a pre-paid currency card and also to offer a voucher system, whereby customers are able to get discounted exchange rates by visiting the company's website before picking up their currency.

As one of the largest retail currency exchange operators in the world, with a combined annual group turnover in excess of US$1.8 billion, ICE operated a global network of over 300 bureaux de change branches, including 65 airports, across four continents.

ICE is a Private Limited Company owned by Lenlyn Group, and is a sister company of Raphaels Bank. The organisation's headquarters are in Piccadilly, London.

ICE UK ceased trading in 2022, going into administration as a result of the Covid restrictions; ICE retains operations in other locations including the USA and Ireland.
