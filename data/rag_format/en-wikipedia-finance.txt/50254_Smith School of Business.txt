## Naming

On October 1, 2015, the Queen's School of Business was renamed the Stephen J.R. Smith School of Business in recognition of a $50-million donation from Stephen J. R. Smith, a graduate of the Queen's University's Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. The donation is the largest gift ever made to a Canadian business school, growing the school's endowment from $54 million to $104 million. As of 2015, this will result in Smith being a close second in total endowment among Canadian business schools, next to only the Rotman School of Management.


## History

Queen's University launched its undergraduate business program in 1919, making it the oldest Bachelor of Commerce in Canada. The first woman to earn an undergraduate business degree, Beatrice Eakins, graduated from the program in 1922 alongside six other students. The MBA program was launched in 1960. Queen's School of Business became its own faculty in 1963, with Lawrence MacPherson as the first dean. The school was accredited by the AACSB in 1998, and it was the first program in Ontario to be accredited by the AACSB.


## Location

The majority of business classes are held in Goodes Hall. Opened in 2002, the building is named in honour of the family of Melvin Goodes, a Commerce ‘57 alumnus and former Chairman and CEO of Warner–Lambert. In September 2012, a significant expansion of Goodes Hall was completed, increasing the size of the building by 75,000 ft² to a total of 188,000 ft². The expansion included new classrooms, breakout rooms, and 51 additional faculty offices.

The Smith School of Business opened its first foreign campus in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, at the DIFC on May 25, 2007. Classes started in October 2007. The campus mainly hosts Queen's executive development programs.
