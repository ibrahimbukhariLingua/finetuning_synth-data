# Philippine Stock Exchange



The **Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc.** (Filipino: *Pamilihang Sapi ng Pilipinas*; PSE: PSE) is the national stock exchange of the Philippines. The exchange was created in 1992 from the merger of the **Manila Stock Exchange** and the **Makati Stock Exchange**. Including previous forms, the exchange has been in operation since 1927. The PSE's headquarters is located at the Philippine Stock Exchange Tower, located along the One Bonifacio High Street complex in Bonifacio Global City.

The Philippine Stock Exchange is currently owned and managed by The Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc., a company that is also listed on the exchange (PSE: PSE), which is responsible for managing the entire stock exchange, and currently has a total of 285 listed companies. The main index for the PSE is the PSE Composite Index (PSEi) composed of thirty (30) listed companies. The selection of companies in the PSEi is based on a specific set of criteria ranging from total capitalization to minimum number of stockholders upon its planned listing. There are also six additional sector-based indices. The PSE is overseen by a 15-member board of directors, chaired by José T. Pardo.


## History

On February 3, 1936, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had "relinquished control of the Manila Stock Exchange."

The Philippine Stock Exchange was formed on December 23, 1995, from the merger of the Manila Stock Exchange (MSE) (established on August 12, 1927, based on Muelle de la Industria, Binondo, Manila) and the Makati Stock Exchange (MkSE) (established on May 15, 1963, based in the Makati Central Business District, within Ayala Tower One). Both exchanges traded the same stocks of the same companies.

In June 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted the PSE a "Self-Regulatory Organization" (SRO) status, which meant that the bourse can implement its own rules and establish penalties on erring trading participants (TPs) and listed companies.

In 2001, the PSE was transformed from a non-profit, non-stock, member-governed organization into a shareholder-based, revenue-earning corporation headed by a president and a board of directors and on December 15, 2003, listed its own shares on the exchange (traded under the ticker symbol **PSE**).

On March 28, 2022, The Philippine Stock Exchange launched the PSE Thematic Index Series, with two new indices, namely PSE Dividend Yield Index, and PSE MidCap Index.

## Business

On January 4, 1993, the former Manila Stock Exchange started the computerization of its operations using the Stratus Trading System (STS) with a company called Equicom. On June 15, the former Makati Stock Exchange adopted the MakTrade trading system. Both systems were linked on March 25, 1994, to produce a One Price-One Market exchange. Two years later, on November 13, 1995, the implementation of the Unified Trading System (UTS) allowed the use of a single-order-book system on a MakTrade software where all the orders are posted and matched in one computer. They have nearly 10,000 employees.

In October 2004, the Securities Clearing Corporation of the Philippines (SCCP), a clearing and settlement agency for depository eligible trades, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the PSE. The SCCP acts as the settlement coordinator and risk manager for broker transactions as well as administrator of the trade guaranty fund.

In 2005, the PSE adopted an online daily disclosure system (ODiSy) to improve the transparency of listed companies and ensure full, fair, timely and accurate disclosure of material information from all listed companies. The ODiSy provides a 24/7 online system access for the submission of all types of disclosures.

On July 26, 2010, the PSE launched its new trading system, PSEtrade, which replaced the MakTrade system. The system was acquired from the New York Stock Exchange.

## Current trading floors

Trading on the PSE pre-opens at 9:00 A.M.; opens at 9:30 A.M.; is in recess between 12:00 and 1:30 P.M.; pre-closes at 3:15 P.M.; in run-off from 3:20 P.M.; and closes at 3:30 P.M.

The unified trading floor's final location was the Philippine Stock Exchange Tower (PSE Tower), the new headquarters of the PSEi, located in One Bonifacio High Street, Bonifacio Global City, replacing the two trading floors in Metro Manila: one at its headquarters at the PSE Plaza Ayala Triangle, Ayala Tower One in the Makati Central Business District (Makati Stock Exchange); and one at the Philippine Stock Exchange Centre (Tektite Towers), Ortigas Center in Pasig (Manila Stock Exchange).

However, the Philippine Stock Exchange permanently closed its trading floor in Bonifacio Global City on Friday, June 24, 2022; it would start floor-less trading the following Monday, June 27, 2022. PSE made the decision following the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021; according to the organization, the pandemic and the lockdowns proved that off-site transactions can be made, thus making the existence of a trading floor moot. PSE also said that the closure of the trading floor was done to embrace digitalization.
