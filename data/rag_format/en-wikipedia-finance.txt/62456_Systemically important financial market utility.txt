Systemically important financial market utility


# Systemically important financial market utility



**Systemically important financial market utilities** (**SIFMUs**) are entities whose failure or disruption could threaten the stability of the United States financial system. To date eight entities in the U.S. have been officially designated SIFMUs.


## Legislative background

Section 804 of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (DFA) provides the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) the authority to designate a financial market utility (FMU) that it determines is or is likely to become systemically important because the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of the FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the United States financial system.


## Implications

SIFMU status places an entity under enhanced regulatory oversight by the three agencies charged with regulating SIFMUs—the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

On October 28, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board finalized its revisions to the SIFMU risk management standards. The final rule expands the implications for SIFMUs and includes:

* Heightened standards for boards of directors;
* Comprehensive risk management framework expectations;
* Expanded recovery and resolution plan requirements;
* Rules and procedures requirements for liquidity shortfalls;
* Broader risk management requirements; and
* Enhanced disclosure requirements for financial market infrastructures.
