Infrastructure UK


# Infrastructure UK



**Infrastructure UK** (**IUK**) was a division of HM Treasury within the Treasury's Public Services and Growth Directorate, which advised the UK government on the long-term infrastructure needs of the UK and provided commercial expertise to support major projects and programmes between 2010 and 2016.
