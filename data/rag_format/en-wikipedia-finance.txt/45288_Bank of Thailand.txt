# Bank of Thailand



The **Bank of Thailand** (**BOT**; abbr. ธปท.; Thai: ธนาคารแห่งประเทศไทย, RTGS: **thanakhan haeng prathet thai**) is the central bank of Thailand.


## History

The Bank of Thailand (BOT) was first set up as the Thai National Banking Bureau. The Bank of Thailand Act was promulgated on 28 April 1942 vesting upon the Bank of Thailand the responsibility for all central banking functions. The Bank of Thailand started operations on 10 December 1942.

The Bank of Thailand Act, B.E. 2485 was later amended in order to put emphasis on its social responsibility, to create a mechanism to guard against economic crisis, as well as to set up its decision making process to ensure good governance and transparency in the organization. The Bank of Thailand Act, B.E. 2551 came into force on 4 March 2008.


### Project Nexus

Bank Indonesia was involved as a special observer. The platform, which is expected to go live by 2026, will interlink domestic fast payment systems of the member countries.


## Roles and responsibilities
