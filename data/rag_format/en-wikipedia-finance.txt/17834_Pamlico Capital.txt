## Spinout from Wells Fargo

Founded as First Union Capital Partners in 1988, the firm served as the private equity investment arm of First Union, a commercial bank based in Charlotte. The firm changed its name to Wachovia Capital Partners following the merger of First Union and Wachovia in 2001, under Managing Partners Scott Perperᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ, currently serving as Head of Pamlico Capital, and Ted Gardner.

In 2005, Frederick (Eric) W. Eubankᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ and L. Watts Hamrickᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ, among the original partners at conception of First Union Capital Partners, were named Managing Partners of the firm alongside Scott Perper, Chief Financial Officer Tracey M. Chaffinᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ, and Partners: Art C. Roselle, Walker C. Simmons, and Scott R. Stevens; all of whom remain with the firm to date.

As a captive private equity investment arm, the firm focused on growth capital, leveraged buyout and mezzanine capital investments in middle-market companies across a range of industries. The firm invested both as the lead investor or an equity co-investor alongside other financial sponsors.

During the financial crisis of 2008, the firm's parent, Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo, which had an existing private equity platform, *Norwest Equity Partners*. In March 2010, the firm completed a spinout from Wells Fargo.
