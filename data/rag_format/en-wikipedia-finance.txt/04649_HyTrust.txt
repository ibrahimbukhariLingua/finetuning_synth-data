## Products and services

HyTrust's products are based on the company's patented intelligent security control system for virtualized ecosystems.

HyTrust CloudControl is a VMware vSphere-compatible virtual appliance that sits between the virtual infrastructure and its administrators. Whenever an administrative request is submitted to the infrastructure, the appliance determines whether that request complies with the organization's security policies before permitting or denying it accordingly.
By logging all requests, records are produced that can be used for regulatory compliance and auditing, troubleshooting, and forensic analysis.

The company also provides private cloud, logging, active directory, root access, two-factor authentication, VI segmentation, host hardening, multi-tenant policy enforcement, secondary approval services, encryption, and key management and advises organizations on how to manage their virtualized and cloud computing environments.

HyTrust partnered with Intel in 2014 to create HyTrust BoundaryControl. The technology lets companies set policies to control access to cloud and virtualized IT where data can be stored. BoundaryCountrol is designed to work with the Intel TXT technology.

The company released HyTrust DataControl 3.0 in 2015. The technology encrypts data on virtual machines while they are at rest and keeps the data secure until being used.
