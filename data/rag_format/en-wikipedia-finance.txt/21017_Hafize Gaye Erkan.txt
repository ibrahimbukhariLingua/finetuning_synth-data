## Central Bank of Turkey

After the re-election of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in May 2023 and the appointment of Mehmet Şimşek as the new Minister of Finance, the media reported that Central Bank governor Şahap Kavcıoğlu would be replaced by Erkan. On 8 June 2023, Erkan became the governor by a presidential decree by Erdoğan, becoming the first female head of the Turkish Central Bank.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed Erkan as the new central bank governor on June 8, 2023, replacing Sahap Kavcioglu who served as governor since March 20, 2021. Under her leadership, the central bank turned away from Erdogan's imposition of low interest rates that had caused soaring inflation and turned away foreign investors in favor of increasing the rates to 45% from the previous 8.5%, which the bank said had stopped inflation by January 2024.

In late 2023 Erkan told a local newspaper that house prices in Istanbul are higher than Manhattan, so she chose to move in with her parents.

On 2 February, Erkan announced her resignation from the central bank following an article published in the newspaper *Sözcü* that said one of the bank's employees had been fired at the instigation of Erkan's father. Erkan called the report "a major reputation assassination campaign". The following day, she was removed from office by the President and replaced by then Deputy Governor Fatih Karahan.
