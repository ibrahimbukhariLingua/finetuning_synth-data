## History

The predecessor of the trust company was founded in December 1983 as **Hebei International Trust Investment Corporation** (Chinese: 河北省国际信托投资公司). In 2004 the company was re-registered as **Hebei International Trust & Investment Co., Ltd.** (Chinese: 河北省国际信托投资有限责任公司), which Hebei Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission was the largest shareholder for 95.24% stake. In 2006 it was acquired by HNA Group from Hebei Provincial People's Government [zh]; the share capital of the company had increased to CN¥2 billion in 2010 and to CN¥3.6 billion in 2016. The company also changed from "company limited by quote/stake" to "company limited by shares" (analog to public limited company) in 2015.

In 2012 China Xinhua Airlines also acquired the minority stake (795.65 million shares) from HNA Hospitality Group, Tangla Hotel Beijing [zh], Haikou Meilan International Airport Co., Ltd. and 2 sister companies, for a total price of CN¥2.761 billion (CN¥3.47 per share). China Xinhua Airlines did not subscribed the 2016 capital increase of the trust company, making the shares were diluted to 22.10%.

In November 2017, Bohai Trust was sued for failing to pay the collective funds trust plan for the Bohai Trust Ningbo Weitong Investment Project, which was originally scheduled to expire on July 27, 2017.
