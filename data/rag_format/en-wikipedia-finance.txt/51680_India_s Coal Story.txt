Richa Mishra, writing for *Business Line*, has called the book as "heavy on facts with a play-it-safe approach". She wrote that book has an interesting compilation of facts and author did a "neat balancing act to his credit". Indrani Dutta in *The Hindu* has praised the work, but pointed out a few factual inaccuracies.

K Yatish Rajawat, writing for *The Financial Express*, wrote that book represents the research about subject without being didactic and dense.
