## Accreditations

ESC Clermont is a *Grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, *Grandes Écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although they are more expensive than public universities in France, *Grandes Écoles* typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the *Grandes Écoles*. Many of the top ranked business schools in Europe are members of the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* *(CGE)*, as is ESC Clermont, and out of the 250 business schools in France, only 39 are *CGE* members.

Degrees from ESC Clermont are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France)(French: *Le Ministère de L'éducation Nationale*). ESC Clermont is further triply accredited by the elite international business school accrediting organizations: The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), Association of MBAs (AMBA) and European Foundation for Management Development.
