## History

Stibbe's story began over a century ago when its two founders established law firms in their respective countries. David. W. Stibbe started a firm in Amsterdam in 1911, and Henri Simont Sr., established a firm in Belgium in the early part of the 20th century. The Dutch part of the firm was founded in 1911 by H.W. Stibbe. The Belgian part of Stibbe was established by Henri Simont sr. In 1991, Stibbe, Blaisse & De Jong in Amsterdam merged with Simont & Simont in Brussels and became Stibbe & Simont, one of the most prominent law firms in the Benelux. After merging with the Paris-based Monahan & Duhot in 1993, the firm was renamed Stibbe Simont Monahan Duhot. A few years later, the firm's name had simply become Stibbe. Stibbe's Luxembourg office was set up in 2010.
Today, Stibbe has main offices in Amsterdam, Brussels and Luxembourg and branch offices in London.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Brussels office won in 2014 the Chambers Europe Award for Excellence for Belgium and in 2015 the Belgian Law Firm of the Year Award by IFLR1000. In 2018, both the Dutch and the Belgian office were awarded the Chambers Law Firm of the Year Award.

The British law firm Herbert Smith had a partnership with Stibbe and the German firm Gleiss Lutz until 2011; Herbert Smith's intention was to merge with the other two firms, but they refused its overtures.
