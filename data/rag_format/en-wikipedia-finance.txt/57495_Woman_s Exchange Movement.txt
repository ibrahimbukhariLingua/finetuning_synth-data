Woman's Exchange Movement


# Woman's Exchange Movement



The **Woman's Exchange Movement** (or **Women's Exchange Movement**) refers to a system of benevolent consignment stores, usually established and managed by women, to benefit women. A number of them are members of the **Federation of Woman's Exchanges** (1934), which is still active.


## Background

The Woman's Exchange Movement in the United States dates to 1832, with the establishment of the Philadelphia Ladies' Depository.

Exchanges are non-profit establishments. In the 19th century they were mainly set up by philanthropic women, providing a setting for women to sell their embroidery, sewing, and fancywork. This allowed women to earn a living without working outside their homes.¹ Initially, the exchanges in Philadelphia and New Brunswick appear to have catered for women who had seen better days and had now become self-supporting. At the time it was socially unacceptable for "genteel women" to work and the Women's Exchanges allowed them to sell their work anonymously. The managers and organizers of the exchanges added to their philanthropic status.² These women were also able to use their entrepreneurial skills in a socially acceptable way.³

Many exchanges added tearooms and lunchrooms, which provided more revenue and became fashionable meeting places for upper-class women.⁹⁵ While almost all the exchanges were unsuccessful as businesses, they nevertheless set high standards for the items they accepted, charging a commission of only 10 percent on sales. Consumers were therefore able to benefit from an interesting selection of hand-made articles at interesting prices.

While many depositories and exchanges were local or regional operations, the Federation of Woman's Exchanges was established in 1934 and is still active. While the Woman's Exchange Movement continued through the twentieth century and some exchanges are still in business, the movement has faded, due to a changing work force, rising rents, and a resistance to high-priced, hand-made merchandise.
