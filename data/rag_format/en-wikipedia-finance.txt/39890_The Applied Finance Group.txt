# The Applied Finance Group



**The Applied Finance Group** (AFG) is an American institutional equity research firm founded in 1995 by Rafael Resendes and Dan Obrycki.


## History

In 1995 Rafael Resendes and Daniel Obrycki founded the Applied Finance Group in Chicago, Illinois as an independent research company. AFG sought to build a more sophisticated Value Based Metric to measure a company's true economic profit. With that goal in mind, AFG developed its proprietary framework, Economic Margin (EM), to evaluate corporate performance from an economic cash flow perspective. In 2001, Morningstar, Inc. adopted AFG's Methodology to launch the Morningstar Rating for stocks.
AFG expanded to its second office in Fresno, California in 2003. Resendes relocated to work as head of the Fresno Office, while Obrycki managed from Chicago.

In 2004, AFG created a large cap model portfolio of stocks called the AFG50. AFG created the AFG50 portfolio to provide Trust Departments and small RIAs a product that could serve as an outsource/research team. Later that year AFG partnered with Chief Executive Magazine and Drew Morris, CEO of "Great Numbers!", to launch the Chief Executive/Applied Finance Group Wealth Creation Rankings, a research instrument used to rank companies based on their value and ability to create value. In 2009 AFG began providing research internationally for the first time in the company's history.
