South Korean won (1945–1953)


# South Korean won (1945–1953)



The **won** (Korean: 원) was the first South Korean currency and was in use from August 15, 1945, to February 15, 1953.


## Etymology

**Won** is a cognate of the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen. The won was subdivided into 100 jeon (전; 錢; McCune-Reischauer: *chŏn*; revised: *jeon*).


## History

Following the end of the Colonial Era and the division of Korea, the won was introduced to replace the Korean yen. The first banknotes were issued by the Bank of Joseon until 1950, when the currency management switched to the Bank of Korea.

At the time of its introduction in 1945 the won was pegged to the Japanese yen at a rate of *1 won = 1 yen*. In October of the same year the anchor currency was changed to the US dollar at a rate of *15 won = 1 dollar*. Toward the end of the Korean War the won was devalued at *6000 won = 1 dollar*. Following that the hwan was introduced as the new currency at a rate of *1 hwan = 100 won*.


## Coins

No coins were issued by South Korea during this period; however, Japanese 1 sen coins continued to be used for small transactions until February 1953. South Korea would eventually introduce its first coins for circulation in 1959.


## Banknotes


### Bank of Joseon issued notes

The won was subdivided into 100 *jeon*. Only banknotes were issued. Initially, the won was issued by Bank of Joseon with a similar design to the older notes of the Japanese occupation period. However, there were two subtle and important differences. The new notes replaced the paulownia, the badge of the government of Japan, with the Rose of Sharon, South Korea's national flower; and the clause about exchangeability with the Japanese yen was removed.

### Bank of Korea issued notes

On June 12, 1950, the Bank of Korea was established and assumed the duties of Bank of Joseon. The Bank of Joseon's notes were still kept in circulation as not all denominations were replaced by the Bank of Korea's notes.
