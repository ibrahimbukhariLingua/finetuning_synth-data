New France livre


# New France livre



The ***livre*** was the currency of New France, the French colony in modern-day Canada. It was subdivided into 20 *sols*, each of 12 *deniers*. The New France *livre* was a French colonial currency, distinguished by the use of paper money.


## History

After an initial period during which barter prevailed, the French livre began to circulate. In order to encourage coins into the colony, those circulating in New France were valued at a premium, creating a *monnoye de pays* (French *monnaie de pays* in Modern French) worth less than the French currency (*monnoye de France*, *monnaie de France* in Modern French). The premium was set at one-eighth in 1664, raised to one-third in 1680. The New France currency was distinguished by the extensive use of paper money. However, early issues did not maintain their value. In 1717, the premium for coins was abolished, the card money was redeemed at half its face value and the New France *livre* was set equal to the French *livre*. Further paper money was issued. In the 1750s, the backing of paper money by coins was discontinued, causing the hoarding of coins. Following the British conquest of New France, the paper money lost its value and the *livre* was replaced by the pound.


## Coins

A variety of coins circulated in New France, including Spanish dollars, Spanish reales and Spanish colonial reales. In 1670, silver 5 and 15 *sols* were introduced for use in New France. In 1709, billon 30-*denier* coins were issued in the colony, followed by billon 15 *deniers* in 1711. Copper 9 *deniers* followed in 1722. In 1738, billon 1- and 2-*sol* coins were introduced in France which also circulated in New France. These coins were also known as 1⁄2 and 1 *sols marqués*.


## Banknotes

In 1685, "card money" was introduced. These were simple notes, hand written on the back of playing cards, which were used due to a shortage of coins. The first issue was redeemed after 3 months. Despite the French authorities' displeasure, further issues were made into the 1690s. Inflation reduced the card money's value, until it was redeemed at half face value in 1717.

In the 1720s, the government introduced promissory notes, known as *ordonances*. Card money was reintroduced in 1729. Denominations of 6, 12 and 24 *livres* were issued in 1729, followed by 30 *sols* in 1733, 20 *sols* in 1734, 3 *livres* in 1742, and 7+1⁄2 and 15 *sols* in 1749. In 1753, treasury notes were introduced (also known as *ordonances*). 48-*livre* notes were introduced in 1753, followed by 20 *sols* in 1754, 3 and 24 *livres* in 1756, 12 and 96 *livres* in 1757, and 6 *livres* in 1758.
