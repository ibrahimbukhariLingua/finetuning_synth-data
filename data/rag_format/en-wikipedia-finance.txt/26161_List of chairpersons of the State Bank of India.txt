List of chairpersons of the State Bank of India


# List of chairpersons of the State Bank of India



The **chairperson of the State Bank of India** is the chief executive officer of India's largest scheduled commercial bank and the *ex-officio* chair of its Central Board of Directors. Since its establishment in 1955 by the government of India, the State Bank of India has been headed by twenty-seven chairpersons.

The term of office typically runs for three years and can, in some cases, be extended for another two years. However, in practice, only four Chairmen, Raj Kumar Talwar, O. P. Bhatt, Arundhati Bhattacharya and Dinesh Kumar Khara had their terms extended. Arundhati Bhattacharya was also the first female chairperson of the bank and continues to be the only woman to have held that post.

The inaugural officeholder was the Indian railway minister John Matthai, while Raj Kumar Talwar holds the unique distinction of having been in office for the longest time. H. V. R. Iengar and P. C. Bhattacharya also held the post of governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Borra Venkatappaiah also held the post of the Deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India.

Although the State Bank of India, through its predecessors, the Imperial Bank of India and others, has existed in some form since 1806, this article strives to list only those chairmen who have headed the bank since its formation in its modern form, that is since 1955.

Challa Sreenivasulu Setty is the current chairman of the State Bank of India since 28 August 2024.
