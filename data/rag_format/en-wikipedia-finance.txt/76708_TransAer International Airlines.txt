# TransAer International Airlines



**TransAer International Airlines** was an Irish charter airline headquartered in the TransAer House, Dublin Airport, Dublin, Ireland.


## History

The airline was previously known as Translift Airways.¹⁰⁴ It was established in October 1991 and started operations in February 1992.¹⁰⁵ Renaming took place on 10 April 1997.¹⁰⁴ It was the brainchild of P. J. McGoldrick (who later went on to run Ryanair and EUjet).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The airline operated a number of Airbus A300B4 and Airbus A320-200 aircraft.¹⁰⁵ Some Boeing 727, Boeing 757 and Boeing 737-200 were also operated for a short period of time.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The company leased aircraft to Libyan Arab Airlines and Khalifa Airways.

TransAer went into liquidation on 20 October 2000. Prior to the collapse, an 18-month contract was signed in 2000 to help set up a new airline in Kosovo. The collapse was blamed on the adverse effects of the Kosovo war, a failed $18 million investment in American airline TransMeridian and losses of $14 million incurred by TransAer's German and Greek charter airline business. The business failed with outstanding debts of £30 million and made 450 employees redundant.

Two of their aircraft were impounded in Ireland by Aer Rianta the day after the airline appointed a liquidator, due to TransAer's failure to pay landing and handling fees amounting to over £200,000.
