## History

Dilip Buildcon Limited (DBL) was founded in 1987 in Bhopal by Dilip Suryavanshi as a proprietorship concern called Dilip Builders. The company was incorporated as Dilip Buildcon Private Limited on 12 June 2006 as a private limited company under the Companies Act 1956 with the Registrar of Companies Gwalior. Subsequently, the company took over the business of Dilip Builders, a sole proprietorship concern, in 2007. The company registered as a public limited company in August 2010. In the initial years of its operation, the company focused on commercial and residential building projects in Madhya Pradesh.

As business grew in the early 1990s, the company forayed into other types of construction. The first move was into water sanitation and sewage.

The company also did structural designing and construction in the field of the oil and gas industry. At the end of the 1990s, when the new central government put forward a vision of connecting the country with roads, DBL ventured into road construction starting with a small road project.

From 2012, the company started pursuing bigger road projects across the country. In the meantime, the government came up with the PPP model for roads inviting attention from other industries into the sector. DBL invested in procuring the road building equipment from around the world.

In August 2016, Dilip Buildcon became a publicly-listed company through an initial public offering (IPO), and got listed on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE).
