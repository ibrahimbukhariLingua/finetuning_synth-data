SM&A grew out of the need for new designs and programs called for in this era.

From 1990 to 1994, the company grew by 44%, despite previous speculation that the end of the Cold War would slow the growth of the defense sector.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ From 1995 to 1997, SM&A grew in terms of client diversification and infrastructure growth. The company now needed the capability to support over 40 proposals in a year along with proposal services. Their program services department grew heavily, accounting for 20% of the $37 million in revenue the company was bringing in.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
