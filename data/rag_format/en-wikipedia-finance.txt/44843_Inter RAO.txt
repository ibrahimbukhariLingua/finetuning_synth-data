## History

Inter RAO was established in 1997 as a subsidiary of the Russian unified power company RAO UES. Its initial focus was international energy trading.

In 2002, Inter RAO started exporting electricity from Russia and generating its own electricity.

In 2005, Inter RAO made several acquisitions:

* 50% stake in Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station
* 25% plus 1 shares North-West Thermal Power Plant
* 70% stake in TGR Energy
* 51% stake in the Cuciurgan power station

In early 2008, Inter RAO obtainted listings on the Russian stock exchanges MICEX and RTS. As a part of its reorganization, Inter RAO received several Russian power generation facilities including Sochi Thermal Power Plant, North-West Thermal Power Plant, Ivanovo CCPP and Kaliningrad CHPP-2. In the same year, Inter RAO purchased the remaining 49% stake in the Cuciurgan power station.

In following years, the Government of Russia transferred the power companies shares remaining after the reform of RAO UES in the property of state-owned companies RusHydro, FGC UES, Rosimushchestvo, and Rosneftegaz to Inter RAO. That included transfer of 41% stake in Irkutskenergo, 65.8% of OGK-1, 3.24% of OGK-4, 26.43% of OGK-5, 24.9% of TGC-6, 34.21% of TGC-7, 30.54% of TGC-11, 20.24% of Kuzbassenergo, 21.27% of Bashkirenergo, 14.48% of Sangtuda 1 Hydroelectric Power Plant (in Tajikistan), and 100% of Razdan Thermal Power Plant (in Armenia).

On 13 May 2022, Inter RAO subsidiary RAO Nordic announced to suspend deliveries of electricity to Finland and stopped them at midnight. The announcement came one day after Finland's president Sauli Niinistö and prime minister Sanna Marin had expressed their support for Finnish membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The move fits an ongoing pattern of economic sanctions and counter-sanctions in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
