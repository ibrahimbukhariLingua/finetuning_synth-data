DBEA's purpose is "enhancing the economic vitality of the State of New Hampshire and promoting it as a destination for domestic and international visitors." DBEA oversees two other state agencies:

In April 2021, DBEA announced the creation of an Office of Outdoor Recreation Industry Development (ORID), to connect the state's "outdoor assets to broad economic development strategies such as workforce and business recruitment."
