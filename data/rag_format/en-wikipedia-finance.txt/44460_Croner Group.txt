## History


### Early history

Croner Publications Ltd. was established in 1941 by Ulrich Horst Edward Croner. The Company's first publication was a newsletter, *Shippers Overseas Correspondence*. Later, as a consequence of increasing wartime controls, Mr Croner compiled all the information needed by exporters and importers into the “Reference Book for Shippers.” The next 20 years saw the publication of four more loose-leaves: *the Reference Book for Employers* (1955), *the World Directory of Freight Conferences*, *The Reference Book for Importers* and *Road Transport Operation*.

The modern history of Croner dates back to 1976 when Mrs. Croner appointed her nephew, Andrew Brode, as the new managing director. Brode set about expanding the marketing effort and raising the profile of the loose-leaf as an information delivery system. The increased profitability attracted the attention of UK and European publishers and in 1977 Brode negotiated the acquisition of Croner by a Dutch group ICU. In 1982, ICU subsequently changed its name to the Wolters Samson Group, and, in 1987, combined with Kluwer to form Wolters Kluwer.
