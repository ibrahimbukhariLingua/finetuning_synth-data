Indian 200-rupee note


# Indian 200-rupee note



The **Indian 200-rupee note** (₹200) is a denomination of the Indian rupee. After the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation, the new currency notes were announced by the Reserve Bank of India: ₹2,000, ₹500, ₹200, ₹100, ₹50, ₹20 and ₹10.

In order to determine currency denominations, the Reserve Bank of India follows a variation of the Renard series, called the 1-2-5 series, in which a ‘decade’ or a 1:10 ratio is covered in 3 steps, such as 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, etc. The Reserve Bank of India described the 200-rupee notes as the missing link in the Renard series. Besides the Indian Rupee, Euro and British Pound sterlings are two of the most notable currencies that are denominated in the 1-2-5 series. Renard series first proposed by French Army engineer Charles Renard. In March 2017, the decision to introduce ₹200 notes was taken by the Reserve Bank of India with the consultation of the Ministry of Finance. The currency is produced by printing units of the government-run Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India or at printing presses in Mysore and Salboni, managed by the Reserve Bank of India-owned Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited, reportedly by Times of India. The Government of India (GOI) had examined the introduction of the ₹200 notes that would help citizens transact easily.
In June 2017, a photograph of a ₹200 banknote went viral on social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp. RBI announced the specifications of the new 200-rupee note in the Mahatma Gandhi New Series, bearing the signature of Dr. Urjit R.
