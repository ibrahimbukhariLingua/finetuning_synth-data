Indian pie


# Indian pie



A **pie** (abbreviated as **Ps**) was a unit of currency in India, Burma and Pakistan until 1947. It was the smallest currency unit, equal to 1⁄3 of a pice, 1⁄12 of an anna or 1⁄192 of a rupee. During the mid-nineteenth century, one pie was worth 12 cowry.

Minting of the pie ended in 1942, though it remained in circulation for a further five years. The pie was demonetized in 1947 as it had become practically worthless due to inflation during WW2.
