A protégé of Ivan Boesky, Mulheren was implicated in the insider trading scandals of the late 1980s and was convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in 1990. Mulheren's involvement in the scandals and his relationship with Boesky are discussed with great detail in *Den of Thieves* by James B. Stewart. Upon learning that Boesky had implicated him in the scandal, Mulheren reportedly set out to kill Boesky. Mulheren's conviction was overturned by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1991.

Mulheren graduated from Roanoke College in 1971. He donated millions to the college naming several buildings after former professors and mentors. The entrance to the college is named "John's Bridge" in his honor. Mulheren's widow, Nancy, is a college trustee.

Mulheren suffered from bipolar disorder. He died of cardiac arrest that followed a seizure he suffered at his Bingham Drive home on December 15, 2003. Bruce Springsteen, a close friend, performed at the funeral.
