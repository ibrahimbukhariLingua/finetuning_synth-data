Automotive part retailer


# Automotive part retailer



An **automotive part retailer** is a retail business that sells automotive parts and related accessories to both consumers and professional repair shops, through physical stores and websites. Some automotive parts retailers also offer customer support and services related to automotive maintenance and repair.

The sector is often dependent on consumers' disposable income, and therefore affected by business cycles and economic conditions.


## History

The automotive parts industry in the United States began with the proliferation of automobiles as a common method of transportation. As the industry grew, small businesses came to be replaced by chains and retail networks. General Motors was the first company in the industry to begin franchising in 1893. In 1909, Western Auto became the first retailer of aftermarket automotive parts in the United States. In 1928, Genuine Parts Company as a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts and consumer supplies. Its largest component is NAPA Auto Parts.

By the 1970s, large companies like Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone and O'Reilly Auto Parts dominated the market. Most of these also offered private label automotive products, which accounted over 50% of revenue in some cases.

Demand for automotive parts correlates with the average age of vehicles on the road, and the price of fuel. When newer cars are more expensive or there are supply chain issues, consumers are more likely to keep and repair their existing cars, or purchase older used cars that require more regular repairs. The average age of vehicles in the United States increased from the 6.5 years in 1980, to 8.5 years in 2000.


### 2020 to present

Demand for auto parts can be affected by how much consumers travel for work, education and travel. During the COVID-19 pandemic, sales dropped rapidly, as did the stock price growth of many major US retailers during 2020. The subsequent increase in road travel had the opposite effect; unlike home improvement, furniture or grocery retailers, automotive parts retailers directly benefited from incremental increases in the number of consumers commuting to work or school.

Major American retailers recorded high revenue, sales figures or operating margins in 2021 as a result of this trend, despite experiencing high inflation and supply chain pressures.

The average age of a vehicle in the US reached a record high of 12.1 years in 2021. The price of gas rose sharply in 2022, causing volatility for the sector.
