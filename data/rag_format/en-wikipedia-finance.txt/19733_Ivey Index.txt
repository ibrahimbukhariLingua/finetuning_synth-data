Ivey Index


# Ivey Index



The **Ivey Purchasing Managers Index (IPMI)**, also known as the **Ivey PMI**, is an economic indicator in Canada that reflects month-to-month changes in the dollar value of purchases as reported by a panel of purchasing managers across various sectors. Jointly sponsored by the **Purchasing Management Association of Canada (PMAC)**—now integrated into the **Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA)**—and the **Richard Ivey School of Business** at Western University, Ontario, the index serves as a key measure of economic activity in Canada.


## Overview

The Ivey PMI is derived from survey responses from purchasing managers across multiple industries in Canada, capturing fluctuations in five main areas of activity: **purchases**, **employment**, **inventories**, **supplier deliveries**, and **prices**. Each month, the managers indicate whether activity in these categories has increased, decreased, or remained stable relative to the previous month.

The responses are compiled into an index where a reading above 50 points indicates an expansion in economic activity, and a reading below 50 suggests contraction. This format aligns the IPMI with other globally recognized PMIs, including the **ISM Manufacturing PMI** in the United States, making it an effective tool for anticipating economic trends.
