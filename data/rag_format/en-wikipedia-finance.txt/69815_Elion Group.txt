Elion Group


# Elion Group



**Elion Group** founded in 1988, is a Chinese company in afforestation and reclaiming desert and drylands, and is headquartered in the Kubuqi Desert.

The company has a "Green Land Plan", a land management program in Kubuqi Desert, where local farmers and herdsmen in the desert are the stated beneficiaries. The program has restored 6,000 km2 of the desert and turned it into sustainable "green lands", and consequently generated around 5.1 billion dollars of Gross Ecosystem Production (GEP). It also runs the funding programme, “Greening the Silk Road Partnership Programme”, that was jointly initiated with the UNEP and UNCCD, and its stated goals are to plant 1.3 billion trees within a decade.

Committed to preventing land degradation and transforming deserts into cities, it has partnered with both the locals and the Chinese government to combat desertification. According to *Time* magazine in 2017, the company has greened one third of Kubuqi Desert after almost 3 decades. Based on Elion's experiment, Kubuqi International Desert Forum, the only desert forum worldwide, was established in 2007.

The achievement of Elion Resources Group has been recognized by UNEP and UNCCD and is now broadening its business to other environmentally related areas. In March 2015, Elion became the first Chinese company that joined the program of RE 100 initiated by the Climate Group.

On March 9, 2015, the first private equity fund for Green Silk Road was launched in Beijing, which will be used in 'ecological solar panel construction, clean energy and ecological remediation in China and other countries'. The fund was contributed by several Chinese companies, including Elion Group.
