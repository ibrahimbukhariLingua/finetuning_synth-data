## History

The Jersey Co-operative Society was formed in 1919 and the Guernsey Co-operative Society followed in 1947. Both predecessors were supported by a CWS supervisory committee, which meant their accounts were liable to UK taxation. Growing objection to this persuaded the CWS to propose a merger which led to the incorporation of the Channel Islands' Society in 1955.

In August 2013, it was announced that the company's two Channel Island *Homemaker* warehouses would be closed, and replaced with a single warehouse in the UK.


## Activities

The society operates twelve grocery stores in Jersey and ten in Guernsey, the largest of which are called Grand Marche, the stores with a petrol forecourt trade as En Route and the convenience stores trading as Locale, all of which charge the same retail prices. In addition the society operates *Travelmaker*, funeral care, member services through its post office network, 'Pharmacy Locale and *Medical Care* businesses. Membership is open to all residents of the Channel Islands when they open a share account for £1, with members receiving a share of the profits in the form of dividends.

The Channel Islands' Co-operative Society is a UK-registered industrial and provident society, a member of the Co-operative Union in the United Kingdom, Federal Retail Trading Services, the Co-operative Travel Trading Group and a corporate member of The Co-operative Group (formerly Co-operative Wholesale Society), the largest consumer co-operative in the world.
