## History

IEC was originally founded in 1982 in Los Angeles, California, with the name United Electronics Institute. In 1998, IEC acquired Advanced Career Training (ACT), and ACT became United Education Institute (UEI) in January 2010. In 2009, the eight Southern California United Education Institute campuses became UEI College. As of April 2022, IEC operates 37 campuses nationwide in seven states.

In May 2022, IEC acquired the Sage Corporation, which operates Sage Truck Driving Schools. Sage operates 22 campuses in 12 states, including Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina, New York (state), Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

Nearly one year later, in April 2023, the U.S. Department of Education began to deny Florida Career College access to federal financial aid. The department alleged that the college "improperly allowed students without a high school diploma or equivalent credential to test into eligibility for federal aid." The following year, administrators announced that the college would close by February 15, 2024. The college remained open so that students could finish their programs.

In 2024, in a deal with the US Department of Education, IEC CEO Fardad Fateri and CFO Sanjay Sardana agreed to "never again be employed by an IEC-related entity that receives Title IV federal student aid."
