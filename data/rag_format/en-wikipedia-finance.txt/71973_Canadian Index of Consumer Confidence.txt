1. Considering everything, would you say that your family is better or worse off financially than six months ago?
2. Again, considering everything, do you think that your family will be better off, the same or worse off financially six months from now?
3. How do you feel the job situation and overall employment will be in this community six months from now?
4. Do you think that right now is a good or bad time for the average person to make a major outlay for items such as a home, car or other major item?
