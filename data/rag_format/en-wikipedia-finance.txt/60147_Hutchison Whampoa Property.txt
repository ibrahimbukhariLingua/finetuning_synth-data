Hutchison Whampoa Property


# Hutchison Whampoa Property



**Hutchison Whampoa Property Group** was the property development and investment arm of Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong.

In 2015, the company was spun-out of Cheung Kong Holdings to form part of Cheung Kong Property Holdings. Hutchison Whampoa Properties Limited has since been renamed **Hutchison Property Group Limited (和記地產集團有限公司)**.


## History

The company was formerly **Hutchison Properties Limited** (**HPL**). HPL was incorporated in 1971, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Hutchison International Limited (HIL). Shortly afterwards, it became a listed company and acquired the major property interests of HIL and its trading subsidiaries.

In 1980, HPL was privatized by Hutchison Whampoa Limited (HWL), making it once again a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1993, HWL formed **Hutchison Whampoa Properties Limited** to hold all the property interests of HWD, HPL and HWL's newly privatised subsidiary, CIHL.
