## FTC Warns of Possible Privacy Violations

On May 7, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission issued a release stating that a test-shopping sting operation through the FTC's Worldwide Privacy Protection Effort indicated that 10 companies, Exact Data ConsumerBase included, were willing to sell consumer information without abiding by the Fair Credit Reporting Act's (FCRA) requirements.

Specifically, it was said that Exact Data ConsumerBase appeared to offer "pre-screened" lists of consumers for use in making firm credit card offers.

The incident aimed to increase awareness and expose data brokerage policies, not necessarily intending to accuse the companies of breaking laws.
According to *The Washington Post*, “This should help raise awareness,” said Laura Berger, an attorney with the Bureau of Consumer Protection. She declined to comment on whether these or other companies are facing full investigations by the FTC.

No actual data purchases were made, but an informal warning letter was sent to the company, as there was no hard evidence of wrongdoing.
