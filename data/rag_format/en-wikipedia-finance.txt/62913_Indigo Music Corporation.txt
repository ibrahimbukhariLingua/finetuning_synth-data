Some years later they recorded an album in Nashville with Nelson Larkin as the producer and Ron “Snake” Reynolds as the producer. The album wasn't released due to the studio and label Sunbird Records going out of business. And the tape was unrecoverable.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ For about three or four years they didn't hear about the album or its outcome until they were alerted by a friend.
