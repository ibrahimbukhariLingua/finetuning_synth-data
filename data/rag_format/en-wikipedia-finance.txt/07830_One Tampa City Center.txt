On October 30, 2014, the building was sold for $128 million to Alliance Partners HSP. Alliance Partners subsequently split the ownership of the land and the building, selling the building in October 2018 for $110 million to Banyan Street Capital and Oaktree Capital Management. HSBC provided an $84 million acquisition loan for the purchase.
