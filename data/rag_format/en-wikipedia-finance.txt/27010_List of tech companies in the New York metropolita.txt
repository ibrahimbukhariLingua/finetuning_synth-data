# List of tech companies in the New York metropolitan area



**Technology companies in the New York City metropolitan area** represent a significant and growing economic component of the New York metropolitan area, the most populous combined statistical area in the United States and one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. New York is a top-tier global high technology hub. Silicon Alley, once a metonym for the sphere encompassing the metropolitan region's high technology industries, is no longer a relevant moniker as the city's tech environment has expanded dramatically both in location and in its scope. New tech establishments include those of Israeli companies in New York City, at a rate of ten new startups per month, and the technology sector has been claiming a greater share of New York City's economy since 2010. Tech:NYC, founded in 2016, is a nonprofit organization which represents New York City's technology industry with government, civic institutions, in business, and in the media and whose primary goals are to attract tech talent to the city and to advocate for policies that will help tech companies grow.
