Source selection criteria


# Source selection criteria



**Source selection criteria** describes properties that are crucial for a purchaser when deciding on a supplier. Criteria can be subjective or objective. Individual judgment can be biased, which may require balancing with objective measures. One approach is to identify a list of criteria such as cost and financial stability, assign a weight to each one and to score each vendor on each criterion. Then multiply the score by the weight and sum to get a final score. .


## Criteria

Criteria can be specific to the desired item(s). Sample criteria:

* Total costs (including works and maintenance)
* Ability to finance
* Capability for technical matters
* The distribution of risks
* The shape of business
* Previous works and references
* Providing Warranty
