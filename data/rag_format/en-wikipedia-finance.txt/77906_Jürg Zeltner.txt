Following the merger of SBC with the Union Bank of Switzerland (SBG/UBS) to become UBS in 1998, Zeltner was appointed as head of Portfolio Management for Risk Transformation and Capital Management.

From 2005 to 2007 he occupied the position of CEO at UBS Deutschland, Frankfurt. In November 2007, he was appointed as Head of Wealth Management North, East & Central Europe. From February 2009 to January 2012 he was co-CEO of Wealth Management and Swiss Bank.

He was the President of UBS Wealth Management from November 2014 to December 2017 with more than 2 Trillion Assets under Management globally.

On 4 December 2017, UBS announced Zeltner would step down from GEB at the end of the year. He retired from the firm in 2018. The Board of Directors then appointed Martin Blessing, a former President of Human Resources and Corporate Banking, and President of UBS Switzerland, to succeed him as President of Wealth Management.

In 2019, Zeltner was appointed Group CEO and member of the Board of Directors at KBL European Private Bankers. He made a significant co-investment in the pan-European private banking group.

### Business strategy

On 17 November 2011, UBS held their annual Investor Day in New York. Zeltner gave a presentation on the UBS Wealth Management Division, in which he outlined how the business was positioned in the financial markets and in view of future growth. He pointed out that UBS's strategy is centered around its wealth management business.

In February 2015, Zeltner was awarded second place among the ten best global private banking CEOs of 2015. He revealed the strategies behind the Wealth Management division. According to him, there was a shift from asset gathering and product manufacturing to clients advisory, and, with the markets moving so rapidly, portfolio diversification. According to Zeltner, the focus of wealth management had to be advising clients on how to position their portfolio, and on carrying research on asset allocation and on investment management. With regard to the move of the Swiss National Bank to unpeg the Swiss franc from the euro, he affirmed "the sharp fall in the Swiss equity markets and the currency turmoil highlight the importance of portfolio diversification. Anyone who follows this principle and holds securities in all the world's major markets, hedging their currency risks, is financially better equipped to cope with this decision, giving UBS the opportunity to demonstrate to clients why they need us." In 2016, Zellner's work to improve private banking was appreciated even by his competition.
