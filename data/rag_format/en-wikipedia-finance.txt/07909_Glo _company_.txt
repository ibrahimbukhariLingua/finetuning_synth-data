### Glo Mobile

Glo Mobile, a subsidiary of Globacom, is Nigeria's second largest Mobile Network Operator. In the first year of operation, it had one million subscribers in over 87 towns in Nigeria and over 120 billion Naira in revenues. Glo Mobile has now spread to other African countries, namely Benin and Ghana. Glo later sold its Ghana subsidiary to Airtel when it exited the mobile communication space of Ghana to focus on enterprise telecom services. Glo Mobile's subscriber base in Nigeria stood at over 45 million by December 2018.

By November 2020, the subscription level had hit 54 million, but by September 2024, the subscription level had dropped to 19.1 million.


### Glo 1 submarine cable

GLO-1 is the first successful submarine cable from the United Kingdom to Nigeria, and GLO is the first individual African company to embark on such a project.

GLO-1 has the potential to provide high speed internet services, faster, more reliable and cheaper telecom services. Glo-1 will potentially facilitate foreign investment and employment opportunities especially to Africans.

The 9,800 km long cable originates from Bude in the UK and is laid from this origin to Alpha Beach in Lagos, where it will have its landing station.
