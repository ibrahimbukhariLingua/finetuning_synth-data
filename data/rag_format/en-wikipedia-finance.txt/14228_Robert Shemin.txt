## Investing career

Shemin graduated from the joint law and MBA degree program at Emory University. After law school he worked at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica, and in the investment industry, he worked for Goldman Sachs & Co. in securities sales. Shemin purchased his first property at the age of twenty-nine. Within six years, in 1996, he owned 120 rental properties in the Nashville area. In 1998, twenty-six of Shemin's properties were damaged by tornados. While the insurance company initially refused to pay for the damage, Shemin was able to successfully appeal the legal basis of their refusal and receive payment.


## Books

Shemin's first two books were "Honest Profits: Your Hands-on Guide to Successful Real Estate Investing" and "The Renters Rights Handbook". He then continued to write "Successful Real Estate Investing". Following its publication Shemin provided on-air answers to the questions of call-in viewers for television networks such as CNN and Fox News. He has since spoken before audiences in several countries.

He is also the author of "How Come That Idiot's Rich and I'm Not", which was a New York Times best-seller. The Boston Globe reviewed the book, stating that, "Shemin lays out a plan of eight money-making secrets, all the while stressing that money doesn't matter as much as love and happiness. Wealth is a state of mind, he insists, and his suggestions for achieving it, while mostly common sense, are doable and helpful â€¦ What's best about this book is the charismatic Shemin's wit and support, making feeling good about yourself a priceless benefit."

"Secrets of a Millionaire Real Estate Investor" was also a best-seller for Shemin. Other books by Shemin include "Secrets Of A Millionaire Landlord" and "40 Days to Success in Real Estate Investing". He has spoken in support of his books to live audiences, and has been interviewed about real estate for about three hundred different articles.
