Ghana Club 100


# Ghana Club 100



The **Ghana Club 100** is a yearly official list of the top 100 companies in Ghana. The compilation was first done in 1998 by the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC) with the aim of recognition of the top 100 companies and to encourage competition and improvement of company products and services in the country. It is based on the responses of a survey conducted annually by the GIPC, which companies can voluntarily participate in by submitting various information, including their financial statements. Due to the voluntary nature of the survey, in some years the number of companies listed has been fewer than 100. Most of the companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange are included in Ghana Club 100.

The Ghana Club 100 (or GC100) is about corporate excellence. Companies making it into the GC100 are to serve as role models for the private sector and provide a forum for corporate Ghana to interact with the government at a high level.


## Objectives


### GC100 objectives

* Develop an open information culture within the Ghanaian corporate sector
* Provide incentives for improved performance
* Develop uniform criteria for evaluating this performance
* To establish an annual database of the top 100 performing companies.

## Eligibility Criteria

* All entrants must be limited liability companies
* For companies with Government interest, Government ownership should be less than 50% unless the company is listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange

## Ranking Methodology

According to GIPC, the following process is used to determine a company’s overall rank in the Ghana Club 100 list, (GC100);

* A weighted rank is calculated by applying the weights to a company’s rank on each of the following parameters:

1. Size
2. Profitability
3. Growth

* An overall rank of a company in the GC100 is then obtained from a company’s weighted average rank.
* A company’s growth is used as a tie-breaker to eliminate all ties in the ranking.
