While a number of crowdfunding platforms began to appear online from 2006 onwards, these were associated with creative projects and rewards or donation-based crowdfunding. Few countries had introduced formal equity crowdfunding legislation at this time. Symbid was founded in April 2011 as one of the first equity crowdfunding platforms worldwide.

Also in April 2016 it was reported that Symbid made their development team redundant. More losses of $2,005,751 in the first half year of 2016 "raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern".
