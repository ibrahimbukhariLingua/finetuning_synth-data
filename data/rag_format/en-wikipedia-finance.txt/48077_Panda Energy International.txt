The company built the two largest gas-fueled merchant electric generation facilities in the United States totaling 4,400 megawatts of generating capacity; was responsible for the first U.S sponsored, internationally financed run-of-the-river hydroelectric project in the Himalayan nation of Nepal; and obtained the first U.S. capital markets financing for construction of a power plant in the People’s Republic of China. Altogether, the company has raised over U.S. $4.9 billion to develop and build more than 9,000 megawatts of generating capacity. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Panda Energy designs, builds and in some cases administers power plants, with a focus on renewable energy sources such as agricultural products, ethanol, clean coal, biofuel and hydro.

### Closure

In 2017, Panda's power plant in Temple, Texas declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

On September 6, 2018, Panda chairman Janice Carter sent what she referred to as "this final shareholder letter." The letter states, "Independent power companies can no longer compete in today's power market against government subsidized renewables, such as wind. Panda Energy International, Inc. will officially shut down its operations by the end of the year. Over the past 36 years we have returned approximately 20X money to our initial investors. Panda's current assets have an appraised value of approximately $7.8 Million which it will endeavor to sell to the highest bidder. If a sale is successful, these funds will then be distributed as a dividend to its shareholders." She closes by thanking all shareholders for their support over the years. In 2022, Panda's power plant converted its Chapter 11 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.


### TNA Entertainment, LLC.

In October 2002, Panda Energy purchased a controlling interest (72%) of the Nashville, Tennessee-based professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from founder and CEO Jerry Jarrett.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The seemingly unlikely acquisition came about after TNA publicist Dixie Carter, the daughter of Robert W. Carter, contacted her father and persuaded him to purchase the company (which was facing bankruptcy after a major financial backer, HealthSouth Corporation, withdrew their support).

On October 31, 2002, Panda Energy created the limited liability company TNA Entertainment in order to administer TNA. While Jeff Jarrett, the former president of TNA, was appointed vice president, the majority of other management positions were filled by former Panda executives. Chris Sobol, the Panda manager of business development, was appointed vice president of operations, and Frank Dickerson (and later Kevin Day) was appointed chief executive officer, while Dixie Carter was made president.

On September 16, 2015, it was reported that Jarrett's minority ownership has been bought out, meaning that he is, as of now, 100% divested of the promotion and Panda Energy has full control of it.

As of April 18, 2016, it has been reported that, upon Jarrett selling his stake in TNA, Panda Energy completely divested themselves of TNA, resulting in Panda Energy founder Robert Carter and president and chief executive officer Janice Carter's daughter, Dixie, acquiring both Jarrett & Panda Energy's ownership interests, resulting in her becoming owner, as well as continuing as president.
