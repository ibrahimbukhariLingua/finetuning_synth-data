Reserve Bank of Fiji


# Reserve Bank of Fiji



The **Reserve Bank of Fiji** (**RBF**; Fijian: *Maroroi Baqe ni Viti*) is the central bank of the Pacific island country of Fiji. Its responsibilities include the issue of currency, control of the money supply, currency exchange, monetary stability, promotion of sound finances, and fostering economic development.

The Bank is the only institution that is permitted to issue Fijian dollars (FJD) and put them into circulation. It is also responsible for setting the overnight policy rate, the main policy or bank rate for Fiji.


## Background

In 1914, the colonial government established the Currency Board with the sole right to issue Fijian pound notes and coins in the then Colony of Fiji. Following independence from Britain in 1970, the Central Monetary Authority (CMA) was created in 1973 and took over the issuing of currency and further expanded responsibilities.

The CMA was tasked with regulating the issue, supply, availability and international exchange of the Fijian dollar (FJD); with promoting monetary stability and a sound financial structure; and fostering credit and exchange conditions for the economic development of Fiji. It also acted as a banker to the government. By the 1980s, the government of Fiji wanted to expand its role and the Bank of Fiji was created by the *Reserve Bank of Fiji Act* of 1983, replacing the CMA.


## Statutory responsibilities

The functions, powers, and responsibilities of the Bank were specified in the *Reserve Bank of Fiji Act*, 1983. The principal purposes of the Bank as stated in Part 2, Section 4, of the Reserve Bank Act were as follows:

* to regulate the issue of currency, and the supply, availability, and international exchange of money;
* to promote monetary stability;
* to promote a sound financial structure;
* to foster credit and exchange conditions conducive to the orderly and balanced economic development of the country.

In 2009, following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, amendments expanded the bank's responsibilities to include the regulation of the insurance industry, securities industry, and capital markets.


## Departments

The Bank has four main departments: economics, financial markets, financial institutions, and currency and corporate services. The key roles of each department are as follows:
