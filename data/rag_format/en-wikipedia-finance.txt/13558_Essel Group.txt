Essel Group


# Essel Group



**Essel Group** (also known as **Zee Group**) is an Indian media conglomerate, headquartered in Mumbai, India. The group has had business interests in mass media, infrastructure and packaging. Founded in 1926 as the Messrs Ramgopal Indraprasad by Jagannath Goenka, the company was expanded and converted into the Essel Group of Industries by his grandson, Subhash Chandra.
Chandra is part of the Goenka (Goel) family which owns and operates the group; he was also the chairman of the company and a former member of the Rajya Sabha.

Experiencing financial troubles in 2019, Essel sold off several of its assets, including Essel Propack and stakes in Zee Entertainment Enterprises.


## History


### 1926–1967

In 1926, Jagannath Goenka founded the Messrs Ramgopal Indraprasad as a commercial firm to deal in food grains at the *mandi* (product market) in Adampur, Hisar. In 1946, as a result of poor performance in Adampur, the firm moved to the town of Hisar. Goenka attempted to expand the business in 1948 by setting up a pulses polishing factory in Delhi, but he suffered heavy losses, forcing him to cease Delhi operations in 1951. He moved the Delhi machinery to Hisar, where he was able to turn consistent profits by selling polished whole grains to Gujarat and South India. By 1966, the firm was operating one dal mill and two cotton ginning factories.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### 1967–1992

In 1967, the business suffered a series of losses, leaving the Goenka family at a net deficit of ₹600,000 (equivalent to ₹32 million or US$370,000 in 2023). Between 1967–68, the Goenkas' connections in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) helped the family secure not only a deal to supply it with polished pulses and cleaned barley but also a later contract for storage of food grains.

In 1973, control of the company was handed over to Subhash Chandra, the grandson of Jagannath Goenka.

The company renamed itself the Essel Group in 1976. After acquiring a storage contract with the FCI in the same year, Essel established a new subsidiary, Lamina Packers, to manufacture packaging materials. In 1981, Essel obtained lucrative export contracts for rice and soya beans as a result of Indo–USSR bilateral trade agreements. According to a 2014 estimate, Essel Group's net worth by 1982 was over ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹160 crore or US$18 million in 2023).

In December 1982, Lamina Packers became incorporated as Essel Packaging, which marked Essel Group's full-blown venture into the packaging industry, with the primary product being the laminated tube units that originated with Lamina Packers. In 1983, the group also began investing in a future amusement park in Mumbai. EsselWorld opened six years later, becoming India's first amusement park. Although the park was partly meant to signal that its parent corporation wanted to be a major force in the entertainment industry, EsselWorld had always been unprofitable until its shutdown in 2023.


### 1992–Present

As of 1992, Essel Group began to take a bigger interest and stake in the entertainment industry. That year it incorporated Zee Telefilms Ltd and then looked for a place where Zee's content could be broadcast. Zee and Star TV entered into a joint venture called Asia Today Ltd so Zee could lease a transponder from satellite network AsiaSat. The transponder agreement was signed in April 1992, and Zee TV began broadcasting on 1 October. It was India's first Hindi Language satellite channel, and by 1994 it had captured 65% of the satellite market share. Zee TV remained the market leader until 2000.

In 1994, Essel Group incorporated Siti Cable to be the distribution subsidiary of Zee Telefilms. Siti would provide cable service to customers to expand the reach of Zee's satellite channels.

The company continued to develop entertainment channels that successfully competed with Star India, a Star TV subsidiary. In 1998, Essel/Zee turned to journalism with Zee News, the first 24x7 Hindi Language news channel in India.

In 2000, Zee Telefilms ended its partnership with Star TV by buying out its shares in Asia Today Ltd. Star India was now free to produce programmes in Hindi in an attempt to target local audiences and lure Zee's viewers away.

Star India would not be Zee's only competition in the coming years. Both international and regional broadcasters ate away at Zee's market share, some substantially. Zee News saw its market dominance broken with the emergence of competing channels such as Aaj Tak, STAR News, and NDTV (after its own separation from STAR News). Trying to get a competitive edge, Zee Telefilms entered into a joint venture with Turner Broadcasting System in 2002 so Zee's subscription packages could include Turner subscription channels such as Cartoon Network, Pogo, and HBO alongside Zee Telefilm channels. Essel also had high hopes for another market and more viewers when, through its subsidiary Dish TV, it launched the first direct-to-home television in India on 2 October 2003.

In 2006, Essel separated Zee Telefilms Ltd into three companies: Zee News Ltd, the group's news broadcasting subsidiary; Wire & Wireless India Ltd (later renamed to Siti Networks), the cable distribution subsidiary; and Zee Telefilms Ltd, which remained the group's direct consumer broadcasting arm. (Just a year later, Zee Telefilms Ltd was renamed Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, and in 2013 Zee News Ltd became Zee Media Corporation Ltd.)

Zee Telefilms was trying at this time to enter Indian sports broadcasting, but acquiring cricket broadcasting rights proved very difficult. In 2004, Zee briefly secured rights from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but the contract was canceled following a legal complaint over the conduct of the rights auction. In 2005, Zee went forward with launching the Zee Sports channel, and in the following year it bought Taj Television, which operated the Ten Sports channels.

After years of failing to get cricket broadcasting rights, in 2007 the Zee firms funded their own Indian Cricket League (ICL) and televised its games, but it never gained traction and was phased out after two seasons. Under its own name, Essel Group launched the Mumbai Football Club that year, which, though it outlasted Essel's investment in sport broadcasting, was defunct by 2019.

In 2016, Zee decided to cut its losses and sold all its sport broadcasting assets to Sony. The joint distribution venture with Turner India ended in 2018.

By 2019, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) was Essel Group's only profit-generating company; the group had accumulated an overall debt of around ₹20,000 crore (equivalent to ₹250 billion or US$2.9 billion in 2023). During the next year, Essel Group sold off part of its pledged shares in ZEEL for the repayment of some of its debt. Invesco Oppenheimer acquired an 11% stake in the company, while Essel Group's decreased to 22.37%.

## Controversy


### Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (Dispute between Promoters)

On 11 September 2021, Invesco asked Zee management to call an "extraordinary general meeting" (EGM) of shareholders to consider its demands. One of the main demands was the removal of Punit Goenka, son of the Zee Network founder. However the Zee board rejected the demand from Invesco to convene an extraordinary general meeting. Invesco Developing Market Funds Moves to a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the Bombay High Court, seeking a mandatory order for Zee Enterprises Entertainment Limited (ZEEL) to call the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) that the shareholder has been demanding.

OFI Global China Fund, who also moved the NCLT along with Invesco, remarked at the hearing that the meeting that Zee Entertainment board had conducted on October 1 was just a legal formality and that it is a classic case of Forum shopping.

They had also tried to merge Zee with some other Indian company in early 2021, but the Zee board rejected it.

The Zee Board replied to Invesco's open letter saying they didn't care about the company, and Invesco is not motivated by concerns related to any corporate governance issue, but "by the events that transpired during February-April 2021 pointing Invesco purposed deal with Reliance Industries.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said it proposed to merge all its media properties with Zee Entertainment at fair valuations during discussions in February and March 2021 that US investment firm Invesco helped arrange with managing director and member of the founding family of the media and entertainment company.
