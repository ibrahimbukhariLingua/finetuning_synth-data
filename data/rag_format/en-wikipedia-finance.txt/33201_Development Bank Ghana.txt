## History

The DBG was conceived in 2017 , established in 2020, awarded license to operate by Bank of Ghana in 2021 and launched in June 2022. It was established to complement two other government-owned financial houses established before, namely the Agricultural Development Bank of Ghana and the National Investment Bank. However, they lacked long-term lending at reasonable rates to small businesses, "in the agriculture value chain, manufacturing, and high-value services".


## Mandate

The mandate of DBG is to provide long-term financing and de-risking services underpinned by technology and evidence-based research insights. However, the core mandate of DBG is to provide and alleviate financing constraints faced by micro, medium, and small enterprises(MMSE) and small corporates in business, manufacturing, and high-value services through the provision of wholesale financing and partial credit guarantees to eligible financing.


## Future plans

The bank plans to increase its coffers by injecting more capital from the government of Ghana and its development partners. It is the objective of DBG to increase the proportion of banking loans advanced to small businesses from 9 percent in 2022 to 15 percent in 2024.
