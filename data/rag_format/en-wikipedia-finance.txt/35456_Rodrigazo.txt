Rodrigazo


# Rodrigazo



**Rodrigazo** is the name given to a group of economic policies announced in Argentina on June 4, 1975 and the riots that ensued thereafter. The name is from the fact that the policies were announced and implemented by Celestino Rodrigo, the Minister of Economy of Argentina appointed by President Isabel Perón in May 1975. The Rodrigazo fractured the prime bulwark of Peronist support, labor unions, and is held to have helped lead to Isabel Perón's downfall less than a year later.


## Summary

* A 150% devaluation of currency for the commercial exchange rate.
* A 100% increase in utility and transportation prices.
* A 180% rise in the price of fuel.
* A 45% increase in wages.

## Aftermath

Afterward, the real wage (the purchasing power of the wage) fell, as prices overall doubled between May and August alone and continued to fall until well into 1979. The crisis had political consequences, but not all were negative. Blindsided by the draconian measure, the normally supportive CGT (the largest labor union in Latin America, at the time), called a general strike – the first ever under a Peronist government. Demanding a 125-150% mandatory wage hike, the CGT initially obtained Mrs. Perón's commitment to its enactment. As they gathered at Plaza de Mayo on June 27 in gratitude for her concession, however, the president abruptly reneged on her commitment. This sent the demonstrators into a riot directed at Rodrigo's benefactor José López Rega, the powerful Social Welfare Minister, leader of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, and Perón family confidant. The president had the Triple A death squad leader Rega flee Argentina by appointing him Ambassador to Spain on July 11. She then removed Rodrigo, the Armed Forces Commander, General Alberto Numa Laplane, and numerous other López Rega protégés.

According to economist Guillermo Calvo, the economic turmoil that followed the *Rodrigazo*, including an inflation rate of around 35% a month, was one of the main reasons for the March 1976 coup that removed the Peronist government.
