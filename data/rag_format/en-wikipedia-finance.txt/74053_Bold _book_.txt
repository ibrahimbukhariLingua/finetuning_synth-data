2. The psychological aspects of the bold. Here, Diamandis discusses what he learned from building his 15 companies.
3. Best practices, such as incentive competitions, crowd funding campaigns, and community building.

## Reception

*The Washington Post* wrote that it "looks only on the bright side" and "overlooks some of the risks in exponential technologies, particularly the legal and ethical dilemmas they are creating." *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that the "authors prefer to rhapsodize rather than analyze the consequences of technological advance" and that it shows how the Silicon Valley people are "profoundly different" from the "rest of us".
