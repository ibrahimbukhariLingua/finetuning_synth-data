Gerstein received his BSc. in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

On February 23, 2011, Irving Gerstein was charged, along with Senator Doug Finley, with violations of the Canada Elections Act. Elections Canada alleged that Irving Gerstein was complicit in a scheme that involved filing false tax claims and exceeding federal spending limits on campaign advertisements. If found guilty, Gerstein would have faced up to a year in prison and fines exceeding $25,000; however, the charges were dropped after the Conservative party agreed to pay a $52,000 fine.

Gerstein was the chair of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce which authored the 2013 report entitled *Follow the Money: Is Canada Making Progress in Combatting the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing? Not Really.* The report cautioned that in spite of considerable resources expended, "there is a lack of clear and compelling evidence that Canada’s regime is leading to the detection and deterrence of money laundering." The Senate also expressed concern that "Given that multinational financial institutions have recently been implicated in money laundering and terrorist financing, the Committee is concerned about non-compliance with the Act by reporting entities." The annual value of money laundering in Canada in 2011 was between $5 billion and $15 billion. Globally the annual value of global money laundering is between US$800 billion and US$2 trillion.

In June 2015 the same committee released a Senate report urging only light regulation of the digital currency Bitcoin.
