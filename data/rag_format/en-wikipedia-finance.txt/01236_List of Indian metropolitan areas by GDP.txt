Here Metropolitan area is based on adjoining administrative units(i.e, districts) of Urban Agglomeration not based on notified metropolitan area by government.

Statistical offices often rely on city definitions that reflect the borders between areas that are run by different local administrations, such as municipalities or counties. However, economic interactions typically don’t mind crossing administrative boundaries. Therefore, Here boundaries reflect economic, not administrative realities.

To make sure that what we call a city is comparable across countries in the world, we chose city boundaries that were originally determined by the Joint Research Center of the European Union. These boundaries are based on satellite images and an estimated population grid. They follow the inhabited and built environment of a city. That is, they aim to put borders where the buildings and population of a city stop.

GDP of most metropolitan areas are sourced from data published by state government as of 2022-23. For metropolitan areas for which latest data is unavailable, GDP is projected to 2022-23 using data from ICRISAT
