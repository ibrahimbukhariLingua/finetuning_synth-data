## History

DePaul's College of Commerce began offering business classes in January 1913, becoming one of the 10 oldest business schools in the nation and the first at a U.S. Roman Catholic university. The college established a Master of Business Administration program in 1948 and launched the Graduate School of Business. The college, including the Graduate School of Business, moved to its current Chicago location in the DePaul Center, 1 E. Jackson Blvd., in 1993.

In 1971, Commerce established its first center, the Small Business Institute. In 1977, Commerce began offering graduate classes at the university's suburban sites. Commerce established the Center for Market Analysis and Planning through a $1 million gift from the Charles H. Kellstadt Trust in 1982. In 1983, DePaul was awarded a $1 million gift from the Dr. Scholl Foundation to establish an endowed chair in its College of Commerce and Department of Finance. The Center for Business Ethics was launched in 1984. In 1986, Commerce received another $1 million grant from the Kellstadt Foundation to establish the Kellstadt Center for Marketing Analysis and Planning in Administration Center.

In 1988, the five-year Arthur Andersen & Co. Alumni Distinguished Professorship in accountancy and the Touche Ross Distinguished Professorship in accountancy were established.

In 1992, DePaul received a $9 million gift from the Kellstadt Foundation to establish the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business, named for Charles H. Kellstadt, former president, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears, Roebuck and Co.

In 1997, Kellstadt launched its first overseas part-time MBA program in Hong Kong, that program terminated in 2005. In 2000, Kellstadt added a part-time MBA program in Bahrain. In 2002, it added another in the Czech Republic through a partnership with the Czech Management Center, and that program terminated in 2009. The program's most recent overseas program was created in Taiwan in 2006 and terminated in 2010.

In 2002, Kellstadt created the Real Estate Center, under the direction of Professor Susanne E. Cannon. In 2006, the center received three gifts in excess of $1 million: $4 million from the Michael J. Horne Foundation to endow the Horne Chair in Real Estate Studies; $2 million from Douglas and Cynthia Crocker to endow the Doug and Cynthia Crocker Director of the Real Estate Center; and $1.5 million from George Ruff to endow the Ruff Chair in Real Estate Studies. In 2007, the MacArthur Foundation awarded the center a grant of $3.5 million to launch a multi-faceted program to save affordable rental housing in the Chicago region.

In 2008, Dean Ray Whittington created the Department of Real Estate, carving it out of the Department of Finance. Professor Susanne E. Cannon was chosen as the first department's first chairperson.

In fall 2008, the college received a $7.5 million gift from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation to establish the School of Hospitality Leadership, launched in fall 2009.

In 2012, DePaul alumnus Richard H. Driehaus gave DePaul a $30 million gift to be used to recruit and retain business faculty. DePaul renamed the College of Commerce the Driehaus College of Business. Part of the Driehaus College of Business, the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business retained its name.
