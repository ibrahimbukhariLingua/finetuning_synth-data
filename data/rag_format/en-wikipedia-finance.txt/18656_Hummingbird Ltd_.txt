## History

Hummingbird was one of many vendors of X server and Unix connectivity solutions for Windows-based computers, with its eXceed product being regarded as "an excellent all-round product" in the form of eXceed/W at version 3.3.3 in one 1994 review. The product provided an X server alongside other traditional TCP/IP-based applications such as FTP and telnet clients, supporting the wide range of TCP/IP stacks available for Windows at that time, requiring a minimum system specification of Windows 3.0 running on an Intel 80286-based PC with 2 MB of RAM. Version 4.0 of eXceed became available in 1994, and was released for Windows NT in 1995. A survey of the PC X server market by International Data Corporation for 1993 portrayed Hummingbird as the market leader with a reported 32% market share.

Acquisition of PCDOCS was one of the most important steps of the company in the way of formation as an ECM-oriented companyᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ. DOCS Open product of PCDOCS Inc. became Hummingbird DOCSFusion and DM - a part of Hummingbird document management system (a part of Hummingbird Enterprise Suite). The product still exists in OpenText products after rebranding with new name as eDOCS DM. In November 2012 OpenText launched the new v5.3.1 version with full support of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
