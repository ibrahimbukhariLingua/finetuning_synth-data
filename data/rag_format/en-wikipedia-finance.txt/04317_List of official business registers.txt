This is a **list of official business registers** around the world.

There are many types of official business registers, usually maintained for various purposes by a state authority, such as a government agency, or a court of law. In some cases, it may also be devolved to self-governing bodies, either commercial (a chamber of commerce) or professional (a regulatory college); or to a dedicated, highly regulated company (i.e., operator of a stock exchange, a multilateral trading facility, a central securities depository or an alternative trading system).

The following is an incomplete list of official business registers by country.


## Types of registers

A business register may include data on entities, as well as on their status for various purposes. Examples of such registers include:

* **company register** — a register of legal entities in the jurisdiction they operate under, for the purpose of establishing, dissolving, acquisition of legal capacity and (in some cases) juridical personality, determination of legal representation, protection, accountability, and control of legal entities.
* **list of undertakings cleared for access to classified information** — register of companies authorized to work on contracts involving dealing with sensitive information documents of a government or an international organisation, usually maintained by a counter-intelligence service.
* **statistical business register** — plays a central part in a system of official economic statistics at a national statistics office.

Another group of business registers is focused on various assets or liabilities of an entity, rather than on entities themselves, these include:

* **public contract register** — a repository that aims at keeping track of all procurements, usually awarded through a tender, concluded by the public institutions, making this information available online, thereby providing a basis for monitoring the way in which public money is spent.
* **public aid register** — an official register of businesses in difficulties which received aid from the state.
* **ultimate beneficial owner register** — an official repository of natural person or persons who ultimately own or control a company, maintained to counteract money laundering and terrorist financing.
* **land and mortgage register** — concerns titles, rights, and liabilities (such as real estate liens or pledges) related to real estate, consisting of premises specified in a cadaster, such as land, buildings, or condominium units,
* **cadaster** — determines the geospatial localization, the extent, and (in some cases) the value of premises, including land parcels, buildings, and condominium units, which together form real estate, subject to rights and liabilities registered in a land and mortgage register,
* **vehicle register** (such as those for motor vehicles, rolling stock, boat or ships, or aircraft) — includes entries containing data on vehicle identification number, vehicle registration plate number, vehicle title, type approval, vehicle inspections, liability insurance, as well as vehicle liens, such as maritime liens, and which sometimes may be connected to a register of pledges or tax liens.
* **register of pledges** — includes entries concerning liabilities (pledges and voluntary specific liens) of a pledgor to a creditor, secured by tying them to a pledgor's collateral, such as a movable, a security, or an intellectual property right.
* **industrial property register** — an official database containing registered trade marks, as well as patented inventions, industrial designs, utility models, or integrated circuits, thus protecting and reserving the rights of the company which developed them or bought rights to them.
* **plant breeders’ rights register** — registers rights to a protected plant variety, developed and registered by a plant breeder.

Some types of business registers combine the features of both groups, these include:

* **tax register** — a register used for the purpose of revenue collection, including taxes, duties such as tariffs or excise, as well as mandatory social insurance and health insurance contributions; such a register includes all taxable entities, as well as their tax liabilities, including tax liens.
* **public company and securities register** — the official repository of publicly listed or unlisted companies whose at least one emission of securities was offered for the purpose of free trading to a number of persons exceeding certain threshold (varying according to jurisdiction), thus placing such a company under specific regulatory obligations, mainly concerning mandatory publication of information on the terms and rights attached to the offered security, as well as information on the company itself and its finances.
* **list of companies and their securities publicly traded on a stock market** — maintained by a stock exchange or an alternative trading system for the purpose of trading and quoting companies’ stocks.
* **insolvency register** — contains information on companies who entered insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, administration, receivership, debt restructuring, or have been under futile execution, either of an administrative debt (by a government agency) or of a private debt (by a bailiff), for longer than an amount of time specified by law, as well as on their liabilities.
* **register or a list of a specified type of regulated entities or activities** — contains entries on companies officially authorized to perform a specified type of business, where prior obtaining of a permit, a license, a concession, or registration on such a list or register is a prerequisite required by law. Depending on situation, regulation may apply to an entity type, or to a type of entity's activity.

#### Regular company registers

There are two registers of entities which are obligated or allowed to register as entrepreneurs:

* Ministry of Development (MR) – **Central Registration and Information on Business** (**CEIDG**) – company register for natural persons trading as sole traders or their civil law partnerships (searchable); such companies are prohibited from performing certain activities (e.g. operating a life insurance company), and proper agricultural activity (animal breeding, plant cultivation) of an individual farmer is also excluded from registration in CEIDG; the register does not assign its own registration number, using the NIP (see below) for this purpose instead
* Ministry of Justice (MS):
 + **National Court Register** (**KRS**) (in Polish) (searchable) — register of the majority of juridical persons types, a well as other collective (private) legal entities (there are, however, numerous exceptions, see List of official business registers#Registers of businesses excluded from registration as entrepreneurs); assigns a registration number (numer KRS), mandatory to be exposed on all outbound company documents and letters; some activities (e.g. operating a school) are not available to all entities registered in KRS, but only to those who are juridical persons; members of some professions are not allowed to practise in all of the company types (e.g. an advocate is prohibited from practising the profession in the form of a limited liability company); its constituent parts are:
 - **Register of Entrepreneurs** (*Rejestr przedsiębiorców*) — the company register for entities other than natural persons which hold an obligatory status of entrepreneurs: trade partnerships: either entities with legal capacity but lacking juridical personality (registered partnerships, limited partnerships, limited joint-stock partnerships, professional partnerships), or juridical persons (limited liability companies, joint-stock companies), as well as for other types of entrepreneurs who are juridical persons, as well as any of the juridical persons registered in the Register of Associations, Other Social and Professional Organizations, Foundations and Independent Public Healthcare Institutions (see below) if they intend to perform business activities (when allowed by their bylaws, excluding the stand-alone public healthcare institutions, as they are not allowed to register as an entrepreneur, as well as those of juridical persons or other legal entities who are registered in the KRS exclusively for the purpose of obtaining status of an officially recognized charity - public benefit organization, and would otherwise be excluded from the registration in the KRS - see below)
 - **Register of Associations, Other Social and Professional Organizations, Foundations and Stand-alone Public Healthcare Institutions** (*Rejestr stowarzyszeń, innych organizacji społecznych i zawodowych, fundacji oraz samodzielnych publicznych zakładów opieki zdrowotnej*) — the other part of the KRS, is responsible for the registration of various other types of juridical persons. If any of the registered entities intend to perform business activities (when allowed by its bylaws), it also has to obtain registration in the Register of Entrepreneurs; in addition, juridical persons or any other legal entities (including those otherwise excluded or exempt from the registration in the KRS – see below) also have to register, if they apply for the status of an officially recognized charity (public benefit organization); however, as an exception, registration solely for that purpose neither confers juridical personality to entities lacking one nor does it create an obligation or right to register as an entrepreneur;
 + **Court and Commercial Gazette** (*Monitor Sądowy i Gospodarczy*) – official gazette (in Polish) (searchable);
 + **Financial document viewer** (*Przeglądarka dokumentów finansowych*) (in Polish) - the official free viewer of financial documents that allows downloading financial documents of an entity entered in the Register of Entrepreneurs of the National Court Register, in particular financial statements, reports on activities, resolutions on the allocation of profit or coverage of losses.
