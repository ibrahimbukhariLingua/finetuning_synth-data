## History and background

Bookboon started as a family business named Ventus in 1988 in Denmark. At that time, Ventus focused on publishing student textbooks. The owners of Ventus had two sons named Thomas Buus Madsen and Kristian Buus Madsen. In 2005, the two brothers took control of Ventus and in 2008 they re-named the company Bookboon. Soon after, the two brothers developed an innovative business model: offer free eBooks online financed by a few in-book ads, with a limit of 15% advertising space per book. The advertisers were companies looking to promote their career opportunities towards students and professionals.

In 2006, the company expanded its business model to Sweden, followed by Germany and the Netherlands in 2007. In 2008, Bookboon expanded its operations to the United Kingdom and started publishing eBooks in English.
