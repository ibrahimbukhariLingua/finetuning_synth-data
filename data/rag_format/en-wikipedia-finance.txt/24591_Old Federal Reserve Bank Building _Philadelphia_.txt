The main section of this building, which was designed by architect Paul Philippe Cret in the Classical Revival style with influences of the Beaux-Arts style, was built between 1931 and 1935. It incorporated the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Building, that was erected in 1889, with additions made in 1918 and 1925. Cret also designed the formal gardens, which were added in 1941.

Between 1952 and 1953, a recessed seventh story was added. It was designed by Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson, the successor firm to Cret.

The building, which features sculptures of the goddess Athena that were created by Alfred-Alphonse Bottiau, is eleven bays wide and measures 170 feet wide and 113 feet deep. It has a steel-frame structure that is faced with Vermont marble and has engaged piers.
