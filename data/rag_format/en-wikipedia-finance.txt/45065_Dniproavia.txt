# Dniproavia



**Dniproavia** (Ukrainian: Дніпроавіа) was an airline headquartered at Dnipro International Airport in Dnipro, Ukraine, which operated scheduled and chartered passenger flights.


## History

Dniproavia was established in 1933 as *Dnipropetrovsk Integrated Air Squad*, forming part of then Soviet national airline Aeroflot. On 22 June 1996, the airline became a joint stock company in a state-owned entity which included Dnipropetrovsk International Airport, thus giving the airline full control over its home base. Dniproavia announced a loss of just over 6 million USD for 2006, despite increasing revenues by 17 percent and carrying 54 percent more passengers. It blamed the loss on the suspension of its flights to Germany, due to a dispute with the German authorities over Lufthansa's landing rights at Dnipropetrovsk Airport. In October 2009, the airline was sold to Galtera investment group, however, it was controlled by Ukrainian-Israeli entrepreneur Ihor Kolomoyskyi's Privat Group.

As of 25 March 2012, as a result of the anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine's decision to allow the consolidation of the Ukrainian Aviation Group's physical and operational assets, Dniproavia no longer operates flights with its own code, but rather on behalf of its parent company Aerosvit. By mid-June 2012 the airline introduced their first Embraer 190. All Embraer 190s were ordered and operated by Dniproavia, but they were operated for the airline-partner AeroSvit.

On 9 January 2013, the company ceased all operations, but some flights were resumed on 1 February 2013.

Due to a legal dispute regarding the nationalization of the airline, most of its aircraft were transferred to Windrose Airlines, with just two remaining in the fleet of Dniproavia. In November 2017, Dniproavia was declared bankrupt. On May 15, 2020, the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the decision of the Kyiv Commercial Court, leaving the company in the ownership of a private owner.
