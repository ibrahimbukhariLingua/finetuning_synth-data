## History

In May 2017, the company announced that it was shifting its focus from the UK, where 85% of its business is, and pursuing £3 billion of projects in Latin America and Europe.

In 2019 Solarcentury announced an eightfold increase in annual profits to £14.4 million, largely due to constructing and operating unsubsidised solar farms in southern Europe, Latin America and Africa.

In November 2020, the Norwegian renewables company Statkraft announced it had acquired Solarcentury, taking full control of the company.
