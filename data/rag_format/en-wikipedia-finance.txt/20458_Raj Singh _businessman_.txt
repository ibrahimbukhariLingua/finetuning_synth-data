## Early and personal life

Singh purchased his first care home in 1994 which was in Middlesbrough. As well as being the owner of Prestige Group, Singh also runs housing development firm Redcastle Homes.


## Football


### Darlington F.C.

Singh became vice-chairman of Darlington Football Club in October 2008, appointed by then chairman of the club George Houghton until the club went into administration in February 2009. On 28 May, it was announced that he was taking over the club as chairman.

On 7 August 2009, Darlington came out of administration and were given permission by the Football League for Singh to take over as new owner and chairman of the club. Singh, together with previous owner Houghton, were confident enough to appoint manager Colin Todd in the interim period, as well as sanctioning contracts for a new playing squad. Shortly after Todd was handed a permanent deal Singh sacked Todd after he failed to win any of his first nine games and appointed Steve Staunton as his second permanent appointment.

In early 2012, Singh decided to cut his losses and placed Darlington Football Club into administration, seven months after the FA Trophy victory at Wembley in May 2011.


### Hartlepool United

Singh bought Darlington's arch-rivals Hartlepool United at the end of the 2017–18 season. He committed more than £1.2 million in cash to the club, saving it from the threat of administration and potential liquidation.

In 2020, the club was approached by Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney who were interested in purchasing Hartlepool. It was reported in *i News* that Singh was sceptical and after growing frustrated with delays from Reynolds and McElhenney, the pair moved on and purchased Wrexham instead. Speaking to the paper in May 2023, club president Jeff Stelling said "It's 100 per cent true that they wanted to buy Hartlepool and it’s ironic they went for Wrexham in the end who are going into the Football League when the club who was their first choice, which was us, are going out of the Football League." However in his programme notes before a game in October 2023, Singh denied this was the case writing that "Wrexham was always their first choice and they were keeping their options open by talking to other clubs like ourselves."

Under Singh's ownership, Hartlepool earned promotion in the 2021 play-off final after defeating Torquay United.

On 26 April 2023, in an official club statement, Singh confirmed that Hartlepool United would be put up for sale. Hartlepool were relegated back to the National League after two seasons in the Football League at the end of the 2022–23 season.

Shortly after relegation, the *Hartlepool Mail* were informed that they would be banned from attending Hartlepool home matches in future. In subsequent discussions, Singh confirmed that the decision would not be reversed. The editor of the *Hartlepool Mail* Gavin Ledwith added: "The letter was totally unexpected because the club had not indicated to us that there was a problem in the first place. Nor have they outlined with concrete evidence exactly what that apparent problem is." The ban was eventually overturned in February 2024.

On 25 January 2024, Singh rejected a takeover offer for the club from a consortium including the Hartlepool United Supporters' Trust.
