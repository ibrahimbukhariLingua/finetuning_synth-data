## Early life and education

Wierzycka grew up in Jastrzębie-Zdrój, Poland where she shared a 2 bedroom flat with her sister, brother, grandmother and parents who were medical doctors. Wierzycka’s Jewish grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. With the gradual economic collapse of Poland due to political sanctions and the subsequent imposition of martial law, Wierzycka moved with her family in 1982 to Austria where they lived for a year in the Polish refugee camp at Traiskirchen. Her parents were forced to dig ditches to earn a living. Her family moved to South Africa in 1983 when she was just thirteen years old, with only USD500 in their bank account. The family settled in Sunnyside, Pretoria, where she attended Pretoria High School for Girls. Wierzycka had to learn English and Afrikaans swiftly because they are the primary media of instruction in South African schools and she spoke neither of the languages. She then attended the University of Cape Town where she graduated with a Bachelor of Business Science and a Postgraduate diploma in actuarial science in 1993 because it was the only degree for which she could receive a bursary.
