The **Greenstream pipeline**, part of the Western Libyan Gas Project, is a natural gas submarine pipeline running from western Libya to the island of Sicily in Italy.


## History

The idea of natural gas from Libya to Italy originating from the 1970s. Feasibility studies were carried out in the 1980s and 1990s. Construction of the pipeline started in 2003.
