## History

In 1999, Ted Brandt and Gregg Elesh co-founded Marathon Capital. Brandt serves as the CEO. Both had backgrounds in commercial finance, leasing, and structured finance. During 2001, Marathon Capital began its focus on alternative energy. The firm competes with “bulge bracket” firms for its engagements. Marathon Capital periodically acts as a co-manager with other investment banks to facilitate client transactions. Marathon Capital has been involved in several high-profile wind power mandates from American Wind Capital Corporation (USA), Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation (USA), EchoFirst (USA), SkyPower Corp. (Canada), Allco Finance Group (Australia) and Greenlight Energy (USA).

Marathon Capital has handled the transactions for the following clients: American Wind Capital Company's sale of company and portfolio to Hannon Armstrong; Suzlon's sale of 240MW Big Sky Wind Farm to EverPower, the restructuring and sale of Middlesex Generation to General Electric (landfill gas to electric); Steamboat II/III to Ormat Technologies (Geothermal); the sale of Greenlight Energy to BP plc (Wind), AMP Resources to Enel (Geothermal), Heelstone Energy Holdings LLC to Sammons Renewable Energy, OCI Solar Power’s 66MW Project Ivory to Desri, Empower Energies’ DG Solar Fund, CPV Wind to Iberdrola (Wind), SkyPower Corp. to Lehman Brothers (Wind and Solar) and Ridgeline Energy to Veolia Environment (Wind). The sale of the project by Allco Finance Group generated cash proceeds of A$346 million.
