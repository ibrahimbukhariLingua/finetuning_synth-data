Saudi Central Bank


# Saudi Central Bank



The **Saudi Central Bank** (Arabic: البنك المركزي السعودي), previously known as the **Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority** (**SAMA**; Arabic: مؤسسة النقد العربي السعودي), established in 1952, is the central bank of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Despite the name change in 2020, the Saudi Central Bank has continued to use the same acronym (SAMA).


## History

Prior to the establishment of the Saudi Central Bank, the Saudi Hollandi Bank, a branch of the Netherlands Trading Society from 1926 acted as a de facto central bank. It kept the Kingdom's gold reserves and received oil revenues on behalf of the Saudi Arabian government. In 1928 it assisted in the establishment of a new Saudi silver coin, commissioned by King Abdulaziz which became the Kingdom's first independent currency. The Saudi Hollandia Bank handed over its responsibilities to the SAMA when it was established in 1952 and became a model for other foreign banks in the kingdom. The building's current headquarters, which was built in 1985 was designed by American architect Minoru Yamasaki.

The modern central bank operates through regulatory infrastructure developed by Irish firm Vizor. In March 2020 and April 2020, SAMA moved 150 billion Saudi riyals (US$40 billion) to the Public Investment Fund (PIF). US$25 billion was transferred in April and US$15 billion in May.


## Functions
