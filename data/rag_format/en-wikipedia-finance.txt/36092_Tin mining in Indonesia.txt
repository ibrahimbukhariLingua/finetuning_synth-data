Tin mining in Indonesia


# Tin mining in Indonesia



Indonesia is the world's second-largest producer of tin and its largest exporter. Tin mining activities in Indonesia are concentrated in the Bangka Belitung Islands province with some production in nearby areas. Exports of tin from the region predated European colonization, with the Dutch East India Company commencing commercial exploitation of the resource in the 18th century. Large mining concerns controlled tin production throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century under both the Dutch and Indonesian governments.

Following the restructuring of the state-owned mining company PT Timah and the fall of President Suharto in the 1990s, small-scale artisanal tin mining had become the dominant producer in the country. The wide extent of mining activities on Bangka and Belitung has had significant environmental impact, with a large number of unreclaimed mining pits or *kolong* covering the islands' landscape. Smuggling and child labor have become issues in the industry. Poor safety measures have also resulted in hundreds of miners being killed in accidents.


## History

Small-scale mining of tin in modern Indonesia might have begun in Bangka by the 7th century; some exports of tin from Bangka are dated to the 13th century. After the arrival of the Dutch in the region, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) signed a treaty with the Palembang Sultanate which granted the VOC monopoly rights over Bangka's tin trade in 1722. Tin mining was further developed in Bangka in the 18th century, with migrant workers from China working the mines. Large tin deposits were further discovered in 1823 at the neighboring island of Belitung, and Billiton Maatschappij (today part of BHP) was founded to exploit Belitung's tin, obtaining a concession over the island's mineral rights in 1860. Billiton continued operations for some time after Indonesian independence, until Dutch mining operations in Indonesia were seized in 1958.

The Indonesian state-owned PT TimahÂ [id] company was established in 1976 to exploit the deposits in Bangka and Belitung. Due to declines in global tin prices, the company underwent large-scale restructurization in 1990, laying off 26,000 employees. Following the fall of Suharto in 1998, deregulation of mining activities resulted in a boom of small-scale mining activities, with a large proportion being illegal. It was estimated in 2019 that small-scale miners made up 60% of Indonesian tin production and covered 50,000 workers. PT Timah alone employed or outsourced around 10,000 workers in 2023.

Another major tin mining center was Singkep, near Bangka and Belitung but part of Riau Islands. Legal mining operations on the island ceased in 1991 following Timah's restructurization, although illegal mining activities continued on the island with some arrests in 2023.
