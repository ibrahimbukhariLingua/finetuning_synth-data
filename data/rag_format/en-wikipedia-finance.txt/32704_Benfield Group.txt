## History

The company was established as a Lloyd's broker in 1973 as Benfield, Lovick, and Rees & Company (BLR). In 1988, a management buyout led to the formation of Benfield Group.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the company grew through a series of mergers with Ellinger Heath Western, Greig Fester, and E.W. Blanch. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2003.

On 22 August 2008, Chicago-based Aon Corporation announced that it had agreed to acquire Benfield Group. The $1.43 billion deal was completed on 28 November 2008. Aon's reinsurance broking business continued to operate under the name Aon Benfield until 2018.
