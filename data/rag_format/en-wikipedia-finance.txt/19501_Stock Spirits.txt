## History


### Stock history

In 1884 Lionello Stock and his partner Carlo Camis founded the steam wine distillery "Distilleria a vapore Camis & Stock". His company's main product was cognac "Medicinal", which competed with French alternatives in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and German Empire territory. By the 1920s the Stock company was one of the largest companies of its kind in Europe. In 1920, after Austro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed, Stock bought a distillery factory at Plzeň Božkov (in the then Czechoslovakia). Stock eventually came to own a network of distilleries, bottling plants and ageing facilities in Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Croatia. He also expanded business and established an outpost in New York City, United States.

In 2007 Oaktree Capital Management acquired Polmos Lublin in 2006 and merged it with Eckes & Stock, to create Stock Spirits Group in 2008.

In 2012, the Stock Spirits Group completed acquisition of Slovak company Imperator Ltd located in Drietoma, Slovakia.
