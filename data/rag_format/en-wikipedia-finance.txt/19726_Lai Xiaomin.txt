Later, he was educated at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, majoring in economics management, where he graduated in 1983 and obtained a bachelor's degree.

Beginning in July 1987, he served in several posts in the People's Bank of China, including deputy division director, division director, and deputy department director. In April 2003, he was transferred to China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), where he worked until December 2005. He was promoted to Chinese Communist Party Deputy Committee Secretary and president of China Huarong Asset Management in January 2009. In September 2012 he was promoted again to become its party secretary and chairman of the board, the top political position in the company.

Lai was a member of Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Party secretary of China Huarong Asset Management's CCP Committee. As the CCP Committee Secretary, he emphasized in 2015 that during the operation of China Huarong Asset Management, CCP Committee should play a central role, and party members should play an exemplary role.


### Investigation

On 17 April 2018, Lai was put under investigation for alleged "serious violations of discipline and laws" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party's internal disciplinary body, and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China. He was expelled from the CCP and removed from office on 15 October 2018.

In January 2020, Lai confessed in a state TV documentary broadcast to stashing over 200 million yuan in cabinets at his apartment. Lai reportedly had safes and cupboards full of cash inside a Beijing flat he nicknamed “the supermarket”. He was also said to have held gold bars and luxury cars, a bank account in his mother's name holding hundreds of millions of yuan, and more than 100 mistresses to whom he gave properties developed by a real estate subsidiary of Huarong. Despite this, Lai noted that he "did not spend a single penny".

On 11 August 2020, the Second Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin heard his case in public. He pled guilty to accepting 1.79 billion yuan (US$257.7 million) in bribes, and being involved in other corruption and bigamy over a period of ten years. The court confiscated all of Lai's personal assets including lavish goods such as properties, luxury watches and show cars.
