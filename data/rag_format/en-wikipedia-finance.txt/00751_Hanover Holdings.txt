Hanover Holdings


# Hanover Holdings



**Hanover Holdings Limited** was a property development group based in Melbourne, Australia.

The company was founded in 1958 "for the purpose of providing hire purchase finance for the expanding business of the Allan group." It operated as such until 1969, when developers **Paul Fayman, Maurice Alter** and **George Herscu** acquired a majority of its issued shares. They transformed it into a development conglomerate which had interests in regional shopping centres, residential subdivision, industrial estates, hotels, theatres, bowling alleys, speculative land buying and home construction.

Hanover was a prominent figure in the 1970s Australian property sector and rode the crest of the property boom, boosting reported profits of $67,792 in the 1968–69 financial year to a peak of over $1.8m in 1972–73. The bubble burst in 1974, causing profits to plummet to $631,000, and the company was privatised in the following years.


## History


### Allans Finance

In June 1958, music and appliance retailer Allan & Co announced plans to form a company which would handle all the hire-purchase financing previously carried out by the Allans Group. Allans Finance Limited was registered on 14 July 1958 with a nominal capital of £1 million. Appointed directors were Sir Frank Tate, G. H. Allan, R. L. Montgomery, A. McB. Fairfoul and W. G. Hall. The company's initial issue of 500,000 ordinary 5/ shares at par was heavily oversubscribed.

In May 1959, Allans Finance took over the hire purchase business previously conducted by the Hartley-Edments store chain. This was in a bid to secure additional outlet for the company's funds, which had been employed financing various retailers in the electrical appliance, music instrument, radio, TV and furniture fields. In its 1959/1960 annual report, the company chairman announced plans to diversify Allans Finance by expanding the scope of is investments. These expansion plans were financed by issue of first mortgage debenture stock.


### Formation of Hanover Holdings

When developers Maurice Alter and George Herscu were inspecting shops at Paul Fayman's recently extended Forest Hill Shopping Centre in mid-1967, Herscu suddenly blurted out "Why just buy the shops? I want to buy the whole centre." The three got along and had a lot in common they were hard working, Jewish men with an interest in property development, and who'd settled in Australia after surviving the horrors against their families in Nazi Germany.

By July 1967, the trio had moved into an office at 6 Riddell Parade, Elsternwick. In March 1969, they created a back door into the Melbourne Stock Exchange when their company **Masaga Investments** bought out about 64% control of **Allans Finance**; the publicly-listed hire-purchase subsidiary of **Allan & Co**. Subsequently, Allans Finance was transformed into a holdings company, officially re-listed as **Hanover Holdings** on 20th May 1969. The companies associated with it's new directors Maurice Alter, Paul Fayman and George Herscu were progressively incorporated as subsidiaries in the resulting months.


### Bid for London Stores

In October 1969, Hanover made a $3.4m (AUD$49.8m in 2024) takeover offer for **London Stores Ltd.**, a city and suburban department store group. Hanover had been buying shares in Londons Stores in the months leading up to the offer. The **Slater Walker** group, through **Beau Monde** quashed the Hanover bid with an offer nearly 40 percent greater. Hanover made a capital profit of $97,962 (AUD$1.3m in 2024) on its London Stores takeover bid. Chairman Alwynne Rowlands said the directors thought it was more prudent to sell the shares already held than make an increased offer.


### Interstate activities

Hanover Holdings was listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange on 21 January 1971 and a regional office was established in late 1972. In November 1972, company Chairman James Hemphill announced that Hanover would kickstart it's Sydney operations with a commercial and retail development project in the inner suburb of Marrickville worth $10m (AUD$1.26m in 2024). Textile Holdings had sold the 10-acre site, bounded by Sydenham Park and Livingstone Roads, to Hanover under a conditional contract. Although Marrickville Council had given approval to build a shopping centre with two major department stores, 80 variety shops and parking for 2000 cars, the project never eventuated.

In January 1973, Hanover Holdings linked with the Kornhauser Family in a $2.4m (AUD$27.7m in 2024) million effort to keep Australian National Hotels (ANH) locally owned. Their offer came just a week after ANH announced it would raise $3.5 million ($40.4m in 2024)by selling a big slice of the company to Asian interests. The offer, which provided that the 10 million shares be taken up in equal quantities by Hanover and the Kornhauser Family, was ultimately rejected by ANH. Around the time of the failed bid, Hanover Holdings struck a deal with the Kornhauser family, buying half of its interest in the Chevron Hotel at St Kilda Road. In conjunction with the deal, the Kornhauser family got a 25 percent interest in a project Hanover had going in Surfers Paradise - designated as Hanover Surfers Paradise (HSP). The plan envisaged construction of a $30 million hotel-casino on the historic Surfers Paradise Hotel site, which had been purchased for $4.7 million.

In January, 1974, the Kornhauser-Hanover partnership announced plans to redevelop the St Kilda Road Chevron Hotel at a cost of $30 million and applied for a licence to run a casino in the basement. Twenty-three other applications for a casino licence in Victoria had been made and in April 1976, a Cabinet sub-committee recommended that a licence be issued. However, the Parliamentary Liberal Party of Victoria rejected the idea by what was estimated as a three to one vote. The official police view, as put by Inspector Fred (The Cat) Sylvester, chief of the Vice and Gaming Squad, was that a casino should not be allowed in Victoria. Eventually in 1976, the Chevron, apart from the bistro, was sold to the adjoining Alfred Hospital. Hanover's annual report of November, 1975 indicated that the Hanover-Kornhauser partnership had been dissolved. In 1976, Emil "Eddie" Kornhauser bought out Hanover's interest in the Hanover Surfers Paradise project, which was being managed by a company called HSP Nominees.


### Bid for Australian Mont de Piete Loan and Deposit Co.

In March 1971, Hanover made a $631,872 (AUD$8.4m in 2024) offer to takeover local pawn broker, the Australian Mont de Piete Loan and Deposit Co. Hanover directors considered pawnbroking 'unfashionable" and that company's earning rate had been low compared with companies providing other forms of personal finance. The day after Hanover's offer, A. Monte's stock price jumped from $1.32 to $4 a share. In May 1971, Directors of A. Monte recommended against its shareholders accepting the takeover offer, which was ultimately withdrawn by Hanover in June 1971.


### Landall investment

Beginning in mid-1973, Hanover began acquiring interest in Perth-based home builder Landall Holdings. By February 1974, Hanover had accumulated a 15.74 percent interest in the company and speculation of a takeover offer grew. On 5 April 1974, directors of both companies announced that Hanover would pay $1,277,500 to lift their stake in Landall from 16 to 49 per cent. Hanover directors undertook not to acquire more than 51 per cent of Landall without an offer to all shareholders, and said no offer was envisaged. Hanover sold three development sites to Landall, guaranteed loan funds worth $500,000 and provided real estate and finance expertise. This was part of a long-term plan for the two groups to co-operate in future with residential developments. Landall fell victim to the 1974/75 Credit Squeeze, experienced multi-million dollar losses, and was ultimately placed into receivership.


### Dissolution

Much to the outrage of the minority shareholders, the Alter-Fayman-Herscu triumvirate announced plans to privatise Hanover in October 1975. They made an offer for the remaining shares, which turned out to be significantly below the real value of its assets. In March 1976, the three directors declared that the acquisition was unconditional and their bid was processed shortly thereafter. Hanover Holdings was officially delisted from the stock exchange on 24th March 1976 and its assets were divided between the directors over the following two years.

According to a merchant banker familiar with the company, the leadership dynamic at Hanover was marked by individual egos that made constructive collaboration nearly impossible. The banker described the directors as having inflated senses of self-importance, with Maurice Alter believing himself to be the most intellectually superior, Paul Fayman seeing himself as the most cultured, and George Herscu convinced he was the most daring.

A few years after Hanover Holdings was privatised, directors Maurice Alter, Paul Fayman, and George Herscu were exposed for their involvement in a large-scale tax avoidance scheme, which was uncovered by government investigators in 1978. The scheme, which involved falsifying company returns by using fake names and addresses, was estimated to have cost the Federal Government $200 million in lost revenue. This discovery prompted an official inquiry led by the Liberal government's Corporate Affairs Office. Investigators, including barrister Patrick McCabe and investigator David Lafranchi, gathered evidence that implicated numerous individuals, with Hanover's directors among the primary beneficiaries.
