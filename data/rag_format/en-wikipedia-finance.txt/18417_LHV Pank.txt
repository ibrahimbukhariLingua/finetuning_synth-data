# LHV Pank



**LHV Pank** (originally **Lõhmus, Haavel & Viisemann**) is an Estonian banking and financial services company headquartered in Tallinn. It is a subsidiary of AS LHV Group, a public company listed on the Nasdaq Tallinn Stock Exchange. The bank's clients include private individuals, small and medium-sized companies and institutional investors. LHV Pank is the third largest bank in Estonia. LHV has branch offices in Tallinn, Tartu and Pärnu. LHV Pank employs over 800 people. More than 350 000 clients use the bank's services. LHV Pank is one of the largest brokers on NASDAQ OMX Baltic stock exchanges and the largest broker for Baltic retail investors in international markets.

LHV Pank was fully cash-free—operating only with electronic transfers and card payments—until August 2015, when they opened their first ten Automated teller machine (nine in Tallinn and one in Tartu).

LHV Pank has been identified as a partner in the virtual e-residency of Estonia program, enabling e-residents to open a bank account in Estonia.

Starting November 2018, the bank decided to charge all non-residents and their controlled companies (which includes e-residents and their companies) €10 in case of EU/EEA residents or €20 of others monthly, citing the need for extra financial and anti-laundering control.

LHV has been designated in 2022 as a Significant Institution under the criteria of European Banking Supervision, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank. This designation is based on a quantitative assessment that concluded on the bank's national economic importance vis-à-vis Estonia's GDP.
