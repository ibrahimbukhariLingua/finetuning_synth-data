## Critique of Loss Aversion and Behavioral Economics

Loss aversion is the principle that losses loom larger than gains. It was introduced by the economics Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a 1979 paper that is the most cited in economics and third most cited in psychology.

Gal has argued that loss aversion is not supported by the evidence and that most phenomena attributed to loss aversion have alternative explanations that are more consistent with the evidence. In particular, Gal has cited psychological inertia as an explanation for the endowment effect and status quo bias.

In addition to his specific critique of loss aversion, Gal has argued that behavioral economics more broadly has been too concerned with understanding *how* behavior deviates from standard economic models rather than with understanding *why* people behave the way they do. Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of science. He has referred to behavioral economics as a triumph of marketing.
