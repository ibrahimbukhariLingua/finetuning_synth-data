## History

Württembergische Versicherung was founded in 1828. The beginnings of the Gemeinschaft der Freunde Wüstenrot (GdF), today Wüstenrot Bausparkasse AG, date back to 1921. Their headquarters are in Ludwigsburg. It is the oldest building society in Germany. It was named after the small Swabian village of Wüstenrot, where the building society was founded.

In 1999, Wüstenrot merged with Württembergische. The merger to form Wüstenrot & Württembergische created one of the ten leading financial service providers in Germany. Other companies emerged from the merger, including W&W Informatik, which was founded in 2002. Wüstenrot Lebensversicherung was integrated into Württembergische Lebensversicherung in 2000.

In 2001, Wüstenrot Bausparkasse merged with Leonberger Bausparkasse to form the third largest private building society in Germany. In 2002, Allgemeine Rentenanstalt Lebensversicherung (ARA), in which unit-linked business was bundled, merged with Württembergische Lebensversicherung. In 2003, the securities management of the insurance companies was transferred to W&W Asset Management; the external reinsurance business of Wüstenrot & Württembergische was discontinued and Wüstenrot hypotečni banka was founded in Prague.

In 2005, Wüstenrot Bank and Wüstenrot Hypothekenbank merged to form Wüstenrot Bank AG Pfandbriefbank with headquarters in Ludwigsburg.
