## Pay for Success

Pay for Success (PFS) is a contracting model that drives government resources toward high-performing social programs. PFS contracts track the effectiveness of programs over time to ensure that funding is directed toward programs that succeed in measurably improving the lives of people most in need.

Massachusetts was the first state in the nation to issue a competitive procurement process to obtain services using social innovation financing. Third Sector was selected to help lead both of the Commonwealthâ€™s initial pilots through to implementation. Third Sector Capital Partners, Inc. has also launched projects in Santa Clara County, California, Salt Lake County, Utah, and Cuyahoga County, Ohio.
