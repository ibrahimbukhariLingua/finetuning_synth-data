**The European Association for Banking and Financial History (*eabh*)** is an independent, non-profit association based in Frankfurt am Main. Founded in 1990, *eabh* aims to promote research on banking history; support the preservation historically valuable archive material of public and private banking institutions; and facilitate dialogue on key challenges and opportunities to the historical study of finance, insurance, and globalization. It maintains a global network of financial professionals and academics who meet to discuss and encourage projects in the field of financial and banking history. The *eabh* currently has 80 member organisations.


## Foundation

The European Association for Banking History e.V. (*eabh*) was founded on 29 November 1990 in an inaugural meeting at the premises of Deutsche Bank, in Frankfurt am Main, by 22 banking institutions and one academic institution from 20 European countries. Manfred Pohl, German business historian and head of ‘Historisches Institut der Deutschen Bank’ (1972–2000), was responsible for the creation of the forum that would lead to the foundation of *eabh*. During the ‘European Colloquium on Banking History’ held in Frankfurt on 9 February 1989 Pohl launched the idea of creating an association for banking history and decided to gather European scholars and banking institutions’ archivists in a working group to draft the first statutes. Other members of the first *eabh* Board of Management were Wilfried Guth, chairman of the Board of Patrons; Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman; Herman Van der Wee, Chairman of the Academic Advisory Council; Pedro Martinez Mendez, Treasurer and Robert Lion, Member.

Wim Duisenberg, then president of De Nederlandsche Bank, opened the first annual *eabh* conference, ‘How to Write the History of a Bank’ on 16 September 1992. Two members of *eabh*, Youssef Cassis and Philip L. Cottrell, subsequently began the organisation's dedicated academic journal, the *Financial History Review*.

On 7 December 2000, *eabh* celebrated its 10th anniversary at a Deutsche Bank symposium, 'Banking in the Mirror of Time’. On 28 May 2004 the Association conducted a general survey in the 15th General Members’ Meeting and decided to change its name to *eabh* (European Association for Banking and Financial History e.V.), as a commitment to embracing financial history in a wider sense.

In 2018, *eabh* added its first member institution on the African continent, the Banco de Moçambique.
