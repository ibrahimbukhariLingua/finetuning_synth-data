Société Anonyme de Gérance et d'Armement


# Société Anonyme de Gérance et d'Armement



The Rothschild Bank founded the **Société Anonyme de Gérance et d'Armement** (also known by its acronym **SAGA**) in 1919 for the management of French state-owned ships.


## History

In 1920, SAGA operated the coal fleet of the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Nord, a railway company also owned by the Rothschild group.

Acquisitions:

* 1926 *Compagnie des Bateaux à Vapeur du Nord*
* 1934 *Union Maritime*
* 1935 *Compagnie Franco-Africaine de Navigation*
* 1939 *Société Navale de l'Ouest*. Founded to operate scheduled services to Algeria and West Africa.
* 1963 *Société Nationale d'Affrêtements*. Founded in 1916 by the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée to transport coal imported from England. Nationalised by the French Government in 1937, the company was owned by SNCF but maintained its own management until 1963 when the company and its eight ships were purchased by SAGA.

Subsidiaries

* 1927 *Angleterre-Lorraine-Alsace Société Anonyme de Navigation*. This company operated services between Tilbury and Dunkirk. Later the English port was changed to Folkestone. All services were abandoned in 1936.
* 1929 *Compagnie Chérifienne d'Armements*
* 1957 *Société Navale de la Sanaga* (jointly with Péchiney),
* 1964 *CETRAMAR* (jointly with Chargeurs Réunis, Louis-Dreyfus and Union Navale),
* 1965 *Normandy Ferries* (jointly with General Steam Navigation Company). Later bought out by P&O Ferries to become P&O Normandy Ferries.

Between 1968 and 1982 SAGA withdrew from shipping services and now as part of Bolloré Investissement SA provides sea, air, and inland transport services.
