## History

**Inception**
Freedom Plus, now Achieve Personal Loans, started a pilot program in 2008 that made unsecured loans to consumers struggling with their existing debt. The company lent $25 million to people who had average FICO scores of 576. Average loan balances were greater than $15,000, and annual default rates were less than 2%. Interest rates are 3.75% above prime consumer debt rates.

**Name Change**
In September 2022, FreedomPlus changed its name to Achieve Personal Loans, part of Achieve Company.
