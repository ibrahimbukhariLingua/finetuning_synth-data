## History

Mystifly was founded in 2009 by Rajeev Kumar. He first got into global airfare consolidation as an idea in 2006 while he was looking for a London-India fare. The fare that Indian travel agencies quoted was much higher than it would be if he had bought it in London, and that’s when he realised how the industry worked. Further research and a few months of technology and process consulting helped solidify the idea, and gave birth to Mystifly.

Mystifly launched its application programming interface (API) at the WIT Conference in 2011.

Mystifly raised $5 million in Series A funding round led by RSI I Fund LLC, operated by Japanese private equity firm Recruit Holdings Co. Ltd. With this, the Japanese investor has a minority stake in the company.

In Nov, 2019 Mystifly launched travel industry’s first API for guaranteed & automated Voids, Refunds and Cancellation for flight tickets. Followed by that, in Feb, 2020 Mystifly announced the launch of New Generation Airline Retailing & Shopping API Platform ASR Hub 1.0 with branded fares feature. Recently, the company has managed to raise a Pre-Series B round of US$3.3 million from its existing investor, Recruit Co. Ltd.
