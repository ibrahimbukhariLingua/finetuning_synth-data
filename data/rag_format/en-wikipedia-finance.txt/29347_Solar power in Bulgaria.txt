Solar power in Bulgaria


# Solar power in Bulgaria



Solar power generated 12% of Bulgaria’s electricity in 2023.

By the end of 2020 about 1 GW of solar PV had been installed. It has been estimated that there is potential for at least another 4 GW by 2030.

On March 13, 2023, peak photovoltaics power was 30% of Bulgaria electricity generation. However, long-term share of solar power is much lower. Director of Bulgarian transmission network estimated photovoltaics growth as 30% in 2022, also he expects 700 MW new solar capacity in 2023, which could represent 30-40% YoY growth.

In April 2023 Bulgaria's Inercom signed contract with Huasun for supply of 1.5GW solar modules.


## History

Solar power in Bulgaria has expanded by 100 megawatts (MW) in 2011. A 16.2 MW solar power plant in Zdravetz, Bulgaria was expected to be completed in June 2012, with power being sold for $0.30/kWh in a fixed rate 20 year power purchase agreement.

Since then, however, new installations have nearly come to a halt with only about 12 MW of additional capacity installed during 2013 and 2014.
