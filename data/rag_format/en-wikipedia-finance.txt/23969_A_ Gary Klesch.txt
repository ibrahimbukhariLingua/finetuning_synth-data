Klesch then came to the attention of Bill Simon, who had just been appointed Secretary of the Treasury under President Gerald Ford, and in 1975, aged 28, he was appointed Director of Capital Markets Policy.

He also served as the US Government's representative on the Board of the United States Railway Association, where he played a role in the negotiation and reorganization of troubled railroad companies, most notably the Penn Central Corporation. Additionally, he was responsible for finding private finance for the space shuttle.

In 1978, after two and half years in Washington, Klesch took a sabbatical and then joined the management of Smith Barney Harris Upham & International Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company, Inc. | Better Business Bureau Profile, the Wall Street securities house, in Paris.

## Criticism

Klesch has been described in the media as a “vulture capitalist” due to a history of investing in struggling businesses and slashing costs.

In 2012, Klesch & Co bought the vinyl business division of Arkema for one symbolic euro. Once the acquisition went through the company was renamed ‘Kem One S.A.’. 8 months after the acquisition, the company was declared insolvent putting 1,300 jobs at risk until in December 2013, when industrialist Alain de Krassny agreed to take over the business in association with OpenGate, a global fund.

The events involving Klesch and Arkema were later referenced by employees at a steel factory in Sardinia owned by Alcoa as they protested against reports that Klesch & Co were exploring a possible takeover.
