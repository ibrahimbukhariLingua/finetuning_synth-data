Alex Sink launched an unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2010, and was succeeded by Jeff Atwater. Atwater resigned and then-governor Rick Scott appointed Jimmy Patronis to the post. Patronis won a statewide election and retained the post in 2018 and again in 2022. On November 25, 2024, Patronis announced his resignation from Chief Financial Officer of Florida effective March 31, 2025, to run for the special election for the seat Matt Gaetz held prior to his November 2024 resignation.
