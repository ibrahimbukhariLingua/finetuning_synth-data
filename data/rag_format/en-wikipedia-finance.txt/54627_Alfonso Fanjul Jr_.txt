# Alfonso Fanjul Jr.



**Alfonso "Alfy" Fanjul Jr.** (born 1937) is an American billionaire businessman, and the eldest of the Fanjul brothers, who control a sugar and real estate business valued at US$8.2 billion. Alfy Fanjul is often criticized as the Fanjul brother that most often donates to the Democratic Party seeking political favors, and in particular, seeking to ensure the continuation of the governmental price support of sugar that the Fanjul family company, Domino Sugar, most directly benefits from.


## Early life

He is the eldest son of Alfonso Fanjul Sr. and his wife Lillian Rosa Gomez-Mena. He has a bachelor's degree from Fordham University in New York.


## Career

In 1982, he became chairman of Flo-Sun Land Corporation, the family holding company, following the death of his father.

In 1987, his net worth was estimated at US$500 million.

He and his brother, José Fanjul, both hold Spanish and American passports. They are close friends of the ex-King Juan Carlos and have stated on various occasions that they would be willing to receive the exiled king as a guest in any of their mansions around the world.


## Personal life

His divorce from Tina Fanjul, mother of his children, was finalized in 2000 in Florida. She runs Tina Fanjul Associates Inc. Real Estate, which was founded in 1977, and sells property in south Florida and the Dominican Republic.

Their daughter Crista is a marine biology graduate of the University of Miami, and is married to Allan "Tad" Ryan Jr.

Their youngest daughter, Lillian, is an interior designer, and married to Luis Fernandez. Fernandez is executive vice president and CFO of Florida Crystals, a Fanjul family company, and co-president of American Sugar Refining.

He has been married to Raysa Fanjul since at least 2010.


## Criticism

Swedish author and historian of ideas, Johan Norberg commented in his book *The Capitalist Manifesto: Why the Global Free Market Will Save the World* published in 2023 that:

> Among the most successful American welfare queens are the brothers Alfonso and José Fanjul in Florida, who receive around $65 million in subsidies for their sugar empire annually. They use part of that money to buy political support for a continued stream of subsidies in their direction. The best that can be said about them is that they don't contribute to political polarization. During the irreconcilable presidential election campaign in 2016, the Fanjul brothers protected themselves by holding one fundraiser for Trump and one for Clinton.
