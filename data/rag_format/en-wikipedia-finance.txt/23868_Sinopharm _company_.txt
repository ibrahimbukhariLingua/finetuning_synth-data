## History

Sinopharm was founded as **China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation** (Chinese: 中国医药集团总公司) on November 26, 1998, as a holding company for China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, China National Pharmaceutical Industry Corporation (Chinese: 中国医药工业公司), China National Pharmaceutical Foreign Trade Corp. (Chinese: 中国医药对外贸易公司) and China National Medical Device (Chinese: 中国医疗器械工业公司). In 2009 it was merged with China National Biotec Group (Chinese: 中国生物技术集团公司).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Its subsidiary Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was fined for selling 400,520 ineffective DPT vaccines in November 2017.

Pfizer announced the signing of a cooperation pact with Sinopharm Group in April 2023, with plans to seep approval for 12 drugs in China through 2025.


## COVID-19 vaccines

The **Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine**, also known as **BBIBP-CorV**, the **Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine**, or **BIBP vaccine**, is one of two inactivated virus COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinopharm. It completed Phase III trials in Argentina, Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with over 60,000 participants. BBIBP-CorV shares similar technology with CoronaVac and BBV152, other inactivated virus vaccines for COVID-19.

Peer-reviewed results published in JAMA of Phase III trials in United Arab Emirates and Bahrain showed BBIBP-CorV 78.1% effective against symptomatic cases and 100% against severe cases (21 cases in vaccinated group vs. 95 cases in placebo group). In December 2020, the UAE previously announced interim results showing 86% efficacy. While mRNA vaccines like the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and mRNA-1273 showed higher efficacy of over 90%, those present distribution challenges for some nations as they require deep-freeze facilities and trucks. BIBP-CorV could be transported and stored at normal refrigerated temperatures.

BBIBP-CorV is being used in vaccination campaigns by certain countries in Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe. Sinopharm expects to produce one billion doses of BBIBP-CorV in 2021. On 7 May 2021, the World Health Organization approved the vaccine for emergency use and Sinopharm later signed purchase agreements for 170 million doses from COVAX.

The similarly named Sinopharm WIBP COVID-19 vaccine is also an inactivated virus vaccine.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
