The **Wroclaw University of Economics and Business** *(Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny we Wrocławiu)* is one of ten public universities located in Wrocław, Poland. Originally established in 1947 as a private business school (then named *Wyższa Szkoła Handlowa*, or "Trade College"), it was nationalized in 1954 under the name *Wyższa Szkoła Ekonomiczna* ("College of Economics").
