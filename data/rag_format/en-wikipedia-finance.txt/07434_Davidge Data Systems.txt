# Davidge Data Systems



**Davidge Data Systems** Corporation was "a privately held software company that specializes in middleware for trade ordering, execution and back-office connectivity for Wall Street firms," including Smart order routing.

The company's *DavNet* includes the ability to efficiently handle large volumes of small orders.


## History

Davidge, founded 1982, was acquired by *S1 Corporation*, a holding company, in April, 2000, for about $20 million, at a time when it seemed that "banks in the U.S. were going to control much of the retail brokerage" industry, especially as related to online trading. S1 sold Davidge to Paris-based GL-trade in October, 2003.

At that time, Davidge software was used for "40% of US listed options volume and served "40 New York Stock Exchange members ... and several of the 10 largest brokerage firms."

Their international order routing includes Canada and Britain.
