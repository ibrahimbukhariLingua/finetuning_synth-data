He left Bain in 1991, to work briefly at GE Capital, as vice president of business development and strategic planning.

In 1992, he left GE Capital to co-found the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group (now TPG Capital), with David Bonderman and James Coulter. In their first major deal, in 1993 they completed the leveraged buyout of Continental Airlines.

During his tenure, Price was also involved with all of TPG's subsequent investments, most notably Beringer, Petco, Ducati and Grohe.

Price lives in Sonoma, California. He is married and has three children.

In the summer of 2020, Price contributed to the political campaign of Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who had promised to oppose any tax increases on either corporate or personal rates, by giving Sinema a week-long paid internship at his Sonoma, California winery, and by hosting a fundraiser at the winery that benefitted her campaign committee and a leadership PAC for fellow congressional moderates.
