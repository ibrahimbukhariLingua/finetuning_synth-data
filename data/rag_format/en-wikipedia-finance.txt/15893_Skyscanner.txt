**Skyscanner Ltd.** is a search aggregator and travel agency based in Edinburgh, Scotland and operating since 2003.


## History

The company was formed by three information technology professionals. The Edinburgh office was opened in 2004.

In 2009, the year after SEP invested in the business, Skyscanner reported its first profit.

In 2011, Skyscanner acquired Zoombu. Skyscanner opened an office in Singapore in September 2011, which is headquarters for its Asia-Pacific operations. In 2012, a Beijing office was added, as Skyscanner began a partnership with Baidu, China's largest search engine.

By 2013, the company employed over 180 people. In February 2013, Skyscanner announced plans to open a United States base in Miami. In October 2013, Sequoia Capital purchased an interest in Skyscanner that valued the company at $800 million. In June 2014, Skyscanner acquired Youbibi, a travel search engine company based in Shenzhen, China.

By February 2015, the company employed 600 people, double the employment of 18 months earlier.

In January 2016, the company raised $192 million based on a $1.6 billion valuation for the company.

In November 2016, a Chinese company Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip) bought Skyscanner for $1.75 billion. Following the sale to Ctrip, Skyscanner's largest shareholder, SEP, completed its exit from the business.

In 2017, Ctrip bought the Trip.com domain and launched Trip.com. The original platform became a subsidiary of Skyscanner.

In 2020, after COVID-19, the company announced that it would lay off 300 employees (20% of its staff). It was likely to close two offices in Budapest, Hungary and Sofia, Bulgaria.
