Health care in Turkey


# Health care in Turkey

 

**Healthcare in Turkey** consists of a mix of public and private health services. Turkey introduced universal health care in 2003. Known as Universal Health Insurance *Genel Sağlık Sigortası*, it is funded by a tax surcharge on employers, currently at 5%. Public-sector funding covers approximately 75.2% of health expenditures.

Despite universal health care, total expenditure on health as a share of GDP is the lowest among OECD countries at 6.3% of GDP, much lower than the OECD average of 9.3%. Median age in Turkey is 30 years compared to 43.9 average in EU countries. Aging population is the prime reason for higher healthcare expenditure in Europe. Life expectancy is 78.5 years, compared with the EU average of 81 years. Turkey has a high obesity rate, with 29.5% of its adult population obese.


## Coverage

Due to major health reforms in the 2000s and 2010s, universal health insurance coverage for the population was achieved, and the general quality of health services improved greatly, with patient satisfaction rising from 39.5% in 2003 to 75.9% in 2011.

The following medical treatments are covered by the SGK:

* Emergencies
* Work accidents and vocational illnesses
* Infectious diseases
* Preventive health services (substance use)
* Childbirth
* Extraordinary events (injuries from war and natural disasters)
* Fertility treatment for women younger than 39
* Cosmetic surgery deemed medically necessary

While some SGK-contracted hospitals offer dental care, in most cases, patients must rely on private dental services and are responsible for covering the costs. In addition, patients must partially cover the cost of some prescription drugs and outpatient services.
