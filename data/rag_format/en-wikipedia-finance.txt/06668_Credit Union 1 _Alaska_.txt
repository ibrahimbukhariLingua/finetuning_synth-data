## History

Credit Union 1 was established as the *Anchorage Teachers Federal Credit Union* in 1952. Its original membership base was personnel and dependents of the Anchorage Independent School District. The credit union has since merged with other Alaskan credit unions, such as FedAlaska, Ward Cove, Frontier Alaskan and North Country Credit Union, to form Credit Union 1.

In 2010, the credit union opened a branch in the Mountain View neighborhood of Anchorage, which had not had a financial institution for over 20 years. The land for the new branch was purchased from the Anchorage Community Land Trust.

In 2016, Credit Union 1 was named to *The Financial Brand’s* “Top 100" list of credit unions using social media.

In 2022, the credit union was again recognized as one of the top 49 businesses in Alaska by *Alaska Business Monthly*

In 2022, Credit Union 1 was again named among the top three Best Places to Work (250+ employees) in Alaska by *Alaska Business Monthly*
