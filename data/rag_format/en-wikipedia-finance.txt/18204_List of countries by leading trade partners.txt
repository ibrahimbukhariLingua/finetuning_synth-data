For most economies worldwide, their leading export and import trading partners in terms of value are typically the United States, the European Union (EU) or China. Emerging markets such as Russia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Turkey, and Iran are becoming increasingly important as major markets or source countries in various regions.

For individual EU member states, intra-EU trade is collectively greater than trade with any other partner. Both the EU and the United States have China as their largest source of imports. Conversely, the EU is China's largest source of imports. While the EU and the United States dominate as the largest trading partners in many parts of the world, other countries such as Brazil, Russia, and South Africa are gaining prominence within their respective regions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Some countries, especially isolated ones, heavily rely on a larger neighbouring country for trade. For instance, Venezuela is a key export market for Cuba, while Uzbekistan, being doubly-landlocked, primarily exports to its singly-landlocked neighbours, Tajikistan and Afghanistan.

The largest import and export merchandise trade partners for most countries of the world are listed below. Details for the European Union, Hong Kong and Macau are also included. In most cases the data relates to 2021 rankings. Data was extracted from the World Trade Organization's Trade Profile Database.
