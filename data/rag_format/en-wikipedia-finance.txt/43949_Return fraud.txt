Return fraud


# Return fraud



**Return fraud** is the act of defrauding a retail store by means of the return process. There are various ways in which this crime is committed. For example, the offender may return stolen merchandise to secure cash, steal receipts or receipt tape to enable a falsified return, or use somebody else's receipt to try to return an item picked up from a store shelf.

Return fraud and theft have been reported to lead to price increases for shoppers. Some stores create strict return policies such as "no receipt, no return" or impose return time restrictions.


## Types

Some examples of return fraud include:

* Bricking: Purchasing a working electronic item, deliberately damaging or stripping it of valuable components to render it unusable, then returning the item for profit.
* Cross-retailer return: Returning or exchanging an item purchased at another retailer (usually at a lower price) for cash, store credit, or a similar, higher-priced item at another retailer.
* Employee fraud: Assistance from employees to return stolen goods for full retail price.
* Open-box fraud: Purchasing an item from a store and returning it opened with the intent to re-purchase it at a lower price under the store's open-box policies. A variation of price-switching.
* Price arbitrage: Purchasing differently priced, but similar-looking merchandise and returning the cheaper item as the expensive one.
* Price switching: Placing higher-priced labels on merchandise with the intention of returning the item(s) at a higher price than purchase.
* Receipt fraud: Utilizing reused, stolen, or falsified receipts to return merchandise for profit.
* Returning stolen merchandise: Shoplifting with the objective to return the item(s) for full price, plus any sales tax.
* Switch fraud: Purchasing a working item, and returning a damaged or defective identical item that was already owned.

Return policies have historically served as the primary way for retailers to combat return fraud and abuse; the challenge is keeping policies from being overly restrictive or inconsistently interpreted, both of which may discourage loyal customers and affect purchases. Automated solutions have also been developed to help combat return fraud and abuse, including software programs that detect such behavior and help retailers determine whether a return is valid.


## Wardrobing

Wardrobing, purchasing merchandise for short-term use with the intent to return the item, has been described by industry advocates as a form of return fraud. Wardrobing is a form of return fraud where an item is purchased, used, and then returned to the store for a refund.

Wardrobing is most often done with expensive clothing, hence the name. Customers purchase the expensive clothe, wear it with the price tags and if necessary the ink tag, but then return the used item demanding a product return refund of some sort. This type of retail fraud is a social phenomenon, for example when summer vacations necessitate stylish outfits. However, this type of return fraud is also common with tools, electronics, and even computers. To prevent this practice, some stores make certain items, such as wedding dresses or Christmas decorations, unreturnable. Some observers classify wardrobing as a form of shoplifting.
