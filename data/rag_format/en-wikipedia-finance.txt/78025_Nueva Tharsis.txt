Nueva Tharsis


# Nueva Tharsis



**Nueva Tharsis** is a Spanish mining company based in the town of Tharsis, Huelva, Spain. It is the heir of several of the companies that have been exploiting the deposits of the Tharsis-La Zarza mining basin since the second half of the 19th century.


## History

Nueva Tharsis was created in 1996 as a labor corporation by the workers of Compañía Española de Minas de Tharsis to take over its assets and facilities. Initially, the company aimed to maintain the business of the previous company, although the economic context was not favorable due to the low pyrite prices in the market. In 1999 the FESA-Fertiberia plant announced that it would not renew the mineral purchase contract with Tharsis, which sentenced the activity of the deposits. As a result, the Tharsis railroad and the main facilities in the area were closed to traffic. In view of the poor state of Nueva Tharsis' finances, in 2002 the company proposed the auction of the mining and railway assets, although this eventuality did not materialize in the end. In fact, the company would end up collaborating with public institutions in the conservation and recovery of the railway heritage.

Nueva Tharsis has subsequently reconstituted itself as a public limited company and has taken part in various mining initiatives. In 2018 it was acquired by the Andalusian company Magtel, as part of its foray into the mining sector. Nueva Tharsis, owner of the exploitation rights of the Tharsis and La Zarza deposits, became a shareholder in the company "Tharsis Mining & Metallurgy". There are currently several projects aimed at reopening the mining operations in the area.
