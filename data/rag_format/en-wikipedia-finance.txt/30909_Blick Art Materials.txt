## History

Dick Blick and his wife Grace started **Dick Blick Company** in 1911, working from their kitchen to sell their first product, the Payzant pen, by mail order. Robert Metzenberg purchased the company in 1947. Its parent company is Dick Blick Holdings, Inc., founded by Blick and Metzenberg. Metzenberg expanded the company, opening mail order offices in Las Vegas, Nevada; Hartford, Connecticut; and Allentown, Pennsylvania. He opened the first Blick retail store in Galesburg, Illinois, in 1974. He also established retail outlets in Las Vegas, Allentown, and Dearborn, Michigan. Metzenberg's grandson, Robert Buchsbaum, became CEO in 1996. The Business Committee for the Arts, a division of Americans for the Arts, honored Buchsbaum with its 2016 Leadership Award, for "extraordinary vision, leadership, and commitment to supporting the arts and for encouraging other businesses to follow their lead."
