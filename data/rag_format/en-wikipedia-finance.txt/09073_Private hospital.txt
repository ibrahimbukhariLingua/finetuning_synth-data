Private hospital


# Private hospital



A **private hospital** is a hospital not owned by the government, including for-profit and non-profit hospitals. Funding is by patients themselves ("self-pay"), by insurers, or by foreign embassies. Private hospitals are commonly part, albeit in varying degrees, of the majority of healthcare systems around the world.


## United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom private hospitals are distinguished from National Health Service (NHS) institutions. However, many National Health Service hospitals provide some privately funded care in Private Patient Units (PPUs), and are included as private hospitals for competition law purposes. As of December 2018, there were an estimated 556 hospitals with over 9,000 beds providing privately funded care in the UK, in addition to many more private clinics providing outpatient services. Around 812,000 privately funded admissions occurred in 2017, comprising same-day treatment ("day-case") or overnight stays ("inpatient"). Of these, 714,000 took place in independent hospitals, and 97,000 in NHS facilities. Additionally, some 546,000 NHS-funded admissions were conducted at independent (private) hospitals. Privately funded care, and private hospitals, are most prevalent in London and the South East of England. In 1979 there were about 4,000 beds in UK private hospitals
