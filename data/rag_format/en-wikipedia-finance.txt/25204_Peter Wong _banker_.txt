In 2020, in a highly symbolic act that ended the bank's previous political neutrality, Wong signed a public petition supporting the Chinese leadership's creation of a far-reaching national security law for Hong Kong. The move was understood as politically necessary to avoid punitive action against the bank by Beijing but drew widespread international and local Hong Kong criticism.
