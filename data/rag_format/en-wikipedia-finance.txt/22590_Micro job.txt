Micro job


# Micro job



A **micro job** is a small paid freelance task selected from a centralized platform. The practice of working micro jobs is called **microemployment**, and people doing micro jobs are called **microemployees**.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ These jobs can be online or in-person: for example, acting as a virtual assistant, handyman, or nanny; or doing website design, dog boarding, or errands. Personal income varies depending on the jobs taken and the fee charged by the platform offering the jobs.

The concept is related to that of the gig economy. The micro-job industry is part of a larger movement of companies facilitating the outsourcing of products: for example AirBNB, which lets users independently rent out houses. Microemployment sites are growing rapidly as of 2013ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ and form a new type on-demand income for workers. These platforms can sometimes earn billions of dollars.


## Differences from traditional jobs

Most micro jobs do not pay benefits. Workers also cannot rely on a steady paycheck.


## In law

Microemployees are classified as independent contractors under the law, meaning they are not considered employees of the companies they work for. As independent contractors, they bear full legal responsibility for their actions and compliance with applicable regulations. The law is murky, however, on the relationship between microemployees and marketplaces where workers find jobs. Lawsuits are expected to test this connection. In January 2014 the Kuang-Liu family, of San Francisco, CA, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Uber and driver Syed Muzzafar. The accident, which caused the death of their 6-year-old daughter and injured two other family members, was allegedly caused while Muzzafar was fulfilling a driving job from Uber.

Individual auto insurance policies do not cover commercial activities, which may result in denials of claims if drivers are working for hire. To prevent legal complications, some ride service providers are requiring their drivers to purchase commercial insurance. Legislation for microemployment work issues remains unclear and unresolved.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
