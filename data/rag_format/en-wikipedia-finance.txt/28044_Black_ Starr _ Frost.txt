Black, Starr & Frost


# Black, Starr & Frost



**Black, Starr & Frost,** previously known as **Marquand and Co**, is an American jewelry company. Founded in 1810 as Marquand and Co., the company is the oldest continuously operating jewelry firm in the United States. The company has acted as a retailer, rather than manufacturer, for most of its history.


## History

**Marquand and Co.** was founded in 1804 by Connecticut silversmith Isaac Marquand. In 1820, Isaac's son Frederick moved to Savannah, Georgia with his cousin, Josiah Penfield, to open their own silversmith trade. However, the two left Savannah in 1824, with Frederick taking over the flourishing Marquand and Co. from his father. The company was headquartered at 166 Broadway, and over time became regarded as "the principal jewelers in the country," as stated in the obituary of Tiffany and Co. secretary Edward C. Moore.

Throughout their history, **Marquand and Co**. created silver products, including helmet-shaped gravy boats from 1833-39, as well as full-service tea sets. Frederick a, according to a contemporaneous article in the New York Times, was "the most prominent jeweler in the city." Many of their pieces are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as Savannah's Telfair Museums.

Henry Marquand, an original trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, briefly worked for the company before working on Wall Street in investment banking. Henry was the second President of the Metropolitan Museum, and bequeathed Old Master paintings to the collection.

Frederick Marquand, after serving as the President of Marquand and Company, sold the business in 1838 to former apprentices William Black and Henry Ball. The firm soon took the name Black, Ball, and Co. Frederick was later instrumental in the foundation of noted special collections institution Pequot Library.

In 1839, the company was purchased by Henry Ball, Erasmus Tompkins, and William Black, and renamed **Ball, Tompkins & Black** until 1851 when it became **Ball, Black & Company**. Under the latter name, the firm opened a store at the intersection of Broadway and Prince Street in New York City in 1860.

In 1876 it acquired its current name, **Black, Starr & Frost**, when new partners Cortlandt Starr and Aaron Frost joined the firm. In 1929 it merged with the Gorham Manufacturing Company to become **Black, Starr & Frost — Gorham**. They opened for business in a remodeled building at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street on October 30, 1929. The name was eventually styled as **Black Starr Frost Gorham**, but reverted to Black, Starr & Frost in 1960.
