ASB Business


# ASB Business



***ASB Business*** was a half-hour business news programme in New Zealand, with insights into issues affecting the business sector. It was broadcast on TV3 between 6.30am and 7.00am weekdays, followed by *Sunrise*.


## Format

Since 2 October 2007, *ASB Business* had been a main part of *Sunrise*, which was on air from 6:30 am. In an aim to attract more business viewers, particularly in Auckland, it was decided that from 6 October 2008 that a new 30-minute version of *ASB Business* would be produced. It was hosted by financial journalist Michael Wilson starting at 6:30 am. *Sunrise* moved to start at 7:00 am and featured regular business updates.

TV3 cancelled *ASB Business* on 8 April 2010, stating the show was financially unsustainable.

Note that previously *ASB Business* was the name of rival TVNZ's morning business programme on TV One at a similar timeslot. This programme is now titled *NZI Business*
