The NAPHIA is governed by a Board of Directors made up of appointed representatives from pet health insurance provider member companies.

## Role In politics

NAPHIA takes an active role in the law making process when pet insurance is involved. NAPHIA was heavily involved in California State Assembly bill AB2411, which would have required additional regulation for pet insurance in California, but was vetoed in late September 2010 by Governor Schwarzenegger.
