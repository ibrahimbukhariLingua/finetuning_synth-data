In 2011, the company received investments worth $250 million and became a founding member of the Indian Staffing Federation, an organization for India's Flexi staffing sector.

TeamLease established a partnership with the Government of Gujarat to set up a private university. This collaboration led to the establishment of TLSU as a university under the Gujarat Private Universities Act in 2013. Classes at the university commenced in 2014.
