Rail Land Development Authority


# Rail Land Development Authority



**Rail Land Development Authority** (RLDA) is a statutory authority, under the Indian Ministry of Railways, set-up by an Amendment to the Railways Act, 1989. It is responsible for creating assets for Indian Railways through the development of vacant railway land for commercial use to generate revenue by non-tariff measures. RLDA's mission is to be a leader in creating value through the redevelopment of land and air spaces – residential, commercial, and transportation hubs. RLDA's expenses are covered through grants provided by Indian Railways. RLDA transfers the total earnings generated from the development of railway land to Indian Railways. The Indian Planning Commission has computed an approximate budget of around Rs 20 to 272 billion for the development of infrastructure nationally during the 11th plan period. Out of this budget, the Railways has an anticipated requirement of Rs 2800 billion. 83% of this requirement is supposed to be met through public sector investment. In order to generate the remaining investment required to meet the budget mentioned above, the Indian Railways set up the Rail Land Development Authority on 1 November 2006. Manoj Garg, a 1992 batch IRSE officer, is Vice Chairman of RLDA. He joined RLDA on June 23, 2024, in a look-after charge capacity.

Currently, RLDA is working on four types of projects:

* Commercial Projects

The land which is not required for operational purposes in the foreseeable future will be identified by the zonal railways and the details will be advised to the Railway Board. Such plots of land would then be handed over to the RLDA by the Railway Board in phases for commercial development.
