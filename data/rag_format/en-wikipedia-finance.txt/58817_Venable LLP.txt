## History

Venable was founded in 1900 by law professor Richard Venable in Baltimore. It became the second-largest law firm in the Baltimore-Washington area in 1999 when it merged with Washington-based Tucker Flyer. The firm expanded cross country to Los Angeles in 2006.

In 2017, Venable headquarters moved to a new building in Washington, located at 600 Massachusetts Avenue.

In one of the largest law firm mergers of 2018, Venable acquired the New York intellectual property firm Fitzpatrick Cella, which had 100 attorneys at the time.

Venable opened a construction law office in Chicago in January 2021, with firm chairman Stu Ingis stating that the decision to expand was founded on Venable's "history of measured, strategic growth through the addition of talented attorneys and practices in markets that support client needs".

In *The American Lawyer AmLaw* 100 ranking for 2021, Venable was rated 59th in revenue per lawyer, 71st in profits per lawyer, 76th in profits per equity partner, and 73rd in all-partner compensation, for an overall ranking of 65th.

Shortly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Venable terminated its lobbying deal with Sberbank, Russia's largest bank. It was known that Sberbank had paid more than $800,000 to Venable for lobbying since 2017, according to Senate records.

In November 2022, Venable announced that it would merge with Genovese Joblove & Battista, a multi-practice Florida-based law firm with offices in Miami, Tampa, and Fort Lauderdale.
