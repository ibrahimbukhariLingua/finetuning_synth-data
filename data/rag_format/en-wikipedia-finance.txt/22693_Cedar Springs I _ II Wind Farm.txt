## Economic and environmental impact

The construction of the wind farm created approximately 400 jobs during development, including 40 positions filled by displaced oil and gas workers. The project is expected to provide over $100 million in tax revenue over its lifetime, funding local schools and public services. The wind farm generates enough energy to power approximately 120,000 homes annually.


## Project overview

The complex consists of three phases:

* Cedar Springs I: 199.4 MW (72 turbines)
* Cedar Springs II: 198.88 MW (72 turbines)
* Cedar Springs III: 133.28 MW (48 turbines)

## Turbine specifications

The wind farm employs two types of GE turbines across its three phases:

**Cedar Springs I & II:**

* GE 2.8-127: 89 m hub height, 127 m rotor diameter
* GE 2.3-116: 80 m hub height, 116 m rotor diameter

**Cedar Springs III:**

* 44 × GE Energy 2.8-127 (124.08 MW total)
* 4 × GE Energy 2.3-116 (9.2 MW total)

## Location

The wind farm is located approximately 50 miles northeast of Casper and about 30 miles northwest of Douglas.

The three phases are located in Converse County:

* Cedar Springs I: 43°04′45″N 105°27′02″W﻿ / ﻿43.07917°N 105.45056°W﻿ / 43.07917; -105.45056
* Cedar Springs II: 42°57′02″N 105°21′15″W﻿ / ﻿42.95056°N 105.35417°W﻿ / 42.95056; -105.35417
* Cedar Springs III: 43°06′44″N 105°31′06″W﻿ / ﻿43.11222°N 105.51833°W﻿ / 43.11222; -105.51833

## Development and construction

The project was developed by Cedar Springs Transmission and Orion Wind Resources, with Blattner Energy handling construction. All three phases were completed in 2020.
Construction began in spring 2020, with turbine installation starting in May. The project employed both local contractors and materials where possible, contributing to the local economy through accommodation, fuel, and other local services. The construction was completed on schedule by December 2020, transitioning to a permanent staff of 20 full-time employees.


## Power purchase agreement

The power generated from Cedar Springs I is sold to PacifiCorp under a power purchase agreement for 200 MW, starting in 2020.


## Economic and environmental impact

The construction of the wind farm created hundreds of jobs and is projected to provide millions in tax revenue over its operational lifespan. It generates enough energy to power approximately 120,000 homes annually.


## Workplace safety

On August 5, 2024, an accident occurred at the Cedar Springs wind energy construction site. A crane toppled, resulting in the death of a 55-year-old crane operator, John William Hoffpauir, Jr., of Louisiana. The incident is under investigation by Wyoming OSHA.
