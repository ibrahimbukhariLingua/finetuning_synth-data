### P.F. Chang's

In 2017, after completing his MBA at Harvard Business School, Damola joined Paulson & Co. an investment firm founded by hedge fund billionaire John Paulson. During his time at Paulson & Co, P.F. Chang’s was put up for sale, Damola pitched the investment idea to Paulson, which led to the 2019 deal that made Paulson & Co. and TriArtisan Capital Advisors acquired a controlling stake in P.F.

In 2023 Damola stepped down as CEO of P.F. Chang’s after four years in the role but remained involved with the brand’s private equity owners.


### Red Lobster

In 2024 the Orlando, Florida-based seafood chain Red Lobster slipped towards bankruptcy closing 93 locations and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 20, 2024, with over $1 billion in debt. On June 14, 2024 it was reported that Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street investment firm co-founded by Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens was interested in acquisition of the company.

On August 26, 2024, Fortress appointed Damola CEO of Red Lobster Investor Holdings LLC, making him the sixth and youngest CEO in the company’s history. Damola, in a 2024 conversation with CNN reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn, stated that he wanted to lead Red Lobster’s turnaround because of its history as the “first really successful casual dining chain in America at scale.” and his approach to Red Lobster’s recovery would focus on incremental changes rather than a complete overhaul.
