Sporting goods retailer


# Sporting goods retailer



A **sporting goods retailer** or **sporting goods store** is a retail business selling sporting and recreational goods, including sportswear, sporting equipment and related general merchandise.


## History

Decathlon, the world's largest sporting good retail chain, opened its first store in Lille, France, in 1976. It now has about 1700 stores in 60 countries and territories.

The sector contracted globally in 2007 and 2008, due to the loss of disposable income during the Global Financial Crisis.

The sector contacted again in 2020, outside China, due to restrictions on outdoor and team sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many brands, retailers, and manufacturers failed to return a profit, and many households reduced physical activity due to reduced disposable income. However, demand for sportwear and indoor fitness equipment remained high. The sector experienced significant growth in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic.

In 2021, McKinsey & Company identified a shift away from conventional bricks and mortar retail to online shops requiring more agile supply chains and experiential retail offering unique experiences. In the United States, Dick's Sporting Goods began trialling concept stores with specialties, or in-store experiences like golf putting green, wellness experts, yoga classes, rock climbing, batting cages, and equipment repair services.

In the same report, McKinsey & Company also identified a strong market for sportswear, which was becoming both more lucrative and more competitive. This was partly due to the blurring of lines between active wear and casual wear.

Also in 2021, Mintel has identified three potential growth areas: women's sporting goods; men's sportswear; and the marketing of premium brands, particularly to parents.

In 2022, research in the United States found consumers were planning to spend less at sporting goods retailers due to rising costs of living and other prices.
