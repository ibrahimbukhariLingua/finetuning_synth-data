On November 23, 2022, the Investigation Police Agency of Khanh Hoa Provincial Police Department officially prosecuted four individuals who used to work at Sacombank - Cam Ranh City Branch. The four former employees of Sacombank Transaction Office were accused of borrowing money from outside and from customers in their personal capacity. The incident was discovered when customers came to withdraw money at Sacombank Cam Ranh Branch. These customers then filed a complaint with the investigating agency. According to a source, the total amount of money that the four employees of Sacombank Cam Ranh branch borrowed from people was up to more than 100 billion VND.

Sacombank has decided to dismiss these employees and appoint new ones to ensure the stable operation of Cam Ranh Transaction Office.
