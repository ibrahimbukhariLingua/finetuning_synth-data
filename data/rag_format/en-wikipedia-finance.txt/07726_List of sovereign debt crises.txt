List of sovereign debt crises


# List of sovereign debt crises



The **list of sovereign debt crises** involves the inability of independent countries to meet its liabilities as they become due. These include:

* A sovereign default, where a government suspends debt repayments
* A debt restructuring plan, where the government agrees with other countries, or unilaterally reduces its debt repayments
* Requiring assistance from the International Monetary Fund or another international source

Debts could be owed either to private parties within a country, to foreign investors, or to other countries.

The following table includes actual sovereign defaults and debt restructuring of independent countries since 1557.
