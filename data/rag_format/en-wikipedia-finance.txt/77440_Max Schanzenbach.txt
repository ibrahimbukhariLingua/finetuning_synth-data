## Work

A 2007 study co-authored by Schanzenbach and Robert H. Sitkoff argued that trustees responded appropriately to the introduction of so-called prudent investor laws. Also in 2007, Schanzenbach and Emerson Tiller (who is also a professor at Northwestern) co-authored a study showing that judges appointed by Republicans tend to give harsher sentences for street crime, while those appointed by Democrats tend to punish white-collar criminals more severely. Schanzenbach has also argued that police union contracts are serious impediments to creating incentives for proper police conduct, including the contract made by the union representing officers in the Chicago Police Department.
