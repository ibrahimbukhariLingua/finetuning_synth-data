## History

GBG was established in 1989 initially as GB Mailing Systems, to exploit the market for postcode and address information. In addition to software products, GB Mailing Systems also provided bureau services relating to postcodes, names, addresses and other information. In the late 1990s the company changed its name to GB Information Management and in July 1999, was acquired by Phonelink, a company founded by Trevor Burke. At the time of acquisition, GB Information Management had a turnover of 6.9 million GBP, an operating profit of 1 million GBP and employed approximately 80 people in Chester, United Kingdom.

On 1 April 2000, the company changed its name from Phonelink Plc to TelMe.com Plc. In February 2004, the company changed its name to GB Group as part of a movement to distinguish itself from its previous travel interests. In 2006 the company launched an international identity verification service covering 21 countries. In 2011 GB Group moved to a listing on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market. In 2015 GB Group re-branded to "GBG" for ease of international recognition. This reflected a desire to pursue international growth. In 2019 GBG international revenues increased to represent 57% of revenues from 35%.
