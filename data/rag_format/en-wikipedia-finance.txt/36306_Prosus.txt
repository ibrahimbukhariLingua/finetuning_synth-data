Prosus is best known for its investments in Tencent, dating back to a 45% share in 2001. In 2019 the company attempted to acquire Just Eat, but lost the bidding war to Takeaway.com.

In March 2022, Prosus announced it was writing off its 25.9% stake (worth approximately US$700m) in social media company VK after VK's CEO Vladimir Kirienko was put on a U.S. sanctions list.


## Controversy

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many international companies, particularly Western, pulled out of Russia. Unlike most of its Western competitors, Prosus was slow to announce any disinvestments or scaling back of its operations in Russia. It was criticised in particular with regard to its Avito platform (a subsidiary of OLX), which, among other activities, provided classified advertising services that were used by the Russian army for recruiting purposes. In October 2022, Prosus agreed to sell Avito service to Kismet Capital Group for $2.4 bln.
