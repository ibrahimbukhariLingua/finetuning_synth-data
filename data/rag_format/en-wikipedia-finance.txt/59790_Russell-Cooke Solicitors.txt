The firm has a core client base of more than 12,000 and an annual turnover of £32.6 million.

## History

Russell-Cooke was founded in London in 1880 by William Russell Cooke and Sir Henry Paget-Cooke.

In the 1890s the firm moved into Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, where clients included the Liberal Party and members of the Royal Family.

Following the Second World War, Russell-Cooke aligned itself with Sloper, Potter & Chapman, which was based in South West London. The two firms eventually merged in 1958 to form Russell-Cooke Potter & Chapman, with Edward Chapman as senior partner.

During the 1960s and 1970s Russell-Cooke Potter and Chapman expanded, developing a large commercial property department and attracted a number of famous clients from the pop and entertainment world. Edward Chapman's son Lewin became senior partner.

A third office in Kingston-upon-Thames was opened on the Thames at Kingston Bridge. After 100 years occupying the upper two floors of 2 Putney Hill, the firm took over the ground floor from the National Westminster Bank. Further growth during the nineties saw the Central London contingent move from Old Square into grade 2 listed buildings at 8 Bedford Row. Expansion in the last ten years sees the firm occupying a customised modern building of around 35,000 sq ft in Putney on a site it has occupied for more than 100 years.

The firm shortened its name to Russell-Cooke in 2001. In May 2007 the firm converted to a limited liability partnership [LLP] practice, Russell-Cooke LLP.

The firm is an all-equity partnership and has an unusually high proportion of female partners for at least the last 15 years. A majority of the firm's Board are women including the joint managing partner.

Environmental policies have included a large solar array installed in 2013 and bee hives set up in 2014. It became a "carbon negative" business in 2019. Very unusually for a large firm, it has long had a strategic target to maintain 5% of its turnover for legally aided work.
