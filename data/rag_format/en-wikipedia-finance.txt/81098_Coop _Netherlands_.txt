Coop (Netherlands)


# Coop (Netherlands)



**Coop Supermarkten** is a supermarket chain founded in 1891 in Zaandam, Netherlands. It is named after the cooperative aspects of the company. In 2001, the company merged with wholesale purchaser Codis to form CoopCodis. In 2009, the name was changed again, from CoopCodis to Coop Supermarkten. Coop Supermarkten takes part in the Dutch wholesale purchasing cooperative Superunie.

In the last few years, the company launched a new type of store called Supercoop: these large stores are placed in areas where there is usually a lot of competition from other chains and they are seen as a response to the Dutch price war among supermarkets ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ. With these new stores, the colours that the chain used were gradually changed from red and blue to orange, red and grey. The (new) logo is the store brand (Coop, Supercoop, or CoopCompact) in orange with a big red striking arc under it.

Their market share in 2013 was around 2.8 percent.

The company has a customer loyalty card, called "Coop Klantenkaart" in Dutch.

On 6 September 2021 it was announced the supermarket chains PLUS and Coop have reached an agreement on a merger. The stores will continue under the name Plus, the name Coop will disappear. The combined organization is expected to become operational early next year.
