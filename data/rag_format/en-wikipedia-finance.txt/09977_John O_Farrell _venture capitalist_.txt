From 2001 to 2007, O’Farrell was executive vice president, business development, for Opsware Inc., which was initially known as Loudcloud and was one of the first companies to offer Software as a Service and cloud computing services. With CEO Ben Horowitz, O’Farrell negotiated Loudcloud's 2002 exit from the services business and its emergence as a server automation software company named Opsware with a $52 million initial contract from EDS. Over the subsequent five years, O’Farrell led the expansion of Opsware's product line into asset-management, networking, storage and runbook automation through four acquisitions as well as overseas partnerships with NEC Corp. and NTT Communications. In February 2006, O’Farrell negotiated Opsware's multi-million dollar distribution agreement with Cisco Systems, which was generating $5 million in quarterly revenue for Cisco by Q4 of that year. O’Farrell and Horowitz orchestrated a process involving 10 potential acquirers that resulted in the sale of Opsware to Hewlett-Packard for $1.65 billion in June 2007.

O’Farrell joined smart grid networking company Silver Spring Networks in January 2008 as executive vice president, business development. O’Farrell led the company's $90 million Series D fundraising led by Kleiner Perkins and Google; its expansion into Europe, Latin America and Asia; and its acquisition of Greenbox Technology.

He became the first non-founding partner of Andreessen Horowitz in 2010, and according to the *Irish Times*, he "quietly [rose] to become one of Ireland’s most senior figures in the technology world." In 2013, he moved out of investing and into an advisory role. In 2019, he became a board member at Slack, although without board voting rights, prior to its acquisition.
