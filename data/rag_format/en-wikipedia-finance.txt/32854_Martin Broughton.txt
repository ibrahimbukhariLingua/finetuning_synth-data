## British Airways chairman

Sir Martin joined the British Airways board as a non-executive director in May 2000 became the deputy chairman in November 2003, and became chairman in July 2004, serving until 2013.


## Liverpool F.C. chairman

On 16 April 2010, Liverpool F.C. appointed Martin Broughton to be their new chairman, despite the fact that he is a lifelong Chelsea supporter. Broughton was tasked with expediting the sale of the club to new owners.

On 6 October 2010, it was announced that Liverpool F.C. was to be sold to New England Sports Ventures (NESV) for £300 million; significantly lower than the amount being requested by the club's then owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Broughton and the rest of the Liverpool F.C. board won the right to sell the club in a High Court case against Hicks and Gillett on 13 October 2010. The ruling was described by the fans' group Kop Faithful as "It's like a huge cloud has been lifted off us.....Hicks and Gillett leave with no legacy, apart from one of chaos". Broughton was succeeded as Liverpool F.C. chairman by Tom Werner after the takeover was completed by NESV.


## Tote Bid

In 2009, he spearheaded a private equity bid to buy The Tote as part of the government's privatisation process. The bid was made through an investment vehicle called Sports Investment Partners, with which his son Michael is also involved. The bid was one of five that successfully passed the first round of the process in January 2011.


## Chelsea FC bid

In 2022, he, along with Lewis Hamilton and Serena Williams, was involved in a bid to purchase Chelsea F.C. with global investment firm Centricus.
