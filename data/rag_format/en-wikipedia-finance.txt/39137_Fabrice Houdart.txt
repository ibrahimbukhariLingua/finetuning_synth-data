## World Bank Controversy

During budget cuts in 2014, Houdart objected to a $94,000 bonus awarded to the World Bank's Chief Financial Officer, Bertrand Badré. This led to tensions with the Bank's leadership and President Jim Yong Kim. This situation escalated when Houdart was investigated and demoted following accusations of leaking official-use-only documents as part of his activism on SOGI and development. The allegations, which Houdart contested, were seen by some as retaliatory for his whistleblowing actions. Houdart resigned from the Bank in 2016 to join the United Nations describing the previous years as an ordeal.
