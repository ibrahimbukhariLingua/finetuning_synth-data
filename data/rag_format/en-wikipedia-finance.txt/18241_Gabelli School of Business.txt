Gabelli School of Business


# Gabelli School of Business



The **Gabelli School of Business** is the undergraduate and graduate business school of Fordham University, a private Jesuit research university in New York City, New York.

Fordham University's involvement in business started early in the 20th century with the founding of the School of Business in 1920. The Gabelli School of Business has been an AACSB-accredited business school for over 50 years, and is a partner of the CFA Institute. As of March 2015, it incorporated the former **Fordham Graduate School of Business**.


## History

The Gabelli School of Business was established in 1920 in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, and is now located on Fordham's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx as well as on the Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan. Fordham established itself as a provider of graduate business education in 1969, with the launch of its first master's degree programs at the Lincoln Center campus. The undergraduate and graduate business schools were separate entities until 2001 when the University administration made the decision to unify them under one Dean until 2005 when they were again put under separate leadership. In 2014 the University administration began a yearlong process of unifying them again with a single identity and one dean.

The Graduate School of Business opened in 1969 as part of the redevelopment of Lincoln Center. The Graduate School of Business was part of a consortium offering an MBA at Peking University in Beijing China from 1998-2008 and was replaced by Vlerick University. This program, known as BiMBA (Beijing international MBA), was listed by Forbes Magazine as one of the most valuable Chinese programs.


## Campus

The school is housed across two campuses: in Hughes Hall on the Rose Hill campus, and at Lincoln Center, in the former Law School building and at 45 Columbus Avenue (former College Board headquarters in Manhattan bought by Fordham in 2014, that is located right across the street from the former Law School building). The former Law School building reopened as the "140 W. 62nd St." building of the Lincoln Center campus in Summer 2016. It is primarily the building for the Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center, but it is shared with the Quinn Library, student clubs offices, Argo Tea, Health Services, Student Leadership, Multicultural Affairs and Counseling.
