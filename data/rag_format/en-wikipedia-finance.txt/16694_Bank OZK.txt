## History

Bank OZK began as a community bank in Jasper, Arkansas in 1903, expanding to a second location in Ozark, Arkansas in 1937.

In 1979, when the bank had 2 branches and $28 million in assets, George Gleason, a 25-year-old lawyer at the Rose Law Firm, bought the bank changed its name to Bank of the Ozarks.

In 1994, the bank had five locations but began expanding. The headquarters was moved to Little Rock in 1995.

In December 2008, the bank moved into a 92,000-square-foot four-story headquarters; in 2018 it began construction on a new 180,000 square foot headquarters at a $98 million cost.

In 2018, the name of the bank was changed to Bank OZK to reflect its expansion from the Ozarks.
