Ballmer Group


# Ballmer Group



**Ballmer Group** is an American investment company based in Bellevue, Washington, that serves as a family office to manage the wealth of Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft. The purpose of Ballmer Group is to help children, especially those born into poor families, with economic mobility.

Ballmer Group has a presence in southeast Michigan, Washington state, and Los Angeles County.


## Background

After retiring from his role at Microsoft, Steve Ballmer decided to join his wife, Connie, in philanthropy, and the two co-founded the Ballmer Group in 2015.

At the start of his philanthropic work, Ballmer wanted to understand how much the government was actually helping disadvantaged children and set up Ballmer Group to help children, especially those from the lowest economic strata move up economically. The company focuses on funding organizations that demonstrate the ability to reduce systemic inequities. It also provides grants to direct services to strengthen communities. Grants typically last for at least three years and the use of them are unrestricted. However, before providing funding or grants, the Ballmer Group will perform significant data-based due diligence on the organizations as well as tracking their commitment and ability to deliver.

Ballmer Group has also been involved in backing advocacy groups related to policies on criminal justice issues including bail reform and expunging criminal records. It also has regularly spoken with lawmakers and legislators such as Karen Bass.

With regards to its approach in funding education programs, Ballmer Group uses a "wraparound approach", which emphasizes the community context rather than being directly involved with educational issues such as K-12 personalized learning, academic standards and curriculum. One of its largest donations was made to StriveTogether, a network of local communities striving to achieve racial equity and economic mobility for children.

Ballmer Group is structured as a limited liability company which gives the Ballmers more options on what it can do. The company has been noted having less transparency than other peers. Officials from the Ballmer Group have told *Education Week,* they would not commit to publicly disclose all the organization's grants, investments, lobbying work, or support for elected officials and campaigns.

In 2016, Ballmer Group expanded its operations into the Los Angeles County. In 2017, it expanded its operations into Detroit.
