2010 Australian federal budget


# 2010 Australian federal budget



The **2010 Australian federal budget** for the Australian financial year ended 30 June 2011 was presented on 11 May 2010 by the Treasurer of Australia, Wayne Swan, the third federal budget presented by Swan, and the third and final budget of the first Rudd government.

The budget forecast a return to surplus in 2012–13. Projections were based on a successful passing of the Resource Super Profits Tax based on a 40% of mining company profits.

The budget featured changes to regulation regarding savings from 1 July 2011. Tax will only have to be paid on half of the total interest earned so as to encourage people to save. There were changes to the way millions of Australians do their tax returns by decreasing their reliance on tax agents. Sport in Australia received a "significant" funding boost. The budget was the first ever to be released under a Creative Commons license.


## Forecasts


### Deficit

The deficit for the 2010–2011 financial year was expected to be A$40.8 billion or 2.9% of gross domestic product.


## Revenue mix

The total revenue was $309.9 billion.


### Taxation

The Resource Super Profits tax (RSPT) was expected to generate $3 billion in revenue in 2011–12. However Julia Gillard replaced the RSPT with the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT). The new tax was expected to generate $10.5 billion in revenue during its first two years of operation beginning in 2012. By increasing the taxation on mining super profits the company taxation rate can be dropped to 29% in 2013–14 and 28% in 2014–15.

Those able to save will receive a 50% tax discount on the first $1,000 of interest earned on their deposits.

## Opposition and crossbench response

Opposition Leader Tony Abbott focused his attack on the mining industry tax, indicating he would rescind the tax if elected. Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey claimed the budget was "based on false assumptions". Hockey suggested the budget was too reliant on a "great big new tax" and lacked any serious reform.


## Reception

The election year budget was described as an exercise in restraint that contained few surprises. The budget was faulted because it relies on strong terms of trade, demand from Asia, in particular China and a global recovery. It was praised by health and financial services sectors. The Australian Medical Association welcomed the extra funding for health. Catholic Health Australia reacted positively to the measures aimed at training and retaining medical and aged care staff.

The Business Council of Australia was disappointed the MRRT would be used to return to surplus.
