## Political career


### Party of Free Citizens

Having previously been chair of the Young Conservatives, the youth wing of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mach left ODS at the end of 2007 after the party moved to a position of support for the Treaty of Lisbon. He established a new party, the Party of Free Citizens, in 2009, and was re-elected as party leader in 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015.

In September 2010, Mach addressed the UK Independence Party (UKIP) annual conference and praised Václav Klaus for his opposition to the Lisbon Treaty. He addressed the UKIP party conference again in 2014 following their victory in the European parliament election.


### Resignations and departure from politics

On 10 December 2016, Mach resigned as chair of the Party of Free Citizens due to disputes about party direction, but returned to the office and was re-elected party chairman on 22 January 2017.

Mach announced his resignation as a member of the European Parliament on 31 August 2017, stating that he wanted to fully concentrate on the parliamentary election campaign.

Mach resigned as party leader in October after poor results in the parliamentary election, and finished second behind Tomáš Pajonk in the subsequent leadership election. In 2018, Mach decided not to run for election again and announced his departure from politics.
