Paramount Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network, Inc.


# Paramount Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network, Inc.



In ***Paramount Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network, Inc.***, 637 A.2d 34 (Del. 1994), the Delaware Supreme Court clarified the type of transaction that triggers *Revlon* duties.


## Facts

This case, an appeal from a decision of the Delaware Chancery Court, involved a proposed merger between Viacom and Paramount Communications; as part of the merger agreement, Paramount agreed to an array of defensive measures, including a no-shop provision, $100 million termination fee and a lock-up option on approximately 20% of Paramountâ€™s common stock. However, QVC intervened with its own, facially more generous merger proposal, conditioned on cancellation of the defensive measures. The Paramount board refused to conduct a formal bidding process with QVC on the grounds that it would be inconsistent with its contractual obligations to Viacom.

The court found that,

> The sale of control in this case, which is at the heart of the proposed strategic alliance, implicates enhanced judicial scrutiny of the conduct of the Paramount Board under *Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co.,* Del. Supr., 493 A.2d 946 (1985), and *Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings, Inc.,* Del.Supr., 506 A.2d 173 (1986). (The "Revlon" decision.)
