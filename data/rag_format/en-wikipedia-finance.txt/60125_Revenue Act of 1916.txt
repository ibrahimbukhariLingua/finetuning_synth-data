Revenue Act of 1916


# Revenue Act of 1916



The United States **Revenue Act of 1916**, (ch. 463, 39 Stat. 756, September 8, 1916) raised the lowest income tax rate from 1% to 2% and raised the top rate to 15% on taxpayers with incomes above $2 million ($56 million in 2023 dollars). Previously, the top rate had been 7% on income above $500,000 ($14 million in 2023 dollars). The Act also instituted the federal estate tax.

The entry of the United States into World War I greatly increased the need for revenue.

An excess profits tax was introduced and the modern estate tax was imposed.

The act was applicable to incomes for 1916.
