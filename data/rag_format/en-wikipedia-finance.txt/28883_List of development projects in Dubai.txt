Construction on Palm Jebel Ali and The World Islands were expected to be resumed in 2010, however recommencement has been further delayed. Construction on other halted projects was thought likely to be resumed in 2011.


## Recovery from the Great Recession

A report published by *Forbes* on October 22, 2012, says Dubai recovered faster from the Great Recession faster than most other countries and now its economy is growing in a higher rate than its counterparts because of its zero tax policy and economic free zones. The estimated GDP growth rate of Dubai in 2012 was 4.5%. The growth was mainly driven by the tourism, commerce and industrial manufacturing sectors.

According to the UAE's Ministry of Finance, Dubai's government has allocated 32.3 billion dirhams ($8.8 billion) for infrastructure projects in 2012, marking a return to big spending on such projects as some of these projects had been stalled due to lack of funding.

In November 2012, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced fifteen new projects worth more than $187 million. These projects are a part of the municipality's 2013 to 2015 strategic plan of Dubai.
