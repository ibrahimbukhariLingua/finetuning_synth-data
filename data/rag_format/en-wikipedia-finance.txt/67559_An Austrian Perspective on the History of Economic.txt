# An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought



***An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought*** is two-volume non-fiction work written by Murray N. Rothbard. Rothbard said he originally intended to write a "standard Adam Smith-to-the-present moderately sized book"; but expanded the scope of the project to include economists who preceded Smith and to comprise a multi-volume series. Rothbard completed only the first two volumes, *Economic Thought Before Adam Smith* and *Classical Economics*.
