# Louise Patten



**Louise Alexandra Virginia Charlotte Patten, Baroness Patten** (born 2 February 1954) is a British businesswoman and author, who is the wife of the Conservative politician John Patten and the granddaughter of the RMS Titanic Second Officer, Charles Lightoller.


## Background

Patten went to St Paul's Girls' School and then to Oxford University where she was a contemporary of Theresa May at St Hugh's College, Oxford. She married John Patten, Baron Patten in 1978 and has one daughter, Mary-Claire Patten.


## Business career

Patten is one of the few women who has held a senior position in British business. She states that "business is still organised for the majority, who are men" and this lifestyle is a major issue for women in business. During her career she has tended to choose companies that are family-friendly and has had a "portfolio career" - multiple part-time jobs at several companies.

She started work at Citibank in 1977. Four years later she moved to Wells Fargo Bank and then in 1985 became a partner in PA Consulting. In 1993 she left PA Consulting and became a non-executive director at the Hilton Group and at Harveys Furniture. She joined global strategy advisers Bain & Company Inc in 1993 where since 1997 she has been a Senior Adviser.

In 1998 she started as NED of Somerfield, a chain of small supermarkets. She rose to become chairman and stayed there until it was taken over by The Co-operative Group in March 2009.

In 2006 she started as a non-executive director of Marks & Spencer plc.
She was later the chairman of Brixton plc, a FTSE 250 property business. In 2003 she was nicknamed "Queen of the Sheds" and described "the most powerful woman in property" due to this role.

She was a non-executive director of Bradford & Bingley when the company failed and was nationalised in 2008. She has remained on the board and is now an NED of UK Asset Resolution, which combines the run-down mortgages of the former Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Novelist

She is the author of the novels *Bad Money*, a thriller based in the City of London, and *Good as Gold*, a historical novel about the Titanic disaster. In *Good as Gold* she said that the sinking had been caused by an error on the steering deck, due to confusion between competing systems of navigation orders.
