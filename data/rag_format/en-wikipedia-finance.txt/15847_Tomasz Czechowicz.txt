## Education

## Business ventures

Czechowicz began pursuing various business ventures from a young age. As a teenager, he coded, produced and sold computer accessories at the trade center in Wrocław, and later in Warsaw as well. When he moved to Wrocław to attend the university, he also began importing old and new computers to Poland, among them Commodore 64s, which made him one of the company's largest European customers.

In 1990 Tomasz Czechowicz, Janusz Krasnopolski and Tomasz Gomułkiewicz co-founded JTT Computer SA. The company continued importing Commodores. In 1997, the company reached a milestone agreement with Intel and Microsoft that allowed them to begin assembling their own PCs under the ADAX brand. Czechowicz was the company's CEO until 1998. During these eight years, he turned the company into the leading Central European PC assembly and distribution business, generating over $100 mln in revenue. In a 2006 interview Tomasz Czechowicz said his experience at this company played a significant role in shaping him and his future business ventures. In an interview from 2016, he commented that JTT Computer S.A. was one of his biggest business challenges, but also one which prepared him well for his next business endeavors.

In 1999, after leaving JTT Computer S.A., Czechowicz founded MCI Group, one of the leading private equity firms in Poland and in Europe, and has been its managing partner since.
