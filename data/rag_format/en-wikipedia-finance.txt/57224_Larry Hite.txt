## Early life

During college, Hite was a rock music promoter, as well as an occasional actor and screenwriter, but eventually became serious about staying in the music business. However, after several incidents, he decided to become a stockbroker in 1968.


## Career

In 1990, Jack Schwager dedicated a chapter of his bestselling book, Market Wizards, to Hite's trading and risk management philosophy. In the same year, Hite began adding systematic trading of equity markets to the Mint managed futures portfolio. During this time, he also formed a partnership with the Man Group and pioneered the principal protected fund concept, leading to a number of successful structured products and financial engineering innovations.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1994, he retired from his role as hands-on fund manager at Mint. Since that time he maintained the position of managing director of Hite Capital LLC.

In 2000, Hite chose to focus on his family office activities, which included proprietary trading and the funding of continued research and development in the field of systematic trading. Joined by former members of the original Mint team, Hite formed Hite Capital Management.

In that same year, Hite became a principal investor and Chairman of North America region of Metropolitan Venture Partners, a venture capital firm specializing in technology-based firms. He maintains that position to date.

As of 2010, Hite partnered with International Standard Asset Management (ISAM) to create a multi-strategy platform of liquid hedge fund strategies as well as a fund of managed accounts.


## Philanthropy

Hite founded his own charitable enterprise, The Hite Foundation, where he serves as chairman. The foundation began with a focus on alleviating homelessness in New York, and aids scholars whose work and lives are threatened in repressive societies.

He also serves as Chairman of the Development Committee for the Institute of International Education's Scholar Rescue Fund. The committee's goal is to provide a safe haven for academics and professionals who are at risk throughout the world.
