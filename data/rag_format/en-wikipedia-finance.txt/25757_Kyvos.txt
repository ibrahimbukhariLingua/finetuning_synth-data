# Kyvos



**Kyvos** is a business intelligence acceleration platform for cloud and big data platforms developed by an American privately held company named **Kyvos Insights**. The company, headquartered in Los Gatos, California, was founded by Praveen Kankariya. The software provides OLAP-based multidimensional analysis on big data and cloud platforms and was launched officially in June 2015.


## Technology

The software uses OLAP technology to enable business intelligence on the cloud and big data platforms. Kyvos was originally built for Hadoop and later on added support for Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Initially, it supported only MDX queries and integrated with data visualization tools such as Excel and Tableau. In 2017, Kyvos 4.0 added support for SQL connectivity extending integration to other BI tools such as Business Objects, Cognos, MicroStrategy, Power BI and Qlik.

In January 2021, MicroStrategy launched a new gateway connector for Kyvos with its latest version MicroStrategy 2021.
