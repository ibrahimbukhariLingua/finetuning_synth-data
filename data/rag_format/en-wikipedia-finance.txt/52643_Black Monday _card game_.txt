## Reception

Brian Walker reviewed *Black Monday* for *Games International* magazine, and gave it 3 stars out of 5, and stated that "The game is fun to play and quite skillful when played with three or four; any more and it's pretty random. Not one of Sid's best, though."

Paul Brady for *The Guardian* said "It is a simple card game, easy to pick up, but can be fast and furious when you have the knack."

Barry Ellis, writing in *The Game Report*, noted "Practically any game by Sid Sackson is a joy to play, as it invariably has simple rules yet ample opportunities abound for serious decision making and player interaction." Regarding *Black Monday*, Ellis admitted, "This is not one of his best efforts, but I'm currently finding it to be entertaining, and perhaps more importantly, I have no problem getting people to play it."
