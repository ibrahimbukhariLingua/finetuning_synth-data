Tracker Fund of Hong Kong


# Tracker Fund of Hong Kong



**Tracker Fund of Hong Kong** or **TraHK** is a unit trust which provides investment results that correspond to the performance of the Hang Seng Index in the Hong Kong stock market.


## History

In 1998, the Hong Kong SAR Government acquired a substantial portfolio of Hong Kong shares to sustain linked exchange rate during the Asian Financial Crisis. To minimise disruption to the market, the Government chose to launch the IPO of the exchange-traded fund, "the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong", in 1999 as the first step in its disposal programme.

State Street Global Advisors was appointed as the Fund Manager and State Street Bank and Trust Company was appointed as the Trustee of TraHK. These appointments provided the Tracker Fund with a comprehensive solution to its needs, including portfolio management, custody, fund administration and compliance monitoring functions.

With an issue size of HK$33.3 billion (approximately US$4.3 billion), TraHK's initial public offering (IPO) was the largest IPO ever in Asia except Japan at the time of launch. Since the IPO, approximately HK$140.4 billion (by 15 October 2002) in Hang Seng Index constituent stocks has been returned to the market through TraHK's unique tap mechanism.

In March 2022, Hang Seng Investment Management replaced State Street Global Advisors as manager of the TraHK.
