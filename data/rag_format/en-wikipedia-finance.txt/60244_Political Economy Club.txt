Political Economy Club


# Political Economy Club



The **Political Economy Club** is the world's oldest economics association that was founded by James Mill. It was founded in 1821 in London with David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, and Robert Torrens, because there were not any professional associations for free trade economists to peer-review their work. Despite Mill's exclusive limit to 30 members: the Political Economy Club was a
predominant influence on 19th century economics.


## History

On 18 April 1821, Swinton Holand held at his house the first meeting of the Club. A second larger meeting was held at Freemasons' Tavern, London, on 30 April. The club now meets monthly at Brooks's Club to hear the members' papers and dine.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The founding participants' disagreement on the formulation of their fundamental axioms provoked Ricardo to privately express his infamous assertion of the 'non-existence of any measure of absolute value'. There were subsequently founded the less exclusive Section F of the BAAS (founded 1832), and the Statistical Society of London (founded 1834), and the Cobden Club (founded 1866), and the British Economic Association (founded 1890).

## Bicentenary Essay Competition

To celebrate the PEC's bicentennial, an open international essay competition was announced in 2020 for the 2021 year. Candidates were asked to choose one of two titles. These were:

1. "How relevant are the ideas of Malthus and Ricardo respectively to today’s issues of climate change (is this an example of Malthusian limits?) and of limits to markets (is globalisation with free trade and free capital movements an unmixed blessing?)?"
2. "With UK real income per head up 15 times over the past 200 years and more evenly distributed, will this be repeated over the next 200 years? – and if not, why not?"
