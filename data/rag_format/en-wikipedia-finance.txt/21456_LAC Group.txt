## History

LAC Group was founded in 1986 by Deb Schwarz as a staffing agency specializing in law libraries.

By 1989, it was offering technical services and serving other academic and other special libraries. In 1999, Library Associates caused a stir in library circles and gained national attention when they were selected by Pillsbury Madison & Sutro LLP to manage their library operations.

The company continued its expansion into different markets with its acquisition of Medical Library Consultants (MLC) from Betsey Beamish in 2001 and of Sanad Support Technologies from Jodi
and Fuad Suleiman in 2003. With the acquisition of Sanad, Library Associates consisted of two divisions, Library Associates and Library Associates of Maryland, which were integrated as Library Associates Companies in 2007.

In 2009, the company name was changed to LAC Group. Subsequent acquisitions include spend management consulting firm Chase Cost Management in 2011, film archiving business PRO-TEK Vaults from Eastman Kodak in 2013, and competitive research agency ShiftCentral in 2019.
