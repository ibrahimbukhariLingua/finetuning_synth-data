## History


### Predecessor

Mälartåg originated from the establishment of *Tåg i Mälardalen AB* in 1991, which aimed to investigate the feasibility of a unified management system for train traffic in the Mälardalen region. In 1995, the company signed an agreement with SJ (Swedish State Railways) to operate regional train services in the area, leading to the formation of *Trafik i Mälardalen AB*. This partnership was jointly owned by SJ and Mälardalstrafik MÄLAB AB, each holding 50% of the company.

*Trafik i Mälardalen* facilitated ticketing and operational coordination, allowing tickets to be used on SJ's Regional and InterCity trains across various routes, including Linköping, Norrköping, Stockholm, and Uppsala. The *Trafik i Mälardalen* collaboration ended on September 30, 2017.


### Establishment

In December 2013, six public transport authorities in Mälardalen had already reached an agreement to develop train services in eastern Sweden. However, the project faced challenges when SJ opposed it, leading to a temporary halt in progress. After resolving legal issues, the authorities moved forward with their plans.

In June 2014, a decision was made to increase train traffic in the Mälardalen region by approximately 30%. This expansion aimed to enhance connectivity between Stockholm and surrounding areas, and involved plans to acquire additional trains. The initiative was supported by regional authorities. As part of the expansion, it was announced in February 2017 that Mälardalstrafik had ordered 33 new double-decker trains from the Swiss manufacturer Stadler. These trains were designed for operation on key routes in the Mälardalen region and were delivered from 2018.

The decision to expand services led to the introduction of Mälartåg, which began operations in conjunction with the *Movingo* period ticket launched on September 30, 2017. The *Movingo* ticket facilitated unlimited travel on SJ's regional trains and local public transport within the counties of Stockholm, Sörmland, Västmanland, Uppsala, Örebro, and Östergötland.


## Contract operators

Mälartåg is operated using a contract model, with Mälardalstrafik responsible for setting fares and service levels in collaboration with its six owner regions, as well as procuring rolling stock. Operations are tendered to a contracted operator, who delivers services based on these agreements. Mälardalstrafik itself employs 28 staff members, while the contracted operator is responsible for operational staff.


### SJ (2017 - 2021)

Mälardalstrafik had a contract with SJ for regional train services from 2017 to 2021. During this period, SJ operated trains using its existing fleet, which included locomotive-hauled passenger coaches and electric multiple units. As the contract progressed, Mälardalstrafik transitioned to using its own new rolling stock.


### MTR (2021-2024)

In December 2020, MTR Corporation was awarded the Mälartåg operating contract, which commenced on December 12, 2021. This contract was initially set to run until December 2029, with the option for a one-year extension. However, MTR faced significant challenges in establishing sustainable operations. On February 22, 2024, MTR announced the early termination of the Mälartåg contract.


### Transdev (2024-)

In February 2024, it was announced that Transdev would take over responsibility for Mälartåg services starting on June 16, 2024. This new contract, structured as a temporary 'emergency agreement', will last for two years and cover all of Mälartåg's services. The contract handover also involved the 700 Mälartåg employees from MTR, who were moved to Transdev.


## Rolling stock

Mälartåg operates two types of trains, both trains are owned by Transitio AB, a company jointly owned by several Swedish regions, and leased to Mälardalstrafik.


### ER1

Mälartåg's fleet primarily consists of Stadler DOSTO four-car double-deck electric multiple units, designated as ER1. The trains are a variant of the Stadler KISS series, adapted for the Swedish climate and loading gauge. They are capable of operating at -40°C with up to 800mm of snow on the tracks. Features include inter-vehicle gangways with insulated twin bellows, large snowploughs, and underframes are designed to minimise freezing. The first ER1 trains entered service on December 15, 2019, initially on the Arboga–Eskilstuna–Stockholm line. As of 2024, Mälardalstrafik operates a total of 53 ER1 double-decker trains.

* Following the integration of Upptåget into Mälartåg on June 12, 2022, 8 more ER1 units were added to the fleet.


### X50

In addition to the primary ER1 units, Mälartåg's fleet includes six Regina trains (designated as X50) from the early 2000s, which are used mainly on the Linköping - Katrineholm - Eskilstuna - Västerås - Sala line. These were acquired from the Upptåget integration in June 2022, and repainted to Mälartåg livery.
