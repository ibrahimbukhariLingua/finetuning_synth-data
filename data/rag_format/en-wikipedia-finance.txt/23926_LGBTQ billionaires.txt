# LGBTQ billionaires



Within the LGBTQ community, there are 14 known billionaires. As of 2015,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani is the richest person in the community (according to the LGBTQ-interest magazine *The Advocate*.)


## History

In 1980, the DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen came out as the first openly bisexual billionaire in the world. He had wanted to date women before such as Cher, but finally came to realise his sexuality in the early 1980s and had become one of the most important forces in the gay rights movement by 1992.

Giorgio Armani is known for being notoriously private and has remained relatively quiet about his own sexuality. *The Sunday Times* speculates he has remained quiet on the subject out of fear sales of Armani might decline in Asia if he officially came out. However, in 2000 he told *Vanity Fair*, "I have had women in my life. And sometimes men."

On 16 August 2013, Jennifer Pritzker made headlines by announcing that she identifies herself as a woman for all business and personal undertakings. This announcement made Pritzker the world's first openly transgender billionaire. In October 2015, Norway's second richest billionaire Stein Erik Hagen came out as bisexual on the Norwegian talk show Skavlan.
