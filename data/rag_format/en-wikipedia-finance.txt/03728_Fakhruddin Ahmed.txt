# Fakhruddin Ahmed



**Fakhruddin Ahmed** (Bengali: ফখরুদ্দীন আহমেদ, romanized: *Fokhruddin Ahmed*; born 1 May 1940) is a Bangladeshi economist, civil servant, and a former governor of the Bangladesh Bank, the country's central bank. He also served as the 4th Chief Adviser of Caretaker government of Bangladesh.

On 12 January 2007, he was appointed Chief Adviser (head of the government) of the non-political caretaker government, during the 2006–2008 Bangladeshi political crisis. He continued in that post for nearly two years, longer than the usual time, but new elections were held on 29 December 2008, and the Awami League assumed power based on its majority.


## Early life and career

Ahmed was born on 1 May 1940 in Rob Nagorkandi, Tongibari, Munshiganj to Mohiuddin Ahmed. He studied economics at Dhaka University, where he obtained his BA (Hons) and MA in 1960 and 1961, respectively, standing first in his class both times. He earned a master's degree in development economics from Williams College and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1975. His doctoral dissertation was titled "Migration and employment in a multisector model; an application to Bangladesh".

He also served as the 8th governor of Bangladesh Bank.

He then became managing director of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), the country's apex micro-finance organisation, beginning on 1 June 2005.


## 2007—2008 caretaker government

On 12 January 2007, President Iajuddin Ahmed swore him in as chief adviser of the caretaker government, after the former interim government under the president was dissolved. Fakhruddin Ahmed is credited with bringing an end to the anarchy that had threatened to sweep the nation.

More than 160 senior politicians, top civil servants, and security officials were arrested on charges of graft and other economic crimes. Included were former ministers from the two main political parties, the Bangladesh Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, including former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, and the former acting chief adviser Fazlul Haque. On January 11, 2007, the then President Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency in the country in view of the chaotic situation created by the political parties. At the same time, a caretaker government backed by the army was formed with Fakhruddin Ahmed as its chief adviser. With the assumption of power by Fakhruddin Ahmed, the caretaker government formed with the President as the Chief Adviser was dissolved. After assuming office, Fakhruddin Ahmed was highly praised for his significant contribution to reducing political and social unrest in the then national life. At that time, Fakhruddin Ahmed conducted various anti-corruption activities in Bangladesh, known as the most corrupt country in the world. At that time, about 160 politicians, government officials, security officials were sued on charges of embezzlement and other corruption.

Ahmed fainted while giving a speech at a tree-planting event on 3 June 2007, apparently due to the heat, and was hospitalized. He was released from the hospital later the same day and has said that he was well.

The Jatiya Sangsad elections were held on 29 December 2008 and the Awami League won two-thirds of the seats. Which marked the end of the Fakhruddin Ahmed ministry.

Ahmed has since retired from the public sphere and is now living in the United States.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
