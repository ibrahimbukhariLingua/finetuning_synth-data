Federation of Bakers


# Federation of Bakers



The **Federation of Bakers** is the main industry trade organisation in the UK for large-scale (industrial) baking of bread.


## History

The equivalent of around 11 million loaves of bread are sold in the UK each day. Large bread baking companies in the UK produce around 80% of bread sold (by value), and around 75% comes from three main companies; in-store bakeries produce around 17%; and craft bakers produce the rest.

The FOB was established in 1942 to help with the rationing of bread, called the National Loaf.


## Function

The industry is worth Â£3.5bn, with around 20,000 employees. There are around 33 main bread bakeries, with nine main companies. The organisation works with the Flour Advisory Bureau.


## Structure

It is headquartered in the London Borough of Camden, between the A400 (to the west) and Southampton Row (A4200, to the east).
