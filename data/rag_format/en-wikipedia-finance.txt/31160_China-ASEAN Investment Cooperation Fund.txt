The Export-Import Bank of China is the "anchor sponsor" with a "seed investment" of US$300 million. Three other Chinese institutions were "cornerstone investors", investing a combined US$500 million. The sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, "jointly founded" the fund along with the Export-Import Bank, according to the China Economic Review, quoting *The Wall Street Journal*. The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank invested US$100 million and became another "cornerstone investor."

Through an equity infusion, it took control of the former Negros Navigation and purchased the Aboitiz Transport System for US$105 million. The Aboitiz Transport System had been formed by first the break up of WG&A SuperFerry into SuperFerry and Carlos A.
