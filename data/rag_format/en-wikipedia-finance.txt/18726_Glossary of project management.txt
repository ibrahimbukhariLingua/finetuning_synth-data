# Glossary of project management



A glossary of terms relating to project management and consulting.


## A

* **Agile software development** is a set of fundamental principles about how software should be developed based on an agile way of working in contrast to previous heavy-handed software development methodologies.
* **Aggregate planning** is an operational activity which does an aggregate plan for the production process, in advance of 2 to 18 months, to give an idea to management as to what quantity of materials and other resources are to be procured and when, so that the total cost of operations of the organization is kept to the minimum over that period.
* **Allocation** is the assignment of available resources in an economic way.

## B

* **Benefits management plan** a document that describes the activities necessary for achieving the benefits of a project and when these planned benefits will be delivered. It also outlines metrics and procedures to measure progress against benefits.
* **BOSCARD** a strategic planning tool used in project management to give the Terms of reference for new projects.
* **Budget** generally refers to a list of all planned expenses and revenues.
* **Budgeted cost of work performed** (BCWP) measures the budgeted cost of work that has actually been performed, rather than the cost of work scheduled.
* **Budgeted cost of work scheduled** (BCWS) the approved budget that has been allocated to complete a scheduled task (or Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) component) during a specific time period.
* **Business case** a document that examines business need and cost-benefits analysis of a project to justify the approval of the project and to set its boundaries.
* **Business model** is a profit-producing system that has an important degree of independence from the other systems within an enterprise.
* **Business analysis** is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement or organizational change.
* **Business operations** are those ongoing recurring activities involved in the running of a business for the purpose of producing value for the stakeholders. They are contrasted with project management, and consist of business processes.
* **Business process** is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer or customers. There are three types of business processes: Management processes, Operational processes, and Supporting processes.
* **Business process modeling** (BPM) is the activity of representing processes of an enterprise, so that the current ("as is") process may be analyzed and improved in future ("to be").

## C

* **Capability maturity model** (CMM) in software engineering is a model of the maturity of the capability of certain business processes. A maturity model can be described as a structured collection of elements that describe certain aspects of maturity in an organization, and aids in the definition and understanding of an organization's processes.
* **Change control** is the procedures used to ensure that changes (within quality management systems (QMS) and information technology (IT) systems) are introduced in a controlled and coordinated manner. Change control is a major aspect of the broader discipline of change management.
* **Change management** is a field of management focused on organizational changes. It aims to ensure that methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes to controlled IT infrastructure, in order to minimize the number and impact of any related incidents upon service.
* **Case study** is a research method which involves an in-depth, longitudinal examination of a single instance or event: a case. They provide a systematic way of looking at events, collecting data, analyzing information, and reporting the results.

* **Constructability** is a project management technique to review the construction processes from start to finish during pre-construction phrase. It will identify obstacles before a project is actually built to reduce or prevent error, delays, and cost overrun.
* **Constructability review** is a process of reviewing design documents, construction drawings, specifications, and other construction documentation intended for use by a builder to construct the project. The purpose of a constructability review is to eliminate design errors, omissions, and coordination issues prior to bidding the documents so that the project bid is accurate, and less likely to create uncertainty, delays, added costs, or other risks during construction. Constructability reviews identify those risks so they can be corrected before bidding and constructing the project. Constructability reviews should be conducted by a multi-disciplined team of design, engineering, and construction professionals independent of the project designers. Constructability review comments should be addressed and resolved by modifying the bid documents prior to bidding or obtaining the construction contractor's price and before starting construction work to ensure accurate biddable, and buildable construction documents maximize construction efficiency, quality, and safety at the best price.
* **Costs** in economics, business, and accounting are the value of money that has been used up to produce something, and hence is not available for use anymore. In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost.

* **Construction**, in the fields of architecture and civil engineering, is a process that consists of the building or assembling of infrastructure. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of multitasking. Normally the job is managed by the project manager and supervised by the construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect.
* **Cost overrun** is defined as excess of actual cost over budget.
* **Critical path method** (CPM) is a mathematically based modeling technique for scheduling a set of project activities, used in project management.

* **Stakeholder** Clients or other parties invested in the Project.
* **Systems development life cycle** (SDLC) is any logical process used by a systems analyst to develop an information system, including requirements, validation, training, and user ownership.

## V

* **Value engineering** (VE) is a systematic method to improve the "value" of goods and services by using an examination of function. Value, as defined, is the ratio of function to cost. Value can therefore be increased by either improving the function or reducing the cost. It is a primary tenet of value engineering that basic functions be preserved and not be reduced as a consequence of pursuing value improvements.
* **Vertical slice** is a type of milestone, benchmark, or deadline, with emphasis on demonstrating progress across all components of a project.
* **Virtual design and construction** (VDC) is the use of integrated multi-disciplinary performance models of design-construction projects, including the Product (i.e., facilities), Work Processes and Organization of the design - construction - operation team in order to support explicit and public business objectives.

A Work breakdown structure element may be a product, data, a service, or any combination. WBS also provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimating and control along with providing guidance for schedule development and control.
* **Work package** is a subset of a project that can be assigned to a specific party for execution. Because of the similarity, work packages are often misidentified as projects.
* **Work stream** is a set of associated activities, focused around a particular scope that follow a path from initiation to completion.
