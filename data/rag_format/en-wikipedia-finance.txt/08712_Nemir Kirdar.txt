He completed his primary education at Baghdad's Saadoun School, his secondary education at the Jesuit-run Baghdad College, and his initial university education at Robert College in Istanbul, initially studying engineering then switching to economics and liberal arts. He envisioned to pursue a political career in his native Iraq, but after a military coup overthrew the Iraqi monarchy in 1958, Kirdar left Iraq to the United States where his cousins lived. Having only completed three out of four years at Robert College, he had to find a new university that would accept him into the final year for an economics degree.
