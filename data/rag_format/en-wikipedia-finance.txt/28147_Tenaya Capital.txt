Founded in 1995 as Lehman Brothers Venture Partners, Tenaya spun out to become an independent firm in 2009 following Lehman's bankruptcy. It opened its seventh fund in 2015. In 2009 the firm had approximately $750 million under management.


## Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and LBVP spin out

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. As part of the liquidation process, Lazard was appointed to sell certain interests in Lehman Brothers Venture Partners and its other private investment units.

In January 2009, HarbourVest Partners, a Boston private equity fund of funds, financed the spinout of Tenaya, acquiring Lehman's existing investment and unfunded commitments to Tenaya venture funds.
