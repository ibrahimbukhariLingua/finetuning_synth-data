The five accredited MBA programmes of the BPS aim to prepare graduates – with various foci – for leading positions in general management of businesses or in the healthcare sector. The BPS offers also three M.A. programmes and one certificate programme. In 2013 the BPS Berlin Professional School has been granted accreditation for its MBA provision by the Association of MBAs (AMBA).
