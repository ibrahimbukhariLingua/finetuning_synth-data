# SecFinex



**SecFinex** was a UK based electronic stock lending and borrowing platform that operated between 2000 and 2011.
It was closed down in December 2011 when its main owner NYSE Euronext said that despite it believing that central counterparty would play an important part in stock borrowing in the future the business had not gained enough tracking and they had decided to no longer financially support it.
The business was wound down and its authorization was removed from the FSA register on January 6, 2012.
