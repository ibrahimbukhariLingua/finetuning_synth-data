AAdvantage


# AAdvantage



**AAdvantage** is the frequent-flyer program of American Airlines. Launched May 1, 1981, it was the second such loyalty program in the world (after the first at Texas International Airlines in 1979) and remains the largest, with more than 115 million members as of April, 2021.

Miles accumulated in the program allow members to redeem tickets, upgrade service class, or obtain free or discounted car rentals, hotel stays, merchandise, or other products and services through partners. The most active members, based on the amount and price of travel booked, are designated AAdvantage Gold, AAdvantage Platinum, AAdvantage Platinum Pro, and AAdvantage Executive Platinum elite members, with privileges such as separate check-in, priority upgrade and standby processing, or free upgrades. They also receive similar privileges from AA's partner airlines, particularly those in oneworld. AAdvantage co-branded credit cards are also available and offer other benefits. These cards are issued by Barclaycard and CitiCards in the United States, and by Butterfield Bank and Scotiabank in the Caribbean.

AAdvantage allows one-way redemption, starting at 7,500 miles.


## History

Increased competition following the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act prompted airline marketing professionals to develop ways to reward repeat customers and build brand loyalty. The first idea at American, a special "loyalty fare", was modified and expanded to offer free first-class tickets and upgrades to first class for companions, or discounted coach tickets. Membership was seeded by searching American's SABRE computer reservations system for recurring phone numbers. The 130,000 most frequent flyers, plus an additional 60,000 members of the airline's Admirals Club were pre-enrolled and sent letters with their new account numbers. The name was selected by American's advertising agency and is consistent with other American Airlines programs featuring "AA" in the name and logo. The original logo was designed by Massimo Vignelli.

Less than a week later, rival United Airlines launched its MileagePlus program; other airlines followed in the ensuing months and years. The rapid appearance of competition changed the nature of the program, and as airlines began to compete on the features of their frequent flyer programs, AAdvantage liberalized its rules, established partnerships with hotel and rental car agencies, and offered promotions such as extra free beverages. In 1982 AAdvantage also became the first program to cooperate with an international carrier; members could accrue and redeem miles on British Airways flights to Europe.

In 1988, major airlines, including American, offered triple miles. This led to increases in the number of miles needed for awards. During this time, miles, which originally had no expiration, began to have an expiration of three years, later reduced to 18 months, where an account would be closed if there was no activity during this time.

In 2005 American Airlines joined other major U.S. carriers in introducing an online shopping portal allowing shoppers to earn AAdvantage miles when shopping online.

In 2016, AAdvantage began crediting miles based on the amount of the airfare, not the distance traveled. This change was accompanied by increases in miles needed for an award.

In 2022, American Airlines simplified the method of keeping track of earning miles for AAdvantage status. It was formerly required to keep track of three metrics: EQM (Elite Qualifying Miles), EQS (Elite Qualifying Segments), and EQD (Elite Qualifying Dollars). The update replaced the three metrics with a single metric: Loyalty Points. Besides flying, members can use their AAdvantage credit card for purchases.

Beginning January 1, 2017, elite qualifying dollars were added to AAdvantage's tier qualification status. Beginning 2022, elite qualifying miles/segments/dollars were replaced with Loyalty Points.

## Miles expiration

When American first started their frequent-flyer program, miles credited to AAdvantage members’ accounts never expired. In 1989, American implemented an expiration policy where miles would expire if there wasn't any account activity over a three-year period. In 2012, American revised their policy by lowering the required activity timeframe to 18 months. Miles that were not previously subject to expiration were given a 25% bonus before adopting the new 18-month expiration policy.

In March 2022, American again revised their expiration policy by increasing the timeframe for required activity to 24 months. Miles in members' accounts who are under 21 years of age are exempt from the account activity requirement. Expired miles cannot be used for award travel. To reactivate previously earned miles, AAdvantage plan members can pay a fee ranging from $200–$600. Of the three main legacy carriers in the United States, American is the only one that continues to maintain an expiration policy; Delta and United both relinquished such policies in 2011 and 2019, respectively.
