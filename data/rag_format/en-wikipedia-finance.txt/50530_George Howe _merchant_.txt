# George Howe (merchant)



**George Howe** (1819â€“1899) of Boston was a 19th-century merchant, industrialist, and investor. He was, with David Nevins Sr., co-owner of Pemberton Mill when it collapsed in what is "likely the worst industrial accident in Massachusetts history" and "one of the worst industrial calamities in American history".


## Pemberton disaster

Howe, together with banker David Nevins, previously bought the mill at an auction for $325,000 and reorganized it as Pemberton Manufacturing Company. The facility itself was closed and sold by John A. Lowell and associates during the Panic of 1857. According to later court testimony reported by *The New York Times*, Howe escaped just as the structure was falling. During Howe's weekly inspection of the workrooms on the day of the disaster, he recalled, "we discovered at once the columns were falling towards ourselves; the beams were sinking; we then turned around to make an escape; I deemed it extremely doubtful whether we should get out; but we fortunately did."

The Massachusetts Historical Society is now the custodian of papers:
