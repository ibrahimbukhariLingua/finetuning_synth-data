## History


### Early years

The People Tree business developed from Global Village, an environmental campaigning NGO founded by British born Safia Minney in Tokyo in 1991. It began as a clothing catalogue which featured hand woven and natural dyed hand bags, clothing, and clogs made by women from Bangladesh. Because it was difficult to find fair trade apparel products of a high enough quality for the Japanese market, Global Village started to do its own design in house. Safia Minney said, "When I started out […] we were investing in labour-intensive process while the industry was going in the other direction: mass-manufactured fashion, using synthetics instead of natural materials. We were dealing with very disadvantaged people in remote places."

Initially the Global Village business was run from the home of Safia Minney and her then-husband James Minney, who later became her business partner in founding People Tree. In 1995, Fair Trade Company KK was formed as a limited company in Japan by transferring the fair trading activity of Global Village, and a shop was opened in the fashionable Jiyugaoka district, in Tokyo. In 1997, Safia Minney added a Fair Trade Fashion Collection, using eco-textiles, including organic cotton, to the products sold by Fair Trade Company. People Tree was working closely with textile artisan groups to help them meet environmental standards and develop their market potential, with two full-time designers.

In 2005, People Tree Japan launched its first 'prototype franchise' store in Tokyo.
