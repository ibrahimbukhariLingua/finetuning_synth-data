PNI Digital Media


# PNI Digital Media



**PNI Digital Media, Inc.** is a company that operates an enterprise-class e-commerce platform which allows retailers to provide print-on-demand personalized products and services to their customers. Retailers who license the PNI platform use PNI's software to offer photo prints, photo gift merchandise, small business marketing products, document printing services and other print-on-demand merchandise.

Large companies like Costco, Sam's Club and Staples use PNI Digital Media's software platform to allow customers to create and order personalized products such as photo prints, photo books, canvas prints, photo calendars, greeting cards, invitations, business cards, signage and documents.


## Retailers

The company launched in Vancouver, B.C., in 2001, taking on Walmart Canada as their first major photo site client in 2002. From 2003 to 2007, the company also provided its software platform for photo sites for Costco Canada, Blacks, Chapters, Loblaws and others.

PNI then expanded into the US marketplace by licensing its software platform to CVS Health (then CVS/pharmacy), Costco and Sam's Club, the contracts of which were then lost several years later.

As of February 2017, PNI also licenses its software platform to retailers such as Staples, Staples Canada, Tesco, FedEx Office and Quill. As of June 6th 2022 PNI's only licenses its software platform to Staples US, and has faced severe downsizing, with most offices across the globe being closed down.


## History

PNI Digital Media was formerly known as PhotoChannel Networks Inc., and the name was officially changed in June 2009.

On July 11, 2014, the company was acquired by Staples, Inc. for $74 million.

Commencing July 14, 2015, the online photo centres for Walmart Canada, CVS, Costco, and Rite Aid, all operated by PNI, were investigating credit card fraud. After being down for several weeks, the photo sites began to be re-launched in September 2015, rebuilt with enhanced security measures.
