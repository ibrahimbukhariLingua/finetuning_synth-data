***Pari passu*** is a Latin phrase that literally means "with an equal step" or "on equal footing". It is sometimes translated as "ranking equally", "hand-in-hand", "with equal force", or "moving together", and by extension, "fairly", "without partiality".


## Etymology

* *pari* is the ablative singular masculine (since it must grammatically agree with *passu*) of the adjective *par*, "equal". If it were nominative, "an equal step" it would be *par passus*.
* *passu* is the ablative of the Latin noun *passus*, "step".

This term is commonly used in law. *Black's Law Dictionary* (8th ed., 2004) defines *pari passu* as "proportionally; at an equal pace; without preference".


## Usage


### In inheritance

In inheritance, a *pari passu* (*per capita*) distribution can be distinguished from a *per stirpes* (by family branch) distribution.

For example, suppose a testator had two children A and B. A has two children, and B has three.

* If the testator leaves his or her entire estate to his or her grandchildren in equal shares *pari passu*, each grandchild would inherit one fifth of the estate.
* In contrast, if the estate was left to the grandchildren *per stirpes* (by family branch), the children of A would share one half of the estate equally between the two of them, and the children of B would share one half of the estate equally amongst the three of them.

### In lending, bankruptcy and default

This term is also often used in the lending area and in bankruptcy proceedings, where creditors are said to be paid *pari passu*, or each creditor is paid *pro rata* in accordance with the amount of his claim. Here its meaning is "equally and without preference".
There have been cases where decisions were based on different interpretations of the term.

In the European Union, as the result of the Greek government-debt crisis, a retroactive collective action clause passed by the Greek government with the support of the ECB and IMF, enabled the debtor (who also controlled the courts) to impose a 70% loss on the creditors, more than 75% of whom had voted in favour of the cut. In this case, *pari passu* means that all private-sector investors are equally treated.
