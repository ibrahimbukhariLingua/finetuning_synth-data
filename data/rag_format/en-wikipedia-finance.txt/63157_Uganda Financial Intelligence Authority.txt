## History

The parliamentary bill creating UFIA was passed in July 2013, after two previous attempts. Known as the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the law puts Uganda in harmony with its East African Community neighbors, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda, which passed similar laws before.


## Administration

Established under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, UFIA operates independently under the direction of its own board of directors. UFIA's management team is led by the executive director, who is appointed by the Minister of Finance on the recommendation of the board. In August 2014, the Ugandan Cabinet agreed on the following five members, to constitute the UFIA board.

* Leo Kibirango - Chairperson
* Grace Akullo
* Patrick Ocailap
* Titus Wasswa Mulindwa
* Patricia Mutesi

## Recent developments

In July 2014, Maria Kiwanuka, Uganda's finance minister, appointed Sydney Asubo, an experienced lawyer, to act as the interim executive director for six months while the agency's board of directors was being constituted.

Asubo's mandate includes the establishment of the agency, by hiring staff and setting up operation structures.

In February 2016, the UFIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Directorate of Public Prosecutions and the Uganda Registration Services Bureau. The MoU is meant to minimize the bureaucracy associated with government institutions and ease free flow of information between the three government agencies.
