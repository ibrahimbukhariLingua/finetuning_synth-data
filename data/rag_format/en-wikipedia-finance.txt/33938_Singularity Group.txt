## History

Singularity was founded as a non-profit and initially offered an annual 10-week summer program called the Graduate Studies Program (GSP), it was aimed at individuals wanting to understand how they could use technology to tackle global challenges. Its original Corporate founding partners and sponsors included Google, Nokia, Autodesk, IDEO,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ LinkedIn,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ the X Prize Foundation, ePlanet Ventures, the Kauffman Foundation and Genentech. Google subsequently ended its grant of $1.5 million annually.

Singularity University began the process for conversion to a for-profit benefit corporation. In 2013, the new for-profit corporation incorporated as "Singularity Education Group" and acquired "Singularity University" as its trade name. In 2018, faculty leaders noted that the company was focused only on profit; "it's lost its soul...It’s become a moneymaking corporation." The next year, it acquired *Futurism News*, moved the headquarters from the NASA Research Park at NASA Ames to Santa Clara, California, and added new Country Partner franchises in Brazil and Australia. *Futurism News* was later sold in 2021 to Recurrent Ventures. The following year, Pioneer Adaptive Learning Platform was acquired by Talespin.

SU Labs is a seed accelerator by Singularity University, targeting startups that aim to "change the lives of a billion people."

In 2011, a Singularity University group launched Matternet, a startup that aims to harness drone technology to ship goods in developing countries that lack highway infrastructure. Other startups from SU are the peer-to-peer car-sharing service Getaround, and BioMine, which uses mining technologies to extract value from electronic waste.


## Controversies

An investigative report from *Bloomberg Businessweek* found many issues with the organization, including an alleged sexual harassment of a student by a teacher, theft and aiding of theft by an executive, and allegations of gender and disability discrimination. Several early members of Singularity University were convicted of crimes, including Bruce Klein, who was convicted in 2012 of running a credit fraud operation in Alabama, and Naveen Jain, who was convicted of insider trading in 2003.

In February 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, *MIT Technology Review* reported that a group owned by Singularity, called Abundance 360, had held a "mostly maskless" event in Santa Monica in violation of the local stay-at-home order that became a superspreading event. The event, led by Singularity co-founder Peter Diamandis, charged up to $30,000 for tickets. In a followup article, *MIT Technology Review* revealed that after COVID-19 started spreading among attendees, Diamandis tried to sell them "fraudulent" treatments including inhaled amniotic fluid and ketamine lozenges, which a professor of law and medicine at Stanford University characterized as "quackery". The superspreading event was covered widely by publications including the *New York Times*, the *Washington Post*, and the *Los Angeles Times*.
