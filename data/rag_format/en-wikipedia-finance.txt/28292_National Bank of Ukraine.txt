# National Bank of Ukraine



The **National Bank of Ukraine** (Ukrainian: Національний банк України, romanized: *Natsionalnyi bank Ukrainy* [nɐt͡sʲiɔˈnalʲnei̯ bank ʊkrɐˈjine], **NBU** / **НБУ**) is the central bank of Ukraine. Created in 1991 from the Ukrainian operations of the Soviet Gosbank, the NBU employs over 12,000 people, making it one of the largest employers in the financial sector in Ukraine. It regulates and supervises activities, functions and the legal status of public and commercial banks based on the principles of the Constitution of Ukraine and the law of Ukraine.


## History

The State Bank of Ukraine [uk] (Український державний банк) was a predecessor of the NBU, founded on 22 December 1917 under a law passed by the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic on the basis of the Kyiv branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire. It functioned under the UPR and Ukrainian State governments until it was liquidated by the Bolsheviks at the end of the Ukrainian War of Independence.

The Ukrainian branch of the Soviet Gosbank took on central banking functions in Ukraine in early 1991. Like institutions of many newly independent nations, it faced dire financial straits during the 1990s, leading to a prolonged period of hyperinflation. On 20 March 1991, the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) adopted the resolution "On Banks and Banking Activity", which became law on May 1. The resolution declared ownership by the Ukrainian SSR of the Ukrainian Republican branch of the Gosbank, which was subsequently renamed the **National Bank**. The same resolution simultaneously nationalized the Ukrainian Republic branch of the Soviet Promstroybank renamed Prominvestbank, the Ukrainian Republic branch of the Savings Bank of the USSR, and the Ukrainian Republic branch of the Foreign Trade Bank of the USSR as well as the Ukrainian Republic Department of cash settlement of the Soviet Gosbank.

Following the introduction of martial law on 24 February 2022, the National Bank of Ukraine took the extraordinary step of creating and promoting two separate accounts to receive donations (domestic and international) as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine: one account to support the Ukrainian military, and the other account to support the general populace with humanitarian assistance. On 5 March 2022, the NBU reported having raised "more than UAH 10 billion" (roughly USD $350 million) for military and humanitarian aid.


## Legal status and structure

The legal status of the National Bank of Ukraine and the principles of its organization and activities are determined by the Constitution of Ukraine and the Law of Ukraine "On the National Bank of Ukraine".

## Functions

According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the main function of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is to ensure the stability of Ukraine's monetary unit (the hryvnia). To carry this out, the National Bank fosters the stability of the banking system and, within its competence, price stability.

Due to Art.51 of the law on the National Bank of Ukraine, the NBU is accountable for its activities to the Verkhovna Rada (the parliament of Ukraine), the President of Ukraine and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.


### Banking supervision

As part of its central banking functions, the National Bank bears responsibility for banking regulation and supervision in Ukraine.

All registered banks in Ukraine are member of the Deposit Guarantee Fund, which provides deposit insurance up to 200.000 UAH (approx. USD $5000) per person and bank in case of insolvency. Until 2022, Oshadnybank was excluded from this fund because the Ukrainian state guaranteed its deposits directly. It joined the DGF in April 2022.

Banks are divided by the National Bank into four categories depending on their size (for intensity of banking supervision).

Since 2016, the Bank's Anti-Money Laundering and Tax-Evasion Policy has required the ownership structures of banks to published.
