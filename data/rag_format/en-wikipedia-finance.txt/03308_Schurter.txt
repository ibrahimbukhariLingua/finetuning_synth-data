# Schurter



**Schurter Holding AG** is a Swiss multinational manufacturer of electrical and electronic components and a provider of electronic services which is based in Lucerne, Switzerland.

The group of companies, which is represented in around 60 countries, employs over 2000 employees and generated sales of 289 million Swiss francs in 2018.


## History

The Schurter company was founded in 1933 by Heinrich Schurter as a limited partnership and was converted into a stock corporation in 1949. In 1990 Schurter Holding AG, which still exists today, was founded in Lucerne (Switzerland). Today, Schurter employs around 2000 people in 17 countries worldwide and is managed by third-generation family members: Hans-Rudolf Schurter is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Schurter Holding AG and his brother, the US-based Bruno H. Schurter, is Vice Chairman. Hans-Rudolf Schurter handed over the operational management of the Schurter Group to Ralph Müller in January 2015. For the first time in the company's more than 80 year history, the operational management of Schurter was thus transferred to external family hands. In order to secure its position as a leading innovator and producer of electronic components, the Schurter Group has been significantly expanded in recent years through acquisitions. In 2024, Schuter Group had officially expanded its product line into the Supercapacitor industry, through a strategic technology partnership with CAP-XX (a London Stock Exchange listed, Australian supercapacitor manufacturer). The new supercapacitor product line became available to Schurter's clients in February 2025.
