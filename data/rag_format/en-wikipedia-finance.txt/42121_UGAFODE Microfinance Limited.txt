## History

UGAFODE was founded in 1994 as the Uganda Agency for Development Limited, a non-governmental organization whose primary objective was to provide affordable financial services to its customers. In September 2010, in preparation to become an MDI, UGAFODE Microfinance Limited was incorporated as a limited company.

In 2011, the institution accepted eight new shareholders, including Ezra Suruma, Uganda minister of finance from 2005 until 2009 and senior adviser for finance and planning to the President of Uganda. Suruma also had an ownership interest in the National Bank of Commerce (Uganda), a Tier I commercial bank, which was closed in 2012.

An application was made to the Bank of Uganda for the issuance of an MDI banking license. In October 2011, a Tier III MDI licence was granted, and MDI operations began on 10 October 2011.

As of March 2014ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the institution's total assets were about US$10.07 million (UGX:25.34 billion), with shareholders' equity of about US$2.25 million (UGX:5.66 billion).
