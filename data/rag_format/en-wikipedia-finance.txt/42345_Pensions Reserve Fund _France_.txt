Pensions Reserve Fund (France)


# Pensions Reserve Fund (France)



The **French Pension Reserve Fund** (French: *Fonds de Réserve pour les Retraites*, FRR) is a public entity created by law n°2001-624 dated 17 July 2001. Its mission is to invest monies entrusted to it by the public authorities on behalf of the community with the aim of financing the French pension system.
Its investment policy is to optimize returns on the investments it makes as prudently as possible. Its policy must be consistent with those collective values that are designed to promote balanced economic, social and environmental development.


## Assets under management

As of December 2016 the FRR's assets are 36 billion Euros.


## History

At its creation the target was to build a reserve fund of 150 billion Euro by 2020. The funds were to come from 4 sources:

* Surpluses of certain social security funds (Fonds de solidarité vieillesse)
* Privatization resources
* Mobile phone licences
* Stock market transaction tax

After initially receiving funds from the FSV and 1.2 billion from the privatization of the Autoroute company (Autoroutes du sud de la France) since 2003 the fund has been funded mainly by 65% of the investment tax of 2%.
The fund was set up to guarantee the financial stability of:

* The CNAV (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Viellesse or National Pension Insurance Bank),
* Organic (Caisse de retraite des commerçants et des chefs d’entreprises commerciales or Pensions Bank of the traders), et
* Cancava (Caisse de retraite des artisans or Pensions Bank of craftsmen).

First payments were set to start in 2020.


## Details on the FRR's role

The FRR is a long-run investor. Its mission as conferred by law is to “manage the sums that are allocated to it, to build up reserves to help ensure the long-term future of eligible retirement plans”.
The Fund is also responsible for the financial management of a portion of the exceptional, one-off, lump-sum contribution owed to the CNAV (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse).

The government has set out a timetable for the payout of the Fund's assets. Under the terms of the social security financing law 2011,“the sums allocated to the Fund are held in reserve until 1st January 2011. As from this date and up until 2024, the Fund shall each year, and at the latest by 31 October, pay 2.1 billion euros to the national social debt amortization fund (Caisse d’Amortissement de la Dette Sociale - CADES) to help finance, between 2011 and 2018” the deficits of the entities that administer the basic pension.

On this basis the FRR determines the general investment policy guidelines consistent with"the principles of prudence and risk diversification given the target timetable for utilisation of the Fund's resources, in particular the above-mentioned payout obligations".In its implementation, the aim of the FRR's investment policy is also to help finance economic actors in general and businesses in particular. This in turn helps to consolidate their prospects for long-term growth and promote sustainable wealth creation and job growth. At the same time, it is consistent with certain shared values that promote balanced economic, social and environmental development. In 2008, the Supervisory Board adopted a responsible investment strategy which seeks to enable the Fund to honour its commitments as a signatory to the UN's PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment).
