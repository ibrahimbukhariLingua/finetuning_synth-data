## Career

His previous government service includes senior staff positions with the Securities Exchange Commission and the U.S. Senate, including as counsel to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. In the private sector, he has been an executive of a financial services and technology company, and managing director of merchant banking and public affairs strategy firms. He also served as senior vice president of the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Belt became the executive direction of PBGC in April 2004. The PBGC was set up by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, to guarantee defined benefit pension plan benefits for plan sponsors that become insolvent when there are too few pension plan assets to fully pay all insured pension benefits. As the chief executive officer of PBGC, Belt oversaw the U.S. government corporation that insures the pension benefits of private sector workers and retirees. He also played a leading role in the historic overhaul of U.S. pension rules, giving millions of Americans a better chance of getting the retirement benefits they earned. The bill also created added incentives for greater worker participation in 401(K)s. During Belt's tenure as director, the PBGC took on extensive liabilities from terminated pension plans, including United Air Lines, and became massively underfunded. On March 23, 2006 he announced his intention to resign effective May 2006.

He previously served as senior vice president of CSIS, responsible for policy development, corporate strategy, and oversight of the Center's international finance, information technology, and domestic policy initiatives.

Belt joined the Milken Institute from Palisades Capital, a boutique restructuring advisory and investment firm he co-founded. Prior to establishing Palisades, he served in the Bush administration as the executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. As the chief executive officer of the PBGC, Belt was responsible for the operations and management of a $50 billion investment portfolio. Under his leadership, PBGC restructured its operations, adopted a new liability-driven investment policy, implemented performance-based human capital management strategies, established new risk management and internal control systems, and oversaw the resolution of many of the agency's largest and most complex financial settlements. Belt had been previously appointed by President Bush to the Social Security Advisory Board, and he helped shape and communicate administration policy on pension and retirement security issues.
