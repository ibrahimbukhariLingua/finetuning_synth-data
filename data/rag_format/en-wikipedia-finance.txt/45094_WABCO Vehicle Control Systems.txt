WABCO Vehicle Control Systems


# WABCO Vehicle Control Systems



**WABCO Holdings, Inc.** was a U.S.-based provider of electronic braking, stability, suspension and transmission automation systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles. In 2007, the Vehicle Control Systems was spun off as WABCO Holdings Inc., an American provider of electronic braking, stability, suspension and transmission automation systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Their products are present in many commercial vehicles such as trucks, buses, trailers and off-highway vehicles but they only fill the niche roles. WABCO was acquired by ZF Friedrichshafen in May 2020.


## History

The Westinghouse Air Brake Company was founded in the U.S. in 1869 and acquired by American Standard in 1968. It was designated as American Standards' Vehicle Control Systems division. The earthmoving and mining product range was sold to Dresser Industries in 1984. American Standard changed its name to Trane, Inc. and on July 31, 2007, Trane spun off its Vehicle Control Systems as WABCO Holdings, Inc. via a special dividend to its shareholders. The owners of Trane, Inc. stock received one share of WABCO Holdings for every three shares of Trane, Inc. which they held. Trane, Inc. was acquired by Ingersoll-Rand the following year.

Previously headquartered in Bern, Switzerland (having moved from Brussels, Belgium in February 2019), WABCO employed more than 11000 people in 34 countries worldwide. In 2013, WABCO's total sales were $2,720.5 million, a rise of 10% over the previous year. WABCO was a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange as WABCO Holdings, Inc., with the stock symbol WBC.


### Acquisition by ZF Friedrichshafen

On February 27, 2019, WABCO's stock price increased 8% on rumors of a takeover bid by a competitor and trading in the stock was suspended. The following day, a trade publication reported that WABCO had confirmed that it had "been approached" by German auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen and was "engaged in preliminary discussions concerning a potential transaction.”

On March 28, 2019, ZF Friedrichshafen announced plans to acquire WABCO for $136.50 per share ($7 billion) in an all-cash transaction. The offer represented a 13% premium above WABCO's February 26 stock price, according to The Wall Street Journal. WABCO shareholders approved the acquisition in July 2019.

In January 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice raised concerns about the market power that the combined entity would have if the acquisition was allowed to proceed. In a news release, a Justice Department spokesman said: “The merger, as originally structured, would have given ZF a monopoly over an essential steering systems component used in trucks and buses that move products and people across the United States.” WABCO was required to divest the steering systems business in order to proceed with the transaction.
The companies reached a settlement with the Department of Justice, and ZF completed the $7 billion takeover in May 2020.

On 29 May 2020, WABCO was acquired by ZF Friedrichshafen through a merger agreement and thereafter became the Commercial Vehicle Control Systems division of ZF.
