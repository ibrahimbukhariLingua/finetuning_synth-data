The Henderson


# The Henderson



**The Henderson** is a skyscraper in Central, Hong Kong. The 36-storey building will rise to a height of 190 metres (623 feet). It is designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. The site at 2 Murray Road was reportedly the world's most expensive plot, worth US$3 billion, when it was purchased by developer Henderson Land Development in 2017, leading to the demolition of the car park at the site. Construction began in 2019 and was completed in 2024.

As of May 2024, 60% of its lettable space is occupied. Some notable tenants include British auction house Christie's, the CPP Investment Board, Audemars Piguet and Carlyle. On 7 June 2024, The Henderson welcomed its first batch of tenants.


## History

The much-anticipated Murray Road Project was named "The Henderson" by Henderson Land. The project was set to become an "icon amongst icons". At the time of its purchase in 2017, the site had attained a record for the highest value of land in the world. This super Grade-A office tower covers 465,000 square feet.

The US$2-billion skyscraper, targeted for completion in 2023, has already garnered several awards, accolades, and top certifications in sustainability standards, including the Platinum Pre-certification in WELL Building Standard and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. Upon completion, this instantly recognisable landmark will further reinforce Henderson Land's portfolio of investment properties.

Henderson Land debuted an industry-first ESG Partnership Programme at The Henderson in May 2022. Tenants will also be allowed access to an intelligent data platform for the tracking and reporting of sustainability performances. Henderson Land is devoted to promoting sustainability at the forefront and fostering a move collectively towards better ESG practices. The scheme works on the principle of a two-way street: incentivising tenants and their employees to pursue ESG-positive initiatives by offering incentives and a sophisticated data platform that can track, analyse, and quantify ESG performance, supported by effective reporting.

The Henderson earned Double Platinum Certification for WiredScore and SmartScore, making it one of the first commercial projects in Hong Kong to achieve this recognition in November 2022. These awards highlight the Group's commitment to top-quality digital connectivity and smart building standards. The Henderson was designed to give tenants a superior workplace right in the heart of Hong Kong's central business district. With these accreditations, The Henderson joins other iconic landmarks around the world—including the Shard in London and New York's Empire State Building—renowned for excellence in sustainability and innovation.

A Swiss luxury watchmaker joined other leading companies like Christie's and Carlyle as a prominent tenant at The Henderson in September 2023. Additionally, The Henderson has signed a lease with an international art gallery, known for its expertise and presence in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. With these new tenants, the occupancy of The Henderson's rentable floors is nearing 50%.

In June 2024, The Henderson welcomed the first batch of tenants into The Henderson, a new iconic landmark for Hong Kong and a super Grade-A commercial development nestled in the heart of Central. The Group also announced its plans to create the first sculpture park by Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA) in the public space outside the iconic building, as an extension of ZHA’s design of The Henderson.

The Henderson is Zaha Hadid Architects' (ZHA) first commercial project in Hong Kong. The design will extend to the nearby Lambeth Walk Rest Garden, transforming it into ZHA's first sculpture park in Asia. Once enhancement works are complete, the space will feature art installations, offering a unique green recreational area for the community.

The Henderson combines art, innovation, and sustainability to provide a top-tier, smart office experience for its tenants. The third-floor lobby features the Balloon Swan (Red) sculpture by famous artist Jeff Koons, which is the first of its kind in Asia and complements the building's design. The 39th-floor glass rooftop banquet hall, the tallest of its kind in Hong Kong, offers a range of hospitality services.


## Design

The design of The Henderson is inspired by the bud of the Bauhinia flower, which is the symbol of Hong Kong. Designed by world-renowned architect Zaha Hadid, it represents a flower about to bloom, symbolising The Henderson's role in shaping a new future.

Situated at the heart of the city, and enveloped by parks, The Henderson offers respite from the bustling urban lifestyle. From a stunning landscaped garden fronting the street to the multi-purpose Sky Garden on the 22nd floor. The glass rooftop banquet hall on the 39th floor stands at the highest in Hong Kong and serves a diversity of hospitality services.


## Tenants

It has so far confirmed 6 tenants, where the Carlyle Group and its subsidiary AlpInvest Partners Limited will lease about 20,000 sq. ft. space, while the CPPIB will lease 2 floors comprising about 28,000 sq. ft. In July 2021, it was announced that auction house Christie's would lease 4 floors for its Asia-Pacific headquarters, auction centre, and gallery. British private equity firm Coller Capital leased 4,500 square feet (less than one floor). Asian hedge fund Pamalican Asset Management rented 3,500 square feet. Brilliance Auto Group of China leased 6,600 square feet for about HK$792,000 a month.
