## Carriage and content disputes


### GMA Network signal tampering/distortion

In February 2003, GMA Network filed a complaint against SkyCable for allegedly moving its signal from channel 12 without approval of the National Telecommunications Commission. Authorities decided on April 25, 2003, that SkyCable violated the provisions of Memorandum Circular 4-08-88 and ordered to carry the free-to-air television signal on its system except when theoretically impracticable. It also ordered SkyCable to faithfully and strictly conforms with the requirements and to conclude from randomly changing channel assignments without notice and approval from local authorities. As a result, SkyCable filed a motion for reconsideration addressing the rule invalidate the means as it conflicts with a state law on intellectual property but local authorities denied the motion and directed SkyCable to comply with its previous decision. Consequently, the latter filed another appeal through an appellate court but still rejected their request and ordered them to conform to local authorities resolution.

In August 2015, SkyCable Corporation answered GMA Network's complaint over the loss of television signal during the *KalyeSerye* segment of *Eat Bulaga!*. Citing tweets from outraged fans of the AlDub love team featured in the said segment of the noon-time show, GMA filed a complaint before the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) through a letter dated Aug. 25. The network said subscribers "are being short-changed through irresponsible acts of their service provider" and appealed for the NTC to take immediate action about the "apparent sabotage" perceived by the viewers. In its statement, SkyCable denied the accusations assuring their customers of their commitment to provide the best service and resolve any glitches.
“The complaint of GMA 7 with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) last August 25, 2015, regarding shortchanging of our SkyCable subscribers via irresponsible acts, is a malicious accusation and is without basis," the Lopez-owned firm said. "If there were service interruptions that inconvenienced some of our subscribers, these were isolated and would have affected other channels, not only GMA 7." The cable provider also expressed their willingness to cooperate with investigations that the NTC may pursue regarding the incident.


### Carriage disputes with Solar Entertainment

On January 1, 2008, Solar Entertainment Corporation pulled its 6 cable channels from Sky Cable; namely Basketball TV, Solar Sports, ETC Entertainment Central, 2nd Avenue, Jack TV and Crime/Suspense. The channels were replaced by 6 new channels owned by fellow subsidiary Creative Programs, Inc.; AXN Beyond, Balls, Fox Crime, KidsCo, Maxxx and Velvet. While vice president Juno Chuidian stated in a report to GMA News TV (now GTV, then QTV 11) that the new channels were added because they would offer less "redundant" programming and feature more series that had never been aired in the country before, reports surfaced that the channels were pulled due to a dispute; ABS-CBN believed that Solar's lower fees for advertising on its channels were causing ABS-CBN to lose revenue.

Solar Entertainment however, retaliated by expanding its partnership with the terrestrial broadcaster Radio Philippines Network; adding programming from its C/S cable channel to its primetime lineup, and using the channel as part of its successful bid against ABS-CBN for the next PBA broadcast contract.


### AksyonTV

On March 14, 2011, TV5 filed a complaint to the National Telecommunications Commission against Sky Cable, accusing it of refusing to carry AksyonTV, despite law designating all free-to-air television networks as must-carry channels. The channel was added to Sky Cable's digital lineup on April 30, 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
