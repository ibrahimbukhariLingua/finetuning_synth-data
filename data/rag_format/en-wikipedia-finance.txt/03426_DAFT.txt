DAFT


# DAFT



The **Dutch-American Friendship Treaty** (also known as **DAFT** or Dutch American Residency Treaty) is an agreement between the United States and the Netherlands signed into law at The Hague on March 27, 1956. The treaty is a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation with protocols. The treaty allows US Entrepreneurs to acquire Dutch residency for the purpose of starting a business. The treaty also allows Dutch traders and investors to enter the US and engage in business in the US.


## Implications for US Entrepreneurs

The treaty makes it easier for US Entrepreneurs to open businesses in The Netherlands. It lowers the amount of needed investment capital from €27,000 to €4,500,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ frees US Entrepreneurs from the points-based test, and removes the benefit to Dutch national interests requirement. The residency permit is good for two years, after which it can be renewed for five years. The treaty is valid for all US citizens who are opening a business in the Netherlands or its territories. The visa can be granted whether the applicant starts a Dutch corporation [nl] or a sole proprietor entity [nl].

As of 2024, the Dutch immigration authorities (IND) have adopted an expedited DAFT application process. The IND has chosen for a method of random checks after the application instead of during the process. This means the DAFT visa usually is issued within 4-6 weeks after the application has been submitted. The applicant must at all times obtain the required financial information and keep it in their file.


## Implications for Dutch Traders and Investors

The treaty allows Dutch traders, executives and specialized employees to enter the US with the E1 or E2 visa. The E1 visa is for traders whereas the E2 visa is for investors.
