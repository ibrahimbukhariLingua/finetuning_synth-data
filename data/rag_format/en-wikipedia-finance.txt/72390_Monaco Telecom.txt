## Corporate responsibility

For several years Monaco Telecom has spearheaded initiatives to measure electromagnetic field intensities to reassure the public that its installations do not pose a health risk. As of November 2010, electromagnetic wave emissions are regulated under Monegasque legislation, itself inspired by the most stringent regulations in the industry, i.e., an electric-field intensity threshold of 6 Volts/metre for radio antenna, television, walkie-talkie, and WiFi emissions, and 4 Volts/metre for mobile-telephone relay antennas. Compliance with threshold values is monitored by the government-run DCE (Direction des Communications Electroniques) during annual measurement campaigns, or whenever new mobile radio frequency emitting equipment is brought into service.
