## Research

Elyès Jouini's research interests are at the crossroads between mathematics, economics and finance. As of January 2019, he is ranked among the top 5% of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc. In his most highly cited article, with Hédi Kallal, Jouini analyses how dynamic securities markets with transaction costs depend on arbitrage, as otherwise the bid-ask spreads would become martingales, which in turn offers a method for determining the investment opportunities available in an economy. Further important research by Jouini (with Clotilde Napp) has dealt with the effect of belief heterogeneity on asset pricing, and vector-valued and law-invariant risk measures (with Moncef Meddeb, Nizar Touzi and Walter Schachermayer).
