## Controversy

In January 2016, following a company loss of KSh270 million (about US$2.7 million) for the half year period from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015, the NOCK board of directors sent the then managing director, Sumayya Hassan-Athmani, on compulsory leave, pending a forensic audit of the company finances. She was re-instated "three weeks later", pending the forensic audit. However, she chose to resign effective 1 July 2016. Mwangi, a holder of Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Nairobi, was confirmed as the chief executive officer at National Oil, effective 1 August 2017.
