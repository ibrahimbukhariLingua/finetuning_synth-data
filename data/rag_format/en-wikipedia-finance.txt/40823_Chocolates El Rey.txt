Chocolates El Rey


# Chocolates El Rey



**Chocolates El Rey** is a Venezuelan chocolate manufacturer. The company uses only premium-grade, locally grown cacao for all of its products. One of the oldest chocolate manufacturers in Venezuela, El Rey is proud to still be a family run business.


## Fair cacao exchange

El Rey offers gourmet chocolate made from fairly traded cacao beans, direct from growers in Venezuela. El Rey has managed to eliminate middlemen, known locally as “Coyotes”, who pay growers the lowest possible price. Aprocao, a democratic cooperative, pays above market prices for cacao. It also teaches growers how to sustainably manage soil, promoting natural cycles without chemicals, and how to ferment cacao to earn the best price.

## Types of Venezuelan cacao

* Criollo: Grown in the foothills of the Venezuelan Andes, the Criollo variety is considered to have the finest flavour and aroma. In Pre-Columbian times it was exported by Spaniards to Central America, the Caribbean and Asia. Today Criollo is in danger of extinction, as it is gradually replaced by higher yielding and more disease resistant varieties. Criollo pods are typically deeply ridged, warty, and with pointed ends. When the Criollo beans are opened, the Cotyledons range from white to shades of pink. When properly fermented, Criollo beans dry to a tan colour and exude a distinctive chocolate aroma. Venezuelan Criollo are highly appreciated by chocolate connoisseurs for their lower levels of bitterness, astringency, and lingering taste.
* **Forastero:** Is located in Western and Central Amazonia. The Cacao Forastero is a sturdy, disease-resistant Amazonian cacao. When cut open the cotyledons have a deep purple colour. This pigment is given by substances that impart a bitter, acid, and astringent flavour to the Forastero beans. Today, Forastero is the cacao of choice in the large commercial cacao plantations of Africa, Asia, and Brazil.
* **Trinitario:** Is Born in the island of Trinidad from the crossing between Forastero and Criollo cacao. Since the eighteenth century, Trinitarios has been grown in Eastern Venezuela and sells at a premium in the cacao market.
