In 2008, a series of online casino and poker TV adverts from InterCasino were banned by the United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority because they were deemed as using juvenile and slapstick humour that could appeal to young people and children.

InterCasino's parent company at the time, Online Interactive Gaming Entertainment, defended the adverts, describing them as using "gentle slapstick humour reminiscent of old-fashioned routines by Charlie Chaplin or Benny Hill" and, as such, not designed to appeal to children or young persons.
