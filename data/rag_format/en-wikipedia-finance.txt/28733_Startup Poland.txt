The **Startup Poland** Foundation (Polish: *Fundacja Startup Poland*) is a Polish think tank and a non-governmental organization established to raise awareness of the economic potential of startup companies among the public administration, and to represent the Polish startup community in the regulatory processes.

The organization was set up by a group of local entrepreneurs, lawyers, researchers, and investors. Since April 2020, the Foundation is directed by the chief executive Tomasz Snażyk.


## The Foundation's goal

The purpose of Startup Poland is to identify and eliminate systemic barriers in Polish law and administration, which limit the rapid growth and development of young companies, as well as to promote regulation and recommend activities that stimulate technology entrepreneurship. These activities are to help create a legislative and administrative environment in Poland to support the development of innovative projects with global reach. This in turn is to contribute to the acceleration of GDP growth by creating jobs and stopping the process of talent drainage.

Startup Poland works on developing the local technological entrepreneurship and startup-financing infrastructure. The foundation also represents the interests of Polish technology entrepreneurs in the dialogue with the public administration, the European Union institutions, corporations, and the academic community.


### Program postulates

On April 22, 2015, at the European Economic Congress in Katowice, the Foundation presented its program declaration that calls out the main barriers and challenges facing Polish startups:

* promoting the culture of investing in startups by creating conditions favorable to the emergence of strong market ventures;
* conducting consultations with the public sector on legal changes to support the development of the startup ecosystem, which would result in the selection of the most useful and scalable projects;
* providing citizens with more data collected in public offices;
* creating the position of the Chief Technology Officer of the Polish administration, or the proxy for technological innovation at the government and local-government level, the person deciding on the direction of the use of modern technologies;
* increasing the attractiveness of the Polish economy for entrepreneurs and specialists from outside the European Union, by creating a simple and transparent system for granting visas;
* introducing entrepreneurship lessons in schools with trained teachers supported by practitioners;
* introducing effective incentives to create programs for educating technology entrepreneurs, run by venture capital funds and local communities;
* developing simple procedures for the transfer of public funds and better mechanisms for distributing financial resources from the European Union to investors who offer not only financial but also substantive support;
* introducing favorable tax mechanisms – changes in provisions of a joint-stock company and limited joint-stock partnership, modeled as a convertible debt, and enabling the use of the option pool in a limited-liability company and joint-stock company – legal forms suited to selling their shares as part of equity crowdfunding – which would significantly increase the interest of business angels in investments in young, innovative enterprises in Poland;
* creating a support system and procedures for startups investors – as a directory of through API-provided services, used in all offices, at every level of administration.

## Foundation's history

A group of several dozen entrepreneurs from rapidly developing small and medium technology enterprises was involved in creating the organization which would integrate and represent the interests of the young and dynamic Polish businesses.

The appointment of the coalition was initiated by Borys Musielak, the founder of the coworking center Reaktor, along with Michał Juda and Jan Stasz. The three was backed by 150 startup founders. The Polish Internet pioneer Piotr Wilam, and Konrad Latkowski joined the council of the Foundation, while mentors Rafał Brzoska and Michał Brański were appointed to the program council. In November 2014, the Foundation's program declaration was presented. And in April 2015, the Foundation selected its president Eliza Kruczkowska, who in October 2016 was succeeded by Julia Krysztofiak-Szopa. Since April 2020 the president is Tomasz Snażyk.
