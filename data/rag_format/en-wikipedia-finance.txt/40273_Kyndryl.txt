## History

Officially formed in late 2021, Kyndryl was created from the spin-off of IBM's infrastructure services, and comprises the bulk of the former IBM Global Technology Services. At year-end 2020, the spin-off had a portfolio of around 4,400 customers, including 75% of the Fortune 100. The company was given the name Kyndryl in April 2021, with "Kyn" referencing "kinship" and "Dryl" referencing "tendril". On November 4, 2021, Kyndryl completed its separation from IBM and began trading as an independent company on the New York Stock Exchange, with Martin Schroeter as chairman and CEO. Kyndryl operated in 63 countries in November 2021, and managed around 400 data centers. By November 2021, Kyndryl had also partnered with Microsoft to provide digital transformation services using Microsoft Cloud products. In December 2021, Kyndryl partnered with Google Cloud on digital transformation projects as well. Kyndryl announced new reporting segments for its finances in January 2022. Kyndryl partnered with Amazon Web Services in February 2022, and in October 2022, Kyndryl and Microsoft created a data pipeline between Microsoft Azure and Kyndryl's zCloud platform. In 2022, as ranked by revenue, *CRN* placed Kyndryl No. 6 on its list of largest IT solution providers in North America. On September 28, 2023, the *Financial Times* quoted sources saying that Kyndryl was separating its Chinese arm, saying the decision was influenced by increased tensions between the United States and China. On 13 May 2024, Kyndryl announced the acquisition of Skytap and the divesture of Securities Industry Services to Broadridge Financial Solutions, as part of a portfolio optimization action.
