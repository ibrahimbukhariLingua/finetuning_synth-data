# Enter Air



**Enter Air S.A.** is a Polish charter airline with its head office in Warsaw, Poland, and main base at Warsaw Chopin Airport and Katowice Airport. It operates holiday and charter flights out of its hubs in Poznań, Katowice, Gdańsk, Warsaw and Wrocław.


## History

On 25 April 2010, Enter Air completed its inaugural flight from Warsaw to Enfidha. The airline cooperates with major tour operators in Poland (including Rainbow Tours, TUI, Wezyr, and Itaka) and operates mainly from Poland to popular holiday destinations such as: Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Egypt, and Tunisia. Its low-cost model helped it grow over 300% between 2010 and 2012, despite the rising fuel prices and the events in Tunisia and Egypt (Q1 2011), which made some airlines reduce their fleet or even disappear from the market.

Enter Air Group is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange since its IPO on 14 December 2015. The company shares are traded with a ticker symbol ENT.
