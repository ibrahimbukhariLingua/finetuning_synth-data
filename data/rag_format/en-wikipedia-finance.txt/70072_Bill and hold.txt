# Bill and hold



A **bill and hold** transaction occurs when a company recognizes revenue before delivery takes place. Normally a revenue is not recognizable until goods are delivered or services are rendered. Exceptions are made when a customer specifically requests that the vendor delay delivery and has a legitimate business reason for the request.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
