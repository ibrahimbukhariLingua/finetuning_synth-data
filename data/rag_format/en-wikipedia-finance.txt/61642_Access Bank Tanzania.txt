The coordinates of the bank's headquarters are 06°48'38.0"S, 39°17'10.5"E (Latitude:-6.810556; Longitude:39.286250).


## History

In 1996, the company started business operations as an asset financing institution. At that time, the shareholders included CDC Capital Partners (CDC), International Finance Corporation (IFC), **Tanzania Development Finance Company Limited** (TDFL) and the Union Dominions Corporation (UDC). UDC subsequently merged with First Merchant Bank and BARD Investment Services, and thereafter re-branded as "African Banking Corporation". The bank in Tanzania was granted full commercial banking status by the Bank of Tanzania in 2002, under the name **African Banking Corporation Tanzania** (**BancABC Tanzania**). BancABC operated as a merchant bank since 2002 and introduced retail banking operations in 2008. In 2004, the ABCH Group acquired 68 percent shareholding in TDFL, with the Government of Tanzania retaining the remaining 32 percent ownership. The international shareholders, including IFC, CDC, DEG, FMO and EIB were paid off.

In June 2024 Access Bank Group, acquired a majority stake in the bank, buying out the shareholding formerly own owned by Atlas Mara Limited. The transaction was concluded in Q3 2024 and BancABC Tanzania rebranded to Access Bank Tanzania. It is expected that the owners will merge the bank with the parts of Standard Chartered Tanzania that they are in the process of acquiring.
