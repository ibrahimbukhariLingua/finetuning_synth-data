Qantas Frequent Flyer


# Qantas Frequent Flyer



**Qantas Frequent Flyer** is the frequent-flyer program of Australian flag carrier Qantas. Points are accrued based on distance flown, with bonuses that vary by travel class. Points are earned through members flying on Qantas, Oneworld and other partner airlines. Points can be redeemed for flights or upgrades across these airlines. The program also offers options to earn and redeem points through non-airline partners across the hospitality, retail, banking, insurance, energy, wellbeing, technology, motoring and entertainment sectors in Australia, New Zealand and other countries. As of 2024, It has over 15 million members worldwide, including about 50% of the Australian population, making it Australia’s largest loyalty program, around 20% of the New Zealand population, as well as members from other countries around the world.

To join the program, customers living in Australia or New Zealand pay a one-off joining fee, and then become a Bronze Frequent Flyer (residents of other countries may join without a fee). All accounts remain active as long as there is points activity (earning and/or spending) once every eighteen months. Flights with Qantas and selected partner airlines earn Status Credits — and accumulation of these allows progression to Silver status (Oneworld Ruby), Gold status (Oneworld Sapphire), Platinum and Platinum One status (Oneworld Emerald).


## History

Qantas Frequent Flyer was launched in 1987.

Qantas has faced criticism regarding availability of seats for members redeeming points. In 2004, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission directed Qantas to provide greater disclosure to members regarding the availability of frequent flyer seats.

In March 2008, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase suggested that the Qantas frequent-flyer program could be worth A$2 billion (US$1.9 billion), representing more than a quarter of the total market value of Qantas.

On 1 July 2008 a major overhaul of the program was announced. The two key new features of the program were Any Seat rewards, in which members could now redeem any seat on an aircraft, rather than just selected seats — at a price. The second new feature was Points Plus Pay, which has enabled members to use a combination of cash and points to redeem an award. Additionally, the Frequent Flyer store was also expanded to include a greater range of products and services.
Announcing the revamp, Qantas confirmed it would be seeking to raise about A$1 billion in 2008 by selling up to 40% of the frequent flyer program. However, in September 2008, it stated it would defer the float, citing volatile market conditions.

In December 2008, Woolworths and Qantas entered into a six-year agreement to allow Everyday Rewards members to earn Qantas Frequent Flyer (QFF) points for purchases at Woolworths Supermarkets. In June 2009, details of the arrangement were announced. Under the arrangement Everyday Rewards members would earn one Qantas Frequent Flyer point for each dollar over $30 spent in one transaction at Woolworths (or Safeway) supermarkets (excluding Tasmania) or Woolworths liquor stores. To earn these points Everyday Rewards members would need to also have and link a QFF account, and the QFF joining fees were waived for new QFF members. Woolworths was to pay the QFF program for QFF points earned by members under the arrangement.

The program was later expanded to include some of Woolworths Limited's other stores including Big W and BWS. From October 2009, cardholders could collect one point per dollar for every dollar over $50 spent in one transaction at Dick Smith and Tandy, however those stores' participation stopped in September 2012.

In August 2009, of 3.8 million Everyday Rewards cards "registered", 1.2 million were linked to a QFF account, which increased by August 2010, to 5.1 million cards registered, of which 2.7 million were linked to a QFF account.

On 26 October 2015 Woolworths announced it is splitting with Qantas to revamp its Everyday Rewards Program. This will see many members of this reward card lose their unredeemed Qantas Frequent Flyer Points.

On 15 December 2015, Woolworths Rewards announced a new partnership with Qantas Frequent Flyer giving customers the choice to convert their Woolworths Dollars, earned through buying orange ticket products, into Qantas Points at a conversion rate of 870 Qantas Points for every 10 Woolworths Dollars.

On 22 August 2016, Woolworths Rewards announced that members would now have additional redemption options, including converting their savings to Qantas Points.

On 1 October 2019, Woolworths Rewards increased the rate at which points are converted to Qantas Frequent Flyer points. Instead of 2,000 Woolworths Rewards points converting to 870 Qantas points, this increased to 1,000 Qantas points. Upon reaching 2,000 Woolworths Rewards points, those points would now be converted within 24 hours (rather than in blocks every 3 months).

In January 2024, Qantas announced future changes to its Frequent Flyer program, namely an increase in the points required for many Classic Flight Rewards from August 2024. The update marked a notable shift in redemption rates for members.
