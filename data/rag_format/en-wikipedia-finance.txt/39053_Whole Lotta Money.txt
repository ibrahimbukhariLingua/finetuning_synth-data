## Nicki Minaj remix

On July 9, 2021, Bia released a remix of "Whole Lotta Money", featuring American rapper Nicki Minaj.


### Background and release

According to *Rolling Stone,* "when Nicki Minaj heard “Whole Lotta Money,” she liked it so much that she reached out to the rapper on Instagram." A day prior to the song's release, Minaj went on social media to announce she would be on Instagram Live the following day to announce something very important. On the night of release, she went live with Bia to announce the release of the "Whole Lotta Money" remix.


### Critical reception

CedricCed gave "Whole Lotta Money" a B rating. According to him, "the album version without assistance from an already established rapper is much more worth listeners’ time". He added that "BIA is future-proof in the rap game if she succeeds in sustaining the momentum reached from the feature with Minaj".

*The Musical Hype* rated the song 4 out of 5 stars. According to him, "BIA, assisted by the ever risqué and unapologetic Nicki Minaj drop a surefire, addictive banger. It checks off the boxes with ample personality from both rappers, confident, compelling rhymes (even being shallow), and hard-nosed, minimal production."
