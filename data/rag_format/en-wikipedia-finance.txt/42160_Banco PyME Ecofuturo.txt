# Banco PyME Ecofuturo



**Banco Pyme Ecofuturo S.A.** is a Bolivian financial institution that originated from Ecofuturo S.A. Private Financial Fund, founded in 1999. Ecofuturo was established through the collaboration of four Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) dedicated to supporting the development of micro and small enterprises in Bolivia.


## History


### 1999 – Beginning

Ecofuturo S.A. began its operations during a challenging period for the Bolivian economy, from 1999 to 2002, amid a national macroeconomic crisis. Despite initial financial difficulties, the institution achieved financial stability and sustainable growth in the following years.


### 2008 – primary shareholder

In 2008, shareholder IDEPRO transferred all its shares to Fundación para Alternativas de Desarrollo (FADES), making FADES the primary shareholder of Ecofuturo.
