A **commercial mortgage broker** acts as an intermediary who brokers mortgage loans on behalf of businesses or individuals who needs a commercial loan. The loan is provided by the commercial lender securing a commercial property of the borrower. In developed mortgage markets like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and United Arab Emirates, mortgage brokers are the largest sellers of mortgage products for lenders.

Some commercial mortgage brokers offer loans but most of them do not provide commercial mortgage loans. A commercial mortgage broker is often used to connect the borrower with potential lenders, obtain multiple quotes, and to manage the financing process.


## Fees

Some brokers charge a fee to the lenders, and others take commission, which they receive from the lenders whom they introduce to borrowers.
