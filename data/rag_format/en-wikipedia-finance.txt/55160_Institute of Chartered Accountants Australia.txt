The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia was formed with the granting of a Royal Charter on 19 June 1928, to Thomas Brentnall, George Mason Allard and Henry Joshua Wise on behalf of the public accountants of Australia.

On 26 October 1929 The Earl Marshal of England granted the current arms to the institute. The arms include the Latin motto 'Nec Timens Nec Favens' which translates to 'Without Fear or Favour'.

The Institute now operates under a Supplemental Royal Charter (amended from time to time) granted by the Governor-General on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II on 19 August 2005.
