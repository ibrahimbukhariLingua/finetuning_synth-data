# Greencross



**Greencross** is an Australian pet care company. It operates the Petbarn, City Farmers and Greencross Vets chains in Australia. It jointly owns the Animates chain in New Zealand with EBOS Group. Founded in 1994 by veterinarian Glen Richards, the company went public on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2007 before being purchased by TPG Capital in 2019.


## History

Greencross was founded in 1994 by veterinarian Glen Richards. While practicing companion animal medicine and surgery in Townsville, he purchased Currajong veterinary hospital. This was the start of Greencross.

The company expanded by purchasing and consolidating veterinary services through Australia and went public on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2007, becoming the first veterinary practice in Australia to do so.

In June 2013, Greencross acquired the Pet Cemetery & Crematorium in Greenbank for $1.45 million. In 2014, Greencross acquired Mammoth Pet Holdings, the parent of the Petbarn chain in Australia and the Animates chain New Zealand.

In February 2019, it was announced that TPG Capital would purchase Greencross and take it private for A$675 million in cash and scrip.

In February 2022, TPG sold a 45 per cent stake in Greencross to AustralianSuper and the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.

In April 2023, Greencross acquired Habitat Pet Supplies, a Melbourne-based pet store chain with five stores. Greencross plans to merge it with its Petbarn business.

In late 2023, EBOS Group attempted to purchase Greencross for A$3.75 billion. However, the deal was called off after weak demand from EBOS's investors to fund the takeover.
