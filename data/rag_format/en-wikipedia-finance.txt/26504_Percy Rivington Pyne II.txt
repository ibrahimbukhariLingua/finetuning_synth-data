# Percy Rivington Pyne II



**Percy Rivington Pyne II** (May 5, 1857 – August 22, 1929) was a banker, financier, and philanthropist.


## Early life

Pyne was born on May 5, 1857 in New York City, the son of Percy Rivington Pyne I (1820-1895) and Albertina Shelton (née Taylor) Pyne (1833–1900). His maternal grandfather was Moses Taylor, founder of the First National City Bank of New York and a stockholder in the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. His older brother, Moses Taylor Pyne, inherited much of the family fortune and was a major benefactor of Princeton University.

Pyne received a B.A. degree from Princeton in 1878 and an M.A. degree in 1881.


## Career

He began his business career under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather, Moses Taylor, serving as a partner in the firm of Moses Taylor & Co. He would follow in his grandfather's footsteps, becoming director of the National City Bank as well as manager of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad.

From 1903 to 1922, Pyne also served as treasurer of the New York Zoological Society.


### Residences

In New York City, Pyne and his family lived at 680 Park Avenue at the corner of East 68th Street, now home to the Americas Society. In 1899, he built the mansion Upton Pyne in Bernardsville, New Jersey, as a summer home. It was named after Upton Pyne in Devon, England, his family's ancestral manor. It was the largest mansion in the area until it was torn down by his daughter in 1982.


## Personal life

On June 20, 1889, he married Maud Howland (1866–1952), daughter of New York merchant Gardiner Greene Howland. Maud's brother Dulany Howland married Marguerite McClure, who later remarried Ogden Haggerty Hammond, the father of Millicent Fenwick. Together, Percy and Maud Pyne had five children:
