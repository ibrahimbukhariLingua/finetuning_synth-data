## Research

In January 2011, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), a state agency created by voters with Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Act, released an independent economic impact study authored by BRG professionals. The report showed that the first $1.1 billion in grants created 25,000 job years and $200 million in new tax revenue through 2014. Taxpayer funding generates 2,739 jobs annually.

Special Advisor Dr. Laura D'Andrea Tyson and directors Dr. Kenneth Serwin and Dr. Eric Drabkin performed "The Benefits for the U.S. Economy of a Temporary Tax Reduction on the Repatriation of Foreign Subsidiary Earnings," a 2011 economic study commissioned by the New America Foundation. The study assessed the effects of a one-time reduction in the tax rate applied to the repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings on spending, output, and employment in the U.S. economy. The study found that a temporary reduction to approximately 5.25 percent would lead to a significant increase in repatriations, making $942 billion available for domestic use by U.S. multinational corporations.

In 2013, the same authors published "Implications of a Switch to a Territorial Tax System in the United States: A Critical Comparison to the Current System." Citizens for Tax Justice wrote that the study "flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that today many of these profits are really earned in the U.S. but characterized as 'offshore' in order to obtain existing tax benefits that would be expanded under a territorial system."

In 2022, BRG published several articles: “Estimating the Benefits from Collaboration: The Case of SEMATECH” by David Teece, which was cited in the Economic Report of the President, "ESI Triage Distribution in U.S. Emergency Departments” by Nicholas Chmielewski, which was published in *Advanced Emergency Nursing Journal*, “International Trade and the Survival of Mammalian and Reptilian Species" by Michael A. Williams et al., which was published in *Science Advances**,* and *Assets and Finances: Calculating Intellectual Property Damages, 2022-2023 ed*. by Cleve Tyler, Greg Smith, and Deepa Sundararaman, which was published by Reuters.

In 2023, David Ab h r, Neal Brody, Robin Cantor, and Dubravka Tosic published “Emerging Areas of Group and Class Actions Related to ESG Disclosures,” in ICLG *Class and Group Actions Laws and Regulations 2023.*

## Reception
