## History

Personio was founded in 2015 by Hanno Renner, Jonas Rieke, Roman Schumacher and Arseniy Vershinin, all of whom had studied at the Technical University of Munich. The company emerged from a program of the Center for Digital Technology and Management. The cloud-based software was primarily used by other start-up companies in the early days, and was thus able to cover a market niche. Personio's software is provided for a subscription payment and can simplify or completely automate processes in the area of human resource management.

In October 2021, Personio announced a new round of financing in the amount of $230 million. Investors included various venture capitalists from the United States such as Greenoaks Capital Partners, Altimeter and Alkeon Capital. In June 2022, Personio announced another series E funding round of $250 million.
