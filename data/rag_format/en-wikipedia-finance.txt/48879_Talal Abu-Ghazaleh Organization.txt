# Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization



The **Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization (TAG-Org)**, is an international holding company that operates out of more than 100 offices worldwide in the Arab region, Africa Europe, Asia and North America.

The organisation is a leading provider of professional services having established a total of 60 member firms and societies since its inception, in addition to being an affiliate of the World Bank, the Register of Accountants and Auditors (Washington) and the UN Center for Transnational Corporations (UNCTC).
TAG-Org is mostly noted for its role in supporting Arab innovators through promoting the concept and relevance of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in Arab countries during the seventies, particularly with the formation of Abu-Ghazaleh Intellectual Property (AGIP) in 1972, and later the Arab Society for Intellectual Property (ASIP) in 1987.

The company produced the electronic encyclopedia Tagepedia in 2013 which now increased its number of entries to 1,200,000. However, it is not a free encyclopedia like Wikipedia.
(see register.tagepedia.org).
