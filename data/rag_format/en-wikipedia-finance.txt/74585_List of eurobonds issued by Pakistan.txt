In March 2006, the Government of Pakistan selected Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and JPMorgan to manage a new international bond issuance valued at $500 million.

In May 2021, Water and Power Development Authority, an organization administered by the Government of Pakistan, issued $500 million eurobond at a coupon rate of 7.5 percent to fund the construction of Diamer-Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam.
