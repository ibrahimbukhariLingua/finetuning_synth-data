## Charges against him

In 2019, the Guatemalan Prosecutor's Office and UN-backed International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) filed impeachment proceedings against him for alleged attempts between 2012 and 2015 to influence votes in the Guatemalan legislature in favor of Tigo, the telecom company he worked for. CICIG was expelled from Guatemala by president Jimmy Morales after his brother and son were also named in cases of corruption rendering moot its role in the complaint. In August 2019, an Investigative Commission of the Guatemalan Congress recommended not to proceed with the impeachment and let Valladares retain immunity.

On January 15, 2020, Valladares Urruela submitted to a court in Guatemala and on January 16 the prosecutor's office raided his home in an attempt to arrest him. On January 28, Valladares Urruela issued a statement arguing charges were motivated politically.

Valladares Urruela was charged in August 2020 by the Miami, Florida US Federal Court of helping launder close to $10 million, including illegal drug proceeds, as part of a network involving corrupt politicians and a “crooked bank employee”. Valladares Urruela appeared before court in October and hearing was set for January 2021.

In a previous FBI criminal complaint he was accused of using cocaine profits to make the bribery payments but did not plead guilty to that allegation. On 7 July 2022 Valladares Urruela pled guilty in Miami federal court to transferring $350,000 in bribery payments and receiving $140,000 as part of the money laundering scheme, and agreed to cooperate with the U.S.'s Attorney's Office.
