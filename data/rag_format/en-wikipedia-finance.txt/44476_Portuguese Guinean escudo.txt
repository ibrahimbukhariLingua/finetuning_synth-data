Portuguese Guinean escudo


# Portuguese Guinean escudo



The **escudo** was the currency of Portuguese Guinea between 1914 and 1975. It was equal to the Portuguese escudo and replaced the real at a rate of 1000 réis = 1 escudo. The escudo was subdivided into 100 *centavos*. Portugal issued banknotes (starting in 1914) and coins (starting in 1933) for use in Portuguese Guinea. Following independence, the peso replaced the escudo at par.


## Coins

In 1933, coins were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 centavos and 1 escudo. Coins of 2+1⁄2, 10 and 20 escudos were added in 1952, with 5 escudos coins introduced in 1973.


## Banknotes

In 1914, notes were issued by the Banco Nacional Ultramarino in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 centavos. In 1921, larger denominations, from 1 escudo up to 100 escudos, were introduced. 500 escudos notes were first issued in 1945, with 1000 escudos notes introduced in 1964.
