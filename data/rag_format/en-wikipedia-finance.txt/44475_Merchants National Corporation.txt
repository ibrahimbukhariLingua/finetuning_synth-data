Merchants National Corporation


# Merchants National Corporation



**Merchants National Corporation** (MNC) was an Indianapolis-based statewide bank holding company that was one of the largest Indiana-based financial institutions at the time it was acquired by Ohio-based National City Corporation in 1992. Its primary subsidiary was the Indianapolis-based **Merchants National Bank and Trust Company**, which had been founded in 1865.

From the mid-1950s through the late 1980s, Merchants National Bank and Trust, American Fletcher National Bank, and Indiana National Bank, were the three largest banks in Indianapolis. Their holding companies—Merchants National Corporation, American Fletcher Corporation, and Indiana National Corporation (later named INB Financial Corporation)—were the three largest bank holding companies in the state.


## History

To allow it to acquire other banks and other financial related businesses, Merchants National Bank & Trust Company formed a holding company named Merchants National Corporation in January 1972.


### Expansion outside of Marion County

Until July 1, 1985, the state of Indiana did not permit bank branching across county lines nor bank ownership outside the bank holding company's home county. After that date, Indiana allowed very limited branching, but did allow the purchase of banks by holding companies anywhere in the state as long as total deposits that were controlled by a holding company did not exceed a ceiling which was initially set at 11 percent of all deposits held in Indiana banks.

MNC made its first expansion move outside of Marion County by announcing in June 1985, one month before the new cross-county bank laws went into effect, the pending acquisition of the Shelbyville-based Farmers National Corporation and its Farmers National Bank subsidiary for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition was completed in January 1986.
