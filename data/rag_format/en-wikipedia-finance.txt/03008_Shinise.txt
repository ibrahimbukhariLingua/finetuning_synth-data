Shinise


# Shinise



***Shinise*** (老舗, lit. 'old shop(s)') are Japanese businesses that have been in operation for at least for a hundred years, some more than a thousand years. Japan has significantly more very old businesses than any other country, and *Shinise* products enjoy a particular prestige in Japan.


## Characteristics

Long-established companies are particularly common in Japan, which is home to over half of the world's companies that are older than 200 years. As of 2020, the country had more than 33,000 *shinise*, of which 3,100 were older than 200 years, 140 older than 500 years and at least 19 who say that they have been operating for over 1,000 years. *Shinise* are a source of national and regional pride, and are the subject of governmental promotion, business management books and travel guides.

Frequently, *shinise* are relatively small family businesses guided by a particular set of principles (*kakun*). These principles tend to emphasize continuity, tradition, longstanding business relationships, sticking to the core business, accumulating cash reserves and avoiding debt and other risk. This limits growth but helps the companies weather even severe crises. Some *shinise*, however, have grown to be leading players in their fields, such as the video game maker Nintendo or the general contractor Takenaka.

The prevalence of *shinise* in Japan is attributed to the particularities of Japanese culture, such as reverence for traditions and one's ancestors, and Japanese history, such as the country's relatively long global isolation prior to the 19th century. To ensure familial continuity, *shinise* owners without children of their own sometimes adopt one of their male employees. One effect of the high prestige that *shinise* enjoy in Japan is that startups are less respected or appreciated than elsewhere.


## *Shinise* products

Buying something from a *shinise* imparts particular prestige in Japan, connoting the "pinnacle of taste". This Japanese preference for *shinise* is distinguished from the appreciation most societies have for luxury goods in that it does not only include expensive, long-lasting items such as cars and watches, but also everyday objects and food.

This consumer preference may have roots in Japanese society's predilection for conformity, which makes it so that somebody who owns a *shinise* item is certain not to be ridiculed for it, and frequently respected. As a result, brand loyalty to *shinise* is often intense, which in turn helps these companies survive for a long time.
