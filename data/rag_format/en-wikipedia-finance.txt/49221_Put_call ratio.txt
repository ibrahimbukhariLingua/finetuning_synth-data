Put/call ratio


# Put/call ratio



In finance the **put/call ratio** (or put-call ratio, PCR) is a technical indicator demonstrating investor sentiment. The ratio represents a proportion between all the put options and all the call options purchased on any given day. The put/call ratio can be calculated for any individual stock, as well as for any index, or can be aggregated. For example, CBOE Volume and Put/Call Ratio data is compiled for the convenience of site visitors.


## Readings

Generally, a lower reading (~0.6) of the ratio reflects a bullish sentiment among investors as they buy more calls, anticipating an uptrend. Conversely, a higher reading (~1.02) of the ratio indicates a bearish sentiment in the market. However, the ratio is considered to be a contrarian indicator, so that an extreme reading above 1.0 is actually a bullish signal and vice versa.

The lowest level of the index was 0.39x, set in March 2000 at the peak of the dot-com bubble.
