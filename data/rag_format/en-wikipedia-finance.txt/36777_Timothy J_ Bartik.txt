# Timothy J. Bartik



**Timothy J. Bartik** (born March 26, 1954) is an American economist who specializes in regional economics, public finance, urban economics, labor economics, and labor demand policies. He is a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

He developed a method of isolating local labor demand changes that is referred to as the Bartik instrument. This measure averages national employment growth across industries using local industry employment shares as weights to produce a measure of local labor demand that is unrelated to changes in local labor supply. This is a key tool in macroeconomic analysis.


## Biography

Bartik earned a B.A. degree from Yale University (magna cum laude) in 1975 and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1982.

Prior to joining the Upjohn Institute in 1989, Bartik was assistant professor of economics at Vanderbilt University (1982–1989), and legislative assistant for housing and urban policy for U.S. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. (1975–1978).

Bartik is also the son of groundbreaking computer programmer Jean Bartik.


## Research

Bartik's research includes work in the following areas:

* wage subsidies and public service jobs to promote job creation
* state and local economic development policy
* early childhood programs as a means of economic development.

Bartik is also the creator of the "Panel Data on Incentives and Taxes database", a free online tool that offers the most comprehensive information available to date on incentives to business for economic development provided by state and local governments in the United States. Accompanying the database is a report (and detailed appendices) that explains how the database is constructed while offering preliminary analyses that begin to answer questions about how incentives vary.
