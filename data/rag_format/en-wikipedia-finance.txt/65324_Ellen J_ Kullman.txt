## Controversy

In October 2019, Kullman responded to accusations that in her role as CEO of DuPont, she inappropriately delegated DuPont's environmental liabilities to a spin-off company, Chemours. DuPont incurred environmental liabilities as a result of contaminating drinking water with Perfluorooctanoic acid, a chemical which is harmful to humans and the environment, and is known to be the cause of multiple diseases in humans and animals, including cancers and birth defects, and has resulted in cancer in 2,507 individuals living in Wood County, West Virginia.

On March 26, 2018, Kullman's alma mater Tufts University announced they would be awarding her an honorary degree. In the weeks leading up to graduation, this was met by University-wide outrage.
