The album peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard 200 and reached the second spot on the R&B albums chart. The album was certified platinum in September 1992.

Adam Greenberg of AllMusic gave the soundtrack a mixed review, stating that "the album is a perfect blend for a fan of the early-'90s R&B sound, but doesn't really meet the same standard as music of later years."
