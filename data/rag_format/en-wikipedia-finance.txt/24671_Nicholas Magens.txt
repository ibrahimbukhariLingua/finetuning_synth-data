Esq. **Nicholas Magens** or **Nicolaus Paul Magens** (1697 or 1704–1764) was an attorney, a merchant specializing in Spain and her colonies in America, and an expert on ship insurance, general average and bottomry who gained a great reputation in commercial matters.


## Life

Nicolaus was born Neuendorf bei Elmshorn in the Duchy of Holstein. Around 1725 he lived in Cadiz and traded with Veracruz where silver from New Spain could be bought. Already in 1737 he was living in London and became a citizen when he married Elizabeth Dörrien and by royal assent; his younger brother Wilhelm settled in Cadiz. In 1741 he became one of the directors of the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation and was given the responsibility for the complaint negotiations by the Hamburg Senate. In 1759 he seems to have been appointed by the Bank of England as director. After the Anglo-Prussian Convention, he and George Amyand were involved in two bills of exchange, to support the Duke of Brunswick. They collaborated with Henry Fox, 1st Baron Holland, Paymaster of the Forces and Adrian and Thomas Hope. In 1763 he moved to Brightlingsea, where he had bought two manors, which were inherited by his nephew Magens Dorrien Magens.

His huge monument was sculpted by Nicholas Read.
