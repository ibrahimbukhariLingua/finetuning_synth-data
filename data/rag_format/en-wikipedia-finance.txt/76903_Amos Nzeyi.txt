## Temangalo Saga

In 2008, Nzeyi and Ugandan Security Minister Amama Mbabazi sold a parcel of land measuring 464 acres (1.88 km²) at a price of US$12,000 per acre to the National Social Security Fund of Uganda (NSSF). The total price was US$5,568,000.

Subsequent inquiry into the transaction, commonly referred to as the Temangalo Saga, discovered irregularities in the transaction. Both the managing director of the NSSF and his deputy were sacked because of this transaction. In a subsequent cabinet reshuffle, Minister of Finance Ezra Suruma, whose ministry was responsible for supervising and approving the transaction, was dropped from the cabinet.

As of March 2010, the saga had not yet been resolved. 272 acres (1.10 km²) of the land in question, including one of the personal residences of Nzeyi that sits on that land, had yet to be transferred to NSSF, despite having paid for it in 2008.
