# Eavor Technologies



**Eavor Technologies Inc.** (/ˈɛvər/ EV-ər) is a global geothermal technology company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. The firm was founded in 2017 with the goal of producing a scalable form of baseload energy.

The main difference between traditional geothermal and Eavor-Loop™ is scalability. Traditional geothermal energy systems rely on specific geological conditions, such as the presence of naturally occurring hot underground aquifers, to extract heat for energy generation. These conditions are relatively rare, limiting the global applicability of traditional geothermal technology. The Eavor-Loop™, in contrast, is an Advanced Geothermal System (AGS), or a closed-loop system, designed to operate independently of such geological constraints, offering the potential for broader scalability in diverse locations.

A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) describes these advancements as innovative next-generation geothermal technologies due to their reservoir-independent approach. These technologies have the potential to expand geothermal power generation and direct-use heating to regions where conventional geothermal resources are unavailable.


## Technology


### Eavor-Loop™

The Eavor-Loop™ differentiates Eavor’s technology from conventional or Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). This closed-loop system acts as a subsurface reverse radiator, where a working fluid circulates through a series of multilateral wellbores and extracts heat from hot rock via conduction. The system brings thermal energy to the surface, which is used for commercial direct heat application or converted to electricity with a power generation module (heat engine).

The working fluid circulates autonomously through a natural difference in density, where cold, dense water sinks in the inlet well, and hot, less-dense water rises in the outlet well. This is known as the thermosiphon effect. This mechanism enables energy extraction without mechanical pumps, effectively eliminating parasitic load.


### Rock-Pipe™

Rock-Pipe™ is a patented innovation that creates a proprietary chemical seal between the circulating water and the surrounding rock. This seal ensures that the fluid remains within the system, preventing seepage into the subsurface and maintaining complete independence from the surrounding geology.


### Magnetic Ranging

Adapted from the energy services sector, Magnetic Ranging Technology enables Eavor to pinpoint precise well intersections at target depths and connect its closed-loop system. This technique utilizes magnetic signals exchanged between bottom hole assemblies (BHAs) to guide the drilling process, enhancing accuracy in subsurface operations.


### Insulated Drill Pipe (IDP)

Insulated Drill Pipe (IDP) is important in advancing hotter and deeper geothermal projects. This technology transforms conventional drill pipes into tools capable of regulating bottom-hole temperatures. IDP serves two essential purposes: actively cooling standard drilling equipment to enable operations under immense temperatures and enhancing drilling speed for greater efficiency.


### Dispatchability

The energy collected within an Eavor-Loop™ can be dispatched according to the consumer’s energy needs. The system can slow down and even pause its flow, allowing the working fluid to pick up additional energy by staying longer within the hot rock. It can then be brought to the surface as a higher-temperature fluid.


### Multilateral Junctions and Whipstock

Near the bottom of the vertical section of the Eavor-Loop™, junctions are created to facilitate the drilling of multilateral extensions. The direction of the drill bit is precisely controlled using a whipstock, a guiding tool inserted ahead of the drill bit. The whipstock ensures the bit navigates accurately through the designated junction, enabling the creation of multiple lateral branches from a single vertical well.


## Environmental Impact

The AGS system has unique environmental benefits:

* **Clean, renewable energy**: Provides an on-demand, 24/7 energy source without producing emissions.
* **No water use**: Eliminates brine production, minimizes water usage, and removes the risk of aquifer contamination.
* **No fracking**: Operates independently of subsurface aquifers, avoiding the need for fracking and the risk of induced seismicity.
* **Low surface footprint**: The system, which covers many kilometres, operates underground, with only a power plant visible at the surface.

## Projects


### Eavor-Lite™

The Derek Riddell Eavor-Lite™ Demonstration Facility is near Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, and it served as a full-scale prototype showcasing Eavor’s technology. Construction and drilling began in August 2019, and the facility was decommissioned in late 2024.

The facility featured two vertical wells connected by two multilateral wells at a depth of 2.4 km, with a surface pipeline linking the system. Although not designed for commercial use, the project aimed to demonstrate key elements of Eavor’s technology at minimal cost.

The project was divided into three operational phases: drilling, surface pipeline and facility construction, and testing. Its technical goals included successfully drilling and connecting a multilateral Eavor-Loop™ with dual laterals, sealing the loop during drilling, and validating the system's thermodynamic performance, including the thermosiphon effect.


### Eavor-Deep™

Eavor-Deep™ is a test site in New Mexico, USA, that successfully drilled the hottest and deepest directional geothermal well in history, showcasing its proprietary technology and the components needed for commercial Eavor-Loops™ in deep, high-temperature rock. The demonstration project aimed to showcase the results of Eavor’s patented technology and open new opportunities for Eavor-Loop™ projects in the U.S., European, and Asia-Pacific markets.

Drilling started in August 2022 and finished December 2022, reaching a depth of 18,000 feet (TVD) with temperatures around 250°C. Key achievements included meeting depth and temperature targets, improving bit life and penetration rates in granite, and isolating permeable zones with casing to allow deeper drilling into low-permeability basement rock, sealed with Rock-Pipe™ technology.

Other accomplishments included demonstrating the performance of insulated drill pipe (IDP) with enhanced penetration through shock cooling, executing a cased-hole side track in granite, and steering accurately in hard rock with complex intrusions and interbedded metamorphic formations.


### Geretsried

The project in Geretsried, entitled “Eavor-Europe,” is Eavor’s first commercial geothermal power plant in Germany. The plant will feature a drilling depth of approximately 4,500 meters and is designed to deliver an electrical output of around 8.2 MW and a thermal output of approximately 64 MW. Once fully operational, it is expected to reduce CO₂ emissions by about 44,000 tonnes annually.

The plant was inaugurated in August 2023, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder in attendance. The European Union supports and finances the project.

The facility aims to supply district heating to 20,000 homes in the region. Both heat and electricity are expected to be fully operational by 2027. A heat supply contract has been established to establish long-term energy delivery to the region.


### Sonoma Clean Power

In March 2023, Eavor signed a cooperation agreement with Sonoma Clean Power to develop up to 200 MWe of geothermal energy through the GeoZone initiative in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties, California. The GeoZone is a public-private partnership aimed at expanding local geothermal capacity by partnering with private companies that provide the necessary technology and funding.

The GeoZone initiative focuses on three key objectives: developing geothermal resources with minimal water usage, ensuring compatibility with community land-use values, and creating a scalable, cost-effective energy solution.


### Hanover

Eavor signed a heat supply agreement with municipal energy supplier enercity in September 2023 to deliver up to 30 MW of power annually to the district heating network. Using Eavor-Loop™ technology, the project will provide 250 million kilowatt-hours of heat, enough for 20,000 homes.


### Tilburg

Eavor’s project in Tilburg, Netherlands, has secured approval from the SDE++ program. The 2023 SDE++ round awarded nearly €1.4 billion in subsidies to ten geothermal projects expected to cut over 0.5 megatonnes of CO2 annually. Eavor's project is part of a broader plan to expand geothermal energy in North Brabant, addressing geological data, financial risks, and heating network optimization.
