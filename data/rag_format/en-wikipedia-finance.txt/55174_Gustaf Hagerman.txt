## Career

Hagerman began venturing into business through a relative of his Predbjörn Blanxius, with whom he trained to become a trader of raw materials. Upon his death, Blanxius left Hagerman his business, which at the time included mostly trading of grain. In 1798 he earned trading rights through his partnership with Jöns Peter Hemberg, and in 1802 he started his own company. Thanks to the continental system, Ystad profited greatly during the early 19th century, and so did Hagerman's business, which grew in range of products traded, including: spices, tobacco, tea, wine, iron, tools, paper, and tapestries. In 1930, Hagerman, together with Jöns Peter Hemberg, and Gustav Berghman, founded Skånes Enskilda Bank, in which he was a board member 1831–1839. The bank grew to become the largest private bank in Sweden during late 1800s.
