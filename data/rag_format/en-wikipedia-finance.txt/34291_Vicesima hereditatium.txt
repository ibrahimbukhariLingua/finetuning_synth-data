Vicesima hereditatium


# Vicesima hereditatium



The ***Vicesima hereditatum*** was a Roman 5% tax on inheritance money.


## History

No inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The *vicesima hereditatum* ("twentieth of inheritance") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicatedâ€”from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source, but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign.
