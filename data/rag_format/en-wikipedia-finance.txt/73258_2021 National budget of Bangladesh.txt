## Controversy

After allocating ৳15054.03 crore (US$1.3 billion) to the Ministry of Religious Affairs under the ADP for the next fiscal budget, on 29 May 2021, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council expressed discontent and issued a press statement terming the allocation as "a continuation of sharp discrimination against minorities" over the allocation of ৳290.08 crore (US$25 million) for religious minorities under the Annual Development Programme (ADP) of the proposed budget in the upcoming fiscal year. ৳200 crore (US$17 million) was first allocated in 2017. The organisation demanded an allocation of ৳5000 crore (US$430 million) to eradicate the discrimination minority communities have been facing over the years. They also demanded a separate ministry for religious minorities similar to India and Pakistan.

On 19 June 2021, Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahajote's secretary-general Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, at Dhaka Reporters Unity, demanded the construction of at least one model temple in each of the upazilas across the country, a separate election system for the Hindu community, keeping 60 reserved seats for Hindus, the formation of a ministry for minority communities, appointing a cabinet minister from the minority community, and allowing a one-day government holiday to observe Rathajatra.
