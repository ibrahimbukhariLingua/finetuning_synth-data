The loans were more than 25 percent of the capital base of Janata Bank in violation of banking rules. The loans were provided from the Janata Bhaban corporate branch under manager Md Abdus Salam Azad, who would later become the managing director of the bank. The loans were approved by the board of directors led by chairperson Abul Barkat and managing director SM Aminur Rahman. Shaikh Md Wahid-Uz-Zaman, who was the chairman from December 2014 to 2017, blamed the board of directors and management of the bank for the loans to AnonTex Group. AnonTex Group restructured their loan with a 1-2 percent payment rather than the customary 10-15 percent payment needed for restructuring. Bangladesh Bank had provided Janata Bank permission ignore overexposure rules for providing loans to Galaxy Sweaters and Yarn Dyeing, a subsidiary of AnonTex Group.

Bangladesh Bank sought an explanation of the loans to AnonTex Group from managing director of the bank, Md Abdus Salam Azad. The group had laundered the money outside of Bangladesh using false invoicing of capital machinery. The loans were provided following an approval letter by Mizanur Rahman Akon, deputy general manager of Bangladesh Bank, without approval of Financial Integrity and Customer Services Department.

Anti-Corruption Commission had found Crescent Group embezzled money from Janata Bank while Customs Intelligence and Investigation Directorate reported that the group had laundered the money out of Bangladesh. Bangladesh Bank stopped Janata Bank from re-hiring Syful Shamsul Alam & Co as its audit company because it had found the company aided Crescent Group in embezzling money from the bank. Janata Bank was fined by Bangladesh Bank for providing undue favors to Beximco Group.

In 2016, Rajib Hasan, a senior officer of the bank embezzled 19.3 million taka from client accounts.

In 2018, the government sought to appointed Hedayetullah Al Mamun as chairman of the bank but reverse course following backlash against the appointment. The government instead appointed Luna Shamsuddoha, the first woman to head a state-owned bank in Bangladesh.
