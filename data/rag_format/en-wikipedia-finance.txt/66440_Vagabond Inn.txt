## History

In 1958, Vagabond Motor Hotels, Inc, a California corporation, opened its first hotel in California: the first Vagabond Inn. It was geared towards the value-conscious leisure and business travelers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

For 50 years, Vagabond Motor Hotels, Inc. extended the Vagabond Inn brand on the West Coast: with hotels in California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1994, Vagabond Motor Hotel, Inc. and Imperial Hotel Corp. merged and flagged all Vagabond Inn properties, and continued expansion on the West Coast.

The success of this collaboration led to the launch of Vagabond Inn Corporation, which is now owned by Vista Investments. The franchising gives the Vagabond Inn brand the opportunity to expand more quickly and in more locations.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In an effort to better meet the needs of the cost-conscious business traveler, Vagabond Inn introduced Vagabond Inn Executive. Although it offers the same value and hospitality of all the locations, the Executive locations also provides business travelers with added amenities.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
