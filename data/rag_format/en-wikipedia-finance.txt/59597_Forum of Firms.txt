Forum of Firms


# Forum of Firms



The **Forum of Firms** (FOF, Forum) is an association of international networks of accounting firms that perform transnational audits.

The objective of the Forum is to promote consistent and high-quality standards of financial reporting and auditing practices worldwide. The Forum brings together firms that perform transnational audits and involves them more closely with the activities of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) in audit and other assurance-related areas. It was established in 2002. Theo Vermaak is the chair of the Forum The Transnational Auditors Committee (TAC) is a committee of IFAC and the executive arm of the Forum, and, therefore, provides the official linkage between the Forum and IFAC. The Transnational Auditors Committee is chaired by Wally Gregory.
