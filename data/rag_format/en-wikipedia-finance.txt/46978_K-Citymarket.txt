## History

The first Citymarket store was opened in the neighbourhood of Paavola in the city of Lahti year 1971. The name Citymarket came from the City-Otra department store in Tampere, which Kesko partly owned. Kesko opened seven Citymarket stores in the 1970s and in the 2020s there were over 80 stores in big and medium sized stores across Finland.

The first Citymarket in the Baltic countries was opened year 2001 in Riga. In the end of the year 2002 there was four Citymarkets in Estonia and two Citymarkets in Latvia. Year 2004 Kesko and ICA formed the Rimi Baltic company and all the K-Citymarkets (together with ICA-stores) were changed to Rimi Baltic stores. Kesko sold its part of the Rimi Blatic company to ICA year 2006.
