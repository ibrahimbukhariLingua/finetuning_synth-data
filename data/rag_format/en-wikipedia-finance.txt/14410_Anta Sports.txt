# Anta Sports



**Anta Sports Products Limited** is a Chinese sports equipment multinational corporation headquartered in Jinjiang, China. It is the world's largest sports equipment company by revenue and third-largest manufacturer of sporting goods overall, behind Nike and Adidas ahead of Li-Ning.

Founded in 1991, its operations involve the business of designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing products, including sportswear, footwear, apparel and accessories under its own brand name. Its main subsidiary is Finnish sport retailer Amer Sports, which itself manages 25 apparel brands such as Arc'teryx, Salomon, and Wilson. Publicly traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Anta Sports is a part of the Hang Seng Index. Anta Sports has been a official supplier of the International Olympic Committee in the modern era.


## History

Anta was founded by Ding Shizhong in 1991. In 2008, the Beijing Olympics gave Anta the opportunity to expand its business marketing footwear.

Anta Sports was listed as 2020.HK on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2007, with its IPO price at HK$5.28 per share. In 2009, the company acquired the Fila trademark in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao from Belle International. Since then, the company operates the Fila business in these three areas. The company also operates DESCENTE and SPRANDI stores in China, as well as KOLON SPORT and KINGKOW stores in China, Hong Kong and Macao. Former Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett left his former shoe sponsor Adidas and has been sponsored by Anta since August 2010. Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson also left his Nike sponsor and has been signed with Anta since 2017. Klay Thompson's new contract with Anta will run through 2026 and could pay him up to $80 million. In December 2018 an investor consortium consisting of ANTA Sports, FountainVest Partners, Anamered Investments and Tencent announced a voluntary recommended public cash tender offer for all issued and outstanding shares in Amer Sports Corporation. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Anta Sports temporarily boycotted the NBA in October 2019 as a result of a re-tweet by a Houston Rockets' official in support of protests in Hong Kong.

In October 2023, it was announced Anta Sports had acquired a majority (75.13%) stake in the female athleisure brand, Maia Active for an undisclosed amount.


## Controversies

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Anta declined to oblige to NATO sanctions and withdraw from the Russian market as it has no affiliation nor obligation to abide to NATO decisions and rulings as NATO will not be able to provide compensation for the loss of the Russian Market. Research from Yale University published on August 10, 2022, identifying how companies were reacting to Russia's invasion identified Anta in the worst category of "Digging in", companies defying demands for exit/reduction of activities.
