News-Transcript Group


# News-Transcript Group



**News-Transcript Group**, based in Framingham, Massachusetts, United States, was a newspaper publisher in eastern Massachusetts, overseeing three daily newspapers and several weekly newspapers before being bought by Fidelity Investments in 1995 and dissolved into Community Newspaper Company the next year.


## History

The group was formed in 1986 when Harte-Hanks bought Transcript Newspapers Inc. of Dedham, Massachusetts, merging it with the *Middlesex News*. Later that year, Harte-Hanks bought Century Newspapers and combined its operations with News-Transcript. In the mid-1990s, as Harte-Hanks divested its newspaper holdings, the company announced in 1994 that it would sell the 14-newspaper chain to Fidelity Investments.

The purchase price was not disclosed, but was estimated at US$30 million to US$40 million. When the sale was complete in 1995, Fidelity made News-Transcript a division of Community Newspaper Company, which became the second-largest circulation publisher in Massachusetts, with 766,000 weekly copies.

News-Transcript—known within CNC as Middlesex Community Newspapers—was dissolved in early 1996, when CNC realigned its operating units by geography, assigning the News-Transcript papers to new Metro, Northwest and West units.


### Northeast Group

Harte-Hanks bought the *Middlesex News* in 1972, establishing its "Northeast Group" of newspapers, which included three *Town Crier* weeklies in towns neighboring the *News*' core coverage area of Framingham and Natick, Massachusetts. The *News*, a 40,000-circulation daily, gave Harte-Hanks—and later CNC—a mid-sized daily newspaper to serve as a flagship for scattered weeklies and smaller dailies.

Northeast Group added the 79-year-old *Wellesley Townsman* October 1, 1985, bought from owner Robert Linnell. The purchase was part of a push into the affluent suburb by the *Middlesex News*, which also debuted a new edition of the daily paper there.


### Transcript Newspapers Inc.

The publisher of two smaller daily newspapers, Transcript Newspapers Inc. was owned for years by Wisconsin publisher Post Corporation. The papers' typesetters organized a long and at times violent strike in 1980, alleging unfair labor practices. Eleven reporters and editors at the Waltham paper were fired for refusing to cross a picket line; in all, about 60 Transcript employees were laid off for striking.

Between August 1984 and March 1986, the company was sold four times: to Gillett Communications in 1984; then to Thomson Newspapers that December; in April 1985 to William Dean Singleton (head of MediaNews Group)—and eventually, in 1986, to Harte-Hanks.


### Century Newspapers

Harte-Hanks' purchase of Century Newspapers in mid-1986 added six weeklies to News-Transcript Group, in suburbs north and west of Boston. Two of the newspapers remain part of Community Newspaper Company today: *The Arlington Advocate* and *The Winchester Star*.

By the time Fidelity bought the newspapers, the *Belmont Citizen* and *Belmont Herald* had merged, the *Watertown Sun* had closed, and the *Newton Transcript* had merged with Northeast Group's *Newton Graphic*.

The merger of the two Belmont papers was controversial. They had competed for 50 years when Century, publisher of the *Citizen*, bought the less newsy *Herald* from publisher John Martin Jr. in early 1986. The *Herald*'s editor, Robert Mead, urged Belmont residents to boycott his former paper, as the two "competitors" began collaborating their coverage and sharing staff, although initially they continued to publish separate editions.


## Properties

At the time of its sale to CNC, News-Transcript Group consisted of three daily and 11 weekly newspapers, all in Massachusetts (the papers' owners before 1986 are listed in parentheses):

* *Daily Transcript* of Dedham (flagship of Transcript Newspapers)
* *Middlesex News* (daily) of Framingham (flagship of Harte-Hanks' Northeast Group)
* *News-Tribune* (daily) of Waltham (Transcript)
* *The Arlington Advocate* of Arlington (Century Newspapers)
* *Belmont Citizen-Herald* of Belmont (Century; was two papers)
* *Needham Chronicle* of Needham (Transcript)
* *The Newton Graphic* of Newton (Century and Transcript; was two papers)
* *Parkway Transcript* of Roslindale, in Boston (Transcript)
* *Sudbury Town Crier* of Sudbury (Northeast Group)
* *Wayland Town Crier* of Wayland (Northeast Group)
* *Wellesley Townsman* of Wellesley (Northeast Group)
* *West Roxbury Transcript* of West Roxbury, in Boston (Transcript)
* *Weston Town Crier* of Weston (Northeast Group)
* *The Winchester Star* of Winchester (flagship of Century Newspapers)

All of these newspapers except the *Newton Graphic* and *Needham Chronicle* are still published by Community Newspaper Company, now a division of GateHouse Media, although the dailies' and Roslindale paper's names have changed. The Newton paper (itself the product of a merger) was merged with CNC's *Newton Tab* after the News-Transcript sale.
