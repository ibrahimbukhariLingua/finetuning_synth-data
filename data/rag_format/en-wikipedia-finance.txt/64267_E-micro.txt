E-micro


# E-micro



An **E-micro** is a futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Globex electronic trading platform, that represents an even smaller fraction of the value of the normal futures contracts than the corresponding E-mini.

Currently, CME offers one E-micro stock market index contract, *E-micro S&P CNX Nifty (Nifty 50) Futures*, with a notional value of $2 x the S&P CNX Nifty index of Indian stocks, and E-micro contracts for a number of currency futures pegged against the US Dollar (AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY). E-micro gold futures contracts were introduced in October 2010.

On 11 March 2019 CME Group announced the launch of Micro E-mini futures on the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The new contracts will be one-tenth the size of existing E-mini futures, and are set to be available for trading in May 2019.
