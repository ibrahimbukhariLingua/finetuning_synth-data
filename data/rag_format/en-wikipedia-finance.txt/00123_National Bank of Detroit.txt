National Bank of Detroit


# National Bank of Detroit



The **National Bank of Detroit** (**NBD**), later renamed **NBD Bank**, was a bank that operated mostly in the Midwestern United States. Following its merger with First National Bank of Chicago, the bank was ultimately acquired and merged into Bank One, at which point the NBD name was discontinued. Today, what was once NBD is owned by JPMorgan Chase & Co.


## History

NBD was founded in 1933 in Detroit in the midst of widespread bank failures during the Great Depression. Spurred by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to help stabilize the nation's banking system, NBD's shares were initially equally owned by General Motors (GM) and by the U.S. government under the RFC. The bank opened for business on March 24, 1933. Charles T. Fisher Jr., of the automobile body manufacturing family became a Director and the President in 1938, serving until his death in 1958 and assisted by Walter F. Truettner as vice-president. By 1945, GM had divested its ownership of bank stock, and by 1947 RFC had ended its involvement in the bank as well.

From 1959 until 1995, NBD was headquartered in the National Bank of Detroit Building (now The Qube).

In September 1993, Charles T. Fisher III stepped down as chairman, president and chief executive officer of NBD Bancorp and was replaced by Thomas H. Jeffs II as president and Verne G. Istock as chairman and chief executive officer.

In 1995, NBD merged with the First National Bank of Chicago; the combined bank was called First Chicago NBD. While NBD was the nominal survivor, the merged bank was based in Chicago. First Chicago NBD later merged with Bank One, which eliminated the NBD name. Bank One was itself purchased by JPMorgan Chase & Co. As of March 2006, most former NBD branches carry the Chase name.

NBD had branches in Toronto and Windsor, Ontario, and overseas in London's Finsbury Circus, in Tokyo, and in Frankfurt.


### NBD Bancorp

Up until the 1970s, retail banks located within the state of Michigan were restricted to building branches within their home counties, but could have a branch office outside their home county only if that branch was located within a 25-mile radius of their main offices. Starting in 1972, the state legislature began to allow the formation of multibank holding companies. To take advantage of this new law, the National Bank of Detroit formed the **National Detroit Corporation** on January 1, 1973 as its holding company. The holding company began to offer stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticket symbol **NBD**. National Detroit Corp. was later renamed **NBD Bancorp** in 1981.

### Merger with First Chicago

On July 12, 1995, First Chicago Corporation and NBD Bancorp Inc. announced that the two companies were planning to merge by swapping stock that was worth $5.3 billion. As part of the deal, First Chicago shareholders would own 50.1 percent of the combined company, while NBD shareholders would own 49.9 percent. Richard L. Thomas, chairman and chief executive of First Chicago, would be chairman of the combined company until May 20, 1996, when he plans to resign. Verne G. Istock, chairman of NBD, would be president and chief executive of the combined company until Thomas steps down and replace Thomas as chairman of the combined company.

The merger was finalized on December 1, 1995 with the formation of the **First Chicago NBD Corporation**. On that date, stock for the new company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "FCN".

Most customers did not see much of a change as a result of the merger except in suburban Chicago where there was branch overlap. This problem was resolved by the closing of 15 former NBD and 9 former First Chicago offices and the rebranding of the remaining NBD offices to the First Chicago brand. Outside of Illinois, NBD branches were left unaffected.

In February 1996, First Chicago NBD sold all of their NBD offices in Ohio to Fifth Third Bancorp.
