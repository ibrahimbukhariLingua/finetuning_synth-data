## Research

Robert Jensen's research concentrates on the microeconomics of international poverty and economic development in relation to a variety of topics such as gender, health, education, fertility and the role of markets and private enterprises. Findings of research conducted by him and his co-authors include the following:

* The adoption of mobile phones by Kerala fishermen and wholesalers dramatically reduced price dispersion and completely eliminated waste by providing ongoing and accurate information on market demand and prices;
* Correcting students' excessively low perceptions of the returns to secondary education by providing them with information is effective in substantially delaying the end of their schooling;
* Introducing cable television may significantly decrease fertility, son preference, and the reported acceptability of domestic violence by exposing communities to information about alternative values and lifestyles;
* Jensen and Nolan Miller find strong evidence for rice being a Giffen good, i.e. a good for which demand decreases as price decreases, in Hunan province;
* Large food price subsidies for two households may not improve and even deteriorate nutrition by allowing consumers to substitute towards foods with higher nonnutritional attributes.
