## History

In 1928, the school was founded on the idea that business and government might become partners in promoting national prosperity and international development. Beginning with a $1 million endowment from The Supreme Council of Scottish Rite Freemasonry Southern Jurisdiction, GW President Cloyd H. Marvin established what was known as the School of Government, with degree programs that integrated business and politics on the national and international levels.

In 1960, the school was renamed the School of Government, Business, and International Affairs. In 1966, President Lloyd H. Elliott split its faculties into a new School of Government and Business Administration (SGBA) and a School of International Affairs—which today bears President Elliott's name. The SGBA was renamed the School of Business and Public Management in 1990. In 2004, it became the School of Business.

Throughout its history, the GW School of Business has attracted leaders from academia, government, and the business world. In 1992, F. David Fowler, a managing partner of KPMG, became dean of the school. He was succeeded in July 1998 by Susan M. Phillips. A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, Dean Phillips brought to the School her expertise in such specializations as derivatives, bank supervision, and financial management.

Shew as succeeded in August 2010 by Doug Guthrie, whose expertise lies in the fields of leadership and organizational change, corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, and economic reform in China. He was succeeded by Dean Livingstone. During her tenure at GWSB, her research was focused on creativity in business organizations. In April 2017, Livingstone left GWSB in order to become President of Baylor University, and Vivek Choudhury replaced her as the interim Dean. In July 2018, Anuj Mehrotra became GWSB Dean.

In January 2006, the GW School of Business opened its new unified complex, the Ric and Dawn Duquès Hall, which was newly constructed, and the renovated Norma Lee and Morton Funger Hall.
