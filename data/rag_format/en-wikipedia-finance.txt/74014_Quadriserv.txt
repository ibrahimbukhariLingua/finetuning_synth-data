Quadriserv


# Quadriserv



**Quadriserv** was a US-based electronic trading platform that helped clients lend and borrow stock for settlement of short sales and other purposes. It was headquartered in New York and was the holding company for its subsidiary, Automated Equity Finance Markets (AQS).

In August 2016, AQS was acquired by Equilend.

QS Holdco sued Equilend and other prime brokers arguing they colluded to drive out AQS. In August 2019, the case was dismissed on the basis that Equilend, in the acquisition, had acquired all rights to take legal action on behalf of AQS. QS Holdco's attempt to amend the complaint was denied, in full, in August 2020.
