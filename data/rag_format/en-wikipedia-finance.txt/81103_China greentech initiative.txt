The **China Greentech Initiative** (**CGTI**) is a Chinese-international open source, commercial collaboration platform. It includes over 100 technology and services companies and over 500 businesspeople focusing on the growth of China's greentech markets. The organization was founded in 2008 by Ellen G.

## The report

The China Greentech Report is a free, annual report published in English and Chinese by the China Greentech Initiative. It is an update of the recent developments in the greentech sector in China. The China Greentech Report 2012 analyses four key factors that characterise challenges and opportunities in China's greentech markets, including:

* How China and global economic forces have impacted greentech growth
* Aggressive government policies will continue to support greentech growth
* Public awareness of urgent environmental problems is growing
* China is going global to satisfy energy security needs and to meet emission reduction goals

## The Partner Program

The CGTI 2012 Partner Program examines opportunities in five sector tracks: cleaner conventional energy, renewable energy, green building, cleaner transportation, and clean water. In addition, CGTI is in discussion with partners interested in launching cross sector tracks which examine opportunities in low carbon zones, waste management, green supply chain, and China outbound markets.
