# Alex Millmow



**Alexander John Millmow** is an Australian economic historian, journalist, and author. Formerly an associate professor at Federation University Australia, he is an honorary research fellow at Australian National University and a adjunct associate professor at Federation, and is president of the History of Economic Thought Society of Australia.

Millmow was an early advocate of increasing economics education in schools because of the decline in practical economic literacy in Australia. He also believes politicians in the 1970s and 1980s acted more boldly than politicians of the 2020s. He has cautioned the Albanese Government that its plans to make the Reserve Bank of Australia completely independent are undermining Australian Labor Party history.
