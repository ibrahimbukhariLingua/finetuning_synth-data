List of companies of Sudan


# List of companies of Sudan



Sudan, officially the **Republic of the Sudan**, is a country in North Africa. In 2010, Sudan was considered the 17th-fastest-growing economy in the world and the rapid development of the country largely from oil profits even when facing international sanctions was noted by *The New York Times* in a 2006 article. Because of the secession of South Sudan, which contained over 80 percent of Sudan's oilfields, the economic forecast for Sudan in 2011 and beyond is uncertain.
