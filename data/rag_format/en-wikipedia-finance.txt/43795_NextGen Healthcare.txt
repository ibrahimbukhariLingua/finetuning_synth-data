## History

Quality Systems, Inc. (QSI) was formed by Sheldon Razin in 1973 in Corona, California, as a dental software company. Sheldon started QSI in his home study with $2,000. It went on to become incorporated in April 1974.

In December 1982, QSI went public through NASDAQ under the symbol QSII.

In 1994, Clinitec was formed by Pat Cline and Bryan Rosenberger to sell software for converting paper medical records into electronic medical records. After acquiring a smaller interest in 1995, QSI purchased the remaining equity of Clinitec in 1996.

In May 1997, QSI purchased Micromed, which provided front- and back office practice management software. In April 1999, QSI combined Clinitec and MicroMed into one operating division to create the MicroMed division, which was later renamed NextGen Healthcare Information Systems division in 2001.

In 2008, NextGen Healthcare then acquired HSI of St. Louis, Missouri, and Practice Management Partners of Hunt Valley, Maryland, to expand its billing services and revenue cycle consulting division.
