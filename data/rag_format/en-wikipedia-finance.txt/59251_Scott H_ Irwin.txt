### Controversy

Scott H. Irwin was blamed, along with Craig Pirrong, by journalist David Kocieniewski for not disclosing ties with the financial industry. He has been paid for consulting services and research by private funding from financial companies. David Kocieniewski adds "Mr. Irwin declined to provide a list of his clients, and the university said its disclosure requirements did not compel him to do so". This report was hugely criticized by financial journalist Felix Salmon for being misleading and unethical. David Kocienewski answered to issues raised by Felix Salmon but the latter found Kocienewski's answers unconvincing.
