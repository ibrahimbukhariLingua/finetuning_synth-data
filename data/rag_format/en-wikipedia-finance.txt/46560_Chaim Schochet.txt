## Lawsuit

In March 2016, PrivatBank Ukraine reduced its stake in PrivatBank Latvia to 46.5 percent removing it from the jurisdiction of Ukrainian regulators. In December 2016, PrivatBank was nationalized by the Ukrainian government which required a $5.5 billion bailout in order to save it from collapse. In 2018, PrivatBank was sold to private investors and in May 2019, the new owners filed a civil lawsuit in Delaware accusing Schochet, Korf, Laber, Boholyubov, and Kolomoyskyi with laundering up to $470 million in monies heavily relying on PrivatBank Latvia as a conduit. Schochet was identified as being the "front man" in an illegal scheme with Optima, which was accused in the lawsuit of "financial crimes and money laundering" involving "hundreds of millions of dollars worth of U.S. assets â€” including major real estate holdings in downtown Cleveland." In 2020, the FBI raided offices of Optima in Cleveland and Miami, in an ongoing investigation. The attorney for Schochet, Korf, and Laber, Marc Kasowitz, stated that the lawsuit is "100% false and defamatory... and is "nothing more than a fictional orchestrated political attack" on his clients who vocally opposed President Trump at the time. Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani commented that it should have been obvious that money laundering was occurring as Optima was overpaying for real estate and then selling at a loss.


## Personal life

Schochet is a practitioner of Chabad Judaism. He is married to Rachel Schechter; they have three children and live in Miami Beach.
