Commercial determinants of health


# Commercial determinants of health



The **commercial determinants of health** are the private sector activities that influence individual and group differences in health status. Commercial determinants of health can affect people's health positively (such as sport or medical industries) or negatively (such as arms and tobacco industries). They are part of the broader social determinants of health.


## Types

Corporate activities influences the legal, physical, and price environments in which people live. For example:

* Political influence (including indirect or grassroots lobbying and direct lobbying) (impeding policy through lobbying such as lobbying against sugary drink taxes, or phasing out tobacco sales to youth);
* Perceptions shaping through marketing (such as when the sugar industry shifted the blame for ill health from dietary sugar to dietary fat and cholesterol), including product design (such as DuPont designing and selling carcinogenic products like teflon cooking pans and other products), packaging and advertising (enhancing the acceptability, such as in the case of Nestle and others selling unhealthy baby formula as better than mother's milk around the world);
* Supply chains (amplifying company influence around the globe);
* Corporate social responsibility strategies such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi funding 96 nutrition charities;
* Labour conditions such as the meat-packing industry's abuse of workers as documented in Upton Sinclair's book The Jungle or in more recent reporting;
* Financial practices (such as crypto and blockchain);
* Funding of science such as when the food industry funded members of the US 2020 dietary guidelines advisory committee.

## Impact

Commercial determinants of health impact a wide range of injuries and noncommunicable diseases (especially cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes). For example:

* Smoking (tobacco industry);
* Air pollution (fossil-fuel industry);
* Alcohol use (alcohol industry);
* Obesity and physical inactivity (food industry);
* Deaths resulting from driving on roads (roads lobby)
* Deaths resulting from weapons (arms industry).

According to *The Lancet*, 'four industries (tobacco, unhealthy food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) are responsible for at least a third of global deaths per year'. In 2024, the World Health Organization published a report including these figures.
