## CTC Communications

CTC became the first reseller of Bell Atlantic services after the Bell System divestiture.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ CTC then took Bell Atlantic to task and court claiming Bell Atlantic had formed a monopoly, the FCC sided on CTC's case clearing the way for the CLEC industry.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In December 2001, CTC pioneered a new technology by placing its first VoIP phone call over a public switching system using their own proprietary technology. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In August 2002, CTC was delisted from Nasdaq and on October 3, 2002 CTC filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. On December 17, 2003, CTC emerged from Chapter 11 and was acquired by Columbia Ventures Corporation. On May 24, 2005, CTC completed its acquisition of Lightship Telecom.

## Choice One Communications

**Choice One Communications** was a Rochester, New York-based CLEC providing Telecommunications services to commercial entities. The company was founded in 1998. The company announced their plan to merge with CTC on February 10, 2006. The merger was completed in July 2006.

In 2005 they became one of the first telephony carriers to introduce the concept of "Dynamic Bandwidth" as an official product. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Dynamic Bandwidth works by transmitting voice and data over a T1 connection using ATM as the underlying protocol. The amount of available bandwidth for data "expands" by 64k for each voice line not in use. When a voice line goes off-hook, the bandwidth reserved for that voice line becomes solely available for use with that line until the call ends, when it becomes usable for data again. Using this concept, a T1 that would normally provide 768k of data and 12 voice lines can provide a full 1.536 Mbit/s connection when no voice lines are in use.
