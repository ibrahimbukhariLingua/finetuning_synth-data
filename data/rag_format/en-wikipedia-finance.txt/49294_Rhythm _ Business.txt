*The Boston Globe* wrote that "the implausibly soulful baritone sax of Stephen 'Doc' Kupka, Castillo's partner since 1969, is highlighted on 'Spank-A-Dang' and 'East Bay Way'." The *Los Angeles Daily News* noted that "Tower of Power has never lost the ability to turn up the heat on slippery funk grooves and soulful ballads."

*The Blade* deemed the album "plain old funk and soul," writing that, "at times, it's like listening in on a jam session as the horns blare and the drums pound." The *Sunday News* called it "a funky soul assembly of churning Hammond organ, snappy chicken-scratch rhythm guitar, ear-bending wah-wah guitar, high-powered thumb-popping funk bass, soaring gospel-tinged soul singing and those nasty, legendary, extraordinary Tower of Power horns." Christina Cole, of the *Anchorage Daily News*, listed the album among the best of 1997.

AllMusic wrote that "these guys know all there is to know about R&B and on *Rhythm & Business* they combine their musical passion, knowledge and abilities into that one-of-a-kind Tower of Power sound."
