## Failure and closure

On August 5, 2011, the Central Bank of Nigeria revoked the operating licence of BankPHB, along with those of Afribank and Spring Bank, as they had not shown capacity to recapitalize before the September 30, 2011 recapitalization deadline.

Keystone Bank Limited was formed on August 5, 2011, by taking over all the assets (including subsidiaries) and liabilities of the now defunct BankPHB, whose commercial banking license had been revoked on the same day.

Following the revocation of the banking licence and takeover of BankPHB, the Nigeria Stock Exchange placed the Group's shares on technical suspension and finally delisted on September 5, 2011.
