## Volkswagen diesel emissions violations

In September 2015, Volkswagen AG's diesel vehicles failed a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation for nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions above the permissible limits. The emissions violations include cars produced by Volkswagen's American division, where Horn is currently CEO. Horn has admitted his company "screwed up" by using the vehicle's software to reduce emissions when it detects an emission testing, but allowing the diesel engines to produce pollutants above the legal limit under normal operating conditions.

On 8 October 2015, Volkswagen US CEO Michael Horn said in testimony before the U.S. Congress that it could take years to repair all the cars, especially the older models, due to the complex hardware and software changes that will be required. He also said that the fixes will likely preserve fuel economy ratings but, "there might be a slight impact on performance". An analyst viewed Horn's performance at the hearing as candid and complete.
