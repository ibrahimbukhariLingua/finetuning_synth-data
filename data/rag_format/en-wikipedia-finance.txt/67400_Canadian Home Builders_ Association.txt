Canadian Home Builders' Association


# Canadian Home Builders' Association



The **Canadian Home Builders' Association** (CHBA) is a not-for-profit organization representing residential construction and related industry firms in Canada. It was founded in 1943, following closely the adoption of the National Building Code of Canada in 1941, and today claims a membership of over 9000. The organization represents member interests to local, provincial and federal governments, and develops positions and solutions to support technical currency and solution pathways for members. Member companies include home builders and renovators, land developers, trade contractors, product and material manufacturers, building product suppliers, lending institutions, insurance providers, and service professionals.

CHBA provides information to new home buyers and home owners to understand processes, planning and regulations surrounding home ownership. CHBA is a resource for locating contractors for new builds or renovations, and working through safety standards, insurance and warranty issues.


## Net Zero Council

CHBAâ€™s Net Zero Energy Housing Council (NZC) stated goal is to support innovation in the industry, creating a market advantage for CHBA member builders and renovators pursuing Net Zero Energy building performance. The Council was established in 2014 as a response to growing interest in energy responsibility from home builders and prospective home owners. The Net Zero program comes out of the previous EnviroHome program established in 1994 as a marketing tool to promote the R-2000 energy efficiency and building waste reduction building standard. EnviroHome promotion was a joint effort by CHBA and TD Canada Trust. The R-2000 program is itself a collaboration between CHBA and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), established as a building standard in 1982 and updated in 2012.
