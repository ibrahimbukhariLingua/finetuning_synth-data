## Early life and education

Priya completed her postgraduate studies at the University of Mumbai. She is also a chartered accountant by education. She is the daughter of Niranjan Hiranandani.


## Career

Priya Hiranandani began her career with Arthur Andersen, a corporate finance firm. In 2000, Priya Hiranandani-Vandrevala founded Zenta Group, a business process outsourcing (BPO) company, which provided services to financial institutions. The company was headquartered in Wayne, Pennsylvania, with operational offices in India. Priya served as the CEO of Zenta.

By 2004, it became one of the largest BPO companies in India, as per NASSCOM. In 2005, she sold Zenta to H-Cube LLC, a US based company affiliated with private equity firm GTCR for US$80 million (then around ₹350 crore), reportedly by Business Standard. However, reports from both *BizJournals* and *Livemint* suggest the sale value to be US$100 million, equivalent to ₹427.9 crores at that time.

In late 2004, Priya took charge of Hiranandani Software and Systems, a software company and she was credited with its successful restructuring. She also served as the chief executive officer of buildbyte.com, which was a construction portal in India with a focus on the e-commerce sector.

In 2006, she co-founded Hirco, a real estate company and served as its CEO until 2010. The company later secured a listing on London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market, with an infusion of £350 million directed towards two projects situated in Chennai and Panvel near Mumbai.

In 2011, Priya Hiranandani-Vandrevala initiated an arbitration case, alleging a breach of a business association agreement by her father, Niranjan Hiranandani and brother, Darshan Hiranandani. The dispute centered around nearly 28 real estate projects valued at approximately ₹3,000 crore. Priya claimed that these projects violated the agreement, which required exclusive transactions between her, Niranjan and Darshan when acquiring and developing land. The arbitration case drew notice for its panel, which included Cherie Blair, wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Ajit Prakash Shah, ex-chief justice of the Delhi High Court and Lucy Reed, a UK Queen's Counsel. In August 2013, London Court of International Arbitration's Indian subsidiary ruled in favor of Priya in the family business dispute with the Hiranandani Group after over two-and-a-half years of arbitration.

In 2016, the Bombay High Court issued an interim directive, ordering Niranjan Hiranandani to pay ₹520 crore in compensation to Priya Hiranandani Vandrevala for breach of trust and infringement of the terms of a business agreement.

At the 2012 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, she chaired the WEF Real Estate Community's Steering Board. In past, Priya was a member of the Indian Merchants' Chamber and served as a representative in its Telecom and IT Committee, advising the Indian government on various IT-related matters. She co-founded Veldos, a BPO business, and H Living Inc, a real estate development company.

She launched the Mental Health - India initiative in 2009, for creating awareness about mental health and providing support services. The foundation has implemented various initiatives, including a free helpline offering confidential counseling and referrals for mental health services.

She collaborated with organizations such as the Gujarat Police, Emmanuel Hospital Association, St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church to promote mental health on various occasions. She serves as a patron of the Elephant Family, a wildlife charity run by Mark Shand and is also a board member of The American School in London. She is a trustee on the University of Pennsylvania Medicine Board.

## Controversies


### Alleged Infringement of copyright and trademark

In February 2014, a legal dispute arose as Niranjan and Surendra Hiranandani, along with Hiranandani Constructions Pvt Ltd (HCPL), filed a suit in the Bombay High Court. They sought to prevent Priya Hiranandani-Vandrevala from using the name 'Hiranandani' in her business, following her establishment of Hiranandani Living Pvt Ltd (HLPL) in May 2013. The petition challenged the name usage and seeking ₹50 crore for the alleged copyright infringement.

In response to objections, HLPL issued a four-page letter, dismissing the claims as false and misleading. Priya, who also owned 10 registered 'Hiranandani' trademarks since 2008, argued the name's generic nature, calling it a common Sindhi surname and HLPL asserted no similarity with HCPL, citing the distinct words 'constructions' and 'living'.


### Defamation case against The Sunday Times

In October 2015, Priya Hiranandani filed a defamation case against Times Newspapers Ltd., the publisher of the British newspaper *The Sunday Times*, for publishing a defamatory and false article related to a legal case involving her company Hirco, in August 2015. The High Court ruled the statements were defamatory, and The Sunday Times settled the claim in November 2016 by issuing apologies online and in print formats and removing the defamatory article from its website.
