# Ministry of Finance (Rhodesia)



The **Ministry of Finance** was a cabinet ministry of the government of Rhodesia. It was responsible for overseeing the nation's public finances.

The Ministry of Finance was established during the colonial period of Southern Rhodesia, first as the office of Treasurer in 1923. The office was renamed as Minister of Treasury from June 1954 to April 1964. The office retained the same structure when Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence in 1965.
