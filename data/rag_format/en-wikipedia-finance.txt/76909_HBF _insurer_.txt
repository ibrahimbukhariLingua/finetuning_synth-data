## History

In 1941, HBF was established as the Metropolitan Hospitals Benefit Fund of Western Australia, with the core purpose of providing affordable health services to Western Australians.
HBF's purpose can be directly traced back to its origins as a key provider of social services prior to the introduction of universal government health cover in Medicare. It was established to provide a pool of funds to ensure the ongoing provision of affordable health services for members. Since its inception, HBF has grown to become the leading provider of health insurance in Western Australia.

In 2009, HBF had 7.7% of the national market share for private health insurance. In 2021, HBF completed the acquisition of Brisbane-based CUA Health Pty Ltd. As of 2021, this increased the company's market share to approximately 8%, with 17% of members living outside of Western Australia. In 2022, HBF acquired Life Ready Physio and in 2023, completed the acquisition of Queensland Country Health Fund.
