Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)


# Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Finland)



**Euro gold and silver commemorative coins** are special euro coins minted and issued by member states of the Eurozone, mainly in gold and silver, although other precious metals are also used in rare occasions. Finland was one of the first twelve countries in the Eurozone that introduced the euro (€) on 1 January 2002. Since then, the Mint of Finland Ltd. have been minting both normal issues of Finnish euro coins, which are intended for circulation, and commemorative euro coins in gold and silver.

These special coins have a legal tender only in Finland, unlike the normal issues of the Finnish euro coins, which have a legal tender in every country of the Eurozone. This means that the commemorative coins made of gold and silver cannot be used as money in other countries. Furthermore, as their bullion value generally vastly exceeds their face value, these coins are not intended to be used as means of payment at all—although it remains possible. For this reason, they are usually named **Collectors' coins**.

The coins usually commemorate the anniversaries of historical events or draw attention to current events of special importance. Finland mints four of these coins on average per year, in both gold and silver, with face value ranging from 5 to 100 euros.


## Summary

As of 2 October 2008, 26 variations of Finnish commemorative coins have been minted: three in 2002, four in 2003, three in 2004, four in 2005, five in 2006, four in 2007, four in 2008 and one in 2009 so far. These special high-value commemorative coins are not to be confused with €2 commemorative coins, which are coins designated for circulation and do have legal tender status in all countries of the Eurozone.

The following table shows the number of coins minted per year. In the first section, the coins are grouped by the metal used, while in the second section they are grouped by their face value.

| This issue commemorates the 200th anniversary of the Finnish War and the Birth of Finnish Autonomy. The Finnish War was fought between Sweden and Russia from February 1808 to September 1809, with Finnish guerrilla troops helping on the Swedish side. As a result of the Russian-won war, the eastern third of Sweden was established as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian Empire. Other notable effects were the Swedish parliament's adoption of a new constitution (also called Swedish Act of Succession) and the establishment of the House of Bernadotte, the new Swedish royal house, in 1818. The motif on the coin is the passage from Sweden to Russia. The same coin depicts both Finnish history, with the withdrawing crown on the reverse side as well as the future of the country, with the eagle symbol on the obverse side. | | | | |

| Friedrich Pacius was a German composer and conductor who lived most of his life in Finland. He has been called the "Father of Finnish music". Pacius was appointed music teacher at the University of Helsinki in 1834. There he founded a musical society, a student choir and an orchestra. In 1848 Pacius wrote the music to the poem *Vårt land* by Johan Ludvig Runeberg, which was to become Finland's national anthem. Pacius's music was also used for the Estonian national anthem *Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm* and the Livonian national anthem *Min izāmō, min sindimō*. He also composed *Kung Karls jakt* (*The Hunt of King Charles*) which was the first Finnish opera. This issue celebrates the 200th anniversary of his birth. The obverse and reverse of the coin complement each other, forming stylized musical notations floating in what reflects a view of a stage. This is the fifth Finnish collector coin in the Eurostar series with the pan-European mint mark. | | | | |
