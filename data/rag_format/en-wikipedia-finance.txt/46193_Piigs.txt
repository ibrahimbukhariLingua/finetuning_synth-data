Piigs


# Piigs



***Piigs*** is a 2017 documentary film by three Italian filmmakers which investigates the causes and the effects of austerity imposed by the European Union on its subject countries, especially in Southern Europe. The film suggests that austerity policies are aggravating the effects of the financial crisis, especially in those countries that economists have called the "PIIGS" (an acronym of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain)â€”states that suffered high public debt and weak economies.
