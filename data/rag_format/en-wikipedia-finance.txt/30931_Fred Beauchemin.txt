## Harassment allegations

On October 5, 2023, Beauchemin and three of his staffers received a complaint for psychological harassment by the president of the Liberal Party of Quebec Youth Commission.

## ChatGPT

On April 6, 2023, he asked the very first question written entirely by artificial intelligence in the National Assembly. It was addressed to innovation Minister, Pierre Fitzgibbon, and focused on the impacts and risks of using this same intelligence.

“I would like to know how the Government of Quebec intends to support this transition to an increasingly digital and automated economy, while ensuring the protection of jobs and the competitiveness of our province. Can you tell us what concrete measures your ministry plans to put in place to encourage the use of artificial intelligence and businesses and industries, while ensuring the protection of workers? Thank you in advance for your answer. And by the way, this question was entirely prepared by ChatGPT”.


## Submission of bill

In March 2023, Beauchemin tabled Bill 396: An Act to amend the Debt Reduction Act and establish the Generations Fund to expect an attainment of capitalization of $100 billion in order to ensure generations a green and prosperous future.
