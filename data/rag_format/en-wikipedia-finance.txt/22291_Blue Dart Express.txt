In 2010–11, it introduced ′cash on delivery (COD)′ to its customers as an additional payment option for its courier services.

Blue Dart is handling almost 8% of India's e-commerce shipments as of 2024. It opened the India's largest, low emission 2.5 lakh sq ft integrated logistics center at Bijwasan, Delhi on January 14, 2025, to improve land and air connections in northern India. The facility can easily integrate with the PM Gati Shakti thanks to its immediate connectivity to the Indira Gandhi International Airport, Indian Railways, metro lines, and national highways. Every day, the integrated logistics hub can handle 550,000 inbound and outbound shipments.
