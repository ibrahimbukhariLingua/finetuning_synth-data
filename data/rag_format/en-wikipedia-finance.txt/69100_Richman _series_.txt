# Richman (series)



***Richman*** (Chinese: 大富翁; pinyin: *Dà Fùwēng*; lit. 'Big Tycoon') is a series of digital board games created and published by Taiwanese game developer company Softstar Entertainment From 1989 to 2022.


## Gameplay

Similarly to the *Monopoly* board game, players must gain the most wealth and/or bankrupt other players as they traverse in a game map, filled with property plots and other special tiles. The goal is achieved mainly by purchasing property and receiving rent from opponents, or investing in a simulated stock market. The gameplay usually also features a selection of minigames, special items, and random events that can change the standings.

In Richman Fight, players need to choose different characters and prepare 8 function cards in repeat deck before starting a game. After the game start, players need to use a dice to control their chosen character in the map and make the opponents bankrupt through the effects of function cards, construct the special property, and release the character's ability. And also players can earn cards or trigger effects in different special blocks on a map to help them win a game.


## History

*Richman 8*, released in 2006, was claimed to be the last main series *Richman* game, as a consequence of "shrinking single-player markets and lack of breakthrough in gameplay". However, spin-off titles including *Richman 4 Fun* for iOS and Android platforms and *Richman WEB* were released after that. A Beijing subsidiary of Softstar has also licensed the development of a mobile-only *Richman 9* to a Hangzhou company.
