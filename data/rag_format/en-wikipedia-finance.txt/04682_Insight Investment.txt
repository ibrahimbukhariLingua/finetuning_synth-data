## History

Insight Investment was launched in 2002. It was formed from the merger of the asset management arms of UK banking group HBOS: Clerical Medical Investment Management, Halifax Fund Management and the investment division of Equitable Life. Douglas Ferrans was Insight's first CEO and played a significant role in its formation and launch.

In 2003, Insight acquired Rothschild Asset Management, which was well known for its fixed income solutions and multimanager funds, and property investment manager Gatehouse Investment Management.

In 2006, Insight demerged its property investment unit and floated it on the Aim market at the London Stock Exchange as Invista Real Estate Investment Management.

In 2007, Abdallah Nauphal became CEO of Insight. He already held a dual role as deputy CEO (from June 2006) and chief investment officer (from September 2003) of the company. He joined Insight as head of fixed income in April 2003 after the acquisition of Rothschild Asset Management, where he was chief investment officer for fixed income. He was previously head of fixed income at Schroder Investment Management.

In 2009, Insight's parent company HBOS was acquired by Lloyds Banking Group (Lloyds). Later that year, BNY acquired Insight Investment from Lloyds. Lloyds retained most of the equity assets managed by Insight and transferred them to Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, the group's primary in-house asset manager after the sale of Insight. This left Insight as an asset manager primarily focused on fixed income and LDI strategies. It transferred its headquarters in early 2011 to share a building with BNY in Blackfriars, London.

In 2012, Insight announced that it would merge with Pareto Investment Management, a currency risk manager with £27 billion of assets under management. The merger was complete at the beginning of 2013. Pareto was also owned by BNY.

In early 2015, BNY acquired US-based fixed income and solutions specialist Cutwater Asset Management.

In 2021, BNY Investments in partnership with Insight Investment announced plans to align Mellon Investments fixed income capabilities with Insight. In September 2021, Insight said c.£76bn of assets in fixed income capabilities across stable value, municipal, efficient beta and taxable fixed income strategies had been transferred to Insight.

In July 2021, Insight Investment was named the asset manager whose brand was most respected in the institutional marketplace. Edelman’s Asset Management Brand Index, which looks at the top 50 international managers in the world by AUM, ranked Insight first with a brand score of 83 (out of 100). In April 2024, Insight was again ranked first.

In January 2025, Insight CEO Abdallah Nauphal announced his decision to retire later in the year, and Raman Srivastava was appointed as CEO designate.
