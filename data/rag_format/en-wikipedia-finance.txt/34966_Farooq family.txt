## Background

The Al Farooq family led by Al Hajj Mohammed Aqil was part of the first wave of migration which started in 1899 due to the "introduction of customs tax by the Persian government under the Qajar dynasty which led to reduced profits for merchants.

Political instability in 1909, and a flu epidemic in 1918 saw the heads of most merchant families from Bastak relocate to the Persian Gulf region, Karachi and the Indian Ocean regions.

After Al Hajj Mohammed Aqil died, his sons Mohammed Farooq, known as The Great Farooq and Ahmed Al Arshi took over as the heads of the family expanding the business internationally and mainly trading in diamonds, pearls and precious stones. As Coles and Jakson put it "The Great Farooq’s generosity and hospitality earned him respect and a reputable status amongst Gulf royalty".

After Mohammed Farooq died, his son Abdulkarim Farooq became the heir to the family. Abdulkarim Farooq was also an advisor to the former rulers across the Persian Gulf.

Abdulkarim Farooq owned a general trading establishment in Al Bastakiya, Dubai known as London store which specialized in importing quality brands directly from London,UK. He was regarded as the "wealthiest man in Dubai and owned symbols of affluence which included a yacht".

The rapidly expanding family business is now a truly global brand through various members of the respectable family amongst which is son of Mohammed Aqil Mohammed Farooq Mohammed Aqil Arshi: Dr. Mohammed Zubair Farooq Al Arshi, a renowned poet and medical doctor.

Family members that currently rule the business including Mohammed Farooq Abdulkarim Farooq, Essa Farooq Abdulkarim Farooq and Rashid Farooq. The family is profoundly known for their ambitious, entrepreneurial and philanthropist stance and work with many international, commercial and Charitable organisations.

Faiqa was born in Paris in 1929, and joined the diplomatic corps of Tunisia due to her Tunisian mother, and was soon posted to Washington as the Third Secretary.
