# Switchwise



**Switchwise.com.au** was an electricity and gas price comparison service website for Australian consumers. The site enabled consumers to compare electricity and gas prices offered by 25 Australian energy suppliers. Consumers could switch their home energy supplier to a cheaper provider by completing an online application. People moving their homes could also arrange for cheaper electricity and gas connections through the site.

Access to the site was free to consumers. The company earned revenue by charging a commission to the supplier to which a customer chooses to switch or connect via the Switchwise website. The company also earned revenue from advertising across the site.

As of June 2019, the company's website indicated it was no longer operational. No reason was given.
