## History

Informatica was founded in 1993 by Gaurav Dhillon and Diaz Nesamoney.

On 29 April 1999, its initial public offering on the Nasdaq stock exchange listed its shares under the stock symbol INFA.

On 7 April 2015, Permira and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announced that a company controlled by the Permira funds and CPPIB would acquire Informatica for approximately US$5.3 billion. On 6 August 2015, the acquisition was completed and Microsoft and Salesforce Ventures invested in the company as part of the deal. The company's stock ceased trading on the Nasdaq effective on the same date.

On 27 October 2021, Informatica again became publicly traded with the INFA stock symbol, this time listed on the NYSE, opening at $27.55 per share.

In June 2023 Informatica acquired Privitar, a data management tool.

In November 2023, Informatica announced a restructuring plan to focus on its cloud offerings. It permanently laid off 10% of its workforce and reduced its office space.

In April 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that Salesforce was in advanced talks to acquire Informatica at a price below its $11 billion market capitalization at the time. The deal was later reported to have been abandoned.
