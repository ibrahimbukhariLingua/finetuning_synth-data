Crony-capitalism index


# Crony-capitalism index



The **crony-capitalism index** is an index published by the British newspaper *The Economist* that claims to calculate whether the livelihood of the people from a certain country or city with a capitalist economy is "easily affected by crony capitalism". It is a measurement of crony capitalism designed based on the work by Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Aditi Gandhi and Michael Walton of Indian think-tank Centre for Policy Research, and others" in 2014.


## Aims

The index aims to be a measuring trend in the number of economic rent-seekers. The assumption behind is because of the favorable political policies set by the government officials, the tycoons are increasing their wealth and interest. As a result, they get a larger part of people's fruits of labor, instead of generating more wealth for the whole society. In some extreme cases, some favored suppliers are influential on the establishment and application of the business-impacting laws and citizens pay the tax for purchasing the overpriced products supplied by the favored corporations.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
