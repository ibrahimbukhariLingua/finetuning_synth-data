Telecommunications in Nepal


# Telecommunications in Nepal



**Nepal's telecommunication network** has increased over the years significantly, with the number of telephone users (both fixed and mobile phone) reaching 40,789,198 as of 14 May 2019.

Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) is the regulatory body of telecommunications in the country. According to the latest figures, eight companies have been licensed to operate voice-based telephony services, out of which five are heavily invested by foreign companies. The investment market of telecom is a subject of interest for many foreign companies and NTA itself as it has to prepare the regulations on hand.

According to the latest Management Information system (MIS) report of the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), 97.65 percent of 26.49 million people in the country have access to telephone service. The report includes data of up to mid-December 2014. Telephone penetration increased by 12.88 percentage points in one year. It stood at 84.77 percent in mid-December 2013.


## History


### The beginning

In Nepal, operating any form of telecommunications service dates back to 1970. However, telecom service was formally provided mainly after the establishment of MOHAN AKASHWANI in B.S. 2005. Later as per the plan formulated in the First National Five-year plan (2012-2017 BS), Telecommunication Department was established in B.S. 2016. In order to modernize the telecommunications services and expand the services, during the third five-year plan (2026 BS), Telecommunication Department was converted into Telecommunications Development Board in B.S. 2026.

After enacting the Communications Corporation Act 2028, it was formally established as a fully owned Government Corporation called Nepal Telecommunications Corporation in B.S. 2032 to provide telecommunications services to Nepalese People. After serving the nation for 29 years with great pride and a sense of accomplishment, Nepal Telecommunication Corporation was transformed into Nepal Doorsanchar Company Limited (NDCL) from Baisakh 1, 2061. NDCL is a company registered under the Companies Act 2053 with an 85% government share. However, the company is known to the general public by Nepal Telecom (NT) as a registered trademark.

Now, there are only two operators, so Nepal's telecom industry is a duopoly market. Other competing telecom service providers like United Telecom (UTL), Smart Telecom are no more in the picture in Nepal.
