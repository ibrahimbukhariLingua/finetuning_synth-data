## History

INSEAD was founded in 1957 by venture capitalist Georges Doriot, Claude Janssen, and Olivier Giscard d'Estaing. Original seed money was provided by the Paris Chamber of Commerce. The school was originally based in the Château de Fontainebleau before locating to its current Europe Campus in 1967. The original name of the school was "**Ins**titut **E**uropéen d'**Ad**ministration des Affaires’ which was later shortened to INSEAD.

In 2000, the school opened a second campus in Singapore, and in 2007, it established a Centre in Abu Dhabi primarily for research and executive education, which later achieved campus status in 2010. In 2020, INSEAD opened the INSEAD San Francisco Hub for Business Innovation.

In 2012, INSEAD joined the Sorbonne University Alliance as a founding member, collaborating with other specialized institutions to contribute to the development of a leading multidisciplinary university.
