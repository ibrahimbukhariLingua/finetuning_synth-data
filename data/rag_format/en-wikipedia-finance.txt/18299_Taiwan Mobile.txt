PEWC also made various business development efforts and tender bids in different wireless licenses in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia and Philippines. The company finally returned to Taiwan to bid for the various licenses being liberalised in 1996 and 1997. Taiwan Mobile now also have acquired stakes in Taiwan Fixed Network [zh].

Ltd which holds the investment in P-Plus Communications Ltd. PEWC, PCC, Pacific Iridium were part of the overall telecom portfolio. The company had also invested into various telecom and internet businesses and had made a series of merger and acquisitions with retail distribution company, a CRM company and an engineering company that receives outsourcing contract from the combined cellular and phone companies.
