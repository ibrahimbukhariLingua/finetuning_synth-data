Upon earning her PhD, Ellram joined the faculty department of purchasing, logistics and operations at Arizona State University's (ASU) W. P. Carey School of Business. During her tenure at ASU, Ellram was recognized as one of 30 "Practitioner Pros to Know" in a list published by *Supply & Demand Chain Executive* for having "a deep breadth of knowledge about the industry and are forward-thinking in their approach to the evolving supply chain network."
