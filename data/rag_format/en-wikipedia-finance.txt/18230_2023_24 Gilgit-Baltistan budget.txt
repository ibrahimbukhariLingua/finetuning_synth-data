## Controversies

During the budget session, there was controversy as members of the opposition voiced their concerns, accusing the GB government of not giving due importance to issues in Gilgit-Baltistan within the present budget. Opposition leader Amjad Hussain Azar specifically criticized the GB government, alleging that they were not efficiently utilizing the funds allocated by the federal government and were instead emphasizing their own benefits in the budget. This criticism resulted in a heated argument between the Chief Minister and the opposition leader; however, they both later expressed regret for their comments.
