### Company history

Argos was founded in Medellín, Colombia on February 27, 1934, by Claudino Arango Jaramillo, Rafael and Jorge Arango Carrasquilla, Carlos Sevillano Gómez, Leopoldo Arango Ceballos and Carlos Ochoa Vélez. In 1936, the factory began production and it issued its first dividend in 1938. After its association with Cementos del Nare, Argos began creating companies in various western regions of Colombia: Cementos del Valle in 1938, del Caribe in 1944, el Cairo in 1946, de Caldas in 1955, Tolcemento in 1972, Colclinker in 1974, and Cementos Ríoclaro in 1982. In the 1990s, Argo purchased stock participation in Cementos Paz del Río.

Argos purchased Corporación de Cemento Andino in Venezuela, in 1998. Subsequently, Argos established alliances to make investments in the Dominican Republic, Panama and Haiti. In 2005, Argos merged all of its cement producing companies in Colombia and purchased Southern Star Concrete and Concrete Express in the U.S. The following year, it purchased Ready Mixed Concrete Company in the US and merged its concrete producing companies in Colombia and then purchased the cement and concrete assets of Cementos Andino and Concrecem in Colombia. In October 2011, Argos purchased the Lafarge operations in the southeastern U.S. adding two cement plants, one clinker grinding, 79 concrete plants and five terminals to the Argos U.S. operation.
