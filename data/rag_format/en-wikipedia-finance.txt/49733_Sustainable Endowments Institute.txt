## Projects


### College Sustainability Report Card

The College Sustainability Report Card, called the Green Report Card, was the first sustainability ranking survey inside higher education. SEI released the College Sustainability Report Card between 2006 and 2012. The sustainability survey collaborated with over 300 schools in North America, sampling colleges and universities in all 50 states and 8 Canadian provinces. The Report Card has been covered in numerous media outlets, including The New York Times, BusinessWeek, Forbes, and CNN Money. The project surveyed administrators, students, and campus community members on 9 sustainability-related categories: administration, climate change and energy, food and recycling, green building, student involvement, transportation, endowment transparency, investment priorities, and stakeholder engagement. SEI supplemented these surveys with publicly available information to assess a grade, from an F to an A, for each institution based on the total number of points earned for each category. The Report Card was indefinitely suspended on March 30, 2012.
