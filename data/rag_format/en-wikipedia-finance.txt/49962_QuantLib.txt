QuantLib


# QuantLib



**QuantLib** is an open-source software library which provides tools for software developers and practitioners interested in financial instrument valuation and related subjects. QuantLib is written in C++.


## History

The QuantLib project was started by a few quantitative analysts who worked at RiskMap (currently StatPro Italia). The first e-mail announcing QuantLib to the world was sent on December 11, 2000, and signed by Ferdinando Ametrano, Luigi Ballabio and Marco Marchioro. RiskMap was founded by Dario Cintioli, Ferdinando Ametrano, Luigi Ballabio, Adolfo Benin, and Marco Marchioro. The people at RiskMap faced the problem, not for the first time in their lives, to build a financial library from scratch. It was Ferdinando's idea to build an open source library that could be used by quants all over the world when starting to build a new quantitative library. Currently, the QuantLib project is headed by Luigi Ballabio and Ferdinando Ametrano.

## Usage

QuantLib is available as C++ source code which is compiled into a library. It is known to work on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other Unix-like operation systems.

It can be linked with other languages via SWIG. The Python binding can be installed via pip; the "RQuantLib" package makes parts of QuantLib accessible from R.

Much of QuantLib's functionality can be used in Excel via the add-in QuantlibXL.
