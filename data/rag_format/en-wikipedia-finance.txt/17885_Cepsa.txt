# Cepsa



**Moeve**, formerly known as **Cepsa**, (*Compañía Española de Petróleos, Sociedad Anónima*, "Spanish petroleum company, S.A.") is a Spanish multinational energy integrated company headquartered at Torre Cepsa in the Cuatro Torres Business Area in Madrid. It operates in several European countries as well as in Algeria, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Brazil, and Panama. The company currently produces around 260,000 barrels per day (41,000 m³/d) and has a refining capacity in three refineries of 21 million tonnes/year.


## History

Cepsa was founded in 1929 as a private company led by Francisco Recasens, with its first refinery located at Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Because of the Campsa state monopoly of fuel distribution, Cepsa sold its production to that company. It expanded to lubricant production in 1950 and petrochemical products in 1955. In 1964 it opened a factory in Portugal, and in 1967 it added a second refinery at San Roque de Cádiz. After relaxations of the state monopoly, Cepsa bought a portion of Campsa petrol stations in 1992.

In 1988, Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) bought a 10% stake of Cepsa. Later Elf Aquitaine bought a 20% stake, and Cepsa became a publicly traded company in 1989. Cepsa bought a third refinery in Huelva in 1991, and entered the liquefied petroleum gas market in 1998. The company expanded to the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Canada, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. In 2011 IPIC bought the full company for 267 million euros.

In November 2013, the firm agreed to buy Coastal Energy Co for around $2.21 billion.

On October 30, 2024, Cepsa oficially changed its name to Moeve, a measure destined to reflect its orientation towards sustainable strategies and low-emitting energy projects.


## Refineries

Cepsa operates 3 refineries in Spain, with 50% ownership of a fourth. Cepsa operates the largest refinery in Iberia, the Gibraltar-San Roque Refinery, which has received significant international criticism for ongoing air pollution problems and increased cancer rates nearby. Cepsa also operates the Refinería de Santa Cruz de Tenerife, La Rábida Refinery, and a 50% split refinery with ASESA.


## Sponsorship

Cepsa has sponsored the Spanish football club Recreativo de Huelva between 1997 and 2007, Spain national football team since 2007 and since 2011 has been one of the major sponsors of the Toro Rosso Formula One racing team until 2015 but not directly supplying fuels and lubricants.
