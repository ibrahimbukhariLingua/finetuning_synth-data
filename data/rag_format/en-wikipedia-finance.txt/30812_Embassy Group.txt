## Controversies


### Embassy REIT

In November 2024, securities regulator SEBI pulled up Embassy Office Parks REIT Ltd for appointing a Aravind Maiya as CEO even though even though he had been found guilty for fraud earlier in the year. After some resistance, to comply with SEBI's order, Embassy REIT eventually asked Aravind Maiya to step down from his position as CEO and instead appointed him as the Head of Strategy. This caused some controversy and the company was thought to have bypassed SEBI's order following it to the letter but not in principle.
