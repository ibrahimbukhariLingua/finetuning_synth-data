Debit spread


# Debit spread



In finance, a **debit spread**, a.k.a. **net debit spread**, results when an investor simultaneously buys an option with a higher premium and sells an option with a lower premium. The investor is said to be a net buyer and expects the premiums of the two options (the options spread) to widen.


## Bullish & Bearish Debit Spreads

Investors want debit spreads to *widen* for profit.

A bullish debit spread can be constructed using calls. See bull call spread.

A bearish debit spread can be constructed using puts. See bear put spread.

A bull-bear phase spread can be constructed using near month call & put.


## Breakeven Point

* Breakeven for call spreads = lower strike + net premium
* Breakeven for put spreads = higher strike - net premium

## Maximum Potential

The maximum gain and loss potential are the same for call and put debit spreads. Note that *net debit = difference in premiums*.


### Maximum Gain

Maximum gain = difference in strike prices - net debit, realized when both options are in-the-money.


### Maximum Loss

Maximum loss = net debit, realized when both options expire worthless.
