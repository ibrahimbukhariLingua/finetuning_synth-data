> Capitalism is under siege, but the HJI believes that it remains the most powerful economic system we have for raising people out of poverty and improving societies. Industry, innovation and enterprise must be anchored by an ethical, responsible and inclusive capitalist system. We started this initiative to foster debate and dialogue about how capitalism can be improved, and to highlight the many excellent efforts of businesses that are taking the lead in the areas that most need improvement. We've already begun showcasing concrete programs that will create a demonstrable impact on the future of capitalism, and we are committed to expanding our efforts in the U.S. and around the world. We hope to include all stakeholders in this effort, from managers to investors to employees to customers and to society at large.

Her third husband was Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (August 29, 1931 – November 7, 2022), whom she was introduced to by Henry Kissinger at the 1998 Bilderberg Group conference in Scotland. They married on November 30, 2000, in London, England, after de Rothschild divorced his wife in 2000. She was his third wife. On the announcement of the marriage, the Rothschild couple were invited to spend their honeymoon at the White House by the Clintons. The couple divided their time between homes in New York and London, a summer home on Martha's Vineyard, and the Rothschild family's historic Ascott country estate in England. By virtue of her marriage to a knight, she is known socially as Lady de Rothschild.

In December 2024, it was reported in The Times that Rothschild was in a new relationship with Maurice Saatchi.


### Epstein link

Rothschild was reportedly friends with disgraced financier and later convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He claimed to have given her financial help in the 1990s during her divorce from Andrew Stein. However, a spokesperson for Rothschild said this was "one hundred percent false." According to Epstein's lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, he was introduced to Epstein by Rothschild, who referred to him as an "interesting autodidact" who he would enjoy getting to know.
