## Products

**Photovoltaic components**

In September 2019, Q CELLS introduced its latest module called Q.PEAK DUO-G9. It combines existing half-cell Q.ANTUM DUO technology with Zero-gap feature, which removes spaces between cells to increase deployment capacity. It launched a consortium with the academics and private entities to develop next-generation tandem cell technology using perovskite.

Its Green Energy Solutions division manages the downstream business. In March 2021,Q CELLS sold an 81-megawatt solar power plant in Texas to US-based solar energy solutions provider Adapture Renewables Inc. The Rippey Solar Project plant is capable of producing electricity for 115,000 people per year.

With Distributed Energy Solutions division, Q CELLS operates an energy retail business in countries like Japan and Germany, where it supplies green electricity from 100 percent renewable sources to households and small-sized companies.

In December 2020, the company raised 1.2 trillion won through rights offerings in an effort to accelerate its expansion into renewable energy. In April 2021, The company issued its first overseas green bonds worth 1 billion yuan.

**Petrochemical products**

Chemical Division produced PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for the first time in South Korea. Including PVC, It also manufacturers other petrochemical products such as LDPE (low-density polyethylene), LLDPE (linear low-density polyethylene), CA (caustic soda), and TDI (Toluene Diisocyanate).

LDPE is a polymer used in a wide variety of applications from daily consumer goods to high-tech industrial materials. In 1972, Hanwha Solutions succeeded in producing LDPE for the first time in South Korea, and are now producing wire and cable compounds, adhesives for hygiene products, and hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
