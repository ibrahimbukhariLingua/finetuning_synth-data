## History

HPCL was incorporated on 5 July 1952 as Standard Vacuum Refining Company of India Limited. In 1974, it changed its name after the takeover and merger of erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India Limited by the Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act 1974. Caltex Oil Refining (India) Ltd. (CORIL) was taken over by the Government of India in 1976 and merged with HPCL in 1978 by the CORIL-HPCL Amalgamation Order 1978. Kosan Gas Company was merged with HPCL in 1979 by the Kosangas Company Acquisition Act 1979.

In 2003, following a petition by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), the Supreme Court of India restrained the central government from privatizing Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum without the approval of Parliament. As counsel for the CPIL, Rajinder Sachar and Prashant Bhushan said that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalized in the 1970s. As a result, the government would need a majority in both houses to push through any privatization.

On 19 July 2017, the Government of India announced the acquisition of HPCL by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).
On 1 November 2017, the Union Cabinet approved ONGC for acquiring a majority 51.11% stake in HPCL. On 30 January 2018, ONGC acquired 51.11% stake, thus gaining majority ownership.
