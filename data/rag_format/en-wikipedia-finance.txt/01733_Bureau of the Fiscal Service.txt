Bureau of the Fiscal Service


# Bureau of the Fiscal Service



The **Bureau of the Fiscal Service** (**Fiscal Service**) is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Bureau consolidates the activities of the previous Bureau of the Public Debt and the Financial Management Service, under the Office of Fiscal Service.

The Bureau manages the government's accounting, central payment systems, and public debt; it serves essentially as the United States Government's checking account and the payment rail for every federal agency. The Bureau acts as the federal government's agent as it interfaces with the various agencies. It also operates the TreasuryDirect website for purchasing Treasury securities.

The Bureau also manages the daily auctions of Treasury Securities, which provide the cash necessary to fund all activities of the United States Government.


## History

The Fiscal Service's roots begin under the Roosevelt administration, beginning in 1939 as a consolidation of all Treasury financing activities into a "Fiscal Service." The Bureau's activities "included accounts, deposits, bookkeeping, warrants, loans, currency, disbursements, surety bonds, savings bonds, and the public debt," consolidating management under a fiscal assistant secretary. By 1974, the agency lost authority over the Public Debt, and was renamed to the Bureau of Government Financial Operations. In 1984, the agency was renamed again to the Financial Management Service.

The Fiscal Service replaced the Bureau of the Public Debt and the Financial Management Service effective October 7, 2012, by directive of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The merger of the two agencies and their data centers saved $415 million. The agency manages the federal government's current and delinquent debt of consumer and commercial accounts and reports the information to credit rating firms.

As of 2017, the bureau may collect any voluntary donations made to the government for reduction of the public debt. Annual donations averaged $2.3 million during the last 26 years prior to 2021. In comparison, the public debt was over $20 trillion as of 2017. The agency also plays a critical role in managing Extraordinary measures during United States debt ceiling crises, such as the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis.

On January 20, 2025, the second Trump administration established the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a temporary organization with Elon Musk as its administrator, and renamed the United States Digital Service to the United States DOGE Service to function as a parent agency.
On January 31, the DOGE team gained access to the U.S. Treasury payment system, administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, after the career Assistant Secretary in charge of maintaining the payment system suddenly resigned. This gave DOGE "full access" to the Fiscal Service's database controlling the expenditure of 6 trillion dollars, as well as "the sensitive personal data of millions of Americans as well as details of public contractors who compete directly with Musk’s own businesses." This read and write access could allow Musk to block payments by the U.S. government to many federal programs. Senator Ron Wyden stated that this access was a "national security risk."
