**Terex Corporation** is an American company and worldwide manufacturer of lifting and material-handling equipment. Terex does business in the Americas, Europe, Australia and Asia Pacific.


## Corporate history

The origins of Terex date to 1933, when the Euclid Company was founded by George A. Armington to build hauling dump trucks. In 1953, General Motors purchased Euclid, expanding the business to include more than half of all U.S. off-highway dump truck sales. Due to a 1968 Justice Department ruling, GM was required to stop manufacturing and selling off-highway trucks in the United States for four years and divest the Euclid brand. GM coined the "Terex" name in 1968 from the Latin words "terra" (earth) and "rex" (king) for its construction equipment products and trucks not covered by the ruling.

General Motors sold the Terex division to German firm IBH Holding AG led by Horst-Dieter Esch de in 1980. After IBH Holding AG declared bankruptcy in 1983, ownership of Terex returned to General Motors and was organized as Terex Equipment Limited (Scotland), Terex do Brasil Limitada (Belo Horizonte, Brazil), and Terex USA (Hudson, Ohio).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

American entrepreneur Randolph W. Lenz purchased Terex USA from GM in 1986, then exercised an option to purchase Terex Equipment Limited in 1987. In 1988, Lenz merged his primary construction equipment asset, Northwest Engineering Company, into Terex Corporation, making Terex the parent entity.

Terex Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1986 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991. As a publicly traded company, Terex grew from acquisitions under the leadership of Ron DeFeo, who became president in 1993 and CEO in 1995.

In 1997 Terex aquired mining business from O&K, including worlds largest hydraulic excavator RH 400, later produced as Cat 6090.
In 2010 Terex sold its mining business to Bucyrus.

In December 2013, Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE) acquired the Terex line of heavy haul trucks.

John L. Garrison, Jr., succeeded him as President and CEO in 2015 and further transformed the business through acquisitions, new-business launches, and divestitures. In January 2024, Terex named Simon A. Meester, formerly President of the company's Aerial Work Platforms business segment, as Terex president and chief executive officer.

In September 2021 VCE rebranded the business Rokbak.

## Criticism

In 1992 American businessman Richard Carl Fuisz reported to the Operations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Agriculture that he witnessed the construction of military vehicles at a Terex owned facility in Scotland in 1987. Fuisz alleged that Terex employees reported that the vehicles were manufactured at the request of the CIA and British Intelligence and were destined for service within the Iraqi military. Terex denied the allegations and, in 1992, filed a libel complaint against Fuisz and Seymour M. Hersh, writer of a *New York Times* article covering Fuisz's allegations. After several investigations, including a 16-month-long federal task force investigation, no legal charges were filed against Terex. *The New York Times*, in an editor's note on 7 December 1995, said, "The article should never have suggested that Terex has ever supplied Scud missile launchers to Iraq, and The Times regrets any damage that may have resulted to Terex from any false impression the article may have caused."
