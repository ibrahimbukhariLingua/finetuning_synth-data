Saul Stone fled persecution in his homeland, Russia, and settled in Chicago in 1921. In 1924, Stone started selling farm wares. Eventually, he moved into hedging futures contracts and dealing in a variety of commodity contracts. In 1938, his firm became a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In 1946 it was incorporated as Saul Stone & Co. Decades later, Saul Stone & Co. merged with Farmer's Commodity Corporation. After the merger, the new company called itself FCStone Group, Inc.
