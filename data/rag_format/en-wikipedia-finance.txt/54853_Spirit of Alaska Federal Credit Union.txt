## History

SoAFCU was originally a small credit union located in the Viking Room of Constitution Hall, University of Alaska Fairbanks. The credit union was started with $32 in a metal cash box and was first named "Greater Fairbanks Teachersâ€™ Credit Union". It was dedicated to non-profit operations for the service and benefit of its member teachers. As the membership grew and expanded to include members north of the Alaska Range, the name was changed in 1975 to "Northern Schools Federal Credit Union". The name was again changed in 2007 to "Spirit of Alaska Federal Credit Union" to reflect the continued expansion of the field of membership and expansive growth of SoAFCU.

SoAFCU opened their newest branch at the corner of Hunter and Johansen in north Fairbanks June 4, 2011.
