## History

Gilbert and Rosenthal worked together at Madrona Venture Group and initially had an idea for making a podcast about company acquisitions that became pivotal to the success of the acquiring company. The first episode discussed Pixar and was published in 2015. Over time, the show expanded beyond the acquisition topic to cover business history more generally.
