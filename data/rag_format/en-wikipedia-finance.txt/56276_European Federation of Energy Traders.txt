European Federation of Energy Traders


# European Federation of Energy Traders



The **European Federation of Energy Traders** (**EFET**) is an association of European energy traders in markets for wholesale electricity and gas. EFET was founded in 1999 in response to the liberalisation of electricity and gas markets within the European Union. EFET advocates policies and regulatory measures which allow electricity and gas trading to develop freely while encouraging good risk management practices and responsible corporate governance. In its role as a standard setting body, EFET aims to provide standard solutions to common aspects of wholesale energy transactions, such as contracting and data exchange.
