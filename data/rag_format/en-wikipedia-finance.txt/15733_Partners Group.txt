## History


### Early history (1996-2010)

Partners Group was co-founded in 1996 by Urs Wietlisbach, Marcel Erni and Alfred Gantner in Zug, Switzerland. Each of the co-founders contributed an equal share to the initial pool in the first year. In the firm's second year it had its first major milestone, launching a US$150 million small & midcap fund focused on investments in German-speaking Europe. The fund was a huge success in mainland Europe. According to Institutional Investor magazine, this is partly due to the lack of competition at the time in Europe compared to North America. In the same article, co-founder Alfred Gantner stated *“you had to explain the term to people because ‘private equity’ in the way we understand it today did not exist, it was called Risikokapital, risk capital, which was associated with venture capital.”*

In 1998, it completed a secondary transaction involving the private equity portfolio of Royal Dutch Shell’s U.S. pension fund for US$265 million. At the time, it was the largest secondary transaction recorded. In 2002, Partners Group was an early investor in Esmertec, a Java client software maker. Partners Group is a joint stock company under Swiss law, listed on the Swiss Exchange since its 2006 initial public offering (minority floating). Around 45% of the shares are held by employees and partners. As of 2016, according to Forbes' annual billionaire's list, founders Gantner, Erni, and Wietlisbach are listed as three of the 25 wealthiest private equity managers in the world, each with net worths totaling $1.3 billion. Since 2001, Partners Group has pioneered evergreen funds in private markets and launched the first European Long Term Investment Fund (ELTIF) in 2017.

Beginning in late 2004, Partners Group made a number of announcements about the opening of new global offices. This began with the Asia Pacific region, with the opening of an office in Singapore in December 2004. The regional office would be responsible for the Asian-focused fund of funds and the investment firm's push into Asia. Christoph Rubeli was responsible for overseeing the expansion. Partners Group Singapore has since become an important regional office for the investment firm, reaching the operational milestone of 20 years in 2024. In March 2005, the investment firm opened its first UK-based office in London due to its growing investor base in the region. Erik Kaas of PG's executive board would manage the UK operations. By 2005, Partners Group had $6 billion in assets under management, and was benefitting from the growing private equity industry. The Financial Times reported that private equity funds had raised $60 billion in first half of 2005 compared with $90 billion for the whole of 2004, demonstrating a growing demand for private equity. Wietlisbach was quoted stating he saw continued growth in the industry as *"generalist funds will struggle to attract new money."* Partners Group reported in its 2007 annual report that the firm had undergone a period of rapid expansion over the previous 24 months. During that time, it has more than doubled its assets under management, employee numbers and its annual net profit figure. Two years after launching its first Asian private equity fund, the firm expanded its presence in Asia with the opening of its Japanese office in the country's capital Tokyo. As an early investor in Swiss-based semi-conductor manufacturer u-blox, Partners Group benefitted when the company announced it would be going public by the end of 2007.

On February 6, 2009, Partners Group announced that Peter Wuffli would be joining its board of directors. Wuffli had previously served as CEO UBS AG until 2007. Partners Group launched the Private Equity Master Fund in 2009. The fund was one of the first to meet the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and one of the first SEC-regulated funds available in the United States. Since its launch, the fund has consistently remained as largest entrant in this sector with US$16 billion in assets in 2024. According to the firm's 2010 Annual Report, total assets under management grew from €17.3 billion in 2009 to €21.4 billion in 2010.

During the same year, MidRail accused Partners Group of violating a non-disclosure agreement, which allegedly impacted the bidding process for acquisition target Patriot Rail. The case was closed in October 2023, after Partners Group and MidRail mutually agreed to dismiss their claims against each other. September 2020 saw Partners Group join the Swiss Market Index (SMI), with its first day of trading on 21 September.

## Management

Partners Group was managed during its early history by the three co-founders, Marcel Erni, Alfred Gantner and Urs Wietlisbach. In more recent years, the founders have all remained as large shareholders and board members, but the day-to-day management is done by the Executive Team. In the late 90s, the three founders introduced a number of changes to boost team morale. This included a one-month paid sabbatical every five years for employees to recharge and regular hikes up Wildspitz, located close to the Partners Group's Zug office. Hikes up Wildspitz are still done today by Partners Group as part of its onboarding process for new employees.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 2021, its CEO Dave Layton received media coverage for banning the word *"deal,"* a move which Layton believed could reduce the transactional mindset often associated with private equity. Senior management that broke the rule, would be asked to donate $1,000.

In 2023, Executive Chairman Steffen Meister documented the ongoing role reversal between private and public markets. In the white paper, Meister was quoted saying *real value creation is rarely about big M&A transactions. Instead, it is about organic growth, platform-building, and research and development.* Robert Collins, Co-Head of Private Wealth at Partners Group, spoke about the growing need for tailored investments for individual investors.

During the same year, Pensions & Investments magazine ran an article about Partners Group and its early adoption of generative AI and how the move was supported by senior executives.
