## Activity and sanctions

Kashanimehr played a key role in facilitating the illicit sale of Iranian oil to generate revenue for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF). As part of this operation, he traveled from Iran to Turkey to collaborate with Behnam Shahriyariâ€™s network, which was responsible for concealing the proceeds from these illegal transactions. Due to his involvement in financially supporting the IRGC-QF, he was designated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on May 25, 2022, under Executive Order 13224, which targets individuals and entities providing material support to terrorist organizations. Following this designation, he was also added to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, maintained by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), effectively freezing his assets and restricting his financial activities.
