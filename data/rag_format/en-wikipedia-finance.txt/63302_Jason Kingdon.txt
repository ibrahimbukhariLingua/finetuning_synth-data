## Education

Kingdon completed his undergraduate degree in pure mathematics at Queen Mary University of London, masters in Mathematical Logic and Theory Computation at the University of Bristol and his PhD in Computer Science at University College London. His PhD thesis was on feed-forward Neural Networks (NN) and genetic algorithms for automated financial time series modelling.


## Career

Kingdon was one of theᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ earliest pioneers in applying AI for enterprise-scale problems starting in the mid-nineties.

While a PhD student at UCL, he co-founded Searchspace and also co-founded the Intelligent Systems Lab. Searchspace applied AI to detect money laundering, detect insider dealing detection at banks and stock exchanges. In 2005, he sold Searchspace to Warburg Pincus for $140 million.

Kingdon became an early investor in Blue Prism, a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) company, a category of enterprise software that it helped define. He led business strategy and the IPO in 2016.ᶠᵃᶜᵗ ᵒʳ ᵒᵖⁱⁿⁱᵒⁿ? As of 2020, he is the CEO and chairman of the company. The company's software provides a 'digital workforce' to organisations that carry out tasks the same way existing users do. It has over 2000 customers in 70 commercial sectors, and in more than 170 countries.

In 2020 in an article for *Computer Weekly*, Kingdon introducedᶠᵃᶜᵗ ᵒʳ ᵒᵖⁱⁿⁱᵒⁿ? the notion of the Digital Singularity where he pointed out that a consequence of robotic process automation was that all digital technologies past, present, and future could now interoperate.ᶠᵃᶜᵗ ᵒʳ ᵒᵖⁱⁿⁱᵒⁿ? He suggests this will usher a new phase of hyper-acceleration of digital technologies akin to the invention of a new Internet.


## Awards

Kingdon received the 2003 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and on behalf of Searchspace received Deloitte Fast 50 list of fastest growing technology companies in 2002 and 2005, and the *Sunday Times*’ Tech Track 100 in 2002 and 2005.
