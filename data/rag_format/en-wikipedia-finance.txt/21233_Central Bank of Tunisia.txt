# Central Bank of Tunisia



The **Central Bank of Tunisia** (Arabic: البنك المركزي التونسي, French: *Banque Centrale de Tunisie*, BCT) is the central bank of Tunisia. The bank is in Tunis and its current governor is Marouane Abassi, who replaced Chedly Ayari on 16 February 2018.


## History

Tunisia gained independence in 1956. The Central Bank of Tunisia was formed two years later in 1958. In December 1958 the newly created Tunisian dinar was disconnected from the French franc. The bank maintains a Money Museum which includes a collection of recovered Carthaginian coins.

Tunisia had a historically low inflation. The Tunisian Dinar was less volatile in 2000–2010 than the currencies of its oil-importing neighbors, Egypt and Morocco. Inflation was 4.9% in fiscal year 2007–08 and 3.5% in fiscal year 2008–09.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
