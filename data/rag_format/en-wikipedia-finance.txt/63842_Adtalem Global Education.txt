**Adtalem Global Education Inc.** is a US corporation based in Chicago, Illinois, that operates several for-profit higher education institutions, including American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine, Chamberlain University, EduPristine, Ross University School of Medicine, Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, and Walden University.


## History

Adtalem Global Education was a successor to two separate entities: DeVry Institutes and the **Keller-Taylor Corporation**, doing business as Keller Graduate School of Management. DeVry Technical Institute was acquired by the Bell & Howell company in 1966, and became part of its Education Group division. The school was renamed to DeVry Institute of Technology in 1968. In 1984, the education division was renamed **DeVry, Inc**. ("Old DeVry"), and became publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange.

The Keller-Taylor Corporation was formed in 1973 by Dennis Keller and Ronald Taylor. Keller-Taylor was the holding company of **CBA Institute** in Chicago, which later became Keller Graduate School of Management. In 1987 Keller-Taylor acquired the DeVry Institutes from Bell & Howell and merged it with Keller Graduate School of Management. The holding company's name changed to DeVry, Inc.

In 1991, DeVry became the first publicly traded education provider with an initial public offering on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In 1995, DeVry moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and began trading under the symbol DV (NYSE: DV). In 2017, the company changed its ticker symbol to ATGE (NYSE: ATGE). In 1996 DeVry acquired Becker CPA Review, now Becker Professional Education. In 2002 DeVry Institute of Technology and Keller Graduate School of Management became DeVry University. The company diversified into healthcare in 2003 with the acquisition of Ross University and added Chamberlain College of Nursing (then Deaconess College of Nursing) in 2005.

In 2007, DeVry expanded its reach into online education with the addition of Advanced Academics, an online secondary education that partners with schools and school districts across the United States. Carrington College, formerly known as Apollo College and Western Career College, joined DeVry in 2008. In 2009, DeVry acquired a majority stake in Fanor, later known as DeVry Brasil, a provider of post-secondary education with campuses located in northeastern Brazil. In June 2009, Standard and Poor's added Devry Inc. to its index of stocks, replacing newly-bankrupt General Motors.

In 2011, DeVry continued its international reach with the acquisition of ATC International (a subsidiary of Becker Professional Education), which provides professional finance and accounting training in Central and Eastern Europe as well as Central Asia; and American University of the Caribbean, a medical school located in St. Maarten. In November 2013, DeVry Inc. was renamed DeVry Education Group.

Daniel Hamburger resigned in 2016 as CEO of DeVry with a payout of 5.3 million dollars. Eight-year board member, Lisa Wardell was appointed president and CEO of DeVry Education Group. In 2017, DeVry Education was rebranded as Adtalem Global Education.

In December 2018, Adtalem completed transferral of DeVry University and Keller Graduate School of Management properties to Cogswell Education LLC. This was completed just days after the transfer of Carrington College to San Joaquin Valley College.

In 2019, Adtalem partnered with Dillard University, Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and Tuskegee University to increase physician diversity and entered into the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Partnership Challenge, created by the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus, to increase diversity in key workforce sectors.

In September 2020, Adtalem Global Education Inc announced that it began the process of purchasing Walden University for US$1.48 billion in cash. According to Higher Education Dive "Two investment firms, Engine Capital and Hawk Ridge Partners, wrote in an open letter...that they were "severely disappointed" with the board's decision to purchase Walden, calling the college a 'substantially inferior asset.'"

In August 2021, Adtalem Global Education Inc completed its acquisition of Walden University.

In 2022, Adtalem sold the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists, Becker Professional Education and OnCourse Learning to Wendel Group and Colibri Group, respectively.
