## History

The bank was initially founded on January 22, 1889, as the Building & Loan Association of Catskill. Thomas E. Ferrier, Catskill Town Supervisor and owner of a brickyard and knitting mill, was elected as the Association's first President. In 1911, the Building and Loan Association of Catskill changed its name to the Catskill Savings & Loan Association (CS&LA), and began accepting savings deposits.

In 1930, the CS&LA purchased its first building, located at 389 Main Street in Catskill, NY, for $15,000. In 1940, total assets reached $1 million for the first time in the organization's history. In 1963, the CS&LA moved to a location at 425 Main Street in Catskill, with a full-service office and a drive-up window. In 1974, the Catskill Savings & Loan Association converted to a state-chartered savings bank and changed its name to Greene County Savings Bank, opening its first dedicated branch in Coxsackie.

J. Bruce Whittaker became President of the Greene County Savings Bank in 1987.

In 1998, The Greene County Savings Bank changed its name to The Bank of Greene County and went public, establishing a holding company â€“ Greene County Bancorp, Inc. The bank also established a Charitable Foundation to support education, the arts, affordable housing, and other causes. To date the Charitable Foundation has donated $2.9 million to non-profit organizations in New York's Hudson Valley and Capital Region.

In 1999, the bank's common stock was approved for listing on NASDAQ under the symbol GCBC. The bank also purchased and renovated a historic art deco building at 302 Main Street, moving their administrative headquarters to the new building. Built in 1931 as the Cooperative Insurance Building, it was designed by architect E. P. Valkenburgh of Middletown. Over the next few years, new branches would be opened in Tannersville, Westerlo, Hudson, Catskill, Greenport, Chatham, Ravena, Germantown, Kingston, Copake, Woodstock, and Albany. The existing Coxsackie and Cairo branches were also moved and expanded.

In 2006, the bank established its operations department at 288 Main Street in Catskill. The location was formerly a livery and car dealership.

J. Bruce Whittaker retired on June 30, 2007, after 20 years as president and CEO. He was succeeded by Donald Gibson, who started with the bank in 1987, and was promoted to senior vice president of commercial and retailing banking in 2003.

In 2013, the bank established its lending center at 341 Main Street in Catskill. Built in 1909 by American architect Marcus T. Reynolds, the building was formerly the Catskill Savings Bank. In 2014, the building was added to the Greene County Historical Register.

In late 2014, the bank announced its first Ulster County Branch location in Kingston, NY, which opened in early 2015. The Bank opened its second Ulster County location, in Woodstock, in the fall of 2018.
