## Legislative status

According to the law, all pension payments are made from the Pension Fund of Ukraine. The Pension Fund of Ukraine monitors the target use of funds that go to payouts. The Pension Fund of Ukraine shall, in accordance with the established procedure, submit proposals to the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy of Ukraine on the issues of formation of the state pension policy and control the implementation of official legislative acts.

Activities of the Pension Fund of Ukraine are subordinated and coordinated by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine through the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine.


## Pension reform

The implementation of pension reform proceeds through the gradual introduction of a three-tier pension system:

* The first tier is a Solidarity system
* The send tier is Mandatory Accumulation System
* The third tier is Voluntary Non-State Pension Savings System

The main objectives of the pension reform are:

* to raise the living standards of pensioners;
* to establish the dependence of the size of pensions on the numbers such as earnings and length of service;
* to ensure the financial stability of the pension system;
* to encourage citizens to save money on old age;
* to create a more efficient and effective system of administrative management in pension provision.

The three-tier pension system will allow the distribution of the three components of the risk associated with changes in the demographic situation (which is more sensitive to the solidarity system) and fluctuations in the economy and in the capital market (which is more experienced by the accumulation system). Such risk-republican sharing will make the pension system more financially balanced and sustainable, which will protect employees from lowering the total income after retirement.
