## Background

In 1971, Milchem was acquired by Baker Oil Tools.

In 1985, Baker announced that it would combine its Houston-based Milchem Drilling Fluids subsidiary with competitor New Orleans–based Newpark Drilling Fluids forming Milpark, with Baker getting 64% of the merged company and Newpark Resources Inc. parent of Newpark Drilling Fluids taking 36%. Combined revenues at the time of the merger were estimated at $225 million per year.

In 1987, Baker merged with Hughes forming Baker Hughes and Hughes Drilling Fluids was merged into Milpark.

In 1993, Milpark became a product line within Baker Hughes INTEQ.

In 2004, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids was established as a stand-alone division of Baker Hughes.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
