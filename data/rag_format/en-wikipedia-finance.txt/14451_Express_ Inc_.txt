Former CEO Michael Weiss joined the brand in 1981 when the test expanded to include eight stores. By 1986, Express had 250 stores and began testing the sale of men's merchandise in 16 stores the following year. The men's fashion line was spun off into its own brand, Structure, in 1989.

In 2001, Express became a dual gender brand with the reintegration of its Structure stores as "Express Men". Dual gender Express stores began opening the following year. Structure apparel brand was sold to Sears in 2003.

### Bankruptcy

On October 24, 2023, Express warned that it may have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it has been hit hard from the COVID-19 pandemic, stating store sales have been declining for years and rising costs putting the company in heavy debt.

In February 2024, Express warned it was preparing for a debt restructuring process and a bankruptcy filing within the upcoming weeks and had hired M3 and Kirkland & Ellis to advise the company on discussions with lenders and bondholders.

On April 2, 2024, Express warned that it could file for bankruptcy as soon as the following week as it asked for lenders to help finance the bankruptcy procedure. It was having trouble paying its creditors. As a result, Express' stock fell approximately 14%. On April 22, 2024, Express and all of its affiliated subsidiaries declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, listing assets and liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion. The company announced plans to close 95 Express stores and all of its UpWest stores. Liquidation sales began on April 23, with the affected stores to conclude liquidation sales by June 30. The company also received a non-binding letter from WHP Global for the sale of most of its stores, operations, and assets. That same day, Express announced that it would sell itself in Chapter 11 to a group led by Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties, and also warned that more closures could come within weeks.

On April 23, 2024, Express warned that it could be forced to liquidate if it is unable to complete a proposed buyout within the next 30 days.

In June 2024, PHOENIX, a joint venture led by WHP Global, Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties, received court approval to acquire Express's operations.


### Express as a privately held company

In May 2007, Limited Brands announced its intent to sell a 67% stake in Express to an affiliate of a private equity firm called Golden Gate Capital Partners, based in San Francisco. When the sale was finalized in July 2007, Golden Gate's stake in the company was 75% instead of the announced 67%.

Since the IPO, Golden Gate and Limited Brands gradually reduced their ownership interest in the Company. In July 2011, Limited Brands sold its remaining ownership interest in the Company, and as a result of this disposition, ceased to be a related party as of the end of the second quarter of 2011. In March 2012, Golden Gate sold its remaining ownership interest in the Company, and as of May 31, 2012, Golden Gate no longer had representation on the Board.
