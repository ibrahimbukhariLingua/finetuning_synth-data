**Solar Philippines Power Project Holdings, Inc.**, or simply **Solar Philippines**, is a solar energy company based in the Philippines.


## History

Solar Philippines was established in 2013 by Leandro Leviste. The company started small-scale, providing rooftop installment of solar panels it imported form China to clients. Its first project was the installment of solar panels at Central Mall in Biñan, Laguna. It also provided the rooftop solar panels of SM City North Edsa in Quezon City.

The company in 2016, was able to secure a subsidy from the Department of Energy enabling it to set up the Calatagan Solar Farm. This was followed by photovoltaic power stations in Batangas, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac.

A subsidiary, the Solar Philippines Nueva Ecija Corp. (SPNEC), which is intended to operate the Nueva Ecija Solar Farm as the world's largest solar farm was listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange in December 2021 SPNEC was renamed as SP New Energy Corp. in 2022. SPNEC began construction of the solar farm in 2021.

SPNEC's Manuel Pangilinan announced in March 2024 plans to sell 40% of the equity in Terra Solar Philippines Inc. to get more investors to build a P200-billion cache. "The investment [for the project] would be at Terra Solar, which is 100 percent owned by SPNEC. Most likely, foreign investors will come in for an up to 40-percent equity stake at the Terra Solar level," Pangilinan said.

Countryside Investment Holdings Corporation, in partnership with SPPPH, Inc is funding P5 billion to transform Batangas into a dynamic landscape for trade and energy. The strategic move will benefit 13,000 farmers and sugar mill workers who were displaced by the closure of Central Azucarera Don Pedro sugar mill in Nasugbu.
