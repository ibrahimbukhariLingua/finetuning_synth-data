**Ma Hong** (simplified Chinese: È©¨Ê¥™; traditional Chinese: È¶¨Ê¥™; pinyin: *M«é H√≥ng*; May 18, 1920 ‚Äì October 28, 2007) was a well known economist and was chiefly responsible for the reintroduction of market economics to China. He also pioneered Policy Consultation and chaired a government think tank.


## Early life

Ma was born in Dingxiang County, Shanxi, China, on 18 May 1920. Ma Hong took part in Ximenghui in 1936, an organization of resistance against the Japanese. The following year he was involved in the organization of the General Trade Union of Tongpu Railroad, and in that same year joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 1938, he went to Yan'an, then the CCP revolutionary base area, and won Chen Yun's (Minister of Organization) favor. As a result, he was admitted into the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party. After graduation in 1941 Ma Hong was assigned to be a researcher in the CCP's Central Research Institute, laying the foundations of his later economic knowledge. He was transferred the CCP's Northeast Bureau to be the director of the Policy Research Office in 1949. Through investigation Ma Hong wrote "The Structure and Policy of the Northeastern Economy", and divided it into five sectors. This method was long employed by the Chinese government. In 1952 Ma Hong was promoted to the post of General Secretary of the National Planning Committee of the Central Government.·∂ú‚Å±·µó·µÉ·µó‚Å±·µí‚Åø ‚Åø·µâ·µâ·µà·µâ·µà

During the Gao-Rau Incident, Ma Hong was purged and demoted. He came to work in the National Economic Committee and was involved in the drafting of the "70 Industrial Regulations", which helped China recover from the Great Leap Forward. After co-composing the regulations Ma Hong wrote the "Management of Chinese Manufacturing Enterprises", which became the compass of industrial management at that time.·∂ú‚Å±·µó·µÉ·µó‚Å±·µí‚Åø ‚Åø·µâ·µâ·µà·µâ·µà
