After the World War II, he rejoined the bank and was promoted quickly. In 1957, he was named president of the Farmers' Loan and Trust Company, succeeding Richard S. Perkins who had been president since 1951. In 1959, it became First National City Trust which was incorporated into First National City Bank in 1963, when he was named "senior vice president in charge of the trust and investment division" before retiring in 1982.

After helping create "a $200 million modernization program" that was approved by the New York Legislature in 1965, "Pyne was appointed to a seat on the transportation agency's original five-member governing board. In that post, which he held until 1975, he helped steer the agency’s acquisition of other ailing suburban lines that had been merged into Conrail and later formed Metro-North." He was also a commissioner of the New York City Transit Authority, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority and Stewart International Airport.

His small artillery-observation plane was shot down by enemy fire over the Po Valley in Northern Italy, "he was briefly taken prisoner, but jumped off his German captors’ truck and escaped to Allied lines with the help of Italian partisans. He returned home in 1946 as a Major, with the Bronze Star and five battle stars."
