Mexican Debt Disclosure Act of 1995


# Mexican Debt Disclosure Act of 1995



The **Mexican Debt Disclosure Act** is a law of the United States formulating congressional oversight and monetary policy, through reports of the US president and the US treasury, to support the strength of the 1995 peso currency of Mexico; all resulting from speculative capital flight and the Mexican peso crisis of 1994. The Act required the submission of monthly reports by the United States Secretary of the Treasury concerning all international guarantees, long-term, and short-term currency swaps with the federal government of Mexico. The U.S. Congressional bill required the submission of semi-annual reports by the President of the United States concerning presidential certifications of all international credits, currency swaps, guarantees, and loans through the exchange stabilization fund to the government of Mexico.

The U.S. legislative bill was introduced in the United States Senate as S. 384 on February 10, 1995. The U.S. Congressional S. 384 bill was superseded by H.R. 889 on April 4, 1995. The H.R. 889 legislation was passed by the 104th United States Congress on April 6, 1995 and enacted into law by the 42nd President of the United States Bill Clinton on April 10, 1995.

The document leading to this law was a unilateral program drafted by the Clinton administration for an expedited help to Mexico not requiring congress approval.
