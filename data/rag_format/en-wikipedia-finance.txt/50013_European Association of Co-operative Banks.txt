European Association of Co-operative Banks


# European Association of Co-operative Banks



The **European Association of Co-operative Banks** (**EACB**) is a European interest group representing cooperative banks in the European Union (EU) and five non-European countries. Established in 1970, the non-profit association "represents, promotes and defends" the common interests of its **27** member institutions and **2.500** cooperative banks regarding banking as well as cooperative legislation.

Based in Brussels, the EACB is recognised as a key spokesperson for cooperative banks by regulators and supervisors at EU and international levels. As the representative of the world's largest cooperative banking cluster, it works together with more than 200 experts from its member organisations to substantiate the key role that cooperative banks play in the financial and economic system, and its impact value for its members, the economy as a whole and society at large.

The EACB supports the code of conduct on lobbying of the European Commission and is registered in the EU transparency register book (Transparency Book Register 4172526951-19).


## Cooperative banking in the EU


### Key characteristics of cooperative banking

Cooperative banks are a major pillar of diversity in the European banking sector. They are banks owned and controlled by people who are also clients of the bank. As such, they are geared toward maximising member value on the long-run. More specifically, they are characterised by their member ownership model; member benefits/surplus through long-term relationship; 'One person - One vote' governance with a bottom-up approach; limited participation in profit; commitment to social values and ESG; and proximity to customers' regional presence in terms of decision-making and financing.

The cooperative model finds its origins in the cooperative movement first conceived by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen and Schulze-Delitzsch in the first half of the nineteenth century. The movement was grounded on the principles of self-help and equality to secure financial access to less privileged groups of society, especially from rural areas.

Cooperative banks today deliver value across the four categories as regards their specific business model, the diversity and balance they bring to financial markets, long-term relationship and trust with members and customers, and their wider social impact. They contribute widely to stability thanks to their anti-cyclical behaviour, and are drivers of local and social growth for consumers, SMEs and communities.

### History

Following an initiative launched by Johannes Teichert to create a representative body for credit cooperatives of 6 EU-member states, a first meeting with the European Commission was held in December 1969. The gathering led shortly after to the foundation of the Association of Cooperative Savings and Credit Institutions of the E.E.C on 1 October 1970. The first statues of the Association were signed at the end of 1971 by the founding members:

* Caisse Centrale des Associations Agricoles Luxembourgeoises
