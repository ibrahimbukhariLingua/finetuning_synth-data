## Establishment and history

Argo Investments Limited was established in Adelaide, South Australia in 1946 by Kevin Ward QC, solicitor, and Alf Adamson, a chartered accountant who had previously worked on company valuations. Donald Bradman was chairman of the company from 1982 to 1984.

In 1990, Argo acquired investment company Schroder Dual Fund, and in 1992 it acquired Stoddarts Holdings. Argo was involved in the establishment of other LICs, including Bounty Investments Ltd and Wakefield Investments Ltd, both of which Argo maintained an investment in. In 2001, Argo merged with both Bounty and Wakefield, after making successful takeover offers for both, on the basis of offering Argo shares in exchange for shares in the companies being acquired. These terms of acquisition allowed Bounty and Wakefield shareholders to be relieved from liability to pay capital gains tax on the disposal of their shares.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Argo Global Listed Infrastructure (AGLI)

For the purpose of managing a portfolio of foreign company shares, Argo launched AGLI as a separate company and listed it on the ASX (code ALI) on 3 July 2015. The advantage to shareholders is a single "paper trail" of income from foreign sources. AGLI is managed by ASCO, a wholly owned subsidiary of Argo.
