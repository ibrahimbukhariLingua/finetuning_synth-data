The society currently provides financial services both directly and through a 132-strong branch network and 99 associated agencies across the UK.


## History

In 1864, the Huddersfield Equitable Permanent Benefit Building Society was founded in Huddersfield, and expansion through a series of agreed mergers, predominantly with the *Bradford Permanent Building Society* in 1975, has seen it evolve into the national building society that it is today. The current name came into use in 1982, following the merger of the *Huddersfield & Bradford Building Society* and the *West Yorkshire Building Society*. Yorkshire Building Society also has a mortgage subsidiary company, Accord. In August 2011 it announced that it was closing its offshore subsidiary, Yorkshire Guernsey.

High Point on Westgate in Bradford was built as the headquarters of Yorkshire Building Society in the 1970s.

The Yorkshire took over the Sussex-based Haywards Heath Building Society in 1992, in an effort to develop a southern based branch presence. In 2001, the Society merged with the Gainsborough Building Society.

In 2008, the Yorkshire merged with the Barnsley Building Society which had become a victim of the Icelandic banking crisis. After learning lessons from previous mergers, and with the Barnsley being a larger organisation with a well-established brand, the Yorkshire initially decided to keep the Barnsley brand in order to keep existing customers and use it as another route to market their products.

In 2009, the Yorkshire noted that they were in advanced merger talks with Chelsea Building Society. The following day it was announced that they were to merge. The merger with Chelsea Building Society, which retained its own branding until 2016, was completed in 2010. Chelsea branded products and services are now available online and by telephone only.

The ninth largest building society at the time, Norwich and Peterborough, entered into merger discussions with the Society on 19 March 2011. Following due diligence by the Yorkshire board, N&P members voted in favour of the proposal on 22 August. FSA approval followed on 23 September and the transfer of engagements was completed on 1 November. With almost no geographical overlap, the N&P name was retained as a separate and distinct brand.

On 25 July 2011, the Yorkshire announced it was buying the Egg savings and mortgage business from Citi in a deal worth £2.5 billion. Use of the Egg trade marks by Yorkshire Building Society is currently under licence from Egg Banking Plc which provides any residual Egg savings products that were not transferred to the Yorkshire and any Egg loans products that were not sold to Britannica Recoveries S.a.r.l.


## Brass band

In 1993, the former Hammonds Sauce Works Band was renamed as the Yorkshire Building Society Band. The building society supported the main band and also the YBS Hawley Band and YBS Juniors. The building society ceased its sponsorship in December 2004 although the YBS initials were retained in the band's name until 2008. From January 2009, the band was renamed the Hammonds Saltaire Band.
