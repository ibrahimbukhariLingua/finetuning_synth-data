# Johann-Rudolf Marcuard



**Johann-Rudolf Marcuard** (25 December 1721 – 13 March 1795) was a Swiss banker. He founded the bank Marcuard & Cie, which became one of the most prominent banks of the 18th century until its acquisition by Credit Suisse in 1919.

The bank Marcuard & Cie, active in all the major metropolises of Europe, was notably commissioned in Vienna by Maria Theresa of Austria.

Carrying forward Johann Rudolf Marcuard’s legacy to the present day, the direct descendants of the family have established the Marcuard brand as a global network of wealth management firms across four continents. Today, these firms remain dedicated to the family’s foundational principles of client-centric service and trusted expertise.
