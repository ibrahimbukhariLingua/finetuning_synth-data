**eConversions** is an online marketing company based in Clerkenwell, London. eConversions was founded by brothers Duncan and Max Jennings in 2004 and is mostly known for launching VoucherCodes.co.uk in August 2008, currently the UK's largest coupon code website.


## Acquisition

In August 2011, VoucherCodes.co.uk was acquired by WhaleShark Media, which was partly funded by several venture capital firms, including Google Ventures. The acquisition was part of WhaleShark Media's strategy to expand its presence in the global online coupon industry, as the company had previously acquired several other coupon websites, such as Deals2Buy, Coupon7, CouponShare, CheapStingyBargains.com, Deals.com, and RetailMeNot.

At the time of the acquisition, VoucherCodes.co.uk was generating around $15 million in revenue, and the deal was estimated to be valued at approximately $40 million in cash and stock, though official figures were not disclosed. WhaleShark Media was particularly interested in eConversions' email marketing expertise, as the company had more than four million subscribers to its weekly email newsletter.


## Rebranding

WhaleShark Media rebranded as RetailMeNot, Inc. in March 2013. Following the rebrand, the company continued expanding its international presence by acquiring Actiepagina.nl, the leading online coupon site in the Netherlands. This acquisition marked RetailMeNotâ€™s fourth European acquisition, joining VoucherCodes in the UK, Poulpeo in France, and Deals.com in Germany.
