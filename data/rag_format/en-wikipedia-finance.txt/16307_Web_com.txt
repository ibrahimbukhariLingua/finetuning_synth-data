## History


### Website Pros Inc.

David Brown established Website Pros Inc.'s predecessor, the technology services company Atlantic Teleservices, Inc., in Jacksonville in 1997. Brown served as CEO until 1999, when he sold the company to Website Pros, via the venture and growth equity investment firm Norwest Venture Partners. Website Pros was founded in 1999 by Darin Brannan. Brown joined the company's board of directors.

The company planned to establish a chain of stores for people to access services to develop and maintain their own websites. The Collapse of the .com market in 2000, required the company to shift from a retail model to an indirect sales model to conserve capital. Brown then oversaw a series of acquisitions, averaging one per year for a decade. The largest of the acquired companies was NetObjects, a Redwood City, California-based software company best known for developing the web design tool NetObjects Fusion. Website Pros purchased the company, including its GoBizGo and NetObjects Matrix assets, in October 2001 for an undisclosed amount.

Website Pros acquired the Spokane-based e-commerce services provider Innuity in 2002, resulting in the merged company's change from an upfront fee structure to monthly subscriptions. The company was growing by 40 percent annually by 2003, and had 260 employees (around 150 in Jacksonville and 110 in Spokane) by the end of the year. Website Pros received $17 million in venture capital, which included $10 million in December 2003 from Insight Venture Partners and $7 million Norwest in April 2004. The *Jacksonville Business Journal* reported that Website Pros had 40,000 clients, including Discover Business Services and IBM, at the time the company secured funding from Norwest. Brown began preparing Website Pros for an initial public offering in 2004, and the company went public in 2005. Website Pros acquired eBoz and Leads.com, and reported $37.8 million in sales, in 2005. In 2006, Julius Genachowski joined Web.com's board, along with Hugh M. Durden and G. Harry Durity. Website Pros acquired the Canadian company 1ShoppingCart.com, which offers software e-commerce services, for $12.5 million, as well as Renex, an online lead generation provider for contractors and homeowners, in late 2006.

In 2007, Website Pros acquired the Atlanta-based company Web.com, which was founded in 1981 and formerly known as Interland, Inc. Under the agreement, which was valued at $129 million, Website Pros paid $25 million in cash and the rest in stock. Brown continued to serve as chairman and CEO of the merged company, and Jeff Stibel, who was serving as president and CEO of Web.com, became a president and board member of Website Pros. The company remained headquartered in Jacksonville, and the merger resulted in a more than three-fold increase in the number of paid subscribers.


### Web.com (2008–present)

Website Pros changed its name to Web.com in early 2008. In June, the company began trading as "WWWW" on NASDAQ; executives commemorated the change by closing the stock exchange at Times Square's NASDAQ MarketSite on June 9. Stibel served as president until 2009. Web.com had nearly one million subscribers and was earning $120 million in revenue by the end of 2010.

In 2012, the company became the title sponsor of the Web.com Tour, a developmental professional golf tour for the U.S.-based PGA Tour, in a deal that extends through 2021. In conjunction with the tour, Web.com hosts "summits", or designated spaces for people to meet company representatives and learn about its offerings; Web.com hosted 27 of these events in 2013. *Financial News & Daily Record* reported that the company had 500 employees in Jacksonville, plus an additional 1,400 in satellite offices, in October 2012. By 2014, Web.com had 2,000 employees in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, and Argentina.

Web.com's customer service center in Drums, Pennsylvania opened in January 2016. The company opened a digital customer service center in New Glasgow's Aberdeen Business Centre, in September 2016. The office became Web.com's third call center in Nova Scotia; the company also has offices in Halifax and Yarmouth. Web.com generated $710.5 million in revenue in 2016, an increase from $543.5 million in 2015.

In March 2017, the International Customer Management Institute named Web.com a finalist in the "Best Large Contact Center" category at its annual Global Contact Center Awards, which recognize "companies and individuals that honor leadership, vision, innovation and strategic accomplishments within the customer service industry." In May 2017, the company relocated 175 employees within Scottsdale, Arizona's SkySong development into the SkySong 4 building. Yodle, which was acquired by Web.com in 2016, had moved into SkySong in 2009. The new SkySong 4 office space will house administrative and sales operations. The company was reportedly approached by private equity firms about a possible buyout in 2017.
