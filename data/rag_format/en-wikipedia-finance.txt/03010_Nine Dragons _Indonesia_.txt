Nine Dragons (Indonesia)


# Nine Dragons (Indonesia)



**Nine Dragons** (Indonesian: *Sembilan Naga*) is a term referring to a group of influential businessmen of Chinese descent in Indonesia, especially those who had close ties with the New Order government. This term is often associated with significant economic and political power, although the membership of this group has never been officially confirmed.


## History

The term "Nine Dragons" emerged during the New Order era, which was characterized by mutually beneficial relationships between businessmen and the government. Initially, this term, also known as the 'Gang of Nine', had negative and mysterious connotations. The group was associated with illicit businesses such as gambling, drugs, and smuggling, and was considered above the law due to strong backing from authorities. After the New Order ended, the connotation of "Nine Dragons" shifted to become more neutral, referring to businessmen who dominated the Indonesian economy, considered as a result of mutualistic symbiosis with the New Order government.


## Members

There are no conclusive sources or evidence that precisely identify the members of the Nine Dragons. Nevertheless, several names are often mentioned as potential members, including:

* Robert Budi Hartono, (Djarum);
* Rusdi Kirana, (Lion Air Group);
* Sofjan Wanandi, (Santini Group);
* Jacob Soetoyo, (PT Gesit Sarana Perkasa);
* James Riady, (Lippo Group);
* Tomy Winata, (Artha Graha Group);
* Anthoni Salim, (Salim Group);
* Dato Sri Tahir, (Mayapada Group);
* Edwin Soeryadjaya, (PT Astra International);
* Sugianto Kusuma, also known as Aguan (Agung Sedayu Group).

Some of the mentioned businessmen have denied their involvement, such as Tommy Winata, who considers it a damaging imagination.


## Impact

The existence of the "Nine Dragons" demonstrates the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a few businessmen. Their dominance is reflected in various important sectors such as banking, real estate, manufacturing, and retail. The "Nine Dragons" are considered to have made significant contributions to Indonesia's economic growth, especially during the New Order era, with their massive investments in various sectors. However, their dominance has also raised concerns about monopolistic practices, economic inequality, and lack of fair competition.
