In September 2023, Varian was called to testify in the *United States v. Google* lawsuit by the Department of Justice on a memo he wrote in 2003: "Thoughts on Google v Microsoft." with the subject "We should be careful about what we say in both public and private". The DOJ also brought up memos where Varian instructed Google employees to avoid the use of language such as "market share," "scale," "network effects," "leverage," "lock up," "lock in," "bundle," and "tie.", to avoid Google from being perceived as being a monopoly and to avoid scrutiny from antitrust watchdogs.
