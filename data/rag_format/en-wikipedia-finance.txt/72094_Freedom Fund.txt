Freedom Fund


# Freedom Fund



The **Freedom Fund** is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to identifying and investing in the most effective frontline efforts to end slavery. In 2017, the International Labour Organization reported that on any given day in 2016, there were 40 million people living in modern slavery worldwide across a wide range of industries.

The Freedom Fund was founded in September 2013, by three leading anti-slavery donors, Humanity United, the Legatum Foundation and the Walk Free Foundation and officially announced by President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative on September 26, 2013 where he declared "this is a huge deal and we should all support this."


## Mission and values

The Freedom Fund has set a target of raising USD $100million by 2020 and investing it to bring about much needed strategic focus to the fight against modern slavery. To achieve this, The Freedom Fund has focused its activities on three main areas:


## Leadership

The Freedom Fund's inaugural CEO, Nick Grono, has written articles on modern slavery for the *Huffington Post*, *Newsweek*, *The Guardian*, as well as the Freedom Fund blog. Grono previously served as Deputy President and COO of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group and as CEO of the Walk Free Foundation, an international anti-slavery organisation. During his tenure, the Walk Free Foundation built a global anti-slavery movement with over five million supporters and launched the first ever Global Slavery Index. Grono joined Freedom Fund in December 2013.


## Impact

Freedom Fund operates as a meta-charity which disburses grants to local partners who directly implement anti-slavery initiatives. Freedom Fund requires funding recipients to evaluate their performance using a common set of metrics, answering questions including "How many people are being reached directly?" and "[What's the] cost per person to each project?".

As of June 2020 the Freedom Fund reported to have:

* Impacted 765,628 lives
* Liberated 28,040 people from modern slavery
* Helped 57,419 previously out-of-school children to receive formal or non-formal education

**COVID-19 emergency fund**: In response to the 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic, The Freedom Fund set up a COVID-19 emergency fund which offered immediate, small scale support to frontline responders in disadvantaged communities in Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand. Monetary assistance was used for food, shelter, protective equipment for medical professionals, sanitation, and other immediate virus-related needs.
