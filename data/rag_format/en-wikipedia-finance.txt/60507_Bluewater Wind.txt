**Bluewater Wind** is an energy company on the North Atlantic Coast, United States, and in the Great Lakes Region, United States, developing offshore wind energy projects. Bluewater's staff has experience in the wind, energy, environmental, finance, public policy, and marine sectors. Bluewater Wind was part of the Babcock & Brown family of companies. and become part of NRG Energy.

In response to public requests, Bluewater selects offshore locations, conducts environmental studies and assesses wind resources. In addition, Bluewater selects contractors who plan connection to the grid and arrange for delivery of the energy to customers. Lastly, Bluewater secures financing early on in the development process to see the project through from concept to decommissioning.


## The Bluewater philosophy

Every new project begins with information transparency early on in project development, discourse with local stakeholders and voluntary project modifications in response to public input. The company engages with local environmental, trade, union, community, and academic organizations in order to assess the needs and wants of the community.

For example, the companies level of public engagement led to the scrutiny of one potential project site located in the Delaware Bay during the summer of 2007. Local bird protection organizations were concerned about the impact that the wind turbines would have on the migratory pattern of the birds that fly over the bay. The organizations provided evidence of their concerns and explained to Bluewater project management the real costs involved with the site. As a result, the company ceased developments for that site.
