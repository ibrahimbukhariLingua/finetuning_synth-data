By 2015, up to 50 court decisions had been rendered against Aviva France. In September 2014, the French Supreme court, the Cour de Cassation, ruled in favor of the George family, determining that the life insurance contracts, as drafted with the "known price" clause, are legally binding under French law. Nevertheless, George is still in court against Aviva, having won on the principle of the legality of the contracts, he now needs to have his prejudice recognized and valued in a second ongoing battle.

It is reported that at least 30 other people are in litigation with Aviva, with the possibility of thousands of similar contracts existing. Aviva has been repeatedly criticized for not disclosing the measure of the risks related to the "known price" contracts, *"failing to show these potential losses on its books, it is also neglecting its duty to its shareholders and policyholders".*

On 23 February 2021, Aviva sold its French business to Aema Group.
