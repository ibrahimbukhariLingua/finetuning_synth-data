European Services Forum


# European Services Forum



The **European Services Forum** (ESF) is a lobby group of representatives from the European services sector that promote the liberalisation of international trade in services. It was created in April 1999 in order to give recommendations to the European Commission in the GATS negotiations of the World Trade Organization. Since 2012, the Forum is supporting the negotiations concerning the Trade in Services Agreement.
