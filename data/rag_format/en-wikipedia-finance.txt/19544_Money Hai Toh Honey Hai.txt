## Plot

*Money Hai Toh Honey Hai* tells the story of six individuals who are each struggling in their own way. Bobby Arora is a happy-go-lucky guy who runs away from home to prove himself. Lallabhai becomes wealthy after winning the lottery, but he loses all his money when his business fails. Gaurav is a copywriter who is fired from his job. Manik is a struggling model who sleeps with a middle-aged fashion designer in hopes of making it big. Ashima Kapoor is a successful TV star, but she is not happy with her career and wants to star in films. Shruti is a struggling dress designer.

One day, the six of them receive an SMS informing them that they are the owners of Shahenshah Jaiswal's 1000-crore company. However, their happiness is short-lived when they learn that the company is in debt of 1200 crores. They are told that they will be kept under house arrest until the debt is repaid.

The six friends decide to use the extra cloth left from a failed shipment to Korea to make garments that are affordable for ordinary people. They display their garments in a fashion show, and the show is a success. The bank agrees to help them repay the debt, and the six friends are able to turn the company around.

The film ends with Bobby and Ashima getting married.

## Reception


### Critical reception

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN rated it 2/5: "Sorely lacking in drama and genuine humour, *Money Hai Toh Honey* is mind-numbingly dull because there’s no conflict or plot progression, and everything seems to fall into place too conveniently, which even ruins the amazing comedy at the first half!"

Mayank Shekhar of *Hindustan Times* rated it 2.5/5: "Scenes may well be dull and weak in parts. And they are. But for a comedy film, it needs to have some more sense-of-humor".

Raja Sen of Rediff rated it 1.5/5: "This is, first and foremost, a tacky film. The tastelessness flowing right down into the script, however, makes for a very different league of disaster."

Taran Adarsh of *Bollywood Hungama* rated it 2/5: "*Money Hai Toh Honey Hai* is a poor show. Watch the first half and laugh your total head-off, but at the second half, try to enjoy a damp squib!"

Nikhat Kazmi of *The Times of India* gave it the highest rating it got: 3.5/5: "*Money Hai Toh Honey* made a complete laugh-riot in the first part, but soon after the interval a lot of drama and romance jumps in which is totally something you don't need in a comedy movie, it needed a much smarter script to keep the laughter ringing".
