## Operations

This financial service is regulated under the Bangladesh Postal Act Amendment 2010 Section 3(2), a unique law procured especially for the Bangladesh Post Office by the government of Bangladesh. The digital financial service was launched by the Bangladesh Post Office on 11 November 2018. It started operations on 26 March 2019, celebrating the 48th Independence Day of the country.

Nagad started its journey with demanding services like cash-in, cash-out, send money, and mobile recharge. More popular services like bills payment and e-commerce payment gateway are now available. From the very beginning, Nagad has its own mobile app for customers and partners. It also introduced a revolutionary customer on-boarding feature- DKYC (Digital KYC) blending Bangla OCR, automated identity verification and localized data that has minimized overall customer acquisition and life cycle time to one/tenth of market practice as well focusing on paper-less environment.
