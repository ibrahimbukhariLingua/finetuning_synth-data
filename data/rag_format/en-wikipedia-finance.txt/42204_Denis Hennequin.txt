## Professional corporate career


### McDonald's

After becoming Restaurant Manager, he moved on to numerous positions within the organization including Training & Recruitment Consultant, Field Service Consultant, Director of Franchising, Director of Operations and Regional Manager for Paris and surrounding suburbs.

In 1996, he became President and Managing Director of McDonald's France at a time when McDonald's in France was perceived as a symbol of globalization's negative effects. To counter this sentiment, Hennequin launched a successful "Born in the USA, made in France" public relations campaign, proclaiming that the franchises are French-owned, employ French people and use 80% French-produced products. He also dedicated resources into re-imaging 70% of the branches in France to better integrate the fast-food chain into the European context, incorporating hardwood floors, upholstery seating, attractive facades and even gas fireplaces. From July 2005 to November 30, 2010, he served as President of McDonald's Europe Limited and was responsible for 6,600 restaurants in 40 countries. He is the first non-American to hold the job of president of McDonald's Europe since the company's European implantation in 1971. By 2007, France became the highest grossing market for McDonald's after the USA.
