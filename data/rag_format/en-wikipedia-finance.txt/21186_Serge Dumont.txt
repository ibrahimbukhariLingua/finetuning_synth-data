In 1985, he moved to Hong Kong and Beijing and established China’s first corporate communications and public affairs consultancy, Interasia. The company acquired a roster of Fortune 500 clients and became a market leader in Asia, helping multinational companies like Procter & Gamble launch their brands in the region. He became known for introducing Western brands to the Asian market, organizing corporate events like Richemont’s "Watches and Wonders” in the Forbidden City and Fendi’s catwalk show at the Great Wall. Dumont is "credited with pioneering the industry there from its infancy to today’s sophisticated business sector.”

In 1993, Dumont sold Interasia to the world's largest public relations company, Edelman. At Edelman, he was appointed Executive Vice President and President of Asia, and served on the Global Board. Dumont helped establish Edelman China as the country’s top agency.

From 1998 to 2006, Dumont concentrated on private equity and merger & acquisition activities, as well as strategic advisory and philanthropic work. In 2006, he joined Omnicom Group and in 2011 was appointed Vice Chairman of the Omnicom Group and Chairman, Asia Pacific, managing the portfolio of companies owned by Omnicom and helping spearhead Omnicom’s strategic expansion in Asia. One of his key responsibilities was directly managing the fast-growing Greater China business unit by developing business strategies for all Omnicom activities and building relationships that expanded the group’s operational footprint globally. Dumont reported to John Wren, the Chairman and CEO of Omnicom, who credited him for making a “major contribution to building [Omnicom’s] capabilities and reach.” Dumont was also involved with training and education at Omnicom, in addition to diversity and inclusion initiatives.

In 2018, Dumont left Omnicom to focus on philanthropic and investment activities.
