HMV Ireland


# HMV Ireland



**HMV Ireland** is an entertainment retailing company operated in Ireland by Hilco Capital Ireland. The first incarnation was first established by HMV Group Plc as part of their international expansion into Ireland and Canada in 1986. The first shop in Ireland established was at HMV on Grafton Street in Dublin (closed since February 2013, reopened in new location in 2014, a different location in 2015 and closed again in 2016). HMV have announced their return to the Irish market, and a new shop opened in Henry Street in Dublin on 30 June 2023.


## History


### 1986–2000s

HMV established its first shop in Ireland in 1986 following the retailer's expansion to Canada. The first shop to open was on Grafton Street which became very popular for numerous big name Irish acts performing live in the shop. The retailer expanded in Dublin with a second shop on Henry Street and that followed with expansion into Cork in the late 1980s before adding a shop in Limerick City in the 1990s. The retailer expanded with numerous shops in the Greater Dublin region and nationwide again into Galway and Newbridge in the early to mid 2000s.

On 5 February 2011 HMV Ireland announced that its profits had fallen by almost 90% to €465,000, compared to €4.1 million the previous year.


### Receivership

Following increased pressure from high rental rates in Ireland, increased legal and illegal downloading and competition from online retailers in January 2013 HMV's parent company HMV Group plc went into administration in the United Kingdom, potentially affecting its operations within Ireland, Hong Kong and Singapore. In January 2013, its 16 shops in the Republic went into receivership and as a result its Irish subsidiary ceased trading with the loss of 300 jobs. On 15 January 2013 HMV Ireland refused to accept HMV vouchers within its shops following HMV UK's administration, although HMV Ireland was a separate entity to the UK operation. The refusal of vouchers proved controversial for staff and customers, leading to speculation that HMV Ireland would also enter administration.

On 16 January 2013, HMV Ireland declared receivership. Under Irish law, a company in receivership must close its outlets with immediate effect; all Irish shops were closed until further notice. Deloitte Ireland was appointed receiver and are reportedly seeking a buyer for HMV's Irish shops. The National Consumer Agency in Ireland questioned the legal basis on which HMV in Ireland refused to honour gift vouchers and this criticism was later supported by accountancy agencies claiming that HMV Ireland Ltd. was not part of the HMV UK administration and refusal of vouchers was unlawful prior to receivership. Since HMV Ireland's announcement of receivership staff located at HMV shops in Limerick and Cork refused to leave the premises based on the uncertainty whether they will get paid for December and early January. Deloitte confirmed on 19 January that all staff would be paid what they were owed, and that it was attempting to sell the Irish shops. It was confirmed on 12 February 2013 that all shops within Ireland were officially closed with immediate effect and HMV had left the Irish market place. It resulted in the loss of 300 jobs.


### May to September 2013: Hilco Capital Ireland reinvestment

On 9 June 2013, it revealed that Hilco Capital had purchased HMV Ireland, with five shops to be reopened in Ireland within six weeks, with a flagship shop opening on Dublin's Henry Street, followed by additional shops over the following six weeks, including in Dublin's Liffey Valley Shopping Centre, Dundrum Town Centre and the Crescent Shopping Centre in Limerick. A fifth shop was expected to open in Cork and possibly an additional one in Galway. HMV Ireland was expected to re-invest up to €4 million in its Irish shops and employ 100 people.

On 27 August 2013, Hilco Ireland announced that HMV Ireland shops would open in early September and that unused HMV vouchers purchased through the companies previous owners would be honoured. HMV on Henry Street was the first to open on 6 September 2013, by Irish band The Strypes. All other shops were to open the following week, with the Dundrum shop to open at a later date. On 29 August 2013, HMV Ireland also confirmed that 26 HMV concessions would open in Xtra-vision outlets from late September, including in Athlone, Ballina, Blackpool and Douglas in Cork, Carlow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Portlaoise, Ennis, Galway and Thurles, thus increasing HMV's presence on the Irish high street. HMV Ireland confirmed that it would launch services already available to customers in Canada to be made available in Ireland including HMV's localised website hmv.ie and its digital service 'The Vault'.

The Dublin Henry Street shop reopened on 5 September 2013 and the Liffey Valley shopping centre, Dundrum Town Centre and Limerick Crescent shopping centre shops re-opened on 12 September 2013.

HMV opened a new branch on Grafton Street on 19 April 2014 and in Edward Square, Galway in Summer 2014.

In early 2016, HMV Ireland confirmed the closure of its Galway City shop and its shop on Dublin's Grafton Street, with both to close by the end of January. This followed the closure of many Xtravision and HMV Xtravision branded outlets at the end of December 2015/early January. In late January 2016, the remainder of Xtravision was liquidated.


### Closure in 2016

In July 2016, Hilco announced it would be closing its remaining five shops, in order to refocus HMV in Ireland as a new digital service (HMV Digital) where customers can stream, rent or purchase music and films online. The new HMV digital service was to launch in Ireland before rolling out into the UK and Canada. However, HMV failed to successfully launch its new digital service in Ireland. All shops closed between 29 and 30 August 2016.

**Reopening in 2023**

On 18 May 2023, HMV’s owner Sunrise Records announced they would enter the Irish market again with a shop on Dublin’s Henry Street, in a unit previously occupied by the company during their first incarnation. The shop opened on 30 June 2023.
