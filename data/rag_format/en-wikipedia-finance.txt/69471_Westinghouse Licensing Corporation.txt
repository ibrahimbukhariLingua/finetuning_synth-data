Westinghouse Licensing Corporation


# Westinghouse Licensing Corporation



The **Westinghouse Licensing Corporation** (now named **Wilmerding Licensing Corporation**) was a Delaware General Corporation Law organized subsidiary that was founded in 1998 by Westinghouse-CBS (the renamed original Westinghouse) in managing the intellectual property assets relating to the Westinghouse trademarks produced from 1886 until 1996. The Westinghouse name and trademarks were purchased from ViacomCBS in 2021 by a new company called Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

Westinghouse Licensing had its headquarters in New York City.


## History

All traces of the Westinghouse name go back to the original company's roots starting in 1886 when George Westinghouse founded the company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

After the original Westinghouse acquired CBS Inc., it set about transforming itself from a diversified conglomerate with strong industrial roots into a media giant. Starting in 1996, it began selling off many of its non-media assets.
In 1997, Westinghouse acquired Infinity Broadcasting Corporation and was reorganized as the first CBS Corporation, taking on the name of the broadcasting network.

In 1999, CBS Corporation sold all of its nuclear businesses to BNFL and Westinghouse, thus jettisoning its last significant non-media assets. Soon after, BNFL gained license rights on the Westinghouse trademarks and used them to reorganize its newly acquired nuclear assets as Westinghouse Electric Company LLC. Those companies were later sold to the Toshiba Group in 2007, then Brookfield Business Partners in 2018.


## Licensing of the brand

Beginning in 1998, Westinghouse Licensing had licensed the famous brand for use on a multitude of products, some of which were in similar categories to those sold by the historic version of the company. Though these products advertise the Westinghouse name, they were not manufactured by the historic Westinghouse company.
