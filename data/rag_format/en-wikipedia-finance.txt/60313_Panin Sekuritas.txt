## History

The company was founded in 1989 as the 'Panin Group' set up a private securities firm with the name PT. Panin Sekuritasindo. In 1991 the company opened to new investors and financial partners, and subsequently changed their name to PT. Nusamas Panin.

Healthy growth in Indonesia's financial sector prompted the company's name change to PT. Panin Sekuritas. This was also part of Panin Group's effort to standardize its company divisions naming convention.

In 2000, Panin Sekuritas became a publicly listed and traded company at Indonesia Stock Exchange after several years of consistent growth and profit. With this, the company was allowed by Indonesia's capital market and financial institution regulation body to append "Tbk." to its name to describe that it is a public company. Officially renamed to PT. Panin Sekuritas Tbk.
