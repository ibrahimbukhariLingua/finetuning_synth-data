## Overview

KOFIA's goals are to ensure fair business practices among members, the fair trading of securities and investor protection, and the development of the nation’s capital market and financial investment services industry.

KOFIA performs five major functions: self-regulation, market management, upgrading the financial investment industry, the education and training of professionals, and fostering a sound investment culture. As the primary SRO, KOFIA oversees a wide spectrum of areas in the Korean financial investment industry. All securities, asset management and futures firms in Korea are KOFIA members and are subject to KOFIA’s self-regulatory operations.
