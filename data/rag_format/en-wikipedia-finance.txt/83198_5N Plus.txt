It produces tellurium, cadmium, zinc and related compounds of 5N, 6N and 7N purity, as well as selenium, antimony and bismuth of 5N purity. Its products are critical precursors in a number of electronic applications, including the rapidly expanding thin-film photovoltaic market and to the radiation detector market.

5N Plus is an integrated producer with both primary and secondary refining capabilities. 5N Plus' primary refining capabilities are such that it can treat very low-grade metal concentrates, and extract and refine the metals of interest so that they can be fed to its secondary refining operations, where 5N Plus attains a high level of purity. Its primary refining capabilities also enable it to treat complex feeds and very low-grade concentrates containing only small amounts of the metals of interest, and thus provide its customers with recycling solutions.
