# Super 8 (hotel)



**Super 8 by Wyndham**, commonly known as **Super 8**, is an American hotel brand, being the world's largest budget hotel chain with over 2,600 locations worldwide. The chain is a subsidiary of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts. The original room cost was $8.88 per night. As of December 2022, the brand website listed 2,691 hotels worldwide.


## History


### Launch

Ron Rivett and Dennis Brown created the new Super 8 Motel corporation with each of them owning 50% of the stock in the new company. The original room rate was US$8.88 (equivalent to $50.07 in 2021), hence the numeric brand name. The first Super 8, with 60 rooms, opened in Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1974, built near a Holiday Inn with just some drawings made by Rivett as blueprints. The stucco exterior with an English Tudor style was inspired by Rivett's father-in-law, who was a stuccoer; the English Tudor style and placing of Super 8's near Holiday Inns was an established procedure for setting up new Super 8's for years to come.

Dennis Brown died in 1988. The 1,000 locations of the Super 8 chain were sold to Hospitality Franchise Systems, which became Cendant in 1993.

Super 8 had a frequent traveler program, the VIP club, which was introduced in 1976; it grew to over 7.6 million members. The VIP program was dissolved in December 2003 and replaced with the TripRewards program, which was renamed Wyndham Rewards in 2008.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In May 2016, Super 8 remodelled its 1,800 rooms in the US and Canada and organized a big giveaway of old art and furniture.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The brand jokingly organized an exhibition in New York called *When the Art Comes Down: Works from the Super 8 Collection* and featuring 100 pieces of their "not-so-super art", an event organized to communicate on the brand's design overhaul. In December 2016, another edition of the exhibition was organized in Miami.

In November 2016, Super 8 launched a new promotion for US Army veterans which included a reserved parking area in all US and Canada locations.
