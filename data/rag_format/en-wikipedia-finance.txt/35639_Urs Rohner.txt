# Urs Rohner



**Urs Rohner** (born 1959) is a Swiss lawyer, businessman and banker. He is the former CEO of ProSiebenSat.1 Media and former chairman of Swiss bank Credit Suisse. After his 10 year tenure the share price lost 75% of its value leaving the bank engulfed in various scandals and subsequently apologizing for his poor performance at the last shareholder meeting. He is considered one of the worst chairmen in Swiss banking.


## Early life

Rohner was born 1959. He competed as a hurdler in the 1982 European Athletics Championships. He earned a master of laws from the University of Zurich in 1983.


## Career

Rohner served as the chief executive officer of ProSiebenSat.1 Media from 2000 to 2004.


### Credit Suisse, 2004–2021

Rohner became the chief lawyer at Credit Suisse in 2004.

After moving to the company's board of directors, Rohner served as its vice chairman from 2009 to 2011. Since 2011, he has served as its chairman. In 2017, he was criticized by investors for his poor performance. In 2020, shareholders voted to re-elect Rohner for a final term in office with 77.5% support; the 21.6% opposition he faced was the highest in his nearly a decade as chairman. He retired in May 2021 from the Board of Credit Suisse - during his 10 year tenure, the stock price has fallen by over 70%. In the last year of his tenure, Rohner appointed Lara Warner with no prior risk management experience to Chief Risk Officer of the bank in a push for diversity. Consequently, Credit Suisse's clients lost around $3bn due to the collapse of Greensill. Furthermore, with the collapse of Archegos Capital Credit Suisse lost over $5.5bn exposing its weak risk management, which Rohner in the aftermath of the financial crisis promised to reform.
