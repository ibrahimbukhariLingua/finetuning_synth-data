# Mubadala Investment Company



**Mubadala Investment Company PJSC** (Arabic: شركة مبادلة للاستثمار), or simply **Mubadala**, is a state-owned global investment firm that acts as one of the sovereign wealth funds of the government of Abu Dhabi. The company was established in 2017 when then-named Mubadala Development Company (now Mamoura Diversified Global Holding) and the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) merged. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, Mubadala also has offices in London, Rio de Janeiro, New York, San Francisco and Beijing.


## History

Established in 1984, the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) was created to advance Abu Dhabi’s natural petroleum wealth for the development of the emirate. Mubadala Development Company followed in 2002 to further diversify the economy. In June 2016, it was announced that Mubadala Development Company would merge with the International Petroleum Investment Company. In 2017, ownership of both MDC and IPIC was transferred to a newly created parent company, Mubadala Investment Company. The company is a wholly-owned investment vehicle of the government of Abu Dhabi, and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice-president and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, is chairman of the company.


## Investments

Mubadala has invested in logistics software startup Turvo, Alphabet-owned self-driving technology company Waymo, Reliance Jio Platforms, UK life sciences company Envision, and Telegram. Mubadala is a parent company of GlobalFoundries, a semiconductor foundry company.

Mubadala owns stakes in numerous companies, including a 7.5 percent share in the Carlyle Group.

In 2007 Mubadala announced an initial investment in AMD. As of 2017 Mubadala had a stake of 12.9 percent in the chipmaker. In 2019 Mubadala sold its entire stake in AMD.

In November 2020, Mubadala transferred ownership of two information technology companies it previously owned, Injazat and Khazna, to artificial intelligence company, G42, and took a stake in G42.

In 2021, Mubadala purchased a 2.6% stake in En+ Group, a manufacturer of green aluminum, from Polina Yumasheva, the former wife of Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska. The same year, Mubadala purchased MetrôRio, the company that holds the operations for the Rio de Janeiro metro, from Invepar. In 2016, Mubadala became the biggest external shareholder at Investcorp, after acquiring 20% stakes in the Bahraini firm. In 2023, a former UK minister, Gerry Grimstone was criticized for conducting and not declaring 13 meetings with Mubadala and Khaldoon al-Mubarak, after acquiring the role as an adviser and the chair of planned climate fund at Investcorp. In March 2021, Grimstone finalized a deal between the UK and Mubadala, allowing it to oversee investment of around £10 billion in the UK from the UAE. A senior research officer at Transparency International UK, Rose Whiffen said if a minister is working for a firm and meeting its shareholder several times while in office, it should be declared or assessed before approval.

A unit of the company, Mubadala Capital, invested €50 million in the Novalpina Capital private equity fund of €1 billion, which bought the NSO Group in 2019. Reports revealed that the UAE targeted human rights activists, journalists, and Princess Haya using the Pegasus spyware, during the same time. Mubadala Capital got a seat on Novalpina’s committee of largest investors.

In May 2022, Mubadala Investment Company signed a preliminary agreement with French utility Engie for the development of a digital platform to charge electric vehicles in the UAE and across the Middle East. The two companies would also explore areas related to sustainable mobility.

In May 2023, Mubadala agreed to buy a majority stake in a New York–based Fortress Investment Group from the SoftBank Group. The $3 billion takeover was intended to be closed in the first quarter of 2024. However, the deal that would give Mubadala 70% stakes in Fortress was being scrutinized by the U.S. national security officers. The deal, which raised concerns for the US over the UAE's ties with China, was being closely reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius).

In September 2024, Turkish Competition Authority confirmed that Mubadala applied to acquire Getir in entirety. In June 2024, Getir founders, Nazim Salur and Serkan Borancili, opposed Mubadala’s restructuring plan that would separate profitable local grocery delivery operations with noncore businesses. Under the proposed plan, Mubadala was to acquire grocery delivery operations in exchange for $250 million investment. However, in January 2025, Salur alleged Mubadala of an “illegal coup” and vowed to take legal action against the Emirati firm. He claimed that Mubadala attempted to take over all shares of the founders, and “intentionally delayed” transferring units to them. Getir’s founders also stated that Mubadala attempted to back off from the deal at the end of 2024. They appealed to the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal, and said to take a legal action in Turkey and the UK as well. Mubadala was planning to propose an alternative plan, which it said was already approved by Getir’s independent directors. But Salur expressed his intent to “continue fighting” the restructuring plan. On 30 January 2025, Salur removed Getir’s CEO Batuhan Gultakan from his position without giving specific reasons. Sources revealed that the move was taken due to Gultakan’s full support towards Mubadala.
