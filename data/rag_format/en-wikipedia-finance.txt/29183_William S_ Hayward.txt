In 1861, at the start of the Civil War, Hayward moved to Washington, D.C., and opened another bakery branch called "Rhode Island Bakery". It supplied biscuits to soldiers stationed in Washington, D.C. When soldiers moved out of District of Columbia into Virginia early in the war, Howard sold the District of Columbia location at a loss and returned to Providence.

By 1863 Hayward bought out the business and became full owner of Rice Hayward, & Co. He later partnered again with Fitz James Rice. The company was successful. They supplied biscuits to the Union Army stationed in Rhode Island during the Civil War and grew into one of the largest bakeries in New England.
