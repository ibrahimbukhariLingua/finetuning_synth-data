Marvel Animation


# Marvel Animation



**Marvel Animation Inc.** is an American animation production company. It was incorporated on January 25, 2008, to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets. The incorporated Marvel Animation included then ongoing animation efforts by Marvel Studios with Lionsgate and Nickelodeon. Marvel Animation operates under Marvel Studios, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, itself a division of The Walt Disney Company.


## Background

Marvel Comics Group first entered the animated field through licensing to Grantray-Lawrence Animation for *The Marvel Super Heroes* anthology series in 1966–1968, Fantastic Four from 1967 to 1968, and Spider-Man from 1967 to 1969. Marvel worked with Grantray-Lawrence, Hanna-Barbera, and DePatie–Freleng Enterprises on other animated series until 1980.

In 1980, Cadence Industries would purchase the remainder of DePatie–Freleng Enterprises to form Marvel Productions. Marvel Productions was merged into New World Entertainment's operations with the Marvel Entertainment Group's sale to Andrews Group, a Perlman corporation, in 1989. Marvel Productions became New World Animation by 1993.

Marvel Entertainment Group then set up a division, Marvel Films, to work with New World Entertainment's New World Family Filmworks, Inc., both under Avi Arad as president. Marvel Films Animation was set up and produced only a single show, *Spider-Man* in 1994. During this time, New World Animation and Saban Entertainment produced additional shows, with Saban eventually taking over production.

In August 1996, Marvel Entertainment Group decided to incorporate Marvel Films as Marvel Studios with the sale of New World Communications Group, Inc., Marvel's fellow Andrews Group subsidiary in film and television stations, funded with a sale of Toy Biz stock. In July 1996, Fox Children's Network secured rights from Marvel Entertainment Group for *Captain America*, *Daredevil*, *Silver Surfer,* and additional characters to be developed into four series and 52 episodes over seven years.
