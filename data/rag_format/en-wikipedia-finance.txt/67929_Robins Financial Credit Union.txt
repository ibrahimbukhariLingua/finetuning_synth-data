## History

Robins Financial Credit Union was originally founded in February 1954 as Robins Federal Credit Union. A group of 13 Robins Air Force Base civilian and military personnel joined to sign the application for a charter for the credit union. The field of membership requested in the original charter included “civilian employees and commissioned officers of the Department of the Air Force who worked at or had headquarters at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia; employees of this credit union; members of their immediate families; and organizations of such persons.” The charter was approved on March 23, 1954, and Robins Federal Credit Union was officially created on April 1, 1954.

In January 2016, Robins Federal Credit Union converted from a Federal Charter to a State of Georgia Charter, becoming Robins Financial Credit Union. Converting to a state charter allowed the credit union to expand their field of membership.

## Organization

Robins Financial Credit Union is a state-chartered credit union and a member of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Like all credit unions, Robins Financial is governed by a Board of Directors, a volunteer group elected by and from its membership.
As a member-owned, not-for-profit financial cooperative, each member has an ownership stake in the credit union, rather than shareholders like at a bank.
