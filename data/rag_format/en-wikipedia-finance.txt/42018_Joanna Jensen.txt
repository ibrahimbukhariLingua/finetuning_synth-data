## Early life and career

Joanna Jensen is the CEO of Childs Farm Ltd, a prominent UK-based skincare brand Specialising in products for children and individuals with sensitive skin.

Jensen received her education from Canford School. After leaving Canford School in 1988, Joanna began her career in the property sector, working as a letting agent at Kathini Graham Ltd before moving to Hamptons (estate agent) International, where she served as Head of Residential Management and Central London Lettings until 1993. She then founded Joanna Dover Interiors, managing property refurbishments and rentals in London until 1995.

Transitioning into finance, she joined Wheelock NatWest Investment Management in Hong Kong as a marketing specialist and analyst for Japanese heavy industrials. She later became Director and Head of Equity Client Relationship Management at WI Carr in Hong Kong (1996–1998), where she implemented global client management systems. Jensen's expertise grew further at Paribas Investment Bank in London, where she served as Global Head of Equity Client Relationship Management from 1998 to 2000. Her career progressed at UBS Investment Bank in London, where she was executive director from 2000 to 2006, managing equity relationships with senior figures at major Scottish and Swiss fund management institutions, such as Scottish Widows and Credit Suisse Asset Management. Jensen took a career break from 2006 to 2010 to focus on family after the birth of her two daughters, Emilia and Bella.


## Childs Farm

In 2010, Jensen founded Childs Farm, a natural skincare brand, which she started after treating her daughter's eczema with a self-made sensitive skin solution. The Childs Farm brand was introduced in UK retail in 2014, and in 2018, she also established her brand in Australia. In 2022, Childs Farm was awarded B-Corp status, and in the same year, she sold 91.5% of her business to PZ Cussons PLC for £40 million.

## Personal life

Jensen has been engaged in various donations, such as providing £750,000 worth of hand cream to NHS nurses for skin problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurs due to constant handwashing, and offering gifts to children who are admitted in hospitals around Christmas.


## Charity work

Horses have been a permanent feature in Joanna's life and the charities she actively supports reflect this passion.

Joanna's involvement with the British Paralympic Association (BPA) inspired her to offer further support to a charity that relies heavily on donations to bring the National Team together for training and getting them to events around the world. In 2019, she became a founder member of The Parallel Club, a group of individuals that commit to helping the Paralympians of the future obtain the equipment, support and coaching they need to become winners. In 2023, Joanna became the club's Chairman.

Riding for the Disabled Association (RDA) has been a beneficiary of Childs Farm since the company launched in 2011. Joanna is proud to have donated to the construction of the charity's HQ in Worcestershire, as well its annual National Championships and Achievement Awards.

Through RDA, Joanna met Natasha Baker OBE, one of the UK's leading Paralympic Dressage riders. In 2018, Natasha needed help in purchasing a horse for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games. Joanna did not hesitate and helped her to secure her new ride, Lottie (Keystone Dawn Chorus). Natasha went onto win a gold and two silver medals in the Games that were eventually held in 2021.
