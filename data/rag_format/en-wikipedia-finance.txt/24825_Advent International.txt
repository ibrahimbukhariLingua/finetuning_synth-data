Advent is a Boston, Massachusetts spin-out from TA Associates by Peter Brooke.

Didier Lamouche was appointed President of the Executive Board and Marwan Lahoud Chairman of the Supervisory Board of OT-MORPHO.
This acquisition raised a series of concerns:

* Various civil rights organizations have criticized the government's contracts with IDEMIA, expressing concerns about sharing sensitive biometric data with a private and unregulated third-party company.
* Researchers have also found that facial verification and identification algorithms, including IDEMIA's algorithm specifically, exhibit systematic racial and gender bias.
* Another concern is the presence of Marwan Lahoud as a President or member of the board of different entities of the group, since 2017.
* Marwan Lahoud abruptly left Airbus (former EADS) in February 2017, without notice, and is deeply involved in the scandal of corruption which hit Airbus. *"Airbus ran 'massive' bribery scheme to win orders"* (title of the article in the Financial Times of January 31, 2020 in which he is mentioned, with a photo of him with this title: *"Marwan Lahoud, who led the strategy organization and marketing of Airbus, SMO, a division dedicated to securing sales in emerging markets and at the heart of a catalog of offenses."*). In January 2020, the French press announced that the French, British and American courts had validated the agreements made earlier this week by Airbus and the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (PNF), the British Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the Department of Justice ( DOJ) in the United States, under which the European group AIRBUS recognises the fraud and briberies, and undertakes to pay fines totalling 3.6 billion euros: 2.08 billion in France as part of a public interest legal agreement (CJIP ), 984 million in the United Kingdom and 526 million in the United States.
 Today dissolved, the group's unit called Strategy and Marketing Organization (SMO), led by Marwan Lahoud, was at the heart of the matter.
 Almost all the articles published on these agreements underline that the ex-leaders may be worried within the framework of a preliminary investigation still in progress.

In October 2018, Advent acquired the pharmaceutical company Zentiva, previously owned by Sanofi.

On December 20, 2019, the UK government approved Advent's £4 billion takeover of defense supplier Cobham Plc.

On September 16, 2019, at a shareholders' meeting in London, the proposed takeover deal was approved with 93% voting in favor of the deal, surpassing the requisite 75% votes. The takeover was controversial, with opponents of the deal, such as the former First Sea Lord and Royal Navy chief Admiral Lord West of Spithead expressing fears. The founding family of Cobham were also vocal opponents of the takeover. These oppositions for the takeover triggered an investigation by the Competition & Markets Authority, on the national security implications of the transaction, which led to the delay in the regulatory approval of the deal.

The company is following up its $3.3 billion acquisition of Evonik Industries's plastics division.

On March 5, 2021, Advent completed the acquisition of Global Connect business (NielsenIQ, the former ACNielsen) of Nielsen Holdings.
