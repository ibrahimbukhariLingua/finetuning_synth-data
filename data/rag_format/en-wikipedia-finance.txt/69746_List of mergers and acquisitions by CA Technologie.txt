# List of mergers and acquisitions by CA Technologies



CA Technologies, Inc., formerly Computer Associates International and CA, Inc., was an American multinational software company that developed and published enterprise software. Active from 1976 to 2018, the company was co-founded by Charles B. Wang and Russell Artzt. The pair incorporated CA to capitalize on the emerging market of third-party mainframe software. It grew its portfolio and became successful through acquiring many companies in disparate fields, including system monitoring and management, ID management, security, and anti-virus, among others. In 2018, CA itself was acquired by Broadcom Inc. for nearly US$19 billion in cash.
