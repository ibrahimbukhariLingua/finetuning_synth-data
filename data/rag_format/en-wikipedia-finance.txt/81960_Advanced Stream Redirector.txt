Advanced Stream Redirector


# Advanced Stream Redirector



The **Advanced Stream Redirector** (**ASX**) format is a type of XML metafile designed to store a playlist of Windows Media files for a multimedia presentation.

It is used frequently on streaming video servers where multiple *ASF* files are to be played in succession. Both RTSP and MMS streaming protocols are supported, as well as HTTP.

ASX files have MIME type `video/x-ms-asf` (as do ASF files).

With the introduction of the `WMA` and `WMV` container formats in late 1990s, `WAX` and `WVX` extensions have also been introduced by Microsoft respectively.


## Example


## Windows Media Player playlists

ASX can be used to print playlists done with Windows Media Player. To print a playlist, there are two main steps for those people that are familiar with Windows command lines and XSLT:

* Install an XSLT processor
* Export the playlist from the Windows Media Player with: Menu File -> Save current playlist
