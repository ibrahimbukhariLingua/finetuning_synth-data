## Overview

Trymedia was founded in 1999 as Trymedia Systems, Inc. by cousins Alex Torrubia and Andres Torrubia. The company was launched in Spain, and after a round of fund-raising in New York, relocated to San Francisco. Macrovision acquired Trymedia for US$34 million on July 26, 2005. With the acquisition, Macrovision launched a new games division, Trymedia Games Division, based around Trymedia employees. Trymedia was not a profitable operation, losing $14.5 million on revenue of just over $9 million in 2007. On February 22, 2008, RealNetworks announced it had acquired Trymedia from Macrovision for an undisclosed sum, reported in a Macrovision conference call to be $4million.

Trymedia operates an online network of digitally distributed computer games. The network is integrated into Microsoft's digital locker service, and provides white label online retail services to affiliates such as Electronics Boutique and GameSpot.
