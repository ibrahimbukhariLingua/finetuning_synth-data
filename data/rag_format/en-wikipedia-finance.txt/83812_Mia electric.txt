# Mia electric



**Mia Electric** was a French electric car manufacturer in the 2010s. The company, based in Cerizay, France, designed and built electric vehicles made totally in France.

The Mia was the company's first all-electric model on the market. The car has a 9.7 kW (13 hp) electric motor with an 8 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP) battery pack that delivers a range of 90 km (56 mi), and a maximum speed of 100 km/h (62 mph).

Production began in June 2011, and sales to the public started in 2012. Production stopped in December 2013 due to financial problems. The *Tribunal de Commerce de Niort* placed the company in judicial liquidation in March 2014.


## Specifications and models

Mia electric is offered in three trims:

* Mia,
* Mia L,
* Mia U (formerly Mia K)

All versions have two battery options, as the standard 8 kWh battery can be replaced by a larger 12 kWh battery, allowing an increase in range from 80 to 90 km (50 to 56 mi) to 120 to 130 km (75 to 81 mi). The battery pack has a 3-year warranty period. Maximum range figures are based on the NEDC test procedures and may be less in cold weather or if the vehicle is loaded. All models have a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph).

The short Mia is a three-seater, measuring 2.87 m (9 ft 5 in), with two sliding doors and the driver seat located in the center. The price starts at €12,255 (US$16,532) excluding VAT and government purchase assistance for low carbon vehicles. The Mia L has four seats and a longer wheelbase measuring 3.19 m (10.5 ft), and pricing starts at €12,781 (US$17,241). The Mia U is a box van with only the driver's seat and also has a length of 3.19 m (10.5 ft), and pricing starts at €11,730 (US$15,823). The cargo capacity of the Mia U is over 1,500 litres (330 imp gal; 400 US gal). All three models comply with the European safety standards for passenger vehicles, and therefore are considered highway-capable. In addition to a central airbag for the driver and seats with three-point safety belts, the standard equipment for the Mia includes an Anti-lock braking system (ABS) and emergency brake assist (EBA).
