Stamford International University


# Stamford International University



**Stamford International University Thailand** (STIU) (Thai: มหาวิทยาลัยนานาชาติแสตมฟอร์ด) is a private for-profit international university with an enrollment of over 4,000 students.


## Historical background

Stamford College was established in Singapore and Malaysia in 1950. Subsequently a campus under the name of Stamford International College was opened in Thailand in 1995 as a joint venture with Far East Stamford International Co. Ltd.

While the institution was started with an English-based international curriculum, parallel courses in Thai language were introduced along the way. Credits can be transferred worldwide to (and from) colleges and universities at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

The university established an academic collaboration agreement with Schiller International University of the United States in 2000 and was renamed Schiller-Stamford International College on 2 August 2000. Students at STIU (Cha-am), have an opportunity to study at any of the eight campuses of Schiller in Europe or the United States, through programmes offered under the students exchange agreement between the two universities.

STIU underwent several changes in its name in the process of becoming to a full university, a status which was granted by the Ministry of University Affairs on 14 February 2003, resulting in a renaming to Schiller-Stamford International University. STIU achieved autonomy on 26 May 2004 and was re-branded as Stamford International University.

On 29 September 2008, STIU underwent a re-branding programme, including the logo, the symbol, official colours and motto.


## The Laureate partnership

In late-2011, STIU became a partner of Laureate International Universities, an academic network of 60 universities in 29 countries serving more than 675,000 students around the world.

STIU currently has students from as many as 56 countries. On 13 February 2019, it was announced that Laureate divested the entirety of its 100% shares to China YuHua Education Corporation Limited for approximately US$28 million.
