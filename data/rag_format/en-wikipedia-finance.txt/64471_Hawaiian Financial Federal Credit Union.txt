## History

In October 22, 1936, **Mutelco Oahu Employees Federal Credit Union** was formed by 65 employees of Mutual Telephone Company. In 1954, the credit union officially changed its name to Hawaiian Tel Employees Federal Credit Union (HTEFCU). Although operating with only volunteers and unpaid staff, the credit union was successful in reaching $1 million USD in assets in the next year and $2 million USD in assets by 1961. In addition, HTEFCU extended their operations to the neighbor islands of Hawaii.
In 1971, the credit union officially became a completely independent entity from the phone company while continuing to serve the company’s employees and their families as well as other members.

Throughout the 1980s, HiTel FCU continued its dynamic growth into a full service financial provider while keeping quality member service as its focal point. Services, products and programs were developed and implemented to meet the ever-changing needs of the membership. In 1999, HTEFCU changed its field of membership to serve Oahu's community and their families.

At the Credit Union’s 2003 Annual Meeting, it was announced that the word “Employees” had been removed from its name, and that the organization’s new name would officially be Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union.

The company renamed itself again in August 2018 as "Hawaiian Financial Federal Credit Union."
