In 1956, Erpf invested in the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company after it ceased publication of Collier's magazine. Under his financial guidance, Crowell-Collier went from the verge of bankruptcy to making a $4 million profit in five years' time. Erpf encouraged the company to use its profits from the sales of Collier's Encyclopedia to purchase Macmillan Inc. in 1960, Brentano's bookstores, Berlitz School of Languages, and Berlitz Publications in quick procession, turning it into one of the nation's largest publishers.

Erpf collected contemporary artworks. He once commissioned the British sculptor and writer Michael Ayrton to build a maze on his Upstate New York estate upon reading his book *The Maze Maker*. In 1968, a gigantic maze consisting of 1680 feet of stone pathways and brick walls eight feet high at two hundred feet in diameter was built, with a seven-foot bronze Minotaur and a seven-foot bronze of Daedelus and Icarus in two central chambers. According to Christie's, it was the largest labyrinth built since classical antiquity.

His art collections were donated to the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art after his death.
