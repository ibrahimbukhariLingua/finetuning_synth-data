Sinogold was founded by Zhongwei Wang in 2016, and is based in Shandong. Sinogold joined with Shandong Guojin (Kingold) Automobile Manufacturing Co. in May 2016. Sinogold's factory stamps, welds, assembles, and paints all Sinogold vehicles.

Sinogold produced the K01 and the K03 in 2016, but they both failed to enter production. They later became the GM3.

There first production vehicle was the G60, which was later renamed the Sinogold GM3. It came out in 2017 and was a compact MPV heavily inspired by the Citroen Grand C4 Picasso. Its dimensions are 4,615 mm/1,845 mm/1,655 mm, and a top speed of 150 kilometres per hour. In May 2017, Sinogold was sued for advertising a picture of the Citroen C4 instead of the Sinogold GM3.
