# Jollibee Foods Corporation



**Jollibee Foods Corporation** (abbreviated as **JFC** and **Jollibee Group**; also known as **Jollibee** after its primary fast food brand) is a Philippine multinational company headquartered in Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines. JFC is the owner of the fast food brand Jollibee.

With the success of its flagship brand, JFC acquired some of its competitors in the fast food business in the Philippines and abroad such as Chowking, Greenwich, Red Ribbon, and Mang Inasal. As of September 2022,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ JFC operates more than 6,300 stores worldwide, with system-wide retail sales totaling ₱210.9 billion.


## Background

In 1975, Tony Tan Caktiong and his family opened a Magnolia Ice Cream parlor in Cubao, Quezon City which is credited as the first Jollibee outlet. The Magnolia outlets operated by the Tan Caktiong clan began offering hot meals and sandwiches upon request from the customers which the family found out to be more popular than the franchise's ice cream. In 1978, the family decided to cancel the Magnolia franchise and converted the ice cream parlors they operated into fast food outlets. Management consultant Manuel C. Lumba advised the family on the move.

The Jollibee Foods Corporation was incorporated in January 1978. It opened its first store overseas opened in Singapore in 1985 at the Katong Shopping Centre; that location closed only a year later

Jollibee experienced rapid growth. It was able to withstand the entry of McDonald's in the Philippines in 1981 by focusing on the specific tastes of the Filipino market, which differed from the American fast food company. On July 13, 1993, JFC was listed at the Philippine Stock Exchange.

In 2011, JFC opened 260 new stores, of which 167 were in the Philippines led by Mang Inasal (86) and Jollibee (40). This brought the company's total number of stores to 2,001 as of the end of December 2011. The same year, Jollibee closed Manong Pepe foodchain in favor of Mang Inasal, and sold Délifrance to CaféFrance. Overseas, Jollibee opened 93 stores, led by Yonghe King in China (70) and Jollibee Vietnam (11).

It has 1,668 locations across 17 countries as of July, 2024 with its recent opening in Canada, the brand's 100th store in North America.


### Data breaches

In December 2017, JFC was a victim of a data breach by hackers who gained access to the customer database of the Jollibee website. In May 2018, Jollibee's online food delivery operations were suspended as a result of the breach, in compliance with the National Privacy Commission's directive.

In June 2024, the company was a victim of another data breach by hackers which affected its 32 million food delivery service customers.
