# Hvalur hf.



**Hvalur hf.** (Icelandic pronunciation: [ˈkʰvaːlʏr̥], lit. 'Whale') is an Icelandic commercial whaling and holding company. Hvalur hf. was founded in 1947 as a commercial whaling company by Loftur Bjarnason and Vilhjálmur Árnason and later run by their sons, Kristján Loftsson and Árni Vilhjálmsson. In the recent decades, it has become one of the most powerful investment companies in Iceland, having owned large shares in Arion Bank, Marel, Origo hf. and Brim hf. amongst others.

In 1948, the company purchased an American naval base at Hvalfjörður (Whale Fjord) and converted it into a whaling station. Norwegian crews were involved in training Icelandic whalers into the early 1950s.

The company currently operates two whaling ships, *Hvalur 8* and *Hvalur 9*. It further owns two more, *Hvalur 6* and *Hvalur 7*, that where never fully repaired following the 1986 Hvalur sinkings.

## Controversies

On June 20th, 2023, the Icelandic Minister of Fisheries, Svandís Svavarsdóttir, temporarily halted whaling until 31 August 2023 due to alleged violations of the Icelandic Animal Welfare Act by whalers of Hvalur ehf. On 1 September the same year, whaling resumed again with stricter conditions.
