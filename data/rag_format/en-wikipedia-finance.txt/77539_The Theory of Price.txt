The Theory of Price


# The Theory of Price



***The Theory of Price*** is a book written by George Stigler. The book was first published in 1946, as a revision and expansion of *The Theory of Competitive Price* (1942), and has since been revised and reprinted several times (1942, 1946, 1952, 1966, and 1987). The book covers a range of topics related to microeconomics. Stigler's book was an advanced economics textbook originally intended for graduate students. Over time, it evolved and became *The Theory of Price*, expanding its scope and becoming a standard text at the undergraduate level. Stigler's work transitioned from the influence of Alfred Marshall and the inter-war School of economics to the post-WWII Chicago School, showing a shift towards greater analytical rigor and the use of mathematics. Throughout its editions, Stigler emphasized precision and positive theory.

According to Ronald Coase, while it's a challenging yet valuable resource for aspiring economists, the textbook isn't where Stiglerâ€™s most innovative economic contributions are found, which explains why it wasn't a focus when he received the Nobel Prize. Although engaging and witty, the book covers conventional topics expected in price theory, not groundbreaking work.
