## Hazard controls

The US's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance for businesses and employers on COVID-19 prevention and management measures in the workplace. Engineering controls such as altered workspaces to allow physical distancing, plexiglass barriers, and improved ventilation were recommended. Administration controls such as training, symptom screening, routine cleaning, avoiding shared equipment and office space, staggered shifts, and flexible sick leave policies were strategies to keep employees safe and healthy. Personal protective equipment such as face coverings or gloves were deemed necessary depending on the job tasks.

Efforts to encourage social distancing to reduce airborne transmission affected spatial design principles used by retailers.
