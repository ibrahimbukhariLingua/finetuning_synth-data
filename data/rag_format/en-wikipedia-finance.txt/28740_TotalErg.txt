## History

The company, born on 1 October 2010 from the merger of Total Italia S.p.A. with Erg Petroli S.p.A., operated in five business areas: *Refining*, *Supply and Logistics*; *Net*; *Wholesale*; *Speciality*. With a network of around 2,600 distributors, fuel sales of over 3 billion liters and a market share of around 11%, TotalErg was one of the main operators in the sector. In the *Wholesale* sector, TotalErg marketed over 1.5 million tonnes of fuels and combustibles - diesel, fuel oils, petrol - for industrial, civil and agricultural use, selling both to retailers in the sector and directly to consumers through the subsidiary Eridis.

In the *Specialty* sector it markets bitumen and modified bitumen.

On 10 January 2018 TotalErg was acquired by Gruppo API, with the exception of the *Special Fluids* division, acquired by the newly formed Total Italia, and the subsidiary Totalgaz Italia, sold to the UGI Corporation and renamed UniverGas Italia.

All TotalErg stations will be progressively replaced by those bearing the IP Gruppo API brand.

In 2019, the reverse merger of Anonima Petroli Italiana into TotalErg took place, and the company took on the name Italiana Petroli.
