Tuscan lira


# Tuscan lira



The **lira** (plural: *lire*) was the currency of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until its annexation by Napoleonic France in 1807. After that year, it unofficially remained in circulation thanks to its silver value until the restoration of Tuscan independence in 1814. It was finally abolished in 1826.


## History

It was subdivided into 20 *soldi*, each of 3 *quattrini* or 12 *denari* (singular: *soldo*, *quattrino*, *denaro*). Other denominations included the *crazia* worth q.5; the *grosso* worth q.20; the *paolo* worth q.40 or 2⁄3 lira; the *testone* worth 3 paoli; and the crown-sized *francescone* worth 10 paoli or 6+2⁄3 lire.

In 1803 the Tuscan lira was equivalent to 0.84 French francs, 0.84 Italian lira, or 3.78 grams of fine silver. In 1826 it was replaced by the Tuscan fiorino worth 100 quattrini or 1+2⁄3 lira.


## Coins

In the late 18th century, copper coins circulated in denominations of q.1, q.2, and s.1, together with billon q.10 and silver 1⁄2, 1, 2, 5 and 10 paoli. In the early 19th century, copper s.1⁄2 and s.2 were added, together with silver 1 lira and 10 lire.

The 10-lira coin was known as **dena** and the 5-lira coin was known as **meza-dena** ("half-dena").
