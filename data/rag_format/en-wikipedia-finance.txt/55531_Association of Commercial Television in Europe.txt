Association of Commercial Television in Europe


# Association of Commercial Television in Europe



**The Association of Commercial Television and Video on Demand Services in Europe (ACT)** represents the interests of leading commercial broadcasters present across the European Union and beyond. The ACT member companies finance, produce, promote and distribute content and services benefiting millions of Europeans across all platforms. By offering a wide range of choice and variety to the viewer, commercial broadcasters are a leading source of entertainment and information to millions of European citizens.


## History

The ACT was set up in 1989, with fewer than 100 broadcasters in the twelve member states of the European Community. With the occasional exception, most European countries had only ended the state monopoly of television broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Back then, the ACT had five founder members. As commercial television models proved popular with viewers, so many new channels were launched, and ACT membership grew quickly. However, some of the key regulatory issues were already becoming apparent, with European rules adopted for the first time in 1989 on transfrontier television, advertising, programme quotas, and then separate rules negotiated for copyright in the early 1990s.


## Mission

The ACT's role is to protect and to promote the interests of European private broadcasters. ACT engages with the European Union's institutions to achieve a balanced and appropriate regulatory framework which will encourage further investment and growth in the audiovisual sector. This allows the commercial audiovisual industry sector to deliver high-quality and diverse content, as well as trusted news, to viewers.
ACT monitors policy developments at European level and provides its members with regulatory expertise. ACT also engages with European decision makers and engages in a constant dialogue while providing them with the first-hand expertise about the audiovisual sector. Furthermore, ACT is a leading platform for its members to network and exchange ideas about latest policy developments and best practices. ACT represents the industry at external public events, institutional working groups, European and international organisations.


## EU media policy

The ACT promotes and advocates the interests of its member companies in a wide range of media policy issues at European level. ACT activities aim at a balanced and appropriate regulatory framework which will encourage further investment and growth in the audiovisual sector.
ACT responds to relevant consultations, inquiries and maintains dialogue with the European institutions. Key policy areas of focus are intellectual property, Audiovisual media law and data law.
