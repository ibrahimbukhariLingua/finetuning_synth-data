## Early life and career

Klasen was born in Trier, Germany, where he first attended the Humboldt-Gymnasium (then Hindenburg-Gymnasium) in Trier. From 1983 to 1985 he attended the Armand Hammer United World College in New Mexico, where he completed his International Baccalaureate. He then did his community service in the care of the severely disabled in Germany.

Klasen obtained his B.A. in economics from Harvard College from 1987 to 1991, and his Ph.D. in economics from 1991 to 1994 from Harvard University under the supervision of Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, with the topic of an economic analysis of gender inequality in intra-household resource allocation in 18th and 19th century Europe and in contemporary developing countries.

After completing his dissertation, Klasen began working as an economist at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. in 1994. In 1995, he moved to Johannesburg to begin work as a consultant to the South African government and supervisor of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. From 1996 to 1998, he worked as a research associate and deputy director in the Center for History and Economics at Cambridge University. From 1998 to 2003, he worked at the University of Munich as Professor of Economics. Since 2003, he has worked at the University of Göttingen as a professor of economics. There, Klasen was additionally Dean of the Faculty of Economics from 2007 to 2008.

In addition to these activities, Klasen has worked for various organizations, mostly in an advisory role, such as the World Bank, DFID, UNDP, IPCC, BMZ, OECD, UNESCO, KfW and FAO.

In 2016, he received the Special Award of the board of trustees of the University of Göttingen for the development of development economics in Göttingen.

Klasen was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Jaume I University in 2018.

He fell ill with amyothrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2015, which caused him to retire early. As part of his farewell lecture, his contribution to the establishment of development economics in Göttingen was acknowledged. The University of Göttingen established the "Stephan Klasen Fellowship" in his honor, which allows two postdocs from low- or middle-income countries to study at the University of Göttingen for one year.

Klasen was married and had four children. He died in Göttingen on October 27, 2020.
