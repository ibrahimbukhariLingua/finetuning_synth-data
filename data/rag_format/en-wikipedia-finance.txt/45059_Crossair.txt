Crossair


# Crossair



**Crossair Ltd. Co. for Regional European Air Transport** (German: *Crossair AG für europäischen Regionalluftverkehr*) was a Swiss regional airline headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel, Switzerland.

After taking over most of the assets of Swissair following that airline's bankruptcy in 2002, Crossair was restructured to become Swiss International Air Lines.


## History

The airline was founded as a private company under the name *Business Flyers Basel AG* in 1975 by Moritz Suter. The name later changed to *Crossair* on 18 November 1978, before the beginning of scheduled services on 2 July 1979, with flights from Zürich to Nuremberg, Innsbruck and Klagenfurt.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It was headquartered at Zurich Airport in Kloten in 1985.

It added charter services for major shareholder Swissair in November 1995.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

After parent company SAirGroup had to apply for a debt restructuring moratorium in October 2001, it became necessary to change the entire planning. On 31 March 2002, Swissair ceased all operations while most of its assets were taken over by Crossair which then was subsequently restructured and rebranded to become Swiss International Air Lines.


## Head office

Crossair was headquartered on the grounds of EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg in Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin, France, near Basel, Switzerland. In 2002 the name "Crossair" was replaced with "Swiss International Air Lines" on the head office building.


## Destinations

Crossair flew from Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lugano and Zurich. Crossair was very interested in serving from several hubs and, therefore set up a multi-hub business plan. Crossair set up a Eurocross scheme from their Basel base to serve smaller airports and transfer their passengers to larger hubs with short transit times (only around 20 minutes) This helped Crossair link with partners, such as Swissair from Zurich. Crossair also operated flights between Swiss airports.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
