# Sheffield and Hallamshire Bank



The **Sheffield and Hallamshire Bank** operated in Sheffield between 1836 and 1913.


## History

It was founded by the directors and shareholders of the Huddersfield Banking Company. The bank opened for business on 23 May 1836 at Hartsead, Sheffield.

The main office was constructed in Church Street, Sheffield to the designs of the architect Samuel Worth and was opened in 1838. This new building was erected at a cost of Â£5,782. It was extended by the architect Henry Dent Lomas in 1878, and restored after damage during the Second World War.

Initially the bank remained with a single office in the centre of Sheffield but during the 1890s opened branches in suburban Sheffield, and later Chesterfield and Rotherham.

In June 1913 an amalgamation with the London City and Midland Bank was agreed, and the Sheffield and Hallamshire Bank was subsumed into this much larger business.
