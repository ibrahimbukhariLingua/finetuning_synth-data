It is one of the largest financial institutions in Poland and in Central and Eastern Europe.

PKO BP provides services to both individual and business clients, with a core business in Polish retail banking. As of 2018, it had 1,145 branches located in Poland and abroad and a market capitalization of 52 billion Polish złoty, equivalent to 13.8 billion US dollar.


## History

On 7 February 1919, by the order of the Head of State Józef Piłsudski, the Postal Savings Bank was created. Its first director was appointed on 28 December 1919, Hubert Linde [pl]. For many years during the Second Polish Republic, Henryk Gruber [pl] was the president of the PKO. With time, a bank's head office was established in Warsaw with headquarters at ul. Świętokrzyska 31/33 and the first local branches: in Kraków, Lwów, Łódź, Poznań, and Katowice. From 1920, the bank had a legal personality as a state institution.

The employees of the funds were associated in the Association of Postal Savers Workers, which had their own wheels at larger branches,ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ e.g. in Warsaw, in Łódź.

During the German occupation of Poland, in the Second World War, Bank Polski operated under German management.

In 1945, the cash register activity was resumed. On 1 January 1950, the Postal Savings Fund was liquidated, and its agencies were taken over by the General Savings Bank (Polish: *Powszechna Kasa Oszczędności*). In 1974, the PKO offer was enriched with a savings and settlement account for natural persons (commonly known as ROR).

From 1975 to 1987, the PKO branches operated within the structures of the National Bank of Poland, retaining their identity.
On 1 November 1987, PKO Bank Polski became an independent bank again, as part of the economic reforms implemented by the communist government of Poland in its last years.

In 2019, they were announced the title sponsor for the Polish Ekstraklasa.

On 2 February 2024 the bank dismissed eight out of eleven members of the supervisory board. 5 days later, on 7 February 2024, the CEO of the bank Darius Szwed resigned, leaving the bank the following week. On 15 February Szymon Midera was appointed as acting CEO.
