The Republic of Tea


# The Republic of Tea



**The Republic of Tea** is a privately owned American tea company based in Larkspur, California, that makes and sells more than 350 varieties of teas throughout North America. It was one of the first companies to offer varieties such as rooibos red tea, white tea, and tea seed oil to American consumers.


## History

The company was founded in 1992 by Mel Ziegler, Patricia Ziegler, and Bill Rosenzweig. The Zieglers co-founded Banana Republic and ZoZa.com. In 1994, they sold the company to Ron Rubin. Rubin's son Todd Rubin joined the company in 2007 and succeeded his father as president in 2015. Ron Rubin currently serves as The Republic of Tea's Executive Chairman and Minister of Tea. The Republic of Tea designates its employees as "ministers", its customers as "citizens", and its retail outlets as "embassies".


## Practices

The Republic of Tea's products are distributed through speciality retailers including Whole Foods Market and Williams Sonoma. They do not intend to expand to mass market retailers such as Costco and Walmart. The company prides itself on maintaining slow but steady growth and operating without any debt.

The company supports sustainable agriculture. It sources several of its teas from biodynamic farms, a form of alternative agriculture based on pseudo-scientific and esoteric concepts. It also produces Sonoma Teas, which are made from dried grape skins that would otherwise go to waste. Prioritizing fair-trade and organic farms, the company emphasizes sustainability and the well-being of its sourcing regions and farmers. Their slogan, "Sip By Sip Rather Than Gulp by Gulp", promotes mindfulness in tea consumption. Rigorous testing is conducted at both tea garden sites and their packing facility in southern Illinois to ensure product safety.

Both Ron and Todd Rubin have said that they are not interested in selling The Republic of Tea, despite a potential valuation as high as $125 million. Ron Rubin says he has always hoped his company would remain family-owned and private.
