# J.G. Wentworth



**The J.G. Wentworth Company** is an American financial services company that purchases structured settlements, annuities, and lottery payments in exchange for a lump-sum cash settlement. They also offer debt counseling and negotiation services.

The company is known for its television advertisements featuring "Mr. Wentworth", and a series featuring performances of a lengthy jingle performed in several styles, including Wagnerian opera singers.


## History

J.G. Wentworth was formed by James D. Delaney and Gary Veloric in 1991 as a merchant bank specializing in transactions in the healthcare industry. In 1992, the company began to purchase New Jersey auto insurance deferrals from claimants who could not afford to wait twelve to eighteen months for their settlements. According to *Consumer Reports*, as of 2010, J.G. Wentworth customers paid an "effective discount rate" amounting to "9 percent to 15 percent or more"; i.e., customers give up 9–15 percent of their future payments in exchange for a present-day cash amount. Though this might be considered a high fee, *Consumer Reports* says it could be preferable to surrender fees for annuities or other alternatives.

Prior to 1999, there was no regulation for structured settlements in the state of New York. Eliot Spitzer, then New York's state Attorney General, entered into a contract with J.G. Wentworth to regulate the industry and limit fees. The agreement stipulated that J.G. Wentworth could receive a rate of no more than twenty-five percent of the annual discount rate of annuities it had purchased from citizens of the state of New York. At the time, a JGW executive told the *New York Times* that the firm sought the agreement because of the rate at which its business had grown.

In May 2009, J.G. Wentworth's parent company, JGW Holdco LLC, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection partly as a consequence of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The company cited "liquidity problems amid a tightening credit market" as the motive for filing. In June 2009, JGW Holdco LLC received $100 million in equity from primary stakeholder JLL Partners, which allowed the company and its subsidiaries to emerge from bankruptcy.

In 2011, J.G. Wentworth and similar business Peachtree Financial Solutions, formed a new holding company, JGWPT Holdings LLC. The two companies continued to operate independently after the transition.

In October 2013, the firm filed for an initial public offering, which was offered the subsequent month. The company was initially listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JGWE.

In 2015, J.G. Wentworth expanded their financial offerings with the purchase of WestStar Mortgage for US$44 million in common shares and cash. In the same year, the company announced a partnership with Visa to offer a prepaid card to customers.

In June 2016, J.G. Wentworth was delisted from the NYSE for failing to satisfy the continued listing rule of having an average 30-day market capitalization of at least $15 million. Later that month, the company began trading on the OTC Markets Group under the symbol JGWE.

On November 8, 2017, J.G. Wentworth filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in nine years. JGWE stock plummeted by as much as eighty-seven percent on November 10, 2017. The company was expected to emerge from bankruptcy in or around January 2018 after coming to an agreement with lenders prior to filing.
