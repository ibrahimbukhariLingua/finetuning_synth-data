# Trodat



**Trodat, Inc.** is an Austrian multinational company which claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of rubber stamps (base sales). Trodat has its company headquarters in Wels, Austria, and employs more than 1,000 people worldwide.


## History

Trodat Trotec Group was founded in Vienna, Austria, in 1912, with the founding of the sole proprietorship of Franz Just & Söhne.

In 1951, the company relocated to the American occupation zone in Upper Austria, subsequently completing the first exports to Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.

The company's current name is derived from a product designation. During 1947 and 1948, the first plastic date stamp with the Trodat name was produced. Trodat is a portmanteau of "TRO", standing for Trolitul, a plastic previously used for stamp manufacture, and "DAT", for date stamp. After rebranding in the late 1960s, Trodat became the official company name.

## Trodat Company Museum - Villa Muthesius

The Trodat Company Museum is housed by the Villa at No. 4 Pollheimerstraße. It was originally built for the leather manufacturer Ploberger located near the mill creek in Wels, opposite the Ledererturm, between 1916 and 1918. Trodat purchased it in 1997 and renovated it. The building was designed by Hermann Muthesius (1861-1927), who was also the founder of the Deutscher Werkbund (German Association of Craftsmen).
The former Samitz Villa (at the time, the office of an ENT doctor) is known today as Villa Muthesius and operated by lebensspuren - Der Verein für Kunst & Kultur. The association, which was founded in 2016, uses the two halls of the Villa as event spaces.
