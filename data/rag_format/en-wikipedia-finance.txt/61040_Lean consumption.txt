Lean consumption


# Lean consumption



**Lean consumption** is based on lean manufacturing, also known as lean production. Lean Manufacturing was pioneered by Toyota founder Taiichi Ohno, and revolutionized and streamlined the manufacturing industry. Whereas lean manufacturing set out ways to streamline manufacturing processes, lean consumption "minimizes customers' time and effort by delivering exactly what they want when and where they want it". Processes are focused on eliminating waste, while increasing productivity, speed of operation and improving customer interaction.


## History

In the fall of 2005, James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones published an article in the *Harvard Business Review* describing a new theory called *Lean Consumption*. This process was proposed for large corporations, but smaller corporations have been able to take this theory and apply it to small business. This has the effect of more efficient business and better customer service and SLAs.
