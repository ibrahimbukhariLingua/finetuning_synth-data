# Shanta Gold



**Shanta Gold Limited** is a gold mining company, registered in Guernsey in the Channel Islands but which operates in Tanzania. The company is listed on AIM on the London Stock Exchange (symbol: LON:SHG) and had a market capitalisation of £63.5M as of 18 September 2013. The Tanzanian offices are in Dar Es Salaam. Its bankers are UBS.


## Overview

Shanta Gold is incorporated in Guernsey and maintains an office in Saint Peter Port. Shanta's most important project is New Luika Gold Mine, in the Lupa Gold Field of south western Tanzania, which saw its first gold pour in August 2012. The company's mines are all currently in Tanzania but projects elsewhere in East Africa are envisaged. Shanta sub-contracts all aspects of the mining process in order to shorten the time taken for a new mine to become productive.

On 20 December 2023, Shanta Gold agreed to a £142 million buyout offer from Tanzania-based Saturn Resources, leading to the removal of its AIM listing.
