## History

National Bank of Malawi traces its history from the 1890s when African Lakes Corporation established banking business in Nyasaland. In 1918, the National Bank of South Africa (now First National Bank) acquired the banking business of African Lakes Corporation in the colony. In 1925, National Bank of South Africa was merged with the *Anglo-Egyptian Bank* and the *Colonial Bank* in 1925 to form Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas). Barclays thus inherited the National Bank of South Africa's business in the colony.

The current bank was established in 1971 when Standard Bank of Malawi, with the consent of the Government of Malawi, merged with Barclays Bank of Malawi. In July 1971, the merger was effected, with Standard and Barclays jointly owning 51% of the new bank i.e. 25.5% each. Press Holdings Limited, a private Malawian investment company owned 29% and Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC), a Malawian parastatal, owned 20%. Over the years, both Standard Bank and Barclays Bank divested from NBM and Old Mutual Group, became an investor in the bank.

In August 2000, the stock of National Bank of Malawi became listed on the Malawi Stock Exchange, where it trades under the symbol NBM. At the time of listing, the bank issued 45 million ordinary shares.
