## History

In November 2009, entrepreneur Dmitry Sergeev founded Depositphotos in Kyiv, Ukraine. In 2011, Depositphotos received $3 million in Series A funding from AIM-listed TMT investments.

In 2013, in direct competition with Foap and EyeEm Depositphotos launched Clashot, a service to sell and purchase mobile stock photographs that received the Best Mobile App award at Microstock Expo in Berlin.

During 2013, the Depositphotos library grew to 20 million files and registered their one-millionth client. The same year Forbes Ukraine gave the microstock agency a valuation of nearly $100 million. In 2014, Depositphotos launched Bird In Flight, an online magazine about photography and visual culture, which also includes the online magazine WAS and an international photography award "Bird In Flight Prize".

The company's second major investment was from the EBRD and TMT Investments in December 2015. The following year, the library size grew to 50 million files and the company launched Enterprise Solution, a platform for corporate clients and more efficient team collaboration.

In 2017, Depositphotos announced the release of Crello, an online graphic design tool with ready-made templates to create designs without professional skills. The same year, the company opened Lightfield Productions, the biggest photography studio in Eastern Europe.

The Depositphotos library celebrated 100 million files in 2019. Crello, one of the brands of Depositphotos, released their mobile applications for iOS and Android. In 2019, the Clashot application was terminated.

In October 2021, Depositphotos and all subsidiaries was acquired by Vistaprint for a total price of $85 million. Crello will be renamed to VistaCreate. Vadim Nekhai, ex-CEO of Despositphotos, becomes the VP of VistaCreate.
