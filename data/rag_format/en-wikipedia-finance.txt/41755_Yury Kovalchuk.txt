Yury Kovalchuk


# Yury Kovalchuk



**Yury Valentinovich Kovalchuk** (Russian: Ю́рий Валенти́нович Ковальчу́к; born 25 July 1951) is a Russian billionaire businessman and financier who is "reputed to be Vladimir Putin's personal banker". The Panama Papers leak revealed that Kovalchuk had transferred at least $1 billion to an offshore entity.

Kovalchuk is a close friend of Putin: he hosted the wedding of Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova to Kirill Shamalov at his ski resort, Igora, in 2013.

According to journalist Mikhail Zygar, Kovalchuk could probably be called Number 2 in today's Russia. While self-isolating from COVID-19 in 2020, Putin spent much time with Kovalchuk, and they share the view that the only important factor is to restore Russian greatness. According to some experts, Kovalchuk played a role in Putin's decision to invade Ukraine in 2022.


## Life

Yuri Kovalchuk spent his childhood and youth in Leningrad. He was the second child in a family of history teachers. His father, Valentin Mikhailovich Kovalchuk, is Russian, and his mother, Miriam Abramovna Kovalchuk (née Viro), is Jewish. His brother Mikhail is five years older than him.

From 1987 to 1991, he was the first deputy director of Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute.

In 1992, Kovalchuk was a founder of the STREAM Corporation (Russian: ЗАО "Корпорация "СТРИМ").

Kovalchuk is very closely associated with Vladimir Stolyarenko.

Since the early 1990s, Kovalchuk has owned a dacha in Solovyovka in the Priozersky District of the Leningrad region, located on the eastern shore of the Komsomolskoye lake on the Karelian Isthmus near Saint Petersburg. His neighbours there are Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Yakunin, Andrei Fursenko, Sergey Fursenko, Viktor Myachin, Vladimir Smirnov and Nikolay Shamalov. Together they instituted the co-operative society Ozero (the Lake) which united their properties on 10 November 1996.

In November 2000, he was a main shareholder of the Brewery "Baltika" (Russian: пивоваренная компания "Балтика"). Since 2004, he has been chair of Rossiya Bank and its largest shareholder.

The May 2008 issue of Russian *Forbes* listed him for the first time in its *Golden Hundred* of Russia's richest, calling him and another new entrant to the *List*, Gennady Timchenko, "good acquaintances of Vladimir Putin." The magazine placed him at number 53 on the Russians-only list, with an estimated fortune of $1.9 billion. After sanctions imposed on Kovalchuk in 2018, this dropped to $650 million.

His elder brother Mikhail Kovalchuk is the scientific secretary of the Council for Science and High Technologies attached to the president of the Russian Federation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2015, Yury Kovalchuk's National Media Group (NMG) and US Discovery Channel joined forces to form Media Alliance of which NMG owns 80%. Later that year, Kovalchuk acquired the rights to Ted Turner's Russian assets including the Russian version of CNN, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. The reason for the sale was based on the Russian media ownership law that limits ownership of Russian media by foreigners.

In 2017, Kovalchuk purchased the century-old Novy Svet vineyard in Crimea for $26.4 million in one of the first privatization deals in the region since the annexation of the region by Russia.

As of January 2019, Kovalchuk and Nikolai Shamalov through their ownership of Rossiya Bank have become the most important investors in Russia's development of annexed Crimea.

In 2020, the world's leading streaming entertainment service Netflix partnered with Kovalchuk's National Media Group to launch a local-language streaming service in Russia.

On 15 April 2021, Alexei Navalny's website stated that since 2003 Kovalchuk is the owner of Putin's residence at Valdai which is on the southern 100 hectares (250 acres) of a peninsula between Lake Uzhin (Russian: Ужин) and Lake Valdai (Russian: озеро Валдай) in the Novgorod Oblast near Saint Petersburg and is across Lake Valdai from Valday (Russian: Валдай). Often, *Putin's Dacha*, which was built in 1980, is called *Valdai*, *Dolgie Borody*, or *Stalin's Dacha*, but Stalin was not alive when *Valdai* was built. Abutting north of this location is 150 hectares (370 acres) owned by the Russian Federation and is frequented by the Federal Security Service. Kovalchuk leases *Putin's Dacha* to the Russian government for an undisclosed price.

Kovalchuk owns shares in several of Russia’s most influential TV channels, including Channel One Russia. In December 2021, Alisher Usmanov's holding company USM said it had sold its stake in Russia's leading internet group VK to state-run insurance company Sogaz, which is partly owned by Yury Kovalchuk.


## Sanctions

Kovalchuk was one of several individuals sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department on 20 March 2014 in response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. According to the U.S. Treasury, Kovalchuk is a close advisor to President Putin and has been referred to as one of his "cashiers".

Kovalchuk was sanctioned by the UK government in 2014 in relation to Russo-Ukrainian War.
