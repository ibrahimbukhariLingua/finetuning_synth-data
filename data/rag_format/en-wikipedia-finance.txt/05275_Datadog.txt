# Datadog



**Datadog, Inc.** is an American company that provides an observability service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. Founded and headquartered in New York City, the company is a publicly traded entity on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The mascot is a dog named Bits.


## History


### Founding years

Datadog was founded in New York City in 2010 by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc, who met while working at Wireless Generation. After Wireless Generation was acquired by NewsCorp, the two set out to create a product that would reduce the friction they experienced between developer and systems administration teams, who were often working at cross-purposes.

They built Datadog to be a cloud infrastructure monitoring service, with dashboards, alerting, and visualizations of metrics. As cloud adoption increased, Datadog grew rapidly and expanded its product offerings to cover service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware, and OpenStack.


### Company growth

In 2015, Datadog opened a research and development office in Paris.

In 2016, Datadog moved its New York City headquarters to a full floor of the New York Times Building to support its growing team, which doubled over the course of the year. Datadog announced the beta-release of Application Performance Monitoring in 2016, offering for the first time a full-stack monitoring solution. As of 2024, the company has more than 5,200 employees, the majority of which are located in the US, with offices in New York, Boston, Paris, Dublin, Denver, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Japan, Australia and Singapore.

Prior to Datadog's initial public offering (IPO) in September 2019, the company was offered over $7 billion to be acquired by Cisco, but rejected it in favor of going public.

In 2014, Datadog support was broadened to multiple cloud service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Red Hat OpenShift. As of October 2024, the company supports over 750 integrations.
