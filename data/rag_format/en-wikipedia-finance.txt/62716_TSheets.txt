## History

Based in Eagle, Idaho, TSheets was co-founded in 2006 by CEO Matt Rissell, and CTO Brandon Zehm. In 2008, TSheets released a native employee time tracking app for the iPhone. In 2012, TSheets released an integration with accounting and payroll software QuickBooks. In 2015, TSheets accepted $15 million in growth equity funding from Summit Partners, bought a building in Eagle, Idaho, and opened a second location in Sydney, Australia.

On 5 December 2017, Intuit announced an agreement to acquire TSheets. The transaction was valued at approximately $340 million of cash and other consideration and closed on 11 January 2018. After the transaction closed, Time Capture became a new business unit within Intuit's Small Business and Self-Employed Group, with Matt Rissell assuming the leader role reporting to Alex Chriss. TSheets's Eagle, Idaho site became an Intuit location.

On May 4, 2023, Matt Rissell committed suicide by a gunshot wound to the head at his home in Eagle, Idaho. It was reported that someone else was seriously injured during the incident. The person was his wife, who survived.
