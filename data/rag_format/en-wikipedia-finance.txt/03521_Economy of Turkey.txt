The **economy of Turkey** is an emerging free-market economy. It ranked as the 17th-largest in the world and 7th-largest in Europe by nominal GDP in 2024. It also ranked as the 12th-largest in the world and 5th-largest in Europe by PPP in 2024. Turkey's rapid economic growth since the 2000s was stranded by the economic crisis in 2018, but it began to recover in 2021. Turkey's USD-based nominal GDP per capita and GDP-PPP per capita have eventually reached their all-time peak values in 2024. The country is expected to become a high-income economy in a few years.

Turkey is a founding member of the OECD and G20. Ratified in 1995, the European Union–Turkey Customs Union has established a free trade area between Turkey and the European Union, which has increased bilateral foreign trade, investment and economic activity.

As the fifth most visited destination in the world, Turkey has a large tourism industry, which accounted for 12% of the country's total GDP in 2023. First established in 2000, many technoparks were pioneered by Turkish universities, now hosting over 1,600 R&D centers that drew investment by both domestic and international corporations. Turkey is also among the world's leading producers of motor vehicles, consumer electronics, home appliances and defense products. In 2021, the country was ranked eighth in the world in the technology rankings of the Economic Complexity Index.

In the first quarter of the 21st century, there have been major developments in the financial and social aspects of Turkey's economy, such as increases in employment and average income since 2000. A period of strong economic growth between 2002 and 2013 (except for 2009) was followed by a period of stagnation and recession in terms of USD-based nominal GDP figures between 2014 and 2020, especially during the 2018 Turkish currency and debt crisis; even though Turkey's USD-based GDP-PPP and TL-based nominal GDP have continued to grow in this period. Since 2021, there has been a steady recovery and rapid growth in Turkey's USD-based nominal GDP and GDP-PPP figures, which have reached their all-time highest values in both 2023 and 2024.

Growth-focused and populistic financial policies, such as the preference to keep interest rates as low as possible (dubbed *Erdoganomics*) have led to high inflation between 2018 and 2022. Following the Turkish parliamentary and presidential elections on May 14 and 28, 2023, and the appointment of Mehmet Şimşek as the Minister of Treasury and Finance on June 4, 2023, Turkey has adopted a more orthodox monetary policy regarding interest rates and has succeeded in gradually decreasing inflation in 2023 and 2024.

## External trade and investment

As of 2016, the main trading partners of Turkey are the European Union, Russia, the United Kingdom, the UAE, Iraq, and China, many being top in both export as well as import. Turkey has taken advantage of a customs union with the EU, signed in 1995, to increase industrial production for exports, while benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country. In addition to the European-Turkish Customs Union, the Turkish government has signed free-trade agreements with 22 countries.

A very large aspect of Turkey trade revolves around the automotive industry, where its top exports are cars, accounting for $13.2 billion. Other top exports from the country are gold, delivery trucks, vehicle parts and jewelry, which are respectively, $6.96 billion, $5.04 billion, $4.64 billion, and $3.39 billion. These values are calculated using the 1992 revision of the Harmonized System classification. Comparatively, it imports many of the same industries, such as, gold valued at $17.1 billion, refined petroleum at $9.8 billion, cars at $8.78 billion, vehicle parts at $6.34 billion and scrap iron at $5.84 billion.

The construction and contracting companies, such as Enka, Rönesans Holding and Tekfen, have been significant players in the country's economy.

Without a carbon price exporters to the European Union will have to pay the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism from 2026, and in 2024 they started hedging against this by buying EU Allowances.

Turkey had many improvements in the ease of doing business index. Its rank increased from 68th in 2017 to 33rd in 2020. As of 2021, it was performing better than countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.ᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ

## Natural resources


### Energy


#### Renewable energy


#### Fossil fuels


##### Gas


##### Oil


##### Coal


### Minerals

In 2019, the country was the world's 2nd largest producer of chromium; the largest producer of boron; 6th largest producer of antimony; 9th largest producer of lead; 13th largest producer of iron ore; 11th largest producer of molybdenum; 4th largest producer of gypsum; 15th largest producer of graphite; in addition to being the 11th largest producer of salt.

As a gold producer Turkey is currently ranked 22nd globally. Hosting some of the largest gold deposits in the European continent it is currently Europe's largest gold producer, producing 42 tonnes of gold in 2020. World class deposits include Kisladag Mine 17Moz and Copler 10Moz.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Environment

Almost all post-covid stimulus was detrimental to the environment, with Russia being the only worse country. In the 21st century, Turkey's fossil fuel subsidies are around 0.2% of GDP, including at least US$14 billion (US$169 per person) between January 2020 and September 2021. Data on finance for fossil fuels by state-owned banks and export credit agencies is not public.
As of 2023 fossil gas is subsidized more than electricity - equalizing the subsidies would benefit the environment.


## Employment

The minimum wage in Turkey is ₺ 22,104 (US$ 630.36) as of January 1, 2025.

TurkStat estimated unemployment at 9.4% in 2023. The province with the highest unemployment rate was Hakkari at 23.3% and the province with the lowest unemployment rate was Sinop at 4.8%.

In 2021 trade unions complained that according to TurkStat data the unemployment rate was falling, whereas the data provided by the government's Employment Agency (İŞKUR) showed that it was rising.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ? Environmentalists argue that some actions to improve the environment would also benefit the economy. For example, investing in wind power in Turkey and solar power in Turkey would create jobs and is competitive with fossil fuels.


## Poverty

Turkey made steady progress in reducing poverty from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s.ᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ In 2022, social security expenditure stood at 12.4% of GDP according to OECD data.


## Regional disparities

According to Eurostat data, Turkish GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing power standards stood at 64 percent of the EU average in 2018. Istanbul has the largest GDP, while Kocaeli comes first in GDP per capita.

The country's wealth is mainly concentrated in the northwest and west, while the east and southeast suffer from poverty, lower economic production and higher levels of unemployment. However, in line with the rapid growth of Turkey's GDP during the first two decades of the 21st century (with brief periods of stagnation and recession), parts of Anatolia began reaching a higher economic standard. These cities are known as the Anatolian Tigers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
