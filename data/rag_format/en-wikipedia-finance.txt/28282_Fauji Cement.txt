## History

Fauji Cement Company Limited was founded as a publicly traded corporation and initiated operations in 1996. It started with a daily production capacity of 3700 tons, which has since expanded to 11000 tons per day.

In May 2016, one of FCCL's facilities experienced significant damage, which was projected to result in a loss of billions of rupees for the company.

In 2022, FCCL commissioned on two expansion projects, propelling the company to become the second-largest cement producer in the North region and the third-largest in Pakistan. The company broadened its operations at the Nizampur site in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the DG Khan site in Punjab. The Nizampur expansion, which added 2.05 million tons, was operational in the 4th quarter of 2022. The total cost of the project was Rs27 billion, with Rs17 billion financed through debt and Rs10 billion through equity. The DG Khan expansion, also adding 2.05 million tons, is anticipated to be operational in the 3rd quarter of 2024.

On October 27, 2022, FCCL effectively brought into operation the 3rd line of cement production, boasting a daily clinker production capacity of 6,500 tons, at its existing Nizampur site in Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In November 2021, Fauji Cement Company Limited (FCCL) underwent a merger with Askari Cement, a subsidiary of the Army Welfare Trust. The FCCL Board of Directors gave their approval for the integration of Askari Cement Ltd. into its operations through a scheme of arrangement. The consolidation occurred based on a share swap ratio of 5:1, implying that for every 1 share held in Askari Cement Limited, 5 shares of Fauji Cement Company Limited were issued.
