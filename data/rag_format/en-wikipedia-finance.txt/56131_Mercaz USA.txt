## History

Mercaz USA was founded in 1978 and incorporated in Washington, D.C., on June 4, 1979.

In 1998, the Israel Policy Forum asked American Jewish groups to sign a letter encouraging President Bill Clinton to continue his current policy toward the State of Israel and the Palestinian National Authority. Mercaz USA chose not to endorse the letter, saying, "It is not a reflection of the contents of the letter one way or another. It was not a letter coming out of the American Zionist Movement or the Presidents Conference, the two organizations to which Mercaz belongs."

In 1999, the Knesset passed legislature stating that individuals may sit on local religious councils only if they vow allegiance to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. In a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mercaz USA wrote that the legislature was a "deliberate slap in the face of the majority of world Jewry who are not affiliated with Orthodoxy. ... We are deeply concerned that Israel's image as a democratic country may be undermined by this bill."
