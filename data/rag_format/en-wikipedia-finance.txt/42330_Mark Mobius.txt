## Career

Mobius worked at international securities firm Vickers-da-Costa, and later was president of International Investment Trust Company in Taipei, Taiwan. He once ran an independent consulting company that marketed, among other things, Snoopy cartoon merchandise.

Mobius joined Franklin Templeton in 1987 after being asked by John Templeton to run the Templeton Emerging Markets Group. At Franklin Templeton he established and directed the research team based in 18 global emerging markets offices and managed more than $50 billion in emerging markets portfolios.

In 2015, after leading the company for over a quarter of a century, Mark Mobius decided to step down as the lead manager of the Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (TEMIT) and handed over control of the fund to Carlos Hardenberg.

In 2018, Franklin Templeton announced Mobius' retirement from Franklin Templeton effective January 31, 2018.

In March 2018, Mobius launched Mobius Capital Partners together with his former Templeton colleagues Carlos von Hardenberg and Greg Konieczny. The emerging and frontier markets asset manager is focused on a single long-only strategy based on actively partnering with portfolio companies to improve their corporate governance and to deliver a clear ESG pathway.


## Personal life

Born a U.S. citizen, Mobius was also entitled to German citizenship by descent. He renounced his U.S. citizenship and is now a German citizen.

Mobius has stated his preference for a Donald Trump victory in the 2020 United States Presidential election and called a potential win by the Biden-Harris ticket "disastrous" for the stock market and economy.

On March 2, 2023, Mobius told Fox Business in an interview that he cannot take his money out of China due to the country's capital controls. He also said that he would be "very, very careful" investing in the country. According to South China Morning Post, Mobius had sold a flat in Shanghai 18 years ago and deposited the money at a Shanghai branch of HSBC. When he tried to transfer 3 million yuan ($432,270) to a HSBC Hong Kong account, he was asked to submit a lot of documents related to the sale and taxation records which delayed the process. On March 7, according to Bloomberg News, Mobius told Ming Pao that the issue "seems to have resolved". However Mobius has still remained critical of capital controls in China stating that removing capital outflow restrictions would benefit China's economy.
