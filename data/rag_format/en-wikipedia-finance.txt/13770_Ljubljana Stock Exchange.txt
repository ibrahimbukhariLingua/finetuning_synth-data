## History

The existing Ljubljana Stock Exchange was established in 1989. However, brokerage in Slovenia has a much longer tradition: the first stock exchange in Ljubljana existed as early as in the period between 1924 and 1942. Unfortunately, during the Second World War the trading on the old exchange was suspended, and after the war also officially banned by a decree by the new communist regime which replaced monarchy in Yugoslavia. Slovenians were thus left without a stock exchange for almost half a century. Then in the 1989 the Ljubljana Stock Exchange was officially established. In the year 1993 LJSE introduced electronic trading on BTS - on complex Stock Exchange Information System three times a week, floor trading still remained on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The new system of electronic information dissemination - SEOnet was launched in year 2002. Three years later LJSE introduced the elite segment of the official market, listing Slovenia's prime companies, and named it Prime Market.

In the middle of the year 2008 the first regional road-show of SE Europe, organized by all 8 exchanges from the region, was held in Zagreb.

In 2008, the Wiener Börse (Vienna Stock Exchange) bought an 81% stake in the exchange. In 2010, ATVP, the Slovene market regulator restricted the Wiener Börse's voting rights. The rights would be restored only by either purchasing full ownership or no more than 25% stake. The case was taken to the Slovene Supreme Court which upheld the ATVP ruling. The Wiener Börse bought the remaining shares.

In 2009, the CEE Stock Exchange Group (CEESEG) was established including the Wiener Börse and the stock exchanges of Budapest, Ljubljana and Prague.

In the year 2010 there were three major events. The SBITOP Index as the first genuine LJSE blue-chip index became a benchmark index. The exchange launched INFO HRAMBA - the new information system for the central storage of regulated information of all issuers on the LJSE. The exchange published the Slovene Capital Market Development Strategy. This document prepared in cooperation with the capital market participants addressed changing economic and financial circumstances. This strategy proposed the introduction of 'P accounts' in the third pension pillar. The exchange started trading on the international trading system Xetra allowing it to be integrated into an international capital market.

In July 2015, the Wiener Börse sold the Ljubljana Stock Exchange to the Zagreb Stock Exchange (*Zagrebačka burza*).

On 22 February 2016, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, along with the Belgrade Stock Exchange, decided to join SEE Link, and EBRD-sponsored regional network for trading securities.
