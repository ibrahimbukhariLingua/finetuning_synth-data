The sustained growth in construction over decades has enabled the Group to progressively develop other activity sectors due to the business opportunities it has encountered and fostered since the 1970s, such as concessions and services (since 1984), real estate (since 1973), hospitality (since 1992), distribution (since 1996), energy (since 1996) and automotive (since 1991). Although in 2016 it still operated in the energy sector – where it had operated since 1996 – Teixeira Duarte divested its stake in the entity through which it maintained its activity in this sector in the first quarter of 2017.

With a consolidated process of internationalisation, Teixeira Duarte has long operated in other markets which are nowadays still important in its operations, such as Venezuela (since 1978), Angola (since 1979), Mozambique (since 1982), Spain (since 2003), Algeria (since 2005) and Brazil (since 2006), currently also added by France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, the United States, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Morocco, South Africa, China, Qatar, Kuwait, Gabão, and Cabo Verde.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
