# Wassim al-Qattan



**Wassim Anwar al-Qattan** (Arabic: وسيم أنور القطان; born March 4, 1976), also known as ***Wassim Qattan***, is a Syrian businessman who held several contracts with the Ba'athist Government of Syria to develop government-owned shopping malls and hotel properties in Damascus, Syria. He was President of the Rif Dimashq Chamber of Commerce. He was reportedly close to Maher al-Assad, the brother of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

In February 2020, the European Union sanctioned al-Qattan for providing material support to the Ba'athist Syrian government. In July 2020, the US Department of Treasury sanctioned Wassim al-Qattan and entities associated with him for "providing material assistance in support of the Government of Syria". The Treasury alleged that al-Qattan had ties to regime figures and held several contracts with the Syrian government to invest in and manage government-owned shopping malls and hotels in Damascus. Al-Qattan's reaction to the US Treasury sanctions was to celebrate on Facebook, describing them as a "third package of medals". He is also sanctioned by the UK Treasury.
