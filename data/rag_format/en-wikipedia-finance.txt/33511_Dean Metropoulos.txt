In 1981, Metropoulos made his first acquisition of Stella Foods Inc., a Vermont-based cheese company, which later sold to Robert Bass for $375 million.

Some of the buy-build private equity transactions of Metropoulos have included Pinnacle Foods, Ghirardelli Chocolate Company, International Home Foods, Pabst Brewing Company, The Morningstar Group, Inc. (sold to Suiza Foods which has become Dean Foods), Solar Marine ("a private, European based, international dry cargo shipping company"), Bumble Bee Foods, Vlasic Pickles, and Mumm's/Perrier-Jouët champagnes.
