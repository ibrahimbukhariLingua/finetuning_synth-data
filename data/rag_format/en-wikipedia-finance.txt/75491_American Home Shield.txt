**American Home Shield** Corporation is an American home warranty company based in Memphis, Tennessee. It administers home warranty contracts on major home systems and appliances.


## Overview

American Home Shield was founded in 1971 and operated independently until it was acquired by ServiceMaster in 1989. In 2018, the American Home Shield business was spun off under Frontdoor, Inc., a new, publicly traded company on the NASDAQ (ticker symbol FTDR). American Home Shield serves over 2 million customers across 49 states and the District of Columbia. It is one of the largest home warranty providers in the United States. The company works with over 16,000 independent contractor firms and 60,000 technicians in the U.S. The headquarters are in Memphis, Tennessee.


## History

In 2019, Frontdoor, Inc. acquired Streem, Inc., which uses enhanced augmented reality, computer vision, and machine learning to help home services professionals diagnose home breakdowns virtually and assess if any parts are needed prior to the initial in-home visit. American Home Shield now uses Streem technology as part of their service process in available markets. Frontdoor launched American Home Shield ProConnect in 2020 to offer on-demand home maintenance services. American Home Shield ProConnect is available in 37 markets.


## Headquarters

The companyâ€™s corporate headquarters is located in the heart of downtown Memphis, Tennessee. In March 2020, American Home Shield transitioned all employees to a virtual work environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In mid-2021, the company announced that it would be virtual-first company. They outsource all of their customer service to other countries.
