Writer's Market


# Writer's Market



***Writer's Market*** (***WM***) is an annual resource book for writers who wish to sell their work and become published authors. The publication is released by *Writer's Digest* and usually hits bookstores around the summertime of each year. *Writer's Market* was first published in 1921 and is often referred to as "The Bible for Writers" or "The Freelancer's Bible."

Writer's Digest's former parent company, F+W Media, was auctioned off as part of bankruptcy proceedings in 2019. Penguin Random House LLC acquired the Writer's Digest Books brand, including Market Books and WritersMarket.com.
