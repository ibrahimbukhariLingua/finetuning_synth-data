# Auckland Savings Bank Building



The **Auckland Savings Bank Building** is a Category I historic building located at 260 Queen Street, Auckland CBD. Built in 1884, the premises were formerly owned by the Auckland Savings Bank. In 1977, the building was acquired by the newly established McDonald's New Zealand and was converted into a fast food restaurant. It was the first McDonald's restaurant in Auckland and only the second in New Zealand (behind Porirua). The restaurant closed in 2020 and relocated two doors down the road. In June 2023 McDonald's listed the building for sale. As of April 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ it remains for sale.


## Architecture

Designed by Edward Bartley, the facade was inspired by Italian Renaissance palazzi, a style much used by commerce and banking during some eras. It is one of the few remaining buildings on Queen Street that is over a hundred years old. Much of the facade and interior design have been renovated and preserved.
