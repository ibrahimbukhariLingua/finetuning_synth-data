# National Association of Enrolled Agents



The **National Association of Enrolled Agents** (**NAEA**) is an organization of enrolled agents (EAs) in the United States. Founded in 1972, it claims a membership of 11,000 EAs.

While its mission statement presents itself publicly as an advocate of taxpayer rights, its primary functions are educating tax professionals in best practices for representing taxpayers to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), protecting the interests of the profession, and expanding the role of enrolled agents in both the public and private sectors.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
