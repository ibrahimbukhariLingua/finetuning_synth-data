Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions of its Hotel Manager product, which hoteliers use to market their facilities on the Trivago site. Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Since their majority shareholder is Expedia, the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites' rates are perceived.

## Marketing

### The "Trivago guy"

When the company aired its first U.S. TV advertisement in 2012, the ad's spokesman inspired a trending Twitter hashtag, #trivagoguy, based on his unusual look.
According to *Rolling Stone*, Trivago "wanted someone real, approachable and genuine" when it chose actor Tim Williams to star in the ad. The Trivago guy became an unexpected celebrity, with some people noting his unbuttoned shirt and creepy vibe, while others found his scruffy appearance and deep voice "inexplicably sexy".

Trivago responded to the comments by launching a contest that invited people to give the Trivago guy a makeover. The Trivago guy inspired parodies, fan fiction and a large gay following.

Many commenters asked why Trivago chose not to have the actor wear a belt. According to the actor, that was an accident. "Unfortunately none of the belts fit the belt loops that I had on," Williams said. "I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten." Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago guys.
From 2016 until June 2017, the French actor Mehdi Nebbou was the German Trivago guy.

For Latin America (the whole Spanish-speaking region) Trivago's commercials are presented by Spanish actor Gonzalo Peña. In Brazil, the man shown on screen is the well-known actor and model Willian Mello.

In 2016, the company aired ads in India with Abhinav Kumar. Abhinav became popular and an internet sensation for his role in ubiquitous Trivago ads in India.
As of now the Trivago guy has turned into an internet meme.


### The "Trivago girl"

In the UK, Trivago's advertisements are fronted by Australian actress and musician Gabrielle Miller.
In Japan, Trivago is represented in their TV commercials by singer/songwriter Natalie Emmons, who uses the pseudonym "Strae" in the United States. In Malaysia, actress and TV host Dahlia Shazwan has starred in Trivago's advertisements.


## Legal issues

In August 2018, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged in a court case brought against Trivago in the Federal Court of Australia that the company had misled consumers on their website and in their television advertising. The court found that search results were ordered giving preference to the highest paying "cost per click" advertisers, rather than outright cheapest prices. It was also found that the company's television advertising misled consumers by purporting to be "impartial and objective", when it fact it wasn't. The ACCC case started in the Federal Court of Australia in September 2019. In January 2020, the court found that Trivago breached Australian consumer law by misleading consumers on which hotel deals were best and made false representations to consumers. The ACCC argued Trivago promised customers impartial, objective and transparent hotel price comparisons which would allow them to quickly and easily identify the cheapest offer available. Instead, Trivago promoted its best advertisers, the ACCC claimed. The ACCC claimed Trivago failed to properly disclose its operating model and used misleading "strike-through" price comparisons that compared a more expensive luxury room with a standard room.

In April 2022, the Federal Court fined Trivago AUD44.7 million, plus legal costs for misleading consumers. The ACCC had pushed for a fine of AUD90 million. Justice Moshinsky of the Federal Court noted Trivago's breaches of the law were "extremely serious".
