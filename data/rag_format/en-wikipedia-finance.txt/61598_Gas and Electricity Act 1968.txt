Gas and Electricity Act 1968


# Gas and Electricity Act 1968



The **Gas and Electricity Act 1968** (c. 39) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which extended the powers of the Gas Council, the area gas boards and the Electricity Council to borrow money, including foreign currency, to meet their obligations; it permitted statutory gas and electricity bodies to render technical aid overseas; and allowed further member appointments to the Electricity Council. The Act was principally in response to a rapid growth of the gas industry following the discovery of North Sea gas on the UK Continental Shelf in 1965.


## Background

The government recognised that there had been significant technological development in the gas industry since the first natural gas was discovered in the UK sector of the North Sea in 1965. This included major capital investments in onshore terminals and cross-country pipelines. It was envisaged that sales of gas would double by 1970/71 and double again by 1973. Both the gas and electricity industries had expressed an interest in borrowing capital in foreign currency markets. The expanded functions of the Gas Council had made it desirable for the council membership to be increased. The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 addressed these issues and provided the necessary legal powers.

The **Gas and Electricity Act 1968** received royal assent on 3 July 1968. Its long title is: ‘An Act to increase the statutory limits on the amounts outstanding in respect to borrowings by the Gas Council and Area Gas Boards; to provide for the borrowing by the Electricity Council, the Scottish Electricity Boards and the Gas Council of money in foreign currency; to enable the said Councils and Boards and other electricity authorities to furnish overseas aid; to increase the number of members of the Gas Council; and for connected purposes.’
