## Franchise system

In February 2004, Sotheby’s entered into a long-term strategic alliance with real estate services provider Realogy Holdings Corp., now Anywhere Real Estate, Inc. The agreement provided for the licensing of the *Sotheby’s International Realty* name and the development of a full franchise system. Franchises in the system are granted to brokerages and individuals meeting Realogy's qualifications. The franchisor supports its agents with operational, marketing, recruiting, educational, and business development resources.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
