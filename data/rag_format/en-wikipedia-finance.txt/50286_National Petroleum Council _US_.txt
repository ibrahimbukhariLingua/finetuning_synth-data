National Petroleum Council (US)


# National Petroleum Council (US)



The **National Petroleum Council** (**NPC**) is an American advisory committee representing oil and natural gas industry views to the United States Secretary of Energy.


## History

The council was established in 1946 at the request of President Harry S. Truman to represent industry views on any matters relating to oil and natural gas. In 1977, its role was transferred to the new Department of Energy, and the council is now formally chartered as Federal Advisory Committee with private funding.


## Committee

The NPC currently has 203 members, organized and appointed by the Secretary of Energy. Individual members serve without compensation as representatives of their industry as a whole, not as lobbyists for specific companies. The committee is organized to reflect the geographic extent of the oil and gas industry while also covering all industry sectors and representing both large and small companies.
