## History

The first Norwegian assurance associations for ships were first established in 1806. In 1837, Langesundfjordens Skibs Assuranceforening (later called Den FÃ¸rste Norske Assuranceforening) and Skibsassurance-foreningen in Arendal were founded.

In the mid nineteenth century, the fleet of steamships in Norway expanded rapidly and the fastest growth was seen in Bergen. To cover the increasing need of insurance for locally owned steamships, Bergen Dampskibs-Assuranceforening was founded in 1879. Meanwhile, insurance clubs also appeared in other parts of the country. Within a short time, Skibsassuranceforeningen Vidar (est. 1895) became a central actor in the insurance market on the east coast of Norway.

Bergens Assuranceforening and Bergens Dampskibs-Assuranceforening merged in 1937 to form Bergen Hull Club. In 1951, UNITAS was formed through a merger of several clubs on the east coast of Norway led by Skibsassuranceforeningen Vidar. In the following years, UNITAS merged with the remaining clubs on the east and south coasts of Norway and became lead underwriter for nearly 900 vessels.1

In January 2001, Bergen Hull Club and UNITAS merged to establish Norwegian Hull Club.
