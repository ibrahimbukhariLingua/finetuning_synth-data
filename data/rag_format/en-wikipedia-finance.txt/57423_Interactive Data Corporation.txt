## History


### Timesharing services

Founded in 1968 as a Waltham, Massachusetts-based time-sharing company, *Interactive Data Corporation* was acquired by Chase Manhattan Bank in 1974.

Like competitor National CSS (NCSS), their time-sharing service was based on IBM's CP/CMS Time-sharing software for the IBM System 360 Model 67. IDC focused on the financial industry, while NCSS had a broader client base.

In 1984, Chase expanded IDC by purchasing Western Union's *Telstat Systems* division.


### Data services

In 2002 Interactive bought Merrill Lynch's securities pricing service.

Interactive Data became known as a supplier of financial market data and related offerings, "including data bases used for economic forecasting." Acquisitions have contributed to Interactive Data's growth, enabling the company to deliver an increasing range of services, while expanding into adjacent markets and extending its reach geographically.

Later on, Pearson PLC owned 61% of the company. In 2010 the company announced the completion of its acquisition by two private equity firms, Warburg Pincus and Silver Lake Partners.

In 2015, Intercontinental Exchange announced the acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation from Warburg Pincus and Silver Lake Partners.
