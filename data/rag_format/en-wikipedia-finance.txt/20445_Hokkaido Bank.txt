## History

The Hokkaido Bank was established on March 5, 1951 in Sapporo. In 1997, Hokkaido Bank entered into merger talks with the embattled Hokkaido Takushoku Bank. However, these talks broke off and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank subsequently entered bankruptcy. On May 24, 2002, Hokkaido Bank and Hokuriku Bank agreed to business tie-ups. Approximately one year later on May 23, 2003, the banks agreed to merge management. On September 1, 2004, both banks became subsidiaries of the Hokuhoku Financial Group.
