Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations


# Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations



The **Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations** (**SCVO**) is the national membership body for Scotland’s charities, voluntary organisations and social enterprises. SCVO works to support people to take voluntary action to help themselves and others, and to bring about social change. It provides services and support to the third sector in Scotland to advance shared values and interests. SCVO has approximately 2,800 members, ranging from individuals and grassroots groups, to Scotland-wide organisations and intermediary bodies. The organisation employs approximately 100 staff.


## Aims

SCVO’s aims are to:

* support third sector organisations to do their work
* promote and support shared interests of third sector organisations
* connect people with ways to get involved with their communities
* as an organisation continually learn, develop and enhance its own effectiveness.

## Governance

SCVO is governed by a Management Board with representatives elected from its Policy Committee. Anna Fowlie has been Chief Executive since 23 April 2018, taking over from Martin Sime who held the role from 1991 to late 2017. Andrew Burns is the current convener.


## History

The organisation was established on 1 October 1943 as the **Scottish Council of Social Service** (**SCSS**). During its first years much of the Council’s work was dictated by wartime need and its immediate aftermath.

In 1983 the Council’s name was changed to the **Scottish Council for Community and Voluntary Organisations** with the working title of **Voluntary Action for Scotland**. In 1986 the name Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations was adopted.

In 2003, the SCVO moved its headquarters to the newly restored and repurposed Mansfield Place Church in Edinburgh.

SCVO hosted the 6th, 7th and 8th CIVICUS World Assemblies in 2006, 2007 and 2008.


## Current work

SCVO supports the third sector in Scotland in a variety of ways, including

* Lobbying and campaigning on behalf of the sector
* Running training, conferences and events
* Providing services and deals to members
* Managing jobs and employability initiatives
