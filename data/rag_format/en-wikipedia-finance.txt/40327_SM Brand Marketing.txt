## History

On August 19, 2008, SM Entertainment announced that it would establish SM Brand Marketing, adding it to its affiliates. The company is in charge of brand planning and marketing consulting, such as planning, branding, and marketing on lifestyle businesses encompassing the restaurant industry, fashion, and food and beverage industries. Sum, a celebrity shop run by the company, is where items related to the artists are sold and is located on the second floor of closed SM Town Coex Artium. The shop offers merchandise products commercializing the company's artists. SMBM also operates its global e-commerce platform SM Town &Store and retail shop SM Town &Store@DDP.

On February 23, 2022, SMBM signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Binance to launch a global Play-to-Create (P2C) ecosystem. In the future, SMBM plans to establish diverse environments wherein creators worldwide can participate in IP-based re-creation and earn profits transparently, including affiliated royalties. SMBM and Binance will push for joint work to create a blockchain mainnet, NFT, and eco-fund. The company also partnered with The Sandbox for its metaverse platform, P2C ecosystem, and SM Town Land, a themed space created in K-verse, an area for K-content in The Sandbox. SMBM and The Sandbox will plan and create NFT products using their IP, production know-how, and technology and jointly operate a fan-participating service.
