Investment Coordinating Board


# Investment Coordinating Board



The **Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board** (Indonesian: *Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal*, BKPM) was until 2021 a Non-Ministerial Government Body in Indonesia for formulation of government policies in the field of investment, both domestically and abroad. Since 2021, it was elevated into a ministry, the Ministry of Investment.


## History

ICB was established in 1973, replacing the function carried out by the Investment Technical Committee (Indonesian: *Panitia Teknis Penanaman Modal*) which was formed previously in 1968. In 1982, ICB absorbed Ministry of Development for Domestic Product (Indonesian: *Kementerian Peningkatan Penggunaan Produksi Dalam Negeri*). In 1988, ICB transformed into State Ministry of Investment (Indonesian: *Kementerian Menteri Negara Penanaman Modal*). In 1998, ICB/State Ministry of Investment was merged into Ministry of State Owned Enterprises. The merging decision was reverted in 2001.

With the enactment of the Law on Investment in 2007, ICB became a Government agency that is the coordinator of investment policy, both among government agencies, the government and Bank Indonesia, as well as the government with regional governments as well as regional governments with regional governments. ICB is also mandated as an advocacy body for investors.

It was speculated that the new ministry either split off from part of Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs or elevation of existing Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board. However, it later confirmed that the ministry actually elevation of Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board. If done, this ministry is continuation of previously Suharto era and early Reformasi era's Habibie State Ministry of the Promotion of Investment, which existed during 1993 to 1999, during Sixth Development Cabinet and Development Reform Cabinet, respectively.
