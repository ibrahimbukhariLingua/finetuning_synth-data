# Summit Partners



**Summit Partners** is an American investment firm based in Boston, Massachusetts. The firm focuses on investing in technology, healthcare, life sciences and other growth industries.


## Background

Summit Partners was founded in 1984 by Roe Stamps and Stephen Woodsum, who previously worked together at TA Associates. Greg Avis would also join as a co-founder shortly after. The firm is considered one of the earliest private equity firms to focus on growth investing.

In 2000, the three co-founders handed over daily management of the firm to five partners.

In 2015, the firm acquired Alydar Capital. It now operates as the public equity investment arm of Summit Partners.

In January 2024, it was reported that Summit Partners' credit arm ceased making new investments after it struggled with its latest fundraising due to poor performance of its credit funds. The credit business is seen as an awkward fit for Summit Partner which focuses on growth equity and the firm had previously tried to sell credit business in the previous year.

Summit Partners is headquartered in Boston with additional offices in Menlo Park, London and Luxembourg.
