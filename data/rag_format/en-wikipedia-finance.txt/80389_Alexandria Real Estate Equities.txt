## History

In 1993, one of the partners of Jacobs Engineering Group, Jerry M. Sudarsky, was presented with a Business Plan written by Kendell R. Lang titled BioProperties Management Group, Inc., which was a plan to form a REIT dedicated to funding biotech properties. The initial business plan included founders Kendell Lang, Alan Gold, Gary Kreitzer, and Steven Stone as part of the initial management team. Jacobs approached Joel S. Marcus, a lawyer and CPA, with the idea of representing their interests in this company to oversee the management team who intended to provide laboratories and office space to biotech firms. Jacobs invested in the company with $5 million.

Its first purchase was of 4 buildings in San Diego which had been negotiated and structured by Kendell R. Lang.

In 1997, it became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $155 million.

In October 2002, the company acquired the headquarters of ZymoGenetics for $52 million in a leaseback transaction.

In 2007, the company began the development of the West Tower of the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto. The company stopped construction during the Great Recession, and in 2014, it sold its interest to the Government of Ontario for $65 million.

In January 2013, the company sold a research facility in Seattle to Trammell Crow Company for $42.6 million.

In June 2018, the company acquired an office building leased to Amazon.com in Seattle from The Blackstone Group for $95 million.

In July 2018, the company acquired 219 East 42nd Street, the headquarters of Pfizer, for $203 million in a leaseback transaction. Beginning in 2023, Pfizer made plans to move their headquarters across town to The Spiral at Hudson Yards.
