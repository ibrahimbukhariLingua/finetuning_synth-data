## History

Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton Airports were originally owned and operated by the British Airports Authority, which acquired them in the 1970s. In the late 1980s the authority was sold off by the government and became BAA plc.

By 2012 BAA had sold off three of their seven airports and rebranded as Heathrow Airport Holdings (HAH). In 2014 HAH decided to sell off Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton to enable the company to focus on improving Heathrow for passengers and winning support for Heathrow expansion.

Meanwhile, AGS Airports was formed by Ferrovial, a Spanish firm specializing in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport, urban and services infrastructure, and Macquarie Group, an Australian company consisting of diversified financial services. In December 2014, three months after being incorporated, AGS acquired Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton Airports from HAH.

In January 2023, AGS Airport's appointed Andy Cliffe at Chief Executive Office taking over from Derek Provan. In November 2024, it was announced that AGS would be acquired for £1.53 billion by AviAlliance, one of the world's leading private airport operators and investors.

In January 2025, the firm had its purchase completed. AviAlliance is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSP Investments, one of Canada’s largest pension investors, which is a long-standing investor in UK infrastructure with majority stakes in the port operator Forth Ports, one of the UK’s largest port groups and Angel Trains, the largest rolling stock company in the UK.
