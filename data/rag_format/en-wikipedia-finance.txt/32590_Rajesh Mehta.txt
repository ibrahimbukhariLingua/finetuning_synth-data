## Early life

Rajesh Mehta was born on 20 June 1964 in Bengaluru, to Jasvantrai Mehta and Chandrika Ben Mehta. He was brought up in Bangalore in a lower-middle-class Jain family, the third of his three brothers– Bipin, Prashant, and Mahesh. His father migrated from Morbi (Gujarat) to Bangalore in 1946 and worked at a private firm. Later, he quit the job and started a small business of trading semi-precious stones in Gujarat under the name of ‘Rajesh Diamond Company’.


## Career

He went to St. Joseph’s School and studied at National College for two years. He aspired to be a doctor but chose his father’s jewellery business instead. He and his brother Prashant took over the family business. He approached Bipin, the eldest brother, who worked at a bank, for a loan of Rs 1,200 and started a silver trading business. He bought jewellery from Chennai and sold it back at Rajkot to their relatives at a profit. He gradually started selling jewellery to retailers and wholesalers based in Gujarat. They later started buying silver jewellery from Gujarat and sold it to retailers and wholesalers at Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Through this way he popularized multiple ethnic Indian jewellery designs and cultures in different states of India. He formed an entity called ‘Rajesh Art Jewellers’ and started bartering goods. The company’s capital base increased by 50% with every barter cycle.
The silver jewellery business was successful, and Mehta moved into gold jewellery in 1989, setting up a 10-worker manufacturing unit in his garage at Bangalore. This company was named ‘Rajesh Exports’. It exported gold to United Kingdom, Dubai, Oman, Kuwait, the US, and Europe, and made a business of INR 20 million by the year 1992. The export business eventually grew to INR 1.2 billion by 1998.
Mehta then opened a standalone retail store, which is now called ‘Shubh Jewellers’. There are 81 Shubh stores in Karnataka.
