### Winter break

Not only was there a large amount of movement on the transfer market during the summer, but also during the winter break transfer window.

After only six months with the club Jordi Quintillà left the squad and returned to his previous club St. Gallen. Gonçalo Cardoso's loan period from West Ham came to an end.

## The Campaign


### Domestic League

The 2021–22 Swiss Super League season started on the weekend of 24 to 25 July 2021 and will end on 21 May 2022. Basel's first game was an away game against the newly promoted Grasshopper Club and this was won 2–0, the goals coming as an own goal from Leonardo Campana and the second from Sebastiano Esposito. In the second matchday Basel faced Sion at home and won 6–1, with six different goal scorers, Pajtim Kasami, Sergio López, Eray Cömert, Sebastiano Esposito, Arthur Cabral and Edon Zhegrova. The third matchday gave Basel another home game against Servette. This was won 5–1. Cabral scored four of these and Esposito the other.


### Domestic Cup

Basel also participated in 2021–22 Swiss Cup and they started in the first round which took place on the week-end 14/15 August 2021, the final will take place on 5 May 2022. Basel's aim for this competition was to win it. In the first round, teams from the Super League and Challenge League were seeded and could not play against each other. In a match, the home advantage was granted to the team from the lower league, if applicable. Basel were drawn against FC Schönenwerd-Niedergösgen.

Basel's first opponents were the fifth tier team FC Schönenwerd-Niedergösgen. The game was played at Sportplatz Inseli, in Niedergösgen and the attendance was 2,254 fans, which meant that the Sportpaltz was sold out. As head coach Patrick Rahmen had announced in advance, he made changes in the starting line-up for the cup game. Thus Đorđe Nikolić, Gonçalo Cardoso, Adrian Durrer and Tician Tushi came to their first appearances this season. Also Kaly Sene and Liam Millar were in the starting line-up for the very first time. Taulant Xhaka led the team as captain. In the first few minutes, the amateurs made it clear that they were not willing to distribute gifts and they quickly put the player leading the ball under pressure. However, the visitors soon took dictation of the game and were twice unlucky as a shot bounced back from the goal post shots during the first quarter of an hour. In the 20th minute the ball landed in the goal for the first time and by the end the result was clear. There were six different goal scorers as Basel won 7–0, Tician Tushi scored twice and the players Raoul Petretta, Matías Palacios, Darian Males and Kaly Sene each scored once, the other goal was an own goal.

In the second round Basel were again drawn away from home against another fifth tier team, this time FC Rorschach-Goldach. The game was played on 19 September, the goal scorers here were Liam Millar, Taulant Xhaka and Matías Palacios and Basel won 3–0 to advance to the next round.

In the third round Basel were drawn against third tier Étoile Carouge. The game was played on 27 October in the Stade de la Fontenette. The team from the Promotion League played a game on par with FCB and earned their qualification for the quarter-finals. Romain Kursner scored the only goal of the game shortly after the start of the second half. A brief rallying period by the guests had no consequences and the longer the game lasted, the more often their attacks got stuck in the defense of the home team. And so nothing changed in the result until the final whistle. Basel suffered a 0–1 defeat and were eliminated from the cup.

Basel were eliminated from the cup with this frustrating result and thus did not achieve their aim. It was not only disappointing following last season's quick dismissal by lower-tier team Winterthur, it was also very annoying because other strongly rated teams had also already been eliminated, such as Young Boys, a round earlier, but also Zürich, Servette and Grasshoppers had failed to reach the quarter-finals.


### Europa Conference League

Basel were qualified for the newly created 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League and they started in the second qualifying round. The draw was held on 16 June 2021 and the first leg matches took place on 22 July 2021 and the return leg was played one week later on 29 July. Basel were drawn against the winners of the match between Sfîntul Gheorghe and Partizani, which the Albanien team decided for themselves.


#### Qualifying rounds

The first leg of the second qualifying round tie was held at the St. Jakob-Park in front of an attendance of 6,095 fans. Referee was Dennis Higler of the Royal Dutch Football Association and he reported an excellent pitch on this warm and clear evening. FCB started well, with swing, and put Partizani under pressure. They settled into the opposing half of the pitch for about the first 20 minutes. Subsequently, however, they slackened and the game became more balanced. During a phase in which the Basel team seemed to operate helpless, the first goal fell for the hosts. Arthur Cabral with a good cross and then Darian Males headed the ball into the centre making it easy for Valentin Stocker to score with a header from very close range shortly before the break. The undisputed highlight of the match was Arthur Cabral's 2–0 in the 52nd minute. The Brazilian goal getter picked up a long, diagonal ball from Fabian Frei in the penalty area with his back to the goal. He lifted the ball on his knee and this high enough for him to perform an overhead kick. It was not just an attempt. The ball slammed with force into the goal. On 80 minutes Michael Lang played a cross and Cabral gave the assist as Stocker side footed the ball in to make it three. A few minutes later, Edon Zhegrova had another chance, but his shot rebounded from the post and so 3–0 was the final score.

The second leg was played at the Elbasan Arena in Elbasan with an attendance of 950 fans. The referee was Gergő Bogár of the Hungarian Football Federation and he reported a soft pitch on a clear evening with 35 °C. Basel started well into the game and dominated their opponents Partizani. Up until the opening goal, it had only been FCB that created good chances. Edon Zhegrova hit the post after 17 minutes, from the edge of the penalty area, and a little later the Basel team almost took advantage of a serious defensive error. The superiority of the FCB team was evident over the entire 90 minutes. Shortly before the break, Valentin Stocker scored the opener as he dusted off after an insufficiently cleared shot from Arthur Cabral. Cabral doubled up on 49 minutes. Subsequently, the Basel team did not run into any risk of missing the qualification to the next round. A quarter of an hour before the end, the hosts also had their first good chance at goal, but Stênio Júnior's shot was too weak and it was a safe prey for keeper Heinz Lindner. Partizani had their best chance of achieving a consolation goal in stoppage time, as two men appeared alone in front of Lindner, but they failed to get the ball into the goal and the score remained 2–0 for the visitors.

In the penultimate qualifying round, Basel faced the traditional club Újpest Budapest. The Hungarians had prevailed against Vaduz with a 2–1 in the first leg and with a 3–1 in the Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz. The first leg took place in Szusza Ferenc Stadion in Budapest with an attendance of 2,367 fans. The arbitrator was Jérôme Brisard of the French Football Federation and he reported a damp pitch on this partially cloudy evening. FCB was the better team in terms of play and with the technically stronger players and this remained evident throughout the game. Only, they had a hard time with the physically robust hosts, who quickly switched to offensive play after Basel lost the ball. The mistakes in the Basel midfield led to dangerous chances for Újpest, especially in the starting quarter of an hour. Their first chance on six minutes, Branko Pauljević caught a loose ball, prevailed into the box, but his shot rebounded from the post. On 10 minutes an error by Pajtim Kasami and Újpest's French playmaker Yohan Croizet bent a ball from 20 meters goalwards, but keeper Heinz Lindner pushed the ball over. A bad pass by Matias Palacios was intercepted by Vincent Onovo, a fine long ball allowed Croizet to achieve the hosts goal five minutes before half-time. But Basel managed to turn this 0–1 into a 2–1 despite a performance with many shortcomings. Arthur Cabral scored in the 55th minute with his head to equalize after an opponent had involuntarily passed the ball on to him. And in the 74th minute, the Brazilian delivered the pass to Darian Males who made it 2–1, although he was probably in an offside position.

In the second leg the St. Jakob-Park had an attendance of 12,337 people and referee was Yigal Frid from the Israel Football Association. Coach Patrick Rahmen's team started well into play against their opponents Újpest. Because Edon Zhegrova was injured, Darian Males played on the right wing in the starting formation and he thanked his coach for his nomination with the first goal to the 1–0 lead. This goal he scored from close range with a direct volley after a cross from Sebastiano Esposito. The 2–0 in stoppage time at the end of first half was stuck with the blemish that goal scorer Valentin Stocker had pushed his opponent in the back. The goal would most likely have been cancelled if UEFA had used the VAR in European Cup qualifiers. In the second half, Basel's goalkeeper Heinz Linder had to show a great save against a player who ran unmarked against him. In the 71st minute Esposito fabulously prepared a chance from the left and Arthur Cabral solely had to push the ball home to make it 3–0. Substitute full-back Raoul Petretta ended the scoring with the 4–0 in the 90th minute. Without any effort and with another convincing performance, Basel reached the playoffs in the Conference League.

The draw for the play-offs gave Basel a tie against Hammarby IF. The team from Stockholm were the current Swedish cup winners. The first leg was played in the St. Jakob-Park in front of an attendance of 12,144 fans and referee in charge of the game was Sergey Ivanov of the Russian Football Union. Thanks to two late goals and a total of three strikes from the irrepressible goal getter Arthur Cabral, Basel won the first leg against Hammarby 3–1. Coach Patrick Rahmen's team was nowhere near as irresistible as they had been in all previous home games of the season. Especially in the second half, the Swedes did not have much trouble controlling the match and did not give Basel any scoring chances for the longest of times. Cabral first scored with a header after half an hour. Sebastiano Esposito circled the free kick from the side on to Cabral's head. The Italian teenager, on loan from Inter Milan, was, along with Cabral, the biggest Basel asset - and almost the only asset for a long time in this match. The Swedes equalized through Abdul Khalili after 71 minutes, as the Basel defence failed to clear the ball from the box after a high cross. When there was hardly any indication of further goals, suddenly the Brazilian stricker was successful with a well-placed shot after 86 minutes and then again from a hands penalty after 89 minutes.

The Tele2 Arena in Stockholm with an attendance of 7,855 fans was the location where referee Bobby Madden of the Scottish Football Association blew his whistle for the second leg between Hammarby and Basel. Both teams started slow and spent more than a quarter of an hour watch things pass. In fact, the entire first half was played mostly in the midfield area. The Basler had shown and needed nerves, especially after the break, when they let Hammarby IF catch up on the two-goal deficit of the first leg within six minutes. The Icelandic central defender Jón Fjóluson was first successful with a header in the 48th minute and then he increased to 2–0 on 54 minutes with a long-range shot from around 20 meters that was slightly deflected by Cabral. Basel then caught themselves and took control of the match. In extra time Hammarby, contrary to the course of the game and from an alleged offside position by Aziz Ouattara they took the lead 3–0 in the 101st minute. Basel then showed a strong reaction eight minutes later, substitute Afimico Pululu could only be stopped by his opponent with a foul in the penalty area. This enabled Cabral to score from the spot. In the penalty shootout Cabral took the responsibility, as the last marksman he converted the decisive spot-kick and became match winner for the FCB, who won 4–3 after the penalty shootout.


#### Group stage

The draw for the group stage was held on 27 August 2021. Basel were seeded into pot 1. Basel were drawn into group H together with Qarabağ from Azerbaijan, Kairat from Almaty in Kazakhstan and Omonia from Nicosia in Cyprus.

The club Qarabağ FK originates from Aghdam, but has not played in its hometown since 1993 due to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War. The club is now based in the capital city of Baku. They qualified for the Conference League by being runners-up in their domestic league. The previous season FC Kairat were 2020 Kazakhstan Premier League champions and had been qualified for the Champions League. After being defeated they were relegated to the Europa League and following defeat in the third qualifying round transferred to the Conference League. The same fate from the Champions League/Europa League/Conference League had occurred to AC Omonia after they became 2020–21 Cypriot First Division champions.

After a 7-hour flight over about 4,400 Kilometres, the Basel team and staff arrived in Baku. On matchday 1 of the group stage Qarabağ played hosts to Basel. Qarabağ played this home match at Baku Olympic Stadium, capacity 68,000, instead of their regular stadium Azersun Arena, with has a capacity of 5,800 and which did not meet UEFA requirements. The attendance for this match was 17,586 fans. The referee was Erik Lambrechts from the Royal Belgian Football Association. Both teams started slow into the match and evaluated each other. Basel were unable to dictate play as desired for most of the game, so they rarely had dangerous actions. Raoul Petretta missed the best opportunity shortly before the break. The full-back failed with his shot from an acute angle on Karabach's goalie Shahrudin Mahammadaliyev. The reason why FCB reached a goalless draw was due not only to their clever defensive play, but also due to their opponents’ lushness. Qarabağ combined well, but lacked determination of purpose. Until the final minutes they had made nothing of their superiority except half-chances. Goalie Heinz Lindner was only challenged in the 84th and 94th minute. The Austrian keeper parried twice, first a shot and then a header.

Matchday 2 and Basel were hosts to Kairat. St. Jakob-Park had an attendance of 8,712 fans and referee Stuart Attwell from the FA reported an excellent pitch. Basel started well into the match, dominated their opponents from the beginning and it was no surprise as Arthur Cabral put them into the lead after 15 minutes. A long ball to the far post, Liam Millar headed the ball into the goal mouth and Cabral headed home. Just six minutes later Michael Lang added a second, Pajtim Kasami headed a corner against the crossbar and Lang netted the rebound. On 40 minutes a corner is cleared too short by the Kairat defence, and the ball is returned to the centre and Lang doubled his personal tally. They could have made it four before the break, but Fabian Frei's long-range effort landed on the top of the net. Three minutes after the break a good move from the centre midfield to Basel's left, Matías Palacios to Tomás Tavares and his low cross is side footed into the net by Dan Ndoye. Basel with the four-goal lead reduced tempo and Kairat took advantage, Kairat top-scorer José Kanté in the 65th and Ricardo Alves per penalty in the 69th reduced the advantage. Basel let the game run off and the end score 4–2 left a clear explanation of the happenings.

Basel were hosts to Omonia on matchday 3 of the group stage. The St. Jakob-Park had an attendance of 10,056 fans and they saw both teams starting well into game. Basel then gained themselves an advantage and on 18 minutes Pajtim Kasami forced his way to the right almost to the by-line and hit the post with his shot from an acute angle. The ball rebounded back into the box where Liam Miller acted quickly and scored. Basel had things under control from then. However, Omonia remained unpredictable and as Marko Scepovic advanced down the left and entered into the penalty-box he was brought to fall. Referee Ms Stéphanie Frappart of the French Football Federation awarded the visitors a spot-kick, which Jordi Gómez converted straight down the middle on 26 minutes. On 40 minutes a handball inside the visitors’ box, again the whistle and this time Arthur Cabral converted to put the hosts back in front. In the second half, the Basel team created various good chances to increase the result. Darian Males narrowly failed, while substitute Matias Palacios hit the crossbar via the goalkeeper's fist. With one exception, they did not allow any dangers with their defensive actions and they held everything under control. Edon Zhegrova clarified all matters with the 3–1 after a counterattack in the 88th minute.

The GSP Stadium in Nicosia is the largest stadium in Cyprus and has a capacity of 22,859. However, on matchday 4 the attendance was just 4,597 fans as Omonia played hosts to Basel. The visitors determined the rhythm of play, but kept it low and thus gave the advantage to Omonia's defensive work. In the first counterattack of the game in the 16th minute, Eray Cömert was duped by striker Andronikos Kakoullis, who scored from 10 meters out. Basel continued to dominate, but they made a largely unexciting performance. After the break head coach brought Matías Palacios and Darian Males into play and then the team found access to the game. A decisive move came in the 57th minute. First Tomas Tavares knocked over his opponent in the penalty area, but referee Vitali Meshkov of the Russian Football Union correctly let play continue and in return Liam Millar equalized with his left foot from a half-right position after an opening pass from Darian Males. In the final phase, FCB were no longer in danger of losing their advantage and were close to getting th winning goal. Arthur Cabral hit the bar in the 82nd minute after a corner.

Kairat play their home games in the Central Stadium in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The distance between Basel and Almaty is somewhat over 5,000 kilometres or about 8 hours flying time and the time zone difference is 5 hours. There was an attendance of 4,159 fans present as referee Goga Kikacheishvili of the Georgian Football Federation blew his whistle for kick-off. Basel started fast into the game, pressing forwards, they were awarded three corner-kicks in the first two minutes. However, it took a quarter of an hour until the first shot was fired at goal, but Wouter Burger's efforts was sent too central and keeper Stas Pokatilov had no problems with it. After this starting offensive Kairat came better in the game and after a move from the right Vágner Love was stood alone as the ball came to him and he was able to side foot it home. Up until the break, creative moves were rare with the exception of one Basel attack that ended with a foul on Valentin Stocker and Arthur Cabral converted the spot kick. After the interval Kairat were the better team and on 56 minutes Kamo Hovhannisyan put the hosts back into the lead. Up until 70 minutes there was nothing to indicate that FCB would take even one point with them and the Kazakhs could and should have led significantly higher than with 2–1. But Edon Zhegrova, who had been substituted on five minutes earlier, with a magnificent shot from 25 meters under the crossbar, as well as Pajtim Kasami following a nice attack via Zhegrova and Tomas Tavares, brought the turnaround within four minutes. The Basel team were twice behind against Kairat Almaty, but win 3–2 and remain undefeated in the group stage after five rounds. Because in the second game of group H, leaders Qarabağ Agdam and Omonia Nicosia drew 2–2, Basel and Qarabağ were level on points before the direct duel in the 6th round.

The starting position before the game was clear. Basel and Qarabağ were level with 11 points apiece, eight more than third-placed Omonia, and with the same goal difference (+5), Basel occupied top spot by virtue of having scored a goal more, Basel totaled 11–6 goals, Qarabağ 10–5. This meant that a draw on Matchday 6 would keep Basel in top space. Qarabağ had to win at St. Jakob-Park to qualify directly for the round of 16.

The St. Jakob-Park had an attendance of 10,059 spectators on this cloudy and cold evening and the pitch was reported as dry and good. Shortly after kick-off Basel would actually have fallen behind after just one minute. Qarabağ's Frenchman Abdellah Zoubir hit at goal with a low shot. The ball had crossed the goal line by about three feet when defender Sergio Lopez "cleared". The referee Fran Jović of the Croatian Football Federation let play continue. Qarabağ had another chance a few minutes later, two good passes bridging the midfield and Ibrahima Wadji was free behind the defence, but Heinz Lindner was equal to his attempt. Another few minutes later two quick passes and Patrick Andrade forced the keeper to make another diving save. Basel could not get their opponents under control, but after this 10-minute tempo start from the visitors, Basel came into the game. Nearly half an hour played Edon Zhegrova dribbled through the visitors’ defence, but as he is stopped the loose ball comes to Arthur Cabral. However, his shot is a big save from the diving keeper Shahrudin Mahammadaliyev. Basel then took control of the game. Edon Zhegrova had a shot, this was diverted to Cabral, who put the ball into the net, but the referee decides on off-side, a mistake because the ball game from a defender. Another minute later the next chance, the play is now a game on one goal. Zhegrova pass to López, pass to Kasami, high ball to Matias Palacios, who flicked the ball into the centre, 1-0 after 33 minutes as Arthur Cabral scored with a header. Basel had more chances before the break, the best being Cabral's bicycle kick just before the interval.

Qarabağ started the second period as they had the first, pushing forward, but their best chance was hit over the top in the 50th minute from just three meters out by the Senegalese Wadji. Again, head coach Patrick Rahmen's team knew how to absorb the problems and fought back into the game. Cabral ran through the entire Qarabağ defence toward the goal, he left all defenders behind him, but goalie Mahammadaliyev saved his attempt. Again Cabral, this time on the right-side line, he sent Dan Ndoye forwards into space, his cross was headed against the cross bar and Pajtim Kasami pushed the rebound over the line on 62 minutes. With Cabral's 3–0 after 74 minutes, the decision was made. But how the goal was made was unique, probably something that was never seen before. Tomás Tavares sent Ndoye down the right flank with a well timed passed. Ndoye played the cross toward the centre and Cabral after falling flat, lying on the pitch, headed the ball into the net. The 3–0 score was the result at full time.

From the six group games of the newly created Conference League, FC Basel got almost everything they could get out of it. With 14 out of the possible 18 points, they did a lot to ensure that the Swiss Super League could improve its position in the UEFA country ranking at the end of the season. Thanks to the group victory, the team skipped the round of 32 and they will enter the knockout phase in the round of 16. In addition to this, the four wins and the two draws will add 2,3 million euros in prize money into the club's finance account.

The draw for the knockout round play-offs was held on 13 December 2021, 14:00 CET and in the round of 32 Qarabağ were drawn against Olympique de Marseille. The first legs will be played on 17 February, and the second legs will be played on 24 February 2022.


#### Round of 16

The draw for the round of 16 was held on 25 February 2022, 13:00 CET. Basel were seeded and were drawn against Marseille. The first legs were played on 10 March, and the second legs were played on 17 March 2022.

FC Basel lost the round of 16 first leg in the Conference League away at Olympique Marseille 1–2. Sebastiano Esposito kept Basel's hopes of progressing alive. He stayed cool in the 79th minute after a dream pass from substitute Wouter Burger and reduced the score for the visitors. And six minutes later, Basel were only inches away from equalizing. Marseille defender Valentin Rongier caught goalkeeper Steve Mandanda on the footed with a header back pass, so that Mandanda was only able to get the ball off the line in extremis. The 2–2 would have been too much of a good thing. Because, despite this being the first defeat in the current campaign, the result from Basel's point of view was the best thing on that evening in the Stade Vélodrome in the southern French metropolis. FCB was clearly inferior to the third-placed Ligue 1 team for almost 80 minutes and could have lost significantly higher. Arkadiusz Milik's two goals were too meager for Marseille, who were relegated to third-tier competition being third placed in the Europa League group. In the 19th minute, the Pole scored with a foul penalty after Nice-born Andy Pelmard acted impetuously and naively in his own penalty area. In the 68th minute, Milik scored the 2–0 following a rebound from Basel's keeper Heinz Lindner. Gerson's clever quick flick was picked up by Rongier who was in space in the middle. He powers forward before unleashing a low drive which Lindner was unable to hold, and the Polish international was quickest to react to the loose ball, blasting it into the roof of the net. Milik alone could have scored two more goals, in the 36th minute he failed alone with only Lindner to beat and in the 61st minute he only hit the post. The lively Cengiz Ünder cut in from the touchline and played a defence-splitting pass toward the right hand side of the box for the goalscorer to run onto. He raced across the area and hit a hard right-footed effort that cracked back from the base of the upright.

Because on this evening a completely different FCB was on the field than a week before, as the French team were mostly clearly superior in terms of play and it was only their inability in their finishing, or at other times the reactions of a strong goalkeeper Heinz Lindner that prevented the FCB from suffering a higher defeat than that 1–2. The Austrian keeper was also a backup for the team of caretaker coach Guillermo Abascal in this second leg. He was at the origin of a moment that made the 22,081 spectators in the St. Jakob-Park believe in duel's a turning point with the second placed team in the French Ligue 1. In the 35th minute, Lindner dived doen to the right corner and saved Amine Harit's penalty kick. This had been caused due to a clumsy tackle by Wouter Burger after FCB defence had moved far to forward taking their own corner kick. It wouldn't remain the FCB goalie's only save. Against Cédric Bakambu, who had hammered the rebound from Lindner's penalty save into the night sky, Lindner reacted outstandingly several times. In this way he kept the hopes for his team alive, after all, one goal would have been enough for extra time.

And that one goal was to come. Sebastiano Esposito, the scorer from the first leg, brought a wide cross back into the box in the 62nd minute, where Dan Ndoye eluded his opponent and headed past Steve Mandanda in the Marseille goal. It was the reward for the committed performance of an FCB, who had recently appeared more stable in the championship. Until Gerson and Cengiz Ünder abruptly stopped Basel's upswing. After conceding the first goal, Basel rarely managed to get play into the danger zone, Marseille had more control of the game, and after a counterattack in added time, Valentin Rongier ensured that OM also won the second leg 2–1.

FC Basel also lost the return leg in the round of 16 of the Conference League 1–2 against Olympique Marseille. They were eliminated and could not reward themselves for a long, hard and convincing performance. OM defeated PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals and were drawn against Feyenoord in the semi-finals.
