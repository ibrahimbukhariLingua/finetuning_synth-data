# Vodafone España



**Vodafone España, S.A.U.** is a mobile telecommunications operator in Spain headquartered in Madrid. It was founded in 2001, as a result of the merger of the shares held by Vodafone and British Telecom, and Airtel.

The company offers GSM900/1800 MHz (2G), UMTS (3G), HSDPA (3.5G) and 4G LTE services in Spain.

In 2007, Vodafone acquired the Spanish operations of Tele2, and subsequently acquired the cable operator ONO in 2014.

In January 2019, it reported, through a statement to the workers' representatives, the opening of a collective dismissal procedure "for economic, productive and organizational reasons" that would affect a maximum of 1,200 employees, on 23, 5% of the workforce. In May 2019, Vodafone Spain announced the launch of 5G technology in the summer in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Malaga, Seville and Valencia.

Its motto was *Es tu momento. Es Vodafone.* (It's your moment. It's Vodafone.). Its former slogan was Vodafone's previous global slogan, "Power to you". And "El Futuro Es Apasionante. Ready?". (The Future is Exciting. Ready?). Its current slogan is Vodafone's current global slogan, "Together we can".
