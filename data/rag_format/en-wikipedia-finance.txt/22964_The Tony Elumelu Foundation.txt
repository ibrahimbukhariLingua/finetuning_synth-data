# The Tony Elumelu Foundation



The **Tony Elumelu Foundation** (TEF) is an African non-profit organization founded in 2010 by Tony O. Elumelu and headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria. It is a pioneer member of the Global Impact Investment Rating System (GIIRS). So far, the Foundation has empowered over 18,000 African entrepreneurs across 54 African countries.


## History

The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) was founded in 2010 by Nigerian businessman Tony O. Elumelu, as an extension of his unwavering belief in the youth as catalysts for Africa's transformation. The Tony Elumelu Foundation, the leading philanthropy empowering a new generation of African entrepreneurs, has become the hallmark for Africa's sustainable development through jobs creation, poverty eradication and women's economic empowerment.

The Foundation's mission is rooted in Africapitalism, which positions the private sector, and most importantly entrepreneurs, as the catalyst for the social and economic development of the African continent.

In 2015, TEF consolidated its various programmes and Initiatives and made investing in Africa's next generation of entrepreneurs and business leaders a priority. The future of the Tony Elumelu Foundation centres on the provision of structured, robust, and multifaceted support to entrepreneurs around Africa through the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme; a 10-year US$100 million commitment to identify, train, mentor and fund 10,000 young African entrepreneurs across 54 African countries.

Since the launch of the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme in 2015, the Foundation has trained over 1.5 million young Africans on www.tefconnect.com, Africa's largest digital entrepreneurship ecosystem, and disbursed nearly US$100 million in direct funding to over 18,000 African women and men, who have collectively created over 400,000 direct and indirect jobs.
