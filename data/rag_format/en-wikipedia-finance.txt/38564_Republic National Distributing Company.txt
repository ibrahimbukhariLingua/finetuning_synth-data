## History


### Distribution Tier

The Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution repealing prohibition led to the creation of a three-tier state-based system of beverage alcohol regulation consisting of the product supplier, distributors who are licensed by the state, and the retail seller. Individual states are provided with the right to control how alcohol is distributed within their own borders.


### Company Evolution

The earliest predecessor company of RNDC traces its roots back to a single distributorship founded in 1898 in Pensacola, Florida. RNDC was created on May 1, 2007, following the successful merger of the former Republic Beverage Company and National Distributing Company. Both companies were successful, privately owned liquor wholesalers that possessed complementary characteristics, making them a perfect fit for a large scale merger. Acquisitions have included Julius Schepps Co. in Texas, N. Goldring, Inc. in Florida, and Best Brands of Oklahoma. It completed an acquisition of Young's Market Company in November, 2022, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.
