## History

CapStar Bank was co-founded by Dennis C. Bottorff and Claire W. Tucker on July 14, 2008, with U.S. $88 million. It had grown upwards of U.S. $3 billion in assets by 2021.

In 2018, four years after its parent CapStar Financial Holdings (CSFH) formed Farmington Mortgage as its home mortgage subsidiary, the bank acquired Athens Bancshares Corp. (Athens Federal Community Bank), adding eight East Tennessee financial centers. In 2020, it purchased FBC Corporation, including the First National Bank of Manchester and the Bank of Waynesboro.

In April 2024, it was announced that CSFH had completed the merger of its operations with those of Old National Bancorp. With this transaction, CapStar Bank will become a division of Old National.
