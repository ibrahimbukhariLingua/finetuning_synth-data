## History

SeaChange was founded in January 1993 by Bill Styslinger. In 1996, the company became listed at NASDAQ. In April 2005, SeaChange bought the international assets of Liberate Technologies.

In September 2005, SeaChange acquired UK-based On-Demand Group (ODG). In November 2008, SeaChange acquired Mobix Interactive, also from the UK.

In September 2009, SeaChange bought eventIS, based in the Netherlands. In January 2010, SeaChange acquired Silicon Valley start-up VividLogic. In June 2012, SeaChange obtained the assets of Flashlight Engineering and Consulting.

As part of a strategy to become a "pure-play software provider,‚Äù SeaChange did two divestitures: in May 2012, it sold ODG to Avail-TVN and its server hardware business spun out to XOR Media that same month. In 2014 SeaChange acquired Timeline Labs, a start-up that makes tools for broadcasters and video service providers for audience measurement via social media.

SeaChange appointed Ed Terino as their new CEO in 2016, who stepped down on 24 February 2019 amid a conflict with the largest shareholder. On 27 September 2021, Peter D. Aquino was appointed as CEO.

In 2024, almost three years after reporting wanting to merge with TrillerNet, it was announced that it could be acquired by the Montreal-headquartered enterprise software company, PartnerOne for $30 million. However, on May 9, 2024, Enghouse Systems Ltd. announced that it had completed the purchase of all of the company's assets for approximately $23 million.
