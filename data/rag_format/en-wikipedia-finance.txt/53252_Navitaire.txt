## History

Navitaire was founded as PRA Solutions in 1993 by Accenture. It initially provided airline revenue accounting software and revenue protection software for airlines. The company then developed a direct-distribution platform to book airline reservations, "World Network," an alternative to the global distribution system traditionally used by travel agents to sell airline flights. In 2000, PRA Solutions purchased the Open Skies reservation system from Hewlett Packard, and in 2001, changed its name to Navitaire.

In 2002, the firm implemented codeshare technology for Virgin Blue, and the company later introduced multi-city bookings at the request of Jetstar. Following Hewlett Packard's announcement in 2001 of its plans to discontinue support for the HP3000 hardware that the Open Skies system operated on, Navitaire developed a replacement reservation system called New Skies. The company began converting clients to the new system in 2005. Navitaire was acquired by Amadeus in 2015.
