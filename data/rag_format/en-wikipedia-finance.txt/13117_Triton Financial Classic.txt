## Tournament highlights

* 2003: Hale Irwin wins the inaugural edition of the tournament by defeating Tom Watson on the second hole of a sudden death playoff. This in spite of a final round meltdown by Irwin that included his throwing a ball in the creek after making double bogey and, on another hole, he whiffed on a very short putt, and then topped the next.
* 2008: Denis Watson birdies the 54th hole to win by one shot over Nick Price. Price looked to be in command of the tournament until he made double bogey on both the 51st and 52nd holes.
* 2009: Bernhard Langer wins the last edition of the tournament by six shots over Dana Quigley and Mark O'Meara.
