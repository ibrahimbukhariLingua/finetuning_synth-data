## History

FNZ was founded in 2003 by its former Group CEO, Adrian Durham. It began as a business unit within the New Zealand branch of investment bank Credit Suisse. This was followed by the expansion of operations to the UK in 2005, and a management buyout of the First NZ Capital Group (formerly Credit Suisse) in January 2009 for a price of NZ$34 million, backed by private equity firm H.I.G. Capital.

In 2012, global growth equity firm General Atlantic acquired a minority share in FNZ.

In June 2013, Lord Leitch was appointed Group Chairman of FNZ.

In October 2018, CDPQ and Generation Investment Management agreed to purchase the two-thirds ownership of FNZ from HIG Capital and General Atlantic in a deal valuing FNZ at Â£1.6 billion.

In February 2020, Temasek acquired a stake in FNZ.

In February 2022, FNZ raised US$1.4 billion in new capital from CPP Investments and Motive Partners which valued FNZ at US$20 billion.

In August 2024, Durham stepped down as CEO, into the role of non-executive Founding Director and Senior Adviser. He was replaced by Blythe Masters as Group CEO and Roman Regelman as Group President. In tandem with the leadership change, FNZ announced a further US$1bn of capital from its existing institutional investors.

Gregor Stewart was appointed as Group Chair in 2024, with Lord Leitch becoming Group Chair Emeritus.


### Acquisitions

In July 2019, FNZ acquired London-based JHC Systems Ltd, a provider of platform software to the wealth management industry.

In November 2019, FNZ acquired GBST for A$269m, which prompted the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to launch an inquiry into the deal's impact on competition in the UK retail investment platform market. The final decision from the CMA was for FNZ to sell GBST with rights to repurchase GBST's capital markets operations.
