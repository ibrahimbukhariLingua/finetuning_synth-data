# Hong Kong Economic Journal



The ***Hong Kong Economic Journal*** (**HKEJ**). is a Chinese-language daily newspaper published in Hong Kong by the **Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd.**. Available in both Hong Kong and Macau, the newspaper mainly focuses on economic news and other related, usually political issues. The newsjournal is also available to some air passengers – those travelling to the United States, Canada, and Europe. It is authorised by the Hong Kong government to publish announcements related to some law issues.


## History

The *Hong Kong Economic Journal* was founded by Lam Shan-muk [zh] (林山木), commonly known by his pen name Lam Hang-chi (林行止), who first worked as a data collector for *Ming Pao* during the 1960s and later as an assistant editor for the evening version of *Ming Pao*—and Law Chi-Ping (Chinese: 羅治平; Jyutping: *lo4 zi6 ping4*) – who withdrew his shares later. Together they saw the possibility of developing an economic journal for the Hong Kong public in the early 1970s (although some sources have suggested that it was Lok Yau-Mui (駱友梅), his wife, and not Law Chi-Ping who was the true co-founderᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ) and the newspaper was first published on 3 July 1973.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In July 2008, HKEJ launched its official website *hkej.com* which contains the daily newspaper content, instant news, real time stock quotes and different kinds of financial data and information.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In February 2011, HKEJ launched its English website, *EJ Insight*.

In July 2016 the paper suspended the column of Joseph Lian Yi-zheng (練乙錚). Lian, a former member of the Central Policy Unit as well as the former editor-in-chief of HKEJ, had recently written pieces sympathetic to the localist movement, leading to allegations that his dismissal was motivated by self-censorship. A group of current and former HKEJ staff penned a letter demanding that editor-in-chief Alice Kwok Yim-ming revoke and explain the decision.


### Ownership

It was reported that, as early as 10 January 2006, the Lam's family was in negotiation with Richard Li (head of Hong Kong–based telecommunication giant PCCW) and another local mass-media company for the sale of the newspaper.

On 9 August 2006, Clemont Media Limited, in which Li is the settler of the trust, bought a 50% stake in the newspaper. In August 2014, Clermont Media Limited acquired the remaining shares from Shun Po Company Limited and wholly owned the company.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
