## History

Established as a School of Commerce in 1925, the School has grown from offering B.A. and BComm degrees to offering an MBA programme since 1964 when it was transformed into a School of Business Studies. A full suite of Masters programmes exist today and this began in 1976 when the MSc (Mgmt) degree in Management Practice for practicing senior executives was launched, with a curriculum based on action research principles. The School is part of the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences of Trinity College.

The new â‚¬80 million 11,400 square metre Trinity Business School building was opened in 2019 and includes an innovation and entrepreneurial hub, a 600-seat auditorium, restaurant spaces for up to 200 people, smart classrooms and a rooftop conference room. It is a near zero energy building, with some 500sq m of photovoltaic panels installed on the roof contribute to the electrical provision of the building and offsetting 35 tonnes of carbon per annum.
