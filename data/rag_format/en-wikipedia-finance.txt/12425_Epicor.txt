## History


### 1972–2000

Advanced Business Microsystems (ABM) was a company founded in 1984. ABM created a suite of accounting software for MS-DOS and marketed them in a joint venture with IBM known as The Platinum Series. ABM developed the Platinum line into a financial accounting software product designed for multi-user LAN-based environments. ABM was renamed Platinum Software Corporation in 1992 in preparation for its initial public offering.

Platinum announced a version of their products for Microsoft Windows in 1993.
Platinum acquired Clientele in 1997, and FocusSoft, an extension to Platinum's existing distribution solution. After a year, Platinum merged with DataWorks to extend its manufacturing solutions and operations. DataWorks Corporation was founded in 1977 (as Budget Computer Systems, San Diego, CA) specializing in integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems targeted at high tech sector companies. In 1999, Platinum/DataWorks became Epicor Software Corporation.
