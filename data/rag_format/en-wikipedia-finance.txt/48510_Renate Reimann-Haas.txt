## Life and career

Reimann-Haas is the great-great-granddaughter of Karl Ludwig Reimann and comes from the wealthy entrepreneurial family Reimann. She is the oldest biological daughter of Albert Reimann from his illegitimate relationship with Emilie Landecker (1922-2017). In 1965, she was adopted by Albert together with her two siblings Wolfgang Reimann and Andrea Reimann-Ciardelli.

In 1984, Reimann-Haas inherited 11.1% of Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH from her father, which in 1999 merged with the British listed company Reckitt & Colman to form Reckitt Benckiser. In 2005, together with her brother Wolfgang and her half-siblings Stefan Reimann-Andersen and Matthias Reimann-Andersen, she founded the non-profit Benckiser Stiftung Zukunft. In 2019, as a result of the family's involvement with the Nazi regime, the foundation was transferred to the Alfred Landecker Foundation based in Berlin.
