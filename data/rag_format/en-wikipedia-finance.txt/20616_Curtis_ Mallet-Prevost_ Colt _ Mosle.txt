## History

The law firm was founded in 1830 in New York City by Connecticut natives and brothers, John L. and James L. Graham, who established their legal practice at 143 Fulton Street, Manhattan, today's Financial District. The Graham and Curtis families had a history of intermarriage in Connecticut and, in 1838, the firm admitted partner William Curtis Noyes, the son of a state Supreme Court justice. The firm merged in 1852 with another legal partnership established by a member of the Curtis family and moved to new premises on Wall Street. In 1899, Severo Mallet-Prevost joined the firm. In 1925, the firm's current name was adopted, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle. The firm established its Washington, D.C. office in 1963, followed by an office in Paris in the 1970s, and has continued to expand globally, to 19 international offices. The firm presently maintains its headquarters in the H. J. Kalikow and Co., Inc. building at 101 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.


## Performance

In February 2009, despite a weak economy, the firm reported a 13.5% surge in revenue, pushing profits per partner to the $1 million mark, a record for the firm. Revenues per lawyer were reported at $570,000.
