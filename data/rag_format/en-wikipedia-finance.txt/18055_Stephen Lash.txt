**Stephen Lash** (born February 10, 1940) is founder of Christie's North America and the Chairman Emeritus of Christie's New York.


## Biography

Growing up in Brookline, Massachusetts, Lash was the son of art aficionados who frequented museums, galleries and auctions. He went on to attend Avon Old Farms boarding school for boys, received a bachelor's degree from Yale University, and later an MBA from Columbia Business School.

Prior to joining Christie's in 1976, Lash was vice president at the London-based investment bank S. G. Warburg & Co. - eventually acquired by UBS in 1998 - and was mayoral appointee to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. He also served as a Trustee of the Preservation League of New York State and the Park Avenue Armory.


## Christie's North America

Christie's, founded in London in 1766, hired Lash in 1976 to lead a team to launch the firm's New York salesroom on Park Avenue. A year later, in 1977, it became the first Christie's office in North America. Lash helped expand the operation, his responsibilities grew, and he eventually became the first chairman of *Christie's Americas*. The now sprawling offices have been at Rockefeller Center since 1997.

Since joining Christie's, Lash has been involved in numerous historic art acquisitions, including the sale of Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet for $82.5 million in 1990, the sale of four Gustav Klimt paintings for $192.2 million in 2006, and the sale of Elizabeth Taylor's collection for $156.7 million in 2012.

In 2022, Christie's sold $8.4 billion in art and luxury goods worldwide, an all-time high for any auction house.


## Historic sale of Klimts

Under Lash's direction in 2006, the collection of Adele Bloch-Bauer niece Maria Altmann, which included four paintings by Gustav Klimt looted by the Nazi's during World War II and returned to Altmann after a decade-long legal battle, sold at Christie's in a record 7 minutes, garnering $192.2 million. The paintings were Adele Bloch-Bauer II ($87.9 million), *Apple Tree I* ($33 million), *Birch Trees* ($40.3 million), and *Houses at Attersee* ($31 million), all selling to undisclosed buyers. Lash later revealed that Oprah Winfrey was the buyer of Adele Bloch-Bauer II. A fifth and final Klimt, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, sold in a private sale to billionaire Ronald Lauder in 2006 for $135 million, at that time the highest price ever paid for a work of art.

Eleven years later in 2017, *Salvator Mundi* was sold at Christie's in New York for $450.3 million, the current highest price ever paid for a painting.


## Past and current boards

Lash has served as the co-chair of the Maritime Visiting Committee at the Peabody Essex Museum, and he was the founder and first president of the Ocean Liner Museum, the only museum in the world dedicated to the history and preservation of passenger vessels. He serves on the boards of the Museum of the City of New York, The New York Landmarks Conservancy, and he is co-chairman of the *American Friends of the* Israel Museum. He is also the Acting President and Trustee of the New York University Institute of Fine Arts.
