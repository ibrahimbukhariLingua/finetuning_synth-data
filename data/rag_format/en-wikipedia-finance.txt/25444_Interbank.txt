**Interbank**, formally the **Banco Internacional del Perú Service Holding S.A.A.** is a Peruvian provider of financial services.


## History

In 1897, Elias Mujica opened an agency at the Jirón de la Unión in Lima's historic centre under the name of *Banco Internacional*. In 1934, branches were opened in Chiclayo and Arequipa, and later expansions included Piura, Sullana and other places in Peru.

Under the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado, in 1970, the national bank (Banco de la Nación) purchased *Banco Internacional* and changed its name to *Banca Asociada del País*. Ten years later, under the democratic government of Fernando Belaunde Terry, the bank changed its name to *InterBanc* but it was still property of the Peruvian government.

In July 1994, Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor Sr. along with several North American businessmen purchased 91% of the bank's stocks. The new owners changed the name to *Interbank*.

Part of the expansion strategy at that point was to open agency branches in supermarkets so customers could shop and bank at the same time.

In 2004, Interbank bought the supermarket chain Supermercados Santa Isabel from the transnational Ahold, and they founded Supermercados Peruanos. They have offices inside Vivanda and Plaza Vea stores. Currently, Interbank has 230 branches, called "tiendas" or stores, over 1,500 ATMs, and over 1,500 Interbank Agentes in Peru.

In 2007, Interbank opened a business agency in Shanghai, China in order to facilitate negotiations between Chinese and Peruvians.

Luis Felipe Castellanos López-Torres holds the position of General Manager (CEO) since 2011.
