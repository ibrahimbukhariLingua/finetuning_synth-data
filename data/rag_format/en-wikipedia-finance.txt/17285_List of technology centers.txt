List of technology centers


# List of technology centers



This is a list some of **technology centers** throughout the world. Government planners and business networks often incorporate "silicon" or "valley" into place names to describe their own areas as a result of the success of Silicon Valley in California. Metrics may be applied to measure qualitative differences between these places, including:

* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development (R&D) funds are spent in the zones
* What percentage of local employment is technology related
* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or is it a mix of both)
* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporations have headquarters there
* If mainly corporate, how much venture capital has been made available to companies in the zone
* What supporting higher educational institutions (e.g., universities or colleges) are located nearby

## Globally prominent clusters
