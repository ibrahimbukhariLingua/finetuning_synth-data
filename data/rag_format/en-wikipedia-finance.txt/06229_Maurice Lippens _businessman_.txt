Maurice Lippens started his professional career in South Africa to assist with the reorganisation of the *Maatschappij voor Zeevisserij* where he stayed for five months, and then served his military service duties in the Belgian army.

Afterwards, he went through an apprenticeship at the *Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas* (financial analysis), followed by the Générale de Banque in financial management. After he graduated from Harvard Business School (MBA), he held management positions at *Scienta S.A.*, the *Société Européenne de Venture Capital*. He then took over a company in Brussels on his own account, which was resold in 1979.

Maurice Lippens joined the AG Group [nl] in 1981, in 1983, he became managing director, and then Chairman / Managing Director in 1988. He has been the Chairman of Fortis since 1990, participating to the creation of the group. In 2000, he became chairman of the executive committee of Fortis.

In 2012, a Dutch court cleared Maurice Lippens for the misleading financial information published by Fortis in May–June 2008. In 2018, the Belgian justice dropped charges against seven ex-directors of Fortis, including Maurice Lippens, considering that they could not have foreseen the subprime mortgage crisis.
