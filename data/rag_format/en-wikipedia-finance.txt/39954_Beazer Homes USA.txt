## Controversies


### Predatory lending and violations in mortgage servicing business

In March 2007, the company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina seeking documents related to its mortgage loan origination services. The investigation followed articles in *The Charlotte Observer* which noted that the company's aggressive sales tactics led to an unusually high foreclosure rate in its developments.


#### Alleged violations of securities laws

In July 2007, the company was investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after Chief Accounting Officer Michael T. Rand was fired for violating ethics policies by attempting to destroy documents related to the company's mortgage origination services.

In 2014, Rand was found guilty of conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges.


#### $50 million settlement

On July 1, 2009, the company reached a $50 million settlement with several government agencies and admitted to fraudulent mortgage practices including retaining mortgage points that should have been used to lower interest rates charged, misinforming buyers that they were receiving down payment help when instead the price of the home was increased, circumventing HUD watch list programs, and ignoring borrower incomes when originating loans.


### Settlement of captive title insurance kickback allegations

On October 30, 2007, the company agreed to pay $261,000 as part of a $1.4 million settlement by 6 home construction companies to resolve allegations by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that title insurance companies paid kickbacks to the builders in exchange for referrals. The companies denied wrongdoing and said that they settled to avoid legal expenses.
