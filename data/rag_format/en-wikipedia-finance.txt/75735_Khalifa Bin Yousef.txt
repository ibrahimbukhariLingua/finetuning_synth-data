# Khalifa Bin Yousef



**Khalifa Bin Yousef**, also **Khalifa Bin Yousef Al Suwaidi**, was a statesman who played a significant role in the unification of The United Arab Emirates and in the economic and political life of the time in the Persian Gulf.


## Early life

Born in 1905 in Abu Dhabi, Khalifa Bin Yousef was the eldest to his father, Yousef bin Ahmed bin Obaid Al Suwaidi. In the beginning of the 20th century, there was no direct trade lines between Abu Dhabi and India, and Abu Dhabi's imports and exports went through Bahrain. Khalifa took over the family business that was established on a single Arabian Dhow, importing rice, sugar, spices, and basic products and consumables.


## Business

When the pearling era in Abu Dhabi came to an end, Khalifa Bin Yousef looked for new direction for his business. Soon he was representing major industries like British Petroleum (BP), Rothmans, Philips, Rainbow Milk, Palmolive, Vauxhall Motors and Bedford Motors.

In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of British Petroleum, obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate it, titled Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA), and was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later, Total). Using a marine drilling platform, the ADMA Enterprise struck oil in the Umm Shaif field in 1958. The Murban field followed in 1960, then Bu Hasa in 1962 and the Zakum offshore field in 1965.


## Influence on economy

Some of Khalifa Bin Yousef's projects and contributions remain today as major institutions in the United Arab Emirates. He helped establish and lead The National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce, and Abu Dhabi Television company. He was also a board member in the committee responsible for investment of government funds, today known as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

In 1968, National Bank of Abu Dhabi was established. It was the number one bank in Abu Dhabi, the first and only commercial bank, and the first National bank as well. Khalifa Bin Yousef suggested to Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Ruler of Abu Dhabi at that time, to establish the bank: "Instead of investing in foreign banks, Abu Dhabi should have its own bank for its own people". The establishment of National Bank of Abu Dhabi was made by Khalifa bin Yousef, and was chaired by him until he died in 1971.

In August 1969, The Ruler of Abu Dhabi permitted Khalifa bin Yousef to establish Abu Dhabi Television Company. In September of the same year, he was one of those who drove the effort to establish Abu Dhabi's Chamber of Commerce and & Industry, becoming also a board member.

He managed the foreign relations and was responsible for the negotiations held with some of the oil companies working in the country today.

When Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan became the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, and subsequently unified the seven Emirates into one country in 1971, Khalifa Bin Yousef played a central role in the architecture and diplomacy that led to the unification and the creation of The United Arab Emirates.
