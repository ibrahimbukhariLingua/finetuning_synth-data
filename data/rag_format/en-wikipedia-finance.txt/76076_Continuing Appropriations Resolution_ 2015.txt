Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015


# Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015



The **Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015** (H.J.Res. 124; Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 113–164 (text) (PDF)) is a continuing resolution and United States public law that funded the federal government of the United States through December 11, 2014 by appropriating $1 trillion.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.


## Background

A continuing resolution is a type of appropriations legislation. An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The *fiscal year* is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. When Congress and the president fail to agree on and pass one or more of the regular appropriations bills, a continuing resolution can be passed instead. A continuing resolution continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year (or with minor modifications) for a set amount of time. Continuing resolutions typically provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous year's funding. The funding extends until a specific date or regular appropriations bills are passed, whichever comes first. There can be some changes to some of the accounts in a continuing resolution. The continuing resolution takes the form of a joint resolution, and may provide bridging funding for existing federal programs at current, reduced, or expanded levels.

## Debate and discussion

In the House, both support and opposition to the bill was bipartisan in nature. Voting in support of the bill were 143 Democrats and 176 Republicans, while 55 Democrats and 53 Republicans voted against it.

Some conservative Republicans opposed the reauthorization of the Ex-Im bank.

The ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Nita Lowey (NY), said that she wanted to pass regular appropriations bills prior to the end of the 113th Congress in order to ensure that the 114th United States Congress did not get to set the appropriations levels, in case Congress was controlled by Republicans at that time.

The bill includes a 1 percent raise for federal employees in 2015.

Rep. Rogers, who introduced the bill, said that "this is a critical measure that ensures that hard-working Americans continue to have access to the government programs and services they rely on, and helps avoid the unnecessary uncertainty and economic harm caused by the threat of a government shutdown."

The bill was amended to include an authorization for the administration to train and arm Syrian rebels in order to better equip them to fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
