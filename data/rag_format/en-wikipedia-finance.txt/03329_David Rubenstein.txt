David Rubenstein


# David Rubenstein



**David Mark Rubenstein** (born August 11, 1949) is an American lawyer, businessman, and philanthropist. A former government official, he is a co-founder and co-chairman of The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm based in Washington, D.C. Rubenstein is also the principal owner of the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB), acquiring the team in 2024 for $1.7 billion.

Rubenstein is the chairman of the National Gallery of Art, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. He is a former board of trustees chairman at Duke University and the Smithsonian Institution. He served as co-chair of the board at Brookings Institution. In 2022, he became chair of the University of Chicago's board of trustees. According to *Forbes*, Rubenstein had an estimated net worth of $3.7 billion in mid-2024.

Rubenstein was the chairman of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts from 2010 until 2025, when he was replaced by Donald Trump.


## Early life and education

Rubenstein grew up as an only child in a Jewish family in Baltimore. His father was a United States Postal Service file clerk whose family emigrated from Ukraine. Rubenstein's mother was a homemaker and then began working in a dress shop when he was six years old. He later recalled: "When I was young, Baltimore was a religiously segregated city. The Jews were in the northwest part of town, and it was very much a ghetto situation. I was 13 before I realized everyone in the world was not Jewish. Up to that point, everyone I knew was Jewish."

Rubenstein graduated from the college preparatory high school Baltimore City College in 1966, an all-male school at the time. He then attended Duke University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated *magna cum laude* with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1970. He earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1973, and was an editor of the *University of Chicago Law Review*.


## Career


### Early law career

From 1973 to 1975, Rubenstein practiced law in New York with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. From 1975 to 1976, he served as chief counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments. Rubenstein also served as a deputy domestic policy advisor to President Jimmy Carter and worked in private practice with Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge in Washington, D.C.


### The Carlyle Group

In 1987, Rubenstein founded The Carlyle Group with William E. Conway Jr. and Daniel A. D'Aniello. The firm has grown into a global investment firm with $426 billion of assets under management as of 2023, and more than 1,800 employees in 31 offices on six continents.

In 2006, Rubenstein expressed fear that the private equity boom would end, saying, "This has been a golden age for our industry, but nothing continues to be golden forever." One month later, he said, "Right now we're operating as if the music's not going to stop playing and the music is going to stop. I am more concerned about this than any other issue". According to Phiwa Nkambule, "These concerns proved to be right, as at the end of 2007, the buyout market collapsed... As leveraged loan activity came to an abrupt stop, private equity firms were unable to secure financing for their transactions." However, Rubenstein's outlook quickly rebounded, and in 2008, he said,"But once this period is over, once the debt on the books of the banks is sold and new lending starts, I think you'll see the private equity industry coming back in what I call the Platinum Age – better than it's ever been before. I do think that the private equity industry has a great future and that the greatest period for private equity is probably ahead of us." Reflecting on this period in 2018, Rubenstein argued that "actually most of the deals done in the heyday of the Great Recession pretty much worked out," and that the private equity industry had been "strengthened so much that now it’s the greatest time we’ve ever had to raise money."

Rubenstein has said that he was once offered the opportunity to meet Mark Zuckerberg (and invest in Facebook) before Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard but decided against it, and this is his single greatest investment regret. Rubenstein also said that he turned down a 20% stake in Amazon during the very early years of the company. He told Amazon founder Jeff Bezos that if he got lucky and everything worked out he would at most be worth $300 million.

In 2018, he formed Declaration Capital, a family office focused on venture, growth, real estate, and family-owned businesses.


### Books

In October 2019, Rubenstein's first book was published. Called *The American Story: Interviews with Master Historians* (Simon & Schuster), the book features interviews with historians talking about their areas of historical expertise. Among others, Rubenstein interviews David McCullough on John Adams, Jon Meacham on Thomas Jefferson, Ron Chernow on Alexander Hamilton, and Walter Isaacson on Benjamin Franklin.

His second book, *How to Lead*, was published by Simon & Schuster in September 2020. This book contains Rubenstein's reflections on leadership as well as 30 interviews with business, government, military, sports and cultural leaders. In September 2021, Simon and Schuster published Rubenstein's third book, *The American Experiment*, which describes how America's government and democratic ideals have evolved over the centuries as told through the lives of Americans who have embodied the American dream.

In September 2022, he published his fourth book under Simon and Schuster, *How to Invest,* where he shares insights from interviews with investors.
