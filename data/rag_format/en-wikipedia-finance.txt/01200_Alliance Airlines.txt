# Alliance Airlines



**Alliance Airlines Pty Limited** is an Australian airline based at Brisbane Airport in Brisbane, Queensland, with operational bases in Adelaide, Cairns, Perth, Townsville, Darwin, and Rockhampton. Alliance Airlines owns and operates a fleet of Fokker and Embraer jet aircraft: Fokker 70, Fokker 100 and Embraer 190. Alliance runs fly-in fly-out (FIFO) air charter services for the Australian mining and resources industry, as well as private aircraft charters throughout Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and South East Asia. Alliance also provides aircraft component sales and leasing worldwide.


## History

Alliance Airlines was established in 2002 when Brisbane based *Queensland Airline Holdings* acquired the AOC (Air Operator's Certificate) and assets of the dormant Flight West Airlines, which had been established in May 1987 and ceased scheduled services in 2001. Alliance commenced operations with two Fokker 100 aircraft and has since expanded its fleet and operational capabilities to service the growing demand from the mining and energy sector. It is a subsidiary of Alliance Aviation Services that was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2011 and now has approximately 920 full-time equivalent employees.

Alliance was recognised as the first aircraft operator in Australia to attain Flight Safety Foundation Basic Aviation Risk Standard (BARS) Gold Status in 2013

In November 2015, Alliance announced the purchase of 6 Fokker 70 and 15 Fokker 100 aircraft from Austrian Airlines. In 2016, the airline was recognised as the first regional aircraft operator in Australia to attain IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certification. In November 2018, Alliance was awarded CAPA Asia Pacific Regional Airline of the Year.

In February 2019, Qantas acquired a 19.9% shareholding.

In August 2020, Alliance announced a deal to purchase 14 Embraer E190 jets adding to their current fleet and then in December 2020 ordered a further 16 more Embraer E190 jets bringing their total to 30. The first E190, named *Brazilian Lad* was received by the airline on 29 October 2020 at Brisbane Airport and was expected to enter service in February 2021.

In May 2022, Alliance announced it had agreed terms to be taken over by Qantas. The deal was subject to regulatory and shareholder approval and in April 2023, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission opposed the takeover, and it was subsequently abandoned by both companies.

On 27 February 2023, Alliance announced it would purchase an additional 30 E190s from Aercap for delivery between September 2023 and January 2026, most if not all of which being ex-jetBlue E-jets. The aircraft will be initially certified and maintained at their new base in Rockhampton, Queensland.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
