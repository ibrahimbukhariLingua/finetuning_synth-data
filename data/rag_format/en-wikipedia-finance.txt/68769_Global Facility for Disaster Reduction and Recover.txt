Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery


# Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery



The **Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)** is a global partnership program established on September 29, 2006, to support developing countries on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The facility is administered by the World Bank and governed by a Consultative Group including the World Bank Group, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and several other international organizations and countries.

GFDRR was initially launched to support the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (HFA) approved during the Second World Conference on Disaster Reduction in 2005. On March 18, 2015, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (Sendai Framework) was adopted. GFDRR now supports the implementation of this framework.
