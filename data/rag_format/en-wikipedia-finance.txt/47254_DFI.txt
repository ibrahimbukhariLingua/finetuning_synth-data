# DFI



**DFI** (**Diamond Flower Inc**) is a Taiwanese industrial computer company with headquarters in Taipei. It designs, develops, manufactures, and sells industrial motherboard, industrial PCs, System-on-Module, industrial displays, and ODM/OEM services.

DFI was founded by Y.C Lu on July 14, 1981, developing and selling electronics components and add-on cards in the beginning. However, DFI switched to the production of motherboards after searching for potential markets and deciding to focus on the strengths of DFI. Targeting the new growing market in motherboard products, DFI announced the Patent License Agreement with Intel Corporation to build partnership with Intel in 1990 and has been developing and manufacturing motherboard products since 1992. With continuous dedication, DFI quickly gained a reputation in Asia-Pacific region after five years and was awarded Top 10 Motherboard Manufacturer in CRN Magazine from the year 1997 to 1999. Starting from 1998, DFI began to follow the strategies of Intel by releasing Intel 440BX series motherboards, 810 motherboards, and 810e motherboards to worldwide markets. Since its growing advances in manufacturing motherboards, DFI was awarded the Intel Global Demo Board manufacturer award in 1998 and 1999 respectively.

Catering to the growing market of high-end motherboards, DFI developed advanced overclocking motherboards, the LanParty series, which has proven to be a valuable segment for small powerful computers that meet the requirements of end users in the 2000s.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ DFI introduced the junior lineup (“JR”) with two products, p45 and 790gx, in the beginning, which has since been extended with Nvidia and X58 chipsets. There are other LanParty series like LT, DK(Dark), and Lanparty UT.

With blossoming business in the market, DFI went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) on January 15, 2000. DFI has already gained a reputation from its motherboard products and hot-selling lineup, LanParty, at that time. And aside from developing LanParty consumer products, DFI started to develop ACP (Application Control Platform) businesses, mainly targeted at vertical applications in slot machine, POS, security system, and so on since 2002. In 2005, DFI gained over 50% revenues from this new business. With this successful transformation, industrial computer became the primary business of DFI. As of 2003, DFI's renowned overclocked gamer motherboard, LANPARTY NFII ULTRA, was awarded the Chief Editor Choice Award in PC Magazine and the Best Creativity Award in Tom's Hardware Guide.

Since DFI planned to focus on developing embedded system products, not only did they stop developing Consumer Product Line, but also started establishing embedded system developments and designs in 2011 to expand its industrial computer business.
