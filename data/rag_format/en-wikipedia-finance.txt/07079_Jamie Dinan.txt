## Early life and education

James Gerard Dinan was born to a Roman Catholic family in 1959 in Baltimore, Maryland, one of five children of Robert and Jeannette Dinan. His father was a textile engineer and his mother a homemaker. In 1969, the family moved to Paxton, Massachusetts. In 1977, Dinan graduated from the private Bancroft School. He then went on to earn a B.S. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics in 1981. While at the University of Pennsylvania, Dinan joined Alpha Chi Rho, a northeastern fraternity. In 1981, he took a job with stock research firm, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ). In 1985, Dinan earned a M.B.A. from Harvard University.


## Investment career

In 1985, he took a job at the merger arbitrage firm Kellner DiLeo & Company. In 1987, the market crashed and he lost his entire $600,000 in savings. In 1991, he was able to raise $3.6 million from his former DLJ colleagues and started his own hedge fund named York Capital (named after the street he was then living on, York Avenue). In 1993, his fund earned credibility with a 33.8 percent return and by 2000, the fund had over $610 million in assets. In 2010, he sold 33% of York to Credit Suisse for $425 million.
