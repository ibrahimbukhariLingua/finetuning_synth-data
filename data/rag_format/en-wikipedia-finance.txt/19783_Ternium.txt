## History

Ternium was formed in 2005 by the consolidation of three companies: Siderar of Argentina, Sidor of Venezuela and Hylsa of Mexico.

In 2006, Ternium was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2007, Ternium acquired Grupo IMSA, expanding its operations into Guatemala and the United States.

In April 2008, after a series of worker disputes over pay which led to strike actions, Sidor was nationalized by the government of Venezuela. In May 2009, compensation of US$1.65 billion was paid for Ternium's 59.7% stake in Sidor.

In August 2010, Ternium acquired a 54% interest in Ferrasa, and in April 2015, Ternium acquired the remainder of the company, which was renamed Ternium Colombia.

In 2017, Ternium acquired CSA Siderúrgica do Atlântico for €1.4 billion and renamed it Ternium Brazil.

In July 2023, Ternium increased its ownership in Usiminas to 51.5%.
