# Georgi Naydenov (businessman)



**Georgi Ivanov Naydenov** (Bulgarian: Георги Иванов Найденов) (born July 19, 1927 – October 3, 1998) was a Bulgarian businessman and banker who was born in the small town of Strelcha, and became famous during the 1960s as the creator of the unique and successful economic experiment Texim.


## The Economic Group

The idea of Texim as an independent organization within the Bulgarian socialist economy originated with a starting capital of 10,000 Leva (1 Dollar at that time was equal to around 1.17 Leva). Yet, although Texim existed for only 8 years from 1962 to 1969, its legendary success has accompanied the name until this day. Eventually, the experiment expanded to comprise three main units: Texim, the Imextracom Establishment, and the Bulgarian Trading Fleet. The Bulgarian Merchant Fleet included trade, shipbuilding, and docks, while Texim included the first Coca-Cola establishments in the entire communist bloc.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
