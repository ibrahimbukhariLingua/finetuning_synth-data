Building Cost Information Service


# Building Cost Information Service



The **Building Cost Information Service** (**BCIS**) provides cost and price data for the UK construction industry. Founded as part of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), it is now a standalone company.


## History

BCIS was set up in 1961 to provide the profession with cost information in elemental format and to promote the use of elements and of elemental cost planning. The BCIS "Standard Form of Cost Analysis" (SFCA) remained an industry staple, largely unchanged, until the late 2000s. In 2012 the "New Rules of Measurement" for cost management throughout the construction process were accompanied by a modernised version of the SFCA.

In 2022, the BCIS was spun out of RICS.

The BCIS approach is the most popular costing method employed by quantity surveyors in the UK.
