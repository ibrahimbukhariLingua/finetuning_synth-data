Love & Money (album)


# Love & Money (album)



***Love & Money*** is the ninth studio album by Georgian-British singer-songwriter Katie Melua. It was released on 24 March 2023 through BMG Rights Management.


## Background

In January 2023, Melua announced the album, "a stunning and personal 10 track glimpse" into the life and journey of the singer-songwriter. It was once again produced by Leo Abrahams, while recording took place in summer 2022 at Real World Studios, owned by Peter Gabriel. Ahead of the news, she announced the *Love & Money* tour through Europe in November 2022.

*Love & Money* received generally positive reviews from music critics. To Matt Collar of AllMusic, it felt like Melua was "happy and wants to mark the occasion", calling the record a "subtle, yet palpable shift" from her previous album (2020). Collar thought that if *Love & Money* represents the sound of Melua "getting carried away", "it seems to suit her just fine".

In a mixed review, Josephine Maria Bayer at *Laut.de* thought it was "inexplicable" how Melua renounced her former "warm band and orchestra sound". According to Bayer, it would have suited Melua better if she had taken a longer creative break, saying that the production on the album cannot "keep up with the brilliance" of her previous works.
