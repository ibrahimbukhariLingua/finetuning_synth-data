## History

JCorp was incorporated as Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Johor (PKENJ) or Johor State Economic Development Corporation (JSEDC) by the Johor State Government under enactment No. 4/1968, which was passed on 18 May 1968 as the principal development institution to drive the growth of the state’s economy. It was later amended in 1995 and renamed to Johor Corporation (Pindaan; Enakmen No. 5/1995).

The corporation was initially funded with a RM10 million loan from the State Government to fund its entry into the plantation business. JCorp has had three significant stages of evolution over the past 50 years.

JCorp 1.0 commenced in 1968 and was mandated to eradicate poverty and to organise society.

The Group transitioned into JCorp 2.0 stage in 1995 to accelerate economic growth. With a net asset value of RM2.2 billion at the time, JCorp was Malaysia's largest SEDC.

In 2020, JCorp 3.0 was initiated to reinvent, reset, reimagine and future-proof its businesses.
