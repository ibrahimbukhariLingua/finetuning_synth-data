Financier (cake)


# Financier (cake)



A **financier** (French pronunciation: [fi.nɑ̃.sje]) (formerly known as a **visitandine**ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ (French pronunciation: [vi.zi.tɑ̃.din])) is a small French almond cake, flavoured with beurre noisette, usually baked in a small mold. Light and moist with a crisp, eggshell-like exterior, the traditional financier also contains egg whites, flour, and powdered sugar. The molds are usually small rectangular loaves similar in size to petits fours.


## History

The financier originates from the French region of Lorraine. Originally made by the Visitandine order of nuns in the 17th century, the financier was popularized in the 19th century.

The name *financier* is said to derive from the traditional rectangular mold, which resembles a bar of gold when the Swiss reinterpreted the *financier* and baked it in this form. Some French bakeries still sell this cake under the name of "visitandine".

According to another tradition, the cake became popular in the financial district of Paris surrounding the Paris stock exchange, as the cake could easily be stored in the pocket for long periods without being damaged.
