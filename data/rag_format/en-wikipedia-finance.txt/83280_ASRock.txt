# ASRock



**ASRock Inc.** (Chinese: 華擎科技股份有限公司; pinyin: *Huáqíng Kējì Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī*) is a Taiwanese manufacturer of motherboards, industrial PCs and home theater PCs (HTPC).

Established in 2002, it is owned by PEGATRON, a company part of the ASUS group.


## History

ASRock was originally spun off from ASUS in 2002 by Ted Hsu (co-founder of the mentioned company), in order to compete with companies like Foxconn for the commodity OEM market. Since then ASRock has also gained momentum in the DIY sector with plans for moving the company upstream beginning in 2007 following a successful IPO on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In 2010 it was acquired by PEGATRON, a company part of the ASUS group.

As of 2011, ASRock is the world's third largest motherboard manufacturer, having cooperated with professional esports player Johnathan Wendel in the development of a gaming-oriented enthusiast motherboard in 2011.

ASRock established itself as a server motherboard affiliate in April 2013, having received orders from 10 mid-size clients for server and industrial PC motherboards and forming partnerships with system integrators.


## Products and services

Besides motherboards, ASRock also sells desktop minicomputers. Three ASRock products were short-listed for the 2012 Taiwan Brand Award for the first time, and then became endorsed products of the External Trade Development Council when they were promoting the quality image of Taiwan brands globally. In 2012, ASRock stepped into the industrial PC and server motherboard market. ASRock began developing graphics cards in partnership with AMD in 2018 as a result of the surge in cryptocurrency mining.
