Councils purchased two shares for $1 each. In 2017, Southern Phone had 35 shareholders including the Upper Lachlan Shire Council, Coffs Harbour City Council and Bellingen Shire Council.

Optus Satellite partnered with Southern Phone in October 2017 to launch the national broadband network (NBN) Sky Muster.
