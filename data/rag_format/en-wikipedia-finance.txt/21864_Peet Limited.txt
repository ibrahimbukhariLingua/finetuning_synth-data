**Peet Limited** (ASX: PPC) is an Australian real estate development company focused on creating masterplanned residential communities and medium density and apartment developments for homebuyers across Australia.

Headquartered in Perth, it has operations in all Mainland Australia states and territories.


## History

Peet was founded in 1895 as Peet & Bastow by James Peet. James Peet was a surveyor and draughtsman who left England for Australia in 1888. After a short time in Queensland, he moved to Victoria where he established a real estate partnership with architect Austin Bastow in Melbourne. In the early 1890s Peet and Bastow turned their attention west, and in 1895 James Peet moved to Western Australia and established Peet & Company Ltd.³

In the late 1990s Peet and Co bought its first property in Victoria. In 2002, the company continued its eastern expansion buying its first property in Queensland. In 2004, Peet purchased its first piece of land in New South Wales and in August of that year listed on the Australian Securities Exchange later in the same year.

In 2006, the company changed its name from Peet & Co to Peet Limited.

In 2015, Peet Limited finalised the full acquisition of property group CIC Australia which expanded the company's reach to all mainland Australian states and territories.⁵
