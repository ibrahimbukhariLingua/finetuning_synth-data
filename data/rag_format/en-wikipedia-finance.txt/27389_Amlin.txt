# Amlin



**MS Amlin Ltd** is an insurer operating in the Lloyd's, UK, Continental Europe and Bermudian markets. Specialising in providing insurance cover to commercial enterprises and reinsurance protection to other insurance companies around the world, MS Amlin's shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group in February 2016.


## History

The company was formed on 28 September 1998 through the merger of Angerstein Underwriting Trust and Murray Lawrence Group syndicate (the name was derived by combining 'A' from Angerstein, 'ML' from Murray Lawrence Group and 'IN' from Insurance). However, the oldest part of the business (K J Coles Syndicate) dates back to 1903. In 2008 it bought Anglo French Underwriters and subsequently renamed it as Amlin France in 2010. In July 2009 it acquired Fortis Corporate Insurance for €350m only to be renamed Amlin Corporate Insurance.

On 8 September 2015, it was announced that Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group had agreed to buy the firm for £3.5bn. The acquisition was completed in February 2016.

MS Amlin was fined £9.7 million by the Prudential Regulation Authority for risk management failures in September 2022.
