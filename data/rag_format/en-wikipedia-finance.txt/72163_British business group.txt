British business group


# British business group



**A British Business Group (BBG)** is an association or club of expatriate British business people. The aims of the group are typically to encourage trade with the host country and to provide a social environment for business networking. Typically a BBG will organize trade missions, lectures and social functions. Many BBGs fulfill a charitable role, although that is not a primary function.

BBGs are often closely associated with the local British consulate or embassy, and with related organizations, such as the Middle East Association or the UKTI.
