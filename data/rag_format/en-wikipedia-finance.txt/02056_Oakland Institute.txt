# Oakland Institute



The **Oakland Institute** is a progressive think tank founded in 2004 by Anuradha Mittal. It is headquartered in Oakland, California.


## Mission and areas of focus

Since 2011, the Institute has investigated land investment deals in developing countries, particularly where there are questions about transparency, fairness, and accountability.

The Oakland Institute's mission is to "increase public participation and promote fair debate on critical social, economic, and environmental issues in both national and international forums". The institute works in coalitions and networks to strengthen social movements, especially in partnership with grassroots constituencies such as faith-based organizations, farm workers, immigrant rights groups, black farmers, and international proponents of food sovereignty and trade justice.

The Oakland Institute categorizes its work into the following program areas:

* Climate change
* Foreign investment
* High food price crisis
* International aid
* Land rights
* Poverty
* Sustainable food systems
* Trade agreements

## Activities

In 2011, the institute detailed a $26 million investment made by Vanderbilt University in Emergent Asset Management, later known as EMVest Asset Management, a hedge fund accused of abusive practices in sub-Saharan countries including Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The episode was covered internationally and led to student protests on campus in 2012.


## Controversies

In 2021, the Oakland Institute was involved in a watchdog complaint to the IRS that alleged self-dealing by Mittal, who is also the vice president of Ben & Jerry's non-profit foundation. In 2017 and 2018, Ben & Jerry's foundation paid $104,000 to the Oakland Institute, where Mittal is the only salaried employee; during this time, the Oakland Institute paid Mittal a salary of $156,000.
