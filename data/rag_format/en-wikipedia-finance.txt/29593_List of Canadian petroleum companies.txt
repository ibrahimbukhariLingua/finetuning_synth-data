Although there are numerous oil companies operating in Canada, as of 2009, the majority of production, refining and marketing was done by fewer than 20 of them. According to the 2013 edition of Forbes Global 2000, canoils.com and any other list that emphasizes market capitalization and revenue when sizing up companies, as of March 31, 2014 these are the largest Canada-based oil and gas companies (they are either based entirely in Canada or majority Canadian owned).

As of 2009, Syncrude and Irving Oil were leaders in the Canadian industry, with Syncrude being the top producer of oil sands crude and Irving Oil operating the largest oil refinery in the country.

Canadian oil company profits quickly recovered following the 2008 financial crisis; In 2009 they were down 90% but in 2010 they reached $8.4 billion. The price gap between West Texas Intermediate oil ($85/bbl) and Western Canadian Select heavy crude ($65/bbl) with the price of upgraded synthetic oil surpassing WTI when supply falls (before being upgraded to synthetic crude, heavier oil produces fewer barrels of oil per metric ton than lighter oil). As of 2011, there were 2,412 oil and gas companies based in Calgary, Alberta alone.

According to a University of Calgary petroleum geologist, most oil sands companies in 2011 were still using 1980s recovery process technologies. With the price of oil at USD $100, there was no incentive for companies to invest in research and innovation to be profitable. By 2001, the first commercial steam-assisted gravity drainage facility was started, and by 2011, there was more oil extracted from the oil sands using in situ steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) than traditional bitumen strip mining extraction with its massive trucks, tailings ponds. By 2005, the petroleum industry in Canada began a major shift as oil producers renewed an interest in research and development projects to improve bitumen extraction technology and processing methods. From 2005 to 2010, ten oil and gas companies—including Suncor, Imperial Oil, Nexen, Calfrac and Laricina Energy Ltd.—increased the number of patent applications for new technologies to increase the amount of bitumen that can be recovered. According to the industry, in 2011, only 10% of the 1.6 trillion barrels (250 km³) of crude buried in the oil sands, could be recovered with the 1980s technologies.

Canadian oil and gas companies with a market cap were included in the 2009 Forbes 500 list. In 2011, The Globe and Mail included eight oil and gas companies in their ranking of Canada's 1000 most profitable public companies. By 2013, Suncor and CNRL—Canada's two largest petroleum companies were also among top eleven of the country's most valuable companies.

In 2011, Canadian Natural Resources, overtook Suncor to become Canada's largest producer. Suncor produced 549,000 boe/d in 2012 only slightly higher than in 2011. In 2010, Canadian Natural Resources produced at a gross rate of 655,000 boe/d up from 600,000 boe/d the year before.

## Husky Energy

Revenue 18.261 bn MV 23.648 bn (2011)

Husky Energy was founded in Wyoming by Albertan Glenn Nielson who with 2 partners, bought 2 heavy oil refineries, and used them to establish the Husky Refining Co. in 1938. This was followed by major purchases of oil rich land and gas stations. In 1946 Nielson moved part of the company to Canada where Husky Oil Ltd. was created separate from the parent company. By the late 1970s the company's need for more funding eventually forced Nielson to sell all his stake in the company. Another Albertan, Bob Blair CEO of the pipeline company AGTL (later renamed Nova Corp.) took advantage of the situation gradually increasing his stake in the company until he owned a controlling interest. About a decade later Husky ran into financial problems that were solved when Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing started investing in the company leading to a buy out of Blair's interests in 1991. The 1988 acquisition of Centerra Energy Ltd. made Husky a top 10 Canadian oil company. After a turbulent couple decades, Husky reasserted itself as a major Canadian petroleum company in 2000 by purchasing Renaissance Energy Ltd. in a $3.02 billion deal.

Husky Energy has proven petroleum reserves of 430,000,000 barrels (68,000,000 m³) and 2 trillion cubic feet (5.7×10¹⁰ m³) of natural gas. It owns approximately 500 filling stations in Canada as well as property and/or mineral rights to some 6.67 million acres (27,000 km²) in Western Canada.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Husky's oil production was exactly the same in 2011 as it was in 2003 (312,500 boe/d).


## Enbridge

Revenue 15.539 bn MV 21.664 bn (2011)

Began as a pipeline company called interprovincial pipelines incorporated by Imperial Oil in the 1940s as a result of growth at the Leduc oil fields in Alberta exceeding the capacity of Alberta's refineries to process the oil. In 1950 its pipelines were operational and in 1953 it was a publicly traded company at stock exchanges in Toronto and Montreal. By the late 1950s its main pipeline was almost 2,000 miles (3,200 km) long handling about 200,000 barrels (32,000 m³) of oil per day in certain sections.
In the late 1960s refineries in the US and Canada demanded more oil be delivered from Canadian sources, and the solution deemed best by management, and government officials was to build a new line through Chicago. The access expansion gave the company to Chicago helped the company grow rapidly and by the early 1970s throughput reached 900,000 barrels (140,000 m³) of oil. By 1986 Imperial Oil's ownership of the company was down to 33% and through an exchange of shares Imperial Oil helped interprovincial acquire another oil company called Hiram Walker while subsequently changing its name to Interhome Energy Inc. Later it was renamed IPL Energy Inc. During the 1990s it acquired a number of other companies (consumers gas, altagas, interest in Chicap pipeline) which delivered natural gas as well but most of the company's business was still in crude oil. The new divisions gave the company greater access to Toronto, Quebec and New York. Its last name change made in 1998 was to Enbridge Inc. a combination of the words energy and bridge.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Currently Enbridge owns the world's longest oil pipeline system (delivers 2,000,000 barrels (320,000 m³) per day), owns Canada's largest natural gas distributing company, and has 1.9 million customers. It is also active in the alternative energy sector, having an interest in wind farms, waste heat recovery plants and photovoltaic projects the largest of which is the Sarnia Solar Project.

Revenue comes from commodity sales (79%), gas distribution sales (6.9%), transportation and other services (14.0%).


## Cenovus Energy

Revenue 13.621 bn MV 25.049 bn (2011)
Cenovus Energy Inc. is the former component of Encana that focused more on integrated oil than natural gas though natural gas continues to contribute about half of total production (exceeded oil (crude and synthetic combined) as recently as the end of 2009 however a steady fall in output combined with new oil sands production has reduced that).

Cenovus Energy owns a 50% interest in two major US refineries operated by Phillips 66, which can act as a natural hedge for the company as commodity prices fluctuate.


## Talisman Energy

In 2011 and 2012 Talisman sold off some of its largest assets including 50% of British operations; that resulted in revenue loss ($8.347b in 2011 to $7.312b in 2012).

Originally BP Canada, Talisman Energy is a publicly traded Tsx 60 petroleum company that operates in Canada, USA, Columbia, Scotland, Peru, Algeria, Tunisia, UK, Norway, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, and Qatar.

* 420,000 barrels (67,000 m³) of oil per day production.

## Nexen

Revenue 5.840 bn MV 11.986 bn (2011)

In February 2013 Nexen was taken over by Cnooc in a $15.1 billion deal. At the time, Nexen's 2.5 billion boe reserves would've ranked 8th among Canada's oil companies.

When Nexen was created in 1971 it was a subsidiary of the American company Occidental Petroleum called Canadian Occidental Petroleum. After taking over a number of smaller companies in Canada while increasing their international holdings they became larger and more independent of their parent company that by then held only a minor stake. In 2001 the name was changed to nexen in recognition of that.
In 2012 the company profited $333 million on revenues of $6.7 billion which is down since 2008 (US$8–9 billion, market value of US$11.14 billion, and a profit of US$1.68 billion). On November 29, 2011 Nexen sold 40% of its Horn River, Cordova and Liard basins shale-gas assets in northeast B.C. to Inpex Corp and JGC Corp of Japanese for US$676 million.
At the Long Lake project oil is upgraded by a process known as steam assisted gravity drainage.

Operates in Canada, Yemen, Colombia, West Africa and the UK (offshore).

* Market cap peaked in 2008 at between US$20 and 24 billion (at the time it was reported that oil major Total was prepared to offer US$19.7 billion for the company) but has since fluctuated between $US10 and $US14 billion

In February 2011 the Usan offshore oil field began producing. It has a capacity of 180,000 barrels per day and Nexen holds a 20% interest in it.

* production : 207,000 barrels (32,900 m³) of oil/day in 2011 16% lower than the year before. Production net of royalties was 186,000 boe/d.

## Syncrude

* Based on the price paid for a 9% share by Sinopec the company could be worth as much as $US50 billion.
* Syncrude is the world's largest producer of oil sands crude.
* Opened in 1978 and started expanding in 1996
* is a joint venture involving 4 Canadian companies (80.97% owned), 3 American(19.93% owned), and 1 Japanese.
* #1 single source of oil in Canada

## Irving Oil
