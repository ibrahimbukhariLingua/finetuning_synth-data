# Guillaume Cerutti



**Guillaume Cerutti** (born 20 March 1966) is a French business executive and former senior civil servant. He is the chairman of Christie's auction house since 2023. In 2025 succeeded François Pinault as president of the Pinault Collection.

He was managing director of the Centre Georges Pompidou from 1996 and 2001. From 2002 to 2004, he served as chief of staff for the French Minister of Culture Jean-Jacques Aillagon, and afterwards worked in France’s Finance Ministry. He was the chief executive officer of Sotheby's France from 2007 to 2011 and deputy chairman of Sotheby's Europe until 2015, and CEO of Christie's from 2017 to 2025.


## Early life and career

Guillaume Cerutti was born on 20 March 1966 in La Ciotat, France. He studied in Paris, attending the Institut d’Études Politiques and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration. Early in his career he held a number of administrative positions. He was the managing director of the Centre Georges Pompidou from 1996 until 2001, overseeing the renovation of the Musée National d'Art Moderne.

From 2002 to 2004, he was the chief of staff for the French Minister of Culture Jean-Jacques Aillagon. After Aillagon's tenure, Cerutti took a role in the French Ministry of Economy and Finance, serving as head of the executive office for consumerism and competition from 2008 until 2011.


## Career in the private sector

Cerutti was named president-director of Sotheby's France in September 2007, after being recommended to the auction house by Jean-Jacques Aillagon. He became vice president for Sotheby's Europe in 2011, and by 2015, he was both deputy chairman of Sotheby’s Europe and CEO of Sotheby’s France. Sotheby's achieved the highest art sales on the French market during his tenure, particularly with the help of several French art collections sold in Paris, London and New York.

In August 2015, *Les Echos* reported that he would become president of Christie's for London, Continental Europe, the Middle East, India, and Russia (Christie’s EMERI), taking the post in 2016 after a non-compete clause expired. He was subsequently named CEO of Christie's on January 1, 2017, succeeding Patricia Barbizet. Upon becoming CEO, Cerutti implemented a restructuring. One of his first actions was closing Christie's lower-value outlet in South Kensington and scaling back Christie's operations in Amsterdam. He redirected funds to newer facilities in Asia and Los Angeles.

After becoming Christie's CEO, he oversaw a number of auctions for high-profile collections, several of which broke world price records. In 2017, he oversaw the sale of Leonardo da Vinci's *Salvator Mundi* at Christie's New York for $450.3 million, breaking the price record for artwork sold at auction. In late 2022, he oversaw Christie's auction of Paul Allen's art collection the Paul G. Allen Collection, which sold for $1.6 billion that November, making it the biggest sale in world auction history. In 2021, Cerutti oversaw the sale of Beeple's *Everydays: the First 5000 Days*, Christie's first NFT auction. After overseeing the sale of other NFTs through Christie's, including several Cryptopunks, the *Wall Street Journal* reported in July 2023 that he remained "bullish on NFTs" and their value.

Cerutti became chairman of Christie's in 2023. He stepped down as CEO in February 2025 and transitioned to oversee a broader range of responsibilities within the Pinault family's art-related projects, becoming the president of the Pinault Collection.


## Board and organizations
