## Background

The origins of HT-Tech can be traced to Yonghong Appliance Factory (Factory 749) a state-owned enterprise established in 1969 in Qin'an County to produce integrated circuits. After the Chinese economic reform, it relocated to Tianshui City in 1994. At this point the factory was in financial distress due to lack of competitiveness and had not paid its employees in months. Long-term factory employee Xiao Shengli was appointed as the factory's director and worked towards reforming it. The factory underwent a significant restructuring with many employees being laid off including Xiao's own family members. In 1998, the factory made a profit after many years of losses.

In December 2003, the factory was transformed into a company named HT-Tech.

On 20 November 2007, HT-Tech held its initial public offering becoming a listed company on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

In 2019 HT-Tech acquired Flipchip, an American OSAT company based in Phoenix, Arizona.
