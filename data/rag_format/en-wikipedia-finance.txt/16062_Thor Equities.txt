## Background

Thor Equities was founded in 1986 by President & CEO Joseph J. Sitt. His first investment was a property sold at tax auction on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, a chronically under served retail area, where he built a one-story retail structure with money from family and friends. He proceeded to secure national retailers Rite Aid Pharmacy and Payless Shoes after convincing them of the value of this location.


## Ashley Stewart

From Sitt's early realization of the retail gap that left broad swathes of inner city consumers largely underserved by major retailers, he founded Ashley Stewart (a name inspired by Laura Ashley and Martha Stewart) in 1991. Ashley Stewart sold modern and fashionable clothing to women.

Each Ashley Stewart store hired from within the community, and the company was recognized by President Clinton for its contribution to the Welfare-to-work program. Ashley Stewart quickly grew to over 380 stores in more than 100 cities, which prompted many national retailers to follow suit and helped change the urban retail landscape. Sitt was also part owner of the Children's Place kids clothing chain as well as Marianne Stores, a retail outlet specializing in clothing for Latina women.

As business boomed, Sitt sold his interest in 2000 to concentrate on urban real estate through his company Thor Equities.

In 2004, Sitt was profiled by Crains New York in its annual "40 Under 40" issue, which celebrates those individuals in New York City who have achieved success in business before turning 40.

Thor's London assets also include 145 Oxford Street, 105-109 Oxford Street, 1 Dover Street, and Bond Street House at 14 Clifford Street.

### Manhattan

Thor is a major retail property owner on New York's Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue. Sitt has been seen as one of the market makers on Fifth Avenue, helping push retail growth further below the traditional southern border at 49th Street.

Thor has also made significant investments in the Meatpacking District, betting on the area to continue its climb as a premier retail destination in Manhattan, driven in part by the High Line and arrival of the new Whitney Museum.

Thor is also heavily active in New York's SoHo area and owns numerous properties in the district. In 2013, Sitt partnered with several investors to purchase 529 Broadway for $150 million. In March 2015, the company leased its entire 15,000-square-foot building at 155 Mercer Street in SoHo to Dolce & Gabbana for the brand's flagship retail store.

Later in 2005, Thor announced plans to build the first tower at the site also known as City Point. The building was to be the tallest tower in Brooklyn. After the city changed its zoning to permit development of the site, Thor sold the site and development plan for $125 million to a financial company.


### Coney Island

In 2006, Thor announced plans for a $1.5 billion Las Vegas-style amusement park resort, which required several zoning changes. The city had a competing vision for Coney Island and attempted to buy Thor's land, but Thor did not accept the city's offer. Astroland ceased operations on September 7, 2008. Interim amusement rides and a flea market opened in the summer of 2009 and closed later that year.

On November 11, 2009, Sitt reached a deal with New York City to sell part of his 12.5 acres (51,000 m2) of land in Coney Island for $95.6 million so that the city and Thor could jointly redevelop Coney Island, completing the three-year negotiation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In May 2015, Thor Equities unveiled Coney Art Walls, a public art wall project curated by former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Jeffrey Deitch and Thor CEO Joseph Sitt. Located at 3050 Stillwell Avenue, the project featured established and new artists. Coney Art Walls returned in 2016 with 21 new murals.

In 2025, Coney Island based community organizations including Coney Island USA and the Coney Island History Project opposed the casino development proposed by Thor Equities for Coney Island.
