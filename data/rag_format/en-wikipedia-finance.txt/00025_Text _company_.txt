## History and Milestones

Founded in 2002 as LiveChat Sp. z o.o. (LLC) in Wrocław, Poland, the company initially focused on live chat solutions for businesses. In October 2007, it transitioned into a stock company.

In October 2006, 50% of the company stock was bought by Capital Partners S.A., an investment and consulting firm publicly listed at the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In February 2008 Capital Partners S.A. decided to follow its strategy of having fewer companies but larger individual transactions and sold its entire stake along with another 13% of company stock to another publicly listed company, Gadu-Gadu S.A. This way LiveChat Software became another Polish company in Naspers capital group, joining Gadu-Gadu and Allegro.pl.

In January 2011, the management team sought to get back a controlling equity stake in the company and started a management buyout. After Naspers agreed in June 2011 to sell its entire stake, the founders teamed up with private equity firm Tar Heel Capital to finalize the buyout of the 60% stake. After the transaction was completed in September 2011, the founders own 60% of the stake, while Tar Heel Capital owns 40% of the company.

LiveChat Software has been introduced to the Warsaw Stock Exchange in April 2014 with the symbol LVC.

In 2023, the company has changed its name from “LiveChat Software” to “Text” to reflect its expanded product offering and broadened focus on artificial intelligence and e-commerce. Today, it operates offices in Wrocław and Boston, Massachusetts, serving a global customer base.
