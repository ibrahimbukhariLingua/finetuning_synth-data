## Critical reception

Joey Akan of *Pulse Nigeria* reviewed P-Square's "Bank Alert" as a neo-highlife song that sticks to their familiar formula of singing about wealth and romance but offers no renewed energy or artistic growth following their publicized reconciliation. He concluded, "You need to hear this—just because it’s Psquare. Any other thing you expect to hear is not present". Chidi Chima of *TheCable* reviewed "Bank Alert" by P-Square, noting that while the song brought back familiar melodies reminiscent of "Iyogogo", it still felt refreshing and addictive. Chima observed that Paul dominated the singing and that, despite a decline in originality, "Bank Alert" would likely become popular. He concluded, "while Psquare has improved on its infusion of sounds, the twin brothers have declined in originality." Wilfred Okiche of *360nobs* described "Bank Alert" as a typical offering from the duo, following their usual formula of flaunting wealth with an upbeat, radio-friendly sound. Despite lacking reinvention, Okiche concluded, "P-Square is back alright and, it is just like they never left."
