Bpifrance


# Bpifrance



**Bpifrance** also known as the ***Banque publique d'investissement*** (lit. '[French] Public Investment Bank') is a French public sector investment bank. It is a joint venture of two state owned enterprises: the Caisse des dépôts et consignations and EPIC BPI-Groupe (formerly EPIC OSEO).

The former subsidiary of EPIC OSEO, OSEO S.A., became a subsidiary of Bpifrance known as Bpifrance Financement.

Bpifrance has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.
