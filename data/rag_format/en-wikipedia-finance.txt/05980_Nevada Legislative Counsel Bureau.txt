Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau


# Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau



The **Nevada Legislative Council Bureau** is a Nevada state agency that provides legislative service, such as legal advice, fiscal information, and background research, for other Nevada state agencies or other U.S. governmental organizations. The agency is headed by an executive director, and the position is currently occupied by Diane Thornton (acting director). The Nevada Legislative Council Bureau is headquartered in Carson City, Nevada, and maintains an additional presence in Las Vegas, Nevada.


## History

The earliest form of the Nevada Legislative Council Bureau existed in 1963, with the creation of a legislative counsel. Since its founding, the agency is meant to be non-partisan and provides legislative service for any government staff who requires it. During this same year, the audit and fiscal division are still considered the same division, and the administrative division had yet to be created. In 1975, the audit division was separated from the fiscal division, but the latter did not become a separate division and was instead merged into the research division.


## Structure

Parts of the Nevada Legislative Council Bureau are the Legislative Committee and the Interim Finance Commission. The Legislative Commission consists of 12 members, while the Interim Finance Commission members are the Senate Committee on Finance and the Assembly Committee on Ways and Means from the preceding session.

The executive director of the agency reports to both boards. There are five divisions of the Nevada Legislative Council Bureau, which are the following:

1. Administrative Division
2. Audit Division
3. Fiscal Division
4. Legal Division
5. Research Division
