## History

In 1864, textile industrialist Jean Jenny-Ryffel formed Switzerland's first consumer cooperative in Schwanden in the canton of Glarus. Over the next years, many other cooperative societies emerged in the country. In 1890, many of them joined together to form the *Verband Schweizerischer Konsumvereine (VSK)* (French: *Union suisse des sociétés de consommation (USC)*). In 1969, it was renamed to its current name, *Coop Genossenschaft* (French: *Coop société coopérative*; Italian: *Coop società cooperativa*).

In 1927, the Verband Schweizerischer Konsumvereine and the Swiss Federation of Trade Unions founded the *Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank* (French: *Banque Centrale Coopérative*; Italian: *Banca Centrale Cooperativa*). It became a shares company in 1970, and in 1995 was renamed **Bank Coop** (*Banque Coop*; *Banca Coop*). In 1999, the Basler Kantonalbank became the majority shareholder. On May 19, 2017, the institution undertook a comprehensive rebranding and became the **Bank Cler** (*Banque Cler*; *Banca Cler*).


## Passabene (self-checkout)

Coop was one of the first self-checkout providers in Switzerland, introducing its own system called Passabene in 2005. It is in use in 80 stores. Coop uses the MC17T Retail Mobile Computer by Motorola Solutions for this application. They later introduced mobile apps that customers can use to scan items.


## Cargo Sous Terrain

Cargo Sous Terrain (CST) is a planned underground logistics system – its first phase in the Mittelland region is scheduled by the early 2030s. As of January 2016, the company's respective association (*Förderverein Cargo sous terrain*) was based at the seat of Coop (*Genossenschaft Basel*) in Basel.


## Swissmill

*Swissmill* operates the largest granary in Switzerland that produces 800 tons of grain daily, representing 30% of the national grain requirements. Its flour is prepared for all bread products produced by the Swiss retailers Coop, Volg, and Landi. Although the Swissmill Tower's exterior and height in Zürich is disputed, the municipal authorities claim that *the silo is intentionally designed in its aesthetically conscious way. Its external appearance is intended to express its interior – an industrial plant*.
