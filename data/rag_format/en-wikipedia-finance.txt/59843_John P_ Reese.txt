## Early life and education

John P. Reese was born on July 1, 1953, in Los Angeles, California. He attended Hollywood High School in Hollywood, California, before going to MIT and Harvard Business School.

Reese attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering in 1974. At MIT, he was a member of the school’s artificial intelligence laboratory. In 1979, he received his Master’s in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.


## Career

Prior to his investing career, Reese served as marketing manager of electronics at Coleco and vice president of information technology for GE Capital ITS. He also founded and served as CEO of Micro Networks of America, a Farmington, Conn.-based computer networking firm, before selling the company to AmeriData Inc. in 1993.

Reese founded The Reese Group in the late 1990s. Initially, the site served as a report card for financial commentators, monitoring how well the recommendations of dozens of investment columnists and personalities fared. The company's name was later changed to Validea.com. The firm's focus was also changed to feature Reese's stock-selection models. As of April 2011, Validea.com featured models based on published books or papers from 11 different investors with long-term track records of generating above-market-average returns and quantifiable investment strategies. Those investors include: Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, William O'Neil, Warren Buffett, David Dreman, Martin Zweig, Kenneth Fisher, James O'Shaughnessy, John Neff, Joseph Piotroski, and The Motley Fool. Reese is the chief executive officer of Validea.com.

In 2004, Reese co-founded Validea Capital Management where he became the CEO, and which manages money for high-net-worth individuals and institutions using his computer models. In 2014 Reese became the co-portfolio-manager of an actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched by Validea Capital. The fund was the first to directly give investors exposure to the methodologies used by some of Wall Street’s successful investors.
