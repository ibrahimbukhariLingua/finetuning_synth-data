## History

Taxware was founded by Dan Sullivan in 1979 as **Audio Visual Products** (AVP). In 1980 they released their first product, Sales Tax Rate File. AVP changed its name to Taxware, Int’l in 1996 and in 2000 was purchased by First Data Corporation. In 2003, Taxware acquired TaxSolver from ATX and in 2006, First Data Corps sold Taxware to Automatic Data Processing (ADP).

In December 2012 Taxware was acquired by Vista Equity Partners. As part of the acquisition, Taxware relocated its headquarters from Salem, NH to Ballardvale Office Park in Wilmington, MA.
