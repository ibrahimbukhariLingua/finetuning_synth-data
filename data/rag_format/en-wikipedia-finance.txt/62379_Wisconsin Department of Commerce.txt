Wisconsin Department of Commerce


# Wisconsin Department of Commerce



The **Wisconsin Department of Commerce** was a department in the executive branch of the Government of Wisconsin. It was established as the **Wisconsin Department of Development** in 1979, renamed to the Department of Commerce in 1995, and abolished in 2011. The department was responsible for implementing and overseeing the economic development programs for Wisconsin through consultation, technical assistance, and relocation assistance. It also administered the distribution of federal economic assistance programs to local governments and businesses, and acts as a go-between for businesses and other government agencies. The department also enforced laws regarding safety and sanitation in buildings, petroleum products, and petroleum tanks. It also gave housing assistance to low income families.

The Department of Commerce was administered by the Wisconsin Secretary of Commerce, who was appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Wisconsin Senate.


## History

The Department of Commerce traced its roots to the Division of Industrial Development which was originated within the Office of the Governor, as established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1955. It was renamed the Division of Economic Development in 1959, and was assigned at that time to the Wisconsin Department of Resource Development. In 1965, the division was returned to the Office of the Governor. Two years later, in the executive branch reorganization of 1967, it became part of the Department of Local Affairs and Development, where it absorbed local and regional planning functions.

In 1971, the division was promoted to a department, when the Legislature created the Department of Business Development. The department then absorbed the division of tourism from the Department of Natural Resources in 1975. In 1979, the Department of Business Development was combined with the Department of Local Affairs and Development to form the Department of Development, which was renamed the Department of Commerce in 1995.

In 2011, the Wisconsin Legislature voted to abolish the Department of Commerce. Its core economic development functions were transferred to the new Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. Other functions, such as those promoting building safety and certain professional licensing, were transferred to a new Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services.

The Department of Commerce ceased operations on July 1, 2011.
