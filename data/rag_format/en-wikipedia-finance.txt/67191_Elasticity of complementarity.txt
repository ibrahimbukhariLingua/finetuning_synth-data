Elasticity of complementarity


# Elasticity of complementarity



**Elasticity of complementarity** (Hamermesh, 1993) is the percentage responsiveness of relative factor prices to a 1 percent change in relative inputs.


## Mathematical definition

Given the production function {\displaystyle f(x\_{1},x\_{2})} then the elasticity of complementarity is defined as

The inverse of elasticity of complementarity is elasticity of substitution.
