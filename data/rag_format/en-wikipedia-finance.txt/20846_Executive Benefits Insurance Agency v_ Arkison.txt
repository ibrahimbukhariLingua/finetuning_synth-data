Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison


# Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison



***Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison***, 573 U.S. 25 (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that, under *Stern v. Marshall*, when a bankruptcy court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a proceeding, the bankruptcy court may still hear the case and issue proposed findings to be reviewed de novo by a federal district court.


## Significance

Because bankruptcy courts in the United States are organized as Article I tribunals rather than as Article III courts, they are not permitted to exercise the judicial power of the United States. *Stern v. Marshall* identified so-called "*Stern* claims" that required exercising the judicial power and were therefore beyond the authority of bankruptcy courts. *Stern* was very disruptive in the sense that, technically, it was not precisely clear what bankruptcy courts could and could not hear for lack of jurisdiction. This case established that bankruptcy courts could continue to hear their cases as before, so long as the *Stern* claims were later heard by an Article III court with appropriate jurisdiction.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
