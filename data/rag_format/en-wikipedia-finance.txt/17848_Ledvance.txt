Ledvance


# Ledvance



**Ledvance GmbH**, headquartered in Garching bei München, Germany, is a general lighting and smart home technology company. It was established in 2016 as a spin-off from Osram Licht AG. Since April 2018, Ledvance has been wholly owned by Chinese lighting company MLS.

The company generated revenue of €1.35 billion in 2023 and is active in over 140 countries.


## History

In April 2015, it was announced that Osram would divest its general lighting lamp business, which accounted for just over one-third of its workforce. In June 2015, the supervisory board of Osram Licht AG agreed to the divestment of their lamp division with products such as LED lamps, halogen lamps, and compact fluorescent lamps. This divested division has been operating as a legally independent company under the name Ledvance since April 2016. The company is permitted continued use of the brand names Sylvania throughout the United States and Canada, and Osram in Europe.

At the end of July 2016, Osram announced that Ledvance would be sold for more than €500 million to a Chinese consortium consisting of investor IDG Capital, LED packaging manufacturer MLS, and Yiwu. The sale was completed on 3 March 2017, with economic effect as of 1 March 2017. Due to the takeover, MLS gained distribution networks in Europe and the United States. Since April 2018, MLS has been the sole owner of Ledvance.

In the course of the takeover and the subsequent reorganization, some former Osram sites were closed and Ledvance shifted its operations and distribution strategy.

In 2023, Ledvance opened a training facility in Westfield, Massachusetts. In September 2024, Ledvance and Osram announced that they would extend their brand licensing partnership for general lighting lamps for the next decade.
