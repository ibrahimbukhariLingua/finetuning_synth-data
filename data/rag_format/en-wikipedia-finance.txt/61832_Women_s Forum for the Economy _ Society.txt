### Daring Circles

Daring Circles are workgroups that build on existing research compiled by the Women's Forum. They draw on the collaborative expertise of its partners to reveal innovative views and insights, and generate positive societal and economic outcomes.

Each program consists of a combination of strategic members, global partners, knowledge partners sourcing content, and institutional partners with relevant policy influence and expertise. The Daring Circles aim to generate evidence-based insights and drive tangible action among members and beyond.

The Women's Forum launched Daring Circles five key areas:


#### Women & Climate

* Led by AXA, which addresses gender gaps, and ensures women lead in health technology.

#### Women & AI

* Led by BNP Paribas and L’Oréal, which enables women to lead actions against climate change, and addresses its disproportionate impact on women.

### Women & STEM

* Led by Microsoft, which inspires organizations to apply a gender-lens to their AI development and implementation.

#### Women & Access to Health

* Led by Google, which promotes the increase in representation, leadership, and impact of women with STEM skills.

#### Women & Business

* Led by P&G, which raises awareness of the power of procurement for women's economic empowerment, and promotes women-owned businesses.

#### The report "Women at the Heart of the Economy"

After the G7 hosted and chaired by France in Biarritz in August 2019, Ms. Chiara Corazza, managing director of the Women's Forum, was commissioned by Ms. Marlène Schiappa, French Government Minister of State for Gender Equality and the Fight against Discrimination, and by Mr. Cédric O, French Government Minister of State for the Digital Sector, to provide critical policy proposals and a national action plan to foster the attractiveness of STEM skills for girls and women throughout their lives.

Thanks to the tremendous support from all the partners of the Women's Forum, Corazza proposed 27 recommendations, outlined in the report "Women at the Heart of the Economy" and designed to enable women to be where they can have a positive and decisive social and economic impact in order to bring their added value to a rapidly changing world.

These proposals will contribute to the law for women's economic empowerment that the French Government is submitting in 2020.


## Rising Talents

The Rising Talents program aims to distinguish highly talented young women who will become influential figures in our economies and societies in the future. In partnership with Eurazeo, Spencer Stuart and Lazard, the initiative is an example of the values championed by the Women's Forum since its creation. The Rising Talents network includes more than 100 members and offers networking opportunities year-round. Having celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2017, this initiative brings the vision of these change-makers to the Women's Forum. Each year, some 15 young women join the Rising Talents network and attend the Women's Forum Global Meeting and regional Women's Forum meetings, benefiting from enhanced networking activities during these events and in the future.


## CEO Champions

CEO Champions is an initiative launched in 2010 by the Women's Forum, designed to drive progress and accountability for women's advancement in the private and public sectors. In partnership with McKinsey & Company, the peer-to-peer network presents an opportunity for CEOs to underscore their organization's commitment to women's advancement as well as take a strong leadership role in the broader global economy and society. CEO Champions members are participants who track and drive measurable progress for women's advancement through on-record mutual commitments and accountability. Now in its ninth year, the CEO Champions Initiative is a pioneer as a high-level international platform that advocates for the inclusion of both men and women at leadership level in the private as well as the public sector. In 2018, the Women's Forum gathered over 150 CEOs at CEO Champions workshops, organized in partnership with McKinsey & Company, in Canada, Singapore, and France.
