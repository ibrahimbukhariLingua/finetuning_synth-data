Kane-bugyō


# Kane-bugyō



***Kane-bugyō*** (金奉行) were officials of the Tokugawa shogunate with responsibility for financial accounting or tax administration.

The manner of paying taxes varied according to locality. In the *Kantō,* payments were generally made in rice for wet fields and in gold for uplands. In the *Kinai* and western provinces, a slightly different formula was applied; but the payments were also received in both rice and gold. In the case of cash payments, the money would have been taken to Edo Castle or to Osaka Castle where it became the responsibility of *kane-bugyō*.

The *kane-bugyō* in Edo and Osaka were responsible for all accounts associated with such receipts of cash. These were compiled and then subsequently audited by the *katte-kata*. The entire operation was closely scrutinized by a member of the *rōjū* or the *wakadoshiyori*.

Some domains also had the position of *kane-bugyō*. Two of the Forty-seven rōnin had held this position in the Akō Domain: Ōtaka Gengo and Maehara Isuke.
