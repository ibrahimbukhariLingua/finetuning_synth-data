Editis


# Editis



**Editis** is a French group of publishing companies, subsidiary of Czech Media Invest. It is the second-largest French publishing group, after Hachette Livre.

In June 2023, after acquiring a majority stake in Hachette's parent company, the Lagardère Group, Vivendi chose to keep Hachette, while selling Editis to Czech Media Invest, which is owned by Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský. The sale was finalised in November 2023.


## History

Editis was created in January 2004 by the regrouping of approximately 60% of the publishing assets of Vivendi, the other part remaining with Lagardère Group.

Editis was, for 4 years (until May 2008), part of Wendel, a financial investment group which had acquired it from Investima10 (a financial *ad hoc* structure holding Vivendi Universal Publishing assets after Lagardère's purchase in 2003). Wendel purchased this group of publishers for about €400 million plus debt, and sold it to Planeta for about €960 million, realising a profit.

In May 2008, Editis integrated with the Planeta Group, the main Spanish-speaking publisher. In January 2019, Vivendi reacquired Editis from Planeta for €900m.

In November 2023, Czech Media Invest acquired Editis from Vivendi for €653m. The total amount of funds received by Vivendi was €654 million including the reimbursement of Editis's debt to Vivendi at closing.
