Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation


# Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation



The **Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation** is a charitable foundation whose aims are to promote Finnish research in economics and medicine and to maintain and support educational and research facilities in Finland. It was established in 1954 by the wife of Yrjö Jahnsson, Hilma Jahnsson. It supports the award of the Yrjö Jahnsson Award and Yrjö Jahnsson Lecture series. These lectures have been delivered by noteworthy economists since 1963. 10 of the Yrjö Jahnsson Lecture series scholars have gone on to win the Nobel prize in economics, making it a top predictor for future recipients.

## Yrjö Jahnsson Award

The **Yrjö Jahnsson Award** is a biennial award given by the Finnish Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation to European economists under the age of 45 "who have made a contribution in theoretical and applied research that is significant to the study of economics in Europe." The selection committee, chaired by the president of the EEA, consists of five members, four nominated by the European Economic Association (EEA) and one by the Yrjö Jahnsson Foundation. The selection committee consults all EEA fellows individually and uses their responses together with their own judgment to form a short list.
