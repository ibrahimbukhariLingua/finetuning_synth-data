The SFC is responsible for fostering an orderly securities and futures markets, to protect investors and to help promote Hong Kong as an international financial centre and a key financial market in China. Even though it is considered to be a branch of the government, it is run independently under the authorisation of the laws relating to Securities and Futures.

## History

The SFC was created in 1989 in response to the stock market crash of 1987.

In 1997 following the Asian financial crisis, the regulatory framework was further improved.

A comprehensive Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) was implemented in 2003, which expanded the SFC's regulatory functions and powers.

Andrew Sheng served as chairman of the SFC from 1998 until 2005, when he was succeeded by Martin Wheatley. Wheatley first served as chairman, and became CEO in 2006 when the posts of chairman and CEO were segregated to further promote corporate governance. Eddy Fong was appointed non-executive chairman in 2006. Ashley Alder assumed the position of CEO in 2011 and Carlson Tong was appointed non-executive chairman in 2012. In late 2022, Julia Leung was named as chief executive officer of the SFC.


## Responsibilities

The SFC is one of four regulatory organisations that make up financial regulators in Hong Kong, one of the major financial centres in the world. The others are the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority. The SFC is responsible for securities and futures markets including the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the seventh largest stock exchange in the world (See list of stock exchanges).

The SFC has a responsibility to maintain order and protect investors, it does this by carrying out the following tasks:

## Structure

The SFC is an independent statutory body whose powers derive from the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) legislation.

The SFC is made up of a board whose members are appointed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong for a fixed term, a majority of which must be independent Non-Executive Directors. The board is headed by the chairman also appointed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

An executive committee led by a chief executive officer (CEO) reports to the board and the board chairman and he runs the agency on a day-to-day basis; this position was created in 2006.

Its delegated by the SFC and conducted by the Hong Kong Securities Institute.


### Criticisms

In addition to that, no formal appeal procedures or practices are in place to check and balances the legitimacy of such examinations. Discrepancies between different languages are commonplace with these examinations.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Cryptocurrencies

Criticized for its response to JPEX, the SFC in September 2023 said that it would not publish a list of businesses applying for cryptocurrency licenses; a week later, the SFC backtracked and said it would publish it.

In October 2024, the SFC began preliminary work on setting up a licensing program for over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading and custody services. A McKinsey report from 2024 predicts that tokenized assets like mutual funds and ETFs could reach a value of $1.1 trillion by 2030 due to blockchain adoption.
