## History

Founded in 1993 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Absolute developed a product to manage, track and secure computers regardless of the physical location of devices. In 2000, Absolute became a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).

In 2005, Persistence technology by Absolute was embedded for the first time into the firmware or BIOS of a computer. This was the start of an ongoing partnership with most major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) where Absolute technology ships with the hardware from the factory.

In 2007, Microsoft awarded Absolute gold certified partner status in the Microsoft Partner Ecosystem.

Absolute's office in Europe was first established in November 2006, in Newbury, UK. In July 2009, a second regional office was opened in Austin, Texas, to serve as a base for Absolute's U.S.-based sales team.

In December 2009, Absolute announced its acquisition of the LANrev product suite, a computer systems management software application, from Pole Position Software. Following the acquisition, the product suite was rebranded as Absolute Asset Management, and eventually renamed as Absolute Manage.

In November 2012, Absolute acquired the assets of LiveTime Software, a privately held helpdesk and IT Service Support Management (ITSSM) provider. LiveTime assets were officially relaunched as part of Absolute's expanded product suite in January 2013 as Absolute Service, an IT Service Management (ITSM) tool. Absolute Service received PinkVERIFY ITIL 3 Certification from Pink Elephant.

In June 2013, Absolute acquired Palisade Systems, a privately-held provider of data loss prevention (DLP) technologies. In October, the firm launched a student and device protection initiative called Absolute Safe Schools, which educates students and staff of participating schools on the safe use of mobile devices and provides assistance in the event of device loss and theft.

In December 2013, John Livingston stepped down as chief executive officer and as a member of the board of directors at Absolute. On June 13, 2014, Geoff Haydon was appointed CEO and director .

Absolute renamed Computrace to Data and Device Security (DDS) and refocused its business model in 2015. The company sold its Absolute Manage and Absolute Service products to HEAT Software in October 2015.

On November 2, 2018, Christy Wyatt was appointed CEO and director. She was named “New CEO of the Year” by the Globe and Mail in 2020. Business and technology news organizations have interviewed Wyatt on cyber security topics including ransomware, the zero trust security model, and the trend toward remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2023, Absolute Software announced it would be acquired by Crosspoint Capital Partners for $657 million. The acquisition was completed in July 2023, and the company (ticker symbol ABST) delisted from both the TSX and NASDAQ exchanges.

In September 2024, Absolute announced the acquisition of Syxsense, an endpoint and vulnerability management provider based in Costa Mesa, CA.


## Products and services

The Absolute software platform, formerly known as Data and Device Security (embedded into firmware of most computers, tablets, and smartphones at the factory), consists of several components organized into three product lines: Secure Endpoint, Secure Access, and Application Persistence-as-a-Service.

The Secure Endpoint line enables users to monitor and address laptop problems. Its components include Absolute Visibility, Absolute Control, and Absolute Resilience. The company added Absolute Ransomware Response in April 2022.

The Secure Access line provides network connectivity for users to gain access to resources in the cloud, private data centers, or on-premises. These products allow users to transition to a zero trust approach. The line includes Absolute VPN, Absolute ZTNA, and Absolute Insights for Network.

In November 2021, Absolute launched the Application Persistence-as-a-Service (APaaS) product line.

A core component of all three lines is Absolute Persistence, which allows always-on connection to the endpoint. Furthermore, the products' "self-healing" client can reinstall itself if tampered with. Persistence technology is embedded in more than half a billion devices.


## Partnerships

Absolute has partnerships with various (OEMs) worldwide, embedding its Persistence technology directly into device firmware during production. Notable OEM partners include Dell, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard, and Samsung. Dell, an early customer of Absolute, later became a supplier. Kevin Peesker, President of Dell Canada, noted that Dell's scalable infrastructure has supported Absolute's global growth and operational efficiency from its Vancouver base.

Absolute has partnerships with resellers, distributors, and regional partners, including companies such as CDW, PCM, Insight, and InTechnology.
