List of pharmaceutical companies


# List of pharmaceutical companies



This listing is limited to those independent companies and subsidiaries notable enough to have their own articles in Wikipedia. Both going concerns and defunct firms are included, as well as firms that were part of the pharmaceutical industry at some time in their existence, provided they were engaged in the production of human (as opposed to veterinary) therapeutics. Included here are companies engaged not only in pharmaceutical development, but also supply chain management and device development, including compounding pharmacies.

Firms with no marketed products but which are working on pharmaceutical development as well as mature firms with a post-marketed portfolios have been included here.

Types of firms not include here include

* Retail pharmacies
* Intellectual property holding firms
* Firms specialized in the collection, fractionation and distribution of human blood
* Medical device manufacturers where the device is not related to pharmaceutical administration, including diagnostics only firms
* Ayurvedic, homeopathic, traditional Chinese medicinal, herbal supplement (e.g. *unani* in Bangladesh and Pakistan) and firms only involved in cannibis-product manufacturers
* Contract Research, Contract Manufacturing and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CROs, CMOs and CDMOs)

Entry titles have been shortened in a number of cases, so that if the article title of a company is "XYZ Pharma", for instance, the entry will appear here as "XYZ".

Companies which existed as a joint venture for their entire existence are indicated by a super-script "JV", as in PerseidJV.
