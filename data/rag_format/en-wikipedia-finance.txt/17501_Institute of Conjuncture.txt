Institute of Conjuncture


# Institute of Conjuncture



**The Institute of Conjuncture** was founded in Moscow in 1920 by Nikolai Kondratiev as a center for the study of business cycles. As its first director, Kondratiev managed to develop the institute, from just a couple of scientists at its beginning, into an institution with 51 researchers in 1923. In 1928, the Institute was dissolved after the New Economic Policy was replaced with a planned economy.


## History

The Institute was organized in October 1920 by Nikolai Kondratiev following his arrival in Moscow following a brief stint in jail. It was at the Institute of Conjuncture that Kondratiev drew up his Five Year Plan for Agriculture. In the 1920s, the Institute of Conjuncture circulated the *Economic Bulletin of the Conjuncture Institute* which includied an index of retail prices, economic indicators, and theoretical articles. Though the institute had few researchers at formation, by 1923 it had become a respected institution with fifty-one researchers associated with it. With the collapse of the NEP and the transition to a planned economy, the Institute closed in 1928.

From the middle of 1927, the head of the Market Research Institute was subjected to harsh political accusations. In April 1928, N. Kondratiev was removed from the post of head of the institute, and a little later, he was fired from Narkomfin. On May 8, by decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR, the institute was ordered to be transferred from the People's Commissariat of Finance to the Central Statistical Directorate. Attempts to challenge the decision had no effect.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

After the transfer of July 14, 1928, 42 people went to work in the CSD. P. I. Popov became the director of the Institute. The most important research activities of the institute stopped, since they were impossible outside the Narkomfin. The Institute was liquidated in January 1930 after the transformation of the Central Statistical Administration into the management of the Gosplan.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
