Taiwan External Trade Development Council


# Taiwan External Trade Development Council



The **Taiwan External Trade Development Council** (**TAITRA**; Chinese: 中華民國對外貿易發展協會; pinyin: *Zhōnghuá Mínguó Duìwài Màoyì Fāzhǎn Xiéhuì*) is a non-profit government co-sponsored trade promotion organization in Taiwan. It was founded in 1970 as **China External Trade Development Council** (**CETRA**), but changed its English name in January 2004 to avoid confusion with bodies representing the People's Republic of China.

TAITRA assists Taiwan businesses and manufacturers to reinforce their international competitiveness and to cope with the challenges they face in foreign markets. Cooperating with Far East Trade Services, Inc. (FETS) and the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC), its sister organizations, TAITRA has striven to adapt its trade promotion strategies to the changing international conditions. Its major functions include: Market Research & Information Service, Market Development, Exhibition & Convention Service, Trade Education and Web Service.
