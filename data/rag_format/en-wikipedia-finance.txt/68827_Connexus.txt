## History

Connexus was founded by Greg Holloway in 1989 when he established a network of bulletin boards (BBS). BBS's were the original means of online communication prior to the modern-day internet. Connexus was one of Australia's first ISPs. Over the forthcoming years, Connexus expanded to four phone lines and the user base grew to over 1,000. In 1998 Connexus established local facilities in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and the Gold Coast (Service, 2012). In 2003, Connexus diversified its internet offering to supply business broadband for small to medium-sized businesses. In 2012, Connexus was acquired by MNF Group and relaunched in 2019 as a telecommunications provider targeted at small businesses.
