## History


### As CBS Digital Media and CBS Interactive

The company was founded in 2005 as CBS Digital Media. In 2007, CBS Digital Media rebranded as CBS Interactive. On May 30, 2007, CBS Interactive acquired Last.fm for Â£140 million (US$280 million). On June 30, 2008, CNET Networks was acquired by CBS and the assets were merged into CBS Interactive, including Metacritic, GameSpot, TV.com, and Movietome.

On March 15, 2012, it was announced that CBS Interactive acquired video game-based website Giant Bomb and comic book-based website Comic Vine from Whiskey Media, who sold off their other remaining websites to BermanBraun. This occasion marked the return of video game journalist Jeff Gerstmann to the CBS Interactive division of video game websites, which includes GameSpot and GameFAQs, and has Gerstmann once again working directly with some of his former peers at GameSpot within the same building at the CBS Interactive headquarters.

On April 17, 2012, it was announced that Major League Gaming and CBS Interactive would be entering a partnership alongside Twitch to be the only exclusive online broadcaster of their Pro Circuit competitions, as well as for advertising representation.


### CBS Corp./Viacom re-merger and afterwards

After the divestment of the "CNET Media Group", CBS Interactive was dissolved after an organizational restructuring and renamed **ViacomCBS Streaming** in order to accelerate ViacomCBS 'direct-to-consumer streaming strategies.
