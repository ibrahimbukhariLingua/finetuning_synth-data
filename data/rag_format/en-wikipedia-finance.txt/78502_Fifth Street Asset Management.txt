## History

The Fifth Street entities were founded by Leonard M. Tannenbaum in 1998.

Fifth Street Asset Management owned two publicly traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corporation and Fifth Street Floating Rate Corporation. Fifth Street Finance Corporation was founded in 1998 and launched its IPO in 2008 and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corporation was established in 2013.

In 2014, Fifth Street Finance partnered with the Kemper Corporation on two joint ventures, which allow lenders to take on and re-distribute more debt, for $200 million in equity commitments and $400 million in leverage. Other firms that have entered into these agreements include Solar Capital and THL Credit. Fifth Street Asset Management also has two senior loan funds on its books.

In the summer of 2014 they made decisions that caused their investors to lose their investment value. In July 2014 they issued new shares to grow their balance sheet, but set these shares at a new price and that, after fees, diluted the wealth of existing shareholders. In August 2014 Fifth Street Floating Rate Corp a business development company, managed by the same manager as Fifth Street Finance Corp. issued millions of new shares at a price of $12.14, a 20% discount to the previously reported net asset value per share of $15.13. This led to shareholders losing millions of dollars.

In October 2014, Fifth Street Asset Management completed its initial public offering and is currently listed on the NASDAQ(NASDAQ: FSAM). The company had initially withdrawn its initial public offering, only to then amend it on October 28 and reduce the initial offering by 50 percent. Originally, the company planned to issue 8 million shares at between $24 and $26 per share. Company shares declined 21 percent to $13.37 on its first day of trading after opening at $17 per share.

Total revenues increased by 4.6%, or $1.1 million, to $24.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, as compared to $23.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. The growth in total revenues was driven by a 22.4% increase in year-over-year fee-earning AUM. Management fees (which include base management fees and Part I fees) for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 were $23.6 million, or 94.8% of total revenues.

On July 14, 2017, Oaktree Capital Management announced it would assume management of Fifth Street's two business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corp and Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp. Oaktree renamed the two funds Oaktree Specialty Lending Corp and Oaktree Strategic Income Corp, respectively. The transaction closed on October 17, 2017.
