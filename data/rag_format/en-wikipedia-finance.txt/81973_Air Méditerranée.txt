Air Méditerranée


# Air Méditerranée



**Air Méditerranée** was a French charter airline headquartered on the property of the Tarbes–Lourdes–Pyrénées Airport in Juillan. It operated chartered passenger and cargo flights, mostly to and from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.


## History

Air Méditerranée was established and started operations in 1997 and had its headquarters in Le Fauga, near Toulouse. In January 2015, the airline filed for receivership. By January 2016, there had been offers by potential investors to secure new funds for the struggling airline with no final decision made by the authorities.

The only incident of the airline occurred in February 2016 where a man urinated on a passenger over not being allowed to smoke on the flight. However, the victim fought back by punching the man in the face. The flight was diverted to Lyon, where both passengers were arrested.

On 15 February 2016 the airline was liquidated by the courts after amassing debts of €60m and all aircraft were returned to their lessors.
