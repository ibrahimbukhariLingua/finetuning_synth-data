# Innovid



**Innovid** is an American online advertising technology company that offers services used by advertisers and publishers for the distribution and management of digital ads. Originally launched as a video marketing platform, the company expanded its offering to include display and digital out-of-home when Herolens was acquired in 2019.


## History

Innovid was founded in 2007 by Zvika Netter, Tal Chalozin, and Zack Zigdon. Prior to starting Innovid, Netter and Chalozin co-founded the tech hub and nonprofit organization GarageGeeks where high-profile tech personalities from around the world came to speak about innovation, including Sergey Brin, Craig Mundie, and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales.

In 2008, Innovid raised $3 million from Genesis Partners in a Series A round.

As of 2015, the company had raised $52.6 million in six rounds of funding from investors including Genesis Partners, NewSpring Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, Cisco Investments, and Sequoia Capital.

In November 2017, the company announced a deal to acquire Taykey, a Tel Aviv-based company focusing on real-time, automatic ad targeting software.

In January 2019, Innovid secured $30 million in pre-IPO funding from Goldman Sachs to further its interests in the connected TV sector.

In September 2019, Innovid acquired the display advertising software company Herolens, based in Latin America. Herolens continued to operate its Buenos Aires office, which became the headquarters for Innovid's Latin American business.

In February 2022, Innovid announced that it would acquire TVSquared for $160 million.
