## History

LEI – originally the Landbouw Economisch Instituut (Agricultural Economics Institute) – was established in the late 1930s by agricultural organisations. In the 1970s it became part of the Dutch ministry of Agriculture and in the 1990s it was privatised.
LEI now forms part of Wageningen University and Research Centre, within which it combines with the Department of Social Sciences to form the Social Sciences Group.
