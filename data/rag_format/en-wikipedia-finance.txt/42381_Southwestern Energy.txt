## Controversies


### Public opposition to hydraulic fracturing in New Brunswick, Canada

In 2003, shale gas was discovered in New Brunswick, Canada. The company received exclusive licenses from the Department of Energy and Resource Development to conduct an exploration program. However, after protests by local citizens, in 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, and in May 2016, the government announced that the moratorium would continue indefinitely.
