## Former Investments


### High Ridge Brands

High Ridge Brands is the owner of Coast, Zest, Vo5, Rave, White Rain (2012-2021), L. A. Looks, Salon Graphix, Thicker Fuller Hair, Zero Frizz hair products and Dr. Fresh, Firefly, Reach oral health products and Binaca breath freshening products.

In June 2016, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice acquired a controlling stake in High Ridge Brands.


### DeMet's Candy Company

In 2003, Brynwood bought Pretzel Flipz, a line of yogurt-covered pretzels made in Mohnton, Pa., from Nestlé.

In 2007, Brynwood bought the "Turtles" brand from Nestle USA Inc., acquiring at the same time the 280,000-square-foot (26,000 m²) Turtles production facility in Toronto, Canada — merging the acquisition with a company it owned at the time, Signature Snacks Company.

Subsequently, Brynwood consolidated its portfolio of confectionery acquisitions, which included Stixx, Pretzel Flipz, Treasures, and Turtles, resurrecting the dormant DeMet's Candy Company name. DeMet's started in 1898 as a candy store business and soda fountain shop by George DeMet of Chicago — subsequently creating Turtles candies. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, DeMet’s was purchased by Nestlé in 1988. In 2007, Signature Snacks, then owned by Brynwood, acquired the DeMet’s brand from Nestlé. Former Nestlé USA executive Hendrik Hartong III is chairman of the company. In 2013, Brynwood sold the company to Yıldız Holding.


### Stella D'Oro

In 2006, Brynwood bought Stella D'Oro Biscuit Co. from Kraft Foods. On August 4, 2008, workers of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union went on strike citing proposed pay and benefit cuts and later picketed the company's attempt to bring in replacement workers.

After more than 11 months on strike, the company was required by a court ruling to reinstate the workers. However, shortly thereafter, the company announced in July 2009 that it would close the Kingsbridge, Bronx facility. In September 2009, Brynwood announced the sale of Stella D'Oro to Lance Inc., a large manufacturer of snack foods, which intended to relocate Stella D'Oro's production to a non-union facility in Ashland, Ohio.

Brynwood received negative attention for its role in the work stoppage and sale of Stella d'Oro, including a reference in an op-ed piece by the AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka, published in *The Wall Street Journal* in April 2010.
