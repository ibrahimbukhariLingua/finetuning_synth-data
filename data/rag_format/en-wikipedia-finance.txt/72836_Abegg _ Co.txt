## History

In 1885, Carl Abegg-Arter (1836-1912) and his son Carl Abegg-Stockar (1860-1943), formed *Abegg & Co* as successor company to *Rübel & Abegg* which was a partnership in silk trading started in 1881. The company soon held the various interests and activities of the family and in 1955 was established as corporation and single family office. In 1984, the Müller family (*UHAG Übersee-Handel AG*, respectively *COSA Commerce Outre-Mer SA)*, married into the Abegg family.
