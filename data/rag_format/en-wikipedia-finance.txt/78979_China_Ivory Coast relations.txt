## Chinese development finance to Cote D'Ivoire

From 2000 to 2011, there are approximately 34 Chinese official development finance projects identified in Côte d'Ivoire through various media reports. These projects range from a $114 million loan from Export-Import Bank of China at two-percent interest over 20 years to finance a motorway construction project linking Abidjan to Grand-Bassam, to an 18 million EUR debt relief in 2007.

According to Xavier Aurégan, PhD at the French Institute of Geopolitics, from 1983 to 2013, there are approximately 174 Chinese official development finance projects in Côte d'Ivoire.
Of these 174 official development finance projects, 112 are approximately 12 billion euros. The most expensive project is the urban center in Abidjan (8.9 billion euros).
In addition, infrastructure accounted for 86% of the Chinese public assistance.
The majority of Chinese aid is granted during the Ivorian political crisis between 2002 and 2010. Under Laurent Gbagbo, 69% of aid is thus assigned.

In Abidjan, Chinese nationals are about 2500. They mainly occur in the trade, Adjamé, or restoration, Cocody. They created about 100 companies.
