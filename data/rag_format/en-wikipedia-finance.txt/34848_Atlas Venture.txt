## History

Originally formed in 1980 in Amsterdam as a subsidiary of NMB Bank, now part of ING Group, Atlas historically invested in both life sciences and information technology startup companies. In October 2014, Atlas announced its shift to a biotech-only venture capital firm, with the technology-focused investment team forming a new firm, Accomplice, to continue investing in information technology startups. Previously as a diversified firm, Atlas had raised over $3.0 billion of investor commitments across nine venture capital funds. The firm raised $705 million for its 2000-vintage fifth fund, $600 million for its 2001-vintage sixth fund, $385 million for its 2006-vintage seventh fund, $283 million for its 2009-vintage eighth fund, and $265 million for its 2013-vintage ninth fund. At its largest, the firm held European offices in London, Paris and Munich, and a West Coast office based in Seattle, Washington, in addition to the Boston-area headquarters. Today, the firm operates from a single office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 2015 Atlas raised its first biotech-dedicated fund, Fund X, at $280 million. In 2017, Atlas Venture announced it had raised Fund XI at $350 million in capital to invest in early stage biotech companies in the U.S. and around the world. In January 2019, Atlas Venture announced its Opportunity Fund I raised $250 million. In June 2020, Atlas Venture announced its Fund XII raised $400 million.
