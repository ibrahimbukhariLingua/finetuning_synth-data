## History

During the late 1960s, GE Aerospace personnel developed the first realtime image generator.

In 1991, the group had approximately 37,500 employees, most of whom were located in Florida and the New England and Middle Atlantic regions. The Delaware Valley alone accounted for roughly 17,600 employees.

In 1993, the group was sold to Martin Marietta for over three billion dollars (U.S.), nearly doubling that company's revenue.

In 1995, Martin Marietta merged with Lockheed to form Lockheed Martin.

In 2010, the large Systems Integration ("The SI") division from GE Aerospace, with roots tracing back to the Apollo Program, was spun off to form The SI Organization Inc.
