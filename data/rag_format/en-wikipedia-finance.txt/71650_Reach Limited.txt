Reach, headquartered in Hong Kong, has interests in more than 40 submarine cables (including AJC, APCN2, CUCN, Japan–US, RNAL, SEA-ME-WE 3) and international satellite systems, mainly servicing the Asia Pacific area. Reach has operating licenses and landing rights in most major markets including Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, North America and Europe.


## History

Reach was established as a joint venture between Telstra and PCCW in 2001. Telstra and PCCW injected their international assets, including subsea cables, gateways and satellite capacity into Reach. These assets were supplemented later the same year by the acquisition of Level 3 Communications' Asian assets. After financial difficulties, its shareholders negotiated a debt settlement in June 2004, and it is now financially stable. Reach was restructured, and in 2005 announced that nearly all future expansion would be used for Telstra and PCCW requirements, though it would continue to service its other customers.

In 2011, PCCW transferred the 50% stake of Reach to its subsidiary Hong Kong Telecom (HKT).¹⁵¹ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
