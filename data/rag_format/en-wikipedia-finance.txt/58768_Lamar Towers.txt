## Owners

Drake & Scull International is carrying out the MEP works, with KASKTAS Arabia responsible for the piling, shoring, grouting, soil improvement and dewatering works. The architectural and engineering concept and schematic design for Lamar Towers was undertaken by RMJM Dubai.

The main contract was awarded originally to Arabian Construction Company in October 2008, but it was reportedly subsequently reawarded to Arabtec in May 2009 by developer Cayan Investment & Development, according to Arab News. The structure part of the project was then awarded on 12 October 2010 to the Saudi Lebanese Tarouk Contracting company Ltd who constructed a substantial part of the Project and two towers (up to levels 26, both towers) before being terminated by the Owner on 31 December 2012. The remaining part of the structure and the Project were transferred then in July 2013 to the UAE based general contractor Drake & Scull Construction, part of the Drake & Scull International PJSC group.

Asmo Company (100% owned by Sumou Holding Company) has acquired Sumo Towers (formerly Lamar), one of the leading projects in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with its prime location on the northern Corniche of Jeddah, overlooking the Red Sea. The project has been partially constructed and Asmo aims to complete the construction and development of the project.
