## History

Founded in 2003 by Zia Chishti, TRG originated from back-office operations he had established for Align Technology in Lahore.

TRG obtained the certificate of commencement of business on February 27, 2003. The operations of the company effectively started on April 11, 2003.

In July 2003, TRG was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange following an initial public offering at a strike price of PKR 10. In November 2003, TRG acquired a 40 percent stake in Centratel LLC, a provider of call center and telephone answering services in Bend, Oregon. Previously, it made an investment in Los Angeles–based Alert Communications.

In May 2004, TRG acquired iSKY Inc., a company providing customer care and marketing services to companies in North America and Europe. In June 2004, TRG acquired DCS Inc., a South Dakota–based call center service provider, through its subsidiary Alert Communications, Inc. A year later, in 2005, TRG made a seed investment in Afiniti, a software company developing artificial intelligence for use in customer call centers.

In October 2007, TRG sold its shareholding of Central Voice, LLC to Endicott Communications for $1.75 million.
