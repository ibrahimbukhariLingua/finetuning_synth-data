After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Sudanese Government and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Sudan after 25 years of the Second Sudanese Civil War in southern Sudan, the Central Bank of Sudan Act (Amendment) Act 2006 was issued. There is a dual Sudanese banking system, an Islamic one in the north of Sudan and the other traditional in southern Sudan.
