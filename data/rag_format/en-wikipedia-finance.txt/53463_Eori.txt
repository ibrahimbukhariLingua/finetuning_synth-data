Eori


# Eori



**Eori** is a privately held island, which lies at the extreme northwestern end of the Mamanuca Islands group.


## Geography

It has an area of 9.7 hectares (24 acres) and was advertised as being for lease in April 2008 with a price of â‚¬9,000,000. In 2009 it was offered at auction but failed to sell at a top bid of A$1 million.


## Ownership

Eori was for many years owned by real estate firm Pacific Islands Partnership Limited, which is in turn solely owned by Tim Manning's Chaylor Investments. Chaylor investor Eric Rush held a 7 percent share in Eori specifically.

In 2009, Manning and Chaylor sold the island to investor Graeme Hart., who controls the island through a 100% interest in LLC Eori Island Limited via his personal investment corporation, Rank Group Ltd.
