Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012


# Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012



The **Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012** (c.6) is a UK Act of Parliament that makes important reforms to insurance law.

The Act was a consequence of the Law Commission's millennium review of the law of insurance that has been ongoing since 2006. The review examined insurance in general, and of marine insurance in particular. The new legislation is a response to a consensus that the Marine Insurance Act 1906 is old-fashioned, it no longer represents current practice, and it undermines the continuing dominant position of English Insurance in the global market.

The Act has since been complemented by the Insurance Act 2015; and both of these modern Acts have significantly amended the Marine Insurance Act 1906, particularly in the area of misrepresentation and disclosure.
