# University of Finance and Administration



The **University of Finance and Administration** (Czech: *Vysoká škola finanční a správní o.p.s.*, **VŠFS**) is a private business school in the Czech Republic. It was founded by the Bank Academy and Czech Coal Group in 1999 and was one of the first private business schools in the country. It has had full university status from the accreditation committee of the Czech government since 2009.


## History

In 1998 the Czech government passed a new Tertiary Education Code, 111/1998 Sb., entitling private schools to offer higher education. The University of Finance and Administration was founded the next year.

VSFS expanded in 2001, opening new campuses in Most and Kladno. In 2002 the university entered into cooperation with the City University of Seattle in the United States, and in 2004 joined the Erasmus programme and European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). In 2009 VSFS received state approval of its doctoral program and became a university. Since September 2016, the VSFS has its branch in Karlovy Vary, the building is in the city center, on the T.G. Masaryk Avenue.


## Study programs

In addition to Bachelors and Masters study programmes, and a Doctoral Study Programme (Ph.D.), the university runs study programs for local and regional government bodies, accredited by the Ministry of the Interior.

Thanks to its cooperation with the City University of Seattle, VSFS also runs Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) programs in English. These include MBA programs focused on Global Management, Financial Management or Marketing Management, and a BSBA program offered as a Double Degree, a combination of the Czech and English program.
