# Mark Mateschitz



**Mark Dietrich Mateschitz** (German: [ˈmatεˌʃɪt͡s]; born 7 May 1992) is an Austrian billionaire heir who owns 49% of Red Bull GmbH, the energy drink company that was co-founded by his father, Dietrich Mateschitz.

In 2024, *Forbes* estimated Mateschitz' net worth at $39.6 billion, ranking him as the 31st-richest person in the world.


## Early life and education

Mateschitz was born in May 1992, the only child of Dietrich Mateschitz and Anita Gerhardter. He went to high school in Salzburg, Austria and then studied business administration at Salzburg University of Applied Sciences. During his early life, he kept a low profile and went by his mother's surname; only his middle name, Dietrich, suggested a link to his father.


## Professional life

In 2018, he launched his own drinks company, Thalheimer Heilwasser GmbH, which produces beer and lemonade with water from one of Austria's oldest springs.

When his father died in October 2022, he inherited his father's 49% stake in Red Bull GmbH. He subsequently stepped down as an employee of the company in order to concentrate on his role as a shareholder.

He sits on the board of the Red Bull Wings for Life Foundation, which is run chiefly by his mother Anita Gerhardter.
