Micro enterprise tax in Latvia


# Micro enterprise tax in Latvia



**Micro enterprise tax in Latvia** is special tax regime.

The law, regulating the tax in Latvia, entered into force on the 1st of September 2010. It is named as the *Law on Micro enterprises tax*.


## Aim of the tax

Initially, the tax was introduced with the aim to:

* facilitate the creation of new small businesses,
* reduce bureaucracy and costs associated with starting a business, and
* facilitate the transition of business from the shadow (gray) market to the legal (white) market.

During that time (2009-2011), Latvia was struggling with the crisis, the unemployment rate was relatively high. The introduction of the tax on micro enterprises and other changes in legislation gave opportunity for enterprising people (including the unemployed) relatively simply and at low cost to start a business.

But fairly quickly, many companies began using this regime to reduce their taxes. So Latvian parliament adopted legislation amendments. According to the amendments the application of this tax is very limited. Starting from 2016, application of the tax gradually decreases and from 1 January 2019 enterprises operating in most sectors (industries), will not be able to use the tax regime.
