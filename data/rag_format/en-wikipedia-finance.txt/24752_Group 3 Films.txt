Group 3 Films


# Group 3 Films



**Group 3 Films** was a short lived British film production company that operated from 1951 to 1955.


## Background

It was set up by the National Film Finance Corporation (NFFC) to help finance movies from newer filmmakers. Its films were to be distributed by the Associated British Film DIstributors (ABFD) subsidiary of Associated British Picture Corporation and mostly financed by the NFFC with ABFD to make up the balance of finance. Michael Balcon and James Lawrie sat on the board and the company was run by John Grierson and John Baxter.

They produced over 20 films and lost half a million pounds before the NFFC brought the company to a halt.
