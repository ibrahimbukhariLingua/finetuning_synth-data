Donghae-1 gas field


# Donghae-1 gas field



**Donghae-1 gas field** is located in the East Sea, about 60 kilometers from Ulsan Metropolitan City, South Korea's southern region. It was discovered in 1998 and developed by Korea National Oil Corporation. The natural gas field is operated and owned by Korea National Oil Corporation. The total proven reserves of the Donghae-1 gas field are around 250 billion cubic feet (7.1×10⁹m³), and production is centered on 50 million cubic feet/day (1.4×10⁶m³).

Finally Donghae-1,2 Gas Field was end of Production on December 31, 2021, due to rapid depletion.

## significance

With the development of this gas field, South Korea also joined the ranks of oil-producing countries, and some of the LNG was able to be procured domestically.

Over the 17 years leading up to the end of production on Dec. 31, 2021, it produced 41 million barrels of natural gas(in terms of crude oil) and 3.9 million barrels of Condensate, resulting in an import substitution of about $2.4 billion.

The investment amount is 1.2 trillion won, but the recovery amount is 2.6 trillion won, achieving a 220% recovery rate.
