## History


### 1995–1998

LookSmart was founded as Homebase in 1995 in Melbourne, Australia by husband and wife Evan Thornley and Tracy Ellery, executives of McKinsey & Company. Reader's Digest invested $5 million in the company for an 80% stake. The original concept of Homebase was to build a female and family-friendly web portal to supplement the Reader's Digest magazine. After leadership and strategy changes at Reader's Digest, which reduced RD's focus on its online business, RD wanted to shut down Homebase, which would have cost $4 million in payouts and other termination costs. The founders and former McKinsey's employee Martin Hosking instead proposed a cheaper leveraged buyout of Homebase.

On 28 October 1996, the company launched its LookSmart search engine. At launch, the search engine listed more than 85,000 sites and had a "Java-enhanced" interface. In June 1997, the search engine underwent a major redesign, dropping its original Java-based browsing system.

LookSmart was sold back to the founders as well as Martin Hosking through a leveraged buyout in 1998, with Reader's Digest providing a $1.5 million loan and retaining about a 10% equity stake. Also in 1998, a search box was added to the LookSmart search engine along with People Search, Yellow pages, Discussions and shopping search. In May 1998, the company raised $2.3 million from Amwin and $6.0 million from Cox Media Group and Macquarie Bank and was valued at $23.3 million.
