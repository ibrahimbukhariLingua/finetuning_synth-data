### The Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate Model

MacDonald's research on exchange rate modelling has been highly influential with many implications for policy-markers. The Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER), developed jointly with Peter Clark at the International Monetary Fund, has been widely applied by central banks and financial researchers to assess the extent of mis-alignment between major world currencies.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ the BEER approach has been widely used by central banks, financial institutions and government agencies to determine the so-called Fair Value of currencies and MacDonald was commissioned by the European Commission to apply the BEER approach to advise on the final lockdown Fair Value rates of the Euro Zone currencies. In terms of policy-based research, he has proposed phasing out the Barnett Formula in favour of fiscal autonomy in the Scottish Parliament.
