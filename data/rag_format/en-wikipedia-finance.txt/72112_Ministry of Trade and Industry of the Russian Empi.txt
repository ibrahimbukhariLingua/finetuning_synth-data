## Organization of industrial evacuation during the First World War

In view of the approach of the advancing German troops to the industrialised regions of the empire (Varshava, Riga) in June 1915, the members of the Military–Technical Committee of the All–Russian City Union sent a letter to the Minister of Trade and Industry Vsevolod Shakhovskoy: "It is absolutely inadmissible to continue preserving in such places as Riga, Varshava and the like, large manufacturing enterprises that prepare items of military equipment or are in any way connected with this business. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to urgently take decisive measures to transfer such enterprises to a more favorable environment in the rear".

When Varshava was threatened with capture in July 1915, 50 million rubls were allocated from the treasury for the evacuation of defence enterprises, but only 85 enterprises could be evacuated.

On August 7, 1915, an order was adopted in the Dvinsk Military District to grant factories producing items necessary for "state needs" the right to export factory equipment and materials from the cities of Dvinsk and Vilna to "inner Rossiya". The District Headquarters was responsible for the evacuation.

In Riga, about 500 factories were subject to evacuation. The coordination of the work was entrusted in July 1915 to the head of the Sestroretsk Arms Factory, Major General Anatoliy Zalyubovskiy. The commander of the 5th Army, Pavel Pleve, granted him unlimited powers. Before September 1, 1915, 172 enterprises were evacuated from Riga: to Moskva, Petrograd, Nizhniy Novgorod, as well as to the southern provinces – Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, Donets Basin, where metalworking factories mainly moved.

From other regions, due to unsatisfactory organization of actions, only a few enterprises were evacuated, and some of the evacuees never resumed production.
