## History

Eric Breon, along with attorney Cliff Johnson, co-founded Vacasa in 2009 after experiencing difficulties managing his family vacation home in Long Beach, Washington.

In August 2014, it was named the #9 fastest-growing privately held company in the nation by *Inc. Magazine* in its annual Inc. 5000 list, with an updated three-year growth rate of 16,192%. On November 16, 2016 Vacasa was ranked number 67 out of 500 on the 2016 Technology Fast 500 by Deloitte, which recognizes the fastest-growing technology companies in North America.

In March 2018, Vacasa announced the company would be expanding its Portland office to a newly constructed building in the Pearl District. The 61,000 square foot space provides the company space for an additional 400 employees in Portland.

On October 2, 2018, Vacasa acquired Oasis Collections, which was previously owned in part by Hyatt Hotels Corp.

In 2019, Vacasa acquired Wyndham Vacation Rentals from Wyndham Destinations for $162 million. Vacasa has also partnered with Google to integrate available rental properties into search results for traveling and lodging. It is the first vacation rental management company to do so.

Eric Breon stepped down as CEO of Vacasa on February 11, 2020. Vacasa board member and former OpenTable CEO Matt Roberts replaced Breon as interim chief, and was then named permanent CEO in the summer of 2020.

In July 2021, Vacasa announced that it would become a publicly-traded company through a merger with TPG Pace Solutions, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by TPG Pace Group. The business combination provided Vacasa with an equity valuation of $4.5 billion. Vacasa debuted on the NASDAQ with the completion of the merger on December 7.


## Technology

The company developed the Vacasa Field App to provide its local operations teams with real-time information and updates on home maintenance tickets, as well as its HomeCare Hub, which includes a scheduler algorithm that optimises home clean scheduling across geographic regions.
