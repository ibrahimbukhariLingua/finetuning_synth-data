## History

The credit union was originally founded in the 1930s as the Salt Lake Telephone Employees Credit Union (incorporated June 1936); later becoming known as the Utah Telephone Employees Credit Union (UTELCU). It acquired the Postal Credit Union in 1984, after which it changed its name to Mountain America Credit Union. It merged with the Utah State Credit Union (formerly the Utah State Employees Credit Union) in 1988.

After a 5% tax was proposed on the three largest credit unions in Utah, Mountain America converted from a state chartered to a federally chartered credit union in 2003, becoming Mountain America Federal Credit Union. Mountain America has more than 100 branches, spanning Utah, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico.

In 2023, Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium was renamed Mountain America Stadium, following a naming rights deal between the school and MACU. The 15-year agreement was estimated to be worth more than $50M over the life of the deal. MACU’s naming rights agreement built on its existing support of the school, including owning naming rights to the community ice-plex connected to ASU’s Mullett Arena hockey facility.
