## Career

Between 1996 and 2006, Johnson founded *Bottled Majic Music*, a music company, that bought Rooster Blues.


## Economic analysis

Johnson claims that unemployment and underemployment (idle labour resources) have led to lower tax revenues, which have led to a budget deficit problem for the USA government under George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He also cites the lack of a tax on richer Americans who have inherited wealth at birth or at a young age as another reason for this, in addition to the effects of government bailouts to large capitalist institutions in the years after 2008.


## Personal life

Johnson is married to Alexis McGill Johnson, who is the president of Planned Parenthood.
