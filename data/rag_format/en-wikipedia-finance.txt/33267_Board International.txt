Board International


# Board International



**Board International S.A.** is a business intelligence (BI) and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) software vendor known for its Board toolkit. The company was based in Chiasso, Switzerland, where it was founded in 1994, and Boston, Massachusetts.

Board International now operates in 19 countries, with around 3,000 customers from a variety of industries.


## Products

The firm offers one product, the Board toolkit. It combines various business intelligence (BI) and corporate performance management (CPM) functions within a single graphical software environment. The BI capabilities include multi-dimensional analysis, *ad hoc* querying, dashboarding and reporting, while the CPM capabilities include budgeting, planning and forecasting as well as "other finance-related activities." It does not require any programming skills to build applications.


### Technology

As of version 7, the toolkit featured a service-oriented architecture that relied heavily on Microsoft technology, especially the .NET Framework with its Windows Communication Foundation. This allowed for a tight integration with other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office, but required Windows in order to run the full client, a limitation which has been identified by Gartner as a possible factor for preventing a deeper market penetration.

In 2012, the company introduced an update of its proprietary multidimensional database. This new technology was labelled as *HBMP (Hybrid Bitwise Memory Pattern)*. It introduced a new compression method and combines disk-based and in-memory database approaches. It supports both relational and multidimensional data models.


## Offices

The firm has a total of twenty-seven offices spread across five continents and nineteen countries, with headquarters in Chiasso, Switzerland, and Boston, USA. The company opened three new offices in 2011 (China, Japan and Mexico). Board has fourteen offices in Europe, three offices in Australia, five in Asia, four in North America, and one in South America.
