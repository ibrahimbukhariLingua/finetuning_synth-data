## CMI'S history

CMI's history begins with a small store located in San Cristóbal, Totonicapán, Guatemala in 1920.

In 1936, *"**Molino Excelsior"*** was established in Quetzaltenango by Juan Bautista Gutiérrez, starting the Corporation's milling industry.

In 1964, the Villalobos Poultry Farm was established, and was the starting point for CMI's poultry operations in Guatemala. Seven years later, *"**Pollo Campero**"* was born, a company that today is a major part of the Central America Restaurant Business Unit. A year later, the Corporation began expanding its poultry and restaurant operations to El Salvador and the rest of Central America. In this same decade, the social branch of Corporación Multi Inversiones, the **Juan Bautista Gutiérrez Foundation**, was created.

In 1988, CMI began its operations in **construction**, with the development of real estate and housing projects, shopping centers and office complexes in several areas of Guatemala. 6 years after construction operations began, the *"Pollo Campero"* franchise program was launched. In this same decade, the Finance Business Unit was created to meet the financing needs of the Corporation's companies. 6 years later, the expansion to Central America and the Dominican Republic continued with poultry and milling operations.

The Corporation contributes to its CSR objectives through its business units in two business sectors: CMI Food and CMI Capital, by promoting various projects, consistent with the company's comprehensive and full-sustainability vision.
