## Founding and early years

The First Women's Bank of New York City was conceived as part of a broader movement to address the financial needs of women, who traditional banks often underserved. The idea for the bank was initiated by a group of prominent feminists, including Eileen Preiss, vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, and Betty Friedan, a leading figure in the women's liberation movement. Their announcement to establish the First Women's Bank and Trust Company was made in early 1973, following more than a year of planning and effort to secure regulatory approval. Organizers proposed to capitalize the bank through the sale of $4 million in stock. Madeline McWhinney Dale, an officer from the Federal Reserve Bank, was recruited to be the bank's president underscoring its commitment to advancing women's roles within the financial sector. The bank was located in space formerly occupied by a restaurant in the Ritz Tower Hotel located at 111 East 57th Street.
