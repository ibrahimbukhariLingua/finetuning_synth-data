# National CineMedia



**National CineMedia, Inc.** (**NCM**) is an American cinema advertising company. NCM displays ads to U.S. consumers in movie theaters, online and through mobile technology. NCM presents cinema advertising across a digital in-theater network, consisting of theaters owned by AMC Theatres, Cinemark Theatres, Regal Cinemas and other regional theater circuits.

The publicly-traded National CineMedia, Inc. owns 48.8% and is the managing partner of NCM. Regal's parent company Cineworld and Cinemark and hold the remainder of NCM shares. In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with NCM for US$375 million. The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters. In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.

The company is perhaps best known to the general public for its advertising pre-show, *Noovie*.

On April 11, 2023, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.


## FirstLook

*FirstLook* (2006–2017) was NCM's pre-feature programming. ***FirstLook*** consisted of pre-show advertising and entertainment, provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System interspersed with advertising. The program was approximately 20 minutes, and was timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers.

*FirstLook* was the successor to Regal's ***The 2wenty*** preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. *FirstLook* carried largely that same format, the main difference being that while *2wenty* was Regal-exclusive, *FirstLook* was fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes. It was also a successor to AMC's ***MovieWatcher Network'**.*

Several different versions were provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating or format; G- or PG-rated family films often featured *FirstLook Play*, while 3D films featured a second segment, *FirstLook 3D*.

*Noovie* was re-launched in December 2021 with new segments designed to make the show "more holistic".

## Fantasy Movie League

In May 2017, NCM acquired Fantasy Movie League, a fantasy movie league where players have $1,000 a week to spend and try to pick a combination of films that are currently out that week that would lead to the most money the films made that weekend at the box office.

Since the purchase, it has also been promoted during *Noovie*.
