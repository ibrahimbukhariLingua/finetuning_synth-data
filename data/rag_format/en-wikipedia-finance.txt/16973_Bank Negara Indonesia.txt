## History


### Early years

Bank Negara Indonesia was established on 5 July 1946 both as a central bank and a commercial bank with Margono Djojohadikusumo appointed as the director and Abdul Karim as secretary. It was prepared to be the Central Bank of Indonesia with the task of issuing and handling Indonesian currency. A few months after its establishment, Bank Negara Indonesia officially distributed the first official currency of Indonesia – **ORI** or ***Oeang Republik Indonesia***.

Following the appointment of the Bank of Java as the Central Bank of Indonesia, Bank Negara Indonesia had its role shifted to that of a development bank, and was later given the right to serve as a foreign exchange bank. Following increased capitalization in 1955, the legal status of Bank Negara Indonesia was changed into that of a commercial bank through a judicial assignment under Emergency Law number 2 of the year 1955. Also in 1955, Bank Negara Indonesia officially opened its first foreign branch in Singapore.

In 1965, it became a single-tier bank (even Bank Indonesia was absorbed); BNI was the bank that granted the first foreign bank licenses during the transition to the New Order, shortly before the reestablishment of Bank Indonesia that same year.


### Bank Negara Indonesia 1946

After a merger period with several other commercial banks, the function and individuality of the Bank were restored in 1968. The status was resumed to that of a state-run commercial bank. The official name was changed to 'Bank Negara Indonesia 1946'.

Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 conducted an operational restructuring program, by formulating the 'Performance Improvement Program' to facilitate a more dynamic role in facing the continuously changing environment. The program covered various aspects, including the improvement of the Corporate Vision and Mission, the refinement of strategic plans, as well as the development of technology and human resources.


### Bank Negara Indonesia

Signifying the determination of Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 to create a new image and attitudes in line with its aspiration to play a more international role and to respond to the challenges of globalization, the Bank changed its corporate logo into a 'Sailing Boat' and introduced the nickname of 'Bank BNI'.

The law number 7 of the year 1992 opened-up opportunities for state-run banks to change their legal status into Limited State-Owned Corporations (or **Persero**). With this change in legal status, the Bank's name was officially replaced with 'PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero)'.

In 1996, Bank Negara Indonesia's decision to become a public company was manifested through an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares through the stock exchange. Bank Negara Indonesia was the first government bank in Indonesia which listed its shares on both the Jakarta Stock Exchange (now Indonesia Stock Exchange) and the Surabaya Stock Exchange. The corporate name was amended to 'PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk', to show its status as a public company.

The government's banking recapitalization program, launched after the economic crisis, provided Bank Negara Indonesia with additional capital of IDR 61.2 trillion.


### Recent development (BNI '46)

The bank introduced the latest logo in 2004. The nickname 'Bank BNI' was changed to 'BNI'.

In 2022, Bank Negara Indonesia officially acquired Bank Mayora and planned to transform the bank into a digital bank that focuses on the MSME segment. Bank Negara Indonesia also established BNI Ventures to do business in the venture capital sector. In 2023, the bank changed the name of Bank Mayora to Hibank.
