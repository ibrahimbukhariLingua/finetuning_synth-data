It provided consulting, technology, and outsourcing services related to incentive compensation management and sales performance management, with a focus on for sales strategy enablement, sales force motivation, sales channel effectiveness, and sales performance insight.
The company was founded by Mark A. Stiffler in 1991. Originally named Simulate, it was renamed Synygy in 1997. Synygy was one of the earliest vendors to enter the Incentive Compensation Management (ICM) space, initially in the provision of ICM outsourcing services in 1993, followed by the creation of ICM software products starting in 2002.

In 2014, Synygy informed its clients that it would be ending support for its software. In 2015, Synygy ceased selling professional services, and by the end of 2015, the company had ceased operations.
