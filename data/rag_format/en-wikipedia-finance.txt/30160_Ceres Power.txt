## Technology


### Ceres Steel Cell

The Ceres patented Steel Cell is a Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) that can operate on mains natural gas for distributed power generation.

The steel cell operates at 500-600 °C which allows the use of cerium gadolinium oxide (CGO) in the anode and electrolyte and the bulk of the fuel cell to be mostly made from ferritic steel.

The technology is reversible. In one direction it can generate electricity from multiple fuels; in the other, it can generate green hydrogen at low cost and high efficiencies.


### Hydrogen

The UK Hydrogen Strategy cites UK companies including ITM Power, Johnson Matthey and Ceres as being at the forefront of hydrogen technology development worldwide.
