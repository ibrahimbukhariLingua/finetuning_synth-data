## Response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine

Hellenic Petroleum, has continued its operations involving Russian crude oil despite the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has drawn widespread international condemnation and economic sanctions against Russia. While the company has sought alternative suppliers, such as Saudi Arabia, Russian crude still accounted for approximately 15% of its intake in the second half of 2021. According to research by Yale School of Management, which assesses corporate responses to the invasion, Hellenic Petroleum falls into the "Grade D" category of "Holding Off New Investments/Development." This classification indicates that the company has postponed future investments or developments but continues substantive business operations involving Russian oil. This stance has drawn criticism as it sustains economic ties with Russia, a country engaged in aggressive actions that have resulted in severe humanitarian crises and civilian casualties in Ukraine.
