The Capitalist Manifesto (Kelso and Adler book)


# The Capitalist Manifesto (Kelso and Adler book)



***The Capitalist Manifesto*** is a 1958 book by Louis O. Kelso, a lawyer-economist and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) inventor, and Mortimer J. Adler, a neo-Thomist philosopher. Kelso and Adler detail the three principles of economic justice, *Participation*, *Distribution*, and *Limitation*. These principles laid the foundation of what eventually came to be called binary economics. The term "binary" comes from attributing all production (participation) and just distribution of income to two factors, the human, classified as labor, and the non-human, classified as capital. In the Preface, Adler acknowledged Kelso as the originator of the theory.
