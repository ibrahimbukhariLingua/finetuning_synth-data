Capco was founded in Belgium in 1998 by Rob Heyvaert as 'The Capital Markets Company NV'. It had offices in Antwerp, London, Toronto, New York, Warsaw, and Frankfurt. In 2001, the company rebranded itself to Capco, and the first issue of the Capco Journal of Financial Transformation was published by The Capco Institute.

In 2015, Rob Heyvaert left Capco with Lance Levy taking over as Capco CEO.

In 2010, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) signed a deal with Symphony Technology Group to buy Capco for approximately $300 million.

In 2017, FIS sold a majority stake in Capco to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), a private equity firm based in New York, making Capco an independent company again. FIS continues to retain a 40 percent equity interest in the company.

On 4 March 2021, Wipro announced that it had acquired Capco for US$1.45 billion. The deal was completed on 29 April.
