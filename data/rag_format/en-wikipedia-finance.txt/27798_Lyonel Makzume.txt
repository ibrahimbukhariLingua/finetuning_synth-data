# Lyonel Makzume



**Lyonel Makzume** (1923 - 1995) was a Turkish businessman of Christian Arab descent and one of the country's top taxpayers.


## Career

In 1944, Makzume founded the Lyonel A. Makzume shipping agency with almost no capital, in Iskenderun, Turkey. His business rapidly grew, so that in 1983, he surpassed Şarık Tara and Vehbi Koç to become Turkey's highest individual taxpayer. Throughout the 1980s, he consistently ranked among the top ten taxpayers.


## Philanthropy

Makzume established İstiklal Makzume Anatolian High School in honor of his late wife, İstiklal Makzume. The school was funded through the İstiklal Makzume Foundation that he created.


## Personal life

Makzume spoke six languages—Turkish, Arabic, English, Italian, Spanish and German—and considered this ability a major factor in his business success. He was the grandfather of singer Jehan Barbur, who has described him as a significant influence on her worldview. Makzume died in 1995, when he was 72 years old.
