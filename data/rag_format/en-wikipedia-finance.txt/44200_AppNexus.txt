AppNexus offers online auction infrastructure and technology for data management, optimization, financial clearing and support for directly negotiated advertising campaigns. It has both demand-side platform (DSP), supply-side platform (SSP), and ad serving functionalities. It integrates with advertising sources including Google's "Authorized Buyers" ad exchange, Magnite, Pubmatic and other aggregators. It operates out of multiple data centers, including one in Amsterdam serving Europe and the Middle East, in a facility shared with Equinix.

In June 2018, AT&T announced it was acquiring the company and putting it under its Xandr division as a subsidiary. AppNexus was reportedly sold for $1.6 billion, while most news outlets speculated the company did not sell for less than $2 billion.

In October 2019, Xandr purchased Clypd, a privately-held technology company focused on enabling programmatic buying of linear television advertising.

In December 2021, AT&T announced that they had agreed to sell Xandr to Microsoft for an undisclosed price, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews.
