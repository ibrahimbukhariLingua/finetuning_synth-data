New Zealand Film Commission


# New Zealand Film Commission



The **New Zealand Film Commission** (**NZFC**; Māori: *Te Tumu Whakaata Taonga*) is a New Zealand government agency formed to assist with creating and promoting New Zealand films. It was established under the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978 (as amended in 1981, 1985, 1988, 1994 and 1999).


## Functions and responsibilities

The New Zealand Film Commission is a Crown entity working to grow the New Zealand film industry. Its statutory responsibility is to encourage, participate and assist in the making, promotion, distribution and exhibition of films made in New Zealand.

Through the financing and administration of incentive schemes it has been involved in more than 300 feature films including *Boy*, *Goodbye Pork Pie*, *Heavenly Creatures*, *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Hobbit*, *Avatar*, *Whale Rider* and *Mr. Pip*.

It is also involved in some television series.


### Film financing and marketing

The NZFC assists New Zealand filmmakers by providing grants, loans and equity financing in the development and production of feature films and short films. It administers the Government's Large Budget Screen Production Grant (LBSPG) and Screen Production Incentive Fund (SPIF) and certifies New Zealand films for tax purposes and co-productions. It also actively markets New Zealand films and filmmakers, and organises high-profile New Zealand participation at major international film festivals and markets. It helps with training and career development within the industry by partnering with other industry organisations.

For example, in 2010 the NZFC unveiled a new program for funding films by filmmakers at the beginning of their careers who have creative ideas for their first feature film specifically designed for low-budget films. ("Directors who have previously received feature film finance from the NZFC" are ineligible.") Called Escalator, the scheme encourages teams, preferably including "their director, writer, producer and possibly a key crew member" to "submit three different proposals for a low budget ([NZ]$250,000) feature film." From those applications, 12 teams are selected to participate in a multi-day "bootcamp" after which they are expected to "prepare a script, production budget, schedule and statement of approach for one of their ideas." Peter Jackson praised the proposal for its "speed or process," reminding his readers that "much frustration has resulted from the slow pace at which a project limps through development at the NZFC."

In fact, the first film to be released with Escalator support was *Existence* (2012; directed by Juliet Bergh; co-written by Bergh and cinematographer Jessica Charlton), which was part of the scheme's second cohort of applicants. The Commission played a role in bringing Mhairead Connor in as a producer as well as providing Berg and Charlton access to script development assistance from Graeme Tetley as part of their bootcamp experience.

The New Zealand Film Commission often works in conjunction with other government agencies, such as the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry for Tourism and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment.


### Film On Demand

In 2014 the New Zealand Film Commission launched a transactional video on demand service, NZ Film On Demand. The site features NZ films for rent and purchase, with a library of films that will grow over time. The underlying technology of the platform was developed by Hamilton, New Zealand based company Indiereign.


### Records

The main classes of records held include:

* Applications for financial assistance for development, production, distribution and promotion of New Zealand films;
* Contracts in respect of investments made by the commission; and
* Contracts in respect of sales of a New Zealand film represented by the commission.

## Structure

The New Zealand Film Commission is governed by a seven-member board appointed by the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. Members represent the film industry and the wider business and arts community. The Board meets every two months to set policy and budgets, monitor progress against targets and budgets and consider applications for feature film production financing.

Day-to-day activities are carried out by a staff of 46 from their Wellington office. The internal structure is based on four business units (Development and Production, Talent Development and Relationships, Marketing and Screen Incentives Administration) and three support groups (Business Affairs, Finance and Strategy and Research) all linked by strong connections across the organisation. Notable staff have included Mladen Ivančiċ, who was appointed as finance director in 1989 and retired in 2023 after serving as acting CEO on six different occasions.


## Controversies

In 2019, the New Zealand Film Commission received public attention and criticism for its taxpayer-funded support of *Wolf Warrior 2*, a film described as Chinese propaganda.

In July 2024, the Film Commission attracted criticism after spending $16,431 on two parties for its outgoing chief executive David Strong and its incoming chief executive Anna Murray.

In October 2024, the Film Commission attracted criticism from Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Paul Goldsmith and the New Zealand Taxpayers' Union after spending over NZ$145,354.81 to send four staff members to attend the Cannes Film Market in May 2024. The money was reportedly spent on accommodation, food and drink and travel. In response, the Film Commission defended the trip, arguing that operating costs were lower than in 2023.
