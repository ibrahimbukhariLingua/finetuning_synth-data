# Largest projects in the Philippine economy



The largest projects in the Philippine Economy includes both megaprojects, costing over $1 billion, and other large investment projects, typically costing between $10 million and $1 billion. Projects with investments below $10 million also may be included here, either as parts of larger projects, or in case of major international significance and media coverage. In case of projects involving new vehicle models, the cost of development is taken into account as well as the cost of production.
