# Doughty Hanson & Co



**Doughty Hanson & Co.** is a British private equity fund manager focused on leveraged buyout and recapitalization transactions primarily of upper middle-market companies in Europe. The firm also invests opportunistically in European real estate and provides early-stage venture capital to technology companies.

The firm which was founded in 1985 by Nigel Doughty, Chris Wallis and Richard Hanson is one of the oldest European buyout private equity firms.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Since its inception, the firm has invested over €23 billion across more than 100 investments.

On 4 February 2012, Doughty was found dead in the gymnasium of his Lincolnshire home.
Then, on 10 August 2015, the firm announced the shutdown of most of its European offices after abandoning its next round of funding. The offices closed in 2015 included Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Stockholm. In May 2017, the firm re-branded itself to DH Private Equity Partners.


## History

Doughty Hanson traces its history back to 1985 when Nigel Doughty and Richard (Dick) Hanson started working together on European buyout investments within Standard Chartered Bank as founding members of its management buyout unit. In 1990 they established CWB Partners, a joint private equity venture between Standard Chartered and Westdeutsche Landesbank.

Doughty Hanson was established as an independent firm in 1995. In 1999, the group expanded its activities with the formation of a real estate investment team and the following year it established a team to focus on early-stage technology venture capital investing.


## Investment strategy

Doughty Hanson's three product areas operate as separate fund families:

* Private Equity – Doughty Hanson's buyout team focuses on majority ownership and control of market-leading businesses at the upper end of the European middle-market with enterprise values between €250m and €1bn.
* Real Estate – Doughty Hanson is an opportunistic investor and developer active in the office, retail and logistics sectors. Investments range from the acquisition of existing single assets and portfolios to more complex developments and urban regeneration projects.
* Technology Ventures – The Doughty Hanson Technology Ventures team targets technology companies within three industry sectors: internet software, mobile communications and clean energy technology.

### Responsible Investing

In June 2007 Doughty Hanson became one of the first private equity signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), which provide a framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices. A year later the firm became the first private equity manager in Europe to hire a dedicated Head of Sustainability to focus on the implementation, management and monitoring of ESG issues across the Doughty Hanson portfolio.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
