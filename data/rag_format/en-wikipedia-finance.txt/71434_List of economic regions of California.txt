List of economic regions of California


# List of economic regions of California



Nine California regional economies and nine associated geopolitical regions were specified in about 1998 by the California Regional Economies Project. California Statewide is the tenth economic region. The California Economic Strategy Panel uses employment and wage information reported by employers, along with these regions, for public policy-making, planning, and program administration. Other agencies, specifically including the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Board of Registered Nursing, also provide reports for the regions.
