## History

The company was established in July 2000 when Lillehammer og Gausdal Energiverk and Hamar-regionen Energiverk merged their respective grid- and trade divisions. On June 6, 2001 Eidsiva Energi and Hedmark Energi merged their grid- and trade divisions. On April 15, 2004 the three lower companies merged and thus creating one large corporation called **Eidsiva energi Holding AS** that included industrial investments and energy production. On April 28, 2005 the company bought Mjøskraft and Mjøskraft Strøm from Hafslund and changed its name to Eidsiva Energi AS in December. In September 2006 it took over the power plants from Vannkraft Øst and Oppland Energi.
