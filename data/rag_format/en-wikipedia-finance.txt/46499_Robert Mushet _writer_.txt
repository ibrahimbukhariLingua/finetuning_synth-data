## Life

The sixth son of William Mushet and Margaret Cochrane his wife, he was born at Dalkeith on 10 November 1782; David Mushet was his brother. He entered the service of the Royal Mint about 1804, and in the *Royal Kalendar* for 1808 he appears as third clerk to the master. Subsequently he held the post of first clerk to the master, melter, and refiner.

Mushet gave evidence before the House of Lords committee on the resumption of cash payments on 29 March and 7 April 1819, as an expert on the currency question. He was also examined before Robert Peel's committee in the House of Commons on the same subject, on 19 March. He stated that he had constructed tables of the exchanges and prices of gold from 1760 to 1810. He was a founder member of the Political Economy Club.

In 1823 Mushet took out a patent (No. 4802) for preparing copper for sheathing ships by alloying it with small quantities of zinc, tin, antimony, and arsenic. He died at Millfield House, Edmonton, on 1 February 1828.
