## History

AIB began as a management consulting firm before transitioning to offer higher education. It was formerly known as the Gibaran Action Research Management Institute and later the Gibaran Learning Group. In 2011, it amalgamated as the Australian Institute of Business, combining the Gibaran Graduate School of Business, the Australian Institute of Business Administration, the Tourism Institute of Australia, and the Entrepreneurship Institute Australia.

Selva Abraham is the founder of the Australian Institute of Business. His focus has been on Work-Based Learning, which he has extended into the concept of Work-Applied Learning. He has published four books on the subjects of work-applied learning, management and action research.

AIB is registered as a higher education provider by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), the government body in Australia authorised to register institutions of higher education.

The Global Centre for Work-Applied Learning (GCWAL) is an independent organisation that exists within the Australian Institute of Business.

In December 2012, AIB signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Middlesex University to allow both institutions to work together to advance work-applied and work-based learning research. This collaboration led to the inaugural Work-Applied Learning for Change conference, where the two institutions partnered to present a conference on the techniques of Work-Based Learning (WBL). In 2015, AIB in partnership with Emerald Group Publishing launched the *Journal of Work-Applied Management*.
