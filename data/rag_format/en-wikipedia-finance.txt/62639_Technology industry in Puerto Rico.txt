## History

In 1999, the technology sector in Puerto Rico was ranked 16th in exports and 37th in employment as compared to the 50 states and Washington DC.

As a result of the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis, interest in revitalizing the economy through the technology sector was expressed, with Alberto Bacó Bagué describing it as "one of the pillars of our economic development program".
