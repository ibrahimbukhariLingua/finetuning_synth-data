## Politics

In September 2018, Mr Cole made a decision to pursue a career in politics. He formally resigned from all board and executive roles held in Sahara Group as well as all his board positions elsewhere to contest for the gubernatorial seat in his home state of Rivers. This is an elective political position in Nigeria. He won the primaries under the national ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and declared the flag bearer but due to a protracted inter-party legal tussle, the party was removed from the ballot and prevented from contesting in the 2019 gubernatorial elections by the courts.
Mr. Cole consolidated on the political gains made to build a formidable team ahead of future elections.

On 26 May 2022, Tonye Cole emerged as the flag bearer of the All Progressive's Congress (APC) for the 2023 gubernatorial elections after winning 77% of the delegate votes at the primaries. On 25 October 2022, a Federal High Court ruling annulled all Rivers APC primaries. The Rivers APC protested the ruling and Cole was reinstated by the Court of Appeal in January 2023.
