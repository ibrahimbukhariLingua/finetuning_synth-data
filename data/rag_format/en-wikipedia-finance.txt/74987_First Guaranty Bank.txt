## Allegation of racial discrimination

In 2019, Nikole Hannah-Jones, in a *New York Times* podcast, asserted that the bank discriminated against two African-American farmers, June and Angie Provost. According to the reporting, the bank is alleged to have engaged in fraud by changing loan amounts and forging the signatures of the applicants. This had the intended effect of putting financial pressure on the Provosts and eventually led them to lose their farm and their home to foreclosure. The case is now the subject of litigation and a federal USDA whistle-blower complaint. The bank denied these allegations, saying that they are "completely unfounded and frivolous", also stating that it "has not and does not engage in discriminatory practices".
