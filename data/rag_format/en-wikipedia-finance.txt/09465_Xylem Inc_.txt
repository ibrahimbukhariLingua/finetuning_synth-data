## History

On January 12, 2011, Xylem's parent, ITT Corporation announced its plan to separate the company into three, stand-alone publicly traded, independent companies". The future water company was named Xylem, pronounced zi-lem. (The name "Xylem", derived from classical Greek, is the tissue that transports water in plants.) It comprises three business units – Water Solutions, Analytics, and Applied Water Systems.

ITT Corporation spun off its defense businesses into a company named ITT Exelis, and retained its corporate name, logo and "Engineered for life" company tagline for its other activities.

In March 2014, Patrick Decker succeeded Steven R. Loranger as the CEO and president of Xylem. Loranger was chairman, president and CEO of ITT Corporation when it spun its water businesses off as Xylem in October 2011.

In May 2023, Xylem completed the acquisition of Evoqua Water Technologies, a provider of water and wastewater treatment solutions and services, in an all-stock transaction valued at $7.5 billion. The combined company becomes the world's largest pure-play water technology company. The structure's projected pro forma revenue is $7.3 billion, with a global workforce of more than 22,000 employees.

The company's revenue for 2023 totalled $7.4 billion, exceeding the reported basis by 33%. The company's net profit totalled $266 million, with a net profit margin of 12.6%.

In May 2024, Xylem, in partnership with the German city of Weissenburg and the Technical University of Munich, launched a revolutionary water-related initiative, Reuse Brew. This is a traditional German pale lager beer made from recycled wastewater. This process, utilizing technology developed by Xylem, involves ozone injection, ultraviolet radiation, hydrogen peroxide pellets, and filtration through carbon and nano filters.

#### Products

The company from the start introduced the first commercial product in many categories: In 1952, they introduced the first quartz crystal electronic stopwatch, and the first practical electronic thermometer. In 1956, first commercial heart-lung machine, in 1957, the first instantaneous blood-gas analyzer.

They continued development in their key area of temperature measurement. They produced the first interchangeable thermistor temperature probes in 1955, and developed it into a complete line of precision interchangeable thermistors in 1961, and in 1965 developed the first linear thermistor temperature sensor, which *Industrial Research* magazine recognized as one of the 100 most significant new technological products of the year. In other analytical instruments, they produced the first practical dissolved oxygen meter for field and laboratory use in 1965, which the same magazine recognized as yet another of the most significant technological products of the year.

Their oxygen meter had used the technique of polarography, and they developed further products on the same principle, including the first immobilized-enzyme-activated polarographic sensor in 1972. They then developed further biomedical instrumentation: the first commercially successful whole blood glucose analyzer in 1975, the first commercial alcohol measurement instrument using immobilized enzyme electrode technology in 1982. They continued using immobilized enzyme techniques, for the first direct whole-blood L-lactate assays using immobilized enzyme electrode also in 1982. They also continued developing thermal technology, with the first commercial gallium melting-point temperature standard (29.7715 °C) in 1977 and the first robotic-manufactured glass-encapsulated precision thermistors in 1996.

They produced their first environmental monitoring instrument, a dissolved oxygen sensor, in 1992. They then developed instrumentation for conductivity measurement of ultrapure water in 1996, and the first accurate commercial fiber-optic based CO₂ measurement system, in 1998.

Beginning in the late 1990s, they began producing analytical software and integrated analytical instrumentation: BOD Analyst(TM), software that automates BOD testing. They also began developing integrated analytical systems: the YSI 600 QS Quick Sample multiparameter spot sampling system, the YSI 5200 Recirculating System Monitor, and the YSI 7100 Multiparameter Bioanalytical System (MBS).
