# Sarenza



**Sarenza** is a French e-commerce company that specializes in selling shoes and accessories. Founded in September 2005, the company has its headquarters in Paris and delivers products to 26 European countries. As of 2014, Sarenza had more than 200 employees and carried a variety of brands and styles. The company has expanded throughout Europe since 2009.


## History

Sarenza was created in September 2005 with the launch of the French website. The company grew as a result of two investments that totaled six million euros, and it focused on international expansion.

Sarenza was restructured in March 2007 when the three co-founders left the company. Stéphane Treppoz then became the president of Sarenza, and Hélène Boulet-Supau became the managing director. They raised three million Euros to continue the company's growth and maintain its lead position in the market with a new, automatic warehouse near Paris, an internal customer service department, and revised business techniques. One year and a half after the direction change, the company was already profitable.

A new investment of three million Euros was granted in April 2009 to finance Sarenza's international development. Two-thirds of this investment came from personal funds given by Stéphane Treppoz and Hélène Boulet-Supau.
On 7 April 2010 at 8:13 p.m, Sarenza.com sold its millionth pair of shoes.
In December 2011, Stéphane Treppoz, CEO of Sarenza and Hélène Boulet-Supau, managing director, acquired complete control of Sarenza. At the end of this negotiation, the Sarenza direction controle over 80% of the company's capital.
In the beginning of 2012, Sarenza became one of the top 15 e-commerce sites the most visited in France, published by FEVAD(Fédération d’e-commerce et vente à distance) and Médiamétrie with 3.8 million unique visitors on average per month during the 1st quarter of 2012.

In June 2014, Sarenza received an investment of 74 million Euros to increase its international expansion, the largest investment in French e-commerce history to that date. The funds were primarily given by the French Public Investment Bank, the BPI.


### Sarenza begins international expansion

The first international opening in October 2009 was the British website for customers living in the United Kingdom. The Italian and German websites followed in December 2010. Then, in the first trimester of 2011, Sarenza arrived in Spain and the Netherlands. In March 2012, a new wave of openings occurred with the launch of the Polish website and the European website, permitting delivery to numerous countries in northern and eastern Europe.


## Key figures

In 2010, Sarenza achieved a revenue of 80 million Euros, four times the revenue of 2008 and 20 times the revenue of 2006.
In 2011, Sarenza reached over 100 million Euros in revenue.


## Items

In June 2012, Sarenza passed the mark of six million items sold since its creation.
Sarenza stocks over one million items in its 18,000 m2 warehouse (as of 2014).


## Business Model

Sarenza is the first French "pure player" shoe retailer based on the model of the American company Zappos, the largest online shoe retailer in the world.

* Free delivery and returns with no minimum spend amount via Hermes
* 100 days to exchange or return an item for free

## Infrastructure

Sarenza's headquarters and offices are located in the center of Paris. All orders delivered to France and throughout Europe are shipped from the warehouse in Réau, which is managed by XPO Logistics, Sarenza's logistics partner since 2016.
