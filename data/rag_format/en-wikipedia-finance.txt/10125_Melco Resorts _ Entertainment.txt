In March 2006, Melco Crown spent US$900 million to purchase the last of Macau's six gaming licenses from Wynn Resorts. The license allowed Melco Crown to "operate an unlimited number of casinos, tables and machines in Macau until June 2022," and the company began developing its first casino. Melco Crown listed on the NASDAQ in December 2006 and launched Altira Macau in July 2007, which was built for $1.45 billion.
