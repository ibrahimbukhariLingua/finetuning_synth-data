Navotas Boulevard Business Park


# Navotas Boulevard Business Park



The **Navotas Boulevard Business Park** is an under-construction commercial and business center in Navotas. It will rise on 650-hectare (6.5 km²) reclaimed land, and has been under-construction since 2019. The development is envisioned to create a mixed-use community with residential, institutional, commercial and industrial areas suitable for port facilities, marine and tourism. Its master plan was designed by Surbana Jurong.


## Background

The project was approved by the City Government of Navotas in 2015. It finally gained the Philippine Reclamation Authority in 2018. Fishermen from the city protested against the project, stating that it will displace them and their livelihood.
