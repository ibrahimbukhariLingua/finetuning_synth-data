Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism (Chile)


# Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism (Chile)



The **Ministry for the Economy, Development, and Tourism** (Spanish: *Ministerio de Economía, Fomento y Turismo*) is a Chilean state ministry in charge of planning and executing the flow of policies and projects of the Chilean government. The ministry aims to generate feasible and sustainable economic development, with stable progressive equality in the allocation of economic interests. The current Minister of Economy, Development, and Tourism is Nicolás Grau.


## History

The groundwork for the ministry was established in the 1930s—a period that saw the creation of the Subsecretary of Commerce that was dependent on the Ministry of Foreign Relations of that era. But the actual ministry itself was realized in October 1941 as Ministry of Commerce and Supply, and by 1942 it was ratified as the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. Subsequently, it was renamed to Ministry of Economy (1953–1960), and hitherto the Ministry of Economy, Development, and Reconstruction.
