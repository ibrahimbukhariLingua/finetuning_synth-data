## History

In 2002, David Goldin created AmeriMerchant, an online alternative finance company specialising in revenue advance services for small businesses that ultimately became Capify. He was also a founding member and the previous President of the Small Business Financing Association (SBFA), formerly known as the North American Merchant Advance Association (NAMAA).

In 2008, the company expanded its operations to the United Kingdom under the name United Kapital, and extended its presence to Australia as AUSvance. Capify initially focused on delivering merchant cash advance (also known as MCAs). Capify expanded its operations to include typical small business loans in 2008.

In 2015, the company rebranded, unifying all the company's brands under the single name of Capify.

By 2017, the company sold its US division, to focus on the UK and Australian markets.

In 2019, Capify secured a £75 million credit facility from Goldman Sachs.

In 2022, Capify revamped its Quarterly SME Business Confidence Survey and introduced a confidence index, which was designed to measure and evaluate the survey results.
