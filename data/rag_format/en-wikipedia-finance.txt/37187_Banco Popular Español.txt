## History

Banco Popular Español (BPE) was founded in 1926.
BPE opened a representative office in Paris in 1968 that became a subsidiary that by 1991 had a network of 14 branches in France.
In 1992 BPE converted its subsidiary in France into a joint venture with Banco Comercial Português under the name Banco Popular Comercial.
BPE established a network of branches in Portugal in 2000.

In 2002 BPE and Banco Comercial Português parted ways; Banco Popular Comercial becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Popular and changed its name to Banco Popular France. In Portugal, Banco Popular buys Banco Nacional de Crédito (BNC) and transfers its existing branches there to BNC. Later, in 2005, BNC changed its name to Banco Popular Portugal.

In 2007 BPE bought a small bank in Southern Florida (United States of America) called TotalBank for US$300 million. The bank has 20 branches in Miami Dade County and more than 400 employees.

On 7 August 2009, Banco Popular Español acquired Banco de Andalucía, which was founded as Jerez de la Frontera in 1844 and had many services in the province of Cádiz, in the territorial area of Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María and Cádiz until 1959 when it expanded into the provinces of Seville and Huelva and changed its name to Banco de Andalucía. Spanish prosecutor José "Pepe" Grinda González believed Gennady Petrov (Russian: Геннадий Васильевич Петров) and his associates and entities related to them had bank accounts with Banco de Andalucía.

In 2017 SRM put Banco Popular under resolution process. All existing stocks and additional Tier 1 instruments are written down. Tier 2 instruments are converted into stocks and then sold to Banco Santander S.A. for €1. On August 8, 2017, it was announced that Banco Santander would sell its portion of Banco Popular's real estate business to the New York City-based private equity corporation Blackstone Group.
