## Plot summary

J. G. "Jeff" Miller, a jovial and athletic writer of thrillers, attempts a career as a lawyer at the insistence of his imposing fiancée Myrtle Shoesmith. His first court appearance is ruined when he recognizes an opposing witness as Lionel Green, who was his archenemy at school. Jeff's insulting cross-questioning of Lionel is reported in the newspapers, and Myrtle disgustedly breaks off their engagement. Relieved to be free of her, Jeff gets drunk. In the ensuing uninhibited mood, he takes the unappetizing rock cakes recently given him by his housekeeper and throws them out the window. They pass through another window across the courtyard and land in the office of the J Sheringham Adair detective agency, startling a man inside. Jeff hastens over to apologise. The man, crooked American private detective Chimp Twist, thinks he is being attacked by one of the victims from his career of petty crime, and hides in a closet. Perplexed to find the office empty, Jeff nevertheless takes the opportunity to study the place and collect details for his next detective novel. He is found there by Anne Benedick, who has come to hire a detective. Lovestruck, and ready for any excuse to be with Anne, Jeff pretends to be J Sheringham Adair and accepts the job.

They are joined by Anne's uncle George, Lord Uffenham. Niece and uncle explain that Lord Uffenham keeps the family wealth as a cache of diamonds, hidden in continuously changed locations around his ancestral home of Shipley Hall. Head trauma from a car crash has caused him to forget the current hiding place. Needing a source of money while he searches for the diamonds, he has rented Shipley Hall to Anne's employer Clarissa Cork, a famous hunter, explorer, and health crusader who has turned the place into a vegetarian resort. To retain access to the property, Lord Uffenham has been masquerading as Cakebread, the butler, whom the lease forbids Mrs Cork to fire. Mrs Cork has observed her ostensible butler searching the house, and sent Anne to procure a detective to keep him under surveillance. Jeff promises Anne that he will keep Cakebread's true identity a secret. Twist hears everything from the closet, and covets the diamonds, but stays away from Shipley Hall for fear Jeff will attack him again.

Jeff goes to the Hall and meets Mrs Cork, who expands his duties to watching her nephew Lionel Green and Anne Benedick, as she fears they are romantically involved. Privately, Lord Uffenham confirms that Anne and Lionel are engaged, adding that it would please him if Jeff took Lionel's place. When the two rivals meet, Lionel wants to denounce Jeff as an impostor. He grudgingly agrees to keep quiet, in exchange for Jeff turning in a favourable report on his activities and clandestinely supplying him with meat.

Mrs Cork patronised J Sheringham Adair on the recommendation of Dolly Molloy, a guest at the Hall. Dolly and her husband Soapy are secretly small-time crooks from Chicago; her real intention was that their old accomplice Chimp Twist would keep watch on Soapy, who seemed to be flirting with Mrs Cork. After Soapy explains that he is merely trying to sell fraudulent oil stock to their hostess, the couple are startled by Jeff arriving in Twist's place. Dolly visits Chimp in London to learn what has gone wrong and he tells her about the diamonds, suggesting that the Molloys steal them and split the proceeds with him. Dolly and Soapy are obliged to keep Jeff's secret, because he has seen them covertly eating meat and can get them expelled from the vegetarian colony, which would ruin their chance of finding the loot. Displeased with this state of stalemate, Dolly begins trying to kill Jeff and make it look like an accident.

Jeff uses him time at the Hall to romance Anne. She stays loyal to Green, but grows a little disillusioned with him as he snubs her to avoid feeding his aunt's suspicions. Meanwhile, Twist receives a letter from Jeff apologising for the rock cakes, and realises he can go to the Hall without danger. The Molloys were not sincere about sharing the loot with him, and Dolly tricks him into being caught searching Cakebread's room. Twist saves himself by revealing Jeff's true identity— J. G. Miller, the man Anne and Mrs Cork both despise for being nasty to Lionel Green in court. Jeff admits that he only came to Shipley to be near Anne, and demonstrates his point by kissing her.

The kiss convinces Mrs Cork that Anne is not involved with Lionel. Relieved, and further mollified by Jeff's flattery of a book she wrote, she does not expel him from her house. She also consents to give Lionel the loan he has been requesting, to allow him to buy into partnership in an interior decorating business. Anne is offended by Lionel's continued secrecy about their engagement, which implies that he cares more about the loan. She also learns of the undignified bargain he made with Jeff.

Lord Uffenham partially recovers his memory and declares that he hid the diamonds in a jar of Pond's Tobacco. The Molloys lock Mrs Cork and her admirer Mr Trumper in the cellar and take the jar by force. Dolly bludgeons Jeff, and Anne, thinking he has been killed, realises she loves him. The Molloys drive away with the jar and Lord Uffenham releases Mrs Cork and Mr Trumper, who discovered their love for one another while in the cellar and are now engaged. In the midst of these tumultuous events, Lord Uffenham remembers that the diamonds are not in the tobacco jar. He hastens to dig them out of their true hiding place, the bank of the pond on the Hall grounds. Anne agrees to marry Jeff.

## Publication history

The novel was first published as a serial in The Saturday Evening Post in November–December 1941. It was published in the US in 1942, but not in the UK until 1946 due to war time tensions between the UK and Wodehouse. Neither the US nor the UK editions had a dedication.

The edition published in Stuttgart, Germany in 1949 by Tauchnitz was dedicated to Bert Hoskins, with whom Wodehouse had been interned in Germany early in the Second World War. Wodehouse sent a gift of each of his later novels to Mr Hoskins. The novel was written in Germany, while Wodehouse was held at Tost.

A collector's edition of the novel was issued in 2005 by Abrams Press, ISBN 978-1-58567-657-6.
