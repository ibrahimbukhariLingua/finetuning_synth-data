**Sama Dubai** (Arabic: سما دبي) was an Emirati real estate company noted for its legal troubles, including arrests of senior management, during its brief existence.


## History

Sama Dubai was founded in 2006 as a member company and subsidiary of Dubai Holding, a holding company set up by the government of Dubai. Sama Dubai was created as a company with wider responsibility and mandate than its predecessor, Dubai International Properties. Sama Dubai is practically the international property arm of Dubai Holding. It develop real estates and properties in numerous countries, globally.

A number of legal issues arose, predominantly related to Sama Dubai's main project in Dubai. The best known of these is the arrest of four senior members of management, including CEO Abdulsalam Almarri, as part of the cleanup of the Dubai property market.

Other disputes relate to Sama Dubai's blocking of transactions, pending irregular payments and statements from the company that it is not bound by investor protection laws, such as the escrow law.

It was announced in the summer of 2009 that Sama Dubai would be merged into Emaar Properties, along with Dubai Properties and Tatweer.
