# Barry C. Lynn



**Barry C. Lynn** is a liberal American journalist and writer. He was a senior fellow at the New America Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C., directing the Open Markets Program. The program was shut down, allegedly for criticizing Google, one of New America's chief funders. He has written extensively on globalization, economics, and politics for such publications ranging from *The Financial Times* and *Forbes* to *Mother Jones* and the *Harvard Business Review*.


## Biography

Lynn was born in Miami, and is a graduate of Columbia University. He has been a reporter for the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse and worked as a correspondent in Peru, Venezuela, and the Caribbean. Prior to joining New America in 2001, he was the executive editor of *Global Business*, a monthly magazine targeted at the managers of multi-national enterprises. He has also worked in factories, construction, landscaping, retail, furniture moving, and as a truck driver. He lives in Washington with his wife and two sons.


## Work

Lynn has written extensively on the potential risks of unfettered globalization and industrial interdependence. In *End of the Line* he proposes that a deeply interconnected global industrial system undermines safety and freedom. His work argues how the relentless quest for efficiency, and practices like outsourcing to a single factory and “just-in-time” production, could create an increasingly fragile system, where one isolated shock could crash entire industries.

Lynn’s work also focuses on the effects of extreme concentration of political economic power. In *Cornered* he argues that radical consolidation has birthed present day monopolies that dominate and control virtually every major industry in America. He argues that these new monopolies are squelching innovation, degrading product quality and safety, and destabilizing vital industrial and financial systems. His work argues that from the American Revolution to the Second New Deal, Americans traditionally resisted concentration of power and believed that its distribution is critical for freedom and democracy. He argues that the US must revive its antitrust laws to recover real open markets, resilient systems, and liberty.

He was a senior fellow at the New America Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C., where he directed the Open Markets Program.

In August 2017, Lynn was fired and the Open Markets Program terminated by Anne-Marie Slaughter, the President and CEO of New America Foundation. A *New York Times* investigation revealed that pressure from Google led to his ousting. The emails sent by Slaughter "clearly show the influence that Google wields over New America’s operations,” stated the Open Markets team in a statement provided to *The Intercept*. A collective letter signed by 25 New America’s former and current fellows, including prominent journalists such as George Packer of *The New Yorker* and notable scholars such as Evgeny Morozov of Harvard University was delivered to Anne-Marie Slaughter and New America’s directors. The letter argued that the handling of the situation by Slaughter had damaged the think tank’s reputation.

Lynn has moved the team of researchers and advocates that had been with him at New America, and has created an independent nonprofit organization, the Open Markets Institute.
