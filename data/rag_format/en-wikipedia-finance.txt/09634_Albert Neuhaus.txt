**Albert Neuhaus** (9 July 1873 - 29 April 1948) was a German politician and civil servant of the DNVP. He most notably served as Reich Minister of Economics in Hans Luther's cabinet from 15 January to 26 October 1925, when he resigned, and was succeeded by Rudolf Krohne.

Neuhaus was born into a family of Rhenish manufacturers, although his father had been residing in Scotland to run a business. He attended university studying in law, and eventually received his Doctor of Law degree from the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg in 1896. He then went into being a civil servant for the Prussian state government, and be 1909 became a Government Councillor. He reached his most senior civil servant position as a Ministerial Director and Real Senior Privy Councillor in 1918. Neuhaus left the government in 1920 he work in the private sector, which he would do until he was appointed minister.

A member of the nationalist party, DNVP, he was appointed Reich Minister of Economics in January 1925. During this time he criticized the German private industry for their spending of foreign capital, and largely spent his time responding to the previous hyperinflation. Notable laws passed during his tenure to achieve this was the Loan Liquidation Act and Bond Redemption Law. He eventually resigned in October 1925, as did two other members of the DNVP in Luther's cabinet. This was in response to the Locarno Treaties, which were sent to the Reichstag, but of which the DNVP declared unsatisfactory because they wished for no concessions to France. After he left, he spent the rest of his career in obscurity and died in 1948.
