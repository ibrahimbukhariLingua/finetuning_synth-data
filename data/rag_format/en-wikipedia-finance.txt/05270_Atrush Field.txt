Atrush Field


# Atrush Field



**Atrush Field** is a Jurassic fractured carbonate oilfield near Dohuk, Iraqi Kurdistan. It was discovered by the Consortium of General Exploration Partners. As of March 12, 2013, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has exercised its option to acquire a 25% Government Interest of the Atrush Field according to the PSC contract.

General Exploration Partners (GEP) held 80% of Atrush and was in cooperation with Aspect Energy International, who owned 2/3 of GEP, thus Aspect Energy International had a share of 53,2%. Aspect Energy International sold its interest in GEP to TAQA for $600 mln, which basically transferred Aspect's interest in GEP to TAQA. Shamaran's interest remained at 26,8% of Atrush, and the remaining 20% is held by Marathon Oil.

In June, 2018 Shamaran Petroleum announced that it intends to purchase Marathon Petroleum's 15% share of the Atrush Block., with effect from Jan 1, 2018. ShaMaran will acquire all shares of MOKDV - Marathon's Dutch subsidiary for US$63m. ShaMaran will then sell 7.5% working interest to Taqa for US$33m. The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019.

Oil began flowing through the Atrush Central Production Facility on July 3, 2017. In September 2017, an agreement for the sale of Atrush oil was signed between TAQA, its partners and the KRG. Under the agreement, the KRG will buy oil exported from the Atrush field by pipeline at the Atrush block boundary. The quality of the oil will force a price adjustment of approximately $16/bbl lower than the dated Brent oil price. All local and international transportation costs will be an additional fee. This discount is based on the principles similar to other oil sales agreements in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.


## Atrush Field Naming Conventions

In 2014 after a meeting of the Atrush Management Committee and the KRG Ministry of Natural Resources Archived 12 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine changes in terminology used with respect to activity in the Atrush Field were made:

* “Atrush Block”, “Atrush PSC” & “Atrush Field” were unchanged.
* The structure (previously referred to as the “Atrush structure”) is renamed after the Chiya Khere mountain, i.e. the Chiya Khere structure.
* All production facilities will be known as the Chiya Khere facilities.
* Future wells will remain sequential but will be referred to as “Chiya Khere”, short-form “CK”, commencing with well #5.
* Well pads will be known as Chamanke A, B, etc.
* Historic wells, AT-1 through AT-4, will retain their original nomenclature.

## Wells


### Atrush-1 (AT-1) Well

Atrush-1 (AT-1) well was successfully spudded on October 5, 2010. The well had a natural flow of 6,393 barrels of oil per day. General Exploration Partners discovered 726 meters of oil column and 120 meter netpay. The well has since been permanently abandoned


### Atrush-2 (AT-2) Well

Atrush-2 (AT-2) well was successfully spudded on May 23, 2012. The well had a flow of 42212 barrels of oil per day using a Submersible pump, estimated to have been the highest flow ever in Iraqi Kurdistan. The design of the DST Program, as well as the permanent completion, was managed by Daniel Riedel, Richard Sharpe, Damon Yarshenko, and Wes Whitman with key execution support provided by core contractors. AT-2 was completed for production in Q3 of 2016.


### Atrush-3 (AT-3) Well

Atrush-3 (AT-3) well was believed the well spudded on 26 March 2013 but there is no information confirming this for now.


#### AT-3 Well Summary

### Atrush-4 (AT-4) Well

Drilled in 2014, Atrush-4 (AT-4) well is the second well to be drilled in support of the Phase One Facility.


#### AT-4 Well Summary

* High-angle deviated well. 82° was the maximum hole angle. This demonstrated that the field could be developed, using directional wells in the face of extremely rugged terrain.
* The well was drilled from the AT-1 pad, which is correctly known as Chamanke-A.
* The Jurassic reservoir is approximately 72m higher than when it was encountered in AT-1.
* Two limited well tests were performed for fluid samples.
* The combined rate of fluid production was over 9,000 barrels (1,400 m³) of oil per day of 26°API oil.
* There wasn't an indication of a gas cap.
* An interference test was also conducted. The test demonstrated instantaneous pressure communication with AT-2.
* AT-4 was suspended as Phase One Facility producer.
* AT-4 was completed for production in Q3 of 2016.
* Clean-up attempts were made during 2018, but resulted in disappointing productivity the well is now awaiting work-over for a smaller pump.

This well encountered the target Formation at 23 metres lower than expected depth. The failure by TAQA's development geologist, well operation geologist and the geological manager to accurately forecast formation depths is rumoured to be a sore point within the partnership.


### Chiya Khere-14 (CK-14) Well

No mention of CK-14 has ever been publicly announced.


### Chiya Khere-15 (CK-15) Well

Chiya Khere-15 (CK-15) is a deviated infill production well at the Chamanke-G drilling location. The well was spudded on October 5, 2019, and came online on December 8,
2019.


### Heavy Oil Extended Well Test (HOEWT)

During 2018 the operator installed heavy oil well testing equipment. The equipment will provide 5,000 barrels (790 m³) of oil per day additional processing capacity at the Chamanke C pad, where AT-3 is located. Heavy oil production to should begin in February 2019.
In fact, the HOEWT was delayed until mid-April., the well was brought on production in Q3 2019.


### Chiya Khere-16 (CK-16) Well

CK-16, a water disposal well, supplements well CK-9. The well reached TD on May 20, 2022, and was completed over the Sarki reservoir in July 2022 and water disposal also commenced in July 2022


### Chiya Khere-17 (CK-17) Well

The drilling and completion, on time and under budget, of a side-track CK-17 well (from Pad A) to recover from the upper Jurassic Sargelu reservoir was spud on April 1, 2021. In July 2022 the well underwent a workover operation to increase production. It was expected to be completed by August 2022.


### Chiya Khere-18 (CK-18) Well

According to a post on Linkedin.com by TAQA's Drilling and Completions Manager during the week of September 6, 2022, CK-18 (Pad G) successfully reached TD as the first horizontal well in the Atrush block. The manager also stated that the horizontal drain length was 1016 metres. The Atrush production well CK-18 , spudded from the Chamanke G Pad, was drilled to total depth in September 2022 with a 950m section drilled horizontally through the Lower Jurassic Mus formation. The well is currently being sidetracked and is expected to be recompleted during 2023.


### Chiya Khere-19 (CK-19) Well

In October 2022 the Atrush production well, CK-19, was spudded from the Chamanke C Pad. Targeting the Upper Jurassic Sargelu
formation, the well is forecast to commence production in Q1 2023.


### Chiya Khere-20 (CK-20) Well

The CK-20 production well was drilled from the Chamanke E Pad in February 2023. The well was drilled to a total depth of 1,753m and
completed over the Upper Jurassic in April 2023.


### Future wells

Drill and complete additional production wells. One of the wells is to be drilled from the Chamanke-A pad several hundred meters to the west of AT-1. The other to be drilled from Chamanke-G pad landing south east of AT-1 and south west of CK-5.The well from Chamanke-A indicated that plans to build Chamanke-D pad to the west of Chamanke-A have been scrapped. This is reportedly due to the inability of the TAQA land negotiation team to secure the property and the incompetence of the facilities construction team to build a pad before 2024. There was speculation that these wells will not be drilled in 2021 or 2022 as TAQA reportedly dismissed their operations geologist, whose presence would be mandatory during drilling. This speculation proved to be false with the drilling of 2 wells in 2022. In fact Atrush capital expenditures for 2022 planned at $116 million ($32 million net to ShaMaran). This capital program includes drilling and completing three development wells, including one water injection well.


### Producing Wells

There are a total of eleven producing wells: Atrush-2, (“AT-2”) Chiya Khere-5 (“CK-5”), Chiya Khere-7 (“CK-7”), Chiya Khere-8 (“CK-8”) and Chiya Khere-10 (“CK-10”). In 2019, Chiya Khere-6 (“CK-6”), Chiya Khere-11 (“CK-11”), Chiya Khere-12 ("CK-12"), and Chiya Khere-13 ("CK-13") have also been added as production wells. In December 2019, Chiya Khere-15 ("CK-15") was also listed as a production well. Well CK-17 has been added as a production well. Atrush production well CK-18, in September 2022. In October 2022 the Atrush production well, CK-19 was spud.

## Facilities

A 30,000 barrels (4,800 m³) of oil per day Phase 1 facilities has been completed. As of September 29, 2017, the facility has achieved a regular daily export of more than 22,000 barrels (3,500 m³) of oil equivalent. Facility production is expected to increase to 30,000 barrels (4,800 m³) of oil equivalent per day during 2017.
In June 2018 Shamaran Petroleum reported a partial blockage of the production facility's heat exchanger. Sediment samples were analyzed and it was determined that the blockage was caused by salt. The most probable source of the salt might be drilling fluid losses from the drilling of CK-5 and AT-2. The heat exchanger was cleaned. A trial process of injecting freshwater at the CK-5 wellhead and separating saltwater out at the production facility's separator have significantly reduced the quantity of salt in the crude to be processed for export.
As of June 2018, approximately 20,000 barrels (3,200 m³) of oil per day of processed oil is being exported. Water injection at the wellhead will continue while gradually increasing production as the field personnel closely monitor the facility. Water injection is limited due to the small daily disposal capacity, once the CK-9 water disposal well is completed in the second half of 2018, the capacity will increase. The average daily production for 2018 was about 22,200 barrels (3,530 m³) of oil per day, the rate at the end of December 2018, was 27,500 barrels (4,370 m³) of oil per day.
During 2019, debottlenecking the 30,000 barrels (4,800 m³) of oil per day facility will occur.

Average production for November 2019 was 43,360 barrels (6,894 m³) of oil per day.

An Early Production Facility (EPF) was installed at the Chamanke E pad in Q3 2019. The EPF has a capacity of 10,000 bbl per day.
