## History

The company was established as "Japan Tourist Bureau (ジャパンツーリストビューロー, *Japan Tsūrisuto Byūrō*)" in 1912, primarily serving foreign visitors to Japan. In 1941 the company was renamed as East Asian Travel Agent (東亜旅行社, *Tōa Ryokōsha*), and in the following year changed its status from corporation to foundation, while still retaining its travel agency functions. After World War II, the company was renamed as "Japan Travel Bureau (日本交通公社, *Nihon Kōtsū Kōsha*)". In 1963, Japan Travel Bureau was divided into two separate entities, with the travel agency arm becoming an independent corporation while the foundation remained a non-profit organization. However, both organizations retained the Japan Travel Bureau banner. On 1 January 2001, the corporation was renamed "JTB Corporation", while the foundation retained the Japan Travel Bureau name. In 1997, its operations began.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The original JTB company, "JTB Corporation", has since diversified into other businesses including pharmaceuticals, financial services, consumer goods, publishing, telecommunications and more. The entity that operates its flagship travel business is JTBGMT which supplies tours and other Japan Travel products directly to customers and to travel agents under its "Sunrise Tour" brand. The publishing arm of JTB Corp. produces the popular "Rurubu" magazine which, in 2010, was recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as most widely-sold travel guide series in the world. The company also publishes the *Japan in Your Pocket* series of tourist guide mini-books.
