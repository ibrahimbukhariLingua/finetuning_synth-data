Bank of Guatemala


# Bank of Guatemala



The **Bank of Guatemala** (Spanish: *Banco de Guatemala*) is the central bank of Guatemala. It was established in 1945.

Its headquarters is one of the most recognized Brutalist themed architectural structures. Designed by architects José Montes Córdova and Raúl Minondo, the iconic bank stands within the heart of the city's civic center. In collaboration with Guatemalan artists Dagoberto Vásquez Castañeda and Roberto González Goyri, the design highlights its Mayan heritage through the decorative East and West facing façades. Standing at 40 meters high, the concrete structure, in its materiality, reflects the Brutalist movement and its emphasis on a utilitarian design approach, but also slightly combats the movement due to the unique details of its façade. The beautiful design expresses an ornate subtlety which pays homage to the artistic importance Guatemalan culture has had on its urban landscape.
