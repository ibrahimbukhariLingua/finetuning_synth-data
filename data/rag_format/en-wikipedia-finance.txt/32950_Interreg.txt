Interreg


# Interreg



**Interreg** is a series of programmes to stimulate cooperation between regions in and out of the European Union (EU), funded by the European Regional Development Fund. The first Interreg started in 1989. Interreg IV covered the period 2007–2013. Interreg V (2014–2020) covers all 27 EU member states, the EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein), six accession countries and 18 neighbouring countries. It has a budget of EUR 10.1 billion, which represents 2.8% of the total of the European Cohesion Policy budget. Since the non EU countries don't pay EU membership fee, they contribute directly to Interreg, not through ERDF.


## Aims of the programme

Interreg is designed to stimulate cooperation between member states of the European Union on different levels. One of its main targets is to diminish the influence of national borders in favor of equal economic, social and cultural development of the whole territory of the European Union.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Interreg goal is designed to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion throughout Europe, by fostering the balanced development of the continent through cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation. Special emphasis has been placed on integrating remote regions with those that share external borders with the candidate countries.


## Organisation

Interreg was launched as Interreg I for the programming period 1989–1993 (budget EUR 1.1 billion), and continued as Interreg II for the subsequent period 1994–1999. It moved on to Interreg III for the period 2000–2006. Projects from that closed by the end of 2008. Interreg IV covered the years 2007–2013. Interreg V operated in the period from 2014 through 2020. Interreg VI is currently operational, from 2021 until 2027.

Interreg differs from the majority of Cohesion Policy programmes in one important respect: it involves a collaboration among authorities of two or more Member States. Interreg measures are not only required to demonstrate a positive impact on the development on either side of the border but their design and, possibly, their implementation must be carried out on a common cross-border basis.

Once the Operational Programmes have been approved by the European Commission, the implementation of the programmes is co-ordinated by steering committees, which consist of representatives of the authorities responsible for Cohesion Policy measures in each member state. These can be both central state agencies and regional agencies. Like almost all Cohesion Policy measures, Interreg projects require co-funding to be provided by Member States, regional authorities or the project leaders themselves. The amount of co-funding required differs by region, ranging from 50% down to 0% in the poorest regions.

The final beneficiaries of Interreg funds are usually public authorities, interest associations and non-profit organisations, such as chambers of commerce, employer organisations, unions or research institutes. Under Interreg IV, private firms are only eligible if they apply through a consortium of several firms; in previous programme periods, they were not eligible at all.


## Strands

Interreg is made up of three strands: Interreg A, Interreg B and Interreg C. They are described in more detail below.


### Strand A: cross-border cooperation

Cross-border cooperation between adjacent regions aims to develop cross-border social and economic centres through common development strategies. The term cross-border region is often used to refer to the resulting entities, provided there is some degree of local activity involved. The term Euroregion is also used to refer to the various types of entities that are used to administer Interreg funds. In many cases, they have established secretariats that are funded via technical assistance: the Interred funding component aimed at establishing an international presence for local Interreg deployment. Interreg A is by far the largest strand in terms of budget and number of programmes.


### Strand B: transnational cooperation

Transnational cooperation involving national, regional and local authorities aim to promote better integration within the Union through the formation of large groups of European regions. Strand B is the intermediate level, where generally non-contiguous regions from several different countries cooperate because they experience joint or comparable problems. There are 13 Interreg IVB programmes.


### Strand C: interregional cooperation

Interregional cooperation aims to improve the effectiveness of regional development policies and instruments through large-scale information exchange and sharing of experience (networks). This is financially the smallest strand of the three, but the programmes cover all EU Member States.


## Interreg III

Period 2000-2006


### Strand A: cross-border cooperation

Priorities for action in strand IIIA were:

* Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development
* Strengthening the spirit of enterprise
* Developing small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the tourism sector
* Developing local employment initiatives
* Assistance for labour market integration and social inclusion
* Initiatives for encouraging shared use of human resources, and facilities for research and development, education, culture, communication, health and civil protection
* Measures for environmental protection, improving energy efficiency and renewable energy sources
* Improving transport, information and communication networks and services, water and energy systems
* Increasing cooperation in legal and administrative areas
* Increasing human and institutional potential for cross-border cooperation

#### Examples of Interreg IIIA programmes

* Alcotra, a French-Italian cross-border programme in the Alps
* Italia-Malta, an Italian-Maltese programme

### Strand B: transnational cooperation

Proposals for transnational cooperation under IIIB had to take account of:

* Experience from previous Interreg programmes;
* Priorities for Community policies, especially trans-European transport networks;
* Recommendations made in the European Spatial Development Plan (ESDP).

Within this context, the priorities for action whereas follows:

* Drawing up regional development strategies at transnational level, including cooperation between towns or urban areas and rural areas
* Promoting effective and sustainable transport systems, together with better access to the information society. The aim here is to facilitate communication between island or peripheral regions.
* Promoting protection of the environment and natural resources, particularly water resources.

In the specific case of ultra-peripheral regions, transnational cooperation encourages the following initiatives:

* Economic integration and improved cooperation between these regions and regions in other Member States
* Improved links with the countries of their wider geographic area (Caribbean, Latin America, Atlantic Ocean, North West Africa and the Indian Ocean)

#### Examples of Interreg IIIB projects

* HST Connect, an INTERREG IIIB North West Europe Programme project on high speed train connections
* The European Garden Heritage Network

### Strand C: interregional cooperation

Interreg IIIC promoted interregional co-operation between regional and other public authorities across the entire EU territory and neighbouring countries. It allowed regions without joint borders to work together in common projects and develop networks of co-operation.

Co-operation under Interreg IIIC gave access to experience of other actors involved in regional development policy and created synergies between "best practice" projects and the Structural Fund's mainstream programmes. The overall aim was to improve the effectiveness of regional development policies and instruments through large-scale information exchange and sharing of experience (networks) in a structured way.

Priorities for action included research, technology development, enterprise, the information society, tourism, culture, and the environment.


#### Examples of Interreg IIIC projects

* Interregional Co-operation on Biomass Utilization, aiming to establish an interregional network of actors in the field of biomass utilization
* Adriatic Action Plan 2020, on sustainable development
* Connected Cities, on sustainable mobility and spatial development
* TranSUrban, on urban regeneration and public transport
* Urbike, on cycling in cities
* Wireless cities, which aims to increase ICT usage in some cities
