Ferrovia Paulista S/A


# Ferrovia Paulista S/A



**Ferrovia Paulista S/A (FEPASA)** was a São Paulo state-owned freight and passenger railway company, created by merging Paulista Railroads Company (CPEF), Mogiana Railroads Company (CMEF), Sorocabana Railroad (EFS), Araraquara Railroad (EFA), and São Paulo-Minas Railroad (EFSPM). It remained in activity from October 1971 until May 1998, when it was extinguished and incorporated into the Federal Railway Network S/A (RFFSA).


## History


### Background

Despite the great contribution of the São Paulo railroads to the development of the state of São Paulo until the middle of the last century, after 1945 they entered a process of stagnation and obsolescence due to lack of technical, operational, and physical adaptation. As a way to reverse this situation, Governor Carvalho Pinto opted for the creation of a single company, an idea which began to take shape in 1961 when the São Paulo Engineering Institute, on its initiative, suggested the formation of the Paulista Railway Network (RFP), being presented in 1962 with a message sent to the Legislative Assembly proposing the unification of São Paulo's railroads as an economic measure, since there were five different state-owned railroads in the state. There was a rejection of this proposal, being forwarded again in 1966 and again rejected by the Legislative Assembly.

On May 29, 1967, with Decrees Nos. 48,028 and 48,029, Governor Abreu Sodré took the first step by transferring the administration of the EFA to the CPEF, and the administration of the EFSPM to the CMEF. Then, following the example of what was already occurring with CPEF and CMEF, the governor, through the Decree-Law of September 18, 1969 transformed the other railroads owned by him into joint-stock companies.


### Foundation

The consolidation of the railroads' unification occurred during Laudo Natel's government, when he sanctioned the creation of the new company through Decree No. 10,410 of October 28, 1971, making FEPASA official. Instead of a merger among all the companies, as the letter of the act stated, it was decided in an Extraordinary General Meeting called for November 10, 1971, to previously change the corporate name of "Paulista Railroads Company" to "FEPASA - Ferrovia Paulista S/A", followed by the incorporation of the total assets of CMEF, the EFA, the EFS and the EFSPM to FEPASA. Soon afterwards the four companies were declared extinct.

The unification was intended to make possible the centralization of investment program studies and coordination of railroad services, the centralization of imports, accounting and budgeting; uniformity of service and material, as well as the redeployment of existing material and better utilization of personnel.

### Number of employees

In 1970, the number of employees on the forming railroads was as follows: EFS (17,622), CPEF (11,185), CMEF (5,935), EFA (3,179) and EFSPM (603), totaling 38,524 employees. By 1971, the company's railroad workforce was down to 36,665 people,[9] and by 1972 it was drastically reduced to 29,347 people with the transfer of employees to various sectors of the state government.

This policy of reducing the operational staff was constant until the early 1980s, so that in 1982 the number of employees was 19,874, almost half compared to 1970. From then on, the staff was kept stable until, aiming to meet the National Privatization Plan, a process of reduction began in 1994, decreasing the number of employees from 17,029 to 13,432 in 1995, 8,971 in 1996, 8,453 in 1997 and, finally 6,448 in 1998.


### Regional Units

FEPASA had eight regional units (UR), which were as follows:

* UR-1 - Sorocaba
* UR-2 - Botucatu
* UR-3 - Bauru
* UR-4 - Araraquara
* UR-5 - Campinas
* UR-6 - Ribeirão Preto
* UR-7 - Santos
* DRM (Metropolitan Regional Division) - São Paulo, former UR-Subúrbio

## Expansion

The 1970s and 1980s were periods of major investments in the railroad, when, with the support of entities such as the World Bank, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), export promotion entities, and international credit banks, programs were developed to improve and expand the network.

In order to keep up with the development of the state, FEPASA adopted the route-based operational planning methodology, which was more adequate to the demands of the railroad. This allowed for the improvement of rolling stock management and the signing of risk contracts with large customers, involving cargo guarantees by the customers and transportation volume and terms by the railroad. Consequently, many stations and stops were closed, while others considered high production received investments.

The main FEPASA project was the Araguari-Santos Export Corridor, which included the rectification of the route in the old Mogiana Mainline (giving access to the Paulínia Refinery terminal); in addition to the rectification of the route and addition of the dual gauge in the old Sorocabana line, which goes from Campinas to Santos, crossing the Serra do Mar and giving access to the left bank of the Port of Santos. Another important project was the retaking of the *Variante* Itirapina-Santa Gertrudes, in the early 1970s, which shortened by almost 5 km the distance between these cities, and modernized part of the route of the old Paulista Mainline. This new branch line was completed in 1976. Other projects of the company sewere the Juquiá-Cajati Extension, as an extension of the Santos-Juquiá Line in 1981 and a new connection with the South Mainline of the RFFSA network, through the construction of the *Ramal* Apiaí in 1973 and the *Ramal* Pinhalzinho in 1976.

As for the rolling stock, 148 new locomotives and hundreds of new wagons were purchased to replace the obsolete ones. The investments resulted in a significant growth in rail transportation, which grew from 8 million tons/year in 1976 to 22 million tons/year in 1986, a record in the company's history.


## Railway network

FEPASA took over the metre-gauge lines of Sorocabana (2,016 km), Mogiana (1,744 km) and São Paulo-Minas (133 km), and the broad-gauge lines of Paulista (1,225 km) and Araraquara (431 km), totaling 5,549 km of railway lines in 1970. It also rectified several sections of the busiest lines, including electrification and implementation of dual gauge, in addition to building other branch lines (*ramais* and *variantes*). After the reforms and constructions in its network it now had 5,163 km of railroad lines, of which 3,337 km were mainlines and 1,826 km secondary lines or branch lines; not counting the 1,260 km of detours owned by the railroad and 292 km of private detours, totaling 6,715 km.

## Railway Stations

Of the approximately 323 stations on the entire grid (1974), only 32 stood out as the main composers of the rail system:


## Locomotives and rolling stock

Upon its 1971 establishment, FEPASA had 519 locomotives, 1,191 long-distance passenger cars, 102 electric trains for urban passenger transport and 17,200 freight wagons of various types, received from Sorocabana, Paulista, Mogiana, Araraquara and São Paulo-Minas. Later FEPASA acquired new and used locomotives, EMU and mainly freight wagons.


### Locomotive fleet

Initially, FEPASA had the following motive power:

* Narrow-gauge locomotives: 243 locomotives (167 diesel and 76 electric) were received from Sorocabana and 91 diesel locomotives from Mogiana, totaling 334 locomotives.
* Broad-gauge locomotives: 168 locomotives (79 diesel and 89 electric) were received from Paulista and 17 diesel locomotives from Araraquara, totaling 185 locomotives.

FEPASA received a total of 519 locomotives (354 diesel and 165 electric) from its predecessors. As the railroad continued with modernization, 164 of these locomotives were written off between 1971 and 1991, while 136 GE U20C diesel locomotives of both gauges were acquired in the period 1974–1979, this being the largest acquisition in Fepasa's history.

FEPASA also acquired 10 used GE 2-C+C-2 electric locomotives from RFFSA in 1981, 8 of which were completely rebuilt while 2 were retained for parts. Also part of the railroad's modernization process was the electrification of the entire Araguari-Santos Export Corridor, for which 80 Alstom EC-362 electric locomotives of both gauges were to be acquired, the first arriving from France in October 1987. However, these proved difficult to maintain and the railroad's substations could not produce sufficient power output for their operation, and ultimately only two of the 80 EC-362's delivered had ever been assembled and put into operation.

In March 1992, FEPASA had a total of 503 locomotives (357 diesel and 146 electric), and had acquired an additional 7 GE C30-7A diesel locomotives that year from the Cutrale Quintela company.

Between 1992 and 1998, FEPASA did not purchase any additional locomotives, only disposing of those no longer needed, including 11 diesel locomotives which had been transferred to CPTM in 1997. At the time of Brazilian railway privatization, the FEPASA had 291 diesels and 117 electrics, totaling 408 locomotives. Upon FEPASA's dissolution, 172 diesel and 114 electric locomotives were transferred to Ferrovia Bandeirantes S/A (FERROBAN, 286 locomotives total), Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica S/A (FCA) received 91 locomotives (only diesels), and Ferrovia Sul-Atlântico S/A (FSA) received 28 diesels and 3 electrics (31 total).

Most of the former FEPASA diesel locomotives continue to operate on Brazilian rail lines by various operators, primarily by Rumo Logística and VLI Multimodal S/A. All of the electric locomotives have been withdrawn, and have either been scrapped, remain derelict in various railroad yards, such as the Paulista Triage Yard, Sorocaba Yard, among others; or are owned by museums or preservation groups. The retired diesels similarly have been either scrapped or remain derelict in yards, such as Lapa Station, Pátio de Araraquara Station, Paulista Classification Yard, and Calsete Station (MG).

### Locomotive paint schemes

Soon after their formation, the locomotives acquired by FEPASA received the company's first logo, but kept for a while the original painting of the forming railroad, in a period known as the transition phase, until FEPASA had its own locomotive painting scheme, the first of which was based on Paulista's colors.

| # | Period | Paint scheme | Observation | Image |

### Freight wagons

In 1971, FEPASA had about 17,200 wagons that were received from Sorocabana (9,176), Paulista (4,490), Mogiana (2,803), Araraquara (625) and São Paulo-Minas (182), of which about 60% were deficient. Due to this situation, FEPASA began to order new wagons from domestic factories, such as COBRASMA, in order to meet the needs of the railroad and prepare it to meet the growing demand for export cargoes. Companies were also hired to recover and better use a good part of the deficient wagons.

But many were already unserviceable and became scrap, and therefore the quantity was reduced over time, so much so that in 1977 there were 16,329 wagons and in 1983 the number was 14,430 wagons.

In the 1990s, there was a reversal in the railroad's freight transport, with priority given to soybeans and liquids, characterized by the expansion of the hopper and tank car fleet. FEPASA entered into a partnership with the Cutrale-Quintela (CQ) holding company in 1991, worth US$30 million to transport soybeans and oranges (citrus meal). CQ acquired 7 Dash-7/C30-7 locomotives (out of 40 promised) while FEPASA would supply 800 wagons. The bankruptcy of BANESPA, the change of management from Quércia to Fleury, and problems with FEPASA caused the partnership to be altered until it was extinguished in 1996. Sometime later, CQ went bankrupt.

When FEPASA was formed, services were maintained according to the pattern established by the now-defunct CPEF, with 60 trains a day in both directions and throughout the broad-gauge network. However, the degradation of the service and the age of the material used were already showing signs that passenger transport would enter an ultimate phase, as a survey carried out between 1970 and 1974 pointed out a decrease in passenger movement, comparing it with transport by road bus, where the train carried 10.6% of the total that buses had carried in 1970, and shows that already in 1974 it carried only 4.2% of the bus.

In this period few measures were taken, where traffic in the busiest areas was maintained, but with the suppression of service in the extensions and in some lines of the trunk line as well, such as the one from Barretos to Colombia.

So new train formats were applied, such as the regular PM, PS, and PP trains (Passenger Mogiana, Passenger Sorocabana, and Passenger Paulista). Among the stations that were in operation, only the busiest ones remained open. Services like the Pullman class cars were extinct, wooden cars were switched to "unpaid" service, and a first reform of the fleet was carried out. In 1983 the second painting pattern used by FEPASA on passenger cars appeared (blue with two white stripes), a little different from the first painting that was entirely blue as in the CPEF.

It was only during the Quércia administration, in 1988, that a new reformulation of the trains began, with the creation of the "*Trem Diferenciado*" (Differentiated Train). It was the way found to renew the image of passenger service, proposing improvements in the operation and rolling stock with moderate investment. At this time, the third painting pattern for the carbon steel cars (gray with three stripes: red, white, and black) was created. The project was inaugurated in September 1988 with 12 reformed carbon steel cars, where each composition was formed by six cars, one which ran the São Paulo-Barretos line and another which ran the São Paulo-Marília line. This train was considered "*parador*" (stopper) as it served all the stations open on the lines, with just over 30 on each line.

Also in September 1988 the "*Trem Expresso*" (Express Train) was introduced, which served the São Paulo-Araraquara section, and for this another 12 cars were selected and reformed, this time using only stainless steel cars, receiving also the new external paint pattern of the carbon steel cars and each composition was formed by six cars, the same way as the "*Trem Diferenciado*".

These services lasted until the mid-1990s but with several changes, such as the implantation of new cars to the compositions, schedule changes, and even the mixture between stainless and carbon steel cars with different types of painting, breaking the standardization of the compositions.

In 1995, during the Covas government, the new administration set some investment goals, which also included the reform and modernization of passenger trains. The proposal was based on the increase in revenue with a reduction in costs and the renovation of all the equipment and stations, with two fronts to be attacked: the traveler and the tourist - for the latter, TremTur was created, a division of FEPASA in partnership with EMBRATUR, which was given the mission of fomenting railway tourism in the state of São Paulo.

To offer these new services, FEPASA refurbished the stainless steel cars and also some carbon steel cars. At this time, the latest standard of painting for passenger cars appears (three thin continuous stripes - red, white and black - on the skirt of the car, and on the pediment over the windows carried, next to the new FEPASA logo, the name of the company in full, and to identify which train they belonged to, each of the compositions carried its name on a plate or sticker on the side of the car).

The new passenger trains were as follows:

* Bandeirante Trains: to compete with road transport, they were equivalent to the old regular trains.
* Express Trains: were the new models of the fast trains created in the second half of the 80's, now with even luxurious refinements to attract tourists.
* Special Train: created to serve the needy population.

| *Expresso Ouro Branco* | Campinas ↔ Araguari | suppressed in September 1997 |

All passenger trains still in operation were "suspended" by the new FERROBAN concessionaire on January 18, 1999, under the allegation that the service was precarious and offered risk to users. But as the concession notice for the São Paulo network required the maintenance of passenger services for another year, some lines were resumed on August 1, 1999, and the last trains had their operation stopped on March 15, 2001, when, 130 years after the first passenger train in the state of São Paulo circulated, its last attempts to continue were eradicated.

### Freight transportation

| Sources: FEPASA |

EPASA was inserted in the Brazilian railway network as an important agent for the flow of production from the new agricultural frontiers of the Central-West to the highly industrialized region around São Paulo. It was also connected to the north–south rail link in Brazil, essential for the circulation and distribution of goods nationwide. In addition, its access to the country's most important port made it possible for Brazilian products with high added value to be present in the international market.

Freight transportation was FEPASA's most important traffic and source of revenue. The main products transported were cement, cement clinker, iron, steel, fertilizers, paper, cellulose, bauxite, sulfur, ammonium, dolomite, limestone, hydrated lime, phosphates, fuels (alcohol and petroleum derivatives), coffee, sugar, cotton, meat, beans, rice, corn, wheat, soybeans, peanuts, wheat flour, bran in general, vegetable oils, oranges (citrus juices and pellets) and cattle The amount transported of each of these products has varied greatly over the years.

The company's cargo operation extended to the São Paulo coast, down the mountain range to Santos, then heading to Cajati, and on the other side to the extremes of the state of São Paulo, on the borders with Mato Grosso do Sul and Paraná, penetrating Minas Gerais and converging at various points with river navigation and RFFSA.

On the border with Mato Grosso do Sul, along the Paraná River, the rails reached as far as Santa Fé do Sul, Panorama and Presidente Epitácio, with direct loading and unloading operations at the local port.

The railroad's points of contact with the RFFSA, on the border with Paraná, were through the lines in Itararé and Ourinhos, as well as Pinhalzinho on the branch line built by FEPASA to serve the Southern Mainline. From Apiaí, passing through the regions of Itapeva and Sorocaba there was the transportation of industrial limestone and dolomite to the COSIPA facilities. Cement clinker transportation also followed a single flow from Sorocaba to São Paulo, serving the Votorantim Industries.

Minas Gerais was the state with which the São Paulo railroad network was most integrated. From Poços de Caldas, shipments of bauxite went directly to the CBA plant in the Sorocaba region.

The Ribeirão Preto-Araguari stretch, where FEPASA's penetration into Minas Gerais was most accentuated, was part of the railroad connection between the south of the country and the Federal District. For this reason, its entire route was remodeled and the Araguari-Santos Export Corridor, responsible for 60% of all cargo transported by the railroad, drained the crops of the Triângulo Mineiro and Goiás to the Port of Santos. This line, after the rectifications, started to have characteristics that made it possible to better serve a rich agricultural region, one of the largest sugar, alcohol and grain producing centers, absorbing almost all the phosphate rock production of the installed complexes. The stretch is also an indispensable element for the outflow of the most diverse products, both to the Triângulo Mineiro and Goiás, as well as to the Port of Santos and the Port of Paranaguá, axes of intense traffic of railway compositions that transport fertilizers, wheat, cement (in bags and in bulk), limestone for farming, hydrated lime, bran, sulfur and ammonia.

In addition to these connections, FEPASA relied on RFFSA in Jundiaí, which allowed trains traveling on its broad-gauge system access to São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, the Port of Santos, and Bauru, where direct metric gauge traffic was made possible to Santa Cruz de la Sierra on the Bolivian corridor.


## Extinction and concession of the Paulista Network

On March 29, 1996, the CPTM absorbed the FEPASA DRM train systems, and started to effectively operate the current Line 8-*Diamante* and Line 9-*Esmeralda*, which were part of the railway network used for suburban transport in the western and southern regions of Greater São Paulo, and also the Intra Metropolitan Train (TIM) which served Baixada Santista. This split occurred so that the privatization of the FEPASA network could begin and the metropolitan passenger transport services would remain under state control.

On December 23, 1997, FEPASA was transferred to the Union as payment for debts of the São Paulo government and BANESPA by the then governor Mário Covas. On February 18, 1998, by Decree No. 2,502 of the Presidency of the Republic, FEPASA was authorized to be incorporated to RFFSA. The transfer was approved after the authorization given by the Extraordinary General Assembly on May 29, 1998. With this, the line corresponding to the railway network of the former FEPASA was then called Paulista Network of RFFSA.

In the auction for the concession of the Paulista Network by RFFSA, held on November 10, 1998, on B3 Stock Exchange, the winner was the consortium Ferroban for a period of 30 years, renewable for the same period beginning on January 1, 1999, when it took control of the São Paulo line.

In the concession process, FEPASA's original metre-gauge network suffered two splits: the section from Campinas to Uberlândia (MG), originating from CMEF, became under the control of FCA, and the lines from Iperó to Apiaí and from Rubião Junior to Presidente Epitácio, originating from EFS, became under the control of FSA.

In 2002, FERROBAN's control was taken over by the holding company Brasil Ferrovias (BF), which in 2004 transferred the metre-gauge line between Mairinque and Bauru to Ferrovia Novoeste. In 2006, BF was absorbed by América Latina Logística (ALL), in view of the share merger operation.

Since April 2015, the Paulista Network has been managed by Rumo Logística, which merged with ALL. In November 2015, Rumo filed a formal request with the National Land Transport Agency (ANTT) for the early renewal of the Paulista Network concession for another 30 years. The renewal contract was signed on May 27, 2020, extending the concession term until 2058.

In the concession renewal process, the line from Santos to Cajati, with 232 km in metre-gauge, and the Piracicaba Branch Line, with 42 kilometers in broad-gauge, were returned inoperative to the Federal Government.


## Logo

Throughout its history FEPASA had three logos. The first was provisional, with the name FEPASA written in italics and in lower-case letters, and lasted from November 1971 to December 1976. The second was chosen after a contest:

| Position | Office | Responsible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1º | Programação Visual e Desenho Industrial Ltda. | Joaquim de Salles Redig de Campos |
| 2º | Douglas Piccolo Arquitetura e Planejamento Visual Ltda. | Carlos Ferro, Douglas Piccolo, Roberto Rondino e Sylvio Ulhoa Cintra |

The chosen logo was elaborated by PUC-Rio Arts & Design Department professor Joaquim de Salles Redig de Campos. This logo, composed of straight lines crossed at an angle, was officially used until May 1995.

The third logo was developed by architect and designer João Carlos Mosterio Carvalho and adopted between May 1995 and the company's extinction in 1998.
