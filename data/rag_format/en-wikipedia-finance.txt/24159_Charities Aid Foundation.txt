## History

In 1924, the National Council of Social Service set up a Charities Department to encourage efficient giving to charity. This department was later renamed the Charities Aid Fund while the National Council of Social Service became the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO). The Charities Aid Foundation took its current name in 1974 when it became a fully independent organisation.


## Activities

CAF provides services to charities, businesses and individuals in the UK and abroad, including help with fundraising, consultancy, and loans and grants.


### Services to charities

CAF offers banking services through CAF Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CAF that provides banking services to charities and social purpose organisations. The Bank offers transactional current and deposit accounts via telephone and internet banking, and provides lending to customers. In 2021, CAF Bank won Charities’ Bank of the Year at the Charity Times Awards. CAF Bank Limited is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.

The account allows account holders to donate to legitimate charities through a personal account, by phone, post, or online, and can be opened with a minimum of £10. Donations are eligible for tax relief under the UK’s Gift Aid rules.

Through the CAF Charitable Trust, CAF provides major donors with advice for their giving plans across the UK and internationally. CAF offers Donor Advised Fund services and legacy services for gifts from wills. In 2020-21, donations and legacies into charitable trusts increased by 26% to £222.9m.

CAF’s research team has produced an annual report into giving behaviour in the UK – the largest study of its kind – since 2004.
