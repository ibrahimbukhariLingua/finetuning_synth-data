Wald's martingale


# Wald's martingale



In probability theory, **Wald's martingale** is the name sometimes given to a martingale used to study sums of i.i.d. random variables. It is named after the mathematician Abraham Wald, who used these ideas in a series of influential publications.

Wald's martingale can be seen as discrete-time equivalent of the DolÃ©ans-Dade exponential.


## Formal statement

Let {\displaystyle (X\_{n})\_{n\geq 1}} be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables whose moment generating function {\displaystyle M:\theta \mapsto \mathbb {E} (e^{\theta X\_{1}})} is finite for some {\displaystyle \theta >0}, and let {\displaystyle S\_{n}=X\_{1}+\cdots +X\_{n}}, with {\displaystyle S\_{0}=0}. Then, the process {\displaystyle (W\_{n})\_{n\geq 0}} defined by

is a martingale known as *Wald's martingale*. In particular, {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} (W\_{n})=1} for all {\displaystyle n\geq 0}.
