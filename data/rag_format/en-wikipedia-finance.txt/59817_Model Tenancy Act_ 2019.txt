Model Tenancy Act, 2019


# Model Tenancy Act, 2019



The **Model Tenancy Act, 2019** is a proposed tenancy law by the Government of India, designed to overhaul the tenancy market in India.

In 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, spoke about creating the Model Tenancy Act to replace the archaic rental laws of the country, stating that "they do not address the relationship between the lessor and the lessee realistically and fairly". The Act seeks to solve the housing availability deficit and contribute to the Housing for All initiative by 2022.

The draft Act is currently under review by the states and union territories.
