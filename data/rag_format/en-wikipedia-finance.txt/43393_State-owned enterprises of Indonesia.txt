State-owned enterprises of Indonesia


# State-owned enterprises of Indonesia



In Indonesia, **state-owned enterprises** (Indonesian: *Badan Usaha Milik Negara (**BUMN**)*) play an important role in the national economy. Their roles includes contributor for national economy growth, providing goods or services which are not covered by private company, employment provider, providing support guidance to small and medium businesses, and source of government revenue. The Ministry of State Owned Enterprises represents the government's function as a shareholder of most of those companies, while some are represented by the Ministry of Finance.

Aside from SOEs, there are also provincially- or municipally-owned corporations, locally known as *Badan Usaha Milik Daerah (BUMD)*. The primary difference between BUMNs and BUMDs is the ownership of the enterprise, whereas BUMNs are controlled by the Ministry of State Owned Enterprise while BUMDs are directly controlled by the local government. BUMDs roles are similar with BUMNs, with heavy emphasis on providing goods or services to the local community. In addition, there are also village-owned enterprises which are run by village governments.


## History


### Dutch colonial era

During the Dutch colonial era, the government had a monopoly on the opium, pawnbroking (nationalized on 1 April 1901), posts (including the Post Office Savings Bank), telegraph and telephone industry, as well as owning most of the railways and electric utilities. They are managed by the Department of State-Owned Enterprises (Dutch: *Department van Gouvernementsbedrijven*).


### Post-independence

By the end of the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference, the Indonesian government had a major or complete ownership on the public utility, buses, railways, banks and communications.

With the beginning of Guided Democracy in Indonesia, many Dutch-owned companies, or Indonesian branches of Dutch companies, were nationalized (see *Nationalized Dutch companies* below).

During the New Order, the nationalized companies were still state-owned. Some of the companies were listed in the Jakarta Stock Exchange later on.

Today the largest banks in Indonesia are mostly state-owned.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### AKHLAK

On 1 July 2020, the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises uniformized the corporate core values of all state-owned enterprises into what is called AKHLAK. The implementation of AKHLAK in all state-owned enterprises was intended "to create strong SOEs that have global competitiveness with human resources that are qualified, talented, cultured and highly performed." They are:

* *Trustworthy* (*Amanah*) - Being accountable and have integrity in fulfilling mandates
* *Competent* (*Kompeten*) - Learning and growing capabilities continuously
* *Harmonious* (*Harmonis*) - Care for others and respect differences
* *Loyal* - Dedicated and putting the interest of the Nation and State above others
* *Adaptive* (*Adaptif*) - Continuously innovating and staying spirited in driving and addressing changes
* *Collaborative* (*Kolaboratif*) - Building synergy and cooperation

## Types of SOEs

Since 2003, there are two types of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in Indonesia:

* *Perusahaan Umum (Perum)* (lit. 'public company'), are statutory public-benefit corporations with no shareholders. The main purpose of these SOEs is to provide goods and/or services to public. These firms are allowed to pursue profits. Perums, however, are increasingly rare as the government are converting many of them into *perusahaan perseroan* (see below), especially after the 1980s.
* *Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero)* are SOEs which are *perseroan terbatas (PT)* (i.e. a joint-stock company). This type of SOE is more independent than the *Perums* and the main goals of these firms are to gain profits and contribute to government revenue. This type of SOE is easy to recognize because they have the term *Persero* attached to their names. These SOEs, however, are subject to general *perseroan terbatas* laws, and similar to ordinary PTs its establishment and amendments to its articles of association, including increases to its capital, must be executed before a civil law notary with a notarial act, unlike *Perums* where its Articles of association (including amendments and capital increases) is directly legislated.
 There are two sub-type of *Perusahaan Perseroan*:

1. *Perusahaan Perseroan Terbuka (Persero Tbk.)*, or Public company, which are enterprises whose ownership belongs both to the government and to the general public which issue freely traded shares the stock exchange (or in over the counter markets). This subtype of SOEs also has the suffix *Tbk.* attached to their names.
2. *Perusahaan Perseroan Pemerintah* which are enterprises whose ownership are 100% government-owned.

Until 2003, there was also another type of SOE called *Perusahaan Jawatan (Perjan/PJ)* (lit. 'service company') which had operational costs funded from the national budget. Employees of these SOEs were civil servants and the companies were regarded as government agencies. Firms in this category have been either upgraded into other types of SOEs or converted into government agencies.
