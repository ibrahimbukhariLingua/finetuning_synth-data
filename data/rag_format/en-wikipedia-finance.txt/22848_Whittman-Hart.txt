In 1990 the company split, with Merchantz leaving with the software side of the company, and Bernard in charge of the consulting business, which then had revenues of $9 million a year.

In November 2000, Bernard announced that the company would focus on more traditional companies, helping with building e-commerce operations, and would drop more than 1,000 clients, concentrating on 500 of its best customers .

In December 2000, Francisco Partners LP, a private equity firm, agreed to invest $150 million in the company in exchange for preferred stock, which, when converted, would equal a 32 percent share of the company.

On March 13, 2001, Bernard, the chairman and chief executive, resigned, along with Chief Operating Officer Thomas Metz and Joseph Bong, executive vice president of client services. At that point, the company had laid off 1,500 employees in the prior four months.

By March 28, the company stock was trading for $0.16 per share. On April 2, the company announced 1,700 layoffs.

On April 13, 2001, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On May 1, 2001, the company filed for a liquidation under Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code.

The company sold most of its assets to Divine for $120 million; that company went bankrupt in 2003. Former management, including Bernard, also acquired some assets of the company. SBI, a professional services company based in Salt Lake City, acquired additional assets of the company in June 2001. marchFIRST Norway was acquired by Itera ASA in July 2001.


## Post-bankruptcy

While the company's assets were liquidated in the middle of 2001, its remaining corporate shell remained mired in bankruptcy proceedings for the next two years.
