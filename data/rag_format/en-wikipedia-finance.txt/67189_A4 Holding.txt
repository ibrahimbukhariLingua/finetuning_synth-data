## History

**Autostrada Brescia Verona Vicenza Padova** (P.IVA 00212330237; Verona CCIAA: 57409/1952) was the operator of Brescia–Padua section of Autostrada A4 and Autostrada A31. On 6 December 2011, the company was renamed to **A4 Holding S.p.A.**, with a new subsidiary (P.IVA 03614140238; Verona CCIAA: 0350682) owned the concession to operate the toll road, effectively spin off the function of holding company from the operator.

The concession of Autostrada A31 was originally expired on 30 June 2013, which was agreed in 1999, after that the company started to construct the extension from Vicenza to Rovigo in the south in 2005. The concession was challenged by the European Commission in 2004. The European Court of Justice ruled that Italy failed to fulfill the obligations under European Council Directive 93/37/EEC. On 3 October 2006 Italian Decree-Law 262/2006 was announced, which amended the power of ANAS (both operator and regulator of Italian toll roads) in order to comply with EU rule. On 12 October European Commission sent a formal notice (applying Article 258 of TFEU) to Italy regarding the issue (infringement procedure N° 2006/4378). In July 2007 the concession was extended to 31 December 2026, applying Decree-Law 262/2006. The concession was confirmed by Decree-Law 59/2008 and Law 101/2008, despite the status of the infringement procedure. On 8 October 2009 European Council closed the case.
