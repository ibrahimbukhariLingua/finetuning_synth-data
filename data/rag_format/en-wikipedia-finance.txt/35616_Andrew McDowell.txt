## Public career


### Economic Advisor

He began working for Fine Gael as an economic advisor in 2007. He became the party's head of research in 2009. He was the author of many of the party's economic policies, including the proposal to establish Irish Water.

He was a participant in negotiations between Fine Gael and the Labour Party which led to both parties going into government together. Following the formation of the government, he was appointed as one of Enda Kenny's two main advisors, his chief economic advisor. His salary was criticised by the Leader of the Opposition, Miche치l Martin.

He was a member of the Economic Management Council, a cabinet sub-committee which took decisions related to the Irish economic crisis. Midway through the coalition, he was the lead negotiator with the Labour Party on policy priorities.

He was credited with creating the slogan "keep the recovery going" used by Fine Gael in the 2016 Irish general election. He was again involved in Fine Gael negotiations following the election. He negotiated with Fianna F치il to establish a confidence and supply agreement which led to Fine Gael returning to government.
