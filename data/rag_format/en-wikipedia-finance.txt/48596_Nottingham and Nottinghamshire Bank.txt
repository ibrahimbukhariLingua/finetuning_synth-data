Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Bank


# Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Bank



The **Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Bank** was a joint stock bank which operated from its headquarters in Nottingham from 1834 to 1919.


## History

It was established in Nottingham as the Nottingham & Nottinghamshire Banking Company. The initial capital was £500,000 (equivalent to £60,700,000 in 2023). The bank began trading in Pelham Street in central Nottingham on 19 April 1834 under the management of Peter Watt, a Scottish banker. By the 1840s the bank's London agents were the London and Westminster Bank.

In 1841 the bank ran into difficulty but shareholders injected money and it survived.

A new head office building was constructed in Nottingham on Thurland Street in 1881. It was built to the designs of the architect Watson Fothergill.

In 1884 the bank assumed limited liability as Nottingham & Nottinghamshire Banking Co Ltd with a capital of £1.3 million (equivalent to £171,170,000 in 2023).

In 1891 the bank suffered an embarrassment when it was revealed that the manager of the Newark branch, Robert James Beard, had defrauded the bank of £25,000 (equivalent to £3,448,700 in 2023) before drowning himself in the River Trent. The bank covered the loss from its reserves.

It was acquired by the London, County, Westminster & Parr's Bank in 1919.


## Branches

The bank opened around 39 branches and sub-branches. In 1919, 20 branches and 18 sub-branches were operating. The following were the locations of the branches:
