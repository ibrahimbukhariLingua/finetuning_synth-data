## Early life and education

The youngest of four siblings, Taseer Badar was born October 1, 1973, in Lahore, Pakistan, where he spent the first 10 months of his life before immigrating to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. His mother, Kausar, was a Nuclear Medicine Technologist Professor in Chemistry at VA Medical Center in her native home in Pakistan, and his father, Tanwir, was a Professional Engineer (PE) and Associate Professor at King’s College London in Strand, London.

While enrolled at Humble High School, he began a lawn mowing business. Later, at Texas A&M University, where he earned his Bachelor of Business Administration in Entrepreneurship and Finance from the Mays School of Business, he ran a toner company that shipped to clients.


## Career

In 1996, Badar began his financial advisor career with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. in New York City, where he built strong relationships with his clients. Shortly after, he returned to Houston, began a retail brokerage firm, and began working with physicians who needed help investing their money.

Badar founded Altus Health in 2003, beginning with facilities specializing in imaging, sleep, and related surgeries. In 2014, as CEO of Altus Health, Badar opened Altus House, the first in-patient hospice unit in Sugar Land, TX. ZT Corporate exited this hospice in 2019.

That year, Badar ventured into Florida and purchased several dealerships, including Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, Kia, and Mazda vehicles. This collection would soon become ZT Motors, now known as ZT Automotive.

Altus Healthcare System, a company owned by Badar, acquired six freestanding emergency centers in the Houston area, previously owned by Neighbors Health, in November 2018. Badar stated, "This acquisition allows our community to continue to access exemplary medical care… [that shares] our dedication to patients, culture, and community.”

To further expand his business endeavors, Badar began a partnership with Swapnil Agarwal, Founder and Managing Principal of Nitya Capital, in 2020.

Badar was named one of the Five Most Admired CEOs by the Houston Business Journal in 2021. Additionally, ZT Corporate was ranked number 99 on the Houston Business Journal’s 2021 Fast 100.

In 2022, then-Mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner spoke on the notability and importance of Taseer Badar’s company, ZT Corporate. He stated, “ZT Corporate is a vital asset to [Houston] citizens as a longtime local employer and has positively affected many lives through [its] healthcare organizations and philanthropic efforts.”

The Houston Business Journal named ZT Corporate number four on the list of the largest Houston-area venture capital and private equity firms for 2023, number one on the list of 2023’s largest Houston-area minority-owned businesses, and number one on the 2023 list of the largest Houston-area Asian-owned businesses. Furthermore, ZT Automotive was included on the Top 150 Dealership Groups of 2023 from Automotive News.

Furthermore, in 2023, ZT Corporate completed a strategic management buyout of ZT Motors, followed by Badar’s assumption of an active role as ZT Motors’s CEO.

Additionally, Badar’s portfolio company, Altus Community Healthcare, acquired Exceptional Emergency Center in 2023. This acquisition of 14 freestanding emergency rooms across Texas brought Badar’s portfolio of freestanding ERs up to 30, making Altus Community Healthcare the largest operator of freestanding ERs in Texas.

Badar’s ZT Corporate was named the largest Houston-area minority-owned business by the Houston Business Journal for 2024 ahead of further growth. Shortly after earning this title, ZT Corporate's ZT Automotive acquired four additional automotive dealerships from Greenway Automotive of Orlando.

In October of 2024, Taseer Badar was again included on the Aggie 100 list for 2024. With this addition, Badar was granted the distinction of receiving the highest number of Aggie 100 trophies by one leader with 34 trophies.


## Philanthropic Efforts

In 2017, Badar founded ZT Baseball, a non-profit organization that provides opportunities and exposure for young baseball players while competing on the highest level. Working with more than 100 teams and 130 coaches throughout Arizona, California, Louisiana, Nevada, and Texas, the organization focuses on college placement and skill development and prioritizes its affordability for players and families.

ZT Baseball Foundation has benefitted more than 500 athletes to date by removing the financial challenges of tournament costs, uniforms, travel, accommodation, training at world-class facilities, equipment, access to high-profile coaches, and more.

At the 2023 Chairman’s Gala, an annual celebration hosted by ZT Corporate, Badar and attendees raised funds for the ZT Baseball Foundation.
