## History


### 2014–2020

**Ryde Group** Ltd was founded by Terence Zou in 2014 during the expansion of ride-hailing services in Southeast Asia. Prior to founding the company, Zou served in the Republic of Singapore Navy for eight years, commanding the RSS Resilience and receiving the Queen's Binoculars award in 1995 at Britannia Royal Naval College. Following his military service, he obtained an MBA from Harvard Business School and worked in finance. Zou conceived the idea for a carpooling platform in 2004 while serving in the Navy and later left his finance career to launch Ryde.

Originally launched as a social carpooling platform, Ryde later expanded its services to include private-hire and taxi bookings, as well as on-demand courier services. In 2020, the company launched the Ryde Education Merit Awards to provide financial assistance to the children of its driver-partners. This program was later expanded to include scholarships. In 2015, the company was certified by the Singapore Centre of Social Enterprise and became part of DBS Bank's Asia-for-Good programme.


### 2021−2024

In March 2021, Ryde appointed SAC Capital to oversee its preparations for a listing on Catalist. During the same year, Ryde also launched an NFT collection. The company was subsequently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in March 2024. In June 2024, it was also listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange (XSTU) under the symbol D0S.

In December 2024, Ryde's licenses for full ride-hail and carpool services were renewed for a three-year period.
