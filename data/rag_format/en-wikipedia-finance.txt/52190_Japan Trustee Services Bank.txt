## History

JTSB was established on June 20, 2000, by Daiwa Bank and Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. and began operations on July 25, 2000. Sumitomo Trust transferred part of its trust business and other assets to JTSB in October 2000, and Daiwa followed suit in June 2001. The Mitsui Trust Financial Group invested in JTSB in 2002 and transferred some of its trust operations to JTSB in 2003.

Daiwa merged with Asahi Bank in 2003 to form Resona Bank, and Sumitomo Trust merged with Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings in April 2011 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings.

In 2014, Toyota announced the establishment of a foundation to support development and environmental protection in the automotive industry, which was to be funded by dividends from a pool of 30 million Toyota shares sold to JTSB for one yen per share.
