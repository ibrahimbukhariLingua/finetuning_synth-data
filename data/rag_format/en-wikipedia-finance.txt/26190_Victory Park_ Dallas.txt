Victory Park, Dallas


# Victory Park, Dallas



**Victory Park** is a master planned development northwest of downtown Dallas, Texas (USA) and north of Spur 366 (Woodall Rodgers Freeway). It is along Interstate 35E, part of the Stemmons Corridor and Uptown.

The US$3 billion project, at 75 acres (0.30 km²), is just north of the West End Historic District of downtown Dallas. When it is finished, the project will contain more than 4,000 residences and 4,000,000 square feet (370,000 m²) of office and retail space.


## History

Victory Park was developed by Ross Perot, Jr., son of billionaire tycoon Ross Perot, who was a majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA basketball team. Perot envisioned Victory Park as an "urban lifestyle destination." Anchored by the American Airlines Center, home of the Mavericks, the entire development was planned at a very detailed level by its developers.

The development has been criticized as being a "collection of imposing hyper-modern monumental structures, high-end chain stores, enormous video screens, expensive restaurants, a sports arena and tons of parking, completely isolated from the rest of the city by a pair of freeways . . . like the schizophrenic dream of some power-hungry capitalist technocrat." However, other journalists have countered this criticism of New Urbanist principles, citing that developments like Victory Park build on a classic, centuries old formula and "are not a quick fix but the slow weaving together of smart, sometimes big, often small, urban solutions" to create viable and enduring community destinations.
