AXA Tower


# AXA Tower



**AXA Tower**, also known as **8 Shenton Way** and formerly **The Treasury** and **Temasek Tower**, was the 16th-tallest skyscraper in Singapore, at 234.7 m (770 ft), and the tallest cylindrical building in the world. In 2023, it became the tallest building to ever be voluntarily demolished.


## Background

Built in 1986 for the Singapore government's Ministry of Finance as the Treasury Building, with 52 storeys it at once became one of the most prominent buildings in the city's business district. Singapore's former Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, had his office in the building, while he was Minister for Finance from 2001 to 2004.

The Advertising agency BBDO Worldwide later had its Asia Pacific Headquarters in the building, and the 14th floor housed the Embassy of Belgium.


## Architecture

The structure consisted of steel beams cantilevered from a cylindrical concrete core, allowing full 360° views at the perimeter, unobstructed by perimeter columns. The tower housed sixteen double deck elevators supplied by Otis.


## Owners

When the Ministry of Finance relocated to *The Treasury* on High Street, the building was transferred to Temasek Holdings, a government-owned corporation, and renamed as Temasek Tower. It was later acquired by CapitaLand. In April 2007, when the building was still known as Temasek Tower, CapitaLand sold it to MGP Raffle Pte Ltd, and it was renamed as the AXA Tower.

On 6 May 2020, Alibaba Group agreed to buy a 50 per cent stake in AXA Tower, valuing the property at S$1.68 billion.


## Redevelopment

At the beginning of May 2022, AXA Tower was closed to the public for demolition with all tenants having relocated.

On 7 July 2022, plans were approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority for a consortium consisting of Alibaba, Perennial Holdings, and local partners, to redevelop the site of the AXA Tower into a new 63-story building with a height of 1,001 feet (305 metres), making the new building the tallest skyscraper ever approved in Singapore. The mixed-use building, Skywaters Residences, will be mostly made up of office, hotel, and residential spaces, with an observation level and some retail spaces. It is planned to be completed by 2028. The developers have since engaged Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm responsible for the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, to design the new building.
