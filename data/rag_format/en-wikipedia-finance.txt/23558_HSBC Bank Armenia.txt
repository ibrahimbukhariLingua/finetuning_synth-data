# HSBC Bank Armenia



**HSBC Bank Armenia CJSC** (Armenian: Էյչ-Էս-Բի-Սի Բանկ Հայաստան ՓԲԸ-ն) was a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc headquartered in Yerevan, Armenia. The bank provided personal banking and corporate banking services. In 2024, Ardshinbank acquired HSBC Armenia.


## History

HSBC commenced operations in Armenia on March 4, 1996, under the name *Midland Armenia Bank O.J.S.C.* This was the first international bank in the country after the Armenian restoration of independence from the Soviet Union, aiming to bolster confidence in Armenia's financial sector and attract foreign investment.

In 1999, the bank underwent a rebranding, adopting the name HSBC Bank Armenia to align with its parent company's global identity. Initially, HSBC held a 70% ownership stake, with the remaining 30% owned by members of the overseas Armenian business community.

In 2023, HSBC Bank Armenia reported a net profit exceeding 11 billion Armenian drams, served approximately 33,000 customers through 10 offices located in Yerevan and operated 55 ATM machines. It had total assets worth 290 billion Armenian drams and around 200 billion Armenian drams in customer deposits.

In early 2024, HSBC announced its decision to exit the Armenian market after nearly three decades of operation. The bank agreed to sell its subsidiary to Ardshinbank, one of Armenia's leading banks, as part of a strategy to reallocate capital from less strategic or low-growth businesses to areas with higher growth potential globally. In late 2024, HSBC Armenia was the only commercial bank controlled by a major Western banking group in Armenia.

The sale of HSBC Bank Armenia CJSC to Ardshinbank CJSC was completed on 29 November 2024.
