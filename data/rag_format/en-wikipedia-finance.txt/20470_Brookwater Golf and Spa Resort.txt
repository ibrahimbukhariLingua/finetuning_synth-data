## History and development

Planning for the Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort project began in 2012, when Springfield Land Corporation's Chairman Maha Sinnathamby agreed to provide land for the resort development. On October 9, 2014, along with the partners Maxsen World signed a deal with Springfield Land Corporation to build the Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort in Queensland. Initially, the investment in the project was $550 million, later extended to $750 million, which is the largest single foreign investment resort in Australia's history. Maxsen World is a joint venture between World Group in the UK, which has Middle Eastern investors, and Maxsen Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based property management company. Brookwater Resort Investments Pty Limited is the Australian company involved in resort development.

The resort is established on 14 hectares of lands at the centre of Brookwater, Queensland provided by Springfield Land Corporation. Designed by Grounds Kent Architects, the resort development approval was granted by Ipswich City Council in February 2015. Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey gave the Foreign Investment Review Board approval to allow joint venture Maxsen World to invest in the resort. The construction of the resort started in 2016. The project was set to be completed in five stages. The first stage of Brookwater resort construction started at a cost of $110 million which proposed to develop 168 resort apartments with private plunge pools. It also includes the central resort facilities including lobby, lounges, business centre and meeting rooms, ballroom, day spa, gymnasium, restaurants and resort retail, indoor and outdoor recreational and leisure facilities, as well as recreation clubs, a wedding chapel and man-made beach. Greg Norman-designed Brookwater Golf Course is located beside the resort area. Initial infrastructure works have completed over the site and adjoining streets, with services routed around, along and through the golf course.

The Brookwater Golf and Spa Resort hit the market in late April 2015 with Stage 1 achieving $84 million in sales. Local and international buyers have acquired 134 of 168 apartments.
