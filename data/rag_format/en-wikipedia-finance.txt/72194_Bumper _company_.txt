## Platform

Bumper provides a digital payment platform to car dealerships to facilitate transactions related to car repairs which includes open banking. With open banking, customers can pay their bill directly from their account to the garage's account. It's like a bank transfer but you don't need to enter their bank details, you get a notification in your online banking app and approve the payment from there.

A user can receive detailed invoices for repair work, which include options to pay in full or through an interest-free installment plan, similar to other buy now, pay later services.
