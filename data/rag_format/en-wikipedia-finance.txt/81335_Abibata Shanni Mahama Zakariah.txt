Before the 2020 general elections, she was part of those who contested to represent her party, the New Patriotic Party as its parliamentary candidate for the Yendi constituency but lost to Farouk Aliu Mahama, son of late former Vice President of the Republic of Ghana Alhaji Aliu Mahama.

In January 2024, Abibata contested her party's parliamentary primaries, hoping to be second time lucky in her quest to represent her party as its parliamentary candidate for the General Election that year. The internal election was marred by violence leading to the Electoral Commission being unable to call the results in favor of any of the contesting candidates. However, The National Executive of the NPP in April 2024, after having instituted a committee to investigate the primaries, declared incumbent MP, Farouk Aliu Mahama as the Party's Parliamentary Candidate for the Yendi Constituency for Election 2024. Abibata in a statement stated her disagreement with the decision but said she will respect it in the "supreme interest of the party."
