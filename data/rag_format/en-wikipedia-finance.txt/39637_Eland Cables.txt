It specialises in distributing cables used in large civil engineering projects. Its cables are typically used in power and lighting solutions.


## History

Established in 1975, ownership transferred to companies including Unidare before a management buy-out in 2005. Subsequently, the company has achieved approximately £200 million in annual revenue.

Its executive director, Jean-Sebastien Pelland, moved to London from Montreal in 2001 as a finance graduate. He took a role at HW Fisher, a chartered accountancy firm, advising the company in its MBO before joining the board in 2008.
It has supplied the cables for various major infrastructure projects across the UK, including the electrification of the Great Western Main Line.
The company changed its employee remuneration around 2017 due to workforce migration towards Amazon's higher-paying jobs in its South Yorkshire warehouse. In response, the company adjusted its pay structure from the national minimum to a higher living wage, aligning with standards set by the independent Living Wage Foundation. Additionally, it offered a living wage-plus salary, alongside additional benefits such as health insurance coverage for its employees.
From 2020, the company experienced a significant surge in demand and benefitted from private and public sector investment in decarbonisation and digitisation initiatives. In 2022, the company reported a turnover of £200.3 million, a 24% increase from the previous year and a substantial rise from the £107.6 million recorded in 2020. The company attributes this growth to the UK's ambitious efforts to overhaul its energy supply and distribution networks. Additionally, it benefitted from high-growth sectors such as renewable energy, battery storage, mobility and automation.
Eland Cables opened a large cable recycling plant that processes end-of-life cables and their materials. This facility recycles copper, aluminium, and other materials. The recycled materials are used for playground matting. The company recycles its floor sweepings and other site waste and turns non-recyclable materials into biofuel pellets for industrial kilns.
