In 1987 he started working for "Eshed Engineers" and in 1988 joined the founding team of "Aviv Management and Consulting".

Over his 9-year tenure at "Tadiran", he fulfilled a series of managerial positions, including manager of manufacturing planning & control, production manager and operating manager. Upon the acquisition of Tadiran by the US "Carrier" Corporation, he was sent to training at "United Technology", the parent company, and was named operating manager and industrial VP for the group.

In 2000, Zilberman was named president and CEO of "Tedea-Huntleigh", a publicly-traded, multinational company and one of the leaders in its market category, which engages in production and marketing of electromechanical transducers.

In 2007, the venture was acquired by "Mey Eden", with the participation of "TPG Capital", a private equity investment firm and "Och-Ziff", a US hedge fund.

At that time, Zilberman's cost of wage was 15.7 million NIS a year (~2.78 million Euro). A prospectus published by Mey Eden reported that Zilberman's cost of wage at the beginning of 2010 was 82 thousand Euros per month.

In 2014, the Group was acquired by a partnership of US investment fund "Rhône Group" and the Company's management and Zilberman was appointed to CEO. Under his leadership and following the change of ownership, the Group acquired its main competitor in the European market, "Nestle Waters Direct".
