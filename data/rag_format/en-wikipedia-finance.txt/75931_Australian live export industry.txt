Australian live export industry


# Australian live export industry



Australia is the world's largest live exporter of animals for slaughter. The trade involved over three million animals in 2011 valued at approximately A$1 billion, of which the majority were cattle and sheep. However, the live export trade only accounts for 0.4% of all Australian exports, as of 2014ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ. Australia exports live cattle, sheep, goats, dairy cows, buffalo, and alpacas. Cattle comprises 90% of total live exports.

The export of live animals from Australia has generated some controversy, with animal rights organisations such as Animals Australia asking it to be banned on the grounds that certain countries where animals are shipped have no laws to protect them from cruelty. In 2011, the Gillard government briefly suspended the trade and came close to a ban. Exports have since resumed. The Albanese government is planning to phase out the live sheep trade. Australia will stop exporting live sheep from 1 May 2028. The National Farmers' Federation is opposed to the ban claiming it will damage diplomatic relationships.

The industry is regulated under the *Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997* and the *Export Control (Animals) Order 2004*. Since 1985 at least ten government and parliamentary reviews have investigated live exports and its associated animal welfare issues. The first shipments of live sheep were exported from Western Australia to Mauritius and Singapore from 1845.


## Exports

Australia exports live animals to many countries, including Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Russia, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Iran, Bahrain, Qatar, Pakistan, Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and China. A number of ships, mostly converted container ships, move animals from Australia to these countries. Saudi Arabia was historically Australia's largest market for sheep, however it stopped the export due to Australia strict export regulations. 575,000 sheep were exported in 2021, down from a figure of two million in 2017. Indonesia is Australia's largest market for live cattle.

Exports leave via ports at Darwin, Broome and Perth. The loading of stock can take several days. Stocking densities allocate 0.38 metres squared per sheep which means they cannot lay down or easily access food and water.

To ensure animal welfare was maintained observers were deployed to all live export ships. Observers were introduced in April 2018. They monitor heat stress and animal deaths. Observers produce reports on deaths and conditions that are supposed to be published regularly. This program was wound back in 2019 and then halted during the covid-19 pandemic. Observers started monitoring again in May 2022.


### Threats

The live export industry is threatened by lumpy skin disease. If the disease was found in Australian livestock all exports of live cattle, meat and dairy would be halted.
