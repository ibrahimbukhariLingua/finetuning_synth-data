As a trusted advisor for several large corporations, he became an expert in corporate innovation and intrapreneurship.

Cohen has been a board member of numerous companies, including a Swiss Bank, and columnist for various sector newspapers and magazines like Harvard Business Review France, Forbes, L’AGEFI, PME Magazine, Le Temps, etc.

## Academic contributions


### IpOp Model

Cohen created the IpOp Model [fr] as a roadmap for the pre-project/ideation stage of opportunity or project analysis. The model is meant to help innovators analyze and mature their idea to produce an opportunity case or a business plan to convince themselves as well as decision-makers, such as investors or management, of the merits of the opportunity. It has been used by a number of companies for innovative projects including Nestlé, Oracle, Bühler, SICPA and the French Post.


### MicroMBA MB

To help organizations benefit from the innovative potential of their employees Cohen has designed and implemented the MicroMBA MB program. Combining the IpOp Model with the fundamentals taught in an executive MBA, the MicroMBA MB enables middle managers to become proactive agents of change. Participants in the program must identify and implement in groups a real project of their choice that supports the strategy of their employer. These projects translate into a measurable return of investment for the organization, turning training into a profit center.


### Fair and Caring Leadership

Cohen has been one of the first to talk about benevolent (or caring) leadership in an article published in 2013. His additional analysis of the engagement and enforcing rules in organizations led him to develop the concept of Fair and Caring Leadership that he teaches in business school and executive education seminars. His book in French published in 2019 *Les leviers de l’engagement – 54 bonnes pratiques pour entrainer, inspirer et réussir ensemble* outlines the levers for optimizing the level of team engagement.
