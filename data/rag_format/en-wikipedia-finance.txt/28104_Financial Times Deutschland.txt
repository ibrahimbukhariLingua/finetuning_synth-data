Financial Times Deutschland


# Financial Times Deutschland



The ***Financial Times Deutschland*** was a German-language financial newspaper based in Hamburg, Germany, published by Bertelsmann's Gruner + Jahr newspaper and magazine division. The daily contained four sections: Business, Politics & Economy, Finance, and Agenda (Comment, Analysis, Sport, Culture). It ceased publication on 7 December 2012.


## History and profile

*Financial Times Deutschland* was founded at the height of the dot-com bubble on 21 February 2000 as a joint venture between UK *Financial Times* publisher Pearson and Gruner + Jahr. The paper's original editor was Andrew Gowers. Circulation grew to 103,000 readers by the third quarter of 2007, however the paper never turned a profit. At the beginning of 2008 Pearson sold their stake to Gruner + Jahr for €10m and an agreement to receive annual licence fees of €500,000. Following the sale to Gruner + Jahr, the *FT Deutschland* became no longer subject to any editorial control from the *Financial Times*.

The circulations of the daily in 2008, in 2009 and in 2010 were 112,238 copies, 103,276 copies and 103,609 copies, respectively.


## Closure

In November 2012, Gruner + Jahr announced the closure of *Financial Times Deutschland* as part of a restructuring of their economics publishing division, having failed to find a buyer for the title. G + J estimate that the *FTD* made a cumulative loss of €250m over its 12-year life. The last print edition was published on 7 December 2012 displaying an all black front cover featuring the words "Endlich schwarz" ("At last, black" alluding to never having booked a profit since inception). The final issue was named *Final Time Deutschland*. The paper's internet presence was also closed.

The final editor was Steffen Klusmann, who had taken the role on 1 August 2004 following the defection of Christoph Keese to rival *Welt am Sonntag*.

Following the closure, memorabilia from the newspaper was auctioned off, with the proceeds being donated to press freedom advocates Reporters Without Borders.
