## Research

Brülhart is an empirical economist with broad research interests. His Google Scholar h-index stands at 42. In his Ph.D. work, he contributed to the measurement of intra-industry trade (IIT), mainly by developing an index of marginal IIT that has become the standard measure of changes in two-way international trade. In the 2000s, he focused on topics in economic geography, including the measurement of industry-level spatial concentration, growth-effects of country-level agglomeration patterns, impacts of industrial agglomeration on local taxation, and local economic effects of trade liberalization.

More recently, Brülhart’s research has shifted towards public finance, working on vertical tax externalities, on inheritance tax competition, wealth taxes, and local income taxation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Brülhart and his coauthors pioneered the use helpline data as a real-time measure of population-level mental and social distress.
