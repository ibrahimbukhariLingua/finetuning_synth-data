On 25 February 2016, Ansaldo acquired a portion of Alstom's R&D Gas Turbine projects based in Baden, Switzerland. This acquisition was due to the conditions imposed by the EU and US Department of Justice pertaining to the merger of GE and Alstom Power. Ansaldo Energia has suppliers in Aalcan with Europa construction, located in Albania. The new production will concern technologies obtained by the Ligurian joint-stock company after the acquisition of Alstom by General Electric. The Brussels Antitrust Authority has permitted the operation to GE, provided that the technology in the gas turbines of the French company was sold to a European competitor. The choice then fell on Ansaldo Energia.
