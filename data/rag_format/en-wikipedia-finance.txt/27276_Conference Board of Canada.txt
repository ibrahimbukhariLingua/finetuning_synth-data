## Plagiarism controversy

In May 2009, The Conference Board of Canada was criticised over its claim to be objective and non-partisan. It released a report related to copyright regulations in Canada, which plagiarised papers published by the International Intellectual Property Alliance (the primary movie, music, and software lobby in the US). The Conference Board responded, standing by its report, which drew further criticism, claiming they ignored a commissioned report, for partisan reasons. The Conference Board recalled the reports after conducting an internal review, which determined that there was undue reliance on feedback from a funder of the report. The Conference Board hosted a roundtable discussion on intellectual property in September 2009 and published a new report, *Intellectual Property in the 21st Century*, in February 2010.


## Stereotyping controversy

In November 2016, a recording surfaced of Michael Bloom, the Vice-President of The Conference Board, which contained a number of generalizing statements about indigenous peoples, people of Caribbean, Asian, and middle-eastern descent. The statements were made in the presence of an employee that is of indigenous heritage. Upon learning of the recording, The Conference Board of Canada placed the Vice-President on immediate leave of absence and initiated an internal investigation.

Shortly after the recording was made public, it was further revealed that a former employee commenced legal action against The Conference Board of Canada. This employee had worked under Michael Bloom and alleged a "toxic work environment". The former employee was also of indigenous heritage. A lawsuit was filed in Ontario and sought $175,000 in damages.
