# Sony Entertainment



**Sony Entertainment, Inc.** is the umbrella entertainment division of Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony Group Corporation and managed by its American subsidiary, established in 2012 to oversee the corporation's ventures in film, television and music.


## History

On March 30, 2012, then-co-chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures, Michael Lynton, and executive vice president and general counsel of Sony, Nicole Seligman, were respectively named as CEO and president of Sony Corporation of America to oversee all of Sony's global entertainment businesses. On April 9, 2013, Lynton renewed his contract with Sony and was elevated to the presidency at Sony Entertainment.

On February 18, 2016, Seligman resigned after a decade and half with the company but remained there until March 31.

On January 13, 2017, Lynton announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Sony Entertainment and Sony Pictures and chairman of the latter to become chairman for Snap Inc. and was later replaced by Sony Pictures chairman and CEO Anthony Vinciquerra on 11 May 2017.

News outlets including *The New York Post*, *Complete Music Update* and *TheStreet* reported on December 19, 2016, about Sony was considering a restructuring of its American operations by merging Sony Pictures with Sony Interactive Entertainment which would have placed Sony Pictures under Sony Interactive's then-CEO, Andrew House, though House wouldn't have taken over day-to-day operations of Sony Pictures. However, a Sony spokesperson denounced any sort of planned merger or restructuring of any of the Sony media divisions at that time in an interview with the latter source.

Sony announced a merger of Sony Music Entertainment and Sony/ATV Music Publishing to form the umbrella "Sony Music Group" on July 17, 2019, and was finalized on August 1. On February 10, 2021, Sony/ATV Music Publishing reverted to rebranding as Sony Music Publishing.
