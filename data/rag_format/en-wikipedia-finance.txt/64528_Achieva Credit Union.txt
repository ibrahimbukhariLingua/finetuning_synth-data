# Achieva Credit Union



**Achieva Credit Union**, is a state chartered credit union in the United States of America, regulated under the authority of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). On November 1, 2009, Sarasota Coastal Credit Union merged with Achieva Credit Union, which is headquartered in Dunedin, Florida. The credit union has more than $2 billion in assets and more than 160,000 members in 15 counties.


## History

Achieva Credit Union was started as a teachersâ€™ credit union in 1937 in Pinellas County with $99.25. Throughout the years, their field of membership and number of counties served has expanded. The merger is seen as an excellent fit between the two credit unions, as the membership base is similar and the combined field of membership now encompasses counties from Hernando to Charlotte on the West Coast of Florida.

There are 26 branches across their service region.


## Organization

Achieva Credit Union is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors, elected by and from its membership. The Board has nine members, who serve for three-year terms. Board members can be re-elected to consecutive terms by the membership.
