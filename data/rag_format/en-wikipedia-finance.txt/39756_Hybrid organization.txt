Hybrid organization


# Hybrid organization



A **hybrid organization** is an organization that mixes elements, value systems and action logics (e.g. social impact and profit generation) of various sectors of society, i.e. the public sector, the private sector and the voluntary sector. A more general notion of hybridity can be found in Hybrid institutions and governance.

According to previous research hybrids between public and private spheres consist of following features:

1. Shared ownership.
2. Goal incongruence and different institutional logics in the same organisation.
3. Variety in the sources of financing.
4. Differentiated forms of economic and social control.

Value creation in hybrids proceeds through three mechanisms:

1. mixing,
2. compromising,
3. legitimizing.

Mixing distinct value categories may take several forms. One common feature of these forms is the act of combining existing value categories to contribute novel variants of value. Compromising concern solving grievances among the interacting parties. From the legitimization point of view, hybrids are attuned to catering to the demands of multiple audiences: the government, citizens and clients, as well as the competitive markets.

The discussion of relational aspects of hybridity among nodes, dyads and networks raises number of questions. Sometimes governing hybridity necessitates a balancing act among parallel and opposing forces. In other instances, hybridity represents an effort to build genuinely new interaction patterns to settle the issues at hand, but it is also the case that hybridity brings out restrictions on interaction patterns.

The hybridity can be studied across levels of society in micro, meso and macro settings. However, aggregation of institutions follow different patterns within government, business and civil society. The relational aspect appears as integration and separation (node), in dyads between e.g professionals and managers and between providers and beneficiaries, and within networks as actors with different attributes.

Hybrid organization can achieve a competitive advantage because it can easily adapt into rapidly changing business environment. Organizational hybridity refers to an ability to blend features from different organizations or cultures to create solutions which suits organization's needs. In addition, hybrid organizations can achieve long-term sustainability by blending social and economic imperatives and engaging with diverse stakeholder groups.


## Hybrid organizations and knowledge strategies

In hybrid organizations there are private, public and non-profit organizations collaborating together. All these organizations have their own knowledge strategies and the hybrid organization needs to manage a comprehensive knowledge strategy of the entire hybrid organization. This makes the challenges of the hybrid organizations interdependent and multidimensional. In order for a hybrid organization to succeed in creating a knowledge strategy, it must pay attention to the following three things in particular:

* The most critical knowledge assets must be identified.

* The entity responsible for strategic decision-making must be determined, as well as the information on which the decisions are based on.

* A new hybrid organization needs to clearly outline its identity and how to combine the values, goals and organizational cultures of different organizations.

## Performance management in hybrid organizations

Hybridity in organizations, characterized by mixed ownership, governance modes, goal incongruence, and competing institutional logics, presents significant challenges for performance management, both in goal setting and performance measurement. In goal setting, hybrid organizations must balance the diverse interests of stakeholders such as taxpayers, business owners, and donors. The combination of public and private governance structures further complicates goal formation, requiring alignment of diverse electoral and ownership systems. Additionally, goal incongruence leads easily to conflicts over prioritizing public, shareholder, or social value, often necessitating compromises between societal goals and private sector outcomes. Competing institutional logics add another layer of complexity relating to the balance between the effectiveness of market interventions, mission alignment in the voluntary sector, and market performance.

In performance measurement, hybridity demands tailored metrics that reflect the diverse objectives of public, private, and voluntary stakeholders. Measuring success becomes more complex due to the need to track progress toward multiple, sometimes conflicting goals, such as financial returns, social value, and public value. The combination of governance modes places pressure on measurement systems to serve the information needs arising from public elections and share ownership. Goal incongruence further complicates measurement, as conflicts may arise over which metrics best reflect a hybrid organization’s success. Additionally, competing institutional logics require performance systems that assess the market competitiveness of private companies, the effectiveness of government market interventions, and the mission fulfillment of the voluntary sector, while also addressing the motivational needs of employees across all three sectors. Finally, the multiplicity of funding sources—including tax-based, donation-based, and private investment-based models—places pressure on tracking systems to ensure transparency and efficient resource use across these diverse funders.


## Differences between public and private sector

Hybrid organizations are found in both the private and public sectors, but there may be differences in their goals and governance structures: private and public organizations all in all usually have different drivers and organizational structures. Basically public and private sector organizations differ from each other from the point of view of their environment, organization-environment transactions and organizational roles, structures and processes.

In private sector, hybrid organizations are often motivated by profit and create social or environmental value, as a means to achieve financial goals. In contrast, public sector hybrid organizations usually prioritize social or environmental objectives and use financial sustainability as a means to achieve their mission.

Furthermore, public sector hybrid organizations may be subject to more strict regulatory frameworks and may be required to report on a broader range of standards than private sector hybrid organizations.
