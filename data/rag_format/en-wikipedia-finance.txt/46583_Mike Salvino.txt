## Career

Salvino’s first major position was with Andersen Consulting, where he became an associate partner in 1997. He later left the company for Exult Inc. By 2003, he had been promoted to executive vice-president for North American client sales and accounts at Exult, and by April 2004, he was the company’s president for the Americas region.
Before he left for Accenture in 2006, Salvino had been appointed global sales and accounts co-leader for Hewitt's human resources outsourcing group, which had acquired Exult.
