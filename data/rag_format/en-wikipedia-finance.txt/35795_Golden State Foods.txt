## History


### 1947-1999

The company was founded in 1947 by Bill (William) Moore and Frank Streeter and began as a small meat company to supply products to Los Angeles area restaurants and hotels. It is a 100% management-owned and -operated company. In the early 1950s, it started providing meat products to McDonald's Corporation.

On June 12, 1984, GSF employee Samuel Vasquez, 22 years old, was ground to death by a meat grinder in Golden State Foods' City of Industry, California facility when his coworker turned on the machine while he was inside. The machine was able to turn on due to the failure of Golden State Foods to practice lockout–tagout procedures mandated by safety regulations. Their practice was to clean with the machine running as it was slightly easier. California OSHA and the Los Angeles County District Attorney filed a criminal charge against the company over this matter. Golden State Foods pleaded no contest to the criminal charge.
