Pension regulation


# Pension regulation



**Pension regulation** is a legal term encompassing, the set of laws, rules and authoritative standards governing the pension industry, and the procedures needed to enforce them.

Pension regulation varies widely from one jurisdiction to another - notably due to the persistence of discrepancies in the degree of autonomy and breadth of authority and discretionary power that national and regional pension regulators have at their disposal to enforce efficiently existing laws and regulations, in relation with local judicial practices and varying jurisprudential trends.

Pension regulation seeks to provide the various norms and standards needed to foster market efficiency, consistency, transparency and accountability across the pension industry; it is a key driver of pension funds' risk management.

In Europe, in the wake of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, some pension experts such as Anton van Nunen have argued that excessive or misplaced regulatory activism can sometimes have negative unintended consequences, notably when it comes to the strict enforcement of asset liability matching in times high market volatility and the systematic use of bonds-based risk metrics across all asset classes.
