In 1972 Indian Copper Corporation Limited, Private Sector Company, located at Ghatsila, Jharkhand with Smelter and Refinery was Nationalized and made part of HCL. Hindustan Copper Limited developed Malanjkhand Copper Project in Madhya Pradesh, the largest hard rock Open pit mine in the country which was dedicated to the nation on 12 November 1982. Further in 1990 a Continuous Cast Wire Rod plant of South Wire Technology was commissioned at Taloja in Maharashtra.


## Services

HCL also produces gold, silver, nickel sulphate, selenium, tellurium and fertiliser as by products. It is the first Indian Copper Producer to be accredited with ISO 9002 certification for Continuous Cast Rod Manufacturer at its Taloja Plant and for manufacture of cathode at its refineries both at Indian Copper Complex, Ghatsila, Jharkhand and Khetri Copper Complex, Khetri, Rajasthan

Hindustan Copper Limited is engaged in mining and smelting of copper, having its production facilities and offices at various locations across the country.

## Units


### Khetri Copper Complex

Located in the state of Rajasthan, 180 km (110 mi) from Delhi

* Capacity - 31,000 tpa copper cathode (the smelter and acid plant at KCC are under shutdown since late 2008 due to the slump in global commodity prices witnessed in 2008 and old machinery. Currently, only concentrator for production of copper concentrate is working in addition to associated mines.)
* By-products- sulphuric acid
* Mines - Khetri and Kolihan (producing 9,500 mt metal in concentrate / annum)
* Reserve
 + Khetri 34.56 million tonnes @ 1.13% cu
 + Kolihan 22.45 million tonnes @ 1.33% cu
 + Banwas 24.97 million tonnes @ 1.69% cu

### Indian Copper Complex

Located in the state of Jharkhand

* Capacity 16,500 tpa copper cathode
* By products Sulfuric acid, gold, silver, palladium, selenium, tellurium, nickel sulphate
* Mines - Surda
* Reserve
 + Surda 19.30 million tonnes @1.17% cu

### Malanjkhand Copper Project

Located in Madhya Pradesh 200 km (120 mi) from Jabalpur, 170 km (110 mi) from Raipur

* Capacity open cast mine with a capacity of 2 million tonnes with matching concentrator
* Mines - Malanjkhand Open-pit mining
* Reserve 208.030 million tonnes @1.3% cu
* Features of the open pit mine
 + length 2600 meter
 + Width 700 meter
 + Planned depth: 240 meter below average ground level

The open pit mine has reached ultimate pit depth and further it's not economically viable to exploit the mineral with open pit mining, Hence the mine is being converted to underground mines with enhanced capacity of 5 million tonnes with an investment to the tune of 2000 crores.


### Taloja Copper Project

Located in the state of Maharashtra, district-Raigad, 60 km (37 mi) from Mumbai

* Capacity 60,000 tpa continuous cast copper rod - hindcop rods
* Technology plant is based on the latest 'southwire technology'
* Product range 8 mm, 11 mm, 12.5 mm, 16 mm and 19 mm cc rod
