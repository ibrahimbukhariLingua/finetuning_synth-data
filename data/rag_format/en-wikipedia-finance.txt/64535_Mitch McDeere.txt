**Mitchell Y. McDeere** is a fictional character and the protagonist of John Grisham's 1991 novel *The Firm*. Mitch McDeere is a Harvard-educated tax lawyer who has a certified public accountant credential. He is also the husband of Abby McDeere, a Western Kentucky University–educated elementary school teacher. The character was portrayed by Tom Cruise in the 1993 film adaptation of the novel, and most recently by Josh Lucas for Entertainment One Television's show also named *The Firm*.

Mitch McDeere’s story picks up in Grisham’s 2023 novel, “The Exchange”, which is set 15 years after the events in “The Firm”.


## General background

He is regarded as "an old-school, self-made hero" by *Entertainment Weekly* critic Melissa Maerz. The novel sold 7 million copies and the movie, which starred Tom Cruise, grossed over $158 million ($333 million in 2013 dollars) domestically and $111 million internationally ($270 million worldwide in 1993 dollars). Additionally, it was the largest grossing R-rated movie of 1993 and of any film based on a Grisham novel. The film was released while Grisham was at the height of his popularity. That week, Grisham and Michael Crichton evenly divided the top six paperback spots on The New York Times Best Seller list.

Both the novel and the film recount the story of an upstart attorney who was hired out of college by Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a small tax firm in Memphis that is really part of the white-collar crime division of an organized crime family's enterprise. After graduating third in his Harvard Law School class, he became a whistleblower to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and brought down both the firm and the crime family. The TV series begins as the McDeere family emerges from witness protection to encounter old and new challenges. The television show picks up on the story of McDeere and his family ten years after the events of the novel.

His father had been a coal miner and his mother was a waitress. In high school, Mitch had been a star quarterback with several scholarship offers. He injured his knee in his last high school game, and the only school that upheld its scholarship offer was Western Kentucky University. He matriculated and played quarterback as an infrequent starter, while making straight A's and earning a degree in accounting. He and his wife Abby were high school sweethearts who got married after they graduated from Western Kentucky. While Mitch was in law school, she taught kindergarten. They are Methodist. In the novel, he had driven a Mazda hatchback prior to being offered a BMW to work at Bendini. In the novel, his remarried mother lived in a trailer park in Panama City Beach, but he had been raised by his brother Ray.
