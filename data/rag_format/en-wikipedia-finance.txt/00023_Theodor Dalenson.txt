## Conservation Involvement

Since 1984, Dalenson has helped reorganize and protect the Atlantic Salmon fisheries in general and especially on the Alta river in Norway after the hydro dam construction in Sautso. After being one of the head witnesses in the compensation matters against Statskraft, the hydro company on the Alta river, he spent the rest of the 1990s directing Alta towards the introduction of conservation efforts and catch limits as well as catch and release in all parts of the river. He later helped syndicate the sport fishing on the Alta River and worked as an advisor to three chairmen of the ALI, Osvad Möllers, Lyon Holten, and Ivar Leinan, to help establish Alta as the foremost Atlantic salmon sport fishery in the world. He is the co-author of three books on the history of sport fishing on the Alta River. In the 1990s, he produced a documentary film about fishing on the Alta River named Alta the River, directed by Arne Naevra.

In 1993, his contributions helped start the first collection of historical artifacts at the Alta Museum (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). Theodor was elected to the board of the Atlantic Salmon Federation (US) and co-founded the North Atlantic Fund together with Orri Vigfusson in 1992.
