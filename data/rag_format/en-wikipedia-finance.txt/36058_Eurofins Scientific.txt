## History

Eurofins Scientific was founded in 1987 with 4 employees. Eurofins derived the "fins" of its name from the French version of SNIF-NMR: Fractionnement Isotopique Naturel Spécifique par Résonance Magnétique Nucléaire or FINS-RMN. During this start up period (1987 to 1997), the SNIF-NMR patent was registered.

From 1997, Eurofins' strategy was to acquire state-of-the-art laboratories with unique technologies, scientific expertise and potential for global growth. As Eurofins' revenues reached €7 million, its IPO on the Paris Stock Exchange helped fund the organization's rapid geographic expansion. The network expanded to eight new countries and grew to include over 50 laboratory sites. Leading positions were built up in core markets (Food Testing, BioPharma Product Testing and Environment Testing) and key segments such as genomics and contaminant testing.

In 2001, Eurofins developed Eurofins TAG, a system that uses genetic markers to trace meat products to individual animals to ensure consumer products are free of BSE.

From 2002, Eurofins started developing its infrastructure. It structured its laboratories as independent, entrepreneur-led companies, which eventually achieved global leadership positions in several key areas.

Eurofins completed close to 60 acquisitions in 2017 and close to 50 acquisitions in 2018, and became a €4 billion company.

In September 2021, Eurofins announced that Eurofins Scientific would be included in the CAC 40 Index.
