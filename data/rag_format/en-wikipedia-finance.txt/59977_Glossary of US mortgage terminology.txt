## Mortgage types

* Adjustable rate mortgage or ARM - A mortgage where the interest rate adjusts relative to a specified index + margin. E.g. COFI, LIBOR etc.
* Hybrid ARM - An adjustable rate mortgage where the initial 'start' rate is fixed for some portion of time (3,5,7, or 10 years) thereafter the interest rate adjusts (yearly or bi-annually) based on the sum of a specified index + margin. E.g. 2/28 Arm, 3/1 Arm, 5/1 Arm, 7/1 Arm, 10/1 Arm, 3/6month arm, etc...
* Fixed rate mortgage or FRM - A mortgage where the interest rate and payment are fixed for the term of the loan.
* Negative amortization mortgage - where the payment may be less than the monthly accrued interest, and the outstanding interest is capitalized monthly into the loan balance.
* Balloon payment mortgage - A mortgage most commonly used in commercial real estate. The Balloon payment mortgage does not fully amortize over the term of the note, which leaves a balance due at maturity, known as a "balloon payment."
* Interest only mortgage - A type of mortgage where the borrower pays only the accruing interest on the principal balance. These payments on interest leave the principal balance unchanged.
