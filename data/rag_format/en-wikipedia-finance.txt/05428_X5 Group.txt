The company's global depositary receipts are listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and the Moscow Stock Exchange (MSE).

## Offline-retail formats

Each of the Company’s brands offers a unique customer value proposition and targets key parts of the Russian consumer population.

### Pyaterochka

Pyaterochka is a retail chain of proximity food stores.

Pyaterochka launched a new store refurbishment program in 2019.

Vegetables, fruits and some of the perishable items are laid out in the dedicated fresh zone. On top of that, the rebranded Pyaterochka sells a wide assortment of foods to go and ready-to-eat meals and has a special area where customers can have coffee or fresh orange juice and charge their gadgets.

### Perekrestok

Perekrestok is a retail chain of food supermarkets.

In February 2020 Perekrestok has begun the roll-out of new store concept. Among the highlights of the new concept are updated interior and exterior designs, and a selection of new services offered in-store. The new Perekrestok concept is designed to meet the needs of today's customers, including frequent purchases of ready-to-eat and ready-to-go products. About 50% of the selling space will be dedicated to fresh categories (fruits, vegetables, dairy products, cheese, deli meats, as well as fresh fish and meat) or salad bars, bakeries and cafés.

For the project, the company developed its own software covering all the project’s operational and auxiliary processes. The IT system is integrated into the Х5 Retail Group infrastructure, allowing new stores to be hooked up to the service in just a few hours and goods balances to be monitored virtually in real time. There is a patented system operating for collecting orders at a store; this cuts assembly time considerably and optimises staff work. As of April 2020, the service was live in Moscow, Skhodnya, Lyubertsy and Kazan.

The **Perekrestok.Bystro** express delivery service was started up in 2020, with orders being collected at Perekrestok supermarkets. The software is similar to the IT system used by the Dostavka.Pyaterochka service. As of April 2020, the service was operating in Moscow.


### 5Post

5Post is a subdivision of X5 Retail Group, a developing service for delivering orders from online stores and marketplaces to the company’s stores. In the summer of 2018, the subdivision started opening the first lockers and order collection points.

In June 2019, X5 Retail Group and the Unitrade customs broker developed an end-to-end service for foreign online stores. Partners pick up orders from the online store warehouses in China, bring them to Russia, clear them through customs and deliver them to the X5 distribution centre in Novosibirsk. Then 5Post delivers the parcels to stores.

At the end of 2019, 5Post was managing 12 sorting facilities at Х5 Retail Group distribution centres and 8,000 postamats and order collection points. During 2019, over five million parcels were delivered to clients.
