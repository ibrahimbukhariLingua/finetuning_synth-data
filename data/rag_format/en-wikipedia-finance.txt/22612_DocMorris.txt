## History

Zur Rose was founded in 1993 by the present chairman of the Board of Directors Walter Oberh√§nsli and a group of medical doctors as wholesale suppliers for self-dispensing doctors in Switzerland. The former company name derived from the house *Zur Rose* in Steckborn, Switzerland, where the first stationary pharmacy of the company was opened. From it, doctors from the region were supplied with medicines. In 1999, the company moved from Steckborn to its current headquarters in Frauenfeld.

In 2009 the pharmaceutical company Helvepharm AG was sold to Sanofi Aventis. In 2012, Zur Rose acquired Europe's largest online pharmacy DocMorris and in 2019 with medpex, the third-largest online pharmacy of Germany. Further acquisitions in pharma logistics and online commerce were Ogera AG (2001), Helvepharm AG (2006), DocMorris (2012), Eurapon Pharmahandel GmbH (2017), Promofarma (2018) and apo-rot (2018). The group also acquired two software companies; BlueCare AG (2015) and TeleClinic (2020), a telemedicine provider.

Zur Rose Group IPOed on the SIX Swiss Exchange on July 6, 2017. Since 2017 Zur Rose Group operates in Switzerland a small number of physical shop-in-shop stores in collaboration with Switzerland's largest retailer Migros.

In 2022, the medpex brand was integrated at the Heerlen location and capacity more than doubled. The logistics site in Bremen was closed at the same time and the Eurapon brand discontinued.

In May 2023, the Zur Rose Switzerland business was sold to the Migros subsidiary Medbase. Following this event Zur Rose Group AG was renamed DocMorris AG and the stock market ticker symbol was changed from ROSE to DOCM.
