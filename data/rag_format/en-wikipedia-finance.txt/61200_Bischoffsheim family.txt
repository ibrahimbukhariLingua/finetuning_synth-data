Bischoffsheim family


# Bischoffsheim family



The **Bischoffsheim family** is a family of German-Belgian Jewish descent known for their success in banking. It can be traced back to Raphaël Nathan Bischoffsheim, an army contractor native of Tauberbischofsheim, in the Electorate of Mainz. The family was particularly interwoven with the Goldschmidt family of Frankfurt am Main; the two families intermarried over the generations and jointly managed Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt & Cie bank, which they eventually merged into Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas in 1863.
