The company is headquartered in Hungary, Europe, with several subsidiaries and affiliates around the world, including Austria, Bulgaria, Singapore and the United States.


## History and overview

Cellum is a corporate group that comprises several privately held companies. The first company was founded in 2000 by Balázs Inotay under the name Enigma Software Inc. and focused on developing SIM-based cryptography and digital signature technology. The company was renamed to Cellum Innovations and Services Inc. and was moved under the Netherlands-based holding company Cellum BV, with a view to international expansion. A new company called Mobile Payment Provider Inc. was set up for operating the company group's infrastructure. At the same time, Cellum shifted its focus to providing mobile banking and carrier billing solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ to the market-leading mobile carriers in Hungary.

In 2010, former Minister of Economy and Transport Dr. János Kóka joined Cellum first as an advisor, and then in 2011 he became CEO of the newly created Cellum Global Inc. affiliate, focusing on bringing Cellum's technologies to international markets. That same year, to support this expansion, Cellum Global received a EUR 1.5 million capital injection from PortfoLion, the venture fund of OTP Bank, at the time representing the largest such investment in Central Europe.

On January 30, 2018, Cellum announced that Indonesia's partly state-owned telecommunications company Telkom Indonesia, through its PT MetraNet subsidiary, was making an investment in the company in two phases, eventually acquiring a 30.4% stake. Though the scale of the capital injection was not disclosed at the time, citing capital market rules, it was later reported by Indonesian press that the total value of the transaction was USD 6 million.
