United City


# United City



**United City** is a group of businesses based within Greater Manchester, England, who supported proposals for congestion charging in Greater Manchester via the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund bid for £3 billion. The bid was rejected by a referendum on 12 December 2008. Had the proposal been passed, it would have been the United Kingdom's largest public transport investment in history outside London. United City had over 226 registered companies as of 19 November 2008.


## Background and history


### Aim, conditions and demands

Two quotes from United City explained their aims. 'A statement from United City said it would “represent all forward-thinking companies and organisations which understand that the economic future of Greater Manchester depends on a sustainable road and public transport system and that a world-class integrated network will hugely improve the city region's competitive advantage in the global marketplace.” '

'Ken Knott, chief executive of Ask Developments, said: "United City wants to win (Greater Manchester’s) bid for a world-class public transport network for a world-class city region. We agree with the public authorities that doing nothing is not an option.” '

Their demands were :-

* A cap of only one charge for business vehicles passing through a charging ring more than once during the charging periods. This will help businesses which, for example, have to make peak-time deliveries across the M60 and inner charging rings. *This has been met*
* An exemption for Trafford Park from any charge until the Metrolink line is completed. *A 50% discount is currently purposed*
* An exemption for motorcycles. *This has been met*
* All excess income from congestion charging to be ring-fenced wholly for spending on public transport in Greater Manchester. *This has been met*

These were in addition to the following conditions set down by United City :-

* The great majority of the public transport improvements outlined within the TIF proposals must be in place before a congestion charge is introduced. *80% has promised to be in place*
* The congestion charge must only be active when congestion causes the economy the greatest cost (during the early morning and evening rush hours). *The charge will only be at peak times on weekdays*
* The income from congestion charging is ring-fenced to service only repayments for the capital loan from central government, for investment in and support of public transport in Greater Manchester. *This has been met*
* An independent individual or body must be in place to oversee the public transport investment and the implementation of the congestion charge.
