Bulgarian Stock Exchange


# Bulgarian Stock Exchange



The **Bulgarian Stock Exchange** (Bulgarian: Българска фондова борса, Romanized: *Bulgarska fondova borsa*), or **BSE**, is the sole licensed and operating stock exchange in Bulgaria. It was founded on 10 October 1991.

The BSE is 50.5% owned by the Bulgarian government, which is actively seeking potential investors, some of them being the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Athens Stock Exchange, OMX, and the Prague Stock Exchange.

The exchange has a pre-market session from 9:00 am to 9:20 am, regular trading hours from 9:20 am to 1:45 pm, and a post-market session from 1:45 pm to 4:00 pm on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.


## History

The original exchange, the Sofia Stock Exchange, which had been established by a tsar's decree in 1914, ceased to operate after the Second World War as Bulgaria became a communist state.

BSE's first index, the SOFIX, was created in October 2000, followed by three additional indices over the years.

In January 2011, the stock exchange itself (Symbol: BSO) was added to regular market trading.

In June 2018, the name of the exchange was shortened from 'Bulgarian Stock Exchange – Sofia' to 'Bulgarian Stock Exchange'.

In August 2023, the company formed EuroCTP as a joint venture with thirteen other bourses in an effort to provide a consolidated tape for the European Union as part of the Capital Markets Union proposed by the European Commission.
