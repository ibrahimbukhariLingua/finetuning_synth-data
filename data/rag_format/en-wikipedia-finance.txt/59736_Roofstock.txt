## Roofstock Neighborhood Rating Algorithm

Roofstock launched a “neighborhood rating algorithm,” that analyzes more than 72,000 Census tracts and ranks their risk. It includes factors like home values, average rent, income levels, employment rates, education levels, crime data, percentage of owner-occupied homes and school district ratings. Also, it ranks each neighborhood on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being the most risky.
