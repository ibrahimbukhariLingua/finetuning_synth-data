UNO Shopping


# UNO Shopping



The **UNO Shopping** was a shopping mall in Leonding, Upper Austria and is located southwest of Linz. It was opened on 16 October 1990. In 2007, the mall had a revenue of 145 Million Euro. Since July 2012, the mall is empty with the exception of an apothecary and a consumer electronic retailer in an external part of the complex.


## Criticism

One point of criticism was, that purchasing power was transferred away from the city center of Linz. Another one was the enormous volume of traffic produced by several other businesses along Kremstal A-Road, one of the main routes entering Linz.
