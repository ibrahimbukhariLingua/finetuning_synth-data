## Political activity

During 2020–21 Belarusian protests that followed rigged elections, PandaDoc founders offered financial aid and professional retraining (in the tech industry) to the police officers who had lost their jobs because of refusing to illegally suppress protesters. In retaliation, on September 2, 2020, the Minsk office was raided by the authorities, more than a hundred employees were questioned, 7 were detained. A criminal case was opened against four of them. Three of the arrested were conditionally released later that autumn; the last remaining person under arrest, product manager Victor Kunshinov, was released in August 2021. He spent more than 1 year in prison. On 31 August 2021, the authorities of Belarus announced that the case against PandaDoc was closed after the defendants admitted their guilt and compensated the alleged damage.
