Chief Investment Officer Magazine


# Chief Investment Officer Magazine



***Chief Investment Officer Magazine*** (formerly ***aiCIO***) was an English-language international finance magazine. It is now just a website owned by Strategic Insight. In 2009, the magazine was honored with Folio's Silver Ozzie Award for "Best Design New Magazine, B-to-B". In 2011, the magazine was a finalist for the Jesse H. Neal Award, in the category recognizing Best Subject-Related Series of Articles for their entry, "Interrogations". *CIO Magazine'*s work has also been excerpted in *The Atlantic* and referenced in *New York Magazine*.

The target readership for the magazine includes chief investment officers and senior investment professionals. The print and digital publication reports news, opinion, and research focusing on investment issues affecting pension, insurance, and sovereign wealth funds, as well as endowments and foundations. *CIO* is headquartered in New York City.


## Organizational history

Asset International was acquired in January 2009, by venture capital firm, Austin Ventures which sold to Genstar Capital in July 2014. Following the first acquisition, the firm was relocated from Connecticut to Manhattan. Offices are located in New York City, Hong Kong, Melbourne, London, and Stamford, Connecticut. The magazine changed its name to *aiCIO* from *ai5000* in late 2010, to describe its audience by function (chief investment officers), as opposed to size (the 5,000 largest funds in the world, with the cutoff being around $1 billion), and again to *CIO* in 2014. The magazine is the sister publication of *Global Custodian*, *PLANSPONSOR*, *planadvisor*, and *aiTrade*. Leanna Orr took over for Paula Vasan as Managing Editor in March of 2013.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Elizabeth Pfeuti serves as *CIO's* European Editor.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
