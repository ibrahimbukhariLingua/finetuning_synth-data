## Work

Mauderer is responsible for the implementation of the European Central Bankâ€™s monetary policy in Germany by Deutsche Bundesbank. She believes that capital markets play an important role in financing the sustainable and digital transformation of the economy in Germany and Europe. Mauderer has argued that public-private partnerships can be a feasible way to mobilise funds for the transition. Mauderer has also made the case for more openness of businesses in Germany and supports a European capital markets union. Mauderer has also argued that central banks need to address climate change because it poses risks to financial stability, and she sees central banks as catalysts to make the financial system greener.
