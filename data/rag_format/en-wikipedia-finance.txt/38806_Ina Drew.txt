**Ina R. Drew** is a former high-ranking executive on Wall Street. She was the chief investment officer for JPMorgan Chase before resigning after the company suffered a trading loss of $9 billion in April/May 2012.

Drew grew up in Springfield Township, New Jersey.

"Until the loss was disclosed late Thursday [May 10, 2012], Drew was considered by some market participants as one of the best managers of balance-sheet risks.

She earned a master's degree in international economics from the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.
