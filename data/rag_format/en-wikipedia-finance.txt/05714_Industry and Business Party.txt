Industry and Business Party


# Industry and Business Party



The **Industry and Business Party** (Norwegian: *Industri- og Næringspartiet*, INP) is a Norwegian political party founded at Vemork in Rjukan on 29 February 2020. The party describes itself as a centre-oriented moderate party, with the slogans "Stability and predictability", "Development, not liquidation" and will, among other things, work to prevent a restriction of the oil and gas industry and better framework conditions for business in general. On 1 February 2023, the Health Party formally started the merging process with the Industry and Business Party.


## Party program and ideology

The party program was drawn up based on proposals from members of the party's Facebook group.

INP calls itself a centre-oriented moderate party with values from both the right and left in the political landscape.

The party denies the scientific consensus on climate change, describing it as hysteria and saying any change is not caused by humans.


## Electoral results

The party collected the necessary 5,000 signatures from eligible Norwegians and was registered as a national political party by the Brønnøysund Register Centre on 6 May 2020. INP presented lists in all counties for the first time in the 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election.
