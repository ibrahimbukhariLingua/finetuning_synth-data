# Central Bank of Belize



The **Central Bank of Belize** is the central bank of Belize, established in 1982. In 2021 Gustavo Manuel Vasquez was chosen to serve as Governor, replacing A. Joy Grant, who had served in the role since 2016.


## History

The Central Bank of Belize was established on January 1, 1982, by the Central Bank of Belize Act No. 15 (Chapter 262 of the Laws of Belize Revised Edition 2000).

The Central Bank is the natural successor to the Monetary Authority of Belize, established from 1976 to 1981, and the Board of Commissioners of Currency running from 1894. The latter is responsible for the devaluation crisis that led to the nationalist movement of the 1950s.
