Swiss Formula


# Swiss Formula



The **Swiss Formula** is a mathematical formula designed to cut and harmonize tariff rates in international trade. Several countries are pushing for its use in World Trade Organization trade negotiations. It was first introduced by the Swiss Delegation to the WTO during the current round of trade negotiations at the WTO, the Doha Development Round or more simply the Doha Round. Something similar was used in the Tokyo Round.

The aim was to provide a mechanism where maximum tariffs could be agreed, and where existing low tariff countries would make a commitment to some further reduction.


## Details

The formula is of the form

where

So for example, a value *A* of 25% might be negotiated. If a very high tariff country has a rate *T*ₒₗd of 6000% then its *T*ₙₑw rate would be about 24.9%, almost the maximum of 25%. Somewhere with an existing tariff *T*ₒₗd of 64% would move to a *T*ₙₑw rate of about 18%, rather lower than the maximum; one with a rate *T*ₒₗd of 12% would move to a *T*ₙₑw rate of about 8.1%, substantially lower than the maximum. A very low tariff country with a rate *T*ₒₗd of 2.3% would move to a *T*ₙₑw rate of about 2.1%.

Mathematically, the Swiss formula has these characteristics:

1. As *T*ₒₗd tends to infinity, *T*ₙₑw tends to *A*, the agreed maximum tariff
2. As *T*ₒₗd tends to 0, *T*ₙₑw tends to *T*ₒₗd i.e. no change in tariffs as it is already low
3. When *T*ₒₗd is equal to *A*, the maximum, then *T*ₙₑw is half of *A*. Thus the maximum tariff which is agreed is cut in half.

## Criticisms

It has been arguedᵇʸ ʷʰᵒᵐ? however that the formula is too simple for use in tariff negotiations and that it does not lead to proportionate reduction in tariffs across all countries. It is because of this that those who believe an "ideal formula" exist are still looking for the ideal formula, with the Koreans having already suggested an alternative formula, though it has not yet been adopted nor is there any proof that an ideal formula exists.
