# Orange Austria



**Orange Austria** was an Austrian mobile network operator. It started its business on 26 October 1998 as owner of the third GSM license of the country, and the first provider operating in the GSM 1800 band. Since 2004, Orange (previously known as *ONE*) successfully applied for a UMTS-License and offers since 2005 also UMTS Services. ONE's logo was a blue circle. It was rebranded as Orange on 22 September 2008.

With 1.9 million customers (including approximately 180,000 Tele2mobil customers) it is Austria's third largest provider with a market share of 20%. Orange cooperates with UPC Telekabel (a Liberty Global company) for landline and ISP offers.

On 3 February 2012, Hutchison Whampoa announced that it would buy all of Orange Austria for US$1.7 billion. The deal closed on 3 January 2013. The combined business created a mobile carrier with 2.8 million customers and more than 20% market share in Austria. The Orange brand continued to operate in Austria until August 19, 2013, when its operations were merged into 3.
