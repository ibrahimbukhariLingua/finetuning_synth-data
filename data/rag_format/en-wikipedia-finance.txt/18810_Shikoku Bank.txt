## Seppuku pledge

In November 2024, screenshots of the bank's pledge on its website went viral. According to the bank's website, 23 employees, including President Miura, have signed a blood-stamped document vowing to commit *seppuku* if they are found guilty of engaging in financial irregularities, embezzlement or other fraudulent activities. The pledge reads, "Anyone employed by this bank who has stolen money or caused others to steal from the bank will pay for it with his or her property and then commit suicide". The pledge was a custom from their predecessor bank, 37th National, since 1878.
