## Research

Connolly's body of research comprises journal articles and books.
He wrote World Bank reports on trade liberalization, financial reform, and macroeconomic issues in countries like Uzbekistan, Kenya, and Argentina from 1985 to 1996. In his early research, he used the Girton-Roper model to analyze exchange market pressure in postwar Brazil and later classified fixed exchange rate regimes in 94 countries, examining their impact on monetary policy and crawling pegs with Latin American examples. With Dean Taylor, he modelled the exact timing of a speculative attack against a fixed exchange rate regime when domestic credit grows faster than the demand for money.
