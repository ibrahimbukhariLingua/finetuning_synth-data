In May 2023, it was noted that B. Riley paid a dividend yield of nearly 11% which was much higher than its peers.

In the report the audit cited multiple material weaknesses in the company’s reporting, and some of the previously reported data was revised. It also noted concerns about the fraud case involving Kahn but stated B. Riley had no ties to it after it redid an internal investigation with the help of Winston & Strawn.

In August 2024, Bryant Riley made an unsolicited offer to take the company private at $7.00 per share, a 39% premium to the stock closing price the day the offer was made, though significantly lower than the $17 per share the stock was trading at one week prior.
