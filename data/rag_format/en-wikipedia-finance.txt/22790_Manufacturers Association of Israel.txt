## History

In 1921 the *Association of Manufacturers and Employers* was founded by a group of Jewish industrialists, led by Arie Shenkar, during the British Mandate for Palestine period. This association broke up after four years and then the *Association of Manufacturers in the Land of Israel* was founded, which was later renamed *Manufacturers Association of Israel*. The main objectives of the association were “to help factory owners raise capital, work together as a group in dealing with workers’ union, and contend with the authorities in matters related to taxes, levies, import restrictions, etc.” However, the primary objective was to “promote the dream of a flourishing Zionist industry” in the creation of the State of Israel. Nowadays, the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel’s main objectives are to continue developing industry in Israel, protecting and promoting the interest of manufacturers who are members of the MAI, and positioning the MAI as an innovative organization that initiates change, takes the lead on issues affecting the private sector, and influences the economy and society in the State of Israel.
