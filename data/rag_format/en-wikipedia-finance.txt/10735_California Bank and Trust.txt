# California Bank and Trust



**California Bank & Trust** (**CB&T**) is a full-service bank specializing in consumer, commercial and wealth management services headquartered in San Diego, California. With more than 80 branches located across California and assets totaling about $91 billion, CB&T is a subsidiary of Zions Bancorporation, one of the nation's top 50 bank holding companies.


## History

California Bank & Trust was created in October 1998 as the result of the merger of three institutions acquired separately by Zions Bancorporation: Sumitomo Bank of California, San Diego–based Grossmont Bank, and First Pacific National Bank.

The institution continued to grow with the acquisition of Fresno, California–based Regency Bank in 1999. In 2001, the company expanded its footprint with the addition of Eldorado Bancshares, which included Eldorado's two subsidiaries, Eldorado Bank and Antelope Valley Bank.

Other acquisitions include Alliance Bank and Vineyard Bank, which were acquired when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) closed those institutions in 2009. Through this transaction, California Bank & Trust acquired Alliance Bank's $951 million of deposits and $1.14 billion of assets, and up to $225 million of the sold bank's credits.


## Operations

California Bank & Trust operates through a network of more than 80 branches run through four administrative offices. The offices include Irvine, Los Angeles, Oakland, and the bank's main headquarters in San Diego.
