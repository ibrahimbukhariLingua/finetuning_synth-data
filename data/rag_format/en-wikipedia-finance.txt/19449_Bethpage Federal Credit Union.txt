## History

**Grumman Hangar 2 Credit Union** was opened for employees of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation on October 28, 1941. Having been initially formed in Farmingdale, Grumman had moved to Bethpage by the time the credit union was separated in 1994, thus changing its name to **Bethpage Federal Credit Union**. In 2003, Bethpage was approved for the largest federal community charter in the U.S., allowing its rapid growth.

In November 2024, Bethpage announced it would be rebranding and changing its name to **FourLeaf Federal Credit Union** in early 2025.


## Community involvement

Bethpage FCU has extensive ties to the communities it serves. For many years, Bethpage FCU has sponsored the Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach. In 2010, Bethpage FCU signed a 10-year contract to sponsor the Suffolk County Sports Park in Central Islip, known as Bethpage Ballpark under their sponsorship (now known as Fairfield Properties Ballpark), home of the Long Island Ducks. Bethpage FCU agreed in 2014 to sponsor the football stadium at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University, where they have also established a high-tech branch for the students and faculty of the school.
