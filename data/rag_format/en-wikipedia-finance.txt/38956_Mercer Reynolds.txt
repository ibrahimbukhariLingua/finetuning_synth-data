Bush. Reynolds was later an investor with Bush in the Texas Rangers baseball team. From 1985 to 2001, he was CEO of Reynolds Plantation, a golf community near Lake Oconee in Georgia.

Reynolds was the Ohio finance chairman for the George W. Bush 2000 presidential campaign, raising over $600,000, and was named to co-chair Bush's inaugural committee.
