## Production and release

The movie is based on the experiences of Nigerians during the 2016 MMM online scheme which promised 30% returns on investment. The scheme inadvertently crashed and put subscribers in distress. In an interview, the movie’s producer, said the project was aimed at sensitising Nigerians to avoid get-rich-quick schemes. It was shot in Lagos but set in Ota, Ogun State.

The movie voice technique was employed as Uzo Aniunoh was both an actress and a narrator. This technique has been used in movies like *Fight Club* and *Memento*.


## Reception

In a review for *Nigerian Entertainment Today*, Jerry Chiemeke wrote "The only way for the audience to enjoy this film is to close their eyes to its technical flaws – and they are many. They will probably laugh (a lot), but in the end, a good film transcends giggles, and when it comes down to categorising Nollywood films, this will not be one of the exactly memorable ones." He rated the film a 6/10.
