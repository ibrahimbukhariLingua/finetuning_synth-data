**Sir Ian Clark Wood** (born 21 July 1942) is a Scottish billionaire businessman and philanthropist.

He served as Wood Group's chief executive from 1967 to 2006, and as chairman until 2012. Wood is one of Scotland's wealthiest people, with an estimated net worth of around £1.7 billion (2020).

In 2007, Wood and his immediate family set up The Wood Foundation – a venture philanthropy organisation.

In April 2010, Aberdeen City Council accepted his conditional investment of up to £85m (£50m confirmed, £35m pledged should the project exceed its budget), towards a project of £140m to redesign the Union Terrace Gardens, The project was supported by some local businesses though opposed by a large number of local residents.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The Union Terrace Gardens project was passed by referendum but was later rejected by the council.

## Chancellor of Robert Gordon University

Wood spent 16 years as head of Robert Gordon University, stepping down in 2021. In 2010 Donald Trump was awarded an honorary degree from the university. This provoked considerable opposition and the degree was removed after Dr David Kennedy returned his own degree in protest and journalist/campaigner Suzanne Kelly's petition opposing the award was signed by approximately 80,000 people. who felt Trump's behaviour was contrary to RGU's values.


## Corporate tax arrangements

In 2011, Wood Group transferred North Sea staff to a company in a tax haven apparently to avoid employer national insurance contributions, a move criticised by Scottish politicians, while union official Jake Molloy described it as “morally and ethically contemptible”.
