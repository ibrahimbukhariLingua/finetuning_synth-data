Melco International's Mocha Clubs, opened in 2003, helped introduce "cafe-style slot-machine parlors" to Macau, which were uncommon at the time. Melco completed the acquisition of Mocha Slot Group Limited in 2004.

The first iteration of Melco Resorts was formed in 2004 as a joint venture between Melco and Publishing & Broadcasting Limited (PBL). In September 2006, the PBL-Melco venture spent US$900 million purchasing the last of Macau's six gaming licenses from Wynn Resorts, allowing for the operation of "an unlimited number of casinos, tables and machines in Macau until June 2022." In May 2007, the venture launched the casino resort Altira Macau (Crown Macau) in Taipa for $1.45 billion. Melco Crown then launched City of Dreams Macau in 2009 for $2.4 billion, with Melco PBL owning 66% of the development and appointing Hyatt International to operate two hotels at the location. The following year, City of Dreams Macau's *House of Dancing Water* attraction became "the most popular" show in Macao.

In September 2017, Melco International subsequently obtained a majority stake in the City of Dreams Mediterranean Casino project, which is composed of up to four satellite casino premises in the country.

After Japanese lawmakers pushed for legalized gambling in integrated resorts, by 2017 Melco Resorts & Entertainment was bidding for one of an expected three licenses. In 2018 Melco Resorts opened Morpheus, a $1.1 billion hotel tower designed by Zaha Hadid, at City of Dreams Macau.
