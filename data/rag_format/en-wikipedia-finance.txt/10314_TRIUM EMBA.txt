## Overview

The TRIUM Global Executive MBA program spans 18 months and requires participants to commit 10 weeks to sessions beyond their regular work commitments. These learning sessions are conducted across various global hubs, including London, New York City, Paris, Seoul, Nairobi, and Dubai. Designed with a forward-thinking curriculum, the program aspires to arm students with the tools necessary to comprehend and adeptly traverse the challenges of a constantly evolving global business environment, while laying emphasis on contemporary business trends, geopolitics, and economic dynamics.

The TRIUM program has established a comprehensive admissions process to select its participants. This procedure is structured to verify that applicants not only satisfy academic and professional requirements but also resonate with the core values of the TRIUM community. The specified admissions criteria necessitate at least 10 years of professional work experience. There's an emphasis on candidates who have held senior management roles and have operated at an international level. Additionally, depending on specific backgrounds, potential entrants may need to provide English language proficiency scores such as TOEFL or IELTS, or standardized test scores like the GMAT or GRE.

The selection process is multifaceted. Initially, there is an evaluation based on the professional profile of a candidate. This is followed by an informational interview designed to determine alignment with the program's goals. Further in the process, applicants are required to complete a detailed application form that charts out their academic and professional trajectory. The final stage of the selection involves an interview with a high-ranking member of the Admissions Committee.


## Academics

Under the guidance of faculty from the partnering institutions, the TRIUM program offers exhaustive insights into global business, delving into areas like strategy, marketing, finance, decision-making, and leadership. A standout element of the program is the Capstone Project, presenting students with a platform to pragmatically implement their acquired knowledge. Specific modules, such as the one hosted in Seoul, concentrate on technological innovations and the consequential ramifications on the business sector.

Adopting an executive-accommodating blended learning approach, the program blends in-person classroom interactions with self-paced learning. Throughout the program's duration, students immerse themselves in over 500 live classroom hours and are expected to dedicate between 15 and 20 hours each week to independent study. This includes preparatory and follow-up module readings, assignments, case studies, collaborative projects, and the pivotal Capstone Project.

Structured to provide more than just an academic perspective, the TRIUM program promises a holistic global expedition. The inaugural three modules are stationed at the partner institutions, where foundational MBA subjects along with geopolitics are the focal points. Subsequent modules delve into advanced subjects, incorporating regional outlooks, and are situated in dynamic global cities. These modules are augmented by insights from local business moguls and subject matter experts. Additionally, considerable stress is laid on cultivating leadership prowess, priming students to spearhead diverse international teams.

Upon completing the coursework, students receive an MBA issued jointly by the three universities.
