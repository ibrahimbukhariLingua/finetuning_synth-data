**Laura McBain** is an Australian businesswoman and media commentator. She is the former CEO and managing director of Bellamy's Australia and is known for her leading role in transforming family-run Tasmanian business Bellamy's Organic into a major Australian and international organic food producer.


## Background and education

Born and raised in Sydney, McBain worked for a number of years as an accountant with Crowe Horwath (formerly WHK) and regional accounting firms in Launceston, while completing bachelor's degrees in Commerce and Business at the University of New South Wales and the University of Tasmania; and in 2013 completed the IMD Leadership Challenge.


## Bellamy's Organic

Prior to joining Bellamy's Organic Laura McBain practised as an accountant, specialising in the provision of business advisory and taxation services. She joined the then-struggling Launceston-based food and baby formula company in 2007 as general manager just prior to the buyout of the family owned business by Tasmanian Pure Foods.

McBain is widely credited as recognising the potential for Bellamy's in the nascent Chinese organic infant food and formula market, making the decision that turned the company into a major Chinese food brand. With McBain as general manager, the company reported a growth rate of 70% per annum over the period 2008 to 2013, with revenue growing by 900% over those five years to reach an estimated $50 million in the 2014 financial year. Latest company reporting has the business forecasting increased sales to China of 264% in FY2015.

In June 2014, Tasmanian Pure Foods was renamed Bellamy's Australia with McBain subsequently appointed as managing director and chief executive officer. Following a highly successful July 2014 IPO, Bellamy’s Australia Limited (BAL) listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) in August 2014.

On 26 August 2016, McBain sold 165,000 shares in Bellamy valued at $14.54 (total value $2.4 million) on top of the 400,000 shares sold at $10.49 (total value $4.19 million) on 17 March 2016.

In December 2016, Bellamy's Australia suspended trading of shares following a tumultuous fortnight for the organic group, which had half a billion dollars wiped off its value on 2 December. The share price dropped from a height of $13.58 to $5.98 after the company have revealed its report outlining that the company have had shrinking market share in China for the past few months.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In September 2023, she was announced as a member of the inaugural board of the Tasmania Football Club.
