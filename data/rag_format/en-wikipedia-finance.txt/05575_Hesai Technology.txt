# Hesai Technology



**Hesai Technology** (Hesai; Chinese: 禾赛科技; pinyin: *Hésài Kējì*) is a publicly listed Chinese technology company that engages in the development and sales of lidar products such as sensors. Its products are used mainly in the ADAS, vehicular automation, robotics and industrial sectors.


## History

When Hesai was founded, lidar products were entering a period of growth. Hesai released their lidar at half the price of their competitionᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ, earning them an immediate marketshare.

Hesai has seen domestic success in China. Previously Baidu acquired light sensors from Velodyne Lidar for its robotaxis. However Velodyne did not have a warehouse in China and it took months to send parts back and forth to the US for repair. Hesai took advantage by being able to provide domestic after-sales service that could repair components within two days. As a result, in 2018, Baidu awarded Hesai a contract to be its supplier.

In 2021 it launched its first generation lidar for self driving cars, and in 2022 it launched its second generation one. Li Auto became a customer of Hesai in 2021 and is its largest one. Other customers include Lotus Cars, Changan Automobile, SAIC Motor, and FAW Group, Nio and XPeng.

On February 9, 2023, Hesai held its initial public offering to become a listed company on the Nasdaq. It raised US$190 million making it the biggest Chinese listing since 2021 when DiDi listed. Hesai rose 11% on its trading debut. A US listing was chosen due to Hesai wanting more exposure on the global stage.

In May 2023, the Congressional Research Service produced a report accusing Hesai of supporting the Chinese military. In January 2024, the United States Department of Defense (DOD) added Hesai to the list of "Chinese military companies" operating in the U.S. In May 2024, Hesai sued the DOD asking it to remove Hesai from the list. It alleged the DOD's behavior was "arbitrary and capricious" because it did not provide the company with prior notice or an opportunity to respond. Hesai alleged the DOD failed to explain its rationale, provide evidence or review information submitted by Hesai. In August 2024, the DOD decided to remove Hesai from the list as it did not meet the legal criteria for inclusion. In October 2024, the DOD relisted Hesai based on new information. As a result, Hesai continued its lawsuit against the DOD.

In 2023, Hesai held 73% of the market share for robotaxi lidar suppliers. Its customers include Cruise, Aurora Innovation, Apolong, DiDi and Pony.ai.

In April 2024, Hesai stated it was considering building plants in Europe to make lidar products domestically for the European market.

Hesai Technology has been compared to RoboSense and is considered its main rival in China.
