Unlisted Trading Privileges


# Unlisted Trading Privileges



**Unlisted Trading Privileges** (**UTP**) oversees the Securities Information Processor for securities listed on Nasdaq and other securities that do not meet the requirements for listing on an exchange.


## Acquisition and distribution of market data

Nasdaq established the UTP Plan to outline the consolidation and distribution of data through one centralized resource called the Securities Information Processor (SIP).

The securities listed on Nasdaq can be quoted and traded from any US exchange. Trades and quotes on these securities are distributed on two separate feeds, the UTP Quotation Data Feed (UQDF) and the UTP Trade Data Feed (UTDF).

UQDF provides traders a direct view of an NBBO. These feeds are considered level 1 or the top-of-book.


## National Market System (NMS) plan

The NMS Plan regulates the UTP and Consolidated Tape Association (CTA) networks. The particulars for executing the regulation requires real-time reporting of transactions and their volumes, prices, and auditing details.


## UTP and CTA

Not all quote or transaction data are available from a single provider. The quotes and trades of Cboe and NYSE listed securities are consolidated in line with the Consolidated Tape Association (CTA). The Consolidated Tape Association distributes trades and quotes across the Consolidated Tape System (CTS) and the Consolidated Quote System (CQS) feeds. The CTA and CQS are listed across two tapes â€“ A and B. UTP is tape C.
