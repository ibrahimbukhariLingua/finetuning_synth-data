# Pacific Blue (company)



**Pacific Blue** (formerly **Pacific Hydro**) is an electricity generation and retailing company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. The company was founded in 1992 and was soon floated on the Australian Securities Exchange. It was later bought by a consortium of industry superannuation funds and de-listed. It is now owned by China's State Power Investment Corporation.

The company builds and operates renewable energy projects. It initially was initially involved in hydro electricity on irrigation dams, before opening its first wind farm in 2010. Pacific Blue is now involved in hydro, wind, solar and geothermal power projects.

Pacific Blue is also active in the production and trading of carbon credits from its run-of-river hydro projects registered under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.

The company is one of the pioneers of renewable energy development in Australia. Pacific Blue developed the first commercial wind farm in Victoria and, by 2023, operated a high-quality, diversified portfolio of wind, solar and hydro renewable assets in Australia, with a total generation capacity of over 660 MW and a significant pipeline of over 2 GW across the National Electricity Market (NEM).ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ

In April 2023, Tango Energy Pty Ltd was renamed Pacific Blue Retail Pty Ltd, and provided energy products to customers under the Pacific Blue Retail and Tango Energy brands. Its certified carbon neutral products are available through its Pacific Blue Retail brand.
