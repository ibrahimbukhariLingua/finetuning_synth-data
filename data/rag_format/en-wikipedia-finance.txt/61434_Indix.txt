# Indix



**Indix** was a company based in Seattle, Washington, in the United States that was offering a cloud-based product information platform. It also built a broad and deep product catalog to enable mobile and desktop apps and websites to become product-aware. Indix provided access to APIs that enable developers to build product-aware applications. The big data startup was headquartered in Seattle with a product development office in Chennai and was founded in 2010 by former Microsoft executive Sanjay Parthasarathy.


## Background

Indix's CEO and founder is Sanjay Parthasarathy. Parthasarathy left Microsoft in 2009, where he worked for 19 years in an executive capacity, notably starting and running the company's Developer & Platform Evangelism Division from 2000 to 2007. On retiring from Microsoft, he moved his family to India where he intended to launch a software company that would tackle key business problems facing companies in the changing world of commerce. The company raised a successful angel investment round in the spring of 2012 and Parthasarathy subsequently established its headquarters in Seattle.

Other co-founders of Indix include Sridhar Venkatesh, Rajesh Muppalla, Satya Kaliki and Jonah Stephen Jermiah.

Indix was acquired by Avalara, a provider of tax compliance automation software on February 6, 2019.


## Services

Indix's services are centered on proprietary algorithms that structure crawled product data and a data-as-a-service business model.

The database offers coverage for most consumer retail product categories. The database also includes many industrial and business-to-business products. Indix provides brands and retailers with access to data such as specifications, facets, availability, assortment, promotions, and real-time pricing information. Indix's infinite product catalog helps all client-facing digital media and environments become more product-aware.


### API

The Indix Product API utilizes a representational state transfer (RESTful) interface with 20+ endpoints including brand, store, category, product search, single product details, and product price history. The API is intended to function as a tool for product assortment, price, catalog enrichment, etc. optimization to medium and large sized brands and retailers. It is also meant to help developers build product-aware applications that connect consumers with the right product at the right time.

In 2013 Indix raised a series A round of funding from Nexus Venture Partners and Avalon Ventures. Last year the company raised $8.5 million in its series A-1 round. Additional angel funding has come from Venky Harinarayan, S. Somasegar, and Anand Rajaraman of @WalmartLabs.
