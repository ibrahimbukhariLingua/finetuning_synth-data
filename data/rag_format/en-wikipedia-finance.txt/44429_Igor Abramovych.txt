## Performance evaluation

According to the leader of the "Servant of the People" faction Davyd Arakhamia, Abramovych "with his pro-Ukrainian position was never associated with the ideology of the OPFL. It is enough to look at the "synchronicity" of his voting with former fellow party members. He is among strangers in the rear of the fifth column."

The representative of the local self-government, the mayor of Kharkiv Igor Terekhov gave a similar description: "Igor always, when the OPFL faction existed, was a "white crow" in it - a person who was distinguished from most of his colleagues by a clear pro-Ukrainian position. Precisely pro-Ukrainian, without any hints on the possibility to give in even the slightest to the national interests of the state".

According to the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Verkhovna Rada Danylo Hetmantsev, Abramovych always approached his work from purely pro-Ukrainian positions and regardless of political colors. Also, Hetmantsev notes, the vast majority of reforms that the committee has carried out since 2019 would not have taken place without Abramovych.

Davyd Arakhamia believes that the "Restoration of Ukraine" parliamentary group created by Abramovych in the most difficult months of the war only strengthened the stability of the parliament against the external aggressor.

"The humanitarian aid that he sent to his hometown can be counted in dozens of tons. Every day he called and asked what else needed help? And he found what was necessary, even if it was impossible to find it, and sent it to Kharkiv, to his compatriots. I know for sure that, having completed the mandate of the people's deputy, Igor Abramovych will remain the same person he was before: a patriot of Ukraine and a Kharkiv resident who will continue to do everything to support his native city," Terekhov summarized.
