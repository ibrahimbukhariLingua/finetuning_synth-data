Chinese government sanctions


# Chinese government sanctions



Sanctions of the government of the People's Republic of China are financial and trade restrictions imposed against individuals, entities, and jurisdictions whose actions it has determined to be contrary to certain national interests. China maintains three unilateral sanctions programs in addition to implementing the multilateral sanction decisions adopted by the United Nations Security Council.

China's three unilateral sanctions programs are separately administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, and the Taiwan Affairs Office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintains a sanctions list that imposes travel, trade, and financial restrictions against targeted individuals and entities accused of interfering with China's domestic affairs or endangering China's interests. The Ministry of Commerce maintains the "Unreliable Entity List", which heavily restricts allowable business and investment activity in China by listed entities. The Taiwan Affairs Office implements sanctions against Taiwan and targets entities and individuals accused of promoting Taiwanese independence.

In September 2020, the Ministry of Commerce issued new rules allowing for the creation of the "Unreliable Entity List", and the National People's Congress followed up soon after in June 2021 by promulgating the "Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law", which established a legal framework for maintaining previous sanctions. The law also allowed Chinese ministries, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan Affairs Office, to implement new blocking sanctions against foreign individuals and entities. The Taiwan Affairs Office announced a sanction under the new law in November 2021, and the Ministry of Commerce announced its first Unreliable Entity List designation in February 2023.

As of August 2024, over 100 individuals and entities have been sanctioned by China.
