**Optiva Inc.** (formerly **Redknee Solutions, Inc.**) is a Canadian telecommunications company that provides business support systems through cloud computing.


## History

Optiva was founded in 1999 as Redknee Solutions by then CEO, Lucas Skoczkowski, and four other co-founders. The company expanded into Europe in 2000 and opened R&D facilities in Pune, India in 2004. It was later listed on the London AIM Index in 2007 and on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2008.

In 2017 ESW Capital took control of the company, removing the CEO, Lucas Skoczkowski, and replacing him with Danielle Royston from ESW Capital.
Redknee Solutions was then rebranded as Optiva on Jan 16, 2018. The rebranding effort was completed on April 5, 2018.

In July 2020, Optiva made the decision to redeem its preferred shares. As a result, ESW lost control of the company, and Danielle Royston resigned as CEO. In August, at the annual and special meeting, the shareholders approved to ratify the adoption of the company's shareholder rights plan and to approve the unallocated options available under the company's stock option plan.

In December 2020, John Giere was named President and CEO of Optiva. Robert Stabile, Chairman of the Optiva Board since 2017, is the CEO as of May 2024.
