AFI Global Policy Forum


# AFI Global Policy Forum



The **Global Policy Forum** (GPF) is organized by the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, or AFI, as the keystone event for its membership and financial inclusion policymakers worldwide. Each year, it is co-hosted by a different member institution in a different region of the world. As of November 2023, AFI had 86 member institutions from over 80 countries, making the AFI GPF the most important and comprehensive forum for regulatory institutions with an interest in promoting financial inclusion policy. The AFI GPF is focused on developing and improving national financial inclusion strategies and policies and is used as a platform for senior financial regulators to exchange ideas as well as engage in peer-to-peer learning activities.


## Background

The AFI GPF has been recognized by leading international network of financial inclusion organizations and individuals as an important part of the global dialogue on financial inclusion. Participation at the AFI GPF has become part of the standard dialogue among leaders of regulatory institutions and is often harnessed to help resolve problems for the unbanked. 
In his opening remarks at the 10th AFI GPF in Sochi, Russia, Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir said: "We have over the last decade been able to raise the voice of emerging economies on challenges of financial inclusion through AFI GPFs and other regional platforms. We have, throughout the journey, made commitments and endorsed accords that have been instrumental in addressing countries financial inclusion challenges, ranging from measurement of financial inclusion, financing SMEs, bridging the gender-gap, taming the tide of de-risking, addressing financial inclusion and climate change aspects."

Participation at the AFI GPF is by invitation only. Participants include senior representatives from members, partners, central banks and other financial regulatory institutions from emerging, developing and developed economies.


## Global Policy Forum History


### 2009 AFI GPF in Nairobi, Kenya

The first AFI GPF was held in Kenya in 2009 and focused primarily on the promotion of the benefits of a knowledge exchange platform of peers. In his opening remarks, the governor of co-host Central Bank of Kenya, Prof. Njuguna Ndung'u, summarized the goal of the AFI GPF when he stated, "we will, over the next ten days, share experiences on smart financial inclusion policies that have worked elsewhere. We will thereafter adopt these policies to suit our respective countries as we work together to push forward the global financial access frontiers."

Highlighting the significance of the gathering, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Deputy Governor Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr. called the forum a “momentous occasion as policymakers, regulators, strategic partners and other stakeholders from all over the developing world have come together with the shared goal of building an inclusive financial system”.

### 2010 AFI GPF in Bali, Indonesia

The 2010 AFI GPF was held in Bali, Indonesia, by co-host Bank Indonesia and saw the financial inclusion concept recognized as a more formalized and an integral part of financial regulators' work.
In his keynote address, President of the Republic of Indonesia, Dr. H. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged the participants to "make this forum a bridge between our national, regional and global efforts. Let us collaborate and synergize our works to eradicate poverty through financial inclusion. I am convinced that we have just as much to share as we do to learn. We are looking forward to hearing your experiences from Asia, Africa and Latin America so we can be inspired by your ideas and make our own financial system stronger, more inclusive and innovative".

Beth Rhyne, the managing director at the Center for Financial Inclusion noted after the forum that "by bringing together this many policymakers interested in financial inclusion [to the AFI GPF], AFI creates a stronger voice for financial inclusion all around the world. Until now financial regulators have tended to place top priority on financial stability and have often perceived inclusion as a threat to stability. AFI’s work helps to get financial inclusion high on the agenda in a way that it has not been before".


### 2011 AFI GPF in Riviera Maya, Mexico

The 2011 AFI GPF was held in Riviera Maya, Mexico, and saw the entire membership adopt the Maya Declaration, marking the first time that regulators have committed to a common set of principles and goals for financial inclusion policy.

Over 300 participants from 80 financial regulatory institutions took part in 2011 AFI GPF, along with representatives from the World Bank, the United Nations, the Gates Foundation and other international organizations.

In his closing remarks, Mexico's President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa stated that "it is so important that we are all gathered here today, public officials, central bank presidents, ministers, secretaries, academics, specialists of over 70 countries, to reflect on the developments and challenges of financial inclusion. It is a key task, since, by opening the doors of credit, savings and insurance to more persons, we are giving more certainty to the present and we are broadening their capacity to build a better future. Financial inclusion is a means to reach greater social justice."

At the same ceremony, the United Nations Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance, Princess Maxima of the Netherlands, said that she was inspired to see that AFI GPF participants were at the forefront of innovations in policy, regulation and supervision, and now had an opportunity to lead developed country banking sectors in this field.
