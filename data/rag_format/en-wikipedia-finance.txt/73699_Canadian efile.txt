# Canadian efile



**EFILE** is the system used by the Canada Revenue Agency as a means for electronically transmitting tax returns. It became a national program in 1993. EFILE is only available to professional tax preparers and is not to be confused with the publicly available NETFILE. EFILE is a form of Electronic Data Interchange.

* Software meeting CRA certification standards, such as Intuit's Profile or Microsophic Inc.'s Visual Tax.
* Must be a professional to qualify, along with passing the CRA screening of new applicants.
