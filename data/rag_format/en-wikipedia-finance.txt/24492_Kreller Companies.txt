## History

From 1982 to 1988, Joe Davidoski worked in sales for Dun & Bradstreet, a publicly traded company that, at the time, had a 90% market share of the credit-check market. Davidoski was recognized as one of the company's top salesmen. After raising concerns internally for several years, in June 1988, a day after the enactment of Ohio's Whistleblower Statute, Davidoski sent a letter to management detailing the misleading and unethical nature of the company's selling practices. The story of his employer's alleged misconduct made front-page news, and Davidoski was featured on American news programs, including 20/20. Davidoski's complaints led to several lawsuits and inquiries, including one by the United States Postal Service. In June 1989, Dun & Bradstreet agreed to settle a number of these for $18 million.

In 1989, Davidoski left and formed Kreller, Inc., today known as Kreller Companies. One of the company's initial services was to work with customers to reduce their spend on third-party data providers, including Dun & Bradstreet.

In 1991, Kreller Companies began offering international credit reports. In the mid-1990s, Kreller Companies began offering international due diligence services. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the company's profile rose and its business doubled as Fortune 500 companies sought to sever any possible links to Al Qaeda.

In January 2020, Kreller Companies announced its acquisition of Smith Brandon International (SBI), a boutique corporate investigations and risk consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.
