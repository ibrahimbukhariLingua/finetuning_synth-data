# Harworth Group



**Harworth Group plc** ("Harworth") is a property developer that specialises in regenerating brownfield sites in Yorkshire, the Midlands, and North West England. The company is headquartered in Rotherham in South Yorkshire. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a member of the FTSE 250 Index.


## History

Harworth Estates was established in 2004 as the property division of UK Coal, named after the location of its headquarters in the village of Harworth in Nottinghamshire.

Following a restructuring in December 2012, UK Coal became Coalfield Resources plc. The new company owned 24.9% of Harworth Estates, with the remaining 75.1% owned by UK Coal's pension trustees, and later transferred to the Pension Protection Fund.

In March 2015, Coalfield Resources bought the remaining 75.1% of Harworth Estates from the Pension Protection Fund for £150 million. The acquisition was financed through a mixture of issuing new shares to the Pension Protection Fund and raising money though a public offering. It was renamed Harworth Group plc and was listed on the London Stock Exchange.

In March 2018, Alastair Lyons joined the business as Chairman. In November 2020, Lynda Shillaw was appointed Chief Executive.

As of 2023, the Pension Protection Fund retained a 23% holding in the business. The Peel Group owned a further 14% through its subsidiary, Goodweather Investment Management.


## Operations

Harworth owns approximately 14,000 acres (5,700 ha) of land across 100 sites, much of which is on the sites of old coal mines in the north of England and the Midlands. The business remediates land, takes it through the planning system, adds infrastructure and then either sells land to housebuilders or constructs industrial units.

In 2018 Harworth established a regional operating model, creating three regional teams: Yorkshire & Central, Midlands and North West.
