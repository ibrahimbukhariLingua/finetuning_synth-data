MLC Limited


# MLC Limited



**MLC** was an Australian business that provides investments, insurance and superannuation solutions to corporate, institutional, and retail customers. Due to divestments in the early 21st century, there are now two businesses, with no ownership links, that both use "MLC" in their branding:

* **MLC Limited trading as MLC Life Insurance**, the original insurance company registered in 1886 as "Citizens' Assurance company Limited", is an insurance company which is part of the Nippon Life Insurance Group.
* **MLC Wealth**, which consists of the investment and superannuation businesses that MLC Limited expanded into in the 20th century, is part of the Insignia Financial Group, which consists of Insignia Financial Ltd and its related bodies corporate.

## History

The company traces its origins to the **Citizens’ Assurance Company Limited**, registered on 31 December 1886 for the stated purpose “to popularise Industrial Life Assurance, and to carry it to the homes of the working classes by issuing policies for small amounts and receiving the premiums thereon each week”. It later became known as **Mutual Life & Citizens Assurance Company Limited**.

In 1982, Lend Lease acquired 50% of MLC Life Limited and in 1985 acquired the balance of the company. MLC's multi-manager, multi-style investment philosophy was introduced in 1986. In June 2000, MLC was sold to the National Australia Bank. for $4.56 billion, one of the biggest mergers in Australian corporate history.

In October 2016, the insurance division of MLC limited was divested by National Australia Bank, with Nippon Life Japan acquiring a majority stake (80%). This created a new and separate business, MLC Life Insurance, which provides insurance products and services.

On 31 May 2021, the National Australia Bank sold its remaining "MLC" branded wealth management businesses to Insignia Financial (then known as IOOF).

MLC Limited (known as MLC Life Insurance) uses the MLC brand under licence from MLC Wealth Holdings Limited. MLC Wealth Holdings Limited is part of the Insignia Financial Group. MLC Limited is part of the Nippon Life Insurance Group and is not part of the Insignia Financial Group of companies.
