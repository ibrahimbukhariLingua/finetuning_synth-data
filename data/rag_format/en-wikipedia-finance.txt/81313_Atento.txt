## History

In 2000, Atento was launched in Spain, when Telefónica grouped its call center business in Spain and other Latin American countries into a subsidiary business unit.

In October 2012, Telefónica agreed to sell Atento to Bain Capital for $1.3bn. Under the terms of the deal, Atento would continue to provide services to the Telefónica Group for at least nine years after the agreement.

In September 2014, Atento announces launch of Initial Public Offering (IPO). In October, the company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions for a $300 million IPO. Atento hired the investment-banking units of Morgan Stanley & Co (MS.N), Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX and Brazil's Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) to handle the transaction.


### Divestments

In 2014 Atento announced the sale of its operations in the Czech Republic to Comdata SPA to continue strengthening its focus on its core markets.

In 2015 Atento announced the sale of its operations in Morocco to Intelcia Group. Atento's operations in Morocco, which provide services to the Spanish market were excluded from the transaction and continue operating as part of Atento Spain.

Atento Digital was launched in 2017 as a unit to integrate all of the company's digital assets and was a move aimed at client value add and overall growth. Before the launch of the unit, digital services accounted for only 6% of the company's revenues. The 2018 acquisition of a minority stake in Keepcon enhanced this unit by expanding the artificial intelligence and automation capabilities of the unit through a strategic partnership.


### Acquisitions and Partnerships

In 2016 Atento acquired a majority stake in R Brasil Solucoes to expand collections and digital collections capabilities.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

At the time of the action, Interlife had more than 1,700 staff and 30 offices in Brazil. A second Brazil-focused alliance formed between Atento and Falconi, a Latin American consulting firm, the same year; this fulfilled a standing desire of Falconi to work with a high technology partner.

In 2018, Atento also reached a partnership with T-Systems, on the provision of data center services in Brazil, and with Unimed Rio in Brazil to modernize its customer relationship structure.
