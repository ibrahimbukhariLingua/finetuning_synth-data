**Envex** is a company which develops financial instruments for electricity trading and emissions trading under the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and other environmental markets in Australia.


## History

The company was founded in February 2008 as a joint venture between Macquarie Group Limited and the Financial and Energy Exchange. In July of the same year Climate Exchange PLC, owner of the European Climate Exchange and the Chicago Climate Exchange, acquired a stake in Envex. Following the purchase of the European Climate Exchange by ICE, ICE also became the holder of Envex.

The core focus of Envex's work is to develop tradable contracts for Over-the-Counter and exchange-based trading to "enable trading in a range of environmental products" in the Australian markets. These include financial instruments related to the underlying units of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme, the Carbon Price Mechanism ( also known as the Clean Energy Bill 2011), the Queensland Gas Scheme, Victorian Energy Efficiency Target and South Australian Energy Savings Scheme.
