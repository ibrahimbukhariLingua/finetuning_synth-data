It combined **International Shipping Partners** (ISP), a passenger ship management services company headquartered in Miami, Florida, United States, and **River Advice** of Basel, Switzerland. The majority owners became a Netherlands-based private equity fund. In January 2014 the two operations were renamed FleetPro Ocean and FleetPro River respectively.
