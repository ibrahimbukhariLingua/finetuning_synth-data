## Awards and honours

## Research

Moore has conducted field research in Asia and Africa, particularly Sri Lanka, India, and Taiwan, and has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was previously the director of the Centre for the Future State, and is a member of the OECD Task Force on Tax and Development. His main research interests are the domestic and international dimensions of good and bad governance in developing countries, particularly those relating to taxation. He focuses on the process by which widening the tax base in low-income countries can help foster a social contract between citizens and the government through associated demands for public services. In contrast to receiving revenue from foreign aid or natural resources, governments who rely on taxes have to bargain with their citizens, and have incentives to promote their prosperity, thereby enhancing good governance. As an expert on these issues, he has been called several times to speak as a witness for the UK Parliament International Development Committee.

His book *Taxing Africa: Coercion, Reform and Development* was published by Zed Books in July 2018. Co-authored with Wilson Prichard and Odd-Helge Fjeldstad*,* the book offers a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the crucial debates around taxation and development in Africa. It examines issues from tax evasion by multinational corporations and African elites to how ordinary people navigate complex webs of ‘informal’ local taxation, examining the challenges and the potential for reform.
