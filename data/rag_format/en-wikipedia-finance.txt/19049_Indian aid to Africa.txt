India's development co-operation with Africa began in 1949, just two years after its independence, when it provided 70 educational scholarships for students to study in India. Co-operation grew further after the 1955 Bandung Conference, a meeting of Asian and African states most of which were newly independent. India was the first Asian country to become a member of the Africa Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF).
