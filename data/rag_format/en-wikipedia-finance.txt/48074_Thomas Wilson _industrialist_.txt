He was hired on as an apprentice boilermaker and rose quickly along the corporate ladder.

By the end of the American Civil War, Wilson owned a chain of foundries. He and his family moved to Sumter, South Carolina, and established a number of companies throughout the South.

Wilson developed the Northwestern Railroad of South Carolina and later served as head of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the St. Charles Hotel and the First National Bank of Sumter, among others.

By 1864 he had fathered several children, one of whom had died. He owned large swathes of land throughout the South; with especially large ones in Florida. His land holdings included all of what is now Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. By the end of his life, he was the wealthiest person in South Carolina.
