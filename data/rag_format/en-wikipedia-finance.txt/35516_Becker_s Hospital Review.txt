Becker's Hospital Review


# Becker's Hospital Review



**Becker's Hospital Review** is a medical industry trade magazine that does its own research, supplementing this with government-released data and U.S. News & World Report rankings. It is published by ASC Communications, Inc., an Illinois corporation owned or controlled by its registered agent, Scott Becker, and lists with the Illinois Secretary of State its offices as being located at 77 W. Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois. It covers its field from the prospective of those involved: doctors, hospitals, and those who pay: patients and the general public (via taxes and insurance premiums). Some of these topics come together, such as a hospital's payout for disclosing a patient's HIV information to the person's employer, and reviewing how their privacy policy can accommodate the needs of hospital staff, those being treated, and the employer's insurance personnel.

Government web sites refer to their information, and they summarize legislative hearings, albeit much of this is press releases by various agencies.
