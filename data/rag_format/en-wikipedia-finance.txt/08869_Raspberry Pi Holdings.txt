## History

In 2012, a charity established to promote the study of computer science, the Raspberry Pi Foundation, set up a new commercial entity responsible for developing and manufacturing its computers, namely Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd. It installed Eben Upton as CEO.

One of the company's objectives was to make the product affordable to schools and school children and, in 2015, it launched the Raspberry Pi Zero at a selling price of US$5 or Â£4.

In 2021, Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd changed its name to Raspberry Pi Ltd. Its newly-formed holding company, Raspberry Pi Holdings, was the subject of an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in June 2024. As a result of the initial public offering, Raspberry Pi Holdings' largest shareholder, the Raspberry Pi Foundation, was diluted from holding 77.31% of the company to just 49.08% of it.


## Operations

The company uses Broadcom as supplier of system on a chip components and Sony as manufacturer of most of its products. As of June 2024, the company had sold 60 million single-board computers.
