## Congressional letter and investigation

Ryan Homes, a business under the NVR umbrella, received a letter from Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) which asked the company to stop the practice of forced arbitration. Three senators joined in and asked that both Ryan Homes and NVR "remove the arbitration provisions from their agreements and stop requiring homebuyers to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to resolve disputes." USA Today conducted an investigation that found that Ryan Homes "ignored warranty requests for dozens if not hundreds of customers nationally."


## Class-action lawsuit

A lawsuit filed by homeowners in Bella Collina, a community run by DCS Capital Investments, accused Randall Greene of "racketeering, embezzling, and conspiracy." The lawsuit stated that the homeowners association (HOA) should have been turned over to the homeowners instead of DCS Capital Investments; the suit was dismissed by a federal court a year later.
