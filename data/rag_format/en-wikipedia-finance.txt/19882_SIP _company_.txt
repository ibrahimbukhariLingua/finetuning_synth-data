## History

In 1964, the energy assets of Società Idroelettrica Piemontese (SIP), founded in 1918, was nationalized into Enel; it then acquired all of the Italian telephone companies, becoming Società Italiana per l'Esercizio Telefonico (SIP). It was run by the Italian Ministry of Finance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ. SIP was a state monopoly from 1964 to 1996 and Italians were required to pay the "Canone Telecom," a line rental fee of approximately €120 per year., plus hardware rental and other minor costs) in order to have a phone at home.

On 27 July 1994, by the merger of several telecommunications companies among which SIP, IRITEL, Italcable, Telespazio and SIRM (companies owned by STET), Telecom Italia was born. This was due to a reorganization plan for the telecommunications sector presented by IRI to the Minister of Finance.
