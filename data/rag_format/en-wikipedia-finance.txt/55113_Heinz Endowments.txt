# Heinz Endowments



**The Heinz Endowments** is a philanthropic organization in the United States, and was formed with the combined support from two smaller, private foundations: the **Howard Heinz Endowment** and the **Vira I. Heinz Endowment**. It awards more than $60 million annually in grants to a range of nonprofit organizations.


## Mission

The Heinz Endowments "seeks to help [its] region thrive as a whole and just community, and through that work to model solutions to major national and global challenges," and concentrates "on advancing a sustainable future for our community and planet, successful learning outcomes for young people and their families, and a culture of engaged creativity for all our citizens."


## History

Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the Heinz Endowments consists of two private foundations: the Howard Heinz Endowment and the Vira I. Heinz Endowment. The Howard Heinz Endowment was established in 1941 via a bequeath from the residual estate of Howard Heinz (1877-1941), a native of Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania who had served as president of the H. J. Heinz Co. The Vira I. Heinz Endowment was formed via funding from the estate of Vira I. Heinz, the first woman to serve on the board of directors of a multinational corporation headquartered in Pittsburgh (the H. J. Heinz Co.), the first woman to serve on the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University, and the founder of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.


## Leadership

In 2014, former Pittsburgh Foundation president and CEO Grant Oliphant became president of the Endowments. He had been associated with the Heinz family since joining the staff of U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III in 1988 and had served the Heinz Endowments in management roles before helming the Pittsburgh Foundation.
