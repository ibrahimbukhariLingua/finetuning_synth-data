# Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803



The **Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803** (43 Geo. 3. c. 139) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Prior to its repeal in 2013, it created offences of forgery of foreign instruments in Scotland.


## Preamble

The preamble read:

> Whereas the practice of forging and counterfeiting foreign bills of exchange, foreign promissory notes, and foreign orders for payment of money hath of late greatly increased, and plates of such bills, notes, and orders have been in some instances engraven within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, whereby such forgeries have been more easily committed; and it is expedient that effectual provision should be made for the preventing of the same:


## Section 1

In Scotland, this section read:

> If any person from and after the passing of this Act shall, within any part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, falsely make, forge, or counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsely made, forged, or counterfeited, or knowingly aid or assist in the false making, forging, or counterfeiting any bill of exchange, or any promissory note, undertaking, or order for the payment of money, purporting to be the bill of exchange, promissory note, undertaking, or order for the payment of money of any foreign prince, state, or country whatsoever, or of any minister or officer entrusted by or employed in the service of any foreign prince, state, or country, or of any person or company of persons resident in any foreign state or country, or of any body corporate and politic, and body in the nature of a body corporate and politic, created or constituted by any foreign prince or state, with intent to deceive or defraud his Majesty, his heirs and successors, or any such foreign prince, state, or country, or with intent to deceive or defraud any person or company of persons whomsoever, or any body corporate and politic, or body in the nature of a body corporate and politic whatsoever, whether the same be respectively resident, carrying on business, constituted or being in any part of the United Kingdom or in any foreign state or country, and whether such bill of exchange, promissory note, or order be in the English language, or in any foreign language or languages, or partly in one and partly in the other; or if any person from and after the passing of this Act shall, within any part of the said United Kingdom, tender in payment or in exchange, or otherwise utter or publish as true any such false, forged, or counterfeited bill of exchange, promissory note, undertaking, or order, knowing the same to be false, forged, or counterfeited, with intent to deceive or defraud his Majesty, his heirs and successors, or any foreign prince, state, or country, or any person or company of persons, or any body corporate and politic, or body in the nature of a body politic and corporate as aforesaid; then every person so offending shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of felony, and being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be transported for any term of years not exceeding fourteen years.
