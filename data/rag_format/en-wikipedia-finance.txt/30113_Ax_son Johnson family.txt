# Ax:son Johnson family



The **Ax:son Johnson family** (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈâksɛlˌsɔn ˈjǔːnsɔn]) is a prominent Swedish business family, controlling the Axel Johnson Group and Nordstjernan.


## History

In 1873, Axel Johnson founded the trading company A. Johnson & Co., the predecessor of today's Axel Johnson AB.

He managed to break the international coffee monopoly, known as the "coffee conference", a strictly controlled pricing cartel for the transportation of coffee to Europe.
