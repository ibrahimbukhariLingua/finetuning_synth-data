## History

The business was founded in 1938 and became part of the Dutch company Philips in 1963. In 1990, through a management buyout, it became part of Roxboro Group, which was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1993. In 2005, it was renamed Dialight.

In 2012, Dialight announced that they would expand their manufacturing capabilities in Malaysia.

In 2023, it was revealed that Dialight had been involved in prolonged legal proceedings with its former manufacturing partner, Sanmina Corporation, regarding the termination of their manufacturing services agreement. Dialight filed the lawsuit seeking compensation for what it alleged were Sanminaâ€™s fraudulent actions, gross negligence, and breaches of their contract.

In 2024, Dialight's claims of fraudulent inducement against its former contractor were allowed to proceed to trial after a New York court denied Sanmina's attempts to dismiss these allegations.
