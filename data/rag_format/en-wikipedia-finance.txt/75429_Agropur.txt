## History

In 1971, the Quebec-based Coopérative Agricole de Granby (renamed Agropur in 1979) obtained the Canadian licence to manufacture and market Yoplait products. In 1993, Agropur's yogurt manufacturing and marketing operations were combined with those of Agrifoods, a federal cooperative owned by 2,500 dairy producers in Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan, forming Ultima Foods.

In December 2020, Agropur announced the sale of its yogurt activities in Canada to Lactalis, a French based company.

In 2022, Agropur made a significant $34 million investment in its ice cream and frozen novelties plant novelties in Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada.
