**Policybazaar** is an Indian insurance aggregator and multinational financial technology company based in Gurgaon. The corporation was established in June 2008 by Yashish Dahiya, Alok Bansal and Avaneesh Nirjar. It provides a digital platform—website and an app—where users can compare insurance policies and other financial services from major insurance companies. The company is India's largest insurance aggregator, and has expanded its operations to the United Arab Emirates.

Policybazaar is the flagship subsidiary of **PB Fintech Ltd.**, which also owns the credit product aggregator Paisabazaar.


## History

Policybazaar.com was founded in June 2008 by Yashish Dahiya, Alok Bansal, and Avaneesh Nirjar, starting out as an insurance comparison website. At that time, the Indian insurance industry still lacked transparency and policies were mostly sold through agents. Policybazaar started by listing the details of multiple insurance policies for customers to choose from. It began as a price-comparison website, and an information portal for learning about insurance and insurance programs. The website subsequently expanded to become a marketplace for insurance policies. In 2015, Policybazaar launched its app for Android and iOS users.

In February 2020, Sarbvir Singh was appointed CEO, effective December 2019, while Yashish Dahiya took over the role of group CEO.

In June 2021, Policybazaar obtained an insurance broking license from IRDAI and announced that it would set up 100 offline outlets across India. The company also surrendered its web aggregator license.


## Products

In 2021, Policybazaar moved from a policy price comparison website to an insurance selling operation. The company claims to process nearly 25% of India's life insurance and over 7% of the country's retail health cover.

Policybazaar.com has tie-ups with insurance companies that help it procure information such as prices, benefits, insurance cover, etc. directly from the insurers. Users can use the Policybazaar website or app to research, compare and buy insurance policies from over 40 insurance providers. Policybazaar has companies that offer car insurance, health insurance, life insurance, corporate insurance, and travel insurance as its business partners.

The Insurance Regulatory And Development Authority of India regulates the insurance web aggregation business of Policybazaar. The company is registered as an insurance web aggregator under the Insurance Web Aggregator Regulations, 2017.
