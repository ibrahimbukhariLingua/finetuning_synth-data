## History

The credit union was founded in 1936 as the Albuquerque Public Schools Federal Credit Union. Its field of membership grew to include employees of Albuquerque Technical-Vocational Institute in 1968. Ten years later, employees of the University of New Mexico and University of New Mexico Hospital were added. To reflect its changed membership, the credit union changed its name to New Mexico Educators Federal Credit Union in 1982. Members of La Monta√±ita Food Co-op became eligible for membership in 1984. New Mexico Educators Federal Credit Union continued to grow its assets and membership over the years and built new branches. In February 2015, the credit union changed its name again, to Nusenda Credit Union after collecting member feedback about its name for more than a decade and conducting more than a year of in-depth research.
