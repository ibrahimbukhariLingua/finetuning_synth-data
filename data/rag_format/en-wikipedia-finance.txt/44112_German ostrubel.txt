German ostrubel


# German ostrubel



**Ostrubel** (German and Polish: *Ostrubel*; Latvian and Lithuanian: *Ostrublis*; Russian: Острубль) is the name given to a currency denominated in copecks and rubels, which was issued by Germany in 1916 for use in the eastern areas under German occupation (*Ober Ost* and the Government General of Warsaw). It was initially equal to the Imperial rouble. The reason for the issue was a shortage of currency. The banknotes were produced by the *Darlehnskasse* in *Posen* (now *Poznań*) on 17 April 1916.

From 4 April 1916, the *Ostrubel* circulated alongside the *Ostmark* in the *Ober Ost* area, with *2 Ostmarken* = 1 *Ostrubel*. In the Government General of Warsaw the *Ostruble* was replaced by the Polish marka on 14 April 1917.


## Denominations

The banknote denominations available were:

* 20 copecks;
* 50 copecks;
* 1 rubel;
* 3 rubels;
* 10 rubels;
* 25 rubels;
* 100 rubels.

The front sides of the banknotes carry a warning in German against forging banknotes. On the reverse sides is the same warning in Latvian (with old style orthography), Lithuanian and Polish.

There were also 1 copeck, 2 copeck and 3 copeck coins, made out of iron.


## Aftermath

The *Ostrubel* circulated in Lithuania together with the Ostmark until 1 October 1922, when it was replaced by the *litas*.

It was also still in use in a part of the Second Polish Republic during the first months of independence, until 29 April 1920.
