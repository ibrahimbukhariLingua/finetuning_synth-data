## History

The Institute of Economics commenced its activities in 1980. Its research at that time concentrated on problems related to socialist planned economies. During the 80s INE PAN was actively engaged in the promotion of independent thinking on economic issues. It significantly contributed to the success of Polish economic reforms after the collapse of the socialist system in 1989.

During the 1990s the Institute was reorganized and took active part in the analysis and evaluation of free market economic developments in Poland. At present there are about forty scholars and researchers working in four departments of the Institute: Microeconomics, Economic Policy, Institutional Economics and the World Economy. Many of them have occupied important posts in the Cabinet of Poland, Parliament (Sejm), the National Bank of Poland, the Polish Monetary Policy Council, the European Commission and the World Bank.

INE PAN’s main research areas are contemporary economic theory, economic policy, analysis, evaluation, and strategic studies of the Polish economy, and analysis of the world economy and European integration.
