## History

Yext was founded in 2006 as a local advertising business. Its 2009 revenue was $20 million after it switched to generating customer leads and charging per lead.

In August 2012, the company sold its pay-per-call business to IAC's CityGrid Media in order to focus on listings. By that time, Yext had raised $65.8 million in funding and handled 950,000 updates for 50,000 businesses.

Investors included Sutter Hill Ventures, Institutional Venture Partners, and WGI investments. By 2016, the company had $89 million in revenue and had expanded its offices at One Madison Avenue to 95,000 square feet.

In 2016, the company was ranked #60 on the Deloitte Fast 500 North America list.

In 2017, Yext was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2019, Yext announced that it was moving its headquarters to 61 Ninth Ave in New York City, dubbed "The Yext Building". The distinctive building was designed by famed architect Rafael Vi√±oly. The move was originally planned for March 2020 but was delayed due to the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

In March 2022, the company's founder Howard Lerman, announced that he was stepping down as CEO. He was succeeded as CEO by Michael Walrath who had been the Chairman of the Board since 2011.
