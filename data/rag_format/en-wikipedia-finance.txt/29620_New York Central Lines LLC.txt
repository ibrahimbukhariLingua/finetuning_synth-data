New York Central Lines LLC


# New York Central Lines LLC



**New York Central Lines LLC** was a limited liability company that owned railroad lines in the United States that are owned and operated by CSX Transportation. The company was formed in 1998 to own Conrail lines assigned to CSX in the split of Conrail between CSX and the Norfolk Southern Railway; operations were switched over on June 1, 1999. The company was named after the old New York Central Railroad, whose old main line became a line of the new company. In November 2003, the Surface Transportation Board approved a plan allowing CSX to fully absorb New York Central Lines, which was done on August 27, 2004.
