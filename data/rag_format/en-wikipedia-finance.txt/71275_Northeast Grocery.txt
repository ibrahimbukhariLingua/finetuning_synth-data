# Northeast Grocery



**Northeast Grocery** is the parent company of Tops Friendly Markets, Price Chopper and Market 32. The company was formed after a merger in 2021 which gives the company nearly 300 stores in the northeast United States.


## History

On February 8, 2021, Price Chopper and Tops announced plans to merge. The new parent company would be headquartered in Schenectady, New York. The Price Chopper and Tops businesses will retain main offices in Schenectady and Williamsville respectively and will continue to be managed locally by their respective leaders.

Nine months later, the merger was completed. The stores are now owned and overseen by Northeast Grocery. The President and CEO of Price Chopper, Scott Grimmett, stayed on to manage the merger before retiring in February 2022, with Tops Friendly Markets CEO Frank Curci taking over after that. The FTC required the combined company to divest from 12 of the combined companiesâ€™ stores. Those stores were sold to C&S Wholesale Grocers with most given the Grand Union name.
