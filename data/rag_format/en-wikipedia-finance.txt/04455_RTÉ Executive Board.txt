RTÉ Executive Board


# RTÉ Executive Board



The **RTÉ Executive Board**, despite its name, was not a board of directors, but rather was a committee composed of the senior management of the Irish public service broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann, responsible for the day-to-day running of the broadcaster.

The executive board reported to the RTÉ Board through the director general. It was disbanded by the newly appointed Director General Kevin Bakhurst on his first day following the RTÉ secret payment scandal, and replaced by a "temporary interim leadership team".


## Composition

The executive board was chaired by the Director General of RTÉ.

The remainder of the committee included managing directors of television, radio, news and current affairs, and heads of content, channels and marketing, corporate development, commercial, legal and other functions, the chief digital officer, the chief technology officer, the chief financial officer.

The director general is appointed by the RTÉ Board, with the consent of the government and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, while the other board members were appointed by the director general.

## Controversies


### Mission to Prey

Following RTÉ's defamation of Father Kevin Reynolds in its "Mission to Prey" episode of *Prime Time*, RTÉ announced that Ed Mulhall, MD News, had "retired" on 3 April 2012.


### Presenter pay and other matters

In June 2023, RTÉ admitted that it paid its top presenter Ryan Tubridy €345,000 more than publicly declared between 2017 and 2022. Dee Forbes was suspended as Director General a day prior to the controversy, and ultimately resigned with immediate effect on 26 June.
A statement from the interim Director General claimed that only Forbes had a complete picture, although someone prepared all the materials, advised her and enacted the actions to engage and pay Tubridy.
