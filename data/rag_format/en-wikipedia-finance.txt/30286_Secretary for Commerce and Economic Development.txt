# Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development



The **Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development** heads the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau of the Hong Kong Government. The Secretary is responsible for promoting commerce and the economic development of Hong Kong. The position was created in 2007 by merging the previous portfolios of the Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology and the Secretary for Economic Development and Labour.

It was renamed and re-organised as the *Secretary for Commerce and Industry* in 2000, and replaced by the **Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology** (Chinese: 工商及科技局局長) in 2002, with new responsibilities of technology sectors after merging with Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting.
