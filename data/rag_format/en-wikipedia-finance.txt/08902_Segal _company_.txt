## History

Segal was founded in 1939 by Martin E. Segal as the Martin E. Segal Company in New York, which provided consultants and actuaries for employee benefit plans.

In 1969, the company founded Segal Advisors as its investment consulting unit. In 1991, the company’s name was shortened to The Segal Co. When Segal acquired Rogerscasey in 2012, the name of the investment unit changed to Segal Rogerscasey.

In 2013, Segal’s Fiduciary Liability Insurance Practice was incorporated as the insurance brokerage subsidiary of Segal and renamed Segal Select Insurance Services, Inc.

In 2016, the firm announced the upcoming acquisition of the Marco Consulting Group. The acquisition became effective January 1, 2017, and Segal Rogerscasey became Segal Marco Advisors. The new group had combined advisory assets of more than $500 billion.

In 2019, Segal’s communication practice combined with recent acquisition Benz Communications to form Segal Benz.

In 2020, Segal acquired LRWL Inc., a provider of public sector retirement systems implementation services, integrating its team into Segal’s Administration, Technology, and Consulting Practice. This acquisition enhances Segal’s support for public sector entities, which was noted by David Blumenstein, Segal’s CEO.

In 2022, Segal acquired Michigan-based insurance broker Union Services Agency, which provides services to labor organizations, multiemployer funds and public sector entities. The same year, it acquired Milliman’s San Francisco investment consulting practice.
