## Controversies

In October 2016 AEW UK closed Ryde Arena, an ice skating rink on the Isle of Wight which was being run by a local community group, without notice. Children expecting to attend regular hockey and skating practice found themselves locked out of the building. The building remains closed and AEW have not disclosed their plans for the building. Members of the Isle of Wight skating community formed The Ryde Arena Community Action Group which is campaigning to have the building re-opened. The building was listed as an asset of community value in January 2016. Stories highlighting the impact of AEW’s actions on children on the Island feature on the Action Group’s website.

In June 2016 a planning application submitted by AEW UK for 76 flats in Bournemouth's Beales store was unanimously rejected after a campaign by locals and the owners of Beales backed by Conor Burns MP. The 65 studio and 11 one bedroom flats with no parking which were described by AEW UK as "an environmentally sustainable approach" which "made the best use of the building" were rejected by councillors as "shabby" and "appalling".
