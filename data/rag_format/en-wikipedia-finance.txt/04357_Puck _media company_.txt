# Puck (media company)



***Puck*** is an American digital media company founded in 2021. *Puck*'s coverage aims to cover the 'four centers of power' in the United States: Silicon Valley, Hollywood, Washington, D.C. and Wall Street.


## Etymology

The name of the company is a play on the name of the character in William Shakespeare's play *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, as well as a reference to the Puck Building in Manhattan.


## Editorial tone and style

In a 2022 profile, *The New Yorker* described *Puck*'s editorial tone as being "deliberately clubby," with part of the appeal for readers being that "its writers move in the same elevated spaces as the people whom they cover." Bloomberg News described *Puck* as a company that "treats reporters like social media influencers".
