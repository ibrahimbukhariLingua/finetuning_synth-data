## History

The subject of a London Chamber was first discussed in early 1906, when a number of meetings regarding the arrangement of a Swedish exhibition, led to the establishment of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in London. The Board of Trade granted the Certificate of Incorporation and offices were hired at 136 Fenchurch Street. At the end of 1907 at least 189 members had been elected.
