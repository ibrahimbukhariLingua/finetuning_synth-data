In July 2006, Xfone International shares were listed for trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At the time, Xfone comprised a number of companies, including Swiftnet Limited, a British company providing local and international telecommunications services and value added services, and Xfone USA, Inc., an American company providing local and international telecommunications services. In August 2007, it acquired NTS Communications from Dallas, Texas, which provides integrated solutions, voice, video and data, for $42 million.
