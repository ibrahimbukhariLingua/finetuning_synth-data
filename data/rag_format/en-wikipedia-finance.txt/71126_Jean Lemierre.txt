**Jean Lemierre** (born 6 June 1950) is a French former public servant who was the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 2000 to 2008. He is now chairman of BNP Paribas.


## Career


### Public sector

In 2000, Lemierre was elected as the new chief of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), succeeding Horst Köhler. During his time in office, he warned Russia to stop Yukos-style expropriations from spreading.

In 2004, the French government nominated Lemierre as candidate to head the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the post went to Rodrigo Rato instead. From 2005 until 2008, he served on the advisory board of the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor.


### Private sector

Following his departure from EBRD, Lemierre joined BNP Paribas as an adviser.

In 2011, Lemierre (alongside Charles Dallara) was co-head of the bondholders’ committee that renegotiated €200 billion of Greek bonds with the government in a high-stakes deal that staved off the country's collapse.

Lemierre was the bank's key negotiator in the record $8.9 billion fine it paid in 2014 for violating U.S. sanctions on Sudan, Libya and Cuba between 2002 and 2012. In 2014, he was appointed chairman of the board of directors.
