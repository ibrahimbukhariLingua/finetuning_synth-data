ES Power Singapore


# ES Power Singapore



**ES Power** is an electricity retailing service started by Environmental Solutions (Asia) Pte. Ltd. in 2016. ES Power was the first electricity service in Singapore to offer complete carbon offset to its customer for their electricity. Carbon offsets are given through carbon credits which, in turn, are used to invest in non-renewable energy related projects around the globe, especially in developing countries. ES Power has since be re-branded as ES Living and focuses more on the environmental attributes.
