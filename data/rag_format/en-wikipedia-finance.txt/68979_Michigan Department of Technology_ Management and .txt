The **Michigan Department of Technology, Management & Budget** (**DTMB**), formerly Michigan Department of Management and Budget, is a principal department of the government of Michigan responsible for various support functions within the government.


## History

The Michigan Department of Management and Budget (DMB) was formed in 1984 by law as a principal department of state government. Created within the department, under the same law, was the Office of the State Budget Director. In 1979, the Governor created an autonomous Office of the State Employer within the department.

Under Executive Order No. 2007 - 30, the Michigan Department of Civil Service was abolished with the Board of Ethics, State Officers Compensation Commission and Civil Service Commission transfer to the department on August 26, 2007. In 2009, then Governor Jennifer Granholm planned to merge the Department of Information Technology into this Department, naming current DIT Director as Director of the merged department and the current DIT Chief Deputy Director Phyllis Mellon as temporary director of the Department of Management and Budget. The previous director left to become senior vice president for finance and administration, Lansing Community College. The Executive Order renaming it was effective March 21, 2010.

On January 1, 2013, DTMB started the MiTV online portal and received the Michigan Government Television channel equipment when it was closed down in mid-January. MiTV would stream sessions of the state houses and other governmental meetings in place of the MGTV PEG channel.

DTMB currently supports the business operations of state agencies through a variety of services, including building management and maintenance, information technology, centralized contracting and procurement, budget and financial management, space planning and leasing, construction management, motor vehicle fleet operations, and oversight of the state retirement systems.
