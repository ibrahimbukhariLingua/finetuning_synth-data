## Quotes

"I don't consider myself an economist. I am first and foremost a journalist, an economical journalist. I came to economics through journalism".

In a front-page article of *Le Monde*, Izraelewicz portrayed the flaws of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in July 1996 as a reflection of the negative aspects of American society, writing: "A megalomaniacal America. An America enslaved by technology. An America ruled by money", and he quoted a member of the International Olympic Committee as saying: "It is our fault. We should not have handed over the Olympic Games to private enterprises because their sole aim is to make money".
