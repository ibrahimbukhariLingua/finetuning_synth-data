# Bolsa de Madrid



**Bolsa de Madrid** (Spanish pronunciation: [bolsa ðe ˈmaðɾið]; **Madrid Stock Exchange**) is the largest and most international of Spain's four regional stock exchanges (the others are located in Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao) that trade shares and convertible bonds and fixed income securities, and both government and private-sector debt. Bolsa de Madrid is owned by Bolsas y Mercados Españoles.


## Structure and operations

The reorganisation of Spain's financial market under the national umbrella of the Spanish Stock Market includes the *bolsas*, the derivatives markets, and fixed-income markets. Trading is linked through the electronic Spanish Stock Market Interconnection System (SIBE), which handles more than 90% of transactions; all fixed-income assets are traded through SIBE.

The Madrid Stock Exchange General Index (IGBM) is the exchange's principal index and represents the construction, financial services, communications, consumer, capital/intermediate goods, energy, and market services sectors. The IBEX 35 Index is a capitalization-weighted index comprising the 35 most liquid Spanish stocks traded in the continuous market, and is Bolsa de Madrid's benchmark. Bolsa de Madrid also offers the FTSE-Latibex Index, a European market for Latin American stocks. The Ibex New Market Index, for emerging companies, was offered from 2000 to 2007.

Settlement is T + 3. Trading on SIBE is conducted from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; open outcry from 10a.m. to 11:30 a.m., both Monday through Friday
