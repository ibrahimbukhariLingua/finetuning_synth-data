### Education

The Institute had one of its major breakthroughs when it introduced Post Graduate Programme in Banking and Finance (PGPBF) in 2003–2004. Dr Bimal Jalan, the then governor, RBI formally launched the PGPBF. This unique course enables the students to possess sound analytical foundation, innovative outlook and practical orientation to the nuances of banking and finance. Keeping in mind the expectations of the banking system, in 2009–2010, the Governing Board of the Institute changed the duration of the course from 1 year to 2 years. In 2013, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), Government of India, granted approval to the Post Graduate Programme, which was then renamed as Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) – Banking and Financial Services. Over almost two decades, NIBM students have been valued for their analytical rigor, quantitative aptitude and pragmatic insights. NIBM- PGDM is very well received by the banking industry and since inception, it has maintained cent per cent students placement in Commercial Banks, Financial Institutions, Rating Agencies, Consulting Firms and related industries.


### Consultancy

Providing consultancy support to banks and financial institutions has always been one of the key strengths of the institute. The focus of our consultancy activities has evolved over time: during the 1970s and 1980s, the focus was more on providing support in organizational design and development, design and implementation of management information systems, manpower planning, etc. With the introduction of the financial sector reforms at the initiative of the RBI and the Government of India in the early 90s, there were increasing demands from commercial banks to assist them in strategic business repositioning, organizational restructuring, human resource development, profitability and productivity strategies, etc. Towards the end of the 1990s, the NIBM took the lead in assisting the banks and financial institutions in setting up their integrated risk management system, asset liability management system, managing market risk, credit risk management system design, etc. Credit Rating for Large Corporate and SMEs developed by NIBM faculty are popular in banks. The institute has also successfully handled the HR issues in the recent merger of various banks. Presently the focus of the consulting activities is more on IRM, designing ICAAP, organizational restructuring, manpower planning, customer relationship management, customer service, etc.
