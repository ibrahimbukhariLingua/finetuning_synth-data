Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance


# Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance



**Volunteers for Economic Growth Alliance** (VEGA) was an umbrella group consisting of 23 economic development organizations that integrate highly skilled volunteers into programs. VEGA is usually contracted by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for specific projects that involve one or more of the Member organizations. The organization was headquartered in Washington, DC and its members have offices around the world in developing/transitioning economies where USAID operates.

The Alliance manages programs across the developing world.
