Dedham Institution for Savings


# Dedham Institution for Savings



**Dedham Savings** is one of the oldest American banks still in operation and one of the oldest banks in the state of Massachusetts still doing business under its original charter.

It is owned by the holding company 1831 Bancorp, which also owns South Shore Bank in Boston.

Deposits at Dedham Savings are insured up to current limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which defines the institution as a community bank. The Depositors Insurance Fund insures all additional balances, up to any amount.


## History

Dedham Savings was incorporated in 1831.

Originally founded as Dedham Institution for Savings on March 19, 1831, the bank has connections to prominent individuals including Horace Mann. Sophia Foord, an acquaintance of Henry David Thoreau, was the bank's first depositor.

On May 4, 1832, The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves opened a bank account at Dedham Savings. This is the oldest active account at Dedham Savings and may be the oldest continuously active account in the United States.

The founder and first president of the bank was Ebenezer Burgess. An early secretary and treasurer of the bank was George Ellis II. Calvin Guild was treasurer of the bank in the 1800s.

In 1832, one year after opening, the Bank's assets totaled nearly $30,000.

In 1942, just over 100 years after opening, assets were nearly $14 million.

In 2023, assets totaled over $2.3 billion.


### Mutual Holding Company

On November 15, 2017, the Dedham Savings Board of Corporators, on the recommendation of the Bank's Trustees and Executive Management, voted to approve the formation of 1831 Bancorp, MHC. The mutuality of Dedham Savings remains intact but resides inside the mutual holding company, which is the sole owner of the now stock savings bank. This action received final regulatory approval in February 2018.

On January 1, 2024, 1831 Bancorp, the Mutual Holding Company parent of Dedham Dedham Savings, and Weymouth, Massachusetts-based South Shore Bancorp, the Mutual Holding Company parent of South Shore Bank, merged under the 1831 Bancorp, MHC name. Both Dedham Savings and South Shore Bank will continue to operate as separately branded banking institutions under the combined holding company.


## Other banking services

Dedham Savings offers a range of financial and electronic banking services to individuals, businesses and organizations. In addition to an array of banking, lending, and commercial products, the bank began offering investment services in 1992. In 2011, Dedham Savings became a partial owner of Plimoth Trust Company, LLC, the parent company of Plimoth Investment Advisors, a portfolio management firm providing investment management, trust, retirement planning services and estate administration for both private and institutional clients.


## Headquarters & locations

The bank was first opened in 1831 at the law office of Treasurer Jonathan H. Cobb at 18 Norfolk Street in Dedham. Three years later, it moved to the basement of the Norfolk County Courthouse. In 1847, it moved to the offices of the Norfolk Mutual Fire Insurance Company at 4 Pearl Street when that building was constructed. It remained there for over 40 years. In the summer of 1892, it opened in a new building the bank constructed at 601-603 High Street. The main branch later moved to 55 Elm Street when the bank built a new, larger building in 1976.

In 1950, the first branch opened in Westwood and the first branch in East Dedham was opened in 1969. Branches were opened in Walpole in 1987, Norwood in 1991, Sharon in 2003, and South Boston in 2016.
