MET Group's main business activity is the trade and wholesale of natural gas. Neue Zürcher Zeitung writes that 70 per cent of the company's revenue come from natural gas sales.

MET is present in 30 national gas markets and 22 international trading hubs. Hungarian business news site napi.hu concludes that MET uses natural gas as a "transition fuel" in the transition from fossil fuel based electric power to electric power from renewable sources.


### Electric power

Since 2014, MET has been operating the biggest natural gas power plant in Hungary, the *Dunamenti Erőmű* in Százhalombatta near Budapest. In 2018, MET Group completed the construction of a solar power plant next to the gas-fired plant. By May 2022, MET Group had two operating solar power plants in Hungary with a power output of over 60 MWₚ, and an additional three solar plants with a combined power output of more than 150 MWₚ under construction. Hungarian magazine NRGreport reports that the solar power plants were financed with so-called "green bonds". The total volume of these bonds is 64.8 billion. Ft (168.5 million. EUR). In early 2021, MET Group acquired the 42 MW Black Sea Wind Park in Bulgaria. This was followed by the 60 MW Suvorovo Wind Park in Bulgaria, in late July 2021. The latter is composed of 30 Gamesa G90 2 MW wind turbines that produce up to 120 GWh of renewable energy annually. In April 2022, MET Group announced that they signed purchase agreements to take over five early-stage greenfield photovoltaic projects in Italy, totalling an expected installed power of 213 MWₚ. The ready-to-build-stage will be reached in 2024. In addition to that, the company bought a 100 per cent stake in a 50 MW solar project in Spain, that will be commissioned in 2023. As a result, the current expected power output of the renewable energy power plants of MET Group (including development-stage and operational-stage projects) is 714 MWₚ.

In 2023, MET entered the German renewables market, with an acquisition of a solar development project in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Keppel MET Renewables, an equal joint venture between MET Group and Keppel, acquired a 100% stake in a photovoltaic project in Italy.
