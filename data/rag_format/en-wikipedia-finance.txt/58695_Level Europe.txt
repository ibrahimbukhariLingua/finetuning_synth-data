Level Europe


# Level Europe



**Level Europe GmbH** was an Austrian airline owned by Vueling, and by extension the International Airlines Group (IAG). It operated short-haul flights within Europe from bases at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and Vienna International Airport sharing the Level brand. The airline's first flight took place on 17 July 2018. The airline filed for insolvency on 18 June 2020, and ceased operations on the same day.


## History

The airline was founded as **Anisec Luftfahrt** (*English*: Anisec Aviation) in November 2017 as a subsidiary of Spanish airline Vueling, originally with intended plans to operate flights from Vienna International Airport under the "Vueling Austria" brand if IAG was successful in acquiring defunct airline Niki and its assets. On 28 June 2018, IAG announced that the subsidiary would operate four Airbus A321 aircraft previously used by Air Berlin under the Level brand, as opposed to the "Vueling Austria" brand as first planned, and would later launch 14 destinations from Vienna from 17 July 2018 through 13 August 2018.

On 14 March 2019, IAG announced plans to use the airline to open a new base at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol beginning from 6 April 2019, with seven routes and three Airbus A320 aircraft to be transferred from Vueling, its parent company, between March and August 2019. In late December 2019, the airline's name was changed from *Anisec Luftfahrt* to **Level Europe**.

In March 2020, Level Europe's fleet was grounded and its operations were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on air travel demand. Before operations were able to resume, the airline announced on 18 June 2020 that it would cease business operations with immediate effect and enter insolvency.


## Destinations
