## History

TeachTown was founded in Seattle, Washington in 2003.

In 2006, TeachTown merged with Animated Speech Corporation. Daniel Feshbach became TeachTown's largest investor and CEO. In 2009, Terry Thoren took on the role of president and CEO. Three years later, Dave Cappellucci assumed the CEO position, with Dan Feshbach remaining as chairman of the board. The company was re-capitalized and TeachTown became a subsidiary of Jigsaw Learning LLC.

Bain Capital acquired TeachTown in 2021 through its Bain Capital Double Impact program. After TeachTown was acquired by Bain Capital, the company welcomed a new Executive Leadership team with Richard Becker serving as CEO.

In June 2024, L Squared Capital Partners acquired TeachTown from Bain Capital Double Impact.
