# Trigo (company)



**Trigo** is a computer vision technology company founded by Michael and Daniel Gabay in 2018. Trigo provides a cashierless shopping solution for grocery retailers to implement partially or fully automated stores.


## History

Trigo was founded in 2018 by Michael and Daniel Gabay. The first pilot began in 2019 with UK grocery retailer Tesco to trial Trigo's cashierless checkout technology at the Tesco employee headquarters in Welwyn Garden, UK, which remains open with Trigoâ€™s technology, as of August 2022.

On October 19, 2021, Trigo launched its second store with Tesco, on High Holborn Street in London, who named the checkout-free store 'GetGo.' In 2021, Trigo also opened stores with retailers REWE in Cologne, Germany on October 26, 2021;, and Netto Marken-Discount in Munich, Germany on December 16, 2021.

In late 2021, Trigo announced a partnership with Aldi Nord and opened its first store in Utrecht, the Netherlands in July, 2022.

In late 2022, Trigo opened an additional store with REWE in Berlin, Germany.

In January 2023, Trigo opened its first store in the United States, partnering with Wakefern Food Corp.

In May 2023 Trigo partnered with Auchan to open a cashless grocery store at its headquarters in Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France.


## Technology and Data Privacy

Trigo claims that their cashierless shopping technology is able to create and manage digital shopping baskets while preserving privacy and data protection. The system operates without using facial recognition or biometric features, and focuses on the tracking of a shopper's journey through the store and their interactions with items within the store.

The personal data of shoppers is transferred to Israel and to "cloud-based service providers" around the world, including the United States. For shoppers located within the European Economic Area (EEA), Trigo claims to employ "appropriate safeguards" to protect personal data when it is transferred outside of the EEA and Israel.


## Funding

Trigo raised $7M in seed funding in 2018, led by Hetz and Vertex Ventures, a $22M series A in 2019, led by Red Dot Ventures, and a $60M series B, led by 83North and included Tesco. In June 2021, Trigo raised an additional $10M in capital from REWE and Viola Ventures. In October 2022 Trigo raised $100M, bringing its total funding to $204M.
