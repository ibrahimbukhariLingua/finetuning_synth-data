# Mitsubishi Electric



**Mitsubishi Electric Corporation** (三菱電機株式会社, *Mitsubishi Denki kabushikigaisha*, formerly branded as メルコ, **MELCO**) is a Japanese multinational electronics and electrical equipment manufacturing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The company was established in 1921 as a spin-off from the electrical machinery manufacturing division of Mitsubishi Shipbuilding (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) at the Kobe Shipyard.

A member of the Mitsubishi Group, Mitsubishi Electric produces elevators and escalators, high-end home appliances, air conditioning, factory automation systems, train systems, electric motors, pumps, semiconductors, digital signage, and satellites.


## History

Mitsubishi Electric was established as a spin-off from the Mitsubishi Group's other core company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, then Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, as the latter divested a marine electric motor factory in Kobe, Nagasaki. It has since diversified to become the major electronics company.

Mitsubishi Electric held the record for the fastest elevator in the world, in the 70-story Yokohama Landmark Tower, from 1993 to 2005.

The company acquired Nihon Kentetsu, a Japanese home appliance manufacturer, in 2005.

In 2015 the company acquired DeLclima, an Italian company that designs and produces HVAC and HPAC units, renamed Mitsubishi Electric Hydronics & IT Cooling Systems SpA in 2017.

In early 2020, Mitsubishi Electric was identified as a victim of the year-long cyberattacks perpetrated by the Chinese hackers.

In 2023, Mitsubishi Electric announced its plans to spend 100 billion yen to build a new semiconductor factory in Kumamoto Prefecture, with a target date of April 2026 to begin production.
