Lakh


# Lakh



A **lakh** (/læk, lɑːk/; abbreviated **L**; sometimes written **lac**) is a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to one hundred thousand (100,000; scientific notation: 10⁵). In the Indian 2, 2, 3 convention of digit grouping, it is written as 1,00,000. For example, in India, 150,000 rupees becomes 1.5 *lakh* rupees, written as ₹1,50,000 or INR 1,50,000.

It is widely used both in official and other contexts in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It is often used in Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan English.


## Usage

In Indian English, the word is used both as an attributive and non-attributive noun with either an unmarked or marked ("-s") plural, respectively. For example: "1 *lakh* people"; "*lakhs* of people"; "20 *lakh* rupees"; "*lakhs* of rupees". In the abbreviated form, usage such as "₹5L" or "₹5 lac" (for "5 *lakh* rupees") is common. In this system of numeration, 100 *lakh* is called one *crore* and is equal to 10 million.

Formal written publications in English in India tend to use lakh/crore for Indian currency and Western numbering for foreign currencies, such as dollars and pounds.


### Silver market

The term is also used in the pricing of silver on the international precious metals market, where one *lakh* equals 100,000 troy ounces (3,100 kilograms) of silver.


## Etymology and regional variants

The modern word *lakh* derives from Sanskrit: लक्ष, romanized: *lakṣa*, originally denoting "mark, target, stake in gambling", but also used as the numeral for "100,000" in Gupta-era Classical Sanskrit (*Yājñavalkya Smṛti*, *Harivaṃśa*).
