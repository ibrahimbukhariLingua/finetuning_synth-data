## History

Dickinson Wright was founded in 1878 by two young lawyers, Henry Munroe Campbell and Henry Russel.

Members of the firm were involved in drafting the state of Michigan's two constitutions in 1908 and 1963. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt closed banks nationwide during the banking crisis of 1933, the firm helped organize the new federally-funded National Bank of Detroit (now JPMorgan Chase & Co.) that helped stabilize the state's banking system and end a 36-day bank holiday.

The firm began expanding outside of Michigan in 1978 with the opening of the firm's Washington, D.C. office. Since then, the firm has added five additional offices in Michigan (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Saginaw, and Troy). In the late 2000s, the firm added offices in Toronto, Phoenix, and Nashville. The firm expanded the Toronto office in 2011, the Phoenix office in 2013, and the Las Vegas, NV office in 2015. The firm opened new offices in Columbus, OH in 2012 and Lexington (KY) in 2015. Fort Lauderdale, FL and Austin, TX offices were added in 2016. The El Paso, TX office opened in July 2017, and the Silicon Valley office in 2018. On January 1, 2021, the firm expanded by opening a Chicago office through the acquisition of Stahl Cowen Crowley Addis LLC. In 2023, the firm continued its growth by launching its 20th office in Denver, Colorado. This momentum carried into 2024, with the firm establishing new offices in San Diego and officially opening its Windsor location.

Around the late 1980s and early 1990s, because of the increase in Japanese companies in Metro Detroit, Dickinson Wright (then Dickinson, Wright, Moon, Van Dusen & Freeman) hired a Japanese paralegal and two Japanese lawyers. With its new employees it began publishing a Japanese-language newsletter for Japanese clients and began conducting Japanese-language seminars.

The firm adopted its current name, Dickinson Wright PLLC, when it established itself as a professional limited liability company in January 1998.
