Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983


# Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983



The **Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983** (c. 59) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which exempted certain petroleum licence holders of new offshore oil and gas fields from the payment of petroleum royalties or the delivery of petroleum.


## Background

In the Budget statement in 1983 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced changes to the taxation in the oil industry. He noted that Government had a responsibility to compare the likely returns from future development both to the Government and to the industry, and had to ensure that the country obtained the appropriate benefit.

The demarcation line between the direct benefit to the nation and the benefit to the oil and gas industry work was such that, after the Budget measures and taxation proposals and the measures in this Act the nation would obtain the majority of the benefit. Petroleum revenue tax was 75 per cent, and corporation tax was 52 per cent. The measures in this Act meant that benefit from other discoveries and developments will benefit the nation as a whole. As a result of the application of royalties for future developments outside the southern basin of the North Sea, the marginal tax rate for a field paying petroleum revenue tax will be reduced from 89.5 to 88 per cent.

Oil production increased and the Government's revenue from North Sea taxation in 1984/5 was £12 billion or 8 per cent of total tax revenue.

In response to the oil price fall in 1986 the Government reduced taxation further by enacting the *Advance Petroleum Revenue Tax Act 1986.*
