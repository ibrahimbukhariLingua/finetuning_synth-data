## History

Van Wijngen was established as a small company owned by Martien van Wijngen since 1985. Back then, Van Wijngen transported fresh fruits and vegetables from the farmers in Spain, the Netherlands and France. There was a high demand of fruits and vegetables to be delivered on time so that the farmers would get the highest market price.

As time went by, the transportation of (common) products had become the focus of the company.


## Location

The head office of Van Wijngen International is located on the industrial terrain in Hazeldonk, Breda. A second office has French employees and is based in Valenciennes, France.


## Bankruptcy in 2010

Van Wijgen suffered severe consequences of the 2008 economic crisis. The company had to cut down staff and reduce the number of own trucks. However, by 2013, things had picked up for the company and in 2016 an important increase in capacity was announced.
