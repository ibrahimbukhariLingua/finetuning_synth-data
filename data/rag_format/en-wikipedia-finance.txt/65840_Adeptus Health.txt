## Class action lawsuit

In 2016, a class action lawsuit was filed against Adeptus Health (as well as members of the Company’s board of directors, Sterling Partners, and the joint book-running managers in the Company’s secondary public offering of shares of its Class A common stock) by purchasers of its securities alleging that the company violated the federal securities laws and made false and/or misleading statements, failing to disclose its internal control over financial reporting and the overall status of its business operations. The case is *Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System v. Adeptus Health Inc.*, before Judge Amos L. Mazzant III in the Eastern District of Texas, and is under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The settlement included all entities and investors who purchased Adeptus Class A common stock from 2014 to 2017.

In 2017, a man from Colorado sued Adeptus and sought class action status involving the facility fees it charged patients. It was alleged that the company took advantage of marketplace confusion and defrauded consumers through its failure to disclose excessive costs.
