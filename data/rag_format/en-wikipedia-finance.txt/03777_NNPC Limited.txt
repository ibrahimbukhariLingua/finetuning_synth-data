The NNPC, with an asset of $153B (USD), is the largest national oil company in Africa. The company boasts of extensive infrastructure and investment in the downstream, midstream and upstream of the Nigerian petroleum industry.


## History

NNPC by law manages the joint venture between the Nigerian federal government and a number of foreign multinational corporations, which include Royal Dutch Shell, Agip, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies, Chevron, and Texaco (now merged with Chevron). Through collaboration with these companies, the Nigerian government conducts petroleum exploration and production.

The NNPC Towers, located in Abuja, serves as the headquarters of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).

In December 2021, the Federal Government of Nigeria and NNPC Ltd signed a ₦621 billion Memorandum of Understanding to finance the construction of critical road infrastructure across the country.

Following passage of a Petroleum Industry Act in August 2021, NNPC now operates as a commercial entity without relying on government funding and direct controls. NNPC was established as a limited liability corporation in the hopes that a private entity will find it easier to access international capital markets.
