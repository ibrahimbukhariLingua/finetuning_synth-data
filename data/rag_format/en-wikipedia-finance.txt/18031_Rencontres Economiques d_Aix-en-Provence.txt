Rencontres Economiques d'Aix-en-Provence


# Rencontres Economiques d'Aix-en-Provence



The **Rencontres Économiques d'Aix-en-Provence** is an economic forum organized by Le Cercle des économistes since 2001, in the city of Aix-en-Provence, France.


## Organization

Free and public, this forum brings together business leaders, academics, international organizations, NGOs, politicians and students for three days of discussion.

Les Rencontres Économiques d’Aix-en-Provence has as its goal to vitalize economic debate at the French, European and international levels. Organized each year around an economic and social theme, these three days of discussion aspire not only to contribute to a better public understanding of economic problems, but also to identify which policy alternatives should best be put into effect. Les Rencontres are also an exercise in intellectual exploration culminating at the end of the conference in a joint public statement by the members of Le Cercle des économistes.

The sessions and debates can be followed on the official website of les Rencontres Économiques d'Aix-en-Provence and then on its YouTube channel. Each year, over a hundred journalists from a dozen countries cover the event.
