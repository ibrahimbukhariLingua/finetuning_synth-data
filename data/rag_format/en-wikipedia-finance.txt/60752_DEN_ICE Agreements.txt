DEN/ICE Agreements


# DEN/ICE Agreements



The **DEN/ICE Agreements** are a series of multilateral treaties that provide for the joint financing of air traffic control, communications, and meteorological services in Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands for civil aircraft crossing the North Atlantic Ocean above the 45th parallel north. The agreements were negotiated and are implemented within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations.


## History

The first joint financing agreement for North Atlantic travel—the Agreement on Joint Financing of Weather Ships on the North Atlantic—was concluded in September 1946. The next year, in April 1947, Canada, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed to jointly finance the continued operation of a LORAN station in Vík, Iceland, that had been established by the British during the Second World War. At Denmark's request, similar agreements were struck in 1949 to allow for joint funding of stations in Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

In 1956, the **Agreement on the Joint Financing of Certain Air Navigation Services In Iceland** and the **Agreement on the Joint Financing of Certain Air Navigation Services In Greenland and the Faroe Islands** were concluded in Geneva and were opened to any state that wishes to participate in the funding of aviation services for the North Atlantic. Both agreement entered into force in June 1958. The agreements were updated and amended in 1982 and 2008. The ICAO is the depositary for the agreements.


## Financing arrangements

Under the agreements, Iceland and Denmark contribute five per cent of the operating costs of the aviation services. Since 1974, the operators of aircraft crossing the North Atlantic have been assessed user charges. Any amount that remains to be funded is paid by the states parties to the agreements. Each state party is allocated a percentage of the remaining total which is based on a percentage of North Atlantic crossings that are performed by commercial airlines located in the state.

In 2003, the cost of the arrangements was US$26.7 million; close to 80 per cent of the total funded the services in Iceland, with the remainder going to Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
