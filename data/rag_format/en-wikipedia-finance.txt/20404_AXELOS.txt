AXELOS


# AXELOS



**AXELOS** is a joint venture set up in 2014 by the Government of the United Kingdom and Capita, to develop, manage and operate qualifications in best practice, in methodologies formerly owned by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). PeopleCert, an examination institute that was responsible for delivering AXELOS exams, acquired AXELOS in 2021.

There are third-party training providers, but Axelos manages certification. In April 2014, AXELOS announced that it was also launching a cyber-resilience qualification; this would complement guidance available from CESG.

PeopleCert have been chosen by AXELOS as the sole EI (Examination Institute) for the delivery of Accreditation and Examination services worldwide, starting 1 January 2018.


## Background

The portfolio was originally developed for UK government, and is valuable; the government periodically requests tenders for private-sector partners to manage it. Historically, this had been APMG. However, in April 2013 Capita won the contract, under a new arrangement which required them to invest in a joint venture. Capita hold a 51% majority stake, the Cabinet Office the remaining 49%. This joint venture, AXELOS, was formed in July 2013, and it took over from APMG on 1 January 2014.
