Direct, indirect, and induced employment


# Direct, indirect, and induced employment



Investments into an industry or project can produce temporary and long-term employment. The resulting jobs are typically categorized as being one of three types. A **direct job** is employment created to fulfill the demand for a product or service. An **indirect job** is a job that exists to produce the goods and services needed by the workers with direct jobs. Indirect employment includes the things need direct on the job as well as jobs produced because of the worker's needs (e.g., uniforms). Employment created by the additional personal spending (e.g., eating at a restaurant) by both direct and indirect workers is classified as an **induced job**.

Projects may produce temporary and long-term jobs. Construction and installation jobs may be temporary. Operations and maintenance jobs tend to be long term.


## Examples

| Project | Direct jobs | Indirect jobs | Induced jobs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Use wind turbines | Employees manufacturing wind turbines | * Employees at a steel mill that supplies the wind turbine factory * Employees producing energy used by the steel mill * Employees at a factory that makes the screws used in wind turbines | * Restaurant staff * Child care workers * Grocery store jobs * Clothing store jobs * Recreation and entertainment jobs |
| Build a water treatment facility | * Construction workers building the facility * Employees operating equipment at the facility | * Employees at a factory that makes chemicals used at the facility * Workers who wash the facility's uniforms at an industrial laundry |
| Tourism | Service job selling tickets to a park | * Employees at fast-food restaurant * Cashiers at retail stores * Hotel employees |
| Retrofitting buildings to be energy efficient | Construction job to install new heating system | * Employees who manufacture building supplies * Employees who assemble heating systems |


## Efficiency of job production

Investments in some projects or industries are more efficient at producing direct and indirect jobs. For example, investing US$1,000,000 in the petroleum industry produces fewer direct and indirect jobs than investing the same amount of money in renewable energy or energy efficiency.

A special economic zone produces fewer indirect jobs if it is isolated from the country's main economy, and more if it is well integrated. For example, the special economic zone in the Dominican Republic provided 166,000 formal direct jobs plus 250,000 indirect jobs in 2017.
