## History

PAPAYA Global was founded in 2016, by Eynat Guez, Ruben Drong, and Ofer Herman. The company raised $1.5 million in June 2016. In November 2019, the company raised $45 million in a Series A funding round led by Insight Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners. In September 2020, Papaya Global secured an additional $40 million in Series B funding, led by Scale Venture Partners and Workday Ventures. This investment aimed at further developing the company's technology and expanding its market reach.

The following year, in March 2021, Papaya Global raised $100 million in a Series C funding round led by GreenOaks Capital Partners, with participation from IVP and Alkeon. This round valued the company at over $1 billion. In September 2021, Papaya Global raised $250 million in Series D funding, bringing the company's valuation to $3.7 billion. This round was led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management and supported the continued expansion of PAPAYA Global's services and the scaling of its global operations.

In March 2022, Papaya Global acquired Azimo. The acquisition, completed in March 2022, provided Papaya Global with licenses for payment services in multiple regions, including the UK, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong.

In March 2023, the company underwent a rebranding, and in 2024 it launched the Super Bowl Campaign under the tagline "Small Balls. Big Game." It was an unexpected move by a B2B tech company to advertise in a mostly B2C arena like the Super Bowl. The ad launched Papaya as a payments company and was supported by parallel and digital campaigns.
