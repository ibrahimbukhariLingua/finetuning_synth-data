Unified Payments Interface


# Unified Payments Interface



**Unified Payments Interface** (**UPI**) is an Indian instant payment system as well as protocol developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. The interface facilitates inter-bank peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. It is used on mobile devices to instantly transfer funds between two bank accounts. The mobile number of the device is required to be registered with the bank. The UPI ID of the recipient can be used to transfer money. It runs as an open source application programming interface (API) on top of the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), and is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Indian Banks started making their UPI-enabled apps available on Google Play on 25 August 2016.

With UPI, India maintains its position as the global leader in instant payments, accounting for 46% of all global instant payment transactions in 2022. As of November 2022, the platform had over 300 million monthly active users in India. According to data from the NPCI, 12.20 billion UPI transactions worth ₹18.41 lakh crore (equivalent to $222.17 billion) were processed in January 2024, representing a 41.72% increase in transaction value compared to January 2023. In 2023, the total annual value of UPI transactions in India reached ₹182 lakh crore (equivalent to $2.2 trillion), reflecting a 59% increase in transaction volume and 45% increase in transaction value compared to 2022. UPI transactions in July 2024 averaged ₹1,430 per transfer, with the system processing 5,390 payments every second. The success of UPI made it a soft power tool for India. It became one of the most successful deep-tech financial innovations India has produced.


## History

In April 2009, the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) was formed to integrate all the payment mechanisms in India and make them uniform for all retail payments. By March 2009, RBI found out that in India, only six non-cash transactions were executed each year by individual citizens while 1 crore (10 million) retailers accepted card-based payments. Around 14.5 crores (145 million) families had no access to any form of banking. There was also the problem of tackling black money and corruption that happened mostly in cash.

RBI in 2014 released a vision statement for a period of four years that indicated commitment towards building a safe, efficient, accessible, inclusive, interoperable, and authorized payment and settlement system in India. It was also part of the Green Initiative to decrease the usage of paper in the domestic payments market. UPI was officially launched in 2016 for public use.

Under RBI guidance, NPCI became the primary body tasked with developing a new payment system that is simple, secure, and interoperable. UPI works on a four-pillar push-pull interoperable model where there will be a remitter/beneficiary front-end PSP (payment service provider) and a remitter/beneficiary back-end bank that settles the monetary transaction for the users. According to the CEO of Netmagic Solutions, UPI became one of the most successful deep-tech financial innovations India has produced.

In December 2019, noting the success of UPI, Google suggested that the US Federal Reserve Board should follow UPI as an example in developing FedNow, a real-time payment system for the United States.

With the exponential growth of UPI, India became the world's largest real-time payment market with 25.5 billion annual transactions in 2020 as per data from ACI Worldwide and GlobalData. This put the country ahead of China, South Korea, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

As per the Economist Intelligence Unit Report 2021, UPI has made India a leader in the global real-time payment market followed by China and South Korea. After the decision of the Ministry of Finance to nullify the merchant discount rate (MDR) in 2019 from UPI, the number of low value transactions skyrocketed, making huge gains on real-time transaction volume data. Countries such as Brazil, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United States, and the European Union are exploring options to implement a UPI-like system in their own domestic markets.

From 1 January 2019, UPI became a popular payment option for initial public offerings (IPOs). The transaction limit was enhanced from ₹100,000 to ₹200,000 in March 2020. From December 2021, RBI again increased the limit to ₹500,000 for Retail Direct Scheme and IPO applications. To make UPI economically feasible for payment companies, RBI is considering a merchant discount rate (MDR) on future UPI transactions. In its first monetary policy for the 2022–23 financial year, RBI proposed a cardless cash withdrawal facility from ATMs using UPI-based QR codes. In partnership with the NSDL Payments Bank and NPCI, ToneTag launched VoiceSE which will enable 40 crores (400 million) feature phone users to make UPI payments using voice in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Bengali languages.

According to Redseer Strategy Consultants, in 2023, UPI usage has expanded outside of metro areas. Currently, around 70% of UPI users are from places other than Tier-1 cities. Furthermore, over 80% of newly registered users originate from Tier-2 cities and other nearby areas. On 8 August 2024, RBI suggested raising the UPI tax payment ceiling from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh.


### UPI 2.0

On 16 August 2018, UPI 2.0 was launched, which enabled users to link their overdraft accounts to a UPI handle. Users were also able to pre-authorise transactions by issuing a mandate for a specific merchant. This version also included a feature to view and store an invoice for each transaction. An AutoPay facility for recurring payments was also added. As of August 2021, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Paytm Payments Bank have been live on UPI AutoPay, each registering 660,000, 204,000, and 186,000 mandates, respectively. From 15 March 2022, the government removed the need for debit cards for UPI registration. NPCI is planning to expand AutoPay to international markets and operationalize real-time payment dispute resolution mechanisms covering 90% of the complaints by September 2022.

From 8 June 2022, RBI allowed linking RuPay credit cards with UPI. Customers can now make credit card payments using UPI, in the absence of a physical card. NPCI developed a real-time feature that will reduce the 24-hour time period taken by banks to unblock funds over time-out or transaction declines to 30 seconds. The service was officially launched on 20 September 2022. On 7 December 2022, RBI announced that UPI will upgrade from single-block-single to single-block-multiple debit for recurring transactions and investments in securities. This feature is expected to help users block funds for specific purposes and release them when needed.

RBI on 6 April 2023 proposed allowing credit on UPI through pre-approved bank lines which would help customers reduce their dependence on credit cards. On its point-of-sale devices, Razorpay introduced a quick refund feature for UPI in 2024. Compared to the industry average of five to six business days, the reimbursement will be initiated within 2 minutes.

After introducing the first card-less UPI automated teller machine (ATM), Hitachi Payment Services is now working on creating a UPI-based cash recycler machine (CRM). It will operate on UPI ATMs' opposite principle. The Reserve Bank of India and the National Payments Corporation of India are collaborating with the company to explore the feasibility of permitting deposits based on UPI. On August 29, 2024, during the Global Fintech Fest, RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar introduced the UPI Interoperable Cash Deposit (UPI-ICD) feature for cash recycler machine.

International mobile numbers of ICICI Bank's non-resident Indian clients can be used to make UPI payments in India. In ten nations—the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia—the bank provides this service.


#### UPI 123PAY

As part of a financial inclusion initiative, NPCI with fintech start-up Naffa Innovations with their product ToneTag in 2021 started working on developing a voice-based payment service for feature phone users in low connectivity zones over UPI payment ecosystem under Interactive Voice Response (IVR) project. The system utilised Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signalling technology with two-factor authentication (2FA) flow for peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction. From September 2020 to June 2021, it was under beta testing while awaiting RBI approval for large-scale deployment. The beta testing and pilot experiment were completed by October 2021 and RBI started formulating guidelines for nationwide use.

The RBI governor Shaktikanta Das launched the service called UPI 123PAY on 8 March 2022, with an aim to help almost 40 crores (400 million) feature phone users in the country. Till now, UPI payments were only possible through payment applications on smartphones and USSD-based service for feature phones. However, as per Deputy Governor T Rabi Shankar, the latter has been found to be cumbersome due to the unavailability of the services on several mobile networks.

UPI 123PAY has four options for payment.

1. App-based functionality where a mobile phone manufacturer can install a UPI app through over-the-air programming, that can be used for payment.
2. Missed calls based: where a customer can use a dedicated merchant payment number by giving a missed call. The incoming authentication call will ask for PIN verification to complete the transaction.
3. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) based where the payment transaction will be completed using pre-defined phone numbers.
4. Payment in offline mode through sound-based proximity data communication.

As per NPCI, some of the early use cases involve FASTag recharges, insurance payments, and EMI collections. As of 20 September 2022, Ultracash Technologies in collaboration with Bharat Petroleum helped 200,000 active users make LPG booking and payment through UPI 123PAY. As of October 9, 2024, the RBI increased the transaction limit from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000. Banks and service providers have until January 1, 2025, to make the required adjustments.


### UPI 3.0

NPCI started introducing new features under UPI 3.0 from 2024.


#### Conversational Voice Payments

At the **Global Fintech Fest 2024**, NPCI, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), and CoRover unveiled "Conversational Voice Payments" for UPI, a huge advancement in the convenience of online transactions. Customers may now use their voice or type their UPI ID or mobile number to complete transactions thanks to this new functionality that is enabled by BharatGPT and linked with payment gateways. The system immediately obtains the associated UPI ID and starts the payment request through the user's default UPI app when a mobile number is entered. Users can update their UPI ID or mobile number within the transaction time restriction thanks to this functionality, which enables flexibility. The goal of this innovative technology, which is the first of its type for UPI payments, is to reduce linguistic barriers and increase the accessibility and human-centeredness of transactions. With support for Hindi, Gujarati, and other languages, CoRover's voice-enabled BharatGPT improves the multilingual system and guarantees inclusion in the payment process. Users of AskDISHA, the AI virtual assistant for Indian Railways and IRCTC, can now buy tickets and make payments with just their voice thanks to the integration of Conversational Voice Payments.


#### Credit lines

The RuPay credit card on UPI facility is responsible for credit transactions of ₹10,000 crore per month. Approximately 100 to 200 crores of the ₹10,000 crore in credit card spending through UPI have been made through credit lines, according to NPCI MD and CEO Dilip Asbe. The pre-approved, small-ticket, short-term loans on UPI are called credit lines. On July 19, 2024, The New Indian Express published an article stating that Punjab National Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India, and ICICI Bank had already started using the UPI credit line product on a trial basis. When it comes to granting pre-approved loans through credit lines on UPI, ICICI Bank is the industry leader.

On August 23, 2024, PhonePe introduced the "Credit Line on UPI" service. It makes low-cost, high-volume retail loans available.


#### UPI Vouchers

Google Pay revealed at the **Global Fintech Fest 2024** that it will be launching UPI Vouchers, a capability that was first made available for COVID-19 vaccine payments. This feature will be released in the second half of 2024. With UPI Vouchers, users can transfer prepaid vouchers that are connected to the smartphone number of the recipient. The recipient of these vouchers does not need to connect their bank account to UPI in order to use them for payments. It is now possible for businesses and individuals to issue and use UPI vouchers more easily thanks to the adaptation of this feature for a wider range of industries. In addition to making financial transactions for users easier, UPI Vouchers offer a smooth digital payment option for a variety of scenarios, including corporate gifts, government programs, and others.


#### UPI Circle

In its monetary policy announcement in August 2024, the RBI implemented the delegated payments feature through UPI. By doing this, a person (the primary user) could grant permission to another person (the secondary user) to utilize their bank account to perform UPI transactions. The primary user would choose the transaction limit.

The UPI Circle feature was launched on 19 August 2024. Two kinds of delegation are possible with UPI Circle. Full delegation, in which the primary user gives the secondary user the authority to start and finish transactions up to specified expenditure limitations without needing additional permission. Additionally, there is partial delegation, in which the primary user must authenticate and complete the payment using their UPI PIN before the secondary user may start a transaction. With UPI Circle, one can use platforms for collaboration or gig economies to create micro-communities where people can pool resources or settle payments in real time. On August 22, 2024, PhonePe released the feature on its platform. At the **Global Fintech Fest 2024**, Google Pay announced that it will be introducing the UPI Circle feature. The second half of 2024 will see the release of this feature.

NPCI guidelines for UPI ecosystem members,

* For Primary and Secondary users, separate user journeys are provided by payment service providers and UPI apps. Users are allowed to select the UPI app of their choosing. App passcodes and biometrics (facial and/or fingerprint) must be required for all secondary users.
* The primary user must first select a contact number from the contact list and then scan the QR code or input their UPI ID in order to link. Eventually, primary users will be able to connect with secondary users by choosing a contact number from the contact list alone, rather than scanning a QR code.
* Up to five secondary users may be delegated by a primary user, and only one primary user may accept delegation from a secondary user. Members must make sure that, in cases of full or partial delegation, the primary user grants permission to the secondary user.
* Members are responsible for making sure the principal user has restricted access to set use limits for their secondary users. Members must guarantee a maximum monthly limit of approximately 15,000 per delegate and a maximum per transaction limit of approximately 5,000 for full delegation.
* The current UPI restrictions will apply in the event of partial delegation. Members are responsible for making sure that, following the successful connection of primary and secondary users for both full and partial delegation, a daily transaction limit of about 5,000 is set for the first 24 hours of the cooling period.
* Members are required to make certain that transactions made by secondary users are visible to the primary user on their bank account statement and UPI app.
* Members must abide by RBI regulations regarding "Harmonization of Turn Around Time" and compensating customers for unsuccessful transactions through authorized payment methods. UPI transactions must provide online dispute resolution capabilities.

## Service

For real-time payments from one bank account to another, any UPI client app can be used and multiple bank accounts can be linked to a single app. Money can be sent or requested using a user-created Virtual Payment Address (VPA) or UPI ID for each bank account using the KYC-linked mobile number. UPI also generates a specific QR code for each user account for contactless payments. The RBI increased the UPI payment limit for payments in hospitals and educational institutions from ₹100,000 to ₹500,000 on 8 December 2023. Multi-factor authentication for UPI e-mandates will now be activated over ₹100,000, as opposed to ₹15,000, for credit card repayments, mutual fund subscriptions, and insurance premium payments.


### Mobile apps

Any UPI app can be used to transfer funds from and to UPI enabled banks. Apart from various third-party apps such as Google Pay (previously Tez), PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, Airtel Payments Bank, MobiKwik, Samsung Pay, WhatsApp Pay, NPCI manages its own app, BHIM.

The total number of banks linked to UPI platform grew from 21 in April 2016 to 304 in February 2022.

In June 2021, NPCI removed the restriction placed on WhatsApp for UPI customer onboarding which until then was limited to 2 crore (20 million) users. With 53 crores (530 million) registered users in the Indian market, WhatsApp could then roll out UPI to all its customers. In place of the present four- or six-digit UPI PIN, NPCI proposed forming collaborations with startups to implement biometric identification for UPI transactions utilizing fingerprints on Android smartphones and face ID on iPhones.


#### Foreign tourists

There are multiple apps that allow foreign tourists to make UPI payments including one by NPCI called UPI one world


#### On-Device wallet

NPCI called this feature **UPI Lite**. It can scan QR code without the need of an internet connection. In phase 1, UPI Lite will process the debit transaction offline while the credit will happen when the device goes online. But the final goal is to achieve both credit and debit transaction through offline mode. The upper limit of UPI Lite On-Device wallet is ₹2,000. Additional factor authentication or UPI AutoPay feature will be used to securely load the desirable amount. Since 50% of UPI transactions are below ₹200 with a higher frequency rate, the per transaction limit will be maximum ₹200, as it creates a large backlog of volume which increases the failure rate and affects the stability of the entire payment network. To save electricity consumption and computing power of banks, UPI mobile apps will have to support on-device wallet features as per the RBI directive from December 2021. The in-built wallet will help in low-value instant payment by using the infrastructure of the mobile app developer, thus decreasing the load on banks through decentralization of back-end infrastructure and resources.

On 20 September, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das officially launched UPI Lite at **Global Fintech Fest 2022**. Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Union Bank of India and Utkarsh Small Finance Bank enabled UPI Lite feature on BHIM. Paytm Payments Bank on 15 February 2023 went live with UPI Lite feature.

Beginning November 1, 2024, the UPI Lite auto top-up feature will allow the balance to be automatically replenished when it drops below a certain threshold. The user is responsible for setting the minimum balance and reload amount, which cannot be greater than the ₹2,000 wallet limit. The UPI Lite account can be topped-up up to five times in a single day. Users using UPI Lite are currently able to transact up to ₹500 each. Furthermore, ₹2,000 is the maximum amount that can be stored in a UPI Lite wallet. For users of UPI Lite wallets, the cumulative maximum daily expenditure limit has been set at ₹4,000. It has been suggested by the RBI that the UPI Lite maximum transaction limit be raised from ₹500 to ₹1,000. The UPI Lite wallet limit has also been raised from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000.


### Supported banks

The NPCI website lists the banks that facilitate UPI, termed as Payment Service Providers (PSP) – listed with their UPI application and handle – and issuers. PSP includes banks which have their own mobile application to facilitate transaction and issuers include banks which don't have their own payments interface and rely on third-party software for transactions. On 1 August 2024, RBL Bank announced integration of UPI and National Common Mobility Card capabilities with RuPay credit cards.


### e-RUPI

e-RUPI or e₹UPI *(portmanteau of **e**lectronic **R**upee and **UPI**)* developed in collaboration with Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and National Health Authority. It was introduced from 2 August 2021. e-RUPI is to ensure leak proof delivery of welfare services and bypassing middle man to decrease corruption. Private sector can use the service for their own corporate social responsibility initiative (CSR). e-RUPI is basically e-voucher based on QR code or SMS string that can be delivered through mobile phone. e-RUPI will act as a precursor for future Central bank digital currency (CBDC) that will be launched by RBI as it will help in highlighting the gaps within the national digital payment infrastructure.

Financial Software and Systems (FSS) integrated e-RUPI on 1 December 2021 for financially underserved segments of the society. Government of Karnataka partnered with NPCI to provide student scholarship through e-RUPI which can even be received on feature phones.


### Digital Rupee

As part of the Central Bank Digital Currency pilot project, Canara Bank has released the Unified Payments Interface compatible digital rupee mobile app. Without the need for a separate on-boarding procedure for CBDC for retailers, it will enable users to scan the existing UPI QR code and make payments using digital rupee. Customers in 26 Indian cities who have been whitelisted can access the service as part of a pilot program.


## Market share

### Market cap

On 26 March 2021, NPCI defined standard operating procedure for third-party payment providers on 30% market cap. The limit will be calculated on the basis of total volume of transactions processed over UPI during the preceding three months on a rolling basis starting from 1 January 2021. Compliance deadline is until December 2023. NPCI will push first alert through an email or a letter to third-party payment providers and their partner banks when UPI transactions hits 25–27% threshold which payment providers must acknowledge. In return, payment providers will send second alert to NPCI with evidence on the steps taken for compliance. In case 30% mark is breached, payment providers and banks must stop new user on-boarding. In special cases, payment providers and banks may get an exemption of 6 months for compliance. The report of breaching 30% market cap must reach NPCI within first five working days with plan for corrective measures. During the same period, payment providers and banks must inform new customers about the issue. Non compliance of market cap bring penalties under UPI procedural guidelines. NPCI will check operating procedures of UPI every 6 months to meet objectives without creating inconvenience for end users.

PhonePe made a formal request to NPCI to defer 30% market cap deadline from January 2023 to January 2026. NPCI is discussing this issue with RBI and Government. Industry stakeholders want to do away with 30% market cap proposed by NPCI, instead want organic growth based on customer demand. Implementation is another contentious issue since it results in blocking existing users from performing payment to maintain 30% market cap which is not feasible from business point of view. RBI also started looking for solutions to fix the duopoly situation created by Google Pay and PhonePe. Both the players will get two additional years till 31 December 2024 to fix their market cap.


## Internationalization

Around 777 million Indian consumers shopped across the border in 2021.

Bank Indonesia involved as a special observer. The platform, which is expected to go live by 2026, will interlink domestic fast payment systems of the member countries.


## Studies on UPI

This digital revolution brought about by UPI has also led to a significant influx of scams and fraudulent activities. As more users adopt this convenient payment system, scammers have increasingly exploited vulnerabilities in digital transactions. One reason why scammers adopt this method is, it's almost impossible to reverse the transaction. As per RBI's annual report in 2023-24, 29,082 digital frauds (card/internet) were reported amounting to ₹ 1457 crore.

The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, Indian School of Business, Fuqua School of Business (Duke University), and the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) conducted a joint study titled Open Banking and Digital Payments: Implications for Credit Access. They found that UPI has made it possible for underserved borrowers to obtain formal credit for the first time. In areas where UPI adoption is high, loans to new credit borrowers have increased by 4%, while loans to subprime borrowers have increased by 8%. As an example of how digital financial records helped lenders better evaluate applicants, the authors pointed out that a 10% increase in UPI transactions resulted in a 7% increase in credit availability. UPI-enabled digital transaction data helped lenders grow responsibly, as evidenced by the fact that default rates did not increase despite the lending boom.
