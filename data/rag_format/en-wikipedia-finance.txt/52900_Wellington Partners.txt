# Wellington Partners



**Wellington Partners** is a pan-European venture capital firm with some €800 million under management and offices in London, Munich and Zurich.

## History

In 1991, Rolf Dienst founded Wellington Partners after he had built one of the first - and still one of the largest - German venture capital firms, TVM Capital, during the 1980s. In 1998, Wellington Partners closed its first fund, Wellington Partners I. Two years later, the firm closed its second fund on €210 million. After considering suggestions from investors, Wellington Partners initiated its first pure technology fund with €150 million in 2004 and its first life sciences fund in 2006. At the beginning of 2008, the company closed its latest technology fund at €265 million.
