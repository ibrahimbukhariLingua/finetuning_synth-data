Delivery Performance


# Delivery Performance



**Delivery performance** (DP) is a broadly used standard KPI measurement in supply chains to measure the fulfillment of a customer's demand to the wish date. Following the nomenclature of the DR-DP-Matrix three main approaches to measure DP can be distinguished:

* {\displaystyle DP\_{T}^{V}}
* {\displaystyle DP\_{D}^{S}}
* {\displaystyle DP\_{T}^{S}}

## Volume/on time


### Formula

If ({\displaystyle (Demand\_{p,c}+Backlog\_{p-1,c})>0})

Else

Demand:= customers wish
c:= product identifier
p:= Time period e.g. a day, a week, a month ...

The cumulation over a period and a group of product identifiers c is done as follows:
{\displaystyle DP\_{p,c}={\frac {\sum \_{p,c}(DP\_{T}^{V})}{count\_{p,c}(DP\_{T}^{V}<>NULL)}}}

whereas p is determined by demand period


## Singular/delivery and singular/on time


### Singular case definition

To fit to the needs of the environment, the granularity of a singular case ({\displaystyle DP\_{\*}^{S}}) has to be defined. In general a singular case is described by a n-Tuple consisting of a set of the following order and delivery details:

* order number
* customer identifier
* product identifier
* wish date of customer
* confirmed date of supplier
* ship to information
* delivery date
* delivery note number

### Formula

* **{\displaystyle DP\_{D}^{S}}**

arrival date = delivery date + transit time

By cumulating the results of singular cases over a certain period p and, if necessary, additional criteria c (e.g. customer, product, ...) the delivery performance is calculated as follows:

{\displaystyle DP\_{p,c}={\frac {\sum \_{p,c}(DP)}{count\_{p,c}(singularcases)}}}

whereas p is determined by the arrival date

* **{\displaystyle DP\_{T}^{S}}**

arrival date = delivery date + transit time

By cumulating the results of singular cases over a certain period p and, if necessary, additional criteria c (e.g. customer, product, ...) the delivery performance is calculated as follows:

{\displaystyle DP\_{p,c}={\frac {\sum \_{p,c}(DP)}{count\_{p,c}(singularcases)}}}

whereas p is determined by the first confirmed date


## Result

0%≤{\displaystyle DP\_{T/D}^{S/V}}≤100%
