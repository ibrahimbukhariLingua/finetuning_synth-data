## History

The current company draws its origins from the Autonomous General Air Traffic Flight Assistance Company (AAAVTAG), established in 1981, following the demilitarization of air traffic control, which followed a sensational strike by air traffic controllers, currently all in force to the Air Force, which took place on October 19, 1979.

The AAAVTAG was a non-economic public body which in December 1996 was transformed into an economic public body, with the name of Ente Nazionale Assistenza alla Volo (ENAV).

To support the liberalization of air transport, the National Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC) was established in 1997, with the functions of Italian authority for technical regulation, certification and supervision in the civil aviation sector.

On 1 January 2001, ENAV was transformed into a joint stock company fully owned by the public (ENAV S.p.A.). The company is owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and is subject to the supervision of ENAC and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. The Court of Audit is responsible for checking the legitimacy of the company's financial management.

In April 2016, ENAV presented the application and documentation for listing to the Italian stock exchange and CONSOB. As of December 2022, the Ministry of Economy and Finance holds 53.28% of the share capital.
