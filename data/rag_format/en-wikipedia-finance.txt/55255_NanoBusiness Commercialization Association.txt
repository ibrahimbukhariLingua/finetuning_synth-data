# NanoBusiness Commercialization Association



The **Nanobusiness Commercialization Association (NanoBCA)** is a 501(c)(6) non-profit trade organization dedicated to creating a friendly political environment that nurtures research and innovation in nanotechnology, promotes tech-transfer of nanotechnologies from academia to industry, encourages private capital investments in nanotechnology companies, and helps its company members bringing nanotechnology products to the market. Founded in 2001, NanoBCA is the world's first non-profit association focused on the commercialization of nanotechnologies. Since its establishment, NanoBCA has been advocating for the continued allocation of significant funds per the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). NanoBCA dedicated work in shaping national nanotechnology policy has created a favorable policy climate for nanotechnology at every level, benefiting academic research, small businesses, and the manufacturing industry. NanoBCA has been advocating for Congress to ensure the continuous allocation of government funds to nanotechnology, such as basic research and SBIR grants, throughout all the major government agencies (DOD, DOE, NFS, NIH, etc.).

Based in Washington, D.C., and Shelton, Connecticut, the NanoBCA serves the entirety of the United States and its territories. Their vision is focused on ensuring that the United States is and remains a global leader in the field of nanotechnology. By monitoring newly passed and proposed legislation from the Federal and State governments, NanoBCA assures the safe, secure, and beneficial use of nanotechnology and nanoscience for all peoples.


## History

In November 2001, NanoBCA was founded by F. Mark Modzelewski, Nathan Tinker, Josh Wolfe, Vincent Caprio, and Griffith Kundahl â€“ with the intention of boosting the advancements of nanotechnology from basic research to commercial products.
Since 2001, the organization has been directed and managed by Mr. Vincent Caprio, who takes care of moderating productive discussion among its members, the Government, Congress, academia, and industry, as well as organizing the annual conferences and roundtables.
In March 2011, the organization changed its name from *NanoBusiness Alliance* to *NanoBusiness Commercialization Association* to display its dedication to the commercialization of nanotechnology products.
