## Diversification

In 2020, the company invested an estimated UGX:10 billion (US$2.73 million) in commercial honey farming in collaboration with local dairy farmers.

Local over-production, limited local consumption and difficulty in securing willing regional buyers are some of the challenges. The Pearl Dairies Honey Factory is currently under construction in Mbarara, 168 miles southwest of Kampala.

More than 10,000 dairy farmers in the south western Ugandan districts of Bushenyi, Kabale, Kiruhura, Lyantonde, Mbarara, Mubende, Ntungamo, Sheema and Rukungiri that are confronted with milk-related challenges will be introduced to honey to diversify their incomes.

As part of its diversification strategy, the company announced plans to enter new regional markets including, Ethiopia, Malawi, South Sudan and Zambia. The four leading export products for the company are (a) powdered milk (b) UHT milk (c) butter and (d) flavored milk.

In June 2021, the company unveiled a new milk-processing line capable of packaging 130,000 litres (28,596 imp gal; 34,342 US gal) daily. The line, which incorporates Sweden-based *Tetra Pak* technology, cost USh9.25 billion (approx. US$2.6 million) to install. The UHT milk packaged on this line has a shelf-life of up to 9 months if unopened. The company also announced its entry into Ethiopia, South Sudan and Malawi.


## Recent developments

In October 2021, the company exported, 50 tonnes of powdered milk, under their *Lato Milk* brand.
