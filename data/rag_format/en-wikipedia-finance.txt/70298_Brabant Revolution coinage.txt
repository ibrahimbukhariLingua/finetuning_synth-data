Brabant Revolution coinage


# Brabant Revolution coinage



The **coinage of the United Belgian States** was only produced during the state's one-year existence in 1790, following the Brabant Revolution, but provided a strong numismatic influence for the coinage of Belgium after its independence in 1830.


## Background

In 1789, Brabant Revolution took place in reaction to liberal reforms made by Joseph II and the Austrian rule in Belgium. After Austrian forces were defeated by the rebels at the Battle of Turnhout in 1789, Austrian forces withdrew from the country leaving the rebels in power. On 11 January 1790, with the signing of the Treaty of Union, the counties and dukedoms which had made up the Austrian Netherlands became one country: the United Belgian States.


## Coinage

The coinage was issued in eight denominations divided into Liards, Sols, and Florins. It was only produced during the short one-year lifespan of the country meaning that all examples are dated 1790. Legends are rendered in Latin. The ten Sols & Florin coins were given a new legend after it turned out that VNIONE also meant "onion" in the locally spoken languages.

The types minted were:

### Iconography

The iconography on the coinage stressed the unity of the state. On the 3 Florin, this was represented by the individual display of all the coats-of-arms of the 11 states which had merged; on the 10 sols, it was represented by 11 arrows behind a two shaking hands.
