Because optimization spans multiple technical fields, it can be labeled as mathematical optimization, advanced analytics, operations research or artificial intelligence.

Sashihara wrote that *The Optimization Edge: Reinventing Decision Making to Maximize All Your Company’s Assets*:

> uses non-technical language to explain to executives what optimization is, the opportunities and challenges it poses, and why it should be an important item on their agendas.

> Some industries have made extensive use of optimization software for specific business problems, such as supply chain optimization, transportation management, and price optimization for retailers. But Sashihara argues businesses have barely begun to tap the potential of the technology to be applied to any problem of limited resources — whether those resources are people, fuel, space on a shelf or in a truck, hours in the day, or dollars in the bank.
