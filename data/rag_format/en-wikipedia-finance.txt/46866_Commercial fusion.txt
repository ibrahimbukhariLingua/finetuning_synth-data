Commercial fusion


# Commercial fusion



**Commercial Fusion** is a term used to refer to privately owned companies whose aim is to sell electricity produced by nuclear fusion. The industry now consists of over 40 companies who have attracted a combined total of more than $6 billion in investment.

## First fusion electricity to the grid

For decades researchers have famously said that fusion power is always 30, or even 50, years away. The advent of commercial fusion has changed that, and now fusion power is typically predicted to be around 10 years away, with most companies predicting that the first fusion plant will deliver electricity to the grid before 2035. Although the majority of the companies have only existed for a few years, some have already failed to deliver on their predictions. General Fusion first predicted that it would deliver electricity to the grid by 2009.
