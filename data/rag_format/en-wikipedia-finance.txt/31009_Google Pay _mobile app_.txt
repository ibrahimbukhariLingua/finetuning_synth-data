On November 18, 2020, Google launched a companion app in the United States. It functions as an expansion of the Singaporean and Indian versions of the app. The company announced the Google Wallet companion app during the 2022 Google I/O keynote, which replaced the 2018 Google Pay app while co-existing with the 2020 one after it was launched on July 18, 2022.

On June 4, 2024, Google discontinued the app in the United States, replacing it with Google Wallet.


## Features


### QR & NFC payments

GPay supports QR payments via PayNow or FavePay in Singapore, and both QR & NFC payments via UPI or EMV in India.


### Online payments

GPay can be used to pay with UPI online for certain Indian merchants. The feature is **not** compatible with using Google Pay's similar online payments functionality, which instead uses tokenized EMV payment cards.


### P2P payments

The app supports P2P payments in both India and Singapore, using either UPI or PayNow.


### UPI Circle

At the Global Fintech Fest 2024, Google Pay announced that it will be introducing the UPI Circle feature. The second half of 2024 will see the release of this feature. With the help of this feature, users can assign payment duties to dependable friends or family members. For people who do not have direct access to financial services or who are afraid to use UPI for digital payments, UPI Circle is very helpful. Google Pay UPI user can add supplementary users to their account via UPI Circle. With UPI Circle, one can use platforms for collaboration or gig economies to create micro-communities where people can pool resources or settle payments in real time.


### UPI Vouchers

Google Pay also revealed at the Global Fintech Fest 2024 that it will be launching UPI Vouchers, a capability that was first made available for COVID-19 vaccine payments. This feature will be released in the second half of 2024. With UPI Vouchers, users can transfer prepaid vouchers that are connected to the smartphone number of the recipient. The recipient of these vouchers does not need to connect their bank account to UPI in order to use them for payments. It is now possible for businesses and individuals to issue and use UPI vouchers more easily thanks to the adaptation of this feature for a wider range of industries. In addition to making financial transactions for users easier, UPI Vouchers offer a smooth digital payment option for a variety of scenarios, including corporate gifts, government programs, and others.


### Clickpay QR

Clickpay QR was launched by Google Pay in collaboration with NPCI Bharat Billpay. With this functionality, customers can pay their bills by just using the Google Pay app to scan a Clickpay QR code. Users don't need to memorize account numbers or customer IDs because the QR code—which billers can generate—automatically retrieves the most recent bill details.


### Prepaid Utilities Payment

Prepaid utility payments are being added by Google Pay as part of its expansion into the recurring payment space. With Google Pay, users can now find and connect their prepaid utility accounts—such as those for power or housing society bills—directly. The purpose of this feature is to streamline the process of managing and monitoring recurring payments within the app. The addition of new utility providers to this group will assist users by providing a single platform for managing all of their recurring payment requirements.


### Tap & Pay

RuPay card users can now make payments even easier using Google Pay's Tap & Pay feature. With the use of this technology, customers may use Google Pay to link their RuPay cards and pay with just a tap of their phone at a card reader. The 16-digit card number is safeguarded during transactions thanks to the secure storage of the card details. RuPay cardholders now have even more convenience when making payments thanks to this feature, which eliminates the need for actual cards.


### Autopay for UPI Lite

Autopay for UPI Lite is being introduced by Google Pay. When a user's UPI Lite balance drops below a predetermined amount, this feature immediately tops it off for them. UPI Lite is a simplified version of UPI intended for small-ticket transactions. Users can keep making tiny payments with Autopay without having to worry about running out of money.


## Country availability
