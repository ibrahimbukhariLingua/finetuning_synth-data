## Early life and education

Ajay was born and raised in Delhi, India. His father Late Krishan Mohan Bijli was employed by the family's road freight business, Amritsar Transport Co., which was initially established by Ajay's grandfather in 1939. The family later moved to Delhi, where Ajay pursued his education at the Modern School. He completed his BCom from Hindu College of University of Delhi. After graduating, he joined his family's transportation business and his father's Priya Theater in Delhi. Bijli's father Krishan Mohan Bijli died in 1992 and in 1994 a big fire broke out in the warehouse of his transportation business. On the advice of his mother, Bijli wrote cheques to all of those whose goods were gutted in the fire. In 1995, a Hollywood producer introduced Bijli to an Australian production house "Village Roadshow" which expanded in India further and led to the start of PVR-Priya Village Roadshow.


## Career


### Initial years and the beginning of theatre business

During his childhood, Ajay frequently visited his father's office, located near his school. In 1978, when his father took the ownership of Priya Cinema, Ajay found himself getting inclined towards movies. At the age of 22, he joined his family's transportation business, despite lacking enthusiasm for it. Later, Ajay convinced his father to let him run Priya Cinema for six months. He took inspiration from Sterling Cinema in Mumbai, and renovated Priya Cinema, installed a Dolby Sound System, refurbished interiors, and started playing Hollywood movies. He targeted a niche audience and recovered his initial investment within a year. The Government of India then announced the decontrolling of movie ticket prices along with a reduction in entertainment tax, which helped in propelling Priya Cinema's profits.


### Foray into multiplexes

In 1995, Ajay met John Crawford, Asia managing director, Village Roadshow, an Australian media major which was keen to get into India at that time. They entered into a joint venture, which led to the inception of Priya Village Roadshow (PVR). In 1997, PVR set up India's first modern multiplex cinema at Saket (Delhi) after reconstructing the Anupam Cinema.


### Struggle and growth

Ajay continued to expand PVR in other parts of Delhi, and had 12 screens by the year 2000. After his Australian partner left Village Roadshow from Indian market, Bijli decided to expand his business, and negotiated deals worth Rs. 100 crores for nearly 50 screens across Hyderabad, Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai by 2001. The expansion deals were impacted by the September 11 attacks in the United States, leaving Ajay fending for his Rs. 100 crores deals on his own. He then secured a funding of Rs. 80 crores from ICICI Ventures in 2003.


### Breakthrough

In 2012, PVR acquired the Mumbai-based Cinemax and Ajay became its managing director. Ajay also acquired DLF's DT cinemas in the year 2016. In 2017, the American cinema player iPic Entertainment appointed Bijli on a board position, from which he resigned in July, 2018.


### Post pandemic

As the founding member of Multiplex Association of India, Ajay initiated and submitted enhanced safety and precautions plan for cinemas to Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India) and various other state governments. Ajay also ensured that business operations at PVR continued with responsibility and care towards its employees, customers and communities at large. PVR’s Covid-19 relief efforts became the brand’s first project ever that had no budget. Ajay-led PVR also organised free vaccination camp at PVR Juhu in Mumbai, for film workers and their dependants in partnership with Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital. In 2022, Ajay launched a music video with his band Random Order to pay a tribute to the medical community for their selfless work throughout the pandemic.


### Merger with INOX

In April 2023, following the merger of PVR Cinemas and INOX Leisure Limited, Ajay became the Managing Director (MD) of the merged entities, PVR INOX Ltd and PVR INOX Pictures Ltd.
