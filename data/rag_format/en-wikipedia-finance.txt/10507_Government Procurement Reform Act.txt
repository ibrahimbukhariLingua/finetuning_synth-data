## Criticisms


### Lack of preference on local suppliers over foreign suppliers

During the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) occurred worldwide, including in the Philippines. To close some of the supply gaps, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) asked garment and textile manufacturers to shift to the production of PPE. This call was answered by the Confederation of Philippine Manufacturers of PPE (CPMP). However, the government's procurement law, RA 9184, prevents domestic manufacturers from competing against foreign manufacturers that have the ability to bid at lower prices. Unfortunately, the law has no provisions for preference of domestic products over foreign products. According to Art. X Sec. 34, the government can only award the contract to the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid or Highest Rated Responsive Bid. This forced companies to incur loss, partially close the repurposed factories and lay off around 3,500 workers in December 2020.
