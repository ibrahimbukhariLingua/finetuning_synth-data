## World Trade Organisation Director General nomination

On July 8, 2020 it was announced that Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri will be the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's nominee for the role director general at the World Trade Organisation. The nomination came nearly a month after WTO released a 125-page report stating that Saudi Arabia breached international law, as it was distributing pirated content via its pay-per-view service, beoutQ.

On 17 August, 19 human rights organizations urged the member countries of WTO to reject Saudi Arabia’s nominee for the Director General’s post. The appeal stated that being a high-ranking official of Saudi government, Tuwaijri remained silent of the Kingdom’s repressive records and was complicit in the country’s human rights violations. On 7 October 2020, it was reported that Al-Tuwaijri failed to secure enough support to win the bid to become WTO’s Director General. He got out of the race in the second round, along with UK’s Liam Fox and Kenya’s Amina Chawahir Mohamed Jibril, leaving two women, Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s Yoo Myung-hee to proceed to the final round.
