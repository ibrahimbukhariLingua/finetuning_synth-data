**Medical Park Hospitals Group**, which has been active in the health care sector since 1995, offers service in various provinces of Turkey with more than 6,000 doctors and employees, 17 hospitals in total. Medical Park is the biggest hospital group in Turkey.

The hospital chain was founded by Muharrem Usta, who currently chairs the company. The company owned two hospitals in Istanbul in 2005. In 2006, he initially sold 30% of the company shares to Sancak family. This partnership enabled a rapid growth of the company that led to the establishment of 13 hospitals with 2,000 beds within three years. By the end of 2009, 40% of the company shares were sold to the third biggest US-American global asset management firm The Carlyle Group. With this new partnership, the number of hospitals reached 17 with 2,771 beds in total that placed the company on first rank of its kind in Turkey. In March 2013, it was reported that the Carlyle Group sold its shares at Medical Park to the largest US-American private equity investment firm Texas Pacific Group.
