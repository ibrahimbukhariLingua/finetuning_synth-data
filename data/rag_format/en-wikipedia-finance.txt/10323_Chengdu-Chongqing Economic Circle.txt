Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle


# Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle



The **Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle**, or **Chengdu-Chongqing**, **Chengyu**, **Chengyu Metropolitan Region** (Chinese: 成渝地区双城经济圈、成渝城市群、成渝经济区、成渝都市圈) is a Chinese national-level regional development strategy encompassing Chengdu, Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality in southwestern China. Designated by the State Council in 2021, it aims to transform the area into China's "fourth growth pole" alongside the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, and Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area clusters. Covering 185,000 km² with a population of 96 million, the initiative focuses on integrated infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and technological innovation.


## Economic Drivers

Key sectors include electronics (40% of China's laptop production), automotive (12% of national output), and biotechnology. Major projects include:

* Chengdu-Chongqing High-Speed Railway (1h travel time between city centers, operational since 2025).
* Western (Chongqing) Science City, a $15 billion hub for AI and quantum computing.
* Twin-City Free Trade Zone enabling cross-border e-commerce with ASEAN.

In 2023, the region's GDP reached $1.6 trillion, accounting for 6.8% of China's total.


## Challenges

Persistent disparities exist between urban cores and rural areas like Bazhong and Wanzhou, where per capita GDP remains 35% below Chengdu's average. Environmental concerns include air pollution (45% of days exceeding PM2.5 standards in 2022) and Yangtze River tributary contamination.


## Policy Innovations

A 2024 pilot program introduced cross-provincial GDP sharing for joint ventures and a unified carbon trading platform.
