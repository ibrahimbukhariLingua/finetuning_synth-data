# Edson Mitchell



**Edson Mitchell** (1953â€“2000) was an American investment banker and executive. He served as the head of Deutsche Bank's global markets organization. During his tenure, he transformed the bank into a major and highly profitable player in trading bonds, securities and foreign currencies. Mitchell was one of the first two Americans to be appointed to the nine-member management board of Deutsche Bank. He was a descendant of Swedish immigrants.


## Early life and education

Mitchell was born on May 19, 1953, in Portland, Maine and raised in South Portland and Auburn. He went to Edward Little High School and later graduated with a degree in Economics from Colby College in 1975. He did an MBA from Dartmouth's Ames Tuck School in 1978.


## Career

Mitchell started his career in the banking industry in 1978, starting at Bank of America in Chicago before moving to New York to join Merrill Lynch in 1980. In 1995, he was recruited by Deutsche Bank to head its global markets organization in London. Under his leadership, the bank's global trading activities became highly profitable.

In June 2000, Mitchell and his colleague, Michael Philipp, were appointed to Deutsche Bank's nine-member management board, making them the first two Americans to hold such positions. Mitchell was expected to take over as the head of Deutsche Bank's investment banking group in 2002, succeeding Josef Ackermann.

When Mitchell took over as chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, the bank implemented several bold measures in investment banking, including the integration with London's Morgan Grenfell bank, divestment of corporate holdings, acquisition of top financial talent from competing banks and the purchase of US Bankers Trust in 1999. These strategic moves proved to be effective, positioning the bank as a major player in the financial sector.
