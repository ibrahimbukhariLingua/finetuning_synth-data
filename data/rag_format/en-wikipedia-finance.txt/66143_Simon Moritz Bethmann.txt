## Life

**Simon Moritz** was born in Nassau, northwest of Frankfurt am Main, the youngest son of the identically named Nassovian administrator *Simon Moritz Bethmann* (1687–1725). Together he and his older brother Johann Philipp founded in 1748 what would become the Bethmann bank, based on the 1746 inheritance from their maternal uncle *Jakob Adami* in Frankfurt. In 1746, he and Johann Philipp purchased citizenship in Frankfurt for 800 guldens each. Their brother Johann Jakob carried on the family name in Bordeaux, where he became a merchant and shipowner.

In 1755 Simon Moritz became deacon of the *Niederländische Gemeinde Augsburgischer Confession* (= Dutch Congregation of the Augsburg Confession), a charitable institution transferred to Frankfurt in 1585 by Martinist Lutherans who had fled Antwerp's religious persecution. Together with Johann Philipp he purchased the *Basler Hof* property from the Patrizier *Johann Friedrich Maximilian von Stalburg*, where the Bethmann bank maintains offices to this day.

He was married to Elisabeth Rummel, daughter of the Leipzig notable Balthasar Rummel. Noted for his good works—including a bequest of 50,000 guldens to the Frankfurt Citizens' Hospital. He died without issue at Frankfurt am Main in 1782.
