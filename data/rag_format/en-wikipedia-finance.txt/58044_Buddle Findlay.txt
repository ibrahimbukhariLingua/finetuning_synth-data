# Buddle Findlay



**Buddle Findlay** is a commercial law firm that operates throughout New Zealand, with offices in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.


## History

The Wellington firm of Buller & Anderson (Arthur Percival Buller and John Anderson) was founded in 1895, and Findlay Dalziell & Co (John Findlay and Frederick George Dalziell) opened soon after in 1899. Buller & Anderson became Buddle Anderson Kent & Co (Thomas Buddle, John Anderson) following a series of mergers, while Findlay Dalziell & Co would eventually become Findlay Hoggard Richmond & Co. In 1982 the two firms merged to form Buddle Findlay. Four years later, the firm established an Auckland office through a merger with Malloy Moody & Greville, and a partial merger with Holmden Horrocks & Co. Through a merger with Christchurch firm Brookman Stock in 1989, the firm's Christchurch office was opened.
