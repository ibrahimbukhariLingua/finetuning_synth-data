# Mannheim Centre for Competition and Innovation



The **Mannheim Centre for Competition and Innovation** (**MaCCI**) in Mannheim, Germany is a research association of ZEW and the Faculty of Law and Economics at the University of Mannheim. The aim of MaCCI is to foster interdisciplinary research in the area of competition, regulation and innovation policy. MaCCI research contributes to fundamental problems in economics and law as they apply to competition, economics of innovation, and regulation. Core research topics include digital markets and platform economics, competitive effects of mergers and acquisitions, consumer search, public and private enforcement of competition law and innovation. About 70 researchers are members of MaCCI. Each year, MaCCI (co-)organizes a number of conferences and workshops for both young and experienced researchers to strengthen the exchange between researchers in the fields of law and economics. Detailed information on MaCCI activities and events can be found on the MaCCI website and the annual Activity Reports and MaCCI Letters, which contain three research highlights by MaCCI members each year.
