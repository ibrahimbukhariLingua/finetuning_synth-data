## Partnerships

On 2 September 2013, the local organising committee of the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was hosted by New Zealand and Australia, appointed a joint venture of Nine Live and Spotless Group to provide hospitality services for the tournament. The services include sales, marketing, and event management of the tournament’s hospitality program.


## Controversy

Spotless has a high-profile industrial relations test case in Australia after claims of bullying and harassment surrounding Spotless’ use of individual flexible agreements (IFAs) were raised by members of United Voice. United Voice is the union that represents contract cleaners employed by Spotless at shopping centres, CBD buildings and other privately and publicly owned buildings.

The case was heard by the Federal Court of Australia, where United Voice argues that Spotless is in breach of the Fair Work Act as it leaves cleaners worse off than they would be without the IFAs. United Voice also states that cleaners have reported that they have been unduly pressured into signing the agreements and were allegedly told that if they refused to sign the IFAs, they would be warned that their hours would be cut or that they would be refused overtime hours after the Cleaning Services Award. The Union says Spotless' use of IFAs in these circumstances is contrary to the intent of the individual flexibility provisions under the Fair Work Act and that Spotless is trying to re-introduce WorkChoices AWAs.

The case was due to go before Fair Work Australia on 18 April 2011; however, Spotless did not attend the voluntary mediation.


### Resolution

In April 2012, Spotless agreed to audit a representative group of cleaners’ employment records. The Fair Work Ombudsman agreed to Spotless’ decision to sign a Pro-Active Compliance Deed.
