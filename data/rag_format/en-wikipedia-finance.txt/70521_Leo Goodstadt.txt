**Leo Francis Goodstadt**, CBE, JP (Chinese: 顧汝德, 21 April 1938 - 24 April 2020) was a British economist based in Hong Kong. He served as the first head of Central Policy Unit, from 1989 to 1997.


## Life

Goodstadt studied economics at the University of Oxford and the University of Manchester, and arrived at Hong Kong in 1962 as a Commonwealth Scholar.

He had a long but intermittent career at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He was a lecturer in economics from 1964 to 1966; an honorary lecturer in law from 1979 to 1985; an honorary research fellow at its then Centre of Asian Studies (CAS) between 1977 and 1998, and again between 2005 and 2011; and an honorary institute fellow at the institution's Hong Kong Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences since 2011. In 2001, he was named an HKU Honorary University Fellow.

In 1989, Goodstadt was appointed by then-Governor Sir David Wilson as the head of the newly established Central Policy Unit. He kept serving in the role after Chris Patten succeeded Wilson in 1992, and retired following the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, after which he moved to Dublin and became an adjunct professor at Trinity Business School, Trinity College Dublin.

He was also known for his reporting on Hong Kong, when in 1966 he was the deputy editor of the now-defunct Far Eastern Economic Review for ten years, with coverage specially on Hong Kong and China. Goodstadt served as editorial director of Asiabanking between 1981 and 1986, as well as Hong Kong correspondent for Euromoney (1978-1988) and the Times (1967-1973). He has been a regular contributor to the BBC and previously hosted a weekly public affairs program on Asia Television, a local television station, for ten years.
