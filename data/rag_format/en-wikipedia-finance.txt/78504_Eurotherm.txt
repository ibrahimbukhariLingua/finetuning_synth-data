## History

The first Eurotherm company, Eurotherm Controls, was formed in 1965 at Worthing, West Sussex to manufacture temperature controllers. In 1970, the directors of the company set up a number of loosely related but independent companies to develop and produce other product lines. Chessell Ltd was created to manufacture data recorders, while Turnbull Control Systems (TCS) was formed to produce process control systems, and Shackleton System Drives (SSD) to produce variable speed electronic drives. All four companies marketed their offerings internationally, and in 1974 they were brought under an international holding company, Eurotherm International.

In 1978 the holding company went public and it became quoted on the London Stock Exchange in May of that year. By 1989, Eurotherm International controlled a network of subsidiaries and agents in the UK, USA, Switzerland, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Australia, Holland, Belgium, Scandinavia, Spain, Korea, India and Ireland. It was acquired by Siebe plc June 1998, later to become Invensys plc. Invensys was acquired by Schneider Electric in January 2014.

By the late 1990s, three key Eurotherm companies, Eurotherm Controls, Eurotherm Recorders (previously Chessell) and Eurotherm Process Automation (previously Turnbull Control Systems) amalgamated to form Eurotherm Limited.

In 2009 Eurotherm, along with the Invensys businesses Foxboro, IMServ Europe Ltd, Skelta, Triconex and Wonderware, formed Invensys Operations Management, a provider of automation and information technologies, systems, software, services and consulting on manufacturing and infrastructure.

In 2022, Watlow acquired Eurotherm from Schneider Electric, expanding the company’s presence in Europe and product offering in sophisticated thermal controls.
