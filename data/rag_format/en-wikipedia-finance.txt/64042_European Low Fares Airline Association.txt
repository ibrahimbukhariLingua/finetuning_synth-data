# European Low Fares Airline Association



The **European Low Fares Airline Association** (**ELFAA**) was an organization formed in 2004 to represent low-cost carriers and lobby European institutions on their behalf. It ceased operations and disbanded in 2016, as major members joined the newly formed trade group Airlines for Europe. ELFAA was based in Brussels, Belgium.


## Membership

Before stopping operations in 2016, ELFAA had ten members: British Airways and Iberia and low-cost carriers EasyJet, Jet2.com, Iberia Express, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizz Air.
