## Early life

Merrill was born on November 21, 1873 at Bangor, Maine where his father and grandfather were bankers. He was a son of Isaac Hobbs Merrill (1846–1901) and Ada Frances (née Godfrey) Merrill (1846–1923). Among his surviving siblings were Fullerton Merrill and Ralph Winslow Merrill.

His paternal grandparents were Elias Merrill, who served in the U.S. Civil War, and Emma Augusta (née Hobbs) Merrill (a daughter of Isaac Hobbs). His maternal grandparents were Edwin Dudley Godfrey and Harriet Sophia (née Rice) Godfrey.

After attending Philips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, he attended Harvard University, where he graduated *magna cum laude* in 1895.


## Career

After a year traveling around Europe, he joined his father's firm, Merrill & Co., in Bangor in 1896. Two years later he moved to New York City, briefly working with Kountze Brothers, before joining Estabrook & Co. with whom he was affiliated until 1901 when he returned to Maine to become managing partner of the family firm. In 1903, he organized the Merrill Trust Company and, in 1905, he became president of the Veazie National Bank when it merged with Merrill Trust.

Returning to New York City in 1909, he joined Central Trust Company as a vice president before joining the Union Trust Company as president in 1910. When the two companies merged in 1918, he became vice president and vice chairman of the Central Union Trust Company. In 1920, he became president of the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company. In 1922 when it was consolidated into the Bank of New York, he was made president of the resulting Bank of New York and Trust Company. In 1931, he was elected chairman of the company and was succeeded as president by John C. Traphagen.
