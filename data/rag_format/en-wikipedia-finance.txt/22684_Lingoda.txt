# Lingoda



**Lingoda GmbH**, operating as **Lingoda**, is a subscription-based e-learning platform that teaches languages in live classes via video conferencing. It teaches English, German, French, and Spanish, in addition to business English.


## History

Lingoda was founded in Berlin, Germany in 2012 by brothers Fabian and Felix Wunderlich under the name Easy Languages. Its headquarters are in the Mitte district of Berlin.

In 2013, Easy Languages was rebranded as Lingoda, and the company expanded its operations to offer English lessons, as well as classes for small groups. In 2016, Lingoda started teaching French and Spanish courses.

In 2018, LinkedIn listed Lingoda as one of Germany’s 25 most sought-after startups.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a substantial boost in business for Lingoda. The company reportedly increased its customer numbers by 200 percent in a one-year period from 2020 to 2021.

Since 2020 Lingoda has been offering international health professionals (nurses, midwives, doctors and, since 2023, OTA) preparation for professional recognition in the form of digital courses.

In 2021, Lingoda received an investment of 57 million euros from U.S. based private equity firm Summit Partners; it has reportedly drawn a total of about 70 million euros in investment between its founding and 2021. This funding has led Lingoda to be described as a potential “unicorn startup”, referring to technology companies valued at over US$1 billion. In the same year, Lingoda was named the Hottest EdTech Startup at the Europas Awards. It also won the 2021 EdTech Cool Tool Award for Best Language Learning Solution, and was named Overall Language Learning Company of the Year at the EdTech Breakthrough Awards.

In 2021, Lingoda also launched the initiative Match Pflege to support international health professionals in professional recognition, qualification and integration, offering online language classes.

In summer 2022, Lingoda launched the Match Talent initiative in cooperation with Kiron Open Higher Education to counteract the shortage of skilled workers in Germany. The initiative supports international talents in their qualification and integration into the labour market and German society. Match Talent combines educational programmes offered by partners in Germany with language, integration and career coaching.


## Overview

Lingoda's business model is similar to traditional language schools but adapted for an online setting. All classes are conducted live through videoconferencing software like Zoom.


## Reception

PC Magazine gave Lingoda a positive review, praising the in-person instruction and the affordability, although it criticized the company for the limited number of languages it offers.
