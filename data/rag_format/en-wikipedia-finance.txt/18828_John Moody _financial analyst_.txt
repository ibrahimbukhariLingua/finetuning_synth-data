John Moody (financial analyst)


# John Moody (financial analyst)



**John Moody** (May 2, 1868 – February 16, 1958) was an American financial analyst, businessman and investor. He pioneered the rating of bonds and founded Moody's Investors Service. Moody's ratings are still issued, carrying on the tradition begun by *Moody's Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities* and continued by the annual *Moody's Analyses of Investments*.

He resided in Cranford, New Jersey from 1893 to 1913.


## Moody and bond rating

Moody's was later merged into Dun & Bradstreet, only to again become an independent corporation in October 2000. Moody's status is reflected in Thomas Friedman's 1996 comment: that

> *There are two superpowers in the world today in my opinion. There's the United States and there's Moody's Bond Rating Service. The United States can destroy you by dropping bombs, and Moody's can destroy you by downgrading your bonds. And believe me, it's not clear sometimes who's more powerful.* (February 13, 1996 interview with Jim Lehrer)

In 2007, Moody's Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody's Analytics, with all of its other services.
