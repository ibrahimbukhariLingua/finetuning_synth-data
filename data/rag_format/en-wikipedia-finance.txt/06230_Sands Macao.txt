**Sands Macao** (Chinese: 金沙娛樂場) is a hotel and casino resort located in Sé, Macau, SAR - China. It is owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, and was designed by Steelman Partners, LLP. It comprises a 229,000 square feet (21,300 m²) casino, and a 289-suite hotel.

Las Vegas Sands chairman Sheldon Adelson has said that his company will soon be a mainly Chinese enterprise, and that Las Vegas should be called "America's Macau". The president and chief operating officer of Las Vegas Sands Corporation predicted on February 12, 2007 that Macau's gaming revenue has topped that of the Las Vegas Strip and will more than double again by 2010.
