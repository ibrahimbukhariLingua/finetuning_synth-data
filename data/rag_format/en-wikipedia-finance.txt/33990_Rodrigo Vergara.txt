His first steps in the world of work were taken in 1985, recently graduated, when he worked as a researcher at the Central Bank of Chile. He worked at the entity until 1987, the year in which he received a scholarship from the issuing entity to pursue his postgraduate studies.

Back in his country, he rejoined the Central Bank as head of the area of financial macroeconomics (1991), a position he held until September 1992, when he was appointed chief economist of the agency, then headed by Roberto Zahler.

Vergara, together with the former managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagard, in December 2009, was part of the team of advisers to Sebastián Piñera, the center-right presidential candidate.
