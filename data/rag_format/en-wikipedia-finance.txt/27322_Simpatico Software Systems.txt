## Election investigation

In 2020, Block was hired by the Donald Trump campaign to investigate claims of fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The *Washington Post* reported that Simpatico was paid around $750,000 to conduct the investigation.

After investigating, Simpatico found no evidence of electoral fraud. According to Block, the theories advanced by the Trump campaign were "all false".

In 2023, Simpatico was the subject of a subpoena brought by Jack Smith, a special counsel appointed as part of an investigation by the federal government into multiple claims against Trump. Block has stated that he has spoken to investigators.
