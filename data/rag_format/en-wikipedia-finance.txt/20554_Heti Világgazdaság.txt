## History and profile

The magazine was important in the years spanning the transition from communism in airing new ideas and challenging boundaries. During the same period, it was also a leading investigative publication. HVG Publishing Co. was founded in 1989. In 2003, Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) acquired 75% of the magazine. In 2014 WAZ (Funke) redeemed its majority stake, which was bought back by former HVG shareholder, management and editorial staff, and HVG was again in Hungarian hands.


## HVG cover pages

*HVG'*s cover pages always work on one of the main themes of the week, mostly depicting ironic humor. In the 80's, headlines were mostly not photos, but graphics featuring suggestive hints. These covers intended to affect the sense of humor of readers sensitive to the criticism of the ruling political system. After the change of regime, cover pages became partly more concrete, and partly continued the earlier tradition.
