## History

In 1892, 77 cooperative members founded the *Gütersloh Spar- und Leihbank e.G.m.b.H* with 14,110 Mark start-up capital, to whose founders and supervisory board members the mayor and later honorary citizen of Gütersloh, Emil Mangelsdorf, belonged. Ten years later, in 1902, the bank counted 414 and 1912 already 967 cooperative members. 1910 it was renamed to *Gütersloher Bank eGmbH*, from 1942 the bank operated under the name *Volksbank Gütersloh eGmbH*.

In 1886, the *Gütersloh Spar- und Darlehenskassenverein eGmbH* was founded. In 1933, the bank merged with the *Kattenstrother Spar- und Darlehenskassenverein*, founded in 1899, to become the *Gütersloher Spar- und Darlehenskasse eGmbH*, which was converted into an eG in 1963. In 1988, the *Gütersloher und the Spar- und Darlehenskasse Avenwedde*, which was founded in 1886, merged.

Finally, in 1990, these two "original strands" of the bank, *Gütersloh Spar- und Darlehenskasse eG* and *Volksbank Gütersloh eGmbH*, merged to form *Volksbank Gütersloh eG*.

In 2004, the new headquarters of the *Volksbank*, planned by the Frankfurt office Turkali Architekten, was built on a plot of almost 6,000 m² opposite the Gütersloh main railway station. Two years later the Volksbank Foundation was founded, which promotes voluntary work by citizens in the business area of Volksbank Bielefeld-Gütersloh eG.

In April 2011, the bank and *Stadtwerke Gütersloh* founded the energy cooperative *GrünEnergie eG*, which finances projects for ecological energy generation.
