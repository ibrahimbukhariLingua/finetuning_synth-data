Center for Distributive, Labor and Social Studies


# Center for Distributive, Labor and Social Studies



The **Center for Distributive, Labor and Social Studies** (CEDLAS) is a research center specialising in distribution, labor and social issues in Latin America.


## Agenda

The Center was formally created in 2002 within the UNLP’s Economics Department. It specialises in policy and applied empirical research on distributive and labor issues based on microdata from household surveys in Latin America and the Caribbean. The work carried out by its researchers covers also a wider range of issues and geographic areas, as witnessed by the Center’s collection of working papers and the research projects carried out since 2002 for a host of international organizations, national governments and research institutions.

Since its inception, the Center has been responsible for the development and maintenance of the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC), a joint project with the World Bank. Social and distributive indicators from SEDLAC are used by the World Bank’s World Development Indicators and feature in the United Nations’ WIDER World Income Inequality Database.
