## Company history

First Security Bank was chartered in 1932 in Searcy, Arkansas, under the name of Security Bank. In 1966, the name was officially changed to First Security Bank. The bank was originally located at the corner of Arch Street and Spring Street but in 1971 moved to its current location at 314 N. Spring Street, on the corner of Spring Street and Race Street.

In 1977, Reynie Rutledge purchased First Security Bank and in 1981 created a bank-holding company that is now known as First Security Bancorp. Through the years, First Security Bancorp has acquired and established several financial organizations to create Arkansas’ sixth largest bank-holding company.

In 2004, First Security opened its first branch in Little Rock on Cantrell Road. Soon after, construction was completed on the First Security Center in the Little Rock Rivermarket District. The building is the tallest in the Rivermarket area and houses a First Security branch, a six-story Marriott Courtyard Hotel, and several floors of office space and luxury condominiums.

First Security has over $4 billion in assets and over 900 employees working in 72 locations throughout the state in 2014.
