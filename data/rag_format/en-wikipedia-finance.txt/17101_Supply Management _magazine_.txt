## History

The first issue of the magazine was published on 14 March 1996 and incorporated *Purchasing and Supply Management* and *Procurement Weekly*. *Purchasing and Supply Management* was itself preceded by *The Purchasing Journal* which ran between the 1950s and 1970s.

In March 2011 the magazine switched from a fortnightly to a monthly publication. The November 2013 edition was the first to be sent also to CIPS members in Australasia.

In January 2016, *Supply Management* was re-launched under the ownership of Haymarket Media Group.
