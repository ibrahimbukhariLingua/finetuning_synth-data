Accumulation function


# Accumulation function



In actuarial mathematics, the **accumulation function** *a*(*t*) is a function of time *t* expressing the ratio of the value at time *t* (future value) and the initial investment (present value). It is used in interest theory.

Thus *a*(0) = 1 and the value at time *t* is given by:

where the initial investment is {\displaystyle A(0).}

For various interest-accumulation protocols, the accumulation function is as follows (with *i* denoting the interest rate and *d* denoting the discount rate):

* simple interest: {\displaystyle a(t)=1+t\cdot i}
* compound interest: {\displaystyle a(t)=(1+i)^{t}}
* simple discount: {\displaystyle a(t)=1+{\frac {td}{1-d}}}
* compound discount: {\displaystyle a(t)=(1-d)^{-t}}

In the case of a positive rate of return, as in the case of interest, the accumulation function is an increasing function.


## Variable rate of return

The logarithmic or continuously compounded return, sometimes called force of interest, is a function of time defined as follows:

which is the rate of change with time of the natural logarithm of the accumulation function.

Conversely:

reducing to

for constant {\displaystyle \delta }.

The effective annual percentage rate at any time is:
