# Churchill Living



**Churchill Living Limited** is a British property and domestic construction company. It specialises in accommodation for old people, and has more than 200 retirement properties.

The company is privately owned and family run, and operates from six regional offices. In 2020 it was named as the 3rd Best Company to work for in the UK in the *Sunday Times* top 100 list.

For the 12 months to 30 June 2022, the company reported revenue of £200.1m and pre-tax profit of £34.6m.

In 2023 the company received the maximum 5 star rating for customer satisfaction from an independent survey by the Home Builders Federation (HBF).

The Company has previously been subject to criticism from The Times in an article titled **“Inheritances slashed as value of retirement homes plunges”** in an article relating to the poor and significantly lower resale values achieved on the properties they build and manage. This was matched by an article in the Express titled **“Families feel 'ripped off' by major developer as retirement home prices plunge**”

In the same year, Leasehold Knowledge Partnership also reported **“Three quarters of Churchill Retirement flats have lost money when resold”**

In September 2023, Housing Minister Rachel Maclean publicly called out Churchill Living for issuing a slew of new leases with ground rent in an attempt to circumnavigate the ground rent ban in April 2023. Maclean stated Churchill Retirement Living had issued a slew of new leases – 400, according to the minister – just before the new ground rent ban applied to retirement housing on 1 April 2023 that included ground rents which, in some cases exceeded £600.

“Churchill had issued leases on incomplete developments, so they could continue to charge ground rent on new properties after the 1 April [2023] cut-off date,” said Rachel Maclean.

“The Secretary of State Michael Gove himself wrote to Churchill to express his concerns. And in response to that, they decided to do the right thing, I am pleased to say, and remove ground rent terms from all developments launched after 1 April this year, irrespective of whether leases have been granted or not. And that is very good news for nearly 400 potential customers.”


## History

Spencer and Clinton McCarthy established Emlor Homes Limited in 2002; for about three months in 2003 it was known as Churchill Retirement Living Limited. In 2007 a company named Avenue Shelfco 35 Limited was renamed to Churchill Retirement Living, and then to Churchill Retirement Living Limited. In 2024 the company changed its name to Churchill Living Limited.

In 2010 John Sidney McCarthy was appointed director of another company, Churchill Retirement plc (company number 07428858).

In 2016 the company received the *WhatHouse?* "Housebuilder of the Year" award.

In early 2024, the Advertising Standards Authority condemned Churchill Living after it published misleading energy saving claims in an advert fronted by Esther Rantzen. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the adverts must not appear again in their current form and that: “Savings claims must be supported by robust evidence and appropriately qualified. In addition, ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility and should not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason.”

In 2024, South Oxfordshire District Council fined Churchill Living £2700 after it failed to remove multiple unauthorised advertisement in a conservation area.


## Careline Support Ltd.

In 2020, the company launched a new Careline Support business to provide direct 24/7 emergency call service to over 6,000 apartment owners at its retirement developments across the country.
