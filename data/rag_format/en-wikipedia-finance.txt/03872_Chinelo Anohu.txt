But it also means I'm really good at being a homemaker. My mother excelled, excels, both in the home and outside of it. She bakes, cooks and everything. Till today she still makes my father's food and she loves to do it. I was raised in an environment where it was not a big deal to take care of your own home. As a child I would be hiding reading a book and my father would seek me out and tell me, you must learn how to cook, wash clothes and keep house because you have not shown me any indication that you can afford house help.'"
