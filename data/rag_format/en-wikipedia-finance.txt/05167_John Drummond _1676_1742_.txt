## Career in the Netherlands

Drummond was the third son of George Drummond of Blair Drummond, Perthshire, and his wife Elizabeth Ramsay, daughter of Sir Gilbert Ramsay, 1st Baronet, from Bamff in Perthshire. In 1691 he was sent to Amsterdam with a letter to Andrew Henderson, who specialised in finding places for Scottish boys in Dutch business houses. There he met and befriended James Brydges (later Duke of Chandos), who assisted his career thereafter. After the Peace of Ryswick in 1697, he set up in partnership with a Dutchman, Jan van der Heiden and, for a time, their business in fine goods, coffee, tea, chocolate and wine prospered. By 1709, Drummond had married Agatha Vanderbent of the Netherlands, sister of the Elector of Brandenburgh's agent at Amsterdam With the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, he extended his business to supplying cash to the British Army in the Low Countries and stock-market intelligence to Brydges. He withdrew £5,000 from the business with a view to buying a seat in the British Parliament at a time when the partnership was already over-borrowed and in May 1712 van der Heiden and Drummond defaulted on 100,000 guilders in debts.
