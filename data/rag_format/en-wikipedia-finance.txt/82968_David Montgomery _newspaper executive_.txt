# David Montgomery (newspaper executive)



**David Montgomery** (born November 6, 1948) is a media executive, proprietor and media investor. He has also edited two tabloid newspapers during the course of his career.


## Early life and career

Montgomery was born in Penrith, New South Wales, Australia, and attended Bangor Grammar School and Queen's University in Belfast, where he studied history and politics and edited the student magazine *The Gown*.

In 1973 he joined the staff on the *Daily Mirror*, one of the UK's large-circulation tabloids. He became chief sub-editor in 1978. two years later he moved over to the rival publication, *The Sun*.


## Newspaper editor

Montgomery was later editor of *News of the World* from 1985 to 1987. He then became director of News (UK) Limited, a subsidiary of News International owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Between 1987 and 1991, Montgomery was editor of the *Today* newspaper, by then owned by Murdoch.

Between 1992 and 1999 he served as chief executive of Mirror Group plc—publishers of the *Daily Mirror* and other national titles and a range of regional titles—following the death of its previous owner Robert Maxwell in 1991. During his tenure as Mirror Group CEO Montgomery oversaw a number of changes, including taking a stake in *The Independent* and its sister-paper *The Independent on Sunday*. At the time, he was nicknamed "Rommel" by staff because "Montgomery was on our side".

Early in 1999 Montgomery stepped down from the Mirror Group CEO role after some well-publicised running disagreements with the boardroom and the non-executive chairman Sir Victor Blank, and after a period for the company described by some commentators as "crisis-hit".


## Later career

In 2000 Montgomery founded Mecom Group, a London-based investment company that would specialise in mergers and acquisitions of newspaper and media companies in continental Europe. Mecom embarked on a series of European magazine and newspaper acquisition deals, including the 2005 purchase of Berliner Verlag, publisher of *Berliner Zeitung* and *Berliner Kurier*. The acquisition was made in partnership with the American private equity firm and media broker Veronis Suhler Stevenson, part-financed with credit loans. Montgomery and his equity partners thereby became the first foreign owners of a German publishing group. The sale generated a degree of controversy among some German media observers, with a number of journalists and staff at Berliner Verlag's titles protesting against the sale and voicing concerns over the direction the new shareholders would take the publications.

In 2012, Montgomery formed Local World Limited, and acquired a number of regional papers which were later sold to Trinity Mirror (now known as Reach plc), with Montgomery going on to form a new company called National World.

In 2020, Montgomery's National World company bought JPIMedia, publisher of *The Scotsman* and *The Yorkshire Post*, in a £10m deal which also included many other local newspapers.

In 2021, Montgomery (as chairman of Local Television Limited) launched a rival to channel 7 Freeview service That's TV in Manchester on channel 99 and outlined plans for a new 'Northern TV Network' which would include Local TV's channels in Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle.
