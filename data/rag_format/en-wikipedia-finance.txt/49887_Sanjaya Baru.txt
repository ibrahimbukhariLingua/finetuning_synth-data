## *The Accidental Prime Minister*

In April 2014, Penguin India published *The Accidental Prime Minister*, Baru's tell-all memoir about his time at the Prime Minister's Office. In it, Baru alleges that the prime minister was completely subservient to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who wielded significant influence in the running of the Singh administration, including the PMO itself. The book sparked off a controversy, with the office officially denouncing it as "fiction". Baru has said that he set out to show an empathetic portrait of the prime minister.
