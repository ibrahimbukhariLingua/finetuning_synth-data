## History


### Predecessor companies

Mavenir has a complex corporate history as a result of successive acquisitions and spin-offs. The main historical predecessors are:

* Xura, which was composed of pieces of Comverse, Inc., Acision, and a number of other acquired companies. Comverse, Inc derived from Comverse Technology, was active in traditional value-added services (VAS), digital cloud services, Unified Communications (VoIP & UC), and a suite of evolved communication services. Acision was a privately held secure mobile messaging and engagement services firm. These entities were combined in 2015 to form Xura, which focused on two core product areas: digital communications services and converged communications (traditional and IP).

* An older entity with a similar name, Mavenir Systems, initially a company focused on transition from 3G to 4G with IMS products and solutions, founded in 2006. It acquired Airwide Solutions, Stoke and Ulticom and In 2013, the company went public on NYSE with MVNR ticker symbol. The company was acquired by Mitel Networks Corporation in 2015 to create Mitel Mobility.

* Ranzure Networks, a startup focused on developing 5G cloud-based radio access network technology.

How it came together:

In mid-2016, Xura was acquired by affiliates of Siris Capital Group in a deal that valued the company at approximately $643 million. On 19 December 2016, affiliates of Xura agreed to acquire Mitel Mobility, for $385 million, and Ranzure Networks Inc., for an undisclosed sum.


### The New Mavenir

When the transactions completed on February 8, 2017, the newly merged company was renamed Mavenir Systems Inc., trading under the Mavenir brand.

Mavenir has continued to acquire technology - including its acquisitions of Aquto, a cloud-based sponsored data platform (2018); Argyle Data (2018), a machine learning security platform; Brocade’s vEPC, and ip.access (2020), a specialist small cell vendor.

On 6 October 2020, Mavenir announced that it had filed a registration statement for an initial public offering (IPO) of ordinary shares on Nasdaq. Due to market volatility in the run-up to the 2020 US elections the company postponed the IPO on 28 October but stated that it would keep market conditions under review in the following months.
