In 2007, Sanford paid $4.5 million as part of a settlement with the New York Attorney General that alleged deceptive practices in marketing.

### Legal issues

In 2020, it was reported that Sanford was being investigated for possession of child pornography. Investigators obtained a search warrant before referring the case to the United States Department of Justice. The investigation has led several institutions to reconsider his philanthropy. The investigation was ongoing as of January 2022 at both the state and federal levels; that May, the office of the South Dakota Attorney General announced it had ended the investigation without filing charges. Records unsealed in April 2023 at the request of *ProPublica* revealed that an AOL email account that investigators linked to Sanford contained photos of nude girls estimated to be between 8 and 15 years old, but that it was established that others had access to the account, including indications that it had been hacked.

In 2010 Sanford committed to The Giving Pledge to give away much of his fortune. In May 2023, after the unsealing of the aforementioned records, he was removed from the Giving Pledge's list. He can no longer participate in its events.
