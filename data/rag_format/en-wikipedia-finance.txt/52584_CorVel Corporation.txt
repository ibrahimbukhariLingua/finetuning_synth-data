## History

In 1987, Gordon Clemons joined with Jim Michael and Jeffrey Michael, investors from Minnesota, and founded CorVel Corporation (originally named FORTIS). Three small vocational rehabilitation firms were consolidated to form the initial foundation of the new Company, valued at approximately $2 million with over 200 associates.

Within two years, the Company expanded to 51 American locations, and they entered the medical bill review and medical case management business.

In 1991, the Company first issued stock to the public and began trading on the NASDAQ at a market capitalization value of $46 million. The offering raised $3.5 million, net of the repayment of venture funding. The following year, the Fortis name was sold, raising $4 million and the Company changed its name to CorVel Corporation. With the funding from the name sale, CorVel began building a national preferred provider organization (PPO).

During the mid '90s, CorVel doubled its office network again, and expanded its software offerings. PPO services became an important part of most healthcare management sales. Out of network medical review was added to the portfolio of provider programs.

By 2005, CorVel grew to over 2,000 clients and 15% compounded annual stock growth.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
