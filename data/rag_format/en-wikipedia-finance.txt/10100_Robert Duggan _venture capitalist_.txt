# Robert Duggan (venture capitalist)



**Robert W. Duggan** (born 1944) is an American billionaire entrepreneur, biotech and health care executive. He is the former CEO of biopharmaceutical company Pharmacyclics and was previously CEO of surgical systems maker Computer Motion from 1997 to 2003. Duggan is the majority shareholder and a director of Pulse Biosciences and Summit Therapeutics, where he is also CEO.


## Early life

Robert Duggan was born in Oakland, California, in 1944; the third of five children. His father was an Irish immigrant who became an industrial engineer in the U.S; his mother was a nurse. According to Robert Duggan in Investopedia, “We [our family] made about $800 a month…The last couple days of every month we scrambled around the house looking for lost quarters, dimes, and nickels [to pay the bills]."

Duggan attended St. Francis High School in Mountain View, California, where he was both the captain and quarterback of the school football team. He is recorded as saying “I captained my football team, I'd get in a huddle, and I'd go: ‘Guys – sacrifice your body. We're behind in this game. We are not losing this game. Get out there. Sacrifice your body. Win the game guys. There's nothing more important in life right now than winning this game.'"

After graduating cum laude from St. Francis High School, he attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of California, Los Angeles, majoring in business and economics. At UCSB he met Herbert C. Kay, a Wharton fellow and acclaimed Stanford graduate who became his mentor.

Duggan's first business venture was mowing lawns as a teenager in California. He said this about the lawn mowing enterprise to Entrepreneur.com, "as a teenager, my first business was mowing lawns. My goal as a teenager was not to make the Forbes 400 list but to simply make enough money to get myself through college. When I was mowing lawns I realized when I went that extra mile to make a difference for the better, the property owner wanted to tip me or give me more work. It wasn't even very difficult. Sometimes it was a simple smile, extra care to make sure a hedge was edged perfectly, or taking the time when I was done to have the owner walk the property with me admiring my work."

Duggan's first company, Sunset Designs, supplied Jiffy Stitchery kits to consumers - helping them create their own high-quality stitched projects at home. He invested $100k in Sunset Designs, and sold it to British consumer-goods giant Reckitt Benckiser Group for $15 million in the mid-1980s. More than 7,000 retail locations sold Jiffy Stitchery kits, giving the company an 80% market share.


### Paradise Bakery

### Computer Motion (Intuitive Surgical)

Duggan was a founding shareholder of Computer Motion (now Intuitive Surgical), which develops the technology used in robot-assisted surgery, aimed at improving patients' experiences by reducing the degree of invasion during surgery. The company worked to accomplish "patient and physician-friendly" robotic surgery - a term coined by Duggan who led the company as chairman from 1990 to 2003. On 7 Sept 2001 Computer Motion conducted the "Lindbergh Operation" - the first transatlantic telesurgical operation. It was performed by surgeons in New York on a patient in France.


### Pharmacyclics

Pharmacyclics is a pharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of cancer therapies. From 2008 to 2015, Duggan was the largest investor in as well as chairman and CEO of Pharmacyclics. The company then focused its research on ibrutinib (branded as Imbruvica), a B cell cancer drug highly effective for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common form of adult leukemia. Imbruvica was approved for the treatment of four different types of blood cancer.

Duggan invested in Pharmacyclics when it was valued at between $1 and $3 per share, and negotiated its sale to AbbVie at $261.25 per share in 2015, in a deal valued at $21 billion. He received $3.5 billion from the sale of Pharmacyclics to AbbVie in "one of the biggest paydays ever from the buyout of a publicly held company." As CEO and chairman of Pharmacyclics from 2008 to 2015, Duggan had opted not to receive compensation from the company.

Investopedia says, between 2008 and 2015, "Duggan saved Pharmacyclics and turned it into a billion‐dollar company with more than 500 employees."
