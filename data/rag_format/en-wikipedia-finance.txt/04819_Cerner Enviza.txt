## History


### Founding

Kantar Health was established in 2009 when Kantar Group restructured, following the acquisition of TNS in 2008. It is one of four dedicated vertical sector operating units. It combined the TNS Healthcare, Ziment Group, Consumer Health Sciences, and MattsonJack Group businesses to create a healthcare research, insight, and consulting specialist to sit alongside Kantar Media, Kantar Retail, and Kantar Worldpanel.


### Acquisitions

HCI (ACNielsen HCI), a research organization focused on healthcare promotions, moved to Kantar Health in 2010 after its acquisition by WPP in 2008.

In 2014 Kantar Health acquired Evidências (Focus Assistência Médica S/S Ltda. and Classe Assistência Médica S/S Ltda.), a healthcare research company based in Brazil. Evidências specializes in “Evidence-based, health management services” and operates in all segments of the Brazilian healthcare market, including health insurance, government bodies, hospitals and providers, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. It was one of three Brazilian agencies acquired by WPP in as many weeks.

In 2015 Kantar Health acquired CEEOR, a research and consulting company in the Czech Republic. CEEOR specializes in analytical services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries, largely focusing on developing late-phase research, such as Phase IV therapeutic use studies.
