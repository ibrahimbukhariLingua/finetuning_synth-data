## Products and services


### Cord Blood Banking

Cord blood banking refers to the collection at birth, processing, testing, cryopreservation and storage of stem cells from the umbilical cord blood. Cord blood, also called "placental blood", is blood that remains in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of a baby and after the umbilical cord is cut. During pregnancy, the umbilical cord functions as a lifeline between mother and child. After a baby's delivery, the cord blood present in the umbilical cord could offer hope for the child or members of the family. Cord blood is a rich source of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are primarily responsible for replenishing blood and regenerating the immune system.

Cordlife's cord blood banking services are available in the following countries: Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Vietnam.


### Cord Lining Banking

Cord lining banking refers to the collection, processing, testing, cryopreservation and storage of the lining from an umbilical cord. After the baby is delivered, the umbilical cord is cut and normally discarded with the placenta as medical waste until researchers became aware of its medical potential.

Cord lining contains both Epithelial (EpSCs) and Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). EpSCs form the soft tissues that connect, support, or surround other structures and organs of the body including cornea, skin, and liver. MSCs are the building blocks of structural tissues of our body such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fibrous tissues and fat.

Cordlife's cord lining banking services are available in the following countries: Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Vietnam.


### Non-invasive Newborn Metabolic Screening

Newborn metabolic screening screens for inborn errors of metabolism from urine samples that can impact the health of newborns. Metabolic disorders are usually not apparent at the time of birth. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the baby can suffer from neurological impairment and physical deformities.

Cordlife has already launched this newborn metabolic screening test (Metascreen) in the following countries: Hong Kong (through HealthBaby and Cordlife Hong Kong), Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.


### Non-invasive Prenatal Testing

Non-invasive prenatal testing ("NIPT") is a relatively new and highly accurate prenatal screening test that analyses foetal DNA in the mother's blood for potential foetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome. The test can be performed as early as 10th week of gestation through a simple and safe blood draw. NIPT has an accuracy rate of over 99%, much higher than conventional maternal marker-based prenatal tests. Through strategic partnerships with their third-party service providers, Cordlife is offering this services in Singapore, India, Indonesia and the Philippines.


### Newborn Genetic Screening
