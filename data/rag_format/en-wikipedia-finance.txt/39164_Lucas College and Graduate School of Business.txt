# Lucas College and Graduate School of Business



The **Lucas College and Graduate School of Business** is one of San Jose State University's schools and colleges. Lucas College is the largest Business school in Silicon Valley with firms in the area employing more of its graduates than from any other university in the United States. 80% of graduates are employed in the Valley. In 2010, the school appeared in Forbes' ranking of the top 20 "Colleges that will make you rich".


## History

The college was founded as the **Department of Commerce** in 1928, with the mission statement of "[making] this department one which will attract not only those who especially desire business proficiency as a vocational objective but also teachers who have been notably lacking in clerical accuracy and are thereby handicapped when confronted with blanks and schedules for official data". The department was organized by four teachers, led by Elmer H. Staffelbach, and only two areas of study were offered, secretarial training and accountancy.

By 1950, the Department of Commerce had grown to a staff of 40 that supported 7 majors and had a student body of 1,528, nearly a fifth of the entire student body.

The school became accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business in 1967.

In 2006, the school was renamed in honor of Donald Lucas and his wife Sally Lucas. Donald graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing in 1957. Sally graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Education degree in 1959. Donald created the Lucas Dealership Group and the Lucas Trust Ventures, which focused in the business of automobiles and real estate, respectively. Both companies have several locations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The college was named after the couple for their generous donation, history of philanthropy, and successful careers in Business and Education.
