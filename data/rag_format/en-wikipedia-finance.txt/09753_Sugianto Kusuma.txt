## Land reclamation controversy

In mid-2015, North Jakarta officials refused permission for developers to proceed with the construction of offshore islands. However, despite this denial, some developers continued their work. Concurrently, Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama proposed a draft Regional Regulation (Perda) on land reclamation to the DPRD. This legislation aimed to clarify spatial planning rules, facilitating developers in obtaining necessary permits. However, it also proposed an increase in the percentage of tax from land sales. This adjustment, from the previously set level of five percent by President Soeharto to 15 percent. Kusuma estimated an additional cost of Rp12 trillion due to this change.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2015, according to investigations by the Corruption Eradication Commission, DPRD members convened at the residence of Sugianto Kusuma. Allegedly, during this meeting, Kusuma influenced senior provincial legislators to pass the spatial planning legislation without the provision for increased land contribution. Some witnesses, as reported by the press, claimed that developers offered sums ranging from Rp2.5-5 billion to each DPRD member who cast the appropriate vote. Kusuma and his son, Richard Halim, have undergone questioning by the KPK multiple times, and were put on an international travel ban in April 2016, which was eventually lifted in October 2016.

According to Tempo, Agung Sedayu made four payments to Prasetyo Edi Marsudi, the speaker from PDI-Perjuangan and a former employee of Kusuma, who then distributed the funds to others, including Ongen Sangaji. A wire-tapped conversation presented in court by KPK prosecutors revealed an Agung Sedayu executive informing Sanusi that Kusuma would exert pressure on Marsudi to ensure the passage of the Perda on spatial planning. Sanusi, in turn, expressed dissatisfaction with Marsudi's distribution of bribe money, claiming it hindered cooperation among DPRD members.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2016, Gerindra legislator and speaker of the local parliament, Mohamad Sanusi, received a sentence of 7 years and a fine 250 million Rupiah. The head of Agung Podomoro Land, Ariesman Widjaja, received a three-year prison sentence for having paid a Rp. 2 billion bribe to the Mohamad Sanusi. His assistant, Trinanda Prihantoro, received a sentence of 20 months who confirmed Sanusi's purchase of multiple assets from Agung Podomoro Land, including apartments and buildings. Additionally, investigators seized evidence from Sanusi, including luxury vehicles and cash, suspecting that he received inducements from developers and distributed payments to other DPRD members.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
