## History

The creation of Pakistan State Oil (PSO) can be traced back to the year 1974, when on 1 January; the government took over and merged National Oil (PNO) and Dawood Petroleum Limited (DPL) as Premiere Oil Company Limited (POCL).

Soon after that, on 3 June 1974, Petroleum Storage Development Corporation (PSDC) came into existence. PSDC was then renamed as State Oil Company Limited (SOCL) on 23 August 1976. Following that, the Esso undertakings were purchased on 15 September 1976 and control was vested in SOCL. The end of that year (30 December 1976) saw the merger of the Premier Oil Company Limited and State Oil Company Limited, giving way to Pakistan state Oil (PSO). A year later, it was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange.

After PSO's inception, the corporate culture underwent a comprehensive renewal program which was fully implemented in 2004. This program over the years included the revamping of the organizational architecture, rationalization of staff, employee empowerment and transparency in decision making through cross functional teams. This new corporate renewal program has divided the company's major operations into independent activities supported by legal, financial, informative and other services. In order to reinforce and monitor this structural change, related check and balances have been established by incorporating monitoring and control systems. Due to this effective implementation of corporate reform and consistent application of the best industrial practices and business development strategies, PSO has been able to maintain its market leadership in a highly competitive business environment. Pakistan State Oil delivers kerosene, light diesel oil and lubricants to consumers through over 500 distributors all over Pakistan.
