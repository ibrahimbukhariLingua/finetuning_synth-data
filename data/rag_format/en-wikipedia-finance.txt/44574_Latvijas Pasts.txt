# Latvijas Pasts



VAS **Latvijas Pasts** (English: Latvian Post) is the main state-owned postal service provider in Latvia headquartered in Riga. It was founded on 2 January 1992, following shortly after the restoration of independence of the country.


## History

Latvia Post was founded on 2 January 1992 as a state-owned company, prior to which multiple postal companies had already existed in the territory. On 1 November 2004, Latvia Post was re-registered simply as a state joint-stock company instead of having the status of a nonprofit organization state stock company.

In 2014, Latvia Post partook in the transition from lats to euro that took place in the whole country by providing currency exchange services following the official exchange rate of 1.00 LVL for 1.42 EUR for 3 months in 302 post offices where it was deemed necessary due to local banking service availability issues.
