# Fnbox



**Fnbox Ventures, Inc.** is a Latin American technology company primarily organized as a holding company that manages various online businesses.


## History of Fnbox

Fnbox was founded in June 2002 and raised $6 million investment from venture capital and private investors in 2008. Fnbox has built a series of businesses focused on the Latin American Internet community.


### 2002

Fnbox was founded in 2002 when CEO & Founder, Rodrigo Teijeiro turned to internet technology to save money on calls to Argentina. Rodrigo started Fnbox and his first subsidiary, TarjetasTelefonicas.com (known as Cloncom.com in the US market), with a development team located in Ukraine. According to Rodrigo, five days after going live the website was selling $500 worth of VoIP minutes.


### 2004

However, they soon realized that this service was highly exposed to Internet fraud and decided to close down the website and focus on developing a fraud protection system. After two years, with a fraud protection system ready to go, TarjetasTelefonicas.com was re-launched.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### 2006

In 2006, with a team of developers in place and Facebook spreading like wildfire among college campuses in the US, Fnbox decided to launch a social network customized for Latin American audiences. As an early mover in the Latin American social space, Sonico registered 4.4 million users in its first year. Fnbox immediately raised $4.3 million in financing from venture capital and angel investors and brought Sonico to Brazil, the largest consumer market in Latin America.


### 2010

By the end of 2010 Fnbox had 75 million users across Tarjetas, Sonico and Recarga, a prepaid phone recharge platform launched that year. It was time to focus on monetizing this traffic. In 2011 Fnbox bought a coupon site to offer daily deals to new and existing customers and launched an online advertising service to help businesses reach targeted audiences.


### 2012

Moving forward, Fnbox expects to leverage traffic and regional e-commerce know-how to attract Latin America's 355 million mobile phone users, 115 million registered social network users, and $30 billion of expected online shopping for 2013.
