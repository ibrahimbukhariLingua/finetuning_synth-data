## Career

## Work

Van der Heyden's early work was in the field of operations management. His more recent contributions cover business models, corporate governance, and organizational Fair Process. His 1999 HBR article, co-authored with Henry Mintzberg, presented a new visual tool, the organigraph, that allowed managers to identify potential opportunities for improving a firm's business. In 2008, in a paper with Christoph Loch and Yaozhong Wu, he developed a model to explain why Fair Process principles may not be applied in firms even when there is agreement that they lead to improved decision-making and execution.

In a 2009 article with Bert Spector and Jose Santos, Van der Heyden proposed a comprehensive model for understanding business model innovation, identifying four separate but interrelated components: a set of elemental activities; a set of organizational units that perform the activities (some internal to the firm, others external); a set of linkages between the activities, made explicit by transactions between organizational units and human relationships among the individuals who supervise and/or manage the linked organizational units; and a set of governance mechanisms for controlling the organizational units and the linkages between units. The paper further argues that interlinked business units are more likely to innovate business models than freestanding business units if the corporation is able to create a favorable context.
