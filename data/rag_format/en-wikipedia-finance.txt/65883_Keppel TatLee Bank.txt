## History

The bank was formed on 26 December 1998 when Keppel Bank acquired another Singapore financial institution, Tat Lee Bank. Keppel Bank was formed in 1990, when Keppel Corporation acquired the Asia Commercial Bank.

The bank formed a strategic alliance with Allied Irish Banks in 1999, which allowed AIB to take up a 24.9% stake in the bank.
