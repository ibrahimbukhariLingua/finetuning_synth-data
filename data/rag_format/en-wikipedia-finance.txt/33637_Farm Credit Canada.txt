Farm Credit Canada


# Farm Credit Canada



**Farm Credit Canada** (**FCC**, French: *Financement agricole Canada*; known as **Farm Credit Corporation** until 2001) is a Canadian Crown corporation and agricultural term lender.

This organization's purpose is to enhance rural Canada by providing specialized and personalized financial services to farming operations, including family farms. Although once exclusively a farm lender, FCC is now also organized to provide funding to enterprises that are closely related or dependent on farming. Its small and medium business focus is shown by its average loan disbursement of $163,649 (As of March 2014ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ).


## History and governance

FCC was established in 1959, under the *Farm Credit Act*, at that time solely to provide loans to farmers. It succeeded the Canadian Farm Loan Board, which had been in operation since 1929.

On April 2, 1993, Parliament passed the *Farm Credit Corporation Act* which then allowed the organization to expand beyond straightforward farm loans – to finance on-farm diversification projects and value-added agricultural operations beyond the "farm gate". In June 2001, the Farm Credit Canada Act changed FCC's name to Farm Credit Canada or Financement agricole Canada (FAC) in French.

In October 2008, Farm Credit Canada was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc, and was featured in *Maclean's newsmagazine*. Later that month, Farm Credit Canada was named one of Saskatchewan's Top Employers, which was announced by the Saskatoon *StarPhoenix* and *Regina Leader-Post* newspapers.

In December 2008, Farm Credit Canada was named one of *Report on Business Magazine'*s Top 50 Employers in Canada featured in *The Globe and Mail* newspaper.
