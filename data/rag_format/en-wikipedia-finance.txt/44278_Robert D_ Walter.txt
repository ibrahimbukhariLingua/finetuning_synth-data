## Early life

Walter graduated from St. Charles Preparatory School in Columbus, Ohio, and received a B.A. degree from Ohio University in 1967. Walter later attended Harvard Business School, where he received an MBA.


## Career

In 1971, he founded Cardinal Foods after purchasing Monarch Foods, a small Ohio food wholesaler. In less than a decade his company became a regional food distributor.

By 1983, the company went public and, under Walter's direction, achieved $1 billion in revenue in 1991.

In subsequent years, the company experienced extraordinary growth, "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight." Cardinal Health is now a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals, health & beauty products, and hospital supplies in the United States. In 2007, he was #14 on *Fortune* magazine's list of the 25 top-paid male executives, with total compensation of $42.7 million the previous year. He retired from Cardinal Health at the end of the 2008 fiscal year.

In 2016, after serving on the board since 2006, he was named non-executive chairman of Louisville based Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Walter previously served as a director of American Express, Nordstrom, CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse.
