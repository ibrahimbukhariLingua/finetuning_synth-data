Gerald Loeb Award


# Gerald Loeb Award



The **Gerald Loeb Awards**, also referred to as the **Gerald Loeb Awards for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism**, is a recognition of excellence in journalism, especially in the fields of business, finance and the economy. The award was established in 1957 by Gerald Loeb, a founding partner of E.F. Hutton & Co. Loeb's intention in creating the award was to encourage reporters to inform and protect private investors as well as the general public in the areas of business, finance and the economy.


## Gerald Loeb

Loeb first became known for his book *The Battle for Investment Survival*, which was popular during the Great Depression and is still considered a classic. Born in 1899, Loeb began his investing career in 1921 in the bond department of a brokerage firm in San Francisco, California. He moved to New York in 1921 after joining with E. F. Hutton & Co., and became vice-chairman of the board when the company incorporated in 1962. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 greatly affected Loeb's investing style, and in his 1971 book *The Battle for Stock Market Profits*, he viewed the market as a battlefield. Loeb offered a contrarian investing viewpoint, in books and columns in *Barron's*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *Investor Magazine*. *Forbes* magazine called Loeb "the most quoted man on Wall Street." He created the Gerald Loeb Award in order to foster further quality reporting for individual investors.


## The awards

The awards have been administered by the UCLA Anderson School of Management since 1973, and is sponsored by the G. and R. Loeb Foundation. It is regarded as: "business journalism's highest honor," and its "most prestigious." Beginning with just two winners in 1958 (Werner Renberg and David Steinberg) and expanding to three in the final years before the Anderson School began to administer the award, today there are ten categories in which prizes are awarded: large newspaper, medium newspaper, small newspaper, magazine, commentary, deadline or beat writing, wire services, and television. Those honored receive a cash prize of US$2,000, and are presented with the award at a ceremony in July of the year following their piece's publication. The preliminary judging committee includes business, financial and economic journalists, as well as faculty members from the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Once the finalists are selected, a final panel of judges consisting of representatives from major print and broadcast outlets selects a winner from each category. The final panel of judges is chaired by the dean of the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Entries are judged according to their originality, news value, writing quality, thoroughness and balance, and production value.

In 2017, Reena Ninan spoke onstage for UCLA's 60th Annual Gerald Loeb Awards for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism. This was held at Capitale in New York City.
