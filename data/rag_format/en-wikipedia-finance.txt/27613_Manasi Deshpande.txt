## Research

Deshpande's research focuses on the effects of social assistance schemes on labor markets. She has pursued research on disability insurance, Supplemental Security Income, and Social Security in the United States.


### Disability insurance

Deshpande's dissertation research focused on the effects of disability insurance on labor markets. In a paper in the American Economic Review, she shows that children removed from Supplemental Security Income have low incomes and little earnings growth into adulthood, suggesting that disability insurance has minimal effect on work incentives. For her work, she received the PhD Dissertation Award from the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.

Deshpande has also pursued research on the effects of application costs on the take-up of welfare benefits. In work with Yue Li in the American Economic Journal Economic Policy, Deshpande shows that closings of field offices by the Social Security Administration decreased the number of disability insurance beneficiaries in nearby areas, with effects especially strong for those with low education and earnings. For their work, Deshpande and Li were awarded the prize for best paper published in the American Economic Journal Economic Policy by the American Economic Association.


### Welfare and crime

In work with Michael Mueller-Smith in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, Deshpande leverages an age cutoff in review requirements for Supplemental Security Income benefits to show that removal from the program leads to a 20% increase in crime over twenty years, with effects driven by income-generating offenses such as theft, prostitution, and fraud.
