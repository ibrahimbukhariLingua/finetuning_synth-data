Meanwhile, in 1982, entrepreneurs Ronald Schreiber, Irwin Schreiber, Gerald Lippes and Paul Willax were busy founding Software Distribution Services in Buffalo, N.Y. Ingram Distribution Group, a unit of the privately held Ingram Industries, acquired Software Distribution Services in the spring of 1985 and renamed it Ingram Software. The operation was renamed Ingram Computer in February 1988.

After acquiring the remaining publicly traded shares of Micro D in 1989, Ingram Industries merged these two former competitors to create the microcomputer industry's first $1 billion computer products wholesale distribution company, renaming it Ingram Micro D.

In August 1993, Ingram Micro Belgium acquired Zaventem Electronic Dealer Distribution (Zedd) and much of its assets, including the right to distribute Hewlett-Packard products.
