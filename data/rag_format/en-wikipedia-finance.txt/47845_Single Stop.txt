Single Stop


# Single Stop



**Single Stop** is a nonprofit organization that fosters economic mobility and financial stability in the U.S. by connecting people through a coordinated "one-stop shop" platform that links individuals to a comprehensive array of federal, state, and local benefits and resources.


## History

Founded by Elisabeth Mason as a national nonprofit in 2007, Single Stop grew out of a New York City-based initiative of the Robin Hood Foundation to reduce poverty and build economic security for individuals and families by increasing their access to public benefits and financial, legal, and tax services.

In January 2016, Christy Reeves succeeded Elisabeth Mason as CEO of Single Stop.

In November 2021, Martin Hanna became the president and CEO of Single Stop.


## Approach

Single Stop provides its services within organizations who serve a population of Americans, such as food pantries, schools, and health centers. Staff is trained to screen individuals for the benefits and services for which they may be eligible as well as provide assistance in accessing those resources.

Single Stop's initiatives focus on creating financial stability for such specific low-income populations as community college students and veterans. On campus, Single Stop assists community colleges in retaining students through completion, thus reducing dropout rates and increasing students’ future income. Single Stop also helps the Office of Veterans Affairs transition veterans back to civilian life and reduce the number of veterans living in poverty.

According to the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Single Stop “has grown fast, and it’s poised to grow still more. Its goal, according to Mason, is to serve more than 1 million households annually by 2018. By expanding its reach into community colleges, veterans’ facilities, and other venues, Single Stop aims to equip more and more clients with the skills, services, and benefits that they need to gain a shot at sustainable economic security.”

Single Stop was cited by Fast Company as one of “The World’s Top 10 Most Innovative Companies of 2015 in Social Good” for making government benefits less daunting.


## Technology

Single Stop is an online screening tool that can quickly link students to federal, state, and local aid, with questions about household size, income, and location.


### Benefit Screener

Upon completing the benefit screener, clients are immediately given an estimate of how much aid they’re eligible to receive for programs like the Affordable Connectivity Program.


### Community Resources

The platform streamlines the process of connecting clients with services, addressing fundamental needs such as food access, education, healthcare, financial assistance, housing security, and tax preparation. Users can directly contact recommended benefit providers through the application.


## Impact and Efficacy

Single Stop's services have been shown to positively impact student retention, academic performance, and persistence rates in external studies conducted by Metis Associates and The RAND Corporation. These studies provide evidence that Single Stop helps educational institutions improve student success, particularly among subgroups such as students of color, low-income students, and first-generation college students.
