The academy is home to the historically famous Lloyd's Box symbolic of a Syndicate at old Lloyd's of London.


### History of Lloyd's Box

Lloyd's Box is essentially a set of historical Lloyd's Tables. The Lloyd's Box at National Insurance Academy was Michael Payne's box syndicate number 386. Michael Payne was a specialist non-US liability underwriter at Lloyds. It was installed in the old Lloyds; it was unique as it was the only non-square underwriting desk in Lloyds.

While adorning 1952 Lloyd's building it was acquired in 1970, and the esteemed box became a feature of the underwriting room at Lloyds Gallery level in the early 1970s. When Lloyds moved to their new building in approximately 1987, it was purchased by Robert Porter, the then managing director of E W Payne, and installed in E W Payne's boardroom at 8 Bridge Street Sydney.

Significantly, Rob Porter had brokered many pieces of Australian Liability business at that desk in the late 1970s and early 1980s; when it was relocated to Bridge Street, the insurance mighty and powerful enjoyed many good lunches at it in the EW Payne board room.

"When removed from the 1952 Lloyds building, the removal was overseen by the head waiter at the time who was delighted to know that it would continue service in Australia."

Rob Porter purchased the table by means of an offset brokerage deal between the QBE - E W Payne & Syndicate 386. The nominal value placed on it was AUD 25,000.

In 2006, this historical Lloyd's Box was presented to the then Director of National Insurance Academy (Dr K C Mishra) as Guru Dakshina (a teacher's dues) by the then Principal Officer of Marsh (Mr Sanjay Kedia), who is now its country head and MD. It was originally housed in National Insurance Academy Museum at Greenleaf Dome, named after the former AT&T Chairman, who popularized the concept of "Servant Leadership". Later on this monumental table was shifted to a special room named after Mr B K Shah, one of the three legendary Indians, who ever entered into Insurance Hall of Fame at Ohio, United States. The other two being Sir Joseph Arnould and Mr G S Diwan in whose names also NIA has dedicated academic spaces like a lounge and Alumnia room respectively.
