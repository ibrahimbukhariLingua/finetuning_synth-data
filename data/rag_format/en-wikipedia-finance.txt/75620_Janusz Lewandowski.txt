## Political positions

Lewandowski has expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, putting him at odds with many of his colleagues in the Barroso Commission. MEPs have asked "which steps" president Barroso will take over the comments. As one of the key experts on the European Union long term budget, known as "Multiannual Financial Framework", or MFF, MEP Lewandowski was one of the European Parliament "rapporteurs", recommending the agreement on the MFF 2021–2027.
