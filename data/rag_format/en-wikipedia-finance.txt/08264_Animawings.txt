In March 2020, it was announced Aegean Airlines had taken a 25% stake in the airline. The major part of the airline (75%) is owned by the Memento Group, a tour operator. In July 2020, the airline secured its Air Operating Certificate (OAC) and launched operations operating charter flights. In January 2021, the airline began selling tickets on its own website from 11 airports in Romania to destinations in Africa, Europe and Middle East.

In October 2021, Aegean Airlines increased its stake to 51%.

In February 2024, after 8 months of negotiations, the Romanian Competition Council approved Memento Group's purchase of the shares back from Aegean, now owning 100% of the airline.
