**Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc.** (三井住友トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社, *Mitsui Sumitomo Torasuto Hōrudingusu Kabushiki Gaisha*), formerly Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., is a Japanese financial holding company headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It provides an assortment of financial products to retail and wholesale customers, with a focus on asset management, financial brokerage, and real estate services.

Its main operating company is **Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Ltd** (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, *Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha*), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.

The company has no direct capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

There is just a weak control relationship between Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. In fact SM Trust Holdings controls about 66% of Japan Trustee Services Bank. As of March 31, 2017, SM Financial Group's website reports that Japan Trustee Services Bank owned 5.50% of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, but also 1.52% from trust location n. 1 (信託口1), 1.50% from trust location n. 2 (信託口2), 2.05% from location n. 5 (信託口5), 1.36% from trust location n. 7 (信託口7), and 1.85% from trust location n. 9 (信託口9) as well.
