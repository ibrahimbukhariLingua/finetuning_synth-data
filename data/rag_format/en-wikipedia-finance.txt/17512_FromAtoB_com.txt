# FromAtoB.com



**fromAtoB.com** was an intermodal journey planner and online booking platform for European travel, accessible via a web browser or mobile apps for Android and iOS. All relevant means of transportation such as train, airplane, bus, and carpool could be compared and combined within one trip. The company was founded in 2008, and was based in Berlin with an office in Aachen. Service ended on December 31, 2020 due to loss of revenue because of the COVID-19 pandemic, while AllRail, a trade association, attributes it to lack of real time data provided by European state railways.


## Data coverage

fromAtoB's travel metasearch engine was available in 15 countries and in 11 languages. The search engine was able to access information from more than 700 providers including Deutsche Bahn, Flixbus, Swiss Federal Railways, ÖBB, Renfe Operadora, Trenitalia, Eurowings, SNCF, Carpooling.com, and National Express Coaches. Tickets for Deutsche Bahn, Trenitalia, Eurowings and SBB could be booked directly through fromAtoB. If a user decided on a different provider, fromAtoB redirected to the provider's page and allowed the user to finish the booking there. Approximately 2.5 million users visited the site per month in 2013.
