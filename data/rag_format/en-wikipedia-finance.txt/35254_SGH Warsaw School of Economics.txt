SGH Warsaw School of Economics


# SGH Warsaw School of Economics



**SGH Warsaw School of Economics** (Polish: *Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie*, *SGH*) is the oldest and most prestigious business school in Poland.

SGH Warsaw School of Economics was founded in 1906 as a private school named *August Zieliński Private Trade Courses for Men*. On 30 July 1919, it became a separate legal entity and was granted the status of an institution of higher education. The school was renamed *Szkoła Główna Handlowa (SGH)* in 1933. After World War II, SGH was nationalized and its name changed to *Szkoła Główna Planowania i Statystyki (Main School of Planning and Statistics)*, abbreviation SGPiS. The school regained its pre-war name after the fall of communism in 1991.

SGH Warsaw School of Economics offers courses leading to bachelor's or master's degrees to both full-time and extramural students. It also provides programs for doctoral and postgraduate degrees. Its Finance and Accounting program was ranked among the Top 60 Masters in Management by the *Financial Times* in 2018.

SGH Warsaw School of Economics cooperates with around 200 higher education institutions worldwide within student and staff exchange areas. It is a member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), the Erasmus Programme, the Partnership in International Management Network (PIM), and the European University Association (EUA).

The main campus is located at the northern edge of the Mokotów district of Warsaw. Bus and tram stops, as well as the Pole Mokotowskie metro station, are nearby.


## Organizational structure

SGH Warsaw School of Economics abandoned the traditional departmental structure segregating students based on their major.

Professors and research and teaching programs are grouped in five Colleges (Collegiums) and several extra-collegial units, such as the foreign language teaching center.


## Courses offered

Full-time and part-time studies are conducted in two levels. Bachelor studies, which last for six semesters, lead to a Bachelor's professional title. Holders of such a title may apply for a place and begin Master's studies, which last for four semesters. Accumulating the required minimum points, as well as credit terms, is necessary to earn a diploma. Individual subjects are divided into mandatory selections for particular fields, optional for those subjects, additional courses that develop knowledge unrelated to specific subjects, and courses essential for all economists. Certain subjects can have different numbers of points for each of these types of items.

SGH full-time students are offered the following fields of study in Polish:

* Economics,
* European Master in Law and Economics,
* European Studies,
* Finance and Accounting,
* Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems,
* Management (Business Administration),
* Public Sector Economics (Public Administration),
* Social Policy,
* Spatial Economic Policy,
* International Economics,
* Big Data.

From the 2006/2007 Academic Year SGH Studies are divided into:

* Bachelor's Studies (undergraduate) – 6-semester
* Master's Studies (graduate) – 4-semester
* Doctoral Studies – 6-semester
* System based on ECTS credits

During the first three semesters, all SGH students study basic macro- and micro-economics, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, social science, law, history, geography, and languages. After passing the required examinations for the first three semesters, they must register for one of the six offered areas of study. The BA degree is granted after completing a required number of credits (about six semesters of studies), and the MA (MSc) degree is awarded after completing about eight to ten semesters (including six semesters for the BA), which is the maximum period of tuition-free study at SGH. Students do not necessarily have a BA diploma before applying for a master's degree. The time required for the degree in the given specialization depends mostly on the students themselves due to the free choice of courses (some limitations apply), professors, and the maximum workload per semester.


## International cooperation

SGH cooperates with over 250 foreign universities, as well as with many international organizations. The main partners are universities from the European Union, North America, and Asia. Each year, the international exchange involves about 500 SGH students, and the university hosts over 300 students from foreign institutes. Significant international cooperation programs include LLP Erasmus, CEMS (The Global Alliance in Management Education), Polish-German Academic Forum at SGH, Partnership in International Management (PIM), as well as double diploma programs (i.e. with Technische Universität Berlin), and other bilateral agreements.


## Student organizations

The Student Union, an elective body representing all SGH students in the School's Senate and participating in setting all study regulations, provides students with housing and financial aid as well as organizes a wide range of cultural events.
