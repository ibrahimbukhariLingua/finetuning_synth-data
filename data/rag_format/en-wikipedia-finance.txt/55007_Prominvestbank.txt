**Prominvestbank** (full name: Joint Stock Commercial Industrial & Investment Bank) was a bank based in Kyiv, Ukraine, formed in August 1992 from the Ukrainian operations of the Industrial and Construction Bank of the USSR.

## History

The history of the bank went back to the early 1920s, with the establishment of the soviet Prombank in 1922 and the opening on 1 January 1923 of its All-Ukrainian Office in Kharkiv. In 1936-1937, the All-Ukrainian Office of Prombank was relocated to Kyiv. During the reconstruction period that followed World War II, the bank participated actively in restoring various key industrial enterprises, including the reconstruction of Dnipro Hydroelectric Power Station, development of the Donbass coal-mines and other projects of national importance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1959, Prombank was merged into the Construction Bank of the USSR, or Stroybank. As a result, in addition to financing industrial, transport and communication enterprises, the bank started lending to the education and housing sectors. During this period, Stroybank was responsible for financing approx. 70% of all capital investments in the Ukrainian economy. In 1987, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted a resolution under which Stroybank was reorganized into the Industrial and Construction Bank of the USSR, known as Promstroybank in Russian and Prombudbank in Ukrainian.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The independence of Ukraine opened a new chapter of the Bank’s development. On 26 August 1992, Prombudbank was re-organised as a joint-stock company named the Industrial and Investment Bank, in shorthand Prominvestbank of Ukraine.¹⁶ On June 27, 2001, the name of the bank was changed to Joint Stock Commercial Industrial & Investment Bank (Prominvestbank).

In October 2008, due to a sharp outflow of clients' funds, the bank's liquidity significantly decreased. A decision of the National Bank of Ukraine dated October 7, 2008, introduced a temporary administration in the bank.
