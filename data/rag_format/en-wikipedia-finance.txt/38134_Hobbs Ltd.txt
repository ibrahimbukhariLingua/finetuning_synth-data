## Origins and history

Hobbs was established in Hampstead in 1981 by Yoram and Marilyn Anselm, targeting the "average woman between the ages of 20 and 40 interested in clothing". The brand was named after Marilyn's favourite brand of horsebox. Having studied sculpture at the Central School of Art and Design, Marilyn states that she began designing her own clothes because she was appalled by the lack of quality clothing available in the early 1970s. Hobbs initially produced shoes, but the clothing line was introduced in 1986, with continued growth of the shoe collection. UK expansion continued, to 34 stores across the UK in 2002. As of January 2020, Hobbs manages 77 stores across the United Kingdom and abroad and operates from a range of department stores, such as Debenhams and John Lewis.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Hobbs online store was launched in 2008, enabling customers to make purchases from the website. This was expanded to include international customers in 2013 and Hobbs now delivers to 55 countries, with websites serving Australia, Germany and the US.

In 2013 it was rumoured that the company would be sold, after it employed consultants from Price Waterhouse Coopers and began planning a launch of the brand in China. Its owners, 3i, wrote down the value of the company in January 2014. In the financial year 2014-15, Hobbs suffered pre-tax losses of £15.6 million, after acquiring a new chairman and chief executive during 2014. It closed nine outlets during the period. Hobbs is led by CEO Meg Lustman.
