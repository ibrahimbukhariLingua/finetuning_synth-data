**Bloomberg Radio** is a radio service of Bloomberg L.P. that provides global business news programming 24 hours a day. The format is general and financial news, offering local, national and international news reports along with financial market updates and interviews with corporate executives, economists and industry analysts. On off hours, local stations may preempt with local sports play-by-play coverage such as college basketball, tennis and other sports coverage.

Bloomberg Radio is broadcast on radio stations around the United States, and directly operates four radio stations:

* WBBR (1130 AM) in New York City.
* WBOS (92.9 FM) in Brookline–Boston and WNBP (1450 AM) in Newburyport.
* WDCH-FM (99.1) in Bowie, Maryland, serving Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.

In 1992, Bloomberg purchased the first of these, WBBR (1130 AM) in New York (at the time using the call sign WNEW), for $13.5 million. Bloomberg took over the operation of WXKS (1200 AM) in Newton, Massachusetts (serving Boston), on March 1, 2013. The following year, Bloomberg began programming KNEW (960 AM) in Oakland, California (serving the San Francisco Bay Area), on September 29, 2014. Both stations were owned and operated by iHeartMedia, but were programmed by Bloomberg Radio under a local marketing agreement (LMA). On December 21, 2015, Bloomberg Radio launched a similar arrangement on CBS Radio-owned WNEW-FM (99.1), its first FM radio station. The call letters of WNEW-FM were later changed to WDCH-FM and the station is now owned by Audacy, Inc..

On July 4, 2017, Bloomberg moved its programming in Boston to WRCA (1330 AM), owned by Beasley Broadcast Group. Later that year, it fully acquired WNBP (1450 AM) in Newburyport to serve as a simulcast of WRCA. Both WRCA and WNBP operate translator stations on 106.1 FM. Bloomberg's LMA with WXKS expired on March 1, 2018. On September 3, 2024, Bloomberg Radio moved in Boston from WRCA to another Beasley-owned station, WBOS (92.9 FM); that station's HD2 channel had already simulcast Bloomberg programming from WRCA. The LMA with KNEW expired on September 30, 2024, and was not renewed.

Bloomberg Radio is also heard nationally on Sirius XM satellite radio channel 119. Select programming is also broadcast in London UK on DAB digital radio via the London 3 multiplex (VHF block 11B), with simulcasts of the Bloomberg TV audio at other times.


## Programming

The original Bloomberg Radio news format divided each hour of the day into three 20-minute segments, each of which contained stock market updates, business headlines, traffic, weather, local news/sports, a human interest piece or a general update about cultural happenings. However, by 2010, Bloomberg Radio had shifted from a headline service to a discussion-based format in order to offer more in-depth market and economic analysis. Bloomberg Radio is the world's only global business radio service. *Bloomberg Daybreak Asia* broadcasts live from New York and Hong Kong, Sunday through Thursday 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. ET (morning drive time in Asian time zones.) It is then followed by *Bloomberg Daybreak Europe*, originating from London, on Monday to Friday 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. ET (morning drive time GMT). Finally, *Bloomberg Daybreak Americas* is live until 7:00 a.m. ET from New York, Boston, Washington DC and San Francisco*.* Through these programs, Bloomberg Radio offers a start to the business day globally, via the Bloomberg Radio+ Mobile App and via its live stream on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Terminal. During each day, the network broadcasts over 20 live interviews with economists, market analysts, and other influential newsmakers on shows such as *Bloomberg Surveillance* with Tom Keene and Michael McKee which airs weekday mornings from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. ET.

### Bloomberg Radio Network

Bloomberg Radio's 24/7 programming is syndicated by Key Networks to local radio stations across the country.

The Bloomberg Radio Network is also the leading provider of short-form business news reports to radio stations around the country. The network provides live, custom business reports to major all-news radio stations including WINS in New York City. The network provides "Bloomberg Money Minute" reports at :20 and :50 past the hour. It also provides daily specialty reports including the "Small Business Report", the "Business of Sports Report", the "Bloomberg Pursuits Report on Luxury", the "Real Estate Report", the "Green Business Report, and the "Black Business Report".

Since April 30, 2018, Bloomberg Radio content has been syndicated in Canada by Bloomberg's local partner Bell Media Radio. The company operated two business news stations branded as *BNN Bloomberg Radio*, which featured audio simulcasts of programs from Bell's BNN Bloomberg cable network, and other Bloomberg Radio programs. CFTE (1410 AM) in Vancouver was the first Canadian station to carry the format. It was joined in 2021 by CKOC (1150 AM) in Hamilton, Ontario. CFTE was closed by Bell Media Radio in June 2023; while CKOC was sold and dropped Bloomberg programming in August 2024.
