## Liv-ex Products


### LWIN

LWIN (Liv-ex Wine Identification Number) is the universal wine identifier. Liv-ex created it in 2011 to provide a standardized numbering system that is designed to avoid errors in communication, transfer and referencing. It removes the need to rely on written descriptions and provides the key to establishing which item in one database corresponds to which item in another database, which is helpful in transactions between organizations.

The unique seven-digit numerical code is designed to quickly and accurately identify an individual fine wine product. It enables messaging between systems and over the internet, allowing the trade to share information more easily.

Each LWIN refers to the wine itself i.e. the producer, brand or vineyard. The first six numbers of the code represent each wine's unique identifier, while the seventh number is a “check digit” that minimizes input errors. Additional information including the vintage, pack and bottle size can be appended to the LWIN in a standard format.

The LWIN standards for including additional data are:

* LWIN: 1234567 – Example winery, Cabernet
* LWIN-11: 12345672012 – Example Winery, Cabinet, 2012
* LWIN-16: 1234567201200750 – Example Winery, Cabernet, 2012, 750ml bottle capacity
* LWIN-18: 123456720121200750 – Example Winery, Cabernet, 2012, 12 bottles of 750ml each.

For Liv-ex, LWINs are a foundation for the fine wine Exchange, from managing and sharing price data to maintaining the efficiency of their settlement and distribution services.


### Wine Matcher

Wine Matcher is a web-based, artificial intelligence tool that allows merchants to take lists and transform them into a standardized set of wine names and formats with unique IDs (LWINs). These IDs can easily be shared with other systems or entered into a database for comparison in a matter of minutes. It can also return the clean list with wine price data – such as Market Price or last trade – from Liv-ex.

In 2017, Wine Matcher was awarded "Supply Chain Initiative of the Year" by *The Drinks Business*. The judges called it a “very clever innovation” that “has far-reaching and practical implications for the fine wine trade”.


### Automation

Liv-ex Automation allows members to automate their interactions with Liv-ex.

The technology that makes this work is known collectively as APIs (Application Programming Interface). APIs allow Liv-ex's platform to communicate with merchants' system or website, without any need for human intervention.

Liv-ex provides its members with market analysis, including in-depth reports and market updates. They cover new releases in their News and Insights section, as well as weekly trade, and interviews with important figures in the wine industry.

Liv-ex also publishes annual coverage on the Bordeaux En Primeur campaign, as well as Power 100 – their list of the most powerful brands in the fine wine market in conjunction with *The Drinks Business*.
