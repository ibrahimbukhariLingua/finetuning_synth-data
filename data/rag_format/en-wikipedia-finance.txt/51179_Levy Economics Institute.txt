Levy Economics Institute


# Levy Economics Institute



Founded in 1986 as the **Jerome Levy Economics Institute**, the **Levy Economics Institute** of Bard College is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy think tank. The purpose of its research and other activities is to enable scholars and leaders in business, labor, and government to work together on problems of common interest. Its findings are disseminated—via publications, conferences, seminars, congressional testimony, and partnerships with other nonprofits—to a global audience of public officials, private sector executives, academics, and the general public. Through this process of scholarship, analysis, and informed debate, the Levy Institute generates public policy responses to economic problems.

The Levy Institute is housed on the campus of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, located 90 miles north of New York City. Blithewood, a Georgian-style manor at the campus's western edge, is the institute's main research and conference facility. Designed as a private residence by McKim, Mead and White alumnus Francis L. V. Hoppin, it was completed in 1900. The house and grounds, which includes an Italianate garden overlooking the Hudson River, were incorporated as part of Bard College in 1951.


## Current research

The Levy Institute has 18 scholars and 50 research associates. Their research focuses on such issues as stock-flow consistent macro modeling, monetary policy and financial structure, financial instability, income and wealth distribution, financial regulation and governance, gender equality and time poverty, and immigration/ethnicity and social structure.
The Levy Institute is known for its research in heterodox economics, specifically in Post-Keynesian and Marxian Economics.
