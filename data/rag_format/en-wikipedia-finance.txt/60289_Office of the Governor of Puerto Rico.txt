The **Office of the Governor of Puerto Rico** —commonly called ***La Fortaleza*** (English: *The Fortress*)— consists of the immediate staff of the Governor of Puerto Rico, as well as multiple levels of support staff reporting to the Governor. The Office is headed by the Governor and its headquarters are located at *La Fortaleza*. The Office used to be called the **Office of Puerto Rico**.


## Background

All executive offices as created by law are ascribed either to the Governor or to the Office of the Governor. However, in virtue of the executive powers vested upon the Governor by Article IV of the Constitution and Law No. 104 of 1956 —which include the faculty to appoint officers and to delegate functions— the Governor issues an executive order and thereafter delegates the management of almost all the executive offices to the Chief of Staff. Only two offices, the Office of Management and Budget and the Planning Board remain in direct relation to the Governor afterwards due to the executive powers vested in the Governor by Article IV of the Constitution and Law No. 104 of 1956.


## Direct offices

The Office of the Governor of Puerto Rico, commonly known as La Fortaleza, includes several direct offices. These are:

* Office of Management and Budget - a Cabinet-level office, and the largest office within the Office of the Governor of Puerto Rico.
* Planning Board - created in the May 12, 1942 during Rexford G. Tugwell's governorship as the Puerto Rico Planning, Urbanization, and Zoning Board, is the only government agency in charge of centralized planning under the American flag.
* Secretariat of Governance - the umbrella organization and government agency of the executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico that manages and oversees all the executive departments of the government of Puerto Rico and almost all executive agencies.

These offices report directly to the Governor and are crucial for the administration and governance of Puerto Rico.


## Delegated to the Chief of Staff

* Environmental Quality Board
* Office of the Inspector General
