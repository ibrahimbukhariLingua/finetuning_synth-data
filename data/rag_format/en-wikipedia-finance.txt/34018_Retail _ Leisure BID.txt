Retail & Leisure BID


# Retail & Leisure BID



**Retail & Leisure BID** is a business improvement district (BID) that represents over 650 businesses in the retail and leisure heart of Liverpool's city centre, covering a total area of 49 acres and including 61 streets, such as Bold Street, Church Street, Lord Street, the Cavern Quarter, Whitechapel, Williamson Square, Queen Square, Ranelagh Street and all inter-connecting streets. The BID aims to enhance the public services of the local authority by raising a 1.2% levy on its members' annual business rates. This five-year program is intended to provide a safe, clean, attractive, and well-promoted trading area within Liverpool's city centre.

Its core objective is to improve the experience for shoppers, visitors, and workers in the city center and establish the high standards necessary to support Liverpool's reputation as a premier European city. Key shopping centers in the area include: Cavern Walks, Clayton Square, Metquarter and St. Johns.

It operates under the umbrella of Liverpool BID Company, and it is a limited company by guarantee. It reports quarterly to an executive board and to an operating board whose members are re-elected annually at its Annual General Meeting (AGM). In May 2013, the BID sought to enter a third term through a ballot of its members, which would run until October 31, 2018.

However, in November 2013, the BID's Chief Executive, Ged Gibbons, was suspended without any explanation given.


## History

The concept of BIDs originated in North America, where the initiative was developed in the 1970s.

In the UK a national BID pilot program was launched by the UK Government through the Regional Development Agencies. Liverpool Stores Committee and Liverpool City Council applied to establish City Central as a pilot BID in 2003.

The pilot period allowed businesses to understand the advantages and the role of BIDs within city centre management. Moreover, it gave enough time to develop business consultations, elaborate a proper business plan and strengthen networking and partnerships. Safety, event and marketing initiatives were established as tasters of a fully fledged BID.

After the approval of the Business Improvement District Regulations in 2004 by the UK Parliament, the creation of a proper BID was possible. The ballot took place in 2005 for a period of 3 years. It won the ballot with 62% in favour by numbers and 51% of the rateable value.

The second ballot was in 2008 for period of 5 years. Its influence area was increased in the second ballot due to Bold Street joining the BID. In the second ballot City Central 64% of the businesses were in favour and 68% by rateable value.


## Area

Liverpool is ranked as one of the UK's top five retail destinations and in the top 25 in Europe. The Main Retail Area is formed by City Central (49 acres) and Liverpool One (42 acres).

There are different areas within City Central:

* Church Street + Lord Street

They are the main retail streets in Liverpool city centre. Most of the anchor tenants are located here. It is the border between City Central and Liverpool ONE.

* Bold Street

Bold Street is regarded as one of the UK's best shopping streets due to its eclectic and charismatic retail mix of independent shops, cafes and bars. The Church of St Luke (AKA Bombed-out Church) is situated at the top end. Bold Street is included in the RopeWalks area, which is one of the most important night time economy areas in Liverpool.

* Metquarter

Metquarter, opened in 2005 and is a luxury shopping centre consisting primarily of boutique stores located on Whitechapel in Liverpool city centre and home to 40 stores. Metquarter is the third largest shopping centre in the city, behind Liverpool One and St. Johns. Recent new tenants include Jack & Wills, Illamasqua and Carluccio's.
