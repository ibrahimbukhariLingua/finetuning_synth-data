## Education and early life

Rotella was born on May 28, 1963, in Danbury, Connecticut, to Irene Rotella, a banker, and Louis Rotella, a US Navy World War II veteran and carpenter. He lived there through high school and graduated from Danbury High School in 1981 where he was class treasurer. In college, Rotella became interested in computer science and business and pursued degrees accordingly. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1985 with bachelor's degrees in mathematics and economics. Rotella was a member of the fraternity Alpha Chi Rho and served as chapter president during his junior year. During his years at Penn, computers were becoming increasingly popular and user-friendly for both business and home use and represented a promising career.


## Career at AMS and AIG (1985–2006)

Rotella started his career in 1985 at the now-defunct computer consulting company American Management Systems (AMS), where he held various positions including chief technology officer for AMS's Insurance Technology Group. Rotella worked at AMS for 14 years, from 1985 after his graduation until he joined AIG.

Rotella joined American International Group in 1999 as a vice president. In 2000 he became AIG's global chief technology officer, a position he held until 2003 when he became the chief information officer of AIG's Domestic Brokerage Group.

## Career at Moody's and Verisk (2006–2016)

In December 2006, Rotella joined Moody's Corporation as the senior vice president and chief information officer, a position he held for nearly three years until October 2009. Before joining Moody's, Rotella's primary role had always been a focus on *information technology*. At Moody's, Rotella's career took a turn toward a principal focus on *supporting overall business strategy* with his background in IT. The change was demonstrated in a January 2007 press release, where Rotella was quoted after being named CIO of Moody's with the following:

> Having been a CIO in another organization, this is exciting for me because I have a seat at the management table...It's exciting to be able to deliver on technology while being a core contributor to business strategy.

Rotella joined Verisk Analytics in October 2009, the same week as their headline-making, record October 6, 2009, initial public offering which was the biggest IPO of any American company since that of Visa in March 2008. Rotella has continued his shift from an IT executive to a business strategy executive who focuses on IT at Verisk. According to Verisk, he is "responsible for the development and execution of information technology initiatives at Verisk Analytics in support of the company's business operations." Verisk CEO Frank J. Coyne acknowledged Rotella upon announcing the appointment of a new CIO, saying, "With IT management experience spanning more than 23 years in diverse industries, Perry is an acknowledged thought leader in information technology...He brings a wealth of professional IT accomplishments to our organization."

In 2013, Rotella became responsible for Verisk supply chain analysis business as its group executive. He oversaw 3E, Cargonet, and Maplecroft.
