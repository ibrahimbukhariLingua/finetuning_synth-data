In 1960 he started his professional career as salesman. From 1965 to 1967 he worked at the Indo-Norwegian Project on development aid in Kerala.

From 1981 to 1983 he also presided over the employers' association Federation of Norwegian Industries, having been vice president from 1979 to 1981.

In 1991 he left the post as chief executive to become chair of Orkla ASA, following the merger between Nora and Orkla. He held this position for one year. From 1992 to 1993 he was the vice president of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. He was then the rector of the Norwegian School of Management from 1993 to 1997, and the president of Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise from 1997 to 2001.
