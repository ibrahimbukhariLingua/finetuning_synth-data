# Economy of Bratislava



The Bratislava Region is the wealthiest and economically most important region in Slovakia, despite being the smallest by area and having the second smallest population of the eight Slovak regions. The majority of governmental institutions, including the Ministry of Finance and the central bank, as well as many Slovak private companies and subsidiaries of multinational companies in Slovakia have their headquarters in Bratislava. More than 75% of Bratislava's population works in the service sector, mainly composed of trade, banking, IT, telecommunication industry, tourism and others. Major factories in Bratislava include the Slovnaft oil refinery and the Volkswagen Bratislava plant. The Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSSE), the organiser of the public market of securities, was founded on March 15, 1991.


## Budget

Bratislava has a balanced budget of almost six billion Slovak korunas (€182 million) as of 2007. One fifth of that is used for investment. Bratislava holds shares in 17 companies directly, for example in the public transport company (Dopravný podnik Bratislava), the waste collection and disposal company, the water utility and others. The city also manages municipal organisations such as the City Police (*Mestská polícia*), Bratislava City Museum, ZOO Bratislava, etc.


## GDP

The Bratislava Region is the wealthiest and economically most prosperous region of Slovakia, despite being the smallest by area and having the second smallest population of the eight Slovak regions. It accounts for about 26% of the Slovak GDP. The GDP per capita (PPP) is 188% (2016) of the EU average which is the fifth highest of all regions in the EU member states.
