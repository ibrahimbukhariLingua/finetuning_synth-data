He specialized in privatizations in the U.S. and in Brazil and signaled that the bank expects to save R$3,5 billion in two years and revised deals to achieve this goal.

He was a member of the Board of Directors of Terra Brasis Resseguros and Eólicas do Sul.

He was an advisor for the Privatization programme in the Banespa, the oldest state bank of São Paulo.


## Sexual Harassment

On June 28, 2022, the Brazilian website Metrópoles published an article with multiple reports from Caixa's female employees stating that Pedro Guimarães would, in several occasions, sexually harassed them, trying to force his employees to initiate sexual relations with him. The employees' initiative resulted in a formal investigation from Ministério Público Federal, this being the first public case of sexual harassment involving a high rank employee from Jair Bolsonaro's government.

According to *O Globo* journal, Pedro Guimarães would have already been reported for sexual harassment by a colleague in another bank. Such case was supposedly concluded after the payment of a fine by the company to the other party.
