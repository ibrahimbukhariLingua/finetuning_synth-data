Warehouse bank


# Warehouse bank



A **warehouse bank** account is a bank account at a regular commercial bank in which all clientsâ€™ funds are commingled or pooled, for the purpose of concealing the client's ownership of the funds.


## Financial crime

Fraud can happen when a commercial bank loans indefinitely to a smaller mortgage lending company without enough fail-safes in place, as was the case when Trust One Mortgage owner and operator Brady Bunte committed financial crimes with a scheme he devised. As Trey Garrison of *Housingwire.com* writes, "From March 2007 through November 2008, Bunte caused Trust One to submit fraudulent funding requests on its warehouse line of credit to National City Bank. The fraudulent funding request caused National City Bank to incur a loss of $12,744,678.16."
