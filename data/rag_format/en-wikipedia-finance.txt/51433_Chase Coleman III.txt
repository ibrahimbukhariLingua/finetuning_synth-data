## Early life and education

Coleman grew up in Glen Head, Long Island. His father, C. Payson Coleman Jr., born in 1950, is a partner at the New York law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, and his mother, Kim Coleman, owns an interior design firm.

His grandfather, Charles Payson Coleman, who was managing partner of the New York law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell until his death in 1982, was married to Mimi C. Thompson (née Louise Stuyvesant Wainwright), a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Governor who surrendered New Amsterdam to the British.

Coleman followed his father to both Deerfield Academy and Williams College, where he graduated in 1997, and was co-captain of the lacrosse team.


## Investment career

Coleman started his career in 1997, working for Julian Robertson and the latter's hedge fund, Tiger Management. He had grown up with Robertson's son, Spencer, who lived close to Glen Head, in Locust Valley. In 2000, Robertson closed his fund, and entrusted Coleman with over $25 million to manage, making him one of the 30 or more so-called "Tiger Cubs", fund managers who started their fund management careers with Tiger Management. “I’ve known Chase since he was a young boy on Long Island and a good friend of my son Spencer,” [Julian] Robertson said.

Coleman serves as partner of the investment firm he founded, Tiger Global Management. The hedge fund was an early investor in both Facebook and LinkedIn.

On the *Forbes* 2019 list of the world's billionaires, he was ranked #458 with a net worth of US$4.5 billion. According to *Business Insider*, he was born into "old money" and has made a lot of "new money" as well. According to *Institutional Investor*, he made an estimated $2.5 billion in 2020.


## Political contributions

In 2012 Coleman donated US$31,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and US$5,000 to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. He has also donated to Democratic candidates, including $10,000 to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, $4,950 to Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, and $2,700 to New York Senator Charles Schumer.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
