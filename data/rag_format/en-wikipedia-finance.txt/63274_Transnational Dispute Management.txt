# Transnational Dispute Management



**Transnational Dispute Management** (*TDM*) is a peer-reviewed online journal published by Maris B.V. *TDM* focuses on the management of international disputes, especially the rapidly evolving area of investment arbitration as well as other significant areas of international investment (such as for example oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, mining and utilities). *TDM* publishes articles covering both formal adjudicatory procedures (mainly investment and commercial arbitration) and also mediation and other ADR, negotiation and managerial ways to manage transnational disputes efficiently. *TDM* started publishing in February 2004. Professor Thomas W. Wälde (1949–2008) was founding editor of *TDM*. Mark Kantor is the current Editor-in-Chief of *TDM*.

*TDM* publishes both regular issues and Special Issues. Articles in *TDM* are often instantly "advance published" on-line and then incorporated into regular issues when those issues are fully organized. In addition, *TDM* maintains a Legal & Regulatory Materials database available to subscribers.
