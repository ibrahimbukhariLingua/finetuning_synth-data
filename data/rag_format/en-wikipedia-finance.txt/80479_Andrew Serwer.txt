## Biography

From 1995 to 1998, Serwer was a senior writer at *Fortune*. In 1997, he gained attention for writing an online column, then a novelty, called "Street Life" about the personalities and stories on Wall Street. "Achaea had Homer, the Spanish Civil War had Hemingway, California had the Beach Boys, and now our hyperactive stock market has its own poet-singerâ€”Andy Serwer," James Collins wrote in the May 22, 2000, issue of *The New Yorker*. The column later evolved into "Captain's Blog."

He has written a number of *Fortune* cover stories, including profiles of Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Cisco CEO John Chambers.

Serwer was named managing editor of *Fortune* in November 2006, replacing Eric Pooley. In August 2014, Serwer left the company when executives appointed Alan Murray as the new top editor.
