## History

FreedomPay was founded by Thomas Durovsik in 2000.

In 2007, FreedomPay developed a gateway for credit card processing (FreeWay) that captures detailed transaction data. That data can be mined for real time intelligence from disparate systems, giving merchants insight into their sales. Using that data, FreedomPay launched a cloud-based platform as a service (PaaS) and a first generation incentive platform.

In 2013, FreedomPay was selected by Microsoft as its commerce platform partner for the global banking and retail sectors.

In 2014, FreedomPay earned PCI validation for its point-to-point encryption solution (P2PE). FreedomPay was the first fully functional platform solution in North America to achieve PCI validation, including support for NFC and EMV payments.

In 2023, Amazon Web Services integrated Amazon One with the company’s commerce technology platform.

Partners with QikServe (since 2018), J.P. Morgan, Elavon (2024), Citi Teams, and WorldPay.


## Products


### FreedomPay Commerce Platform

The FreedomPay platform is a commerce solution that includes mobile payment capabilities, high-level security, incentive technologies, and business intelligence that integrates with live POS systems.



### Mobile payments and incentives

The mobile application connects consumers’ smartphones to the FreedomPay commerce platform at physical merchants. In addition to allowing mobile payments through the use of QR codes, the mobile app delivers targeted incentives, replaces loyalty cards, and provides access to electronic copies of receipts.

Merchants utilizing the FreedomPay Commerce Platform have the ability to create offers and loyalty programs. These offers can target users based on a number of criteria, including purchase history as well as user-input information. Users within the merchant-chosen distance can see active incentives within the mobile application and apply them to their bill at checkout.

The FreedomPay platform allows users to automatically accrue loyalty points. Loyalty rewards are also more flexible. For example, a user could redeem points for a discounted meal or accrue more points and redeem them for a vacation day. Points can also be awarded by financial institutions.


### Business Intelligence

FreedomPay Business Intelligence is a piece of the Commerce Platform and provides real-time analysis of business transactions for merchants utilizing the FreedomPay Commerce Platform. Merchants are able to view detailed business reports online and in real time, giving them perspective on their retail practices and the effectiveness of individual incentives and programs.


### Stored Value

FreedomPay Stored Value is a cashless payment solution, that provides corporate clients such as universities, hospitals, and corporate cafeterias with an option for stored value spending. According to the US Treasury, a Stored Value proponent, the benefits of a program like this are the speed provided, flexibility in funding, POS integration, and data collection.

FreedomPay Stored Value cards allow contactless payments and mobile payments at payment terminals.

Funding options include automated funding through bank accounts, credit or debit cards, and payroll deduction, as well as manual funding using those as well as cash and checks. Integration with most major POS systems keeps FreedomPay Stored Value system adoption costs at a minimum.

The online portal for Stored Value allows FreedomPay clients to use that information for a number of purposes, from distributing basic monetary-value vouchers to rewards based on eating habits.
