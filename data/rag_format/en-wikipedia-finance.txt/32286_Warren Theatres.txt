Warren Theatres


# Warren Theatres



**Warren Theatres** was a movie theater chain based in Wichita, Kansas, United States. While the company was founded by Bill Warren, he sold ownership of most of the Warren Theatres locations to Regal Entertainment Group in 2017. The sale excluded two theaters that were in development and the Palace Theatre in Springfield, Missouri (the location is now closed).


## Overview

As of December 2010, the Warren Theatres owned and operated eight theatre complexes in three states. Warren Theatres operated five theatres named the Warren Theatres, with three in Wichita, Kansas, one in Moore, Oklahoma, and one in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Warren Theatres also operated one theatre, named the Palace Theatre, a second-run location. Warren Theatres also operated a five-screen multiplex called the Movie Machine that was located in Towne West Square mall, which was taken over by Boulevard Theatres and reopened in 2022.

Warren Theatres' IMAX was at one point the top grossing IMAX in North America.

The Warren Theatres location in Old Town Wichita was a main venue for the Tallgrass Film Festival, an international, independent film festival. This location was closed in 2023 during bankruptcy proceedings of Regal's parent company, Cineworld, after a revised lease agreement could not be reached with the property owner for Regal Warren Old Town. The property has yet to officially find a new owner.

In April 2018, Regal announced the closure of the Palace West location in Wichita. The final day of screenings occurred on April 8. The Movie Machine was closed in November 2020. In July 2021, Regal would reach agreement with property owner Arvest Bank to reopen the Midwest City location that Warren had closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19.

As of 2020, the website of Warren Theaters is inactive which means the company has fully absorbed into Regal Cinemas.


## Midwest City, Oklahoma

In February 2017, Bill Warren announced the return of the Warren Theatres name to a new 14-screen cineplex in Midwest City, Oklahoma. Originally slated for July 25, 2019, the theatre opened August 23 of that year. The theatre closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and on September 5, 2020, the property was foreclosed. The theatre was offered at a sheriff's auction sale in January 2021, but a month later, Arvest Bank foreclosed on the theater following a $16.3 million lawsuit Arvest filed against MWC Warren Theatre, Inc. Property owner Arvest Bank contracted with Regal Entertainment to reopen the location which it did in July 2021.
