## Early life

Heine is the son of Walter Heine, who was born in Leipzig, Germany, into a family of textile merchants. His father moved to the United Kingdom in the 1930s to escape antisemitism and was subsequently sent to Australia as an enemy alien aboard HMT Dunera. In 1946 he established Heine Brothers (Australasia) Pty Ltd, which initially focused on food processing but later engaged in commodities trading.

Heine joined the family business after leaving high school and holds no tertiary qualifications.


## Career

After their father's death in 1978, Heine and his brother inherited the family company. He briefly moved to England to run an investment company, Heine Bros England, but it was liquidated in 1981. The brothers subsequently expanded into property management, as Heine Management, and investment and mortgage finance, as Heine Finance.

In 1986, Heine and his brother publicly listed their holding company Eurolynx, retaining a 25 percent stake. In the same year, Eurolynx bought Wheatley Communications, which held several radio station licences in New South Wales and Victoria, for $90 million from Heine's friend Glenn Wheatley. It was quickly onsold to Hoyts for $130 million and renamed Hoyts Media, but the nominal profit was eventually reversed following a revaluation as Eurolynx maintained a 25 percent holding. In 1993 Heine Management bought Australia's then-tallest building, 120 Collins Street, for $286 million.

In 1999 Heine sold his shares in Heine Management to Mercantile Mutual, a subsidiary of ING, for $112 million. He used the proceeds to established Netwealth "with a handful of staff and a business plan to build an online platform for financial advisers to manage their clients' investments on offering dozens of products with state-of-the-art technology". It reportedly took five or six years to break even. In 2017, he listed Netwealth on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Its share price rose 44 percent on the first day of trading.
