## History

SORAS Group started its operations on 15 November 1984 as **Société Rwandaise d’Assurances**, as a subsidiary of Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP) International, to offer insurance services in Rwanda.

On 27 September 2010, the firm was transformed into a holding company with two subsidiaries i.e. SORAS Assurances Generales Limited and SORAS VIE Limited. To which it transferred its short and long term businesses to respectively. This was in order to comply with the Rwandan Law no 52/2008 of 10/09/2008 which obligated insurance companies to split short term and long term activities.

In 2012, as part of its regional expansion goal, SORAS Group acquired 33% of shares of an insurance company in Burundi, **SOCAR SA**. This new acquisition led to the change of the company's meaning, SORAS, from **Société Rwandaise d’Assurances** becoming **Société Régionale d’Assurances**. The name change was to reflect the Group's status as a regional company.

During the financial year 2013, SORAS Group though its subsidiaries SORAS Assurances Generales Limited and SORAS VIE Limited lost its controlling stake in Agaseke Bank after major changes were made in the bank's shareholding structure.
