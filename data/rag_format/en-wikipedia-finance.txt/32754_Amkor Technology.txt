## Etymology

Amkor self-publishes that the name "Amkor" is a portmanteau of the words "America" and "Korea".


## History

Amkor's origins can be traced back to ANAM Industries, a business in Seoul dealing with imported Japanese goods, including bicycles, and founded by Hyang-Soo Kim in 1935. In March 1968, ANAM Industries underwent a transformation into ANAM Industrial Co. Ltd., becoming South Korea's first semiconductor business. One month later, his son Joo-Jin (James) Kim founded Amkor Electronics, Inc. and inaugurated its sales office in Philadelphia. Its semiconductor production and export began in 1970. In 1998, Amkor began publicly trading on Nasdaq.

In 2000, Amkor acquired Integra Technologies, an Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly And Test (OSAT) provider in United States. In 2005, Amkor spun off Integra Technologies.

In February 2016, Amkor fully acquired J-Devices Corp, the largest Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly And Test (OSAT) provider in Japan.

In June 2017, Amkor Technology was recognized as Supplier of the Year for 2016 by Qualcomm Technologies for a second consecutive year.

Amkor Technology has competitiveness for chip assembly by thermal compression as well as wafer level packaging. In September 2018, Amkor Technology opened a manufacturing and test plant at Longtan Science Park in Taiwan.

In 2019, Amkor Technology was ranked 2nd in overall revenue in the OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test) market.
