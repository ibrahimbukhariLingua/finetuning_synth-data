## Early life and education

Jeffrey Allen Miller was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1964. He attended the St. Mark's School of Texas, graduating in 1982.

Miller competed briefly in professional rodeo roping before attending Texas A&M University, where he received his Masters in Business Administration.


## Career

After receiving his MBA, Miller worked as a certified public accountant at Arthur Andersen, the now defunct accounting firm. Miller moved to Halliburton in 1997.

## Controversies

Simultaneous with Miller's assumption of executive responsibilities at Halliburton have been a series of controversies. Miller was the company's president in 2015, when Halliburton—in the face of the oil downturn—terminated 35,000 jobs (40% of its workforce). As the largest contributor to global fracking, the company faces ongoing criticism regarding its ecological impact.
