## History


### As Hewlett-Packard

Hewlett-Packard was founded in 1939 by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, who both graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company started off in the HP Garage in Palo Alto, California.

In March 2015, HP announced that Bang & Olufsen would become the company's new premium audio partner for its computers and other devices. This replaced the partnership with Beats Electronics that ended upon being acquired by Apple Inc. in 2014.

On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was split into two companies. Its personal computer and printer businesses became HP Inc., while its enterprise business became Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company. HP Inc. retains Hewlett-Packard's pre-2015 stock price history and its former stock ticker symbol, HPQ, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise trades under its own symbol, HPE.


### As HP Inc.

In May 2016, HP introduced a new PC gaming sub-brand known as Omen (reusing trademarks associated with VoodooPC), including gaming laptops and desktops (with the latter offering options such as CPU water cooling and Nvidia's GTX 1080 graphics, and promoted as VR-ready), and other accessories (such as monitors) designed to cater to the market.

In May and August 2016, certain assets were sold to OpenText, including TeamSite and Exstream.

In November 2017, HP acquired Samsung Electronics' printer division for $1.05 billion.

In February 2021, HP announced its acquisition of Kingston's gaming division HyperX for $425 million. The deal only includes computer peripherals branded as HyperX, not memory or storage. The sale was completed in June 2021.

In February 2022, HP announced it had acquired the Edinburgh-based packaging development company, Choose Packaging, in an effort to strengthen its capabilities in the sustainable packaging vertical.

In March 2022, HP announced the acquisition of the California-headquartered communications software and hardware provider Poly Inc. in an all-cash transaction. HP said the cash amount agreed was $40 per share, which implied a total enterprise value of $3.3bn, inclusive Poly's net debts.

In May 2024, HP announced that its PC models would adopt a new branding nomenclature, with most of its consumer computer models (besides Omen) folded under the Omni brand, with OmniBook (a revival of an old brand that was defunct in 2002 after acquiring Compaq that year), OmniStudio and OmniDesk models. The new Omni brand of computers are designed for the next generation of computers with artificial intelligence, using AI-powered hardware and software. As of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the brand currently coexists with HP's other existing products not powered by AI.


### Attempted merger with Xerox

On November 5, 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that print and digital document company Xerox was contemplating acquiring HP. The company unanimously rejected two unsolicited offers, including a cash-and-stock offer at $22 per-share. HP stated that there was "uncertainty regarding Xerox's ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration" (especially given that Xerox is a smaller company in terms of market cap than HP), and noted the company's aggressiveness. On November 26, 2019, Xerox issued a public letter defending allegations by HP that its offer was "uncertain" and "highly conditional", and declared its intent to "engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP Board to do the right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity."

Xerox stated in January 2020 that it would propose the replacement of HP's board of directors during its next shareholder meeting in April 2020. In a statement to *TechCrunch*, HP disclosed a belief that Xerox's bid was being "driven by" activist shareholder Carl Icahn. Xerox raised its bid to $24 per-share in February 2020.

On February 21, 2020, HP instituted a shareholder rights plan to fend off Xerox's pursuit of a hostile takeover. Four days later, HP announced that, if shareholders rejected the Xerox purchase, it planned on offering $16 billion in capital return between fiscal 2020 and 2022, including $8 billion in additional share buybacks and raising its "target long-term return of capital to 100% of free cash flow generation". HP criticized Xerox's bid as a "flawed value exchange" based on "overstated synergies". On March 5, 2020, HP rejected an offer at $24 per-share.

On March 31, 2020, Xerox rescinded its bid to buy HP Inc, citing that "the current global health crisis and resulting macroeconomic and market turmoil" had "created an environment that is not conducive to Xerox continuing to pursue an acquisition of HP Inc."

### Sports sponsorships

HP started involvement in Formula One sponsorship beginning with the 2002 British Grand Prix, replacing Compaq as title sponsor of Williams F1 from 2002 to 2005, during the period when Willams F1 was still using BMW engines as part of a partnership with BMW at the time. The 2005 British Grand Prix (which was the last time HP sponsored Williams F1) was known by some as the breakup between Williams and BMW, due to the team switching over to Cosworth engines the following season. Compaq had previously sponsored Williams F1 during the 2000 and 2001 British Grand Prix prior to being acquired by HP in 2002.

In July 2013 HP agreed to extend the sponsorship agreement with Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. This took over the original agreement between the club and Autonomy PLC who HP acquired. HP took over as the club's principal partner for the 2013–14 season.

In February 2024 HP signed a 3-year sleeve sponsorship deal with Real Madrid, being the first sleeve sponsor of the club's 121-year history.

In April 2024 HP announced that they have signed a "multi-year" deal to become the title sponsor for the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team, extending to the team's F1 Academy and esports programmes. Their logo would appear on both the team's 2024 car, the Ferrari SF-24, and the race suits of drivers Carlos Sainz Jr. and Charles Leclerc. Alongside the branding deal, HP will supply the team with services "ranging from computers, printers and other hardware to conferencing technology."


### Carbon footprint

HP reported total CO₂e emissions for the twelve months ending October 31, 2023, at 19,764,400 tonnes CO₂-equivalent and plans to reduce emissions 60% by 2025 from a 2015 base year.
According to a press release issued on April 20, 2021, HP seeks to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.


## Controversies


### Blocking third-party ink cartridges

In 2016, HP introduced firmware in its printers that disabled the printers if users used ink or toner cartridges which did not contain “new or reused HP chips or electronic circuitry.” As a result, HP faced scathing criticism (such as that from the Electronic Frontier Foundation) and paid millions in class-action lawsuits, such as to certain customers in the US ($1.5 million), Canada ($700,000 CAD), Australia, and Europe ($1.350 million), but without admitting wrongdoing. HP's stated that the firmware was intended to provide "the best consumer experience" and "protect" customers from "counterfeit and third-party ink cartridges that do not contain an original HP security chip and that infringe on our IP."

In 2023, *PC World* reported that HP printers still prevent users from using third-party ink.


### Disabling all-in-one printers

In 2023, HP was sued over allegations that it intentionally designed its all-in-one printers not to perform scanning or faxing when they were low on ink.


### Disabling ink cartridges

In February 2019, How-To Geek published an article reporting that HP remotely disabled ink cartridges when the user cancels their Instant Ink subscription.


### Xinjiang region

In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands, including HP Inc, of being potentially connected to forced Uyghur labor in the Chinese Xinjiang province.

In 2022, in response to the U.S. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, HP responded, "HP is committed to respecting human rights across our global supply chain and we prohibit the use of involuntary labor of any kind. HP also commits to respecting fundamental rights and freedoms defined in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in an approach consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as outlined in our Human Rights Policy."


### Israeli conflicts

In 2023, HP as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has come under criticism for Hewlett-Packard Israel's products under provided to the Israeli Police, Israeli Prison Service, and Israeli Population and Immigration Authority. The BDS movement has called for consumers and organizations to boycott all HPE IT services and products as well as printers, computers, and printer cartridges from HP Inc.


### Obsolescence practices

A French association called Halte à l'Obsolescence Programmée (HOP) has filed a complaint against the printer manufacturer HP, accusing it of planned obsolescence practices. The complaint alleges that HP artificially blocks printers when it detects a cartridge as empty, even if there is ink remaining. HOP argues these practices force consumers to purchase new cartridges unnecessarily, contributing to waste and environmental harm.
