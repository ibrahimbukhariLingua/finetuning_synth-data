## Financial activities

Remsha became involved in finance in 1993 at Bauman Moscow State Technical University when the Russian securities market was still in its infancy.

By the end of the 1990s Remsha's business interests were focused on brokerage services. Finance-Analytic obtained a license from the Federal Securities Commission and gained membership in NAUFOR, the Moscow Stock Exchange, MICEX and RTS. Later the ticker that was assigned to Finance-Analytic in the trading system operated by RTS. FINAM, the acrynymn deriving from "Finance-Analytic" and the letter "M" standing for Moscow, became the name of the investment holding. The company was one of the first in Russia to serve retail investors en masse and roll out online trading services, a move that helped the company evolve into a leader on the Russian securities market.
