Central Japan Commodity Exchange


# Central Japan Commodity Exchange



**Central Japan Commodity Exchange** (C-COM) was a futures exchange based in Nagoya, Japan that closed in 2011.


## History

The exchange was established 1 October 1996 from the merger of the *Toyohashi Dry Cocoon Exchange*, the *Nagoya Grain and Sugar Exchange* and the *Nagoya Textile Exchange*, all three based in the Aichi prefecture, central Japan. Effective 1 January 2007 C-COM merged into the Osaka Mercantile Exchange. In 2010 the Japanese government amended the law governing the commodity futures industry, prohibiting unwanted solicitation. This caused increasing difficulty for C-COM and in January 2011 it ceased operation altogether.

Trading was conducted at six specified session times through the day. Commodities traded were:

* Eggs – cash settled
* Gasoil – JIS K2204 grade 1 or 2 (depending on contract month), for physical delivery
* Gasoline – JIS K2202 Grade 2, for physical delivery
* Ferrous scrap (introduced 11 October 2005) – Shindachi of various grades, for physical delivery
* Kerosene – JIS K2203 Grade 1, for physical delivery
