United States Army Financial Management School


# United States Army Financial Management School



**The United States Army Financial Management School** is in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Its mission is to provide the United States Army with military and civilian leaders trained in financial management, and develop complementary concepts, doctrine, and organization for financial management in support of American armed forces. Students take classes and train in subjects such as advanced accounting, financial analysis, accounts payable and disbursing operations, and auditing. While training, soldiers must still participate in physical training and testing.


## History

The Second Continental Congress appointed a Paymaster General of the Army on 16 June 1775, thereby creating a Pay Department consisting of finance soldiers that disbursed pay throughout the Continental Army. The Pay Department became a part of the Quartermaster Corps in 1912. In 1920 the U.S. Army Finance Corps became a separate army branch and at this point it became responsible for more than monthly pay as it took on all auditing and budgeting for the entire War Department.

In 2019, the name of the school was changed from Financial Management to Finance and Controller.
