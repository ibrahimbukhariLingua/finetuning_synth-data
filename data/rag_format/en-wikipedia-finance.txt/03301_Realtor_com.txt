## History


### Early history and public listing

Realtor.com first launched in 1995 as the Realtor Information Network (RIN), which at that time was a closed network providing proprietary information to members of NAR.

In 1996, the hosting site became public, allowing any Internet users to search for property listings, and expanded with the addition of Regional Multiple Listing Service (RMLS) listings in August. RIN grew from 32,000 property listings in December 1995 to nearly 400,000 properties by October 1996.

The site was relaunched with the name "Spot Realtor.com" at the same `realtor.com` domain name in November 1996. The site's management was assumed by a company called RealSelect, in a new partnership with NAR, funded by investment from venture capital firms. RealSelect later changed its name to Homestore, and continued to operate the realtor.com site with NAR as a partner.

Starting in 1997, Realtor.com became the exclusive online real estate listings source for several companies, including *USA Today*, NBC, and America Online (AOL). Realtor.com also entered into a partnership with Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Service, beginning in 1998.

With more than 1.3 million listings by 1999, Realtor.com had become the largest website for real estate listings, and expanded services to include virtual tours of properties.

Homestore went public in August 1999, raising $140 million in the process. NAR retained a significant equity position, but Homestore negotiated agreements with multiple listing services and brokerages to secure direct feeds of listings.


### News Corp era

News Corp purchased Realtor.com's parent company, now called Move, for $950 million in September 2014. According to comScore, Realtor.com was receiving 34.1 million unique visitors per month at the time. New partnerships were formed with Airbnb, to focus on encouraging potential home buyers to stay in neighborhoods of interest to them; and with Yelp, to provide users with information about listed properties' neighborhood amenities.

Originally located in San Jose, California, the company moved to Santa Clara in 2016.

Move acquired interior design and lifestyle website Remodelista and outdoor spaces and garden design website Gardenista in 2016 as part of Realtor.com's marketing strategy. At the time of purchase, the two sites represented 1.5 million monthly readers. In June, 2019 the company sold back the websites to founder Julie Carlson and husband Josh Groves and are now independently operated by Remodelista LLC.

As of 2016, Realtor.com claimed to display 97 percent of residential properties for sale in the United States, and reportedly received 36.7 million unique monthly visitors. The company was valued by Morgan Stanley at $2.5 billion.

Features for augmented reality and image recognition in listings were added to the Realtor.com mobile apps in January 2017. Also, the site began offering 3D tours from Matterport on its iOS app, and began offering the same technology on its website and Android app.

Move acquired Opcity, the Austin, Texas-based real estate technology company, for $210 million in 2018. The company, which developed a platform that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to match potential home buyers with agents, continued to operate as an independent business until being integrated in 2019–2020.

In 2018, Realtor.com introduced Local Expert, a digital marketing service for targeting ads to agents and prospective buyers on both the company's website and Facebook. Local Expert was expanded in 2019 to allow ad purchases for searches at the city level in addition to the ZIP Code level.

Another marketing product, Market Reach, launched in early 2020. During 2019 and early 2020, Realtor.com added a number of features to improve search options, including a commute time filter, noise overlay map, and automated value model comparisons.

In July 2020, Realtor.com introduced Sellers Marketplace to help consumers with iBuying by providing homeowners with information for comparing selling options.

In August 2020, Realtor.com launched a digital tool to help people assess the risk of flooding to a home over the course of a 30-year mortgage. In May 2022, Realtor.com added wildfire risk data to the online tool. Both integrations were a result of collaboration with the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research and technology organization that uses data and technology to predict climate-related risks.

As of mid-2020, Realtor.com was receiving approximately 68 million unique users per month The same year, Move purchased software company Avail. Avail provides tools used by landlords such as creating and marketing listings as well as collecting rent and maintenance requests.
