**GlobalScape, Inc.** (AMEX:GSB) is a software developer headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, US.


## History

Globalscape was founded in 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary of American Telesource Incorporated (ATSI). The firm's original product released in 1996 was CuteFTP, an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client application for Windows and Mac platforms. This product remains in development. The company also provides information exchange services for consumer and enterprise customers. Approximately 80% of its revenue is derived from its enterprise software product line.

These lines include products in the managed file transfer (MFT), information security (InfoSec), enterprise mobility management (EMM), and identity access management (IAM), and Software as a Service (SaaS) categories. IDC, Gartner and Aberdeen Group have published reports on these products . The EFT platform offers modules for secure file transfer (SFTP), workflow automation, HTTP/HTTPS, AS2, OpenPGP, Regulatory Compliance, Auditing and Reporting. Compliance modules help with HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, HITECH, SOX, and other regulations.

The firm also offers file synchronization and sharing services and products or FSS, which utilizes data replication and continuous data protection software for real-time enterprise collaboration file sharing and backups.

In 2000, Globalscape made a brief foray into P2P file-sharing by releasing CuteMX. CuteMX was a program that was similar to Napster but was discontinued in July 2000.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Globalscape's first cloud offering is called Managed Information Xchange or MIX. Sales and distribution partners include numerous technology distributors, such as Ingram Micro, MAPS of Mexico, and Lifeboat Distribution, and since early 2014 has pursued the North American channel distribution and reseller market.

Globalscape is member since 2007 of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which publishes the PCI Data Security Standards, the last of which is PCI DSS 3.0.

On May 16, 2016, James Bindseil announced his resignation following a very low first-quarter earnings report compared to 2015's earnings. Matt Goulet was announced as CEO and president effective immediately. Goulet was CEO until April 2019 when he died unexpectedly. Robert Alpert, chairman of the board, was later named Interim CEO.

Globalscape launched a new cloud-based MFT offering, EFT Arcus, in January 2018.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
