SnipSnap


# SnipSnap



**SnipSnap** is a mobile coupon app founded in Philadelphia that allows users to take a photograph of a printed coupon in order to find or create a mobile coupon, which can be redeemed in store.


## Overview

The app scans the text, images, logos, and barcodes within a photograph of a coupon in order to parse out all of the structured coupon content dynamically. The app uses some of this information to power features such as expiration-date reminders, location-based notifications (utilizing the store name, as well as the location of the phone), and scanable barcodes.

SnipSnap makes money through both targeted and affiliate offers. Depending on a user’s past habits and SnipSnap’s partnerships, companies, like Babies ‘R Us, can push coupons that look just like any other user-clipped coupon. For every “snip” of one of these coupons that results in an actual purchase, SnipSnap will get a kickback.

According to Mobile Commerce Daily, SnipSnap also works with retailers to manage location-based and "geo-conquesting" campaigns. The company has also begun promoting coupon content outside of its mobile apps, and via third-party social media sites, mobile aps, and ad networks.


## Background

SnipSnap, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was founded by Ted Mann in September 2011, after Mann left his job at Gannett to start the company. It was incubated at DreamIt Ventures, a startup accelerator program in Philadelphia. It has investors that include venture capital firm MentorTech Ventures, as well as Michael G. Rubin (co-founder of GSI Commerce). The company has raised $1.5 million in seed funding. In November 2013, Valpak announced a partnership to syndicate all of its coupon content to SnipSnap.
