Ian Steedman


# Ian Steedman



**Ian Steedman** (born 1941, in London) was for many years a professor of economics at the University of Manchester before moving down the road to Manchester Metropolitan University. He retired from there at the end of 2006, but was appointed as an emeritus professor.


## His work

Steedman has been recognised as one of the leading Neo-Ricardian economic theorists with work in the areas overlapping with those of Marx, Sraffa, Marshall, Jevons and Wicksteed. He has also made contributions to economic theory on time, international trade, capital theory and growth and distribution.

He is also a senior research fellow at the William Temple Foundation, and his work now includes the study of "happiness" and its relation to welfare economics.

Ian Steedman is on the editorial board of *The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought*.
