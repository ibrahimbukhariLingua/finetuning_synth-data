## Work


### Aaker Model

Aaker is the creator of the Aaker Model, a marketing model that views brand equity as a combination of brand awareness, brand loyalty, and brand associations. The model outlines the necessity of developing a brand identity, which is a unique set of brand associations representing what the brand stands for and offers to customers an aspiring brand image.

Aaker primarily sees brand identity as consisting of 8–12 elements which fall under four perspectives:

* Brand as Product – consists of product scope, product attributes, quality or value of the product, uses, users and country of origin.
* Brand as Organisation – consists of organizational attributes and local workings versus global activities.
* Brand as Person – consists of brand personality and customer-brand relationships.
* Brand as Symbol – consists of audio and visual imagery, metaphorical symbols and brand heritage.

Aaker first introduced the model in his book *Building Strong Brands* (1996).
