## History

Derby Cycle Corporation has roots in Luxembourg-based Derby International Corp. SA, a company that had purchased Raleigh Bicycle Company in April 1987. The Derby Cycle Corporation was acquired by chief Alan Finden-Crofts, former chief of Dunlop Slazenger, and attorney Ed Gottesman, from Tube Investments (TI) for £18 million, plus £14 million in assumed debt.

In 1988, Derby Group acquired the "Kalkhoff" brand from the insolvent Neue Kalkhoff Werke GmbH & Co. KG., creating the German subsidiary Derby Cycle Werke GmbH ("Derby Cycle Werke"). Kalkhoff had been founded in Oldenburg in 1919. In 1992, Derby Holding (Deutschland) GmbH was established, incorporating Derby Cycle Werke and Raleigh Fahrräder GmbH.

Derby Cycle sought U.S. bankruptcy protection on August 20, 2001. The management of Derby International, now Derby Group, acquired Derby Cycle Corporation and renamed it Raleigh Cycle Ltd.

In November 2007, Kalkhoff took over the insolvent Derby Cycle Werke's Kynast works in Quakenbrück. The initial public offering followed the successful restructuring of the Frankfurt subsidiary Finatem on 4 February 2011. The Dutch Accell Group launched a failed takeover attempt in late 2011. Instead, Derby Cycle became part of the Dutch Pon Holdings.

Pon Bicycle Group is a Dutch trading company and owns the brand Gazelle, Cervélo and Union Bicycles.
