2012 Oklahoma state budget


# 2012 Oklahoma state budget



The **Oklahoma State Budget for Fiscal Year 2012**, is a spending request by Governor Mary Fallin to fund government operations for July 1, 2011â€“June 30, 2012. Governor Fallin proposed the budget on February 7, 2011. This was Governor Fallin's first budget submitted as governor.

Figures shown in the spending request do not reflect the actual appropriations for Fiscal Year 2012, which must be authorized by the Legislature.


## Overview

The budget crisis of the 2011 Oklahoma state budget caused the Oklahoma State Treasurer's Office to estimate that the 2012 budget would see a $600 million budget shortfall. Following the December 2010 meeting of the Oklahoma State Board of Equalization, the Board certified that the 2012 budget would see a shortfall of $400 million from 2011 levels.

Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin's proposed budget relies upon a combination of agency budget reductions, increased tax enforcement, agency consolidations, and government modernization to overcome the budget shortfall. Most agencies are budgeted to receive a 5% across the board cuts, but public safety, healthcare, and education will see smaller cuts of only 3%. If the governor's budget plan is realized, the $400 million deficit will result in a $100 million surplus.
