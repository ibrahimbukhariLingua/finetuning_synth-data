In 1992, Savvides was CEO at Smith & Nephew (a UK-based global healthcare company), and BOC.

## Personal

Savvides married in November 1979. He and his wife Vivian have sponsored, starting when they married, many children through World Vision. They are committed Christians and are involved in the NewPeninsula Baptist Church where he chairs the Board.
