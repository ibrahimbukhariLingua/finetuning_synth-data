The **Central Bank of India** (**CBI**) is an Indian public sector bank based in Mumbai. Despite its name, CBI is not the central bank of India, a role served by the Reserve Bank of India.

Central Bank of India was instrumental in the creation of the first Indian exchange bank, the Central Exchange Bank of India, which opened in London in 1936. However, Barclays Bank acquired Central Exchange Bank of India in 1938.

Also before World War II, Central Bank of India established a branch in Rangoon. The branch's operations concentrated on business between Burma and India, and especially money transmission via telegraphic transfer. Profits derived primarily from foreign exchange and margins. The bank also lent against land, produce, and other assets, mostly to Indian businesses.


### Post-World War II

In 1963, the revolutionary government in Burma nationalized Central Bank of India's operations there, which became People's Bank No. 1.

In 1969, the Indian Government nationalized the bank on 19 July, together with 13 others.

Central Bank of India was one of the first banks in India to issue credit cards in the year 1980 in collaboration with Visa.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2024, Central Bank of India Governor MV Rao became chairman of the Indian Banks Association.


## Controversies

In the 1980s, the managers of the London branches of Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and Union Bank of India were caught up in a fraud in which they made dubious loans to the Bangladeshi jute trader Rajender Singh Sethia. The regulatory authorities in England and India forced all three Indian banks to close their London branches.
