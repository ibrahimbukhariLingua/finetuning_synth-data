# Otemachi Tower



The **Otemachi Tower** (大手町タワー) is a high-rise office building with integrated retail and restaurant facilities (which are also known as OTEMORI) located in the Otemachi business district in Chiyoda ward, Tokyo.

The 38-story tower serves as the headquarters of Mizuho Bank. A luxury hotel facility operated by Aman Resorts occupies the top six floors of the tower.


## Overview

The Otemachi Tower replaced the previous 16-story head office complex of Fuji Bank then of Muzuho Holdings, which had been built in 1990 on the same site and was demolished in 2012.

A major feature is a 3,600-m² green area named "Otemachi Forest" occupying one third of the site.

The building is situated above a nexus of five subway lines. The basement floors connect directly to Ōtemachi Station, as well as other nearby buildings.
