Office for the Internal Market


# Office for the Internal Market



The **Office for the Internal Market** (OIM) is that part of the Competition and Markets Authority (a non-ministerial department) responsible for overseeing the UK internal market. Its objective is to monitor the UK internal market by reporting every year and at least every 5 years on the functioning of the internal market to the Parliament of the United Kingdom and devolved parliaments, and to conduct reviews and provide economic analysis of the impact of regulatory differences across the four nations of the UK.

Any of the four governments around the UK can submit a request from the OIM to examine a regulation, and businesses can bring any issues they might have regarding the UK internal market to the OIM through its webform.
