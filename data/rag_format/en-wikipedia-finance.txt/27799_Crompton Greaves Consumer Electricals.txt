The company was established in 1937 as Crompton Parkinson Works Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crompton Parkinson. In 1947, it was acquired by Karam Chand Thapar. The company was established in 2016 as an outcome of the demerger of Crompton Greaves Limited which separated the latter's consumer goods business from the power and industrial systems segment. The demerger plan was announced in July 2014 and it was completed in 2016 with the creation of CG Power and Industrial Solutions and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Limited.

## Controversies

In November 2017, Reuters reported instances of "prescient messages" regarding the performance of 12 Indian companies in WhatsApp groups and it included Crompton. The information contained upcoming quarterly results, including specific metrics such as net profits, revenues, and operating margins. At that time, the matter was investigated by India's Securities and Exchange Board of India for insider trading by brokers. Later, in 2021, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) set aside the SEBI's order because the latter was failed to prove insider trading connection among and between the brokers.
