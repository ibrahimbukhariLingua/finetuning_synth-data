## History

Seymour Direct was formed in 1987 by an independent retailer to negotiate lower rates for credit card processing, their aim was to relieve small to medium businesses of the high charges that were set by the high street banks. Although they offered their services to larger businesses, their main clients were B&B's and Beauty Salons.

In 2013 Seymour Direct were the first merchant services providers to offer Contactless payment terminals that small businesses could directly hire without the need to apply for brand name Visa payWave or MasterCard payPass.

Seymour Direct is now one of the UK's leading independent sales organisations distributing credit and debit card processing services to small to medium businesses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
