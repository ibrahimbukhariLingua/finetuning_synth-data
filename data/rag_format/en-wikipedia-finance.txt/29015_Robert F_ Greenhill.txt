### Personal life and philanthropy

Robert was married to Gayle (nee Gussett) Greenhill in September 1958 in her hometown of Des Moines, Iowa and they remained married until her death on October 12, 2017. They moved to Boston when Robert attended HBS and then in 1962, moved to New York which became their home town as Robert started his career on Wall Street. They had three children, and instilled into the family their sense of adventure. In 1975, the two were dropped together with four others by an airplane at the Arctic Circle to spent a month travelling north with three canoes for 500 miles without guides from Beechey Lake in Nunavut, Canada on the Back river through to the Arctic Ocean. That trip made them subjects of a DuPont advertisement in 1977 touting Kevlar-skinned canoes. They later took their children on similar trips to the far north. In addition, Robert had a pilot's license with more than 15,000 hours logged in command over 20 years, flying all over the world, often accompanied by his wife, who eventually got her own pilot’s license at age 50.

They were both very involved with the HBS alumni, and their three children and their spouses are all graduates of the school. Greenhill’s many contributions to HBS include service on the School’s Visiting Committee and Centennial Global Business Summit Steering Committee, as well as leading roles in reunion fundraising. In addition to the family’s support for global research, in 1987 Greenhill endowed the Robert F. Greenhill Award, given annually by the HBS Dean to members of the HBS community who contribute to HBS in significant ways. In 2003, HBS named a building on campus "The Greenhill House" (formerly Humphrey House) in their honor, in appreciation of a significant gift, first major gift of its kind, that established the Gayle and Robert F. Greenhill Family Endowment for Global Research that provides permanent funding to support the School’s international research and course development activities. Currently the building provides administrative space for the HBS Global Initiative, which was launched in 1996 to deepen the School’s long-standing focus on international course development and research by facilitating closer ties with companies, academic institutions, and alumni worldwide. In 2009, Greenhill received the HBS Alumni Achievement Award, given to alums who have contributed significantly to their companies and communities.

The collection includes works by 103 artists, among them giants of photography, including Frank, Edward Steichen, Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherma, William Eggleston, László Moholy-Nagy, André Kertesz, Charles Sheeler, Imogen Cunningham, In addition to masterworks by established figures, the Greenhills collected a wide variety of documentary and press photography, much of it unattributed.
