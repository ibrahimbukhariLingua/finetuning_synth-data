Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance


# Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance



The **Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance** was established in 2015, and is a part of the Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge. The Centre is a research and education institute focused on researching technology-enabled financial innovation and its interplay with policy, regulation, supervision and infrastructure.

CCAF’s approach includes publishing empirical research, creating digital tools to provide data and insights, and hosting learning opportunities, events, and online capacity building programmes for regulators and industry stakeholders to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to navigate the evolving financial innovation landscape. The centre includes 4 dedicated research clusters and a Capacity Building and Education Team.

CCAF aims to inform policymakers, regulators, governments and industry stakeholders about alternative financing instruments, channels and systems emerged outside of the traditional financial sector as well as underlying technologies. Since its inception, the centre's main research activity includes benchmarking the growth of alternative finance across different geographies and sectors via annual reports for major regions and countries. Another principal research field focuses on the evolving digital assets sector, including studies on the development of cryptoasset industry and enterprise blockchain as well as related cryptoasset regulation. The centre has also published research on regulatory and supervisory innovation, and regulatory and policy implications of the emergence of FinTech firms.


## History

CCAF was founded in January 2015 and aims to address the knowledge gap on technology-enabled financial innovation and related regulatory, supervisory, and infrastructural innovation around the world. The CCAF has worked with over 6,000 FinTech companies, and more than 300 Central Banks and other financial authorities in over 195 jurisdictions.

The centre has produced more than 50 reports on a variety of topics including cryptoassets, supervisory technology, fintech regulation and digital payments.

In 2022, CCAF saw major expansion with the establishment of the Cambridge Suptech Lab and the Cambridge Digital Assets Programme.


## Clusters

The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance achieves its research goals through four distinct yet integrated research clusters, which work collaboratively to produce knowledge products and services such as reports, digital tools and capacity building and education programmes.


### The Cambridge SupTech Lab

Launched in 2022, Cambridge SupTech lab focuses on technology and innovation in supervisory technology.

Since 2023, SupTech Week is an annual event hosted by the Cambridge SupTech lab where regulators and suptech providers gather to discuss SupTech, participate in educational opportunities, and connect with key stakeholders in suptech.


### The Cambridge Digital Assets Programme

The Cambridge Digital Assets Programme (CDAP) was created in 2022. The programme produces datasets, insights and publicly available digital tools which provide insights into the development and intricacies of digital assets worldwide.

The CDAP focuses on three main research areas, which include Climate Aspects of Digital Assets, Distributed Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI), and Emergent Money Systems.


### The Cambridge Regulatory Innovation Hub

The Cambridge Regulatory Innovation Hub (RegHub) leverages the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance’s expertise to boost regulatory knowledge and capacity for safe, inclusive digital financial services.

The RegHub achieves its aims by conducting empirical studies on regulatory innovation, creating digital tools using research data and findings, and by organising capacity building and educational programs for regulators and policymakers worldwide.

Additionally, the RegHub develops and manages the Regulator Knowledge Exchange (RKE), a digital platform that enables FinTech regulators, policymakers, and supervisors to connect, coordinate, cooperate, and collaborate.


### The Cambridge Fintech Market Observatory

The Cambridge Fintech Market Observatory (CFMO) leverages a decade of research to study alternative financing. It aims to provide robust fintech data for market development and regulation, launching the ‘Future of Global Fintech Research Initiative’ with the World Economic Forum, which collaborates with a research panel of over 220 institutions to research the latest development in the global fintech sector.

Major reports from the CFMO include the Global State of Open Banking and Open Finance Report, an in-depth study of the Open Banking and Open Finance landscape across 95 jurisdictions.


## Capacity Building and Education (CB&E)

The Capacity Building and Education (CB&E) team at CCAF offer capacity building and educational programs for regulators and policymakers, support evidence-based policymaking, and provide a platform for global collaboration and knowledge exchange.

The CB&E strives to make a global impact, fostering knowledge sharing both within and outside the organization, promoting collaboration across teams and dissemination of research.

Through CB&E, the CCAF has provided courses to 28 cohorts, educating over 3,000 individuals in the process. Graduates from CB&E programmes include members of more than 300 financial authorities. The programmes include a compulsory capstone project to ensure impact at participant organisations, with a total of over 800 projects.
