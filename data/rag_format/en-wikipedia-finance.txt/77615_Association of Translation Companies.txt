## History

The Association of Translation Companies was formed in 1976 by leading British translation companies keen to promote the use of professionally produced, high quality, translation work by professional translation companies, to support the UK's exporters.

Since its inception, the ATC has played a pivotal role in the development of European language services. It was the driving force behind the establishment of the European Union of Associations of Translation Companies, and one of the original developers of the European translation services standard EN 15038, a precursor to the international translation services standard ISO 17100.
