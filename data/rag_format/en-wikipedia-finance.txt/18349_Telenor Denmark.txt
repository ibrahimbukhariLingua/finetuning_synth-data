## History


### Sonofon

Sonofon was founded as a company in 1991 as a joint venture between GN Store Nord and BellSouth Corporation. On 9 September that year, Sonofon was awarded the license to operate Denmark's first GSM 900 mobile network (while the second GSM license was later awarded to Tele Danmark). Sonofon launched its services in September 1992 and saw its mobile base grow rapidly to half a million users by 1996. On 11 January 1998, Sonofon launched Denmark's first prepaid SIM cards, and in 2000 Sonofon launched GPRS on its network.

GN Store Nord sold its 53.1% stake in Sonofon for 13.1 billion DKK on 13 June 2000, and on 10 December 2003, Telenor acquired BellSouth's stake for 3.05 billion DKK.

In 2006, Cybercity initiated a tight cooperation with Sonofon, sharing headquarters on Frederikskaj in Copenhagen (where Sonofon's main administrative sections are housed), and even going as far as using Sonofon-hired and trained consultants within Sonofon's main call centre as a secondary base of customer service operations.


### Tele2

In May 2007, Telenor announced the purchase of the Danish operations of the competing ISP Tele2, with the Danish commission of monopoly approving the purchase (later the approval was announced to the press, currently the main press release).


### Cybercity

**Cybercity** was a name of a leading Danish internet service provider owned by Telenor. The company has its own nationwide core network, and serves both consumer and business customers. Cybercity has reported more than 186,000 DSL customers in its report for the first quarter of 2007, with more than 380 employees.
