## History

In 1999, Matrix was acquired by Platinum Equity, a global private investment firm specializing in M&A&O.

In 2001, Matrix integrated Staples Communications (Staples, Inc.) customers into its operations through an acquisition made by Platinum Equity, and with the purchase of Global Crossing’s Small Business Group in 2005, Matrix launched the Matrix Business Technologies brand to differentiate and focus its market presence between residential and commercial services.

Platinum Equity acquired the assets of Trinsic Communications (formerly Z-Tel) in June 2007 and integrated them into Matrix, This addition deepened the residential customer base within Matrix and broadened its national footprint of services. The brand was changed to "Trinsic, Powered by Matrix"

On March 16, 2010, Matrix announced it would acquire the customers and substantially all the assets of Dallas-based Excel Telecommunications. That transaction closed on August 2, 2010, with the Excel headquarters in Irving, Texas becoming the new headquarters for the combined companies.
