House of Dawda Group


# House of Dawda Group



The **House of Dawda Group** is a privately owned conglomerate in Uganda.


## History

The group traces its beginnings to 1962, when its founder chairman, Hasmukh Dawda, began a trading business in neighboring Kenya. Having dropped out of school at age 13, he first began trading in confectioneries, before he eventually raised enough capital to start manufacturing his own.

In 1991, the group set up the Britania biscuit manufacturing in Kampala. In 1996, the group acquired the company Uganda Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (UPL, manufacturer of medicine in Uganda, from the government in 1993), and sold 30% of it to Libyan investors in 2016. From 1990 to 2016, the group invested over $75 million in development.

In 2002, the group acquired the Kenyan business formerly known as House of Manji, which was under receivership. After reviving the business, it was renamed Manji Food Industries Limited.
