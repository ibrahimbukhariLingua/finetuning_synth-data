Cefic supports the Paris Climate Agreement and a strong action on climate change in line with the scientific advice provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Cefic also supports the European Green Deal and Europe’s ambition to become climate neutral by 2050.


## History

The *Conseil Européen des Fédérations de l'Industrie Chimique (Cefic)* was created in 1972.

In 1990, the association changed its name to *European Chemical Industry Council* to reflect the integration of the chemical companies. The Cefic acronym was nevertheless retained.

On October 15, 2020, Dr. Martin Brudermüller, CEO of BASF, was elected President of Cefic. In 2022, he was re-elected. Brudermüller succeeded Mr. Daniele Ferrari (Versalis, Eni), who held the position from 2018 till 2020.
Mr. Marco Mensink (previously Royal VNP) is the Director General of Cefic since May 2016.
