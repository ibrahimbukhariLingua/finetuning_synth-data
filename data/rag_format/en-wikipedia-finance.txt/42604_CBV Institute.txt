CBV Institute


# CBV Institute



The **CBV Institute** (**French: *L’Institut des CBV***), formerly known as the Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators (CICBV), is a Canadian business valuation organization. The CBV Institute is a not-for-profit valuation professional organization that establishes the practice standards, educational requirements, and ethical guidelines for its members.

The Chartered Business Valuator (CBV) (French: *Experts en Evaluation d’Entreprises (EEE)*) designation is a credential for business valuation professionals in Canada. CBVs are governed by The Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators. CBVs quantify the value of a business, its securities, or its intangible assets. CBVs use a variety of valuation methodologies to arrive at a conclusion, and explain their approach, methodology and conclusions in an easy to understand manner. Various approaches used include asset-based approaches (liquidation, adjusted net book value), return-based approaches (capitalized earnings, capitalized cash flows, discounted cash flows), and market-based approaches (comparable company multiples). In the context of litigation, CBVs quantify the damages or losses arising in a legal dispute.


## History

The CBV Institute was founded in 1971 by 28 valuation professionals under the leadership of George Ovens. At the time, the introduction of taxation of capital gains in Canada facilitated the general need for business valuation.


## Education requirements

After completing the institute's comprehensive Program of Studies (which includes six courses dealing with business valuation, Canadian taxation, the law, and litigation support), completion of the Membership Qualification Exam (held annually), and obtaining practical experience requirements, candidates are then admitted to the membership.

Students must take four courses as part of their education requirements:

CBVs also have continuing professional development requirements.
