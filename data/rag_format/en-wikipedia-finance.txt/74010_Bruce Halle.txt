His French-Canadian grandfather, Alfred Antoine Halle, had come to Berlin, New Hampshire, from Quebec in the mid-1880s with his wife and two sons. As a young boy, during the Great Depression, he supported his family by delivering newspapers, cutting grass and digging graves. Bruce's parents returned home with their two sons to Berlin, where they would lived with Molly's parents at a home few blocks from St. Kieran's Catholic Church. His father became a firefighter at the Berlin Fire Department and later made deputy chief. In 1942, his family moved to Detroit, where Fred worked as a security guard at the Ford Motor Company's Rouge River plant in Michigan. In 1950, Bruce went to enlist in the US Marine Corps and served a tour of duty in the Korean War. He later settled in Michigan and graduated with a BBA from Eastern Michigan University in 1956.


## Career

After graduating from college, he took a series of jobs by selling cars and life insurance. He tried unsuccessfully to form a partnership with his high school friend, Bill DiDonato, on an auto supply distribution company in Ypsilanti, Michigan and by late 1959, the business went bankrupt.

In 1960, he borrowed $400 and opened a tire store in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1964, he opened his second store and by 1970, he had seven stores in Michigan and expanded to Arizona that same year. It later became known as Discount Tire, and grew to over 1000 stores in 28 states by 2018.
