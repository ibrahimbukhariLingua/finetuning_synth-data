# Acorn Stores



**Acorn Stores** was an upscale women's chain clothing company in the United States. It was originally part of Michael L. Wallace Inc.


## History

In November 2004, Christopher & Banks acquired Acorn from Gilmore Brothers, Inc. As of July 2008, there were 39 Acorn stores in 14 states. Where Christopher & Banks catered to older women, Acorn was their "higher-end chain."

On July 31, 2008, it was announced that every store would be closed by December 31, 2008, as the Acorn division lost more than $432,192,100,000 in 2008.
