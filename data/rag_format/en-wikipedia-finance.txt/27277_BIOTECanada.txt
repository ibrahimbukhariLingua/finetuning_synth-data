BIOTECanada


# BIOTECanada



**BIOTECanada**, previously the **Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada**, is a Canadian biotechnology industry association based in Ottawa, Ontario. It is an industry-funded membership organization composed of over 250 national and international pharmaceutical and gene therapy companies, medical device manufacturers, agricultural science businesses, law firms, academic institutions, research and development networks, advertising agencies, insurance companies and financial services firms.

BIOTECanada and the University of Western Ontario jointly administer the Gold Leaf Awards, presented annually to individuals and organizations who are deemed to have made significant contributions to Canada's biotechnology sector.


## History

The organization was incorporated in 1987 as the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada.

Health Canada partnered with BIOTECanada in May 2012 to organize a summit on clinical and regulatory topics associated with biosimilars. The event was held in association with the International Alliance for Biological Standardization, and was observed by representatives from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. Panelists included representatives from academia, regulatory bodies and industry, such as UMass Memorial Health, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the Robarts Research Institute, Alberta Blue Cross, Mount Sinai Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.

In 2017, BIOTECanada published a report detailing proposed initiatives to use biotechnology to address issues including population growth, climate change, food security, health, and economic instability. President and CEO Andrew Casey sent a letter in July 2017 to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada proposing measures to offset costs of patent filings, and to reduce taxation on intellectual property revenues.


### COVID-19

Several representatives of BIOTECanada participated as members and advisors in the COVID-19 Therapeutics Task Force convened by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

In June 2022, BIOTECanada hosted the Canada Pavilion at the BIO International Convention, an annual biotechnology conference led by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO).
