## History

In 1993, the company was founded as **Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise Pte. Ltd**. (**SALE**) by Singapore Airlines and Boullioun Aviation Services, Inc., a U.S.-based aircraft operating leasing company. In 1995 acquired its first aircraft and in 1996 placed the first order with Airbus. In 1997, Temasek Holdings and Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) invested into the company.

In 2000, the company was reported to be the largest customer of the Airbus' single-aisle aircraft in Asia.

In July 2004, SALE underwent a change in its shareholder structure, following the transfer of the 35.5% stake held by Seattle-based Boullioun Aviation Services to the US lessor's parent company WestLB AG of Germany. The remaining ownership then of SALE was unchanged, with Singapore Airlines holding 35.5%, while GIC and Temasek Holdings each retaining 14.5%.

In 2006, SALE was the largest aircraft leasing company in Asia. In December, the company was acquired by Bank of China for US$965 million and was named BOC Aviation on 2 July 2007.

On 12 May 2016, the company was converted to a public company limited by shares and the company's name was changed to BOC Aviation Limited.

On 1 June 2016, the company was listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
