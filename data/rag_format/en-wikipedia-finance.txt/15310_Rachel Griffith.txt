## Research


### Obesity

Griffith's presidential address to the European Economic Association at the University of Mannheim, Germany entitled "Gluttony and Sloth? Labour Market Nonseparabilities and the Rise in Obesity", reflected her recent research into the relationship between changes in relative food prices and the nutritional quality of householdsâ€™ shopping baskets.


### Corporation tax

In her Royal Economic Society Public Lecture 2015, "Does Starbucks Pay Enough Tax", Griffith argued that corporate tax should be charged like VAT. Griffith stated that the current system of corporate taxation is outdated and taxing corporate profits in the location where value is created is not very meaningful. She suggested taxing profits at the destination of sales rather than at the source of profits would be an improvement. Griffith cited two papers, one by Auerbach and Devereux (2012), the other by Devereux and Vella (2014), in support of her case. Griffith's previous research in this area considers how influential corporate income taxes are in determining where firms choose to legally own intellectual property, i.e. the way in which intellectual property accounts for firms' assets and if they can be used by firms to shift income offshore to reduce their corporate income tax liability.
