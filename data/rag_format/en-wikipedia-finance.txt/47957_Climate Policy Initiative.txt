Climate Policy Initiative


# Climate Policy Initiative



The **Climate Policy Initiative** (CPI) is an independent non-profit research group and international climate policy organization based in San Francisco, California with other offices worldwide. CPI is supported primarily by philanthropic organizations and government development finance.

With over 100 analysts and advisors the climate think tank works to improve energy and land use policies around the world, with a particular focus on finance. It is considered a leader expert group in tracking global climate finance.
Beginning with the *Landscape of Climate Finance* (2011), CPI has published a series of annual reports which examine both public and private financial flows worldwide. CPI also publishes in-depth case studies on the public sector's mobilization of private
investment.
As of 2021, CPI reported that flows of climate-related finance in and between countries account for only about 0.7% of the worldâ€™s GDP, far below the amount that is projected to be needed for climate mitigation and adaptation. The San Giorgio Group (SGG), a working group established by CPI and others in 2011, focuses on ways in which financing can support green low-emissions investment.
