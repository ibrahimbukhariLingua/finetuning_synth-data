Tip and Trade


# Tip and Trade



***Tip and Trade*** is a 2011 true crime book by Canadian author Mark Coakley, that depicts an insider trading conspiracy involving Wall Street lawyer Gil Cornblum who had worked at Sullivan & Cromwell and was working at Dorsey & Whitney, and a former lawyer, Stan Grmovsek, who were found to have gained over $10 million in illegal profits over a 14-year span. The crime was detected in 2008. Cornblum committed suicide by jumping from a bridge as he was under investigation and shortly before he was to be arrested but before criminal charges were laid against him, one day before his alleged co-conspirator Grmovsek pled guilty. Grmovsek pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 39 months in prison; this was the longest term ever imposed for insider trading in Canada.


## Reception

Canada's national newspaper, *The Globe and Mail*, called *Tip and Trade* "riveting." A review by *Quill & Quire* was negative, stating that "the reader gets the impression that Coakley himself barely cares about his subject." *Canadian Lawyer* called it "compelling," and the *Winnipeg Free Press* called it "a helluva tale, if uneven in spots."
