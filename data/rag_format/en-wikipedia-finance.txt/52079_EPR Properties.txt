# EPR Properties



**EPR Properties**, formerly **Entertainment Properties Trust**, is a real estate investment trust based in Kansas City, Missouri, that invests in amusement parks, movie theaters, ski resorts, and other entertainment properties. It owns 353 properties as of 2022.


## History

Entertainment Properties Trust was created by AMC Entertainment executive Peter Brown and financial analyst David Brain. They decided to establish a REIT focused on megaplex movie theaters after failing to find an existing REIT to help finance AMC's development of theaters. The company was incorporated on August 22, 1997. It held its initial public offering in November 1997, raising $278 million. By March 1998, Entertainment Properties had purchased 13 AMC theaters in sale-and-leaseback transactions.

In 2005, the company established VinREIT, a subsidiary focused on vineyard properties. It purchased a portfolio of six vineyards and wineries from Constellation Brands in 2008 for $115 million. By 2010, the company was "evaluating" VinREIT after a downturn in the wine industry, and in 2011, all of the wine properties were put up for sale. The sales were completed by 2014.

Entertainment Properties Trust began investing in charter school properties in 2007, primarily through a deal with Imagine Schools. By 2012, the company owned 41 schools.

The company changed its name to EPR Properties in 2012 to reflect its diversification into recreation and education properties.

In 2015, Brain retired as chief executive officer.

In 2017, EPR bought a portfolio of properties from CNL Financial Group for $456 million, comprising the Northstar California ski resort, 15 waterparks and amusement parks, and 5 small family entertainment centers.

In November 2019, the company sold its portfolio of charter schools for $454 million.
