MidFlorida became a state-chartered credit union in 2009, shortening the company name to MidFlorida Credit Union.

On June 15, 2010, MidFlorida and Bay Gulf Credit Union announced a merger between the two credit unions, which added Bay Gulf's approximately 20,000 members and $140 million assets to MidFlorida then 130,000 members and $1.4 billion assets. As a result of the merger, MidFlorida gained access to the Tampa Bay area and expanded services to all or part of 14 Florida counties.


### Space Coast acquisition

Near the end of 2011, MidFlorida Credit Union and Space Coast Credit Union announced that MidFlorida would acquire six Tampa-area branches from Space Coast, based in Melbourne, Florida.

The merger added Indian River's 9,100 members and $55.5 million assets to MidFlorida, giving the credit union two additional branches in Vero Beach and Sebastian, Florida. These conversions expanded MIDFLORIDA's ability to provide services across the state, from the Tampa Bay market (Hillsborough and Pinellas County) to the Treasure Coast.

In November 2019, MidFlorida Credit Union completed two mergers, one with Ocala, Florida based bank Community Bank & Trust and First American Bank. MidFlorida will acquire all assets of Community Bank & Trust while only acquiring the Florida Assets for First American Bank.

The merger with Community Bank & Trust was the largest bank merger with a credit union in history.
