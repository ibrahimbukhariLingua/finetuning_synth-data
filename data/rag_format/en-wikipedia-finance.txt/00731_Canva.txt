## History


### 2013–2020

Canva was founded in Perth, Australia, by Melanie Perkins, Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams on 1 January 2013. One of the companies' early investors included Susan Wu, an American entrepreneur. In its first year, Canva had more than 750,000 users. In April 2014, Guy Kawasaki joined the company as its chief evangelist. In 2015, *Canva for Work* was launched, focusing on marketing materials.

During the 2016–17 financial year, Canva's revenue increased from A$6.8 million to A$23.5 million, with a loss of A$3.3 million. In 2017, the company reached profitability and had 294,000 paying customers.

In January 2018, Perkins announced that the company had raised A$40 million from Sequoia Capital, Blackbird Ventures, and Felicis Ventures, and the company was valued at A$1 billion. Australian superannuation funds Hostplus and Aware Super are known to be investors.

The exposed data included real names of users, usernames, email addresses, geographical information, and password hashes for some users.
