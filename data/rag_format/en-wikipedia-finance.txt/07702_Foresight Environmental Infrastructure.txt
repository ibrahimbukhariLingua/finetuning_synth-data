# Foresight Environmental Infrastructure



**Foresight Environmental Infrastructure**, formerly JLEN Environmental Assets Group and John Laing Environmental Fund, (LSE: JLEN) is a large British investment trust dedicated to investments in Renewable Energy Infrastructure. The chairman is Ed Warner. Established in March 2014, the company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.


## History

The company was established in March 2014. Foresight Group took over responsibility for managing the fund from John Laing Capital Management in June 2019. In August 2024, the company launched a £20m share buyback programme. Because the shares were trading at a significant discount to asset value, the company proposed holding a vote on discontinuation at its annual general meeting in September 2024.

The company changed its name to Foresight Environmental Infrastructure in September 2024.


## Operations

The company invests in wind farms, and solar energy farms and also has a portfolio of anaerobic digestion projects, as well as several green hydrogen projects, and energy storage projects.
