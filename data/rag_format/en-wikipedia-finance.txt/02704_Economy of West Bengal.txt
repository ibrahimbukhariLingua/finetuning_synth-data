Economy of West Bengal


# Economy of West Bengal



The **economy of West Bengal** is a mixed middle-income developing social market economy and the largest Eastern Indian economy with a substantial public sector. It is the India's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP.

West Bengal is the primary business and financial hub of Eastern India. The state is primarily dependent on agriculture and medium-sized industry. West Bengal has jute and tea industry. West Bengal is rich in minerals like coal, limestone, iron ore, copper, lead and zinc.

Since the independence of India, The Green Revolution bypassed the state. However, there has been a significant spurt in food production since the 1980s.


## Agriculture and livestock

Agriculture accounts for the largest share of the labour force. It contributed around 17.77% to the gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2024–25. A plurality of the state's population are peasant farmers.


### Major produce

Rice and potato are considered to be the principal food crops. The state is the largest source of the important food crop of rice, a staple diet across India, with an annual output of around 16.76 million tonnes (about 13% of total production in India) in FY 2021–22, and the second-largest producer of potatoes in India with an average annual output of 12 million tonnes (about 20% of total production in India) in FY 21–22. West Bengal is also the second-largest fish producing state in India after Andhra Pradesh with an annual production of 20.45 lakh tonnes.¹⁶

Apart from these, jute, sugarcane and wheat are the top crops of the state.¹⁴ Other major food crops include maize, pulses, oil seeds, wheat, barley, and vegetables. Tea is another important cash crop. Darjeeling is globally recognised for tea plantation of the acclaimed Darjeeling tea variety.

There are up to 10,000 registered factories in the state and the West Bengal state government has opened Shilpa Sathi (শিল্পসাথী), a single window agency in order to provide investors with all kinds of assistance in establishing and running industrial units.

Kolkata is noted as one of the major centres for industries including the IT industry. The planned cities of Bidhannagar and New Town, Kolkata are major IT hubs of East India. As of April 2019, Sector V of Bidhannagar had approx 1,500 companies.

New Town has emerged as the second IT hub of Kolkata after Salt Lake. Growing number of tech parks makes New Town a preferred destination for IT and ITes in East India. Several Information Technology majors are operational like Ericsson, Accenture, Capgemini, Tech Mahindra, ITC Infotech, Mindtree, Adani Labs, British Telecom, TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Cognizant etc. New Town also houses Bengal Silicon Valley Tech Hub.

Bengal Silicon Valley Tech Hub is an under construction technology hub in the Indian state of West Bengal, consisting of various tech parks, buildings, projects and premises which work on the sectors like IT/ITeS, Data Centre, E-commerce, IoT, KPO, AI, R&D and Telecom.

However, a decade later the company became loss-making until it was revived in 2006 when it merged with the Steel Authority of India. Modernisation at IISCO Steel Plant has helped the city develop at a very rapid pace. The plant's capacity will be raised from 0.4 MT to 2.5 MT of saleable steel, using what will be the biggest blast furnace in the country. As of 2015, the investment for modernisation was the single largest investment in West Bengal till then.

### Semiconductor Fabrication Plant in Kolkata

Under a transformative collaboration with the United States, India will get its first-ever national security semiconductor fabrication plant that will produce chips for use in military hardware in both the countries as well as in critical telecommunication networks and electronics. The ambitious India-U.S. joint project was announced following talks between PM Narendra Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden in Wilmington on September 21, 2024. The first-ever India-US semiconductor fabrication partnership was described as a "watershed arrangement", according to a joint fact sheet on Modi-Biden talks.

The fab, which will be established with the objective of manufacturing infrared, gallium nitride and silicon carbide semiconductors, will be enabled by support from the India Semiconductor Mission as well as a strategic technology partnership between Bharat Semi, 3rdiTech, and the U.S. Space Force. It will not only become India's first, but one of the world's first multi-material fab for national security. This facility will produce advanced semiconductors for advanced sensing, communication and power electronics, marking the first tech partnership between Indian businesses and the U.S. Space Force, as well as the first of its kind within the Quad group.

GlobalFoundries will set up GF Kolkata Power Center in Kolkata that will enhance mutually beneficial linkages in research and development in chip manufacturing and enable game-changing advances for zero and low emission as well as connected vehicles, internet of things devices, AI, and data centers. The semiconductor fabrication plant will be named "Durga Shakti".

It has two asphalt runways, the primary one extended by 700 meters (3627 × 46m) and upgraded to CATIIIB, and the secondary one (3190 × 46m) upgraded to CATII ILS standards. Its terminal is a new and sprawling L-shaped six-level integrated terminal of over 2,510,000 sq ft inaugurated in 2013, able to handle 25 million passengers per annum. It includes check-in counters that use CUTE (Common User Terminal Equipment) technology, 78 immigration counters, 12 customs counters, passenger lounges provided by Air India and Jet Airways, 18 aerobridges, 57 remote parking bays, 2 underground two-leveled carparks and car parking facilities in landscaped area capable of handling 5000 cars. The airport has a Centre for Perishable Commodities (CPC), two luxury hotels and a shopping mall.
