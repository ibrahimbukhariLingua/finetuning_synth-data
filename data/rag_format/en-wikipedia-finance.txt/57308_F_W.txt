## History

F+W was named after two of its early publications: *Farm Quarterly* and *Writer's Digest*. The company grew though a series of acquisitions, including book publisher David & Charles, Krause Publications in 2002, *Horticulture* magazine, and Adams Media in 2003. The private equity firm ABRY Partners purchased F+W in 2005. In August 2012 F+W Media acquired Interweave, an arts and crafts media company based in Loveland, Colorado. In 2014, F+W Media acquired New Track Media, renamed itself F+W, and was acquired by the private equity company Tinicum.

In 2008, the company began to focus more on e-commerce activities and offering products and services related to the content of its magazines. The e-commerce business grew from one store with $6 million in revenue in 2008 to 31 e-commerce stores with more than $65 million for 2015.
In May 2017, some creditors received a 97% stake in the company in exchange for debt relief and a new line of credit.


## Demise

In January 2018, with the CEO and two other top executives leaving the company, F+W slashed its workforce by 40%.

F+W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 10, 2019. The book publishing assets of the company were won by Penguin Random House at a bankruptcy auction in June 2019. The grouping of the assets drew criticism. Several properties including *Sky & Telescope* were sold individually.
