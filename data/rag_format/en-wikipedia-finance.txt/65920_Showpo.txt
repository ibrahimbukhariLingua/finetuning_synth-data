## History

In 2010, Showpo was launched as "Show Pony" by co-founder Jane Lu, initially operating from her parents' garage in Balmain, Sydney. Three months after launch, the company opened a bricks and mortar store in Broadway in Sydney, followed by a kiosk in Pitt St Westfield in August 2011. In 2012, Showpo had its first million-dollar month with just four staff. Showpo closed its profitable bricks and mortar stores in 2013 to focus its business solely online. In 2014, the company turned over $10 million in sales and by 2017 it had reached a run rate of $30 million.

In August 2017, Showpo held its official US launch in Los Angeles, the location of its US warehouse.
