K-Startup Grand Challenge


# K-Startup Grand Challenge



**K-Startup Grand Challenge** is a startup accelerator program supported by the Government of South Korea. The program was launched in 2016 by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA) and funded by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups of South Korea. The program is based in the Pangyo Techno Valley, known as the Korean version of the Silicon Valley.

As part of the government's policy, South Korea has initiated a wide range of support programs for startups and has been investing nearly $2 billion annually into the Korean start-up ecosystem since 2013. Within the scope of these efforts, the government organized the K-Startup Grand Challenge program to invite foreign start-ups to come to Korea and cooperate with local VCs and companies. Inviting start-ups from overseas is also aimed at assisting Korea's evolution into a prominent startup business hub.
