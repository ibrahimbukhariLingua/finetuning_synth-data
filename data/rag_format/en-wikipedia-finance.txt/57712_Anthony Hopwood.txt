In 1965, he moved to Chicago as a Fulbright scholar to attend the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago. There he completed his MBA and PhD.

He was a lecturer at the Manchester Business School from 1970 to 1973. He then taught at the London Business School before moving to the London School of Economics.

## Research

Hopwood's doctoral research drew on social psychology and the sociology of group dynamics to study accounting in the context of a steel mill in Gary, Indiana. His research showed that apparently technical processes, such as the setting of budgets, were complex behavioral phenomenon. He showed that decision-makers are human, with goals that may differ from those of their organization may differ.

Throughout his career, Hopwood consistently focused on the political processes and psychological factors behind accounting. He argued that accounting is not a neutral technical phenomenon, but an intensely social process that impacts society in many ways. He insisted that accounting should be studied in its social and organizational contexts.

Hopwood's research established the basic principles and methods for research into the behavioral, organizational and social aspects of accounting.
