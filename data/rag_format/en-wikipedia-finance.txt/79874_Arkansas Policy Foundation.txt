# Arkansas Policy Foundation



The **Arkansas Policy Foundation** **(APF)** is a conservative think tank based in Little Rock, Arkansas. According to APF, the organization "emphasizes the importance of tax policy and education reform."


## Activities

From 1996-1999, APF crafted a detailed review of state government known as the Murphy Commission report. The organization has issued recommendations on education reform, ethics reform, and health care. It has proposed tax and spending cuts, including a reduction in sales taxes applied to groceries. In December 2015, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson requested that APF conduct another efficiency review in order to take a statewide look at governmental efficiency.
