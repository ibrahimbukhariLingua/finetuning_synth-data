## History and operations

The firm originated in a 1969 partnership between the lawyers Mark Leibler and Arnold Bloch. Eventually, Bloch decided to leave the partnership and have the name changed; but Leibler insisted that the name of the firm stay the same even after Bloch's departure.

The firm is involved at the boardroom level at many major Australian companies. The firm has especially strong expertise in the areas of tax law and commercial law. Its boardrooms are named for the firm's founder Arnold Bloch, Ron Castan, and Sir Zelman Cowen.

The firm is historically associated with Melbourne's Jewish community. Reasons for this include; its leading partner Mark Leibler, its association with prominent legal professionals of the Jewish faith, and its 'early clients being Jewish businessmen finding their feet in their adopted Australia'. The firm has distanced itself from past clients that have behaved in conflict with its historical roots. (such as Redbubble)

The firm additionally has a strong association with law affecting Indigenous Australians, particularly the law of native title. It has practised in the area for 30 years, with a long-standing pro-bono practice. The firm was additionally involved in the setting up of Australia's Reconciliation Action Plan program, the Uluru statement from the heart, and its partner Mark Leibler has made public statements in support of the Voice to Parliament.
