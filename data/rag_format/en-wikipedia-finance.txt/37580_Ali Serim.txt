# Ali Serim



**Ali Serim** (/ɑːˈliː/; born 1978) is an Istanbul-born Turkish author, diplomat, climate advocate, and publisher. His career spans multiple sectors, including climate change advocacy, diplomacy, public-private partnerships (PPP), and philanthropic work, particularly in support of Small Island Developing States (SIDS).


## Early career and business involvement

Serim began his career at Ernst & Young (EY) in Istanbul, working in corporate governance, compliance, project finance, and auditing. Although his family was involved in construction and maritime shipping, Serim chose to forge an independent career path. Early on, his exposure to large infrastructure projects sparked his interest in climate change, leading him to study environmental challenges as early as the 1990s.
As a corporate advisor specializing in public-private partnerships (PPP), Serim fostered collaboration between governments and private entities to deliver large-scale infrastructure projects with a focus on sustainable development. In addition to his advisory roles, Serim is an
investor, applying his expertise to projects that align with sustainable development and climate-friendly solutions.


## Baku Communiqué

A key achievement in Serim's career was his role in the development of the Baku Communiqué, a landmark diplomatic document addressing the climate change vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Developed in collaboration with Azerbaijan, Tuvalu, Tonga, and The Bahamas, the communiqué calls for immediate, unified global action to combat rising sea levels and extreme weather.
Ali Serim also worked to redefine climate finance, focusing on creating a fair and accessible model for Small Island Developing States (SIDS). He advocated for a framework emphasizing grants and direct aid instead of debt-generating instruments, which often limited SIDS’ access to essential resources. Through efforts like the Baku Communiqué, he urged COP29 to consider a revised climate finance model that would enable vulnerable nations to build resilience without accumulating unsustainable debt.


## Philanthropic work

Serim's philanthropic work centers on providing corporate donations and aid to Small Island Developing States (SIDS). He has been instrumental in creating initiatives that channel financial and material support to these vulnerable nations, helping them develop infrastructure and resilience against climate threats. His focus on government-to-government (G2G) relations ensures that these efforts are coordinated at the highest diplomatic levels, promoting long-term partnerships and sustainable development. These initiatives also actively encourage investor collaboration with diplomacy for immediate climate action. Serim's mentor, President Süleyman Demirel of Türkiye inspired his interest in democratization,
leading him to join the ARI Movement as a board member. Founded in 1994, the ARI Movement promoted youth leadership, democracy, and civic engagement through education, structural reform, and encouraging volunteerism among Turkish youth.
Serim was also a long-time supporter of Nicholas Negroponte’s One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project, which operated from 2005 to 2014, transforming education for children in developing countries by distributing educational devices and creating content to enhance learning. His commitment to cultural heritage preservation is reflected in his work with the Yıldız Palace Foundation, dedicated to the preservation and restoration of historical Ottoman heritage. These efforts in heritage preservation and addressing climate change impacts on historical sites earned him a nomination for the Europa Nostra Award, recognizing his outstanding contributions to safeguarding cultural heritage.

As an activist, Ali Serim emphasized the pivotal role of museums in education and their potential to significantly boost a nation's economy. Serim is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA), a Trustee of the Yıldız Palace Foundation, and a member of UNESCO’s Turkish National Committee on the Illicit Trafficking of Cultural Property. In 2013, he led the Yıldız Palace Foundation in a project within the Civil Society Facility – European Union-Turkey Intercultural Dialogue: Museums Grant Scheme.


## Historical work and publications


### *The Descendants of Hürrem Sultan*

Serim co-authored the historical non-fiction book The Descendants of Hürrem Sultan with journalist İnci Döndaş. The book explores the contemporary lives of the descendants of Hürrem Sultan, the wife of Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, delving into their adaptation to exile following the abolition of the Ottoman monarchy and caliphate.


### *Constantinople 1918 Konstantiniyye*

Serim curated the photography book Constantinople 1918 Konstantiniyye, published in 2015. It features a collection of photographs taken by an unknown French officer during the Allied occupation of Constantinople after World War I. Serim, a major photography collector, acquired the album decades ago, and the book documents the city's architectural and cultural landscape.


## Body art and climate advocacy

Ali Serim's journey into using body art as a protest against climate change began with his tiger tattoos, which symbolize his dedication to raising awareness about the extinction of tigers due to habitat destruction. The plight of tigers, endangered by deforestation and climate change, deeply resonated with Serim and served as the inspiration for his body art activism. His first 15 tiger tattoos became a visible expression of his commitment to environmental advocacy, focusing on the intersection of climate change and biodiversity loss. Over time, this personal protest evolved as Serim expanded his collection to over 100 tattoos, each representing different facets of environmental degradation and climate change. His body art has become a powerful platform for advocacy, sparking conversations and drawing attention to the urgent need for global action. Through these tattoos, Serim uses his body as a permanent statement supporting climate activism, highlighting the fragility of ecosystems and the broader environmental challenges facing the world today.


## Photography and publishing

In addition to his work as an author, Ali Serim is a prominent photography collector and publisher. His dedication to preserving historical photography is exemplified by his work on projects like *Constantinople 1918 Konstantiniyye*. His publishing efforts also focus on historical travel books, providing insights into environmental conditions from centuries ago, helping bridge the gap between historical contexts and today's climate challenges. These works serve as a resource for scientists and historians studying long-term environmental changes.

Ali Serim is a passionate art collector who has built a significant collection, focusing primarily on photography by renowned artists such as Ansel Adams, Yousuf Karsh, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Annie Leibovitz, Brassaï, Brian Duffy, Ara Güler, Sami Guner, and others. His collection reflects a deep appreciation for iconic photographers who have shaped the art form, blending historical and contemporary works into a distinguished body of photographic art.


## The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post contributions

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, Serim wrote over 1,000 articles as part of his meditative reflections on climate change. Using this period as a time for deep exploration of contemporary global climate challenges, he later published a selection of these writings on The Times of Israel blog, focusing on climate diplomacy and the vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). His posts highlighted urgent issues such as Loss and Damage funding, rising sea levels, and the role of business and diplomacy in achieving climate solutions. Serim also published articles in The Jerusalem Post, covering similar topics.
