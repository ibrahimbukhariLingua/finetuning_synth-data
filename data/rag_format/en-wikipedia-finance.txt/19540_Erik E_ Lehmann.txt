## Research

His research targets on the gap between globalization of firms and markets on the one hand and regionalization effects on the other. In particular, he is interested in how firms can access necessary resources such as financial capital, human capital and knowledge spillovers from their location (Spatial Resource Management), how these resources are transformed into marketable products to exploit strategic advantages in a globalized world (Organizational Capital Management) and how these processes are governed to ensure that all investors with relationship specific investments could be protected within this process (Corporate Governance).
