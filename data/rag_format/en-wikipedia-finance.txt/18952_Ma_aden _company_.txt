**Ma'aden** (stylized **MA'ADEN**; Arabic: معادن), also known as the **Saudi Arabian Mining Co.**, is a Saudi state-owned mining company headquartered in Riyadh. It was formed as a Saudi joint stock company on 23 March 1997 for the purpose of facilitating the development of Saudi Arabia's mineral resources.

## Corporate and subsidiaries

On 20 December 2009, Ma'aden signed an agreement with US aluminium giant Alcoa to build a $10.8 billion aluminium complex. Under the agreement, the two firms will build a 1.8 million tonnes per year aluminium refinery and a 750,000 tonnes per year smelter in Ras Al-Zour. The smelter is slated to start production in 2013 while the refinery would come online in 2014.

The company was primarily focused on developing the Kingdom's gold mining operations. Ras Al-Khair's complex includes a diammonium phosphate plant, an alumina refinery, smelter and rolling mill associated with the Alco joint venture, and links by rail to the phosphate mine in Waad Al-Shamal.
