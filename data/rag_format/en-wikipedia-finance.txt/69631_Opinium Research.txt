## Political poll archive

The company has freely available political voting intention polls on their website along with results from regular surveys conducted on current and topical events.

In February 2022, Opinium altered their weighting methodology. Most significantly turnout weighting changes will reduce the effect of Conservative voters who have recently moved to undecided. The effect of these changes was to reduce the Labour lead stated from about 10% to 3%. The four main changes were:

* voting intention has usually been over-stated by online survey respondents, and unequally across demographic groups, so only respondents who give a voting intention will be used and weighting as in recent general elections only applied to that group rather than jointly with non-voters;
* the number of people who have low and mid levels of attention to politics has usually been under-represented in online surveys, so sampling was improved to include an appropriate number of people who have low and mid levels of attention to politics;
* weighting on ethnicity was introduced;
* previous weighting was correct overall on education profile and age profile, but for older people graduates were significantly over-represented, so cross weighting between age, gender, and education qualifications was introduced.
