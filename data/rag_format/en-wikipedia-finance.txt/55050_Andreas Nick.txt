## Political positions

In 2019, Nick joined 14 members of his parliamentary group who, in an open letter, called for the party to rally around Angela Merkel and party chairwoman Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer amid criticism voiced by conservatives Friedrich Merz and Roland Koch. Ahead of the CDU's 2021 leadership election, Nick joined other conservatives in calling on Merkel to stay on as chancellor until her term ends in 2021, dismissing calls for her to step down sooner and hand power to the party's next leader.

In September 2020, Nick was one of 15 members of his parliamentary group who joined Norbert Röttgen in writing an open letter to Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer which called on Germany and other EU counties to take in 5,000 immigrants who were left without shelter after fires gutted the overcrowded Mória Reception and Identification Centre on the Greek island of Lesbos.
