## Professional background


### Bank of Carmel

The bank outgrew its old building, and in 1938, Segal was instrumental in the bank's move in 1939, to a new two-story concrete building for the Bank of Carmel, at the corner of Ocean Avenue and Delores Street.

It was Carmel's first commercial bank and the only 1930s Art Deco style building in Carmel.


### Carmel Investment Company

On October 15, 1936, Segal purchased the Carmel Investment Company on Ocean Avenue and San Carlos Street, from Donald Hale.


## Legacy

Segal set up the *Barnet J. Segal Charitable Trust* to distribute his estate for the benefit of Monterey County, California. Dr. Herbert and Elaine Berman of Carmel, executors of the trust, gave a $300,000 (equivalent to $599,869 in 2023) donation to the Carmel Public Library Foundation. The Barnet J. Segal Reading Room at the Harrison Memorial Library honors him and was dedicated with a special event on June 4, 1995.
