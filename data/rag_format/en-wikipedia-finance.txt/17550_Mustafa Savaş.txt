### Political career

Mustafa Savaş, who was serving as the deputy general manager at Halkbank, ran as a parliamentary candidate for the Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2011 general elections in Aydın. However, he was not able to secure a seat in the parliament as he was listed as the 4th candidate, and the AKP won three seats in that election.

He continued his political career in Aydın and in the 2014 local elections, he was nominated as the AKP candidate for the Mayor of Aydın Metropolitan Municipality. Although he received 29.1% of the vote, he finished in second place in the election.

In the June 2015 general elections, it was expected that Savaş would have a higher position on the party list. However, he was once again listed as the 4th candidate, and the AKP only managed to secure two seats. But in the November 2015 general elections, he was placed as the 3rd candidate for the AKP in Aydın. As a result of the increased vote share for his party in Aydın, rising from 29.7% to 34.4%, he earned the right to become a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) as an Aydın deputy. He assumed responsibilities in the TBMM Planning and Budget Commission.

In December 2015, he also took on a role in the party management as the deputy of Mehmet Özhaseki, the vice president in charge of local governments in the AKP.
