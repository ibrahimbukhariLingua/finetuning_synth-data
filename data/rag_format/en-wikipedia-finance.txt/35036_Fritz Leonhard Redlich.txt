## Life

Redlich was born in Berlin and educated in Germany, where he obtained his doctorate in economics in 1914, with a thesis supervised by Ignaz Jastrow. Throughout the First World War he served as a cavalry officer, and after it he took over the family business.

In 1936, he left Germany for the United States. Middle-aged, he returned to interests in the history of business and entrepreneurship dating from his student days, and sought an academic position. While teaching at minor colleges in the United States without ever acquiring tenure, he was an early and influential associate member of Harvard University's Research Center in Entrepreneurial History.

He died in Newton, Massachusetts, on 21 October 1978.
