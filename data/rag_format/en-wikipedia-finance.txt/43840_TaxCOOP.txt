TaxCOOP


# TaxCOOP



**TaxCOOP** is a non-profit Canadian policy institute dedicated to international tax competition and cooperation, independent and defending no political, partisan or national interests. Its head office is located in Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada.

TaxCOOP hosts annual conferences and publishes works, including the book *Winning the Tax Wars* (2017) and *Coordination and Cooperation: Tax Policy in the 21st Century* (2021). Several TaxCOOP conferences have been set up in collaboration with international organizations, notably the World Bank, the United Nations, and the International Economic Forum of the Americas. In 2017, TaxCOOP was selected among the fifty most influential tax organizations and personalities in the world by the English magazine, International Tax Review.


## History

TaxCOOP was set up in 2015 to promote a neutral global discussion on the subject of international tax competition, an issue that was not being addressed by global tax reform.
TaxCOOP was founded by Brigitte Alepin, UQO professor, tax specialist and author, Allisson Christians, Full Professor, Associate Dean of Research at the Faculty of Law of McGill University and Holder of the H. Hewad Stikeman Research Chair in Tax Law, Lyne Latulippe, Ph.D, Associate Professor and Principal Researcher at the Research Chair in Taxation and Public Finance at the University of Sherbrooke, and the Honorable Louise Otis, international administrative judge, president of the administrative tribunal of the OECD and adjunct professor at McGill University.


## History of the TaxCOOP Conferences

The objective of the non-partisan event was to raise awareness and stimulate reflection on the tax breaks granted by states to attract or retain investors. In 2016, the TaxCOOP2016 conference dedicated to developing countries was presented at the World Bank in Washington. In 2017, the TaxCOOP2017 conference was presented at the Palace of Nations in Geneva.
