Council on Business & Society


# Council on Business & Society



The **Council on Business & Society (CoBS)** is a global alliance open to schools of business and management with a mission to educate tomorrow's responsible leaders and promote sustainable business practices among professionals. It convenes international forums focusing on topics at the crossroads of business and society and the common good that bring together leading academics, students, policy makers, NGOs, international organisations and business leaders. Previous forums have covered the topics of Leadership and Governance, Health and Healthcare, and New Energies. The CoBS also runs a yearly student CSR article writing competition, fosters inter-school faculty exchange and CSR-specific research projects. Other activities and initiatives can be found on the website.

The Council disseminates the CSR and sustainability-centred research of the faculty from its member schools through the following:

- Bi-weekly vulgarised research articles via the Community Blog
- A quarterly issue of Global Voice magazine
- booklets on specialised CSR-related themes via CoBS Publishing
- Condensed research capsules ("Research Pods") with practical insights for practitioners, a series of online Masterclasses, and the Routledge-CoBS Focus on Responsible Business book series.
