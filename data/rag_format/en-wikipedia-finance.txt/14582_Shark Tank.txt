Shark Tank


# Shark Tank



***Shark Tank*** is an American business reality television series that premiered on August 9, 2009, on ABC. The show is the American franchise of the international format *Dragons' Den*, a British TV series, which itself is a remake of the Japanese TV show The Tigers of Money. It shows entrepreneurs making business presentations to a panel of five angel investors (providers of venture capital to early stage start-ups) called "Sharks" on the program, who decide whether to invest in their companies.

The series has been a ratings success in its time slot, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program five times (2014–2017 and 2024).


## Premise

The show features a panel of investors called "sharks," who decide whether to invest as entrepreneurs make business presentations on their company or product. The sharks often find weaknesses and faults in an entrepreneur's product, business model or valuation of their company. Some of the investors are usually kindhearted and try to soften the impact of rejection, like panel member Barbara Corcoran, while others such as Kevin O'Leary can be "brutal" and might show "no patience even for tales of hardship". The sharks are paid as cast stars of the show, but a disclaimer at the start of each episode states the money they invest is their own. The same disclaimer also states that no offer of investment is being made to the viewer. The entrepreneur can make a handshake deal (gentleman's agreement) on the show if a panel member is interested. However, if all of the panel members opt out, the entrepreneur leaves empty-handed.

The show is said to portray "the drama of pitch meetings and the interaction between the entrepreneurs and tycoons". A pitch of around 45 minutes by a contestant is edited to about 11 minutes. As of 2018, approximately 35,000 to 40,000 entrepreneurs apply each season with about 1,000 advancing to the next step, 150 getting to pitch the sharks, and fewer than 100 making it on the air; most episodes contain four pitches per broadcast hour.


### Post-show

Shark cast member Kevin O'Leary believes about 20% of the handshake deals made on the show are never executed due to the investors' due diligence process following the handshake deal, which includes product testing and examining the contestants' business and personal financials. Fellow shark Robert Herjavec believes that about 90% of those withdrawals come from the entrepreneur, in some cases due to only appearing on the program for publicity.

The show is often responsible for what has become known as the *Shark Tank* effect. Simply appearing on the show, even without getting an offer, has the potential to significantly boost sales for companies. Some entrepreneurs have reported 10- to 20-fold increases in daily revenues after the show's airing.


## Cast

Two of the show's longstanding sharks, Robert Herjavec and Kevin O'Leary, are Canadian entrepreneurs who had previously appeared on the Canadian version of the series titled *Dragons' Den*. Since 2023, Herjavec also appears on the Australian version of Shark Tank.

## Production

*Shark Tank* is produced by Mark Burnett and based on the format *Dragons' Den*, which originated in 2001 with the Japanese show, *Tigers of Money*. *Shark Tank,* however, more closely resembles the format of the British version of *Dragons' Den*, which premiered in 2005.

The show initially required each contestant to sign an agreement with Finnmax, the producer of *Shark Tank*, promising Finnmax the option of taking a "2% royalty" or "5% equity stake" in the contestant's business venture. However, in October 2013, this requirement was repealed by the network, retroactively, due to pressure from panel member Mark Cuban. Cuban felt the requirement would lower the quality of the entrepreneurs, as savvy investors would be wary of trading away a portion of their company just for appearing on the show. A number of potential entrepreneurs had declined to participate in the show for this reason.


### COVID-19 precautions

During the 12th season, the show was moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 12th season was produced in a quarantine bubble (which applied to the production staff but not the sharks or entrepreneurs themselves), the set was partially rearranged so the sharks' chairs were at least six feet away from each other, and the sharks would not come up to the entrepreneurs to shake their hands when a deal was made (a wave or "long-distance fist bump" was used instead). In future seasons, the handshakes returned but the chairs have remained separated.


## Spin-offs and specials

In 2015, ABC launched a companion series, *Beyond the Tank*, which shows the current state of companies that appeared on *Shark Tank*, including both those that made a deal and those that were rejected by investors. Two seasons of *Beyond the Tank* have aired so far, one in 2015 and one in 2016.

A prime time special titled *Shark Tank: Greatest of All Time* premiered on February 26, 2020.


## Reception


### Critical reception

During its first season, *Shark Tank* saw a mostly positive reception. Josh Wolk of *Entertainment Weekly* wrote, "The moneymen ask informed questions and make shrewd decisions, a welcome relief from Donald Trump's capricious calls on Burnett's *Celebrity Apprentice*". Heather Havrilesky from Salon said that "ABC's *Shark Tank* is easily the best new reality TV show to air this summer." Tom Shales of *The Washington Post* wrote, "It sounds gimmicky and visually tedious, with most of the so-called action taking place in a conference room. It's all those things, but the moments of misery make it memorable." Shales noted that the series was premiering during an economic recession, and that many of the aspiring entrepreneurs had poured significant amounts of money into their businesses; he praised "how deftly the show personalizes the desperation and pain experienced by victims of a broken down economy." And David Hinckley of the *New York Daily News* said, "Once you get past its somewhat misleading title, Mark Burnett's new *Shark Tank* is a well-paced hour that offers entertainment without humiliation."


### Ratings

During the first two seasons, the series barely peaked at 5 million viewers, with season 2 only having 9 episodes in its run. By season 3, the show's viewership went past 5 million and started to crack the top 100 in the ratings. By 2012, the show averaged over 6 million viewers per episode. It is the most watched program on Friday nights in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ As a result, ABC added three more episodes to the original season order of 22. In its sixth season, the series reached over 9 million per episode, becoming its most successful season to date.

## In popular culture

*Shark Tank* has been a part of several crossovers with other TV shows. Jimmy Kimmel has pitched on *Shark Tank* (pants for horses) as a comedy skit which aired on his show, *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* Disney's *Phineas and Ferb* character, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, pitched his invention on the 2013 season finale in a cross-over episode. On the Season 6 Episode "The Tank" of *Grace and Frankie*, Grace and Frankie pitch their Rise Up toilet invention to the Sharks.

*Saturday Night Live* has parodied *Shark Tank* with Chris Rock pitching a parodied ISIS asking for support in going after "Western pigs and vile Jews", prompting Daymond John to state that he found the skit "insensitive".

After the success of the original Shark Tank series, several countries have launched their own localized versions under the same name, adhering to copyright guidelines and obtaining rights to use the Shark Tank branding. Examples include Shark Tank India, Shark Tank Bangladesh, and Shark Tank Pakistan. These adaptations retain the core concept of the show, where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of investors in hopes of securing funding, thus continuing the original show's influence and format across various markets.
