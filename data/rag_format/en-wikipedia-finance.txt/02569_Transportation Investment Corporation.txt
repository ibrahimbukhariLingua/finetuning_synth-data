**Transportation Investment Corporation** (TI Corp) is a public Canadian crown corporation, established in 2008 under the Transportation Investment Act, to implement the Port Mann/Highway 1 Improvement Project, including construction, operations and maintenance of 37 kilometres (23 mi) of improvements to the TransCanada Highway through Metro Vancouver, as well as development, implementation and management of tolling operations to pay for the project.

## Port Mann/Highway 1 Improvement Project

The span of this project comprises the Vancouver area's primary goods movement and commuting corridor, serving 120,000 vehicles daily through six municipalities, with important connections to other communities throughout the region. The project was established in 2003 as part of the Provincial Gateway Program to address the problem of growing regional congestion and to improve the movement of people, goods and transit.
