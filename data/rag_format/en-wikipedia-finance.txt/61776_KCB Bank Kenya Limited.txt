## History

KCB Bank Kenya roots trace back to July 1896 when its parent company, KCB Group, was formed as a branch of the National Bank of India in Mombasa. In 1958, Grindlays Bank merged with the National Bank of India to form the National and Grindlays Bank. Upon independence, the Government of Kenya acquired 60% shareholding in National & Grindlays Bank. In 1970, the Government took full control of the bank and renamed it to Kenya Commercial Bank Group.

KCB Bank Kenya, as it is now known, was incorporated in 2015 as a result of the corporate restructure of Kenya Commercial Bank Group (KCB Group). Prior to 2015, KCB Group was both a licensed bank and a holding company for its subsidiaries. This was in compliance with the Kenya Finance Act No.57 of 2012. KCB Group Limited announced, in April 2015, its intention to incorporate a new wholly owned subsidiary, KCB Bank Kenya Limited, to which it would transfer its Kenyan banking business, assets and liabilities. The re-organisation converted KCB Group Limited into a non-trading holding company that owns both banking and non-banking subsidiary companies.

In 2016, KCB Group PLC was registered as a non-operating holding company to manage and oversee all KCB regional units in Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia. In 2019, KCB Group PLC acquired National Bank of Kenya.
