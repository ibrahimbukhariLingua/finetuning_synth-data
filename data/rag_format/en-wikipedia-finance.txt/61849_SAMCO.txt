## History

SAMCO Inc. was established in 1979 by its President and CEO, Osamu Tsuji, in a private garage in the Fushimi ward of Kyoto city. Initially called “SAMCO International, Inc.”, the company consisted of two engineers who developed a plasma CVD system for the deposition of amorphous silicon thin films used in solar cells. The name “SAMCO” is actually an acronym for “Semiconductor and Materials Company” and was chosen by Mr. Tsuji with a vision of making a breakthrough in semiconductor and materials research. By October 2012, SAMCO sales had accumulated to 3,000 units of semiconductor process equipment.
70% of SAMCO's revenue comes from the fields of optoelectronics (high-luminance LED and laser applications) and electronic components (power device and SAW device applications). The company is now beginning to focus its sales efforts towards MEMS applications as well as GaN and SiC based power device applications.
