## History

An initial architectural concept was developed in 2005, it envisioned a mixed use office and residential complex called *Capital Center*, consisting of a 3-story shopping mall, 22 story residential part and 45 story office building, which at 172 meters would have been the highest in Ukraine.

Construction began on December 22, 2006, by Russian company Mirax Group. The initial plan was changed into twin 46 story towers which were supposed to reach 192 meters, called **Mirax Plaza** Business Center and was initially expected to be completed by 2010. Construction was delayed due to the Great Recession. In May 2009, it was reported that Mirax Group had been in negotiations with another Russian corporation to sell the project. Some six months later, AEON Corporation acquired the share in the project and announced plans to correct the existing concept and commence construction in the autumn of 2010. By February 2010, only 11 floors of the first tower had been constructed.

In 2016, the abandoned construction site was taken over by the municipal company Kyivmiskbud due to growing debt. The project was scaled down to single tower, cut down to almost just half of the originally projected height, a mere 28 floors and six smaller buildings, ranging between 8 and 23 floors. The tower was topped out in 2020 and the entire complex was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022, but work has had been halted by the full-scale russian invasion ongoing since 24 February 2022.
