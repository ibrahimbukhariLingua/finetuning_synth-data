# Boasso Global



**Boasso Global**, formerly known as **Quality Distribution, Inc.** (**Quality**), is a Tampa, Florida-based ISO tank services provider. On August 18, 2015, Quality completed its previously announced merger agreement with funds advised by Apax Partners LLP on May 6, 2015. In 2021, Quality sold its Quality Carriers bulk liquid chemical truck transportation business to CSX Corporation and rebranded to Boasso Global. In October 2022, Apax Partners sold Boasso Global to KKR.


## History

Formerly known as MTL, Inc. the company was founded in 1984 and had its name changed to Quality Distribution, Inc. in 1999. By 2012 the company was managing a fleet of approximately 2,800 independently owned and operated tractors and 5,300 trailers, as well as affiliate and company owned terminals; it had about 850 employees and a market capitalization of about $250 million.


## Expansion

The company expanded through acquisition into a number of areas in 2012, including transporting oil and wastewater for energy companies. These acquisitions initially underperformed expectations, but a December 2013 article in Barron's noted that QD's core business of chemical transportation remained a market-share leader. Earlier in 2013, Apollo Global Management planned to divest its 17% stake in the company with a public offering.

As of August 28, 2015, Quality no longer trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol QLTY.
