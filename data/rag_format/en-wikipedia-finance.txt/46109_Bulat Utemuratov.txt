After Kazakhstan became an independent country in 1991, President Nursultan Nazarbayev selected Utemuratov to go to Vienna and find economic opportunities for the new republic. He helped broker Kazakhstan’s first line of credit with Bank Creditanstalt. In 1996 Utemuratov was appointed as ambassador to Switzerland, a position he held for three years.

From 2008 to 2013, Utemuratov, was described as an "adviser to the president" and held a role as a special representative to Kyrgyzstan.
This close relationship with Nazarbayev led to Utemuratov being given the nickname "the grey cardinal" in Kazakhstan. The Times quoted a spokeswoman for Utemuratov saying he: "is neither a middleman, nor proxy for President Nazarbayev" and that he had not profited from his relationship with the President.

### Glencore

In 2011, when Glencore the Swiss-based mining and commodities company, announced its initial public offering (IPO) in London, the company said that some of the proceeds would be used to buy back the Kazzinc Glencore's copper subsidiary shares held by Verny Capital. In 2012, Glencore bought the Kazzinc shares back from Verny Capital for $1.359 billion, including $400 million in cash and the rest in Glencore shares. In 2013, Glencore-controlled zinc producer Kazzinc, acquired the Vasilkovskoye gold mine in Kazakhstan from Verny Capital. As part of this transaction, Verny was given shares in Kazzinc, Kazakhstan.

In 2013, Glencore gave a loan to Astana Property Management (APM), a company owned by Bulat Utemuratov via Verny Capital. The loan was to finance APM's construction of the Talan Towers hotel and apartment complex in Astana, Kazakhstan. Glencore loaned a total of $237 million to the project but the miner was forced to write off $96.5 million in 2018 after reported poor performance. Since that transaction, Utemuratov and Glencore have done several other deals together.
In 2015, Glencore bought Utemuratov's Gulfstream private jet in an undisclosed transaction.

Utemuratov sold his Glencore shares in December 2021


### Freezing of assets

On 1 December 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported about the freezing of Utemuratov's assets including stakes in luxury hotels, cash in bank accounts in half a dozen countries and a Burger King franchise, by a UK civil court on the claim of BTA Bank. The freezing injunction of the English Court in relation to the assets of Bulat Utemuratov was lifted in December 2020 following a settlement between the two parties.

In March 2022, Dame Margaret Hodge, a British Member of Parliament, named Utemuratov in a speech advocating for sanctions against Kazakh billionaires. Utemuratov was one of 30 oligarchs and members of the Kazakh elite who, Hodge claimed, had benefited from their ties to the Nazarbayev regime. Hodge said: “Bulat Utemuratov is a former chief of staff to Nazarbayev.
