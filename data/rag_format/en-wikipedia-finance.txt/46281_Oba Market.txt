Oba Market


# Oba Market



The **Oba Market** (also referred to as Edo: **Eki-Oba**) is an open-air market situated at Ring Road in the center of Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. Its roots date back to the 15th century, making it one of the most historically significant markets in the region.


## History


### Establishment

The history of Oba Market reaches back to the 15th century when commerce thrived at this location. Over centuries, it has served as a pivotal trading center within the Benin Kingdom, evolving in tandem with the city.


### Role of Emotan

One prominent figure associated with Oba Market is Emotan, also known as *Uwarraye*. In the 15th century, during the reigns of Oba Uwaifiokun and Oba Ewuare the Great, Emotan was a respected market woman celebrated for her humanitarian work and dedication to children. Importantly, she played a key role during Prince Ogun's (Oba Ewuare I) quest to reclaim his throne after a period of exile.

Emotan and Prince Ogun conspired to overthrow the usurper, Oba Uwaifiokun. Emotan's astuteness played a crucial role in Prince Ogun's successful return to the throne. She provided sanctuary for him within her modest dwelling in Oba Market, becoming his trusted informant as Uwaifiokun sought to eliminate him to retain power.

Upon Emotan's passing, Oba Ewuare the Great decreed that she should be forever remembered. To honor this decree, he deified her by planting a sacred Uruhe tree at her resting place, which was the same location where she had resided adjacent to Oba Market.
