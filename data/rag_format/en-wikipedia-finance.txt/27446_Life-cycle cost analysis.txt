Life-cycle cost analysis


# Life-cycle cost analysis



**Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA)** is an economic analysis tool to determine the most cost-effective option to purchase, run, sustain or dispose of an object or process. The method is popular in helping managers determine economic sustainability by figuring out the life cycle of a product or process.


## Definition

The term is used in the study of Industrial ecology (IE). The purpose of IE is to help managers make informed decisions by tracking and analyzing products, resources and wastes.
