## Early life

In 1932 he was elected to an open seat on the Massachusetts Governor's Council. He was the first Jew elected to the body. During his tenure on the council, Grossman was a staunch opponent of Governor James Michael Curley. In 1938, Grossman announced that he was ending his reelection campaign to focus on his business. However, he left open the possibility of running "for a state-wide office" in the future. In 1962, Grossman ran for Massachusetts state treasurer. He defeated Francis Andrew Walsh in the Republican primary 71% to 29%, but lost in the general election to Democrat John T. Driscoll, 62% to 37%.
