## History


### Schurman Fine Papers

The company was founded in 1950 by Marcel and Margrit Schurman in their Berkeley, California kitchen. It was originally known as Schurman Fine Papers and operated as a wholesaler, importing fine art-inspired greeting cards, stationery, and other paper products from Europe. The Schurmans would sell the imported paper products to local gift and book shops. In its first year of operation, the company earned $20,000. It earned its first $1 million in 1961, and, by 1965, it had a warehouse and several employees.

In 1973, Margrit Schurman opened the first Papyrus retail store in Berkeley to exclusively sell the company's products. Over the next five years, the company opened more Papyrus retail stores across the United States and eventually opted to start selling franchises. In the 1980s, Schurman Fine Papers had salespeople and showrooms across the country and began pulling in around $10 million in annual revenue. In 1982, the Schurmans' youngest daughter and current CEO, Dominique Schurman, began working at the firm. In the 1980s, the company began domestic production of papyrus products.

Dominique Schurman became the company's vice president within a few years. When her father, Marcel, retired in 1991, Dominique took over as CEO. Her primary goal was to promote the Papyrus brand and continue to create in-house greeting cards. By 2005, Schurman had increased the number of Papyrus retail stores from 37 to 146.


### Schurman Retail Group

In 2009, Schurman Retail Group sold the Papyrus brand and wholesale division to American Greetings, while buying 341 American Greetings retail outlets. In addition to the American Greetings retail stores, Schurman Retail Group also acquired Carlton Cards outlets in Canada.

Following the American Greetings deal, the company began earning $200 million in annual revenue.

Due to trademark issues, Schurman Retail opened in the UK as Jolie Papier in 2014 with its first store at Bluewater Shopping Centre followed by a second location in Newcastle. In August 2017, American Greetings took back management of Clinton.

By November 2019, Schurman Retail Group was looking to get rent reductions from landlords and consider closing stores.
