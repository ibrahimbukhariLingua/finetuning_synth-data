# Kate Gordon (energy analyst)



**Kate Gordon** is an American lawyer, urban planner, non-profit advisor, and leader in the "green jobs" and climate risk movement. In 2021, she became Senior Advisor to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm at the United States Department of Energy. In 2019, she was appointed by Governor of California Gavin Newsom to lead the California Governor's Office of Planning and Research.

Before that appointment, Gordon served as an independent consultant and Senior Advisor at the Paulson Institute, where she provides strategic support on issues related to climate change and sustainable economic growth. She is also a nonresident Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal as one of the paper's “Energy Experts". She currently serves on the non-profit boards of Vote Solar, Center for Carbon Removal, and the American Jobs Project and writes a regular newsletter on clean energy and climate called "Kate's Cliffnotes"

Gordon is a nationally recognized expert on the intersection of clean energy and economic development. Before joining the Paulson Institute, she was the Founding Director of the "Risky Business Project]", co-chaired by NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, and business leader and philanthropist Tom Steyer, and focused on the economic risks the U.S. faces from unmitigated climate change. The project was founded in October 2013, when the three co-chairs founded a new initiative to assess and publicize the economic risks to the U.S. associated with climate change. The project grew out of concerns by the co-chairs that the U.S. was not developing sound risk assessments to respond to the impacts of a changing climate. In their development of this initiative, the three founders recruited additional members to forge the Project's Risk Committee, which expended to include corporate executives and senior government officials. Gordon took on this project in her role as Senior Vice President for Climate and Energy at Next Generation, a non-partisan think tank based in San Francisco, where she worked on California policy development as well as large-scale national communications and research projects.

Earlier in her career, Gordon served as Vice President of Energy and Environment at the Washington D.C.–based Center for American Progress, where she helped develop and author policy recommendations and Congressional testimony related to the cap and trade negotiations, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and American Reinvestment and Recovery Act implementation. Prior to CAP, Gordon was a senior associate at the Center on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS), and co-director of the national Apollo Alliance (currently part of the Blue Green Alliance). Before this, she was a consumer rights and employment litigator at the Public Justice Foundation.

Gordon received an undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University. Gordon earned a J.D. and master's degree in city planning from the University of California-Berkeley.


## Notable Public Appearances

* *Campaigns and Elections* magazine named Gordon one of the top fifty "Influencers to watch ahead of the 2014 election cycle."
* Gordon testified before Congress on October 28, 2009, regarding an energy and jobs bill.
* Gordon appeared on *The Rachel Maddow Show* in 2010 regarding the moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
* Gordon debated Andrew Morriss, one of the co-authors of *The False Promise of Green Energy*, at the Cato Institute on April 21, 2011. Morriss argued that having top-down governmental programs manage green energy and green jobs was a flawed concept, driven by misguided economic thinking and bad data. Gordon countered Morriss' assertions with arguments that the data actually shows otherwise: that government programs (versus free market, competitive forces) have generated new jobs and transformed existing jobs and economic forces.
* Gordon participated in an Intelligence Squared debate on March 8, 2016. Gordon and her partner Michael Lind, Co-Founder of the New America Foundation, debated Jack Abramoff, former lobbyist and author of Capitol Punishment, and Zephyr Teachout associate professor at Fordham Law and author of "Corruption in America". The resolution under debate was: "Eliminate Corporate Subsidies." Gordon and Lind won the debate by a large margin.
