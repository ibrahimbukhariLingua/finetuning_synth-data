Strategic Actions for a Just Economy


# Strategic Actions for a Just Economy



**Strategic Actions for a Just Economy** (SAJE) is a non-profit economic justice organization that advocates for tenant rights, healthy housing, and equitable development. It was founded in 1996 by Gilda Haas and Kent Wong and is currently led by Executive Director Cynthia Strathmann PhD. SAJE organizes working class communities in South Central Los Angeles through leadership development programs, tenant rights clinics, and job readiness training.


## Community Benefits Agreements

As a founding convening organization of the United Neighbors in Defense Against Displacement Coalition (UNIDAD)--formerly known as the Coalition for a Responsible USC and the Figueroa Corridor Coalition for Economic Justice--SAJE has fought for the adoption community benefits agreements (CBA) that ensure new developments benefit existing working-class residents in impacted neighborhoods. These agreements have included provisions for affordable housing funding, local targeted hiring, low-income health clinics, and set asides for low and extremely-low income housing.

**Notable projects with CBAs involving SAJE:**

* Staples Center/LA Live
* GH Palmer Lorenzo Project
* University of Southern California University Village
* Grand Metropolitan Development
