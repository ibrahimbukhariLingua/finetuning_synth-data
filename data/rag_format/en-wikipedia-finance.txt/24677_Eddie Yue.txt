**Eddie Yue Wai-man** (Chinese: 余偉文; born 21 September 1964) is the 3rd and current Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, having held the position since 1 October 2019.


## Education

Yue received a bachelor's degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a law degree and a master's degree from the University of London, and an MBA from Harvard Business School.


## Controversies

In September 2022, Yue said that when inviting executives to Hong Kong for the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in November 2022, "Nobody asked about quarantine restrictions [then], or any arrangements needed to come to Hong Kong." In contrast, earlier reports said that executives told the Hong Kong government they would be reluctant to travel if hotel quarantine was required, or if any other restrictions remained in place. Yue said that their attendance to the Summit was a vote of confidence for the city. On 27 October 2022, Yue said that he hoped the public would understand letting the guests to the Summit be exempt from normal COVID-19 restrictions, where other arrivals to Hong Kong cannot eat at restaurants in the first 3 days after landing in the city. Despite the COVID-19 exemptions for the guests, Yue said "Hong Kong is back."
