Sydenham Ward


# Sydenham Ward



**Sydenham** (commonly referred to as *Sydenham Ward*) is a central business district located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The Sydenham district for census purposes is bounded by Lake Ontario to the south and east, by Princess Street to the north and Barrie Street to the west. These boundaries do not coincide with the Sydenham Ward boundaries for city councillor elections as they include parts of the downtown main street.

The average family income for the area is $85,636 which is considerably higher than the city average. This is attributable to the neighbourhoods proximity to Queen's University. The Sydenham neighbourhood has a mix of business and retail uses on its east and north sides as it approaches Princess Street, which is Kingston's primary downtown business district. The majority of the neighbourhood however is a mix of permanent homes and rental accommodations for students. Many of Kingston's historic limestone structures can be found in the Sydenham neighbourhood.

The neighbourhood is home to Empire Life Financial's Canadian Headquarters at King & Johnson Streets and is one of Kingston's largest employers with 550 full-time employees
