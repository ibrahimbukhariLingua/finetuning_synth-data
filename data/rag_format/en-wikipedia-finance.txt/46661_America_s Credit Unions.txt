America's Credit Unions


# America's Credit Unions



**America's Credit Unions** is a national trade association for both state- and federally chartered credit unions located in the United States. It was launched in 2024 as part of the merger between the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) and the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU). Once fully operational in 2025, America's Credit Unions will provide its member credit unions with trade association services, such as lobbying, regulatory advocacy, professional development, and professional services management. The organization is headquartered in Washington, D.C.


## History

On August 1, 2023, the CUNA and NAFCU boards of directors announced their intent to merge, forming a new entity called America's Credit Unions. The merger was approved by CUNA and NAFCU members and became effective on January 1, 2024, when CUNA and longtime CUNA CEO Jim Nussle is the president and CEO of the new association.

CUNA and NAFCU will continue to operate as distinct organizations under the America's Credit Unions brand while they combine their operations throughout 2024. In March 2024, the organization announced plans to lay off about a quarter of CUNA's Madison, Wisconsin-based workforce.
