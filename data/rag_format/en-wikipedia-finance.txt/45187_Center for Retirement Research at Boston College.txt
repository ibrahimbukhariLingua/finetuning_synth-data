# Center for Retirement Research at Boston College



The **Center for Retirement Research at Boston College** (CRR) was established in 1998 as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC). In 2018, the CRR received renewed support from the U.S. Social Security Administration under the Retirement and Disability Research Consortium (RDRC). The RDRC includes parallel centers at the National Bureau of Economic Research., the University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The center is a non-profit research institute, affiliated with the Carroll School of Management at Boston College. All of the CRR's research and publications are available to the public on its website.

The center sponsors multiple research projects and disseminates the findings, trains new scholars, and provides access to data on retirement.
