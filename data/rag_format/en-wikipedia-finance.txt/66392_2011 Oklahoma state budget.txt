2011 Oklahoma state budget


# 2011 Oklahoma state budget



The **Oklahoma State Budget for Fiscal Year 2011**, is a spending request by Governor Brad Henry to fund government operations for July 1, 2010–June 30, 2011. Governor Henry and legislative leader approved the budget in May 2010. This was Governor Henry's eight and final budget submitted as governor.

Figures shown in the spending request do not reflect the actual appropriations for Fiscal Year 2011, which must be authorized by the Legislature.


## Overview

Oklahoma's $6.7 billion state budget for FY2011 was approved in May 2010 and is $400 million less than the previous budget. State revenues declined almost 17% in FY2010, down approximately $945 million from FY2009. As a result, lawmakers cut state agency budgets 7.5% midway through FY2010. Then lawmakers relied on a combination of fee hikes, deferred tax credits and further cuts to state agencies (3% cut in general) to help balance the FY2011 budget. That was not, however, enough and lawmakers additionally relied on $500 million in federal stimulus money and $277 million in funds from the Constitutional Reserve Fund to balance the FY2011 state budget.

Oklahoma has nearly $600 million remaining in its Constitutional Reserve Fund, but has limitations in using it to fill the budget shortfall. Three-eighths of the fund may be used to fill the 2010 mid-year gap, three-eighths may be used for the next fiscal year, and the remaining quarter may be used in a declared emergency by the governor with a three-quarter vote of the Legislature.
