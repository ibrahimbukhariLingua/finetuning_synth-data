## Early life and family

Anderson was born in Wellington, and was educated at Christ's College and Victoria University of Wellington. He married Carol Tuck in 1970, and they had three children.


## Business career

He began his career in accounting, followed by sharebroking in Melbourne. He returned to New Zealand in 1972 to help form the merchant bank South Pacific Merchant Finance (Southpac). He became Chief Executive of Southpac in 1979 and within a year of Southpac merging with the National Bank of New Zealand in 1988, he became Chief Executive of the National Bank. Anderson oversaw the National Bank's merger with Rural Bank in 1992 and Countrywide Bank in 1998. In 2004 Lloyds TSB sold The National Bank to the ANZ bank. After ANZ's acquisition of the National Bank he was responsible for ANZ's New Zealand businesses until his retirement at the end of 2005.

In December 2007 he was appointed by the New Zealand government to be the chairman of the Capital and Coast District Health Board, responsible for medical services in the Wellington and Kapiti Coast, after a series of significant financial and operational problems. In February 2008 he was appointed commissioner of the Hawke's Bay District Health Board after Health Minister, David Cunliffe, sacked the DHB board due to the minister's dissatisfaction with their running of the DHB. After the change of government following the 2008 general election, the new Health Minister, Tony Ryall, reinstated the board of Hawke's Bay DHB that had been elected in 2007 and appointed Anderson as the board's chairman.
