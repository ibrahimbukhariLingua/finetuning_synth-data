David and Simon Reuben


# David and Simon Reuben



**David Reuben** (born 1941) and **Simon Reuben** (born 1944) are British businessmen. In 2024, they were named the third-richest family in the UK by the *Sunday Times Rich List*, with a net worth of £24.9 billion.


## Early life and background

The brothers were born in Bombay, British India, the sons of David Sassoon Reuben and Nancy Reuben, a Baghdadi Jewish family. Their father went to Bombay from Iraq to secure work in the textile industry. Following their parents' separation, the brothers moved to London in the 1950s with their mother, and due to the change in financial circumstances, the brothers attended state schools and lived in Islington, North London, with Simon never completing his formal education.


## Careers

David joined a scrap metals business while Simon started out in carpets. Simon went on to buy out England's oldest carpet company from the receivers and made enough money from it to start investing in property, with early investments on Walton Street and the King's Road in Chelsea. The brothers increased their wealth during the 1970s and 1980s in metals and property trading.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Metals business

In the early 1990s, the brothers invested in the Russian metals market. When Russian aluminum smelters were incapacitated by debt, Reuben's company Trans-World entered into tolling arrangements with factories in which they paid for and delivered raw materials in return for finished aluminum, which it then sold for profit. The company's investment in Russia was US$1.5 billion (£870 million), with global sales in 1995 above US$8 billion. TransWorld was accused of involvement in illegal activities, including several murders. The brothers were involved with several members of the country's new oligarchy, including Roman Abramovich. They settled a multimillion-pound legal dispute with Oleg Deripaska with a settlement being awarded to Reuben Brothers.

In 1997, Russia's Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov linked both the Cherney brothers and Reuben brothers to the Izmaylovskaya mafia led by Anton Malevsky in Israel. In March 1998, Boris Yeltsin replaced Kulikov as minister.

In 2008, the Reuben brothers returned to the commodity business, expanding their mining interests with a portfolio of mines in Morocco, Indonesia, and South Africa.ᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ

##### Takeover of Newcastle United

On 14 April 2020, it emerged that a deal to transfer ownership of Newcastle United Football Club had been agreed between incumbent owner Mike Ashley and a prospective buying consortium consisting of Reuben Brothers, Amanda Staveley's PCP Capital Partners, and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. The Premier League initially refused to ratify the deal, and Mike Ashley engaged in legal proceedings against the Premier League to complete the takeover. On 7 October 2021, the Premier League approved the buy-out, stating that it has "received legally binding guarantees that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control the Newcastle United club". The buy-out deal involved the Saudi Public Investment Fund taking up 80% of Newcastle United shares, while the Reuben Brothers and PCP Capital Partners each took 10% of the remaining shares.

#### Entertainment

On 19 August 2024, Reuben Brothers acquired a strategic stake in EDGLRD, an entertainment company founded by filmmaker Harmony Korine.


## Controversial statement by London mayor

In 2006 Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London at the time, used a press conference to accuse Simon and David Reuben of jeopardising the £4 billion Olympic City development, in which the Reuben brothers held a 50% stake. Livingstone controversially told the media conference, referring to the Reuben brothers, that "If they're not happy here, they can go back to Iran and try their luck with the ayatollahs, if they don't like the planning regime or my approach." Conservative members of the London Assembly stated the brothers were not Iranian, but had been born in British India of Iraqi-Jewish parents. After a public complaint and a subsequent official investigation into Livingstone's comments, the investigating officer dismissed the complaint and concluded that Livingstone had reason to be strongly critical of the Reuben brothers' conduct, and that his criticism, while "robust," was "reasonable" in the circumstances.


## The Reuben Foundation

The family's philanthropic vehicle, the Reuben Foundation, is focused on the advancement of healthcare and education.

The family founded the **Nancy Reuben Primary School**, an independent Jewish day school in Hendon in honour of their mother.

The foundation has donated £80 million to support the creation of Reuben College, Oxford, originally named Parks College. It is a post-graduate college focused on climate change, artificial intelligence and cellular life.


## Personal life

According to the *Sunday Times Rich List* 2023, David and Simon Reuben and their combined family had an estimated net worth of £24.4 billion. This made them Britain's fourth wealthiest family.

*The Times* has reported that the brothers' businesses make extensive use of offshore tax havens. A spokesperson said that their businesses "fully comply with UK tax laws".

The brothers are donors to the Conservative Party.
