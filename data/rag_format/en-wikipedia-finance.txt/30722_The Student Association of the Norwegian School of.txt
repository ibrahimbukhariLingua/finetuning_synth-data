The Student Association of the Norwegian School of Economics


# The Student Association of the Norwegian School of Economics



**Student Association of the Norwegian School of Economics** (Norwegian: *Norges Handelshøyskoles Studentforening*) or **NHHS** is the student union of the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) in Bergen, Norway. All students at the school are members of NHHS, which is divided into 28 groups with another 37 associated groups.

The student union is among the most active in the country, and also among the wealthiest. The most prominent activities are the two biannual events UKEN, a festival, and NHH Symposiet, a business conference. Both provide large revenue that finance the rest of the student activities, even though Uken in 2006 lost largest sums of money. It also publishes the biweekly newspaper *K7 Bulletin*. NHHS is led by an executive board with eight members.
