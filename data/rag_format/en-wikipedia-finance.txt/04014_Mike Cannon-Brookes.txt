## Early life and education

Michael Cannon-Brookes was born on 17 November 1979 in Connecticut, US. The son of a global banking executive, also named Mike, and his wife Helen, he is the youngest of three siblings, with two sisters. His family relocated to Taiwan when he was six months old, and to Hong Kong when he was three; he later attended boarding school in England. He attended Cranbrook School in Sydney, and graduated from the University of New South Wales with a bachelor's degree in information systems on a UNSW co-op scholarship.


## Career

Before founding Atlassian, Cannon-Brookes co-founded an internet bookmark management tool called The Bookmark Box with his university classmate Niki Scevak. The Bookmark Box was sold to Blink.com in 2000.

Cannon-Brookes co-founded Atlassian, a collaboration software company, of which he is co-CEO, with Scott Farquhar. The pair started the company in 2002, shortly after graduating from university, funding it with credit cards. They have said they founded Atlassian with the aim of earning the then-typical graduate starting salary of A$48,000 at the big corporations without having to work for someone else.

Their first major Atlassian product was Jira, an issue- and project-tracking software. They decided to forgo the expense of hiring sales people, and instead spent their time and money on building a good product and selling it at a more affordable price via the Atlassian website. As of 2016, the company still did not have a traditional sales force, investing instead in research and development.

In 2005, they opened an office in New York, where most of their clients were. Later in 2005 they moved the U.S. office to San Francisco, which had a much larger pool of relevant technical talent.

Their first external funding for Atlassian was a US$60 million round from Accel in 2010. In 2014, they redomiciled the company to the UK, in advance of an initial public offering (IPO).

Atlassian made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange in December 2015, with a market capitalisation of $4.37 billion. The IPO made Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar Australia's first tech startup billionaires and household names in Australia.

Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar redomiciled Atlassian to the United States in 2022. Since September 2024, Cannon-Brookes is the sole CEO of the company after Farquhar stepped down as co-CEO. As of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, he owns approximately 20% of Atlassian, with super-voting shares.


## Other activities

Cannon-Brookes started Grok Ventures in 2016 as a family office. He is a major investor in green projects through his private investing vehicle. In October 2021, he pledged to donate and invest $1.5 billion on climate projects by 2030 to reinforce the COP26 goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. He also formed a climate fund called Boundless Earth in 2022.

Cannon-Brookes is an adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales' School of Computer Science and Engineering. He is also the chairman of Blackbird Ventures, a venture capital firm.

In September 2020, it was revealed that Cannon-Brookes was among 35,000 Australians on a Chinese Government "Overseas Key Individuals Database" of prominent international individuals of interest for China.

In March 2022, Cannon-Brookes and the billionaire Andrew Forrest invested in the Sun Cable project, to build a solar and battery farm 12,000 hectares (120 km²) in size at Powell Creek, Northern Territory, and a power-cable to link it to Singapore (via Indonesia) leaving Australia at Murrumujuk beach. In January 2023, Sun Cable went into administration owing to disagreements between Cannon-Brookes and Forrest, and in May 2023, Grok Ventures outbid Forrest and others to buy the liquidated company.

In 2022, Cannon-Brookes became the largest shareholder of the Australian publicly listed energy company AGL, Australia's largest greenhouse gas emitter, in a move to force the company to de-carbonise more quickly.
