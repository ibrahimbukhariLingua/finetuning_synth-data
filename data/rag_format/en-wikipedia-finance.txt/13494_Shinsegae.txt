Shinsegae


# Shinsegae



**Shinsegae Inc.** (Korean: 신세계; Hanja: 新世界; lit. new world, KRX: 004170) is a South Korean department store franchise, along with several other businesses, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. The firm is an affiliate of Shinsegae Group, South Korea's leading retail *chaebol*, and one of the big three department store firms in Korea, along with Lotte and Hyundai Department Store. Its flagship store in Centum City, Busan, was the world's largest department store at 3,163,000 square feet (293,900 m²), surpassing Macy's flagship Herald Square in New York City in 2009.

Shinsegae was the first credit card company in South Korea. They issued their own charge card from 1967 to 2000. In 2000, Shinsegae sold their credit card division to KorAm Bank, which was later acquired by Citibank Korea.

Shinsegae was originally part of the Samsung Group, from which it separated in the 1990s along with CJ Group (Food/Chemicals/Entertainment), Saehan Group (Electronic Media/Apparel/Textiles), and the Hansol Group (Paper/Telecom). Chairwoman Lee Myung-hee is the fifth daughter of Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul and the aunt of Lee Jae-yong, the executive chairman of Samsung Electronics.

The group owns the brands Shinsegae and E-Mart, and is in direct competition with Lotte Shopping and Hyundai Department Store Group.


## History

The main branch of Shinsegae is the oldest department store in Korea. It was opened in 1930 as the Gyeongseong branch of Mitsukoshi, a Japanese department store franchise; Korea was occupied by the Japanese Empire at the time. The store was acquired in 1945 by the late founder of Samsung group, Lee Byung-chull, and renamed Donghwa Department Store. After the Korean War (1950–1953) began, it was used for several years as a post exchange by the American army. In 1963, the store was given the name Shinsegae. The old building is currently used as a luxury shopping venue.

In 2021, Shinsegae bought the then-named SK Wyverns of the KBO League from SK and renamed then the SSG Landers. They bought them for 135.2 billion won, (100 billion for the team itself, and 35.2 billion for the team's facilities and properties) equivalent to $112.8 million.

Shinsegae Group will split its department store and supermarket divisions into two separate entities, the retail giant said 30 Oct 2024.


## Daejeon Shinsegae Art & Science (대전신세계 Art & Science)

The Daejeon store opened in 2021 is rather unique as it is a combination of department store, to a limited extent a shopping center, together with an art and science-oriented cultural facilities, a hotel and office space.

The 284,224 m² (3,059,360 sq ft), complex, costing 600 billion won (500,000,000 USD), consists of **Podium** department store area, and **EXPO Tower**. 88,572 m² (953,380 sq ft) are dedicated to department store sales area.


### Podium

**Podium** includes:

* Food Hall in the basement
* Main floor (62,500 sq ft (5,810 m²)) housing luxury accessory brands including Fendi, Bottega Veneta, and Saint Laurent as well as jewelry and over 40 beauty brands like Gucci Beauty and Clé de Peau Beauté. According to Jeffrey Hutchison & Associates, the designers, the vision was to create a "Grand Hall inspired by an early modern Italian villa in the spirit of such great Italian architects like Luigi Moretti and Carlo Scarpa" by reinterpreting classic design elements such as vaulted ceilings using bone-white plaster and custom decorative light pendants highlighting the circulation paths. The flooring "reimagines" an Italianate mosaic floor but with a contemporary pattern using contra black and Veneto white marble slabs.
* Second Floor (57,000 sq ft (5,300 m²)), selling men's and women's luxury brand fashions, also designed by Hutchison, with the theme "A Contemporary Sculpture Park", inspired by the sculptural works of Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, and the cubist works of Georges Braque. The women's area features Nairobi black marble on the floor, bone-white hand plaster sculptural elements on the walls, ceilings, and exaggerated columns to provide an "intimate yet inviting" environment. The men's area was designed to feel "sculptural", "masculine" and contemporary with blonde oak wood walls, a dimensional ceiling, and sequoia brown marble tiles on the floor, accenting asymmetrical patterns of the space.
* Third floor, fashions; Fourth floor: sports, golf, and outdoor; underwear; children's;
* Fifth floor, Verona Street food hall themed as a street in Verona, Italy

### EXPO Tower

The **EXPO Tower** building, 43 stories and 193 meters high, includes:

 + **Daejeon Expo Aquarium**, a media art combined aquarium, featuring a 4,200-metric-ton tank filled with approx. 20,000 fish of 250 different species. It combines multimedia art based on the theme of Poseidon, the god of the sea in Greek mythology.

**E-Mart** (Korean: 이마트) is a subsidiary of Shinsegae and a large discount store chain founded in South Korea, having stores in China, Korea and Mongolia. Domestically, E-Mart is the biggest discount store chain followed by Home Plus, and Lotte Mart.

In late May 2006, Shinsegae revealed plans to buy all 16 of the Wal-Mart stores in Korea. All of the country's Wal-Mart outlets were re-branded as E-Mart in October 2006. Wal-Mart exited the Korean market soon after.

Shinsegae spun off its E-Mart department into a separate corporation (KRX: 139480) in 2012. The shopping mall was acquired by E-Mart in January 2014.
