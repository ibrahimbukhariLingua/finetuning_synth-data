## Career

Al Maktoum's career in the aviation industry began in 1985 when he was appointed president of the Dubai Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) (the governing body which oversaw the activities of Dubai International and Dubai Duty Free). Emirates, the national carrier, was launched at the same time, with Al Maktoum appointed chairman.

He is believed to be connected to at least 14 board members in 14 organizations in 14 industries. Al Maktoum has been called "the man who put Dubai on the global aviation map." He has been chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline & Group since 1985. In October 2019 Al Maktoum, as president of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA), opened a quartet of sector-specific global food trade platforms at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC).

Al Maktoum was chairman of the Dubai Free Zone Council. At its 13th meeting in 2019, chaired by Al Maktoum, the members discussed initiatives and proposals for long-term rental agreements or investors and free zone passports. Al Maktoum is chair of the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature.


## Personal life

In 2007, he married Egyptian socialite Nivin El-Gamal in 2007 in an Islamic ceremony in a London flat. Al Maktoum denied that this had taken place; a London court accepted that it had, but that it was not a valid marriage under English law. She gave birth to their only child, Saeed bin Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum. Al Maktoum later married Sheikha Mona, a first cousin twice removed (a regional tradition), a daughter of Sheikh Obaid bin Thani Al Maktoum, in 2008.
