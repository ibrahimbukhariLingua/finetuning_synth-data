He claims that America's foreign policy exploits are tantamount to the establishment of an empire, and that the cost of maintaining such an empire could accelerate America's eventual decline.

Bonner warned in 2015 that the credit system, which has been the essential basis of the US economy since the 1950s, will inevitably fail, leading to catastrophic failure of the banking system.
