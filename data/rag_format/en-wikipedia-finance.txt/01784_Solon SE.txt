## Activities in the United States

SOLON Corporation, a fully owned subsidiary of Solon SE for the North American market, has been producing solar panels at its plant in Tucson, Arizona since October 2007. Initially the panels were for its own project to supply electricity to Pima County and for export back to Europe.

In December 2008, the world's largest CIGS thin-film solar array went live in Tucson. SOLON Corporation produced and installed the photovoltaic modules and designed the array.

Since an agreement with American Solar Electric, in January 2009 the company started to expand to the residential market in Arizona.
