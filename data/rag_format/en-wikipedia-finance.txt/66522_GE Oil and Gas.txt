This collaboration has included two Open Innovation Challenges that invited businesses, institutions and individuals to develop potential solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ to make energy production more sustainable. The first Open Innovation Challenge was issued in January 2015 and required entrants to find ways to reduce the amount of sand needed on oil wells. Over 100 submissions were received from applicants in more than 30 countries. Technical experts and management from Statoil and GE Oil & Gas served as judges. The winners were announced in July 2015 and were awarded an initial cash prize of US$25,000, with the potential to receive additional funding from a discretionary prize pool of US$375,000 for potential development or commercialization upon meeting certain additional conditions.

The second Open Innovation Challenge was issued in July 2015 and asked entrants to find solutions for reducing fresh water usage and improving water treatment in the development of onshore unconventional oil and gas reservoirs. The winners were announced in February 2016 and received the same prize.
