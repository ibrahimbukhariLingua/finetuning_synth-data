**Adzuna** is a search engine for job advertisements.

Like other job search engines, Adzuna gathers and displays vacancies from large job boards, specialized job portals and employer websites into a single database.

In September 2017, Adzuna announced the relaunch of improved 'ValueMyCV'.

In June 2023, Adzuna launched AI interview tool "Prepper" in the US and UK.


## History

Adzuna was founded in 2011 by Andrew Hunter, former head of marketing of Gumtree and VP of marketing at Qype, and Doug Monro, former MD of Gumtree and COO of Zoopla.

The beta site was launched in April 2011 with £300,000 seed investment from Passion Capital and Angel Investors, followed by a public press launch in July 2011.

In January 2012, Adzuna announced further investment of £500,000 from Index Ventures and The Accelerator Group to expand into other verticals and countries.

In June 2022, Adzuna announced they had acquired Getwork for an undisclosed amount.


## Other usages

The large database of job ads collated by the service has allowed the company to produce a number of statistics about trends in the employment market.

In November 2012, it was reported that Adzuna's job and housing market data was being supplied to the "Number 10 Dashboard", an app built by the UK's Government Digital Service to keep Prime Minister David Cameron and others up to date on key economic indicators.

In 2018, Adzuna was reported to have won a UK government contract to provide the Department for Work and Pensions' Find a Job service.
