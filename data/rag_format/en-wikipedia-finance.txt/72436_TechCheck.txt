# TechCheck



***TechCheck*** was an American business news program that airs on CNBC from 11:00 a.m to 12:00 p.m Eastern Time. It premiered on April 12, 2021. It is broadcast live Monday through Friday from a trading-floor set inside Post 9 at the New York Stock Exchange, which is shared with *Squawk on the Street* and *Closing Bell*, and from CNBC's studios in San Francisco. The final episode aired on February 17, 2023.


## History

In February 2021, CNBC announced it would replace *Squawk Alley* with a new hour-long program called *TechCheck*. It would retain the hour's focus on technology and continue to examine both prominent names as well as emerging public companies in the field, but also broaden its scope to cover changes in different sectors including energy, gaming, transportation, and media. Originally set to air on April 5, 2021, the program's premiere was postponed by one week to April 12.

*TechCheck* aired its last show on February 17, 2023 and was replaced by a third hour of *Squawk on the Street* although the name lives on as a brief segment aired towards the end of the final hour of *Squawk on the Street*.
