Eisenberg began his career as a consultant for Marttila and Kiley, Inc. a political consulting firm. In 1995, Eisenberg was appointed Montgomery Securities Investment Bank representative in Israel. That year, he also began working as VP Investment Banking at Jerusalem Global Investment Bank in partnership with Shlomo Kalish. Eisenberg's first investment was in PictureVision, a photo-sharing company, which was acquired by Kodak in the late 1990s.

Between 1997 and 2005, Eisenberg was a partner in Israel Seed Partners, an Israeli venture capital fund. His investments included Shopping.com, which went public in 2004, and was later acquired by eBay,Finjan Holdings, GuruNet and answers.com. Shopping.com reached a market cap of $810 million after its first day of trading, while GuruNet reached a market cap of $11 million on its first day.

In 2005, Eisenberg joined Benchmark Capital as managing Partner and was appointed its representative in Israel. His investments at Benchmark included Gigya, acquired in 2017 by SAP, Conduit, and Seeking Alpha. Eisenberg also led the investment in the website development platform Wix.com and WeWork.

In 2013, he co-founded Aleph, a venture capital fund based in Tel Aviv, together with Eden Shochat. Aleph is an early-stage fund with $850M under management focused on partnering with Israeli entrepreneurs to build large and impactful global brands. Since its founding, Aleph has invested in over 50 companies, including Melio, Lemonade Frank (acquired in 2021 by JP Morgan, and as of July 2023, embroiled in a lawsuit over falsified company performance data), Freightos, Bringg, JoyTunes, Healthy.io, Fabric, Windward, Honeybook and Nexar.

The fund has seven exits to date, among them four M&A transactions and two public offerings. Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) once neared a market cap of $13 billion in early 2021, but now worth only $1.15 billion as of Q2 2023, while Windward, WeWork (NYSE: WE), and Freightos (NYSE: CRGO) went public through a SPAC. Market performance of these exits has been poor. Freightos and Windward both lost over 65% of their market value since public debut (as of July 2023) and WeWork famously imploded, losing 98% of its value over a 5-year period ending in Q2 2023.

In April 2016, Aaron Rosenson, formerly of Insight Venture Partners, joined the fund as a third partner, immigrating to Israel from New York to assume his new role. In September of that year, Aleph raised $180 million for its second fund. In December 2019, Aleph launched a $200 million third fund. Aleph now has five partners, including Yael Elad, who became operating partner in 2019, and Tomer Diari, formerly of Bessemer Venture Partners, who joined in February 2021.

In December 2021, Aleph launched its fourth VC fund amounting to $300 million.

In April 2023, Charlie Javice, the founder of Frank, an Aleph investment prior to Frank's sale, was arrested for artificially inflating her company's user numbers before selling it to JPMorgan Chase for $175 million. Forbes reached out to Eisenberg in January when JP Morgan sued Javice, but Forbes reported that Eisenberg, had no comment.

## Views and opinions

Eisenberg credits Rabbi Yehuda Amital, one of the heads of Yeshivat Har Etzion, for giving him direction and providing the inspiration for his life's work. In answer to Eisenberg's question about the mitzvah of where to live in the Land of Israel, Rabbi Amital said: "It's all nonsense – set up a factory to employ 10,000 people so they can earn an honest and decent living. That is the biggest mitzvah."

Analyzing the Israeli start-up industry and the phenomenon of early exits, Eisenberg offers a psychological hypothesis: "This is a country where people want to be their own boss ... There is less of an appreciation of the impact of the size of the overall pie versus my piece of the pie". He believes that Israeli companies need to aim for bigger outcomes, such as attempting initial public offerings and SPACs, while keeping their headquarters in Israel.

Eisenberg describes himself as a "Herzlean" — a follower of Theodor Herzl's belief in civic movements.
