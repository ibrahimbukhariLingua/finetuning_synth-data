Clydebank Co-operative Society


# Clydebank Co-operative Society



The **Clydebank Co-operative Society Limited** is the smallest consumers' co-operative in Scotland, based in the town of Clydebank near Glasgow. Along with Scotmid and The Co-operative Group, it is one of three consumer co-operative retail societies in Scotland, and the only one not merged into a regional or national society.

Unusually for co-operatives in the United Kingdom, it is not a member of Co-operatives UK. However, in its founding year of 1881, it joined the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society. Before the second world war, community leader Jenny Hyslop was one of the society's organisers.

Until 2013, Clydebank Co-op had buying arrangements with the Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG), a buying group managed by The Co-operative Group, the successor of SCWS, which also manages The Co-operative brand.

In 2013/2014, Clydebank Co-op left the CRTG, agreeing to buy from local wholesaler JW Filshill, and co-brand its six stores with Filshill's KeyStore brand.


## Stores

As of 2015ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the society operates seven food stores ranging from just over 6,500 square feet at Dunn Street, to its smallest, 1,800 square feet (170 m²), at Great Western Road & Sylvania Way South, Clydebank

* Great Western Road, Knightswood
* Faifley Road, Faifley
* Sylvania Way South, Clydebank
* Kilbowie Road, Clydebank

In 2014, it closed its Hardgate food store, reducing the number of its food stores from seven to six. The Hardgate store later reopened as a Co-op/KeyStore More and continues to trade.
