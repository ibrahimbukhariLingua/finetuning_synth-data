# List of airline holding companies



This is a **list of airline holding companies**, that either own more than one airline or are the parent company of a single airline.

A company or firm in which the holding company owns a significant portion of voting shares, usually 20â€“50% or a "minority of share ownership", is known as an associate company. A company in which the holding company owns more than 50% voting shares or a "majority of share ownership" is known as a subsidiary. The holding company thus can also be referred to as the parent company at that stage.
