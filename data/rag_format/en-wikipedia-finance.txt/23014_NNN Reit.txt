## History

The company was formed in 1984 as Golden Corral Realty Corp. as a way for the owners of the Golden Corral restaurant chain to allow employees to invest in the company.

In 1993, the company split from Golden Corral, and changed its name to Commercial Net Lease Realty. The company also moved its listing to the New York Stock Exchange.

On January 1, 1998, the company merged with its former external adviser, CNL Realty Advisor Inc., and became a self-advised, self-managed REIT.

In February 2004, Craig Macnab was named chief executive officer of the company. In May 2004, he was also named president.

In 2005, the company acquired National Properties Corporation for $61 million.

In May 2006, the company changed its name to National Retail Properties, Inc.

In 2015, the company acquired 19 Frisch's restaurants in the Cincinnati, Ohio area for $47 million in a leaseback transaction. This led to the destruction of the historic Cincinnati restaurant chain after the locations were shuttered permanently due to an inability to pay the rising rent. As a result, there is a strong distaste for NNN Reit in the Cincinnati area

In April 2017, Craig Macnab retired and Jay Whitehurst became CEO & President of the company.
