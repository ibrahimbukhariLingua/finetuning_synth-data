## History

Stratton Finance was first established by Rob Chaloner in 1998 as a specialist motor finance broker. The business initially relied on referrals from a Melbourne-based Land Rover dealership, but rapidly began attracting word of mouth referrals and a number of finance consultants were employed to meet the growing demand.

In 2002, Stratton Finance launched www.strattonfinance.com.au, and in 2009 launched the first Stratton Finance franchise. In 2014, Stratton Finance became part of the Carsales network when Carsales.com Ltd bought a 50.1% share in the business. In 2015, Stratton Finance acquired All About Finance, which became its marine & leisure division. In 2019 Carsales announced its intended divestment of the business, and in 2020, a team led by Founder Rob Chaloner acquired Carsales Ltd's shareholding.

Stratton Finance was announced best loan provider and car loan provider for 2023, achieving the honor three years in a row, and establishing the business as one of the leading car and asset brokers in Australia.
