# List of companies of Armenia

 

Armenia is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia, on the Armenian Highland, it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.

The economy of Armenia benefits strongly from investment and support of Armenians abroad.

Before independence, Armenia's economy was largely industry-based – chemicals, electronics, machinery, processed food, synthetic rubber, and textile – and highly dependent on outside resources. The republic had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy.

As of January 2019, there are about 40 thousand registered companies with payroll positions. There are 247 companies with over 250 registered employees. The average wage in these companies amounts to 240 thousand AMD.
