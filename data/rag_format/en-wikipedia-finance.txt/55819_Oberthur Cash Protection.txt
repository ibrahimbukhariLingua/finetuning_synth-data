## History

In 1983 Oberthur Cash Protection (operating as Axytrans, part of Axytel - a company specialized in the design and manufacture of credit cards and checks) invented the first Intelligent Banknote Neutralization System to protect Cash-in-transit using ink as a degradation agent. The invention was made in collaboration with one of Axytrans' customers, a French Cash-in-transit company VALTIS, who was searching for alternative way to protect valuables during Cash-in-transit The product, called ATV (Axytrans Transport de Valeurs) was first used in 1990 by the Belgium Post for their Cash-in-transit operation. In 1991 French law was modified to allow use of ATV on an experimental basis and the French CIT company VALTIS started using it to service three regional banks.

In 1990 the post of Belgium officially addressed Oberthur Cash Protection over the Belgian Ministry of Interior for the implementation of IBNS for the transport of cash in unarmored vehicles. In 1991 the French CIT company VALTIS started using the ATV to service three regional banks.

In 1993 Axytrans was purchased by Group François-Charles Oberthur.

In 2003 the firm introduced its first Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation System to protect cash inside of the ATM.

In 2007 the firm acquired Fluiditi, a part of the NCR group, specializing in ATM cash protection and changed its name to Oberthur Cash Protection.

In 2011 the Card Systems and Identity Division of Oberthur Technologies was bought out by Advent International. The Secure Printing Division and Cash Protection are renamed Oberthur Fiduciaire and remained under the Savare family control.
