Business Intelligence Competency Center


# Business Intelligence Competency Center



A **Business Intelligence Competency Center** (BICC) is a cross-functional organizational team with defined tasks, roles, responsibilities, and processes for supporting and promoting the effective use of business intelligence (BI) across an organization.

Since 2001, the BICC concept has been refined through practical implementations in organizations that have implemented BI and related analytical software.

In practice, the term "BICC" is not well integrated into business or public sector organizations and there are large variations in the organizational design for BICCs. Nevertheless, the popularity of the BICC concept has resulted in the creation of units within organizations that focus on the use of BI software for decision-making, thereby increasing that organizations return on investment (ROI) of BI.

A BICC coordinates the activities and resources to ensure that a fact-based approach to decision making is systematically implemented throughout an organization. It has responsibility for the governance structure for BI and the use of analytical programs, projects, practices, software, and architecture. The BICC is responsible for building the plans, priorities, infrastructure, and competencies that the organization needs to take forward-looking strategic decisions by using the BI and analytical software capabilities.


## Analytics Competency Center (ACC)

In recent years knowledge-oriented shared service centers have emerged in many organizations. Their primary focus has been the offering of analytics and data mining as an internal service across the organization. These centres are often referred to as Analytics Competency Center (ACC), or Analytics Center of Excellence; Analytics Service Center; Big Data CoC; or Big Data Lab.

By the end of 2017 it is observed that approximately 25% of all large firms have a dedicated ACC unit (or equivalent) for data and analytics. In contrast to classic BICC these centers do not place emphasis on reporting, historical analysis and dashboards. ACCs follow the strategic objective of transforming a company towards a data focus, building expertise in data analytics, formulating a data strategy, identifying use cases for data mining, and drive the general adoption of analytics across the organization. BICCs may be transformed into an ACC, but new formations of ACC can also be found in practice.
