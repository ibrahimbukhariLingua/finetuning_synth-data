# Surplus Record Machinery & Equipment Directory



**Surplus Record** is a business directory of surplus, new, and used machine tools, machinery, and industrial equipment in the United States. It was founded in 1924 by Thomas P. Scanlan.

The monthly directory, which is hundreds of pages long, has been referred to as "the bible of the used and surplus capital equipment industry". Postings were included online in the 1980s and online auctions started in 1999. A year later, in April 2000, FreeMarkets Inc., a business-to-business online marketplace, announced that it completed the acquisition of iMark.com Inc. including assets of Surplus Record Inc., as well as SR Auction Inc. The acquisitions were integrated with FreeMarkets' existing asset business to form the FreeMarkets AssetExchange, a leading B2B eMarketplace for buying and selling new and used assets.

After World War I, he began Surplus Record, which grew into a national trade publication for the used-machinery business which listed used machine tools and capital equipment. The first publication of the Surplus Record directory was in November 1924.

During World War II, Scanlan advised manufacturers on ways of keeping their equipment in production, testified to Congress regarding the price stabilization of machine tools Office of Price Administration, and after the war he helped companies dispose of war surplus property.
