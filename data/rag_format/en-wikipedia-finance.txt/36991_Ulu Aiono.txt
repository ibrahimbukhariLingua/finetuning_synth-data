## Career as civic leader

In October 2005, Ulu was a forum member of the Auckland Regional Economic Development Forum which was responsible for the stewardship of the ongoing implementation of the ARED Strategy and the Metro Project Action Plan. The ARED Strategy set a vision and directions for the economic and social well-being of all Aucklanders. The Metro Project Action Plan was developed subsequently to enable the implementation of the Strategy. The forum was replaced by new departments within the Auckland Council after the inaugural super-city elections on 9 October 2010 and this is when Ulu ceased his time here.

While being a forum member, Ulu was also a University Council Member at Auckland University of Technology from 2002 to 2010. During this time, the New Zealand Governor General (1985–1990) Sir Paul Reeves was the chancellor and also Ulu's governance teacher and coach.

During November 2008, Ulu joined the People's Centre Trust (TPCT) Board and later became the Chairman in 2010. TPCT was a primary health organisation (PHO) providing medical and dental services to over 8,000 patients located in Central Auckland, Mangere and Manurewa. Most of the patients were Māori, Pacific Islanders, new immigrants and refugees.

Ulu was appointed Chairman of National Pacific Radio Trust on 1 October 2010. NPRT was established in May 2002 to direct government funded projects such as various campaigns which promoted anti-family violence and awareness for rheumatic fever and chronic illness. Ulu would continue his role as Chairman into 2011 as appointed by Hon Jonathan Coleman, Minister of Broadcasting and again in 2013 as appointed by Hon Craig Foss. After seven years, Ulu would retire from his role as Chairman of National Pacific Radio Trust on 31 July 2017 after usurping a role as council member at the Manukau Institute of Technology.

Ulu stepped down from this role in December 2016 where he was preceded by Michael McLean, a fellow board member of his.

Ulu was ministerially appointed as a board member of the Pacific Business Trust by the New Zealand government in July 2014. In this role, he considered social and economic factors which contributed to the under-employment of Pacific Islanders in New Zealand and what was needed to fix this. Ulu's answer was to create entrepreneurs. In September 2015, Ulu would step down from his role as board member from the Pacific Business Trust.

## Manukau Institute of Technology and charity boards

On 12 June 2017, Hon Paul Goldsmith would appoint Ulu as council member at the Manukau Institute of Technology and as an alumnus of Auckland University of Technology Council, he learned a lot about the tertiary education sector that he'd implement in this role. In this role, Ulu claimed "If Aotearoa NZ's tertiary education leaders do not develop radical, effective, methods of drastically cutting the lead time to produce skilled people...then Kiwis will have to get used to being foreigners in their own country."

In 2010, Ulu became Chairman of Cloud Region Limited, an entrepreneurial company under the COGITA group that provided computing services to New Zealand's primary health sector and the global online travel bookings industry. Cloud Region Ltd ceased trading in 2012 as it was acquired by 2Onions Ltd, but Ulu still remains Chairman.

Since February 2017, Ulu has been the Treasurer of the RiseUp Trust. What started out as a home-schooling programme in the garage of its founder, Sita Selupe, grew into an initiative that connects Māori and Pacific families to a three-way learning process, where Whanau Educators take parents and their children through real-life, problem-solving strategies in order to reach higher academic achievement and greater engagement in their children’s education. RiseUp values connecting children with their parents and stresses the importance of knowing your roots. The trust opened The Rise Up Academy*,* a charter school in Mangere, in 2014. The Rise UP Academy transitioned to a Designated Character School in 2019. Ulu remains as Deputy Chairman and Treasurer.

On 1 September 2017, one of New Zealand's newest biotech companies, SensorFlo, was introduced into the industry with Ulu as Chairman and Seed Capital Funding First Investor. On 21 January 2018, SensorFlo received ethics approval for their first clinical trial and would later seek FDA certification. Progress was made when Callaghan Innovation approved a research and development grant for SensorFlo which enabled experimental designs on non-invasive blood glucose measurement. SensorFlo would later receive notice of allowance granting noninvasive blood glucose patent from the US Patent Office, which lasts 20 years, in 2020 and a European Patent granted in June 2021 after a second clinical trial ethics application was approved. Ulu remains actives in this role at SensorFlo but is now also Director as of 2019.

Since 2016, Ulu has been the Chairman of The Cause Collective NZ. Established in August 2010, The Cause Collective is a Pacific social change organisation working out of South Auckland that focuses on the causes of social problems facing communities most in need to see what obstacles prevent them from thriving. In January 2022, Ulu began building a team for the development of a new product and work begun through Aqil Abbas in the Netherlands. In October 2022, the team released a limited prototype to a cohort of 500 people. In December 2022, Ulu integrated The Cause Collective and Alliance Health Plus. He said, "The combination and integration of our two organisations’ collective skills and experience will make us more effective in identifying the bottlenecks and constraint in the full inventory of determinants for health and wellbeing. Only then can any organisation improve prevention, reduce inequity and inequality in health, and cause people in our communities to live longer, healthier, quality lives."

On Tuesday 21 March 2023, The Cause Collective started a new programme, Get Ready, Work Ready, which aims to equip Pacific youth in Auckland with employment skills to the enter the workforce or into further training.

Ulu was raised Christian and is still man of faith today. He credits his faith in his success and believes recognition for his journey is not only his own but rather shared. In a 2011 interview with Vaimoana Tapaleao, Ulu declares:
