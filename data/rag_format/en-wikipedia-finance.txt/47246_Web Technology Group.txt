Web Technology Group


# Web Technology Group



**Web Technology Group** was a technology consultancy and solutions provider to the UK Public Sector, specialising in the design, build and management of secure, high value and complex web applications, based in London, UK. WTG was purchased by Civica in 2015.


## History

Originally known as Hyperlink, then as hyperlink-interactive, Web Technology Group was acquired by Cable & Wireless in 2000. Web Technology Group remained a subsidiary of Cable & Wireless until its sale in February 2007 at which time it became an independent organisation. It is a UK company based in Hammersmith. It is known for building and operating systems such as Impact Nominal Index and was voted most efficient technical agency in the New Media Age 100 for 2008.

One of the most successful projects in Web Technology Group's recent history was their involvement in the online version of the 2011 UK Census, working in collaboration with Lockheed Martin and Cable & Wireless.

Web Technology Group also ran the Coalclaims site on behalf of Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR).

This was the biggest personal injury scheme in British legal history and possibly the world, settling around 10,000 claims a month at their peak for ex-miners in the UK. Over 760,000 claims are registered and Â£3.9 billion in compensation has been paid to date.
