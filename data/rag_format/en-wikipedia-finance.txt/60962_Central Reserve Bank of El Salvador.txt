Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador


# Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador



The **Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador** (Spanish: *Banco Central de El Salvador*) is the central bank of El Salvador, which controls the currency rate and regulates certain economic activities within El Salvador. The bank was originally privately owned, but was brought under state control through The Law on the Reorganization of Central Banking.

It was in charge of issuing Salvadoran colón coins and banknotes until the Monetary Integration Law of 2000 started the process of dollarizing the Salvadoran economy. In 2001, it stopped issuing new colón currency and no longer maintains a monetary policy of its own.

The bank is active in developing financial inclusion policy and is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. In 2013, the bank made a joint Maya Declaration Commitment with the Superintendencia del Sistema Financiero of El Salvador to carry out a series of concrete and measurable actions.
