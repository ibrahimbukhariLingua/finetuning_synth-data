## Estate

When Nelson Davis died in 1979 he left his estate worth tens of millions of dollars to his son, Glen Davis. Glen donated to numerous conservation and philanthropic organizations until he was murdered, on May 18, 2007. Davis was gunned down in the underground parking lot of an office building at Mt. Pleasant and Eglinton in Toronto. The "hit" was ordered and paid for by Davis's cousin, Marshall Ross, who believed that he would be named as a beneficiary in Davis's will; the funds received would be used to pay off Ross's massive debts, and protect his vaunted lifestyle. Shortly after the murder, Davis's company sued Ross for repayment of an earlier loan. The court decided in the company's favour, but no money has been repaid. Marshall Ross remains in federal prison, sentenced to life after pleading guilty to masterminding Davis's murder.
