Batzen


# Batzen



The **batzen** is a historical Swiss, south German and Austrian coin. It was first produced in Bern, Switzerland, from 1492 and continued in use there until the mid-19th century.


## Name

Bernese chronicler Valerius Anshelm explained the word from a folk etymology perspective saying that it came from *Bëtz* ("bear"), the heraldic animal of the Swiss canton, which was embossed on the reverse of the coin. The word probably goes back to Upper German (particularly Bavarian) *batzen* ("stick together") or *Batzen* ("lump, thick piece"), since it referred to a *Dickpfennig* ("fat pfennig").


## History

A double *Plappart*, which soon became known as a *Batzen*, was minted in Bern from 1492. The minting of *Batzen* in Salzburg is also attested early on, in 1495.

The *Batzen* was originally minted in silver, but from the 17th century in billon. The value of the *Batzen* varied over time depending on where it was minted. The value of a Bernese *Batzen* initially corresponded to four *Kreuzer*. Since the *Gulden* was worth 60 *Kreuzer*, 1 *Batzen* in Bern, Freiburg and Solothurn also corresponded to one fifteenth of a *Gulden*. Later there were also *Grossi* ("thick ones", i.e. *Groschen*) worth 5 *Batzen*. Other places of the Old Confederation and some southern German states soon followed Bern's example. Zürich minted 16 *Batzen* to the *Gulden* from 1500 onwards. In 1564, a Thaler was worth 16 Constance *Batzen*. Around 1600, 1 *Bocksthaler* (Schaffhausen *Thaler*) was worth 17 *Batzen* or 68 *Kreuzer*, so 1 *Batzen* = 1⁄17 *Thaler* = 4 *Kreuzer*. In the early 18th century the *Hohlbatzen* ("hollow *Batzen*") was worth five *Kreuzer* (1/12 *Reichsgulden*), the regular *Batzen* four *Kreuzer*, the Basel and Zürich *Batzen* were valued at 1⁄18 *Gulden*, the St. Gallen *Batzen* at 1⁄17 *Gulden*. In the second half of the 18th century, 1 *Reichsbatzen* was worth 16 *Pfennigs*, 1 Zürich *Batzen* was 15 *Pfennigs*, 1 Bernese or 1 Chur *Batzen* was 14 *Pfennigs*.

The *Batzen* became a widespread intermediate currency between the numerous large and small silver coins circulating in Europe. Since some of the South German *Batzen* were of very different quality, the Reichstag in 1522 and 1524 spoke out against these coins. In southern Germany they were minted until 1536, but were banned by the Imperial Minting Ordinance of 1559. However it was still, for example in Nuremberg, in 1564 in use as a currency designation. In Switzerland, on the other hand, the *Batzen* went unchallenged.

In the case of some so-called Kipper coins, however, the *Batzen* was used to name these interim coins. In the time of counterfeiting, the Kipper and Wipper period, for example in Thuringia *inter alia* in the mints of Gotha (1621–1623) and Weimar (1619–1622), other Kipper coins worth three and six *Batzen* were minted (the *Dreibätzner* and *Sechsbätzner*). The coins could not be objected to, because they were state coins, not *Thaler* coins or divisions of them, which had to conform to imperial coinage regulations.

Even after the Munich Coinage Treaty of 1837, *Batzen* were minted as *Scheidemünzen* to the value of four *Kreuzers* in some member states, for example in the Free City of Frankfurt. The coins were in use until the introduction of the Mark in 1871. As late as 1873, the increase in the price of beer by the Frankfurt breweries from 4 to 4½ *Kreuzer* triggered the Frankfurt beer riot, which began with the demand "I want Batzen beer" (*Mir wolle Batzebier*) and led to serious social unrest.

When a Swiss single currency was introduced for the first time in 1798–1803 by the Helvetic Republic, the *Batzen* was also integrated into the system. One franc was worth ten *Batzen*, one *Batzen* in turn ten centimes, with 10 Swiss francs being equivalent to a Louis d'or. After the end of the single currency, coin sovereignty was returned to the cantons, some of which retained the decimal Franc-Batzen-Rappen division (Aargau, city of Basel, Bern, Freiburg, Lucerne, Solothurn, Unterwalden, Uri, Vaud, Valais, Zug). Only in the canton of Neuchâtel was a franc worth 10½ *Batzen*. The other cantons introduced currencies with a *Gulden-Schilling* or Florin-Livre system. The era of the *Batzen* ended in 1850 with the introduction of the new Swiss franc as the single Swiss currency. An old franc did not correspond to a new franc. Seven *Batzen* could be exchanged for a new franc in 1850. Meanwhile, the *Batzen* became a colloquial term for the 10 *Rappen* (10 cent) coin.
