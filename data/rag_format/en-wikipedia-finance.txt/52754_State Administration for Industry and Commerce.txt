# State Administration for Industry and Commerce



Prior to March 2018, the **State Administration for Industry and Commerce** (**SAIC**; Chinese: 国家工商行政管理总局) was the authority in the People's Republic of China responsible for advancing legislation concerning the administration of industry and commerce in the People's Republic. On a local level, the organizations responsibilities roughly mimicked those of the secretaries of individual states in the United States as a registration and licensing authority. The last minister was Zhang Mao (张茅).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
