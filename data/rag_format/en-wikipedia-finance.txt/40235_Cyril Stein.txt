His father, known as “Honest Jack”, worked for the London and Provincial Sporting News Agency, which relayed information between off-course bookmakers and racecourses.

He married Betty Young in 1949. He was survived by his wife sons Jonathan and Daniel and daughter Marion, and several grandchildren.

An Orthodox Jew, he was never seen at a racetrack on a Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, and was frequently seen in public wearing a knitted kippah.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He used his money and influence to try to keep the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in Israeli hands.
