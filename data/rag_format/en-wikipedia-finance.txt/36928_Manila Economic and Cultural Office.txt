Manila Economic and Cultural Office


# Manila Economic and Cultural Office



The **Manila Economic and Cultural Office** simple known as **MECO** is the representative office of the Philippines in Taiwan, functioning as a de facto embassy in the absence of diplomatic relations. It is a non-stock, non-profit corporation organized under Philippine law.

It was first established in 1975 as the **Asian Exchange Center**, replacing the former Philippine Embassy. In 1984, its staff acquired diplomatic privileges and immunity, as did those of its Taiwanese counterpart in Manila, then known as the **Pacific Economic and Cultural Center**. It adopted its present name in December 1989.

In addition to its Taipei Office, it also maintains Extension Offices in Kaohsiung and Taichung.

Its counterpart body in the Philippines is the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines in Manila.

In September 2024, Cheloy Garafil was appointed as the new Chairperson and Resident Representative of the office.
