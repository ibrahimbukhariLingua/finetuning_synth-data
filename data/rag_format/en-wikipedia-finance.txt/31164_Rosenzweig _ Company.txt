The Rosenzweig Report analyzes the prevalence of female executives at the 100 largest publicly traded companies in the country. The publication has been referenced in the annual report of the Status of Women Canada, a federal government organization devoted to the advancement of women in Canadian life, in 2008 and 2009, and has been cited in news coverage around the world.

Sheryl Sandberg, Van Jones, Zainab Salbi, Andrew Yang, Chloe Flower, and Jason Flom contributed to the wide-ranging 2019 report. Inno & Tech Today pointed to the Rosenzweig Report to conclude that "discrimination is alive and well" and that the representation gap between men and women in the technology industry remained wide.
