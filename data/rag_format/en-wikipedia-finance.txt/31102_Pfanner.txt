## History

The company was founded in 1856. In 1856 *Max Hermann Pfanner* bought the "Gasthof Hirschen" restaurant in Lauterach and founded a small in-house brewery. In 1919 his grandson *Hermann Pfanner* took over and expanded the business by selling various agricultural products, wines and spirits.

By 1933 fruit juice was produced for the first time. After *Hermann Pfanner* died, his wife *Ferdinanda* and their children continued the business. Due to thoughtful business practices and technical innovations, they could pass on the company to the next generation (*Hedwig, Hans, Erwin* and *Egon Pfanner*). This generation expanded the fruit juice business internationally. By 1984 these efforts were rewarded by the Austrian government with the coat of arms of Austria. In 1988 Hermann Pfanner Getränke GmbH was founded and handed over to the succeeding generation.

In 2001 fruit juice production in Hamburg was started to cater to the growing German market. Pfanner is still a family-run business, managed by the *Pfanner, Schneider* and *Dietrich* families.

In 2006, the company exceeded 200 million Euros in sales for the first time.
