## History

The company was formed in 1989 as Yandex N.V. by Arkady Volozh as a holding company for Yandex.

On May 24, 2011, the company raised $1.3 billion in an initial public offering on NASDAQ, the biggest initial public offering for a dot-com company since Google's offering in 2004. At that time, Baring Vostok Capital Partners owned a 35% stake in the company and Tiger Technologies owned a 15% stake.

In March 2022, the company's securities were suspended for trading on the Nasdaq due to international sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company repurchased its convertible bonds per their terms in September 2022.

In July 2024, due to international sanctions during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it sold Yandex to a consortium of Russian investors, retaining several businesses that operated outside of Russia, and was renamed Nebius Group. Its shares then resumed trading on the Nasdaq.

In late 2024, the company announced several investment initiatives including: plans to invest $1 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in Europe by mid-2025 including a new GPU cluster in Paris and tripling the capacity of its data center in Mäntsälä, Finland, to up to 60,000 Nvidia GPUs, a cloud computing platform using processors from Nvidia focused on artificial intelligence applications, the leasing of data center space in Kansas City, and customer support hubs and offices in San Francisco, Dallas, and New York City, with plans to open a cloud computing operation in the United States with up to 35,000 Nvidia chips, and a $700 million equity financing round from Nvidia, Accel and accounts managed by Orbis Investment Management.
