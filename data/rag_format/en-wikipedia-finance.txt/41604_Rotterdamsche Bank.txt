Rotterdamsche Bank


# Rotterdamsche Bank



The **Rotterdamsche Bank**, known from 1911 to 1947 as **Rotterdamsche Bankvereeniging** or **Robaver**, was a significant bank in the Netherlands, founded in 1863. In 1964, it merged with Amsterdamsche Bank to form AMRO Bank (for AMsterdamsche & ROtterdamsche).


## Overview

The Rotterdamsche Bank was established on 16 May 1863 by a group of businessmen and bankers, who took inspiration from the British Colonial Bank and aimed at financing trade and investment in the Dutch East Indies. After a difficult start, however, the bank soon focused on domestic business.

Between 1911 and 1947 it was known as the Union Bank of Rotterdam (Dutch: *Rotterdamsche Bank Vereeniging*, abbreviated as Robaver), following its 1911 acquisition of Rotterdam competitor *Deposito- en Administratie Bank* (est. 1900) and soon afterwards of Amsterdam brokers *Determeijer Weslingh & Zn.* (est. 1765). Under the leadership of its ambitious managing director Willem Westerman [nl], it went on to acquire a number of local banks, but became overextended and had to be restructured under the aegis of De Nederlandsche Bank in the mid-1920s. In 1928, it created the Vrouwenbank [nl] ("Women's Bank"), a bank targeted at a female customer base that lasted until 1971.

In 1960, Rotterdamsche Bank acquired Nationale Handelsbank, a major former colonial bank that had been known until 1950 as the Dutch-Indian Trade Bank (Dutch: *Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank*, NIHB; est. 1863).
