The **Austrian Institute of Economic Research** (German: *Österreichisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung, WIFO*) is a private non-profit association located in Vienna, Austria.

The institute was founded in 1927 by Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises as *Österreichisches Institut für Konjunkturforschung* ("Austrian Institute for Business-Cycle Research").

It has also established ties to institutes in the US, Australia and Asia.


## Research Activities

WIFO analyses national and international economic trends and supplies short- to medium-term economic forecasts. Together with studies on European integration, competitiveness and location of industries and services, these trends and forecasts provide the basis for economic policies and corporate strategies. Research activities are bundled in the following five departments:

* Macroeconomics and European Economic Policy
* Labour market, income and social security
* Industrial economics, innovation and international competition
* Structural change and regional developments
* Environment, agriculture and energy

WIFO's activities include commissioned research and consulting for domestic and international decision-making bodies, the European Commission, the OECD, major business and financial institutions. It has established an extensive information system of regularly updated economic statistics, including U.N. Foreign Trade Statistics, World Debt Tables of the World Bank, the IMF International Financial Statistics, OECD Main Economic Indicators, and OECD Economic Outlook. It also publishes journals, reports, newsletters, and periodicals.

## History

WIFO was established in 1927 by economists Friedrich August von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises. The institute was modeled after the Ernst Wagemann's Berlin-based Institute for Economic Research.

The institute has undergone a number of naming variations following the merger of WIFO with Ernst Wagemann's institute in 1938. Initially the organisation was referred to as the *Vienna Institute for Economic and Business Research,* this was later adapted to the *Vienna Institute for Economic Research*.

After the war, the institute was revived by Franz Nemschak under the name Austrian Institute for Economic Research.
