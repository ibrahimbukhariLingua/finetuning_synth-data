## THE STATE CONCERN “TURKMENNEBIT”

The State Concern “Turkmennebit” is a powerful, large, vertically integrated production complex. The Concern carries out the industrial development of oil and gas fields, the production of oil, gas, gas condensate, useful components from additional by-products obtained with them, conducts search, extraction, concentrated accumulation, preparation, transportation, processing. The State Concern “Turkmennebit” provides the population, sectors of the national economy with oil and petrochemical products, liquefied gas and other finished products and sells them on the foreign market. And also with the introduction of advanced innovative technologies and international experience in oil and gas into the oil industry of our country, the state programs for the development of the oil industry are being implemented.
The Concern includes the trusts “Nebitgazchykarysh”, “Nebitgazburavlayysh", “Nebitgazduypliabatlayysh”. Department of “Turkmennebitgeofizika”, Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries, Seydi oil refinery, Main Department of “Turkmennebitonumleri”, Institute “Nebitgazylmytaslama”, Balkanabat Petroleum Secondary Vocational School, Department of Material and Technical Resources and Supply, as well as the editorial office of the journal “Turkmenistanyn nebiti, gazy ve mineral serishdeleri”.
With the successful fulfillment of the tasks assigned to the State Concern “Turkmennebit”, great importance is attached to international cooperation. Currently, Turkmen specialists, together with the Singapore company “Yug Neftegaz”, the public joint stock company “Tatneft” of the Russian Federation, the International Oil Service Company (“SINOPEC”) under the China Petrochemical Corporation, are carrying out work on the overhaul of oil wells. The introduction of new technologies in the course of this work leads to the achievement of positive results.
Along with the main production, the State Concern “Turkmennebit” controls the work of Contracting Companies that carry out oil work in accordance with the Law of Turkmenistan “On Hydrocarbon Resources” and the Production Sharing Agreement. At present, cooperation with Dragon Oil (Turkmenistan) Ltd. is carried out on the Cheleken contractual territory, and with Eni Türkmenistan Limited on the Nebitdag contractual territory. On the contractual territory “Hazar” with the joint participation of the closed joint-stock company “Turkmen National Oil and Gas Company” and the company “Mitro International Limited” cooperation in oil and gas production is carried out.
In 2017, at the Uzynada site, located in the Caspian region of Western Turkmenistan, for the first time after the completion of drilling operations and during the development of an exploration well with a design depth of 7150 meters, a large flow of gas and oil condensate was obtained. Since then, dozens of wells have been drilled here and are now being commercially developed. The high productivity of the drilled and developed wells at this site testifies to the enormous potential of the Caspian Turkmen shallow water and coastal zone.
The Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries is a large enterprise for the processing of oil and gas condensate, the production of various oil and petrochemical products. The complex includes several facilities for primary oil refining, as well as devices for secondary oil refining to increase advanced oil refining.
ELDAD-HT is the main process system of the plant, which produces catalytic cracking and reforming, jet fuel purifier, diesel fuel water purifier, olefin alkylation and light gas isomerizer. There are workshops for the production of polypropylene coatings, bitumen, general petroleum coke, calcined petroleum coke, lubricating oils, polypropylene and polypropylene bags. The infrastructural devices of the plant ensure the uninterrupted operation of the technological production facilities of the complex of plants, the Complex is equipped with gas turbine power plants, sea water desalination plants, steam generators, secondary water coolers, pumping stations, tank farms, electrical substations and other auxiliary facilities, etc. The complex of plants produces the main types of products of the oil and petrochemical industries. Of these, you can specify motor gasoline of various grades, diesel fuel, base, diesel and universal oils of various grades, polypropylene and polypropylene bags, various polypropylene coatings, marine fuel, kerosene, petroleum coke, construction and road oil bitumen and other products.
At the Seydi oil refinery, it consists of three main technological facilities: ELOU-AVT-6, LCH 35-11/500 and production devices for the production of viscous oil road bitumen and several additional auxiliary facilities for their maintenance and workshops. Currently, the refinery processes oil and gas condensate and produces various grades of gasoline, liquefied gas, diesel fuel, fuel oil, viscous road oil bitumen, and heavy vacuum gas oil.
The main directions for the development of oil refineries consist of introducing new technologies, improving the quality and competitiveness of manufactured products and bringing products in line with developed world standards, as well as fully complying with the requirements of new international standards aimed at protecting nature and maintaining environmental cleanliness. High-quality oil and petrochemical products produced at the Turkmenbashi complex of oil refineries and the Seydi oil refinery are exported to various destinations, namely to Europe, Asia, and the countries of the Middle East.
The Main Department of “Turkmennebitonumleri” is an enterprise that ensures the accounting of oil products in the domestic market of Turkmenistan, their timely and unhindered sale, and the holder of the resource of products for industrial purposes.

Scientific achievements, recommendations of the institute’s specialists, measures and inventions for which patents have been obtained are aimed at increasing the level of oil and gas production.
The State Concern “Turkmennebit” attracts experienced companies with advanced companies to further improve the production of the oil industry and cooperate to increase oil production, increase the types of oil and petrochemical products produced.


## Methane Emissions

In May 2023 the Guardian published a report, blaming Turkmenistan in general and Turkmenoil in particular to be the worst in the world for methane *super emitting*. The greenhouse gas was emitted in large amounts from flare stacks that had been extinguished and from a few pipeline leaks. Researchers suspected continuous flaring had been stopped to prevent conflicts with Turkmenistans laws and replaced by venting, which is also illegal, but much harder to detect. The data collected by Kayrros researchers indicate that two large fossil fuel fields leaked 2.6m and 1.8m tonnes of methane in 2022 alone, pumping the CO₂ equivalent of 366m tonnes into the atmosphere, surpassing the annual CO₂ emissions of the United Kingdom for 2022.
