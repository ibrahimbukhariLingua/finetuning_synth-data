The party advocated for substantial economic reform, including a universal basic income, re-regulation of the banking system, monetary reform including a system of multiple currencies, and to "remove the imperative for growth". It also sought a system whereby the Treasury would issue tax vouchers and trade them to buy land, using revenue on that land to pay dividends to the public.


## Electoral record

The party ran a single candidate in the 2011 election: Laurence Boomert in Wellington Central. Boomert had previously stood for the Progressive Greens in 1996 and for the Greens in 1999. Boomert received 44 votes (0.11%), coming 11th of 12 candidates.

It did not stand any candidates at the 2014 election, with Boomert standing instead for the Money Free Party in the West Coast-Tasman electorate.
