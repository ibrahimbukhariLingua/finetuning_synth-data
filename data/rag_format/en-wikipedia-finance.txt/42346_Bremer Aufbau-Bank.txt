Bremer Aufbau-Bank


# Bremer Aufbau-Bank



**Bremer Aufbau-Bank** (**BAB**) is the regional promotional bank (German: *Förderbank*) of the German state of Bremen. It was established in 1951, and its current development bank mandate was defined by law in 2001.


## Overview

The bank operates under an explicit guarantee from the Bremen government, provided by state law. Like other *Förderbanken*, it does not compete directly with commercial banks but supplements them with co-lending, co-investment and guarantees. In 2023, it ramped up its programs to support local start-ups.

Together with other *Förderbanken* and the more commercially oriented Landesbanken, BAB is a member of the Association of German Public Banks (VÖB).
