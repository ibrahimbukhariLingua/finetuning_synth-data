## *The Price of Football*

Maguire is the author of the book *The Price of Football*, and presents a twice-weekly podcast alongside the comedian Kevin Day in which they discuss contemporary issues regarding, and listener questions concerning, the finances of modern day men and women’s football clubs. The podcast had a quarter of a million downloads within its first five months. This figure had doubled to 500,000 listens by May 2020.


### Critical reactions

The reviewer for the Columbia University Press wrote: "At a time when many commentators are bemoaning the effects of “too much money” in the game, this clear-headed and rigorous analysis and presentation of the financial imperatives and challenges facing football will be welcomed not only by students of the industry, but by the wider constituency of fans and supporters."

Margaret Decker, writing in *Blues Trust* said "*The Price of Football* by Kieran Maguire is an excellent book for anyone who wants to understand how money impacts the game of football. You don't have to be an accountant to understand it."

Stephen Mumford writing in *Times Higher Education* said "This book should be essential reading for anyone even remotely considering investing in football (and, unless they are super-rich, they should probably stay away). For general readers, it won’t exactly enhance your enjoyment of football, but it should at least increase your understanding of what goes on and why."

Writing in *Soccer & Society*, Steve Menary says of the book: "In chapters 1-6, Maguire offers a simple but cogent explanation of a set of club accounts, then in the second half of the book looks to place annual accounts within the context of real financial issues ..." and "Manchester United' supporters will be better equipped to make a more informed decision ... after reading *The Price of Football."*

Writing in *The Guardian* about the podcast, Miranda Sawyer says: "Obviously, this one isn’t for anyone who actively dislikes football, but for even a casual fan (me), it’s a very interesting listen. Kevin Day .., teams up with financial expert Kieran Maguire ..." and "Day asks the right questions and Maguire is impressive with his research: in last week’s show he pointed out that a newspaper financial football story was completely wrong, without being rude about it. The machinations of sponsorship, TV rights, stand maintenance, even crowdfunding, are laid bare, and somehow this sheds light on to the actual games themselves."

In November 2019, the podcast was nominated for the 2019 Football Supporters' Federation Online Media of the Year Award alongside FourFourTwo, David Squires, and eventual winners The Athletic.

*The Price of Football* was shortlisted for the Fan Media of the Year at the 2020 Football Supporters' Association awards, and for their Online Media Award in 2021. In November 2023, The Price of Football was nominated in the Podcast of the Year category at the Football Supporters' Association awards.
