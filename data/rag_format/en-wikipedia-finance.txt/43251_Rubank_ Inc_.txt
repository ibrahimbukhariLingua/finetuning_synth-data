# Rubank, Inc.



**Rubank, Inc**., founded in 1926, was a large music publisher based in Chicago that is now, by way of acquisition, part of the **Hal Leonard Corporation**. Rubank specialized in music aimed at the music education market.


## History

Rubank was born out of a three-way partnership of **Finder & Urbanek** of Chicago, a large music publisher, jobber, and manufacturer of specialties for the saxophone. Finder & Urbanek incorporated and changed its name to Rubank, Inc. in 1927 when **George Adam Finder** (pronounced *FEN der* not *FIND er*; 1894–1962), one of the partners, sold his interest to the other partners, **Harry Ruppel, Sr**. (1888–1957) and **Joseph James Urbanek** (1894–1953).

Rubank eventually moved to Miami and was managed by **Edward H. Wolske** (president), **Judith Ann Nelson** (secretary), and **Janice Beth Ruppel** (vice president) (1948–2006). The corporation, still an Illinois entity, filed for voluntary dissolution in 1988.
