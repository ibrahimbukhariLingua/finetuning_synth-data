**SGSP (Australia) Assets Pty Ltd** (**SGSPAA**), trading as **Jemena**, is an Australian company that owns, manages or operates energy infrastructure assets in the eastern states of Australia including Queensland and New South Wales, and gas pipelines and gas and electricity distribution networks in Victoria and the Northern Territory. It is 60% owned by State Grid Corporation of China and 40% by Singapore Power.


## History

In January 1995, the vertical monopolist energy supplier, the State Energy Commission of Western Australia, was dis-aggregated into separate gas and electricity corporations, leading to the formation of **AlintaGas**. On 13 July 2000 legislation was passed by the Parliament of Western Australia for the sale of AlintaGas, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on 17 October 2000. On 8 May 2003 AlintaGas Ltd changed its name to Alinta Limited. Alinta acquired infrastructure assets and the *Agility* business from AGL through a combination of merger and demerger transactions on 25 October 2006.

Alinta was acquired on 31 August 2007 by a consortium comprising Singapore Power International (SPI), the largest utility company in Singapore, and Australia's second-largest investment bank, Babcock & Brown Infrastructure (BBI) and Babcock & Brown Power (BBP) with a bid of A$13.9 billion, outbidding a bid by Macquarie Bank. After acquisition, the Alinta businesses were split up. The majority of eastern assets were transferred to **Alinta AGL**, an Alinta subsidiary, which on 4 August 2008 changed its name to **Jemena**. Later, ownership of Jemena passed to Singapore Power International, and its name was changed to **SPI (Australia) Assets Pty Ltd**. In 2014, State Grid Corporation of China acquired a 60% stake in Jemena, and the company's name was changed to **SGSP (Australia) Assets Pty Ltd** (SGSPAA). The company continues to trade as Jemena.
