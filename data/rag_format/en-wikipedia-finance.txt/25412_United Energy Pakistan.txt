**United Energy Pakistan (UEP)**, formerly known as **BP Pakistan**, is a subsidiary of Chinese United Energy Group in Pakistan with a footprint in Sindh province of Pakistan, around 100Â km to the east of Karachi.


## History

In 2007, Occidental Petroleum exited Pakistan and solds its assets to BP Pakistan.

In 2011, United Energy Group acquired the Pakistani assets of BP and BP Pakistan was renamed as UEP. A year later, in 2012, UEP secured a credit line of $5 billion from China Development Bank for its Pakistani operations and other potential acquisitions.

In March 2018, UEP acquired OMV's gas fields in Pakistan for US$192 million. Previously, OMV had acquired Petronas' gas fields in Pakistan when it decided to exit Pakistan in 2010.

In 2019, United Energy Pakistan was the largest foreign oil and gas exploration and production company in Pakistan, and remained 9th on the list with exports worth $227 million.
