# Gojek



**PT Gojek Indonesia** (stylized in all lower case and stylized *j* as **goȷek**, formerly styled as **GO-JEK**) is an Indonesian on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group based in Jakarta. Gojek was first established in Indonesia in 2009 as a call center to connect consumers to courier delivery and two-wheeled ride-hailing services. Gojek launched its application in 2015 with only four services: GoRide, GoSend, GoShop, and GoFood. Valued at US$10 billion today, Gojek has transformed into a super app, providing more than 20 services.

Gojek operates in 5 countries: Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines (through the acquisition of Coins.ph). Gojek is the first Indonesian unicorn company as well as the country's first "decacorn" company. It is the only company in Southeast Asia that is included in *Fortune*'s "50 Companies That Changed the World" in 2017 and 2019, ranked at 17 and 11, respectively. As of June 2020, it has about 170 million users throughout Southeast Asia.

On 17 May 2021, Gojek and Tokopedia announced the completion of their merger and established a new holding company, called GoTo.

Gojek has won financial backing from investors including Astra International, Blibli, Google, Facebook, PayPal, Mitsubishi, Sequoia, Northstar Group, Temasek Holdings, KKR, Warburg Pincus, Visa, Parallon, Siam Commercial Bank, Tencent, JD.com, meituan.com, and Capital Group, among others.


## History

The name Gojek comes from the term “Ojek” or motorbike taxis commonly found throughout Indonesia. It was founded in 2010 with 20 motorbike drivers. Gojek app was launched in January 2015, and in less than two years, the app racked up nearly 30 million downloads. Gojek has partnered with Singapore's biggest bank DBS.

Gojek was co-founded by Nadiem Makarim and Michaelangelo Moran. Nadiem, a native Indonesian, holds degrees from Brown University and Harvard Business School. He worked at McKinsey and Co. consulting for three years before starting Gojek from a tiny call centre with only 20 ojek drivers, who later became recruiters. As a loyal ojek user, Nadiem discovered that ojek drivers spend most of their times waiting for customers, while customers waste time walking around looking for an available ojek. Gojek was built to solve this problem, by providing a platform where drivers and riders can connect efficiently and allowing those drivers to improve their income. The other co-founder and long time high school friend, Michaelangelo Moran, aside from serving as the company's Brand Director, is also known for designing the company's first iconic logo and branding the whole company.

As of May 2018, the app offers 18 services, with 2 upcoming new services in the online content business, which makes for a total of 20 on-demand services under one platform. Being an Indonesian-run startup played to Gojek's advantage in navigating the local regulatory environment, as well as understanding the local market. This enabled them to bundle features into its app that better suit both local drivers and local consumers. Gojek recruited 100 new graduates in engineering domain from India in 2017.

In 2020, the company launched GoStore, a solution that helps local micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) set up online stores with ease.


### Financing

Gojek's journey in becoming a unicorn startup started in late-2014 when it secured its first financing round from NSI Ventures (now Openspace Ventures), the venture capital fund in the Northstar Group. Due to rapid growth in early 2015, Gojek attracted additional investments from Sequoia India and Northstar's private equity fund.

After closing a round of funding in August 2016 that raised up to $550 million, two of Indonesia's biggest companies, Astra International, and Blibli.com, invested in Gojek. International investors include tech giants such as American firm Google and Chinese Tencent, along with the global investment company Temasek. A survey revealed Gojek as the most popular ride-hailing app in Indonesia. The company is valued at about $5 billion as of February 2018, which exceeds the total market cap of all transportation companies in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX).

In May 2018, it was announced that Gojek is investing $500 million towards its international expansion strategy. In January 2019, the startup closed another round of financing for $2 billion. The total valuation of the company reached $9.5 billion.

In March 2020, Gojek announced it has received $1.2 Billion in funding for its Series F round. The valuation it was seeking for was U$10 Billion USD.

In June 2020, Facebook's messaging platform WhatsApp and PayPal announced they had invested in Gojek as part of the ongoing fundraising round. The size and nature of the investments were not disclosed, but they were described as "meaningful".


### Acquisitions and merger

The company's rapid growth triggered a chain of acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016, Gojek announced acquisition of two engineering startups based in India, C42 Engineering and CodeIgnition, and established a development centre in Bangalore, India.

In February 2021, Gojek was reported to be close to a merger with Tokopedia, shortly before publicly listing in the U.S. and Indonesian stock markets.

On 17 May 2021, Tokopedia and Gojek confirmed a merger with the establishment of a new entity, GoTo. The establishment of GoTo would make it one of Southeast Asia's largest technology conglomerates. GoTo's gross transaction volume (GTV) was over $22 billion in 2020, across more than 1.8 billion transactions.

In July 2021, AirAsia announced that the company will be acquiring Gojek's business in Thailand via an all-stock deal. Upon the acquisition, Gojek will hold a 4.76% stake in AirAsia's superapp business.

## Criticism and controversy

Gojek's rapid growth and market dominance in Indonesia have led to prominent media coverage, including criticism primarily stemming from conventional taxi and Ojek services. Go-Jek was briefly banned from operations by the Ministry of Transportation, along with other ride-hailing services. The ban was opposed by a huge number of Indonesians, mustering public support with the hashtag #SaveGojek that became a top trending topic on Twitter in Indonesia. The ban was lifted the very same day after President Joko Widodo criticized it, stating the government should not prohibit innovation and asserting the ban would adversely affect the lives of many Indonesians who rely on Gojek's services. In October 2018, the Indonesian Minister of Transportation, Budi Karya Sumadi, applied a new rule for online taxis. PM 108 replaced the previous PM 26, regulating the use of private cars being used for public transportation.

In March 2018, only weeks after the firm raised a new round of capital, thousands of drivers showed up on foot along the road across the Presidential palace in a demonstration against the tariff, which was roughly 1600 rupiah (15 cents) per kilometer then. The demand was continued in a future protest in January 2020, where the drivers demanded action from the Ministry of Transportation who had promised to evaluate the tariffs that were set by these firms. Drivers felt that these tariffs should be handled on a provincial level as each provincial government has the autonomy to set its own minimum wages. One of the earliest demonstrations by Gojek drivers was back in 2015 when they protested in front of Gojek's first headquarter in Kemang, Jakarta, insisting that they meet Nadiem Makarim, co-founder and then-CEO, demanding for transparency in the incentive scheme. Drivers felt it was unfair that their pay was slashed for an inventory deposit they were not aware of such as the Gojek driver jacket that was initially lent to them on a rental mechanism but was eventually being billed to them.

Since its inception, Gojek has seen a number of large-scale demonstrations by its drivers. In June 2021, just a few days before the official merger of Gojek and Tokopedia, Gojek drivers announced that they were going on a three-day strike due to a change in GoKilat's (Gojek's courier service vertical) incentive scheme, resulting in significantly reduced tariff for the drivers. As part of the resistance, the drivers planned not to accept any GoKilat orders in Greater Jakarta and Bandung. A protest happened again in August 2024, the drivers in their demonstration demanded humane working conditions, decent wages, and recognition of legal status. They demanded the government and online transportation companies legalize the status of the driver profession in the law. In addition, they also demanded that the application company lower the cut of their earnings. They went on strike on 29 August by making their services unavailable the whole day, and stormed Gojek, Grab, and the Ministry of Communication and Information offices. Gojek responded by ensuring that the public can still use their application services despite the demonstration by drivers on Thursday. It is also open to listening to the aspirations of the company's partners. However, Gojek did not provide an explanation regarding the income formula for the drivers.
