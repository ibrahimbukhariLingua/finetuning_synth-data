John H. Johnson was CEO from February 2011 until February 2012, formerly employed by Imclone Systems.

Savient declared bankruptcy in 2013. The drug was selling at $5,390 per vial—around $30,000 for a three-month course of treatment—at the time Savient went under.

Savient was then bought by Crealta. In 2015, Crealta was able to sell the asset to Horizon Pharma for $510 million that year.
