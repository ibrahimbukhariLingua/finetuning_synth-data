Premio Tiepolo


# Premio Tiepolo



Created in 1996 by the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for Spain (CCIS) the **Premio Tiepolo** is an award conferred every year to both an Italian and a Spanish personality who have been particularly distinguished for their contribution to the integration and development of the economic-trade relations between Italy and Spain. The award is decided by a jury composed of Spanish journalists and Italian news correspondents located in Spain.

The name of the prize comes from the Italian painter, Lorenzo Tiepolo, who spent much of his life in Madrid, where he completed several frescoes for the Royal Palace and died in 1770. The first edition of the *Premio Tiepolo* was celebrated in 1996 at the Italian Embassy in Madrid. On that occasion the winners were Cesare Romiti, President of the Fiat Group and Isidoro Álvarez, President of El Corte Ingles.

The Premio Tiepolo award ceremony is organized by CCIS, located in Madrid, and since the year 2016 by the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE) of Madrid as well.
