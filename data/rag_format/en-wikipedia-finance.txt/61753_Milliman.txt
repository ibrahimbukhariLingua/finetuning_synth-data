## History

In the late 1940s, actuary Wendell Milliman started a consultancy in the Pacific Northwest. He was later joined by Stuart A. Robertson to establish Milliman & Robertson, Inc. The firm was initially centered mainly on assessing business risk and pension issues. In the retirement plan industry, Milliman provided services in actuarial consulting, consulting on compensation and care, retirement outsourcing, and others.

During the 1950s, Milliman & Robertson established the first health insurance benchmarking tool for the US healthcare market. During this time the company began expanding to other states and began offering other services, such as new forms of annuities, and employee benefit plans and pensions. The company’s first international office was opened in Tokyo during the 1990s, which was followed by international offices in several other foreign markets, and the first foreign insurance consulting assignment to be given in the People's Republic of China.


## Milliman indices

Milliman produces economic indexes for the American healthcare and insurance markets, including the Milliman 100 Pension Funding index. The Pension Funding Index examines the liabilities and assets of the top 100 pension funds in the US, establishing the funded status of the group overall. The company also releases an annual Milliman Medical Index, first published in 2001.
