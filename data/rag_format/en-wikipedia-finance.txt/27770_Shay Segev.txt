## Career

From 1994 to 1998, Segev worked as a computer engineer in the Israel Defense Forces, before joining software provider Comverse Technology in 1998 to manage the R&D for their mobile messaging applications.

Segev left Comverse in 2004 to become chief technology officer of Mercury Interactive, a software company developing business technology optimization solutions for the IT industry. In 2006, Segev joined Videobet, a subsidiary of gambling software company Playtech, as chief operating officer. Segev became chief operating officer of parent company Playtech in 2011 and CEO of its retail subsidiary. Segev joined the Gaming Standards Association as a board member at the same time.

In July 2015, Segev joined Gala Coral Group as chief strategy officer. In 2016, he joined GVC Holdings as COO to lead the merger between GVC and bwin.party. Segev is credited with finding €125 million in cost synergies, transforming the business and returning it to growth.

In March 2018, GVC Holdings acquired Ladbrokes Coral, Segev's former company, and was responsible for the integration of the two businesses.

In 2018, Segev was instrumental in establishing the joint venture between MGM Resorts and GVC, as it was then. He joined the board of BetMGM (Roar) in this capacity.

In July 2020, Segev succeeded Kenny Alexander as CEO following his departure after thirteen years in the post. As CEO, Segev unveiled a new corporate identity, which saw the company change its name from GVC Holdings to Entain plc and unveil a new strategy centred on growth and sustainability.

In 2021, Entain's joint venture partner MGM Resorts tried to acquire Entain for $11 billion. The offer was rejected by Segev and the board on the basis that it "significantly undervalue[d] the company and its prospects".

In January 2021, it was announced that Segev will join DAZN, the OTT subscription video streaming service owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik, as co-CEO. DAZN chairman John Skipper said Segev will bring "vast technology and operations experience to the role as well as an impressive track record in digital transformation". DAZN was described by the *Evening Standard* as one of the United Kingdom's few tech "unicorns". In January 2022, Segev was appointed the sole CEO of DAZN.

In September 2022, Segev announced that DAZN would acquire ELEVEN Sports and Team Whistle.
