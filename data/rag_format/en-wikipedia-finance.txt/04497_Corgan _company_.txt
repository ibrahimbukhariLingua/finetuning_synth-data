## History

In this period, Corgan designed and completed over 90 movie theaters, some of which remain operational or have undergone adaptive reuse, serving as historic landmarks.

In 1956, Corgan was selected to design the Dallas Love Field Airport Terminal, which was the primary airport for Dallas at the time and Corgan's first major commercial project. Their plans for the terminal included features, such as a mezzanine dining room and moving walkways for airline passengers, which were considered innovative concepts at the time.
