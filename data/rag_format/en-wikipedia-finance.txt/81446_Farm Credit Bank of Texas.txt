Farm Credit Bank of Texas


# Farm Credit Bank of Texas




**Farm Credit Bank of Texas**, part of the US Farm Credit System, serves as a wholesale lender and business-service provider to 13 local borrower-owned Farm Credit associations in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas.

Farm Credit Bank of Texas is a federated cooperative owned by the local Farm Credit association cooperatives, which directly finance rural real estate, agricultural production, country homes and agribusiness firms. Together with the other three banks of the Farm Credit System (AgFirst Farm Credit Bank, Columbia, South Carolina; AgriBank FCB, St. Paul, Minnesota; and CoBank, ACB, Denver, Colorado), the bank generates funds from the issuance of debt securities in the national and international financial markets through the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, a joint subsidiary of the banks of the Farm Credit System. These debt securities are the joint and several liabilities of the banks of the Farm Credit System and are neither guaranteed by the federal government nor backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. The Farm Credit Insurance Fund is available to protect investors in Farm Credit System debt securities.
