**Arada** is a property development company based in Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, with additional operations in Australia


## History

Arada is a privately held property development company, based in the United Arab Emirates, with an initial focus on the emirate of Sharjah. The company was founded in 2017 by Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, chairman of Basma Group, and Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed bin Talal Alsaud, chairman of KBW Investments.

Arada has so far launched projects valued at AED60 billion in both Dubai and Sharjah

As well as developing residential and mixed-use communities, Arada has also launched a portfolio of supporting brands. These include Wellfit, which operates gyms in Dubai and Sharjah; Zad, a food truck park concept; Manbat, a partnership with the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment that operates Emirati farmers’ markets and shops; and Artal, an Emirati fashion brand. Arada also signed its first master franchise agreement with Australia's Boost Juice in 2023.

In May 2022, Arada was assigned credit ratings by Fitch and Moody’s, and issued its debut $500 million sukuk in the same year. In 2024, the company established a $1 billion sukuk programme, raising an initial $400 million from the programme in June.

In August 2024, Arada announced its first expansion outside the UAE into Sydney. The company has invested AU$200 million on five initial sites in New South Wales, with its first project set to be based in the Sydney suburb of Castle Hill.

In December 2024, Arada acquired three prominent gym brands in the UAE, positioning itself as a leading operator in the country's fitness, sports, and wellness sector. The brands—FitnGlam, The Platform Studios, and Fitcode—will be integrated into Arada's existing fitness division, which currently includes six Wellfit-branded fitness clubs in Dubai and Sharjah. George Flooks was appointed as CEO of the fitness division, bringing extensive experience from managing large fitness chains.

The company secured another AED 1 billion in financing in 2019 with further funding valued at AED 337 million and AED 250 million finalised in 2021.

In April 2018, Arada signed a deal with Emaar Properties Hospitality Group to open three hotels in Aljada.
