Tuscan florin


# Tuscan florin



The **Tuscan fiorino** (plural: *fiorini*) was the currency of Tuscany between 1826 and 1859. It was subdivided into 100 **quattrini** (singular: *quattrino*), a local currency made by four **denari** (from the Latin: *quater denarii*). There was an additional denomination called the **paolo**, worth 40 quattrini, in circulation.


## History

During the Napoleonic Wars, Tuscany was annexed by France and the French franc was introduced, together with its satellite Italian lira. The previous lira did not disappear, creating a big confusion between the old Tuscan lira and the new Italian lira. So, when Duke Leopold II rose to power in 1824, he decided to introduce a new basic currency. The fiorino replaced the Tuscan lira at a rate of 1+2⁄3 lire = 1 fiorino. In 1847, Tuscany absorbed Lucca and the fiorino replaced the Luccan lira at a rate of 1 fiorino = 2 lire. After a brief revolutionary coinage, the fiorino was replaced in 1859 by a provisional currency denominated in "Italian lira", equal to the Sardinian lira, with 1 fiorino = 1.4 Italian lire.


### Coins

Copper coins were struck in denominations of 1 and 3 quattrini, together with billon 5 and 10 quattrini, silver 1⁄2, 1 and 5 paolo, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1 and 4 fiorini. Gold coins included the sequin (Italian: *zecchino*), *ruspone* and 80 fiorini, the latter two equalled 3 and 10 sequins respectively.
