## History

The group traces its beginnings in 1821 when Martial Henri Noël bought 40 hectares (100 acres) of agricultural land from his siblings. In 1827, he purchased an additional 89 hectares (220 acres) and built the Mon Desert sugar factory.

In 1882, the Noël family invested in the Savannah sugar estate in the south of the island, giving them access to another 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of land.

Espitalier-Noël Ltd was incorporated in 1944 as a holding company to administer its two sugar estates. In 1966, it participated in the creation of the Food and Allied Group (of which ENL Investment still holds 49%).

In 1969, Espitalier Noel Ltd created the General Investment and Development Company Ltd (GIDC – now ENL Commercial) to invest in non-sugar related activities.

The company's predecessors (Savannah and Mon Desert Alma sugar estates and GIDC) were among the first companies listed on the newly created Mauritius Stock Exchange in 1989.
