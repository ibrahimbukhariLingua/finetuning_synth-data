# Paul Zane Pilzer



**Paul Zane Pilzer** (born January 17, 1954) is an American economist, *New York Times* best-selling author, and social entrepreneur. He has written 13 books, the founder of six companies, and has been profiled in more than 100 publications including on the front page of *The Wall Street Journal*.


## Economic viewpoints

Pilzer's 1991 book *Unlimited Wealth* criticized traditional economic theories as being based on scarcity: that the earth contains a fixed, limited supply of resources and the function of economics (i.e., capitalism, socialism, communism) is to best divide them up. "No wonder," said Pilzer in *Unlimited Wealth*, "they call economics the 'Dismal Science.'" In contrast, Pilzer offered a new theory called Economic Alchemy based on abundance: that the earth contains unlimited resources because of human ingenuity continually defining new resources and/or learning how to better obtain and use our existing resources. The central equation of Economic Alchemy is W = P x Tⁿ : Wealth = Physical Resources times Technology, and T (Technology) has an exponential multiplier effect on itself.

Pilzer began developing Economic Alchemy in 1975 as a graduate student at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania when he theologically could not accept his professor's views that God had created a world of growing population but limited resources. Over the next 15 years, he developed Economic Alchemy while working at Citibank (1976–1981), and served as an appointed economic advisor in Ronald Reagan's Presidential Administration (1983–1988).

Pilzer published his theory of Economic Alchemy in *Unlimited Wealth – The Theory and Practice of Economic Alchemy* (Crown Publishers, 1990) and in *God Wants You To Be Rich – Theology of Economics* (Simon & Schuster, 1995, 1997, 2007).

Pilzer has also written about employment, U.S. health benefits, wellness and the sharing economy. In 1985, he testified before a United States congressional hearing and since then has promoted the idea that employees should have personal and portable health insurance coverage independent of their employment but funded pre-tax by their employer. In 1996, he began researching the bifurcation of America based on weight and health. From 1999 to 2014 wrote five books on the economics of obesity, health insurance, preventative medicine, and wellness.

Pilzer has been called the "father of Health Savings Accounts". In 2003, the front page of the *Sunday New York Times* referred to Pilzer as "the Reagan administration economist turned wellness guru."

Pilzer is currently researching The Sharing Revolution, Consumer Surplus, Gross National Happiness, Universal Basic Income and the impact of the Russian and Chinese economies on the world economy 2023-2033. "While the sharing economy is about using technology to halve the price of what you want to buy," says Pilzer, "the sharing revolution is about doubling the value of what you already own or are about to buy. As explained in Pilzer's *The New Roaring Twenties 2023-2033* (BenBella Books, 2023) Uber and Airbnb aren't just half the price of the services (taxis and hotels) they displace, to the consumer they are twice as valuable with up to 100% Consumer Surplus."
