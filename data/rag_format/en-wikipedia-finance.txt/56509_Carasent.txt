## History

Apptix was founded in 1997 after being spun off from TeleComputing ASA, of Oslo, Norway. The company is headquartered in Herndon, Virginia, USA, with additional locations in Florida and Texas. Apptix is publicly traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE: APP). Apptix has acquired and integrated other hosted Exchange vendors ASP-One, Mi8, and Mailstreet.

In 2011, revenues totaled US$40.7 million, up 5% from $38.6 million in 2010. Positive net income trends have continued for the first three quarters of 2012.

In 2020, medical device vendor Zoll sued Barracuda Networks, an IT firm that provided software and services to Apptix, which in turn provided secure storage of patients' personal information to Zoll. Zoll sued the IT firm after a server migration error compromised the personal and medical data of patients. In 2021, a federal judge in Massachusetts dismissed the allegations of Zoll Medical Corp against Barracuda Networks.
