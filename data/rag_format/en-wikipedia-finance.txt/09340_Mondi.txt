## History

Mondi has its roots in South Africa where, in 1967, the company's former owner, Anglo American plc, built the Merebank Mill in Durban.

In 2000, the company increased its holdings in Neusiedler AG and Frantschach AG, both Austrian businesses, to 100% and 70% respectively. Also in 2000, it acquired Cofinec, a Polish business. It increased its holding in the Syktyvkar Mill in the Komi Republic to 90% in 2002.

In 2004 Mondi further increased its holdings in Frantschach *AG*, one of its Austrian businesses, to 100% and in Celuloza Świecie *AG*, another Polish business, to 71% (and then changed its name to Mondi Packaging Paper Świecie).

On 2 July 2007 the company demerged from its former parent company Anglo American plc, and became a dual-listed company, with Mondi Limited listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Mondi plc listed on the London Stock Exchange.

In 2011, Mondi demerged Mondi Packaging South Africa (listed as Mpact on Johannesburg Stock Exchange).

In 2012, Mondi acquired Nordenia to extend its consumer packaging business.

In May 2017, Peter Oswald was appointed as the new group chief executive officer. In the same year, the approval of the €335 million Štětí mill modernisation (Czech Republic) happened.

In 2019, Mondi completed the simplification of its corporate structure from dual listed into a single holding company under Mondi plc.

On 1 April 2020, Andrew King succeeded Peter Oswald as Mondi Group's chief executive officer.

On 4 May 2022, Mondi announced plans to divest from its Russian assets. However, in December 2022, *The Times* reported than the sale of its Russian assets was "still awaiting approval". In February 2023 Mondi was added to Ukraine International Sponsors of War list. Mondi temporarily abandoned its stated intention of selling its most significant asset in Russia, the Syktyvkar Pulp and Paper Mill, to a company owned by Viktor Kharitonin, due to lack of progress with the necessary approvals, in June 2023. However, in September 2023, the sale was completed and Mondi confirmed that it no longer trades in Russia.

In January 2023, it was announced Mondi had completed the acquisition of the Duino paper mill from the Italian graphic and speciality paper company, Burgo Group for €40 million.

In March 2024, the company made an agreed offer worth £5.1 billion to acquire DS Smith.
