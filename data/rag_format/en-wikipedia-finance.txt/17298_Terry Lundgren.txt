## Early life

Born in Long Beach, California, Lundgren was one of six children. He was the only member of the six that went to college because of his parents' limited financial capacity. His parents stopped paying for his tuition, seeing Lundgren did not have good grades. In response, Lundgren "found a job at a local restaurant in Tucson, where he was responsible for cracking oysters and peeling shrimp." He was eventually "promoted to a waiter, then the head waiter, and then the head manager of the restaurant." Through his job, he was able to graduate from the University of Arizona.

The company reported that of its top 15 best-performing geographic markets in the key holiday selling month of December 2008, 13 were My Macy's pilot districts. The My Macy's organizational model was then rolled out across the U.S. in 2009 and became a Harvard Business School case study for successful localization within a national retailing model.

Lundgren also led Macy's significant investments in ecommerce and mobile shopping, which led it to become one of the largest online retailers in America. Under Lundgren, Macy's, Inc. acquired beauty retailer Bluemercury in 2015.
