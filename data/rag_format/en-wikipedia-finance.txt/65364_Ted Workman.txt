## Montreal Alouettes

Workman purchased controlling interest in the Montreal Alouettes in 1954 with minority owner Léo Dandurand remaining as team president. Workman replaced Dandurand as team president after the 1957 season and in 1965, he took on the additional responsibility of general manager. The Alouettes had a 50-71-5 record during Workman's tenure as team president and never finished above third place in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union/Eastern Football Conference. He stepped down as team president in 1966, but remained the Alouettes principal owner until he was bought out by Joe Atwell in 1967.

On February 23, 1967, Workman was named interim commissioner of the Canadian Football League. He was replaced by Allan McEachern before the end of the year.
