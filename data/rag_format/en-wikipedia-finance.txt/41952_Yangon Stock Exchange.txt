The **Yangon Stock Exchange** (Burmese: ရန်ကုန်စတော့အိတ်ချိန်း; abbreviated **YSX**) opened in December 2015, at the former Central Bank of Myanmar and Myawaddy Bank headquarters in Yangon. On 23 December 2014, two Japanese firms, Daiwa Institute of Research, the research arm of Daiwa Securities Group and Japan Exchange Group, established a joint venture with the state-owned Myanma Economic Bank to establish this stock exchange. The joint venture firm, the Yangon Stock Exchange-Joint Venture Limited will have a working capital of US$31 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has selected Kanbawza Bank to be YSX' settlement bank.


## Building history

The YSX building, located on the corner of Sule Pagoda Road and Merchant Street, formerly housed the Central Bank of Myanmar. The neoclassical structure was designed by G Douglas Smart, and opened in 1939, as the Rangon branch of the Reserve Bank of India, and managed British Burma's financial system, even after its separation from British India in 1937.

Following monetary independence from Britain, the building became home to the Union Bank of Burma (ပြည်တောင်စုဘဏ်), and the first Burmese kyats were issued there in July 1952. It remained the site of Myanmar's central bank until 1993, when it became occupied by the military-owned Myawaddy Bank.
