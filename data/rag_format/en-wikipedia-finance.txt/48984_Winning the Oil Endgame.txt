Winning the Oil Endgame


# Winning the Oil Endgame



***Winning the Oil Endgame: Innovation for Profits, Jobs and Security*** is a 2005 book by Amory B. Lovins, E. Kyle Datta, Odd-Even Bustnes, Jonathan G. Koomey, and Nathan J. Glasgow, published by the Rocky Mountain Institute. It presents an independent, transdisciplinary analysis of four ways to reduce petroleum dependence in the United States:

* Using oil more efficiently, through smarter technologies that wring more (and often better) services from less oil (pp. 29–102).
* Substituting for petroleum fuels other liquids made from biomass or wastes (pp. 103–111).
* Substituting saved natural gas for oil in uses where they’re interchangeable, such as furnaces and boilers (pp. 111–122).
* Replacing oil with hydrogen made from non-oil resources (pp. 228–242).

## Problems and solutions

The authors explain that the problems of oil dependence are manageable, suggesting that oil dependence is a problem we need no longer have. The proposed solutions to oil dependence are profitable and U.S. oil dependence can be eliminated by proven and attractive technologies that create wealth, enhance choice, and strengthen common security. The authors argue that America can lead the world into the post-petroleum era and create a vibrant economy. (p.xiii)


## Reviews

*Winning the Oil Endgame* has received many positive reviews and the Wall Street Journal called the book "Perhaps the most rigorous and surely the most dramatic analysis of what it will take to wean us from foreign oil ... carried out by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a respected center of hard-headed, market-based research."
