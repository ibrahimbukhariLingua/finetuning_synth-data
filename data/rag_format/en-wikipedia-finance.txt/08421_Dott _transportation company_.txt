## History

Dott was founded in September 2019 by the French Henri Moissinac and Maxim Romain. It had its Series A round of funding in 2019, raising €30 million led by EQT Ventures and Naspers; this was followed by a Series B round in April for $85 million, led by Sofina.

The company was selected along with companies TIER and Lime to participate in a year-long trial of the use of e-scooters as a method of transportation in London. It will deploy up to 6,600 scooters there during the course of the trial, which will be available for rental use via an app.

In 2024 they announced a merger with TIER Mobility. The deal was closed on March 25th of 2024. The merger ended up to use TIER's corporate entity as the legal entity and the legal HQ moving to Berlin from Amsterdam.
