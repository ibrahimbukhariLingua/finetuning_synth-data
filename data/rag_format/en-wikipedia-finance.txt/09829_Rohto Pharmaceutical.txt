## History

Yasutami Yamada (山田 安民) founded "Japanese: 信天堂山田安民薬房, lit. 'Shintendo Yamada Yasutami Pharmacy'" in Osaka, on February 22, 1899. ROHTO Pharmaceutical Co. is the largest company in Japan's OTC drugs market, commanding a 40% share in the eye-drop sector. The name "Rohto" was inspired by August von Rothmund, a German ophthalmologist who was a professor for Toyotaro Inoue (井上 豊太郎, *Inoue Toyotarō*), a Japanese ophthalmologist.
