SGBL offers a range of banking services to individuals and companies.


## Société Générale (France) holding

In 2020, local reports verified that Société Générale (France) did not divest from its holding in SGBL after an allegation that SGBL is a "troubled and mismanaged bank." Société Générale (France) had set aside provisions to compensate for the downgrade in Lebanon's credit rating for the previous fiscal year because the downgrade caused a decrease in the value of its holding in SGBL.


## Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development

Corporate social responsibility and sustainable development have been an integral part of SGBL’s identity and they are based on four pillars: sports, culture, society and economic growth.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
