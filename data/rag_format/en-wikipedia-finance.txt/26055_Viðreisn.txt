# Viðreisn



**Viðreisn** (lit. 'Revival', 'Reform', or 'Regeneration'), officially known in English as the **Liberal Reform Party**, is a liberal political party in Iceland positioned on the centre to centre-right of the political spectrum. The party was founded on 24 May 2016 but it had existed as a political network since June 2014. It split from the Independence Party, mainly over discontent with its decision to not hold a referendum on joining the European Union and the lack of support for free trade.

The party supports Icelandic EU membership, and reform of agricultural subsidies and protective excise taxes on foreign produce. Viðreisn is in favor of a publicly financed welfare state. It supports pegging the króna to another currency, such as the euro, through a currency board as a plan to lower interest rates. Its healthcare policy aims at reducing the patient's share of healthcare costs.

Viðreisn has been assigned the list letter C. It participated in the 2016 elections to the Althing (Icelandic parliament) and won seven seats.
