ITHINK Financial Amphitheatre


# ITHINK Financial Amphitheatre



The **iTHINK Financial Amphitheatre** is a 20,000-seat open-air (Approx. 8,000 seats under cover and approx. 12,000 lawn seats) music venue in West Palm Beach, Florida. The facility, owned by the South Florida Fairgrounds, is a modern amphitheatre used primarily for concerts and other performances. The loading dock and backstage area is sometimes used for concerts that are general admission standing room only (mostly heavy metal concerts), while the amphitheatre stage is used as the backstage area in these situations.


## History

The venue opened on April 26, 1996. Since opening, the venue has gone through numerous name changes; it is the amphitheatre that has had the most name changes in the United States.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It was initially named **Coral Sky Amphitheatre** because the seats face into the west, often in view of a colorful sunset. The venue was renamed to **Mars Music Amphitheatre** on January 6, 2000, named after the music store chain Mars Music. However, Mars Music filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002, and in August 2002 the venue reverted to its previous name. It then changed again when Sound Advice became the new sponsor, and was renamed **Sound Advice Amphitheatre** on June 1, 2003. In early 2008, the venue was renamed again following a new sponsorship agreement with Cruzan Rum, becoming the **Cruzan Amphitheatre** on February 1, 2008. On February 11, 2015, the venue reverted to its original name, the **Coral Sky Amphitheatre**, while owners looked for a new sponsor. In June, the venue succeeded in securing a new sponsorship with Perfect Vodka, and it was renamed to the **Perfect Vodka Amphitheatre at the South Florida Fairgrounds**. Its name reverted again to **Coral Sky Amphiteatre** on August 4, 2017. On January 16, 2020, the name was changed to **iTHINK Financial Amphitheatre**, after a sponsorship deal with iTHINK Financial Credit Union.
