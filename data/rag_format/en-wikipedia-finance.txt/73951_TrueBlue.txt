TrueBlue


# TrueBlue



**TrueBlue** is the frequent-flyer program of JetBlue that offers points to passengers traveling on most fare types, as well as to consumers who utilize JetBlue co-branded credit cards.


## History

JetBlue launched TrueBlue in 2008. Under the original TrueBlue program, flights were worth two, four, or six points based on distance of the flights, and double points were awarded for flights booked online.

In September 2009, JetBlue made changes to its TrueBlue program. In the new program, members receive three points for every dollar spent toward a flight, excluding taxes and fees, plus an additional three points for every dollar spent on a flight if booked online directly on the JetBlue.com website. Additional points are awarded if the member uses the Barclay's issued JetBlue Mastercard credit card to purchase the flight. The price of flights in points depend on the fare of the flight in U.S. dollars.

The new program launched on November 9, 2009.

In June 2013, JetBlue announced that TrueBlue points will never expire for any reason.

TrueBlue points average a value of 1.24 Â¢.
