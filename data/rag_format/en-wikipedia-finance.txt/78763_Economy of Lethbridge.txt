Economy of Lethbridge


# Economy of Lethbridge



The **economy of Lethbridge** is central to the commercial, distribution, financial and industrial sectors of the southern Alberta economy (although Medicine Hat plays a significant role in southeastern Alberta). Lethbridge has a trading area population of 250,000 (including parts of British Columbia and Montana). The city was founded in 1885 as a result of local coal mining and later was buoyed by local farming and ranching. Toward the end of the twentieth century, the local economy started diversifying by focusing more on service-based industries.


## Economic development

In 2004, the municipal government organised **Economic Development Lethbridge**, a body responsible for the promotion and development of the city's commercial interests. Also in that year, the city joined in a partnership with 24 other local communities to create an economic development alliance called *SouthGrow*, representing a population of over 140,000.

In 2006, Economic Development Lethbridge partnered with SouthGrow Regional Initiative
and *Alberta SouthWest Regional Alliance* to create the *Southern Alberta Alternative Energy Partnership*. This partnership is responsible for the development and attraction of alternative energy business, including wind power, solar power and biofuel.


## Head offices

Lethbridge has been the home of several national companies over the years. From its founding in 1935, Canadian Freightways was based in Lethbridge until moving its operations to Calgary in 1948; its call centre remains in Lethbridge. Taco Time Canada was based in the city from 1978–1995 before moving to Calgary. Minute Muffler, which began in 1969, is based out of Lethbridge. International shipping company H & R Transport has been based in the city since 1955. Braman Furniture, which also has locations in Manitoba and Ontario, has been headquartered in Lethbridge since 1991. Lethbridge Iron Works has been in the city since 1898.
