# Mongolian Bankers Association



The **Mongolian Bankers Association** (**MBA**) is an independent, non-profit, and non-government organization under which the banking and non-banking financial institutions officially licensed to operate within the territory of Mongolia are unified. The role of the MBA is to represent the interests of the banking sector and serve its members as a sounding board for policy discussions.

With 36 members, the association integrates all 12 commercial banks, a development bank, representative offices of foreign banks, financial sector infrastructure organizations, and fintech companies.

Considerable efforts were made to amplify cooperation with other international banking associations, namely the Asian Bankers Association, the Korea Federation of Banks, the Association of Russian Banks, and the Uzbekistan Banking Association, as well as with international financial institutions.

Furthermore, to facilitate and leverage the financial development of Mongolia, it has initiated and established the Banking and Finance Academy, the Credit Information Bureau, the Mongolian Mortgage Corporation, the Mongolian Green Finance Corporation, and the Billion Tree Fund in cooperation with its members.

## Professional councils

As a professional industry association and a union of bankers and financial experts, MBA has established several professional councils. These councils enable staff and subject experts from member organizations to have regular meetings to share their knowledge and experiences, and to discuss current banking and financial sector updates.

MBA's daily work and policy positions, recommendations, and supervisory document reviews are guided by the input of member bankers who serve on 15 professional councils in all areas of banking.

In addition to close collaborations among professional council members, these councils make valuable expert opinions to the MBA Board of Directors on sector-specific concerns, public-private joint discussions, advocacy papers, and other activities.

To amplify the status as a professional association for banking and financial professionals, the risk management, legal, human resource, special asset management, marketing, and fintech expert consultants' councils were set up by the secretariat of the association. The MBA secretariat, chaired by the chief executive and secretary-general, coordinates the daily operation of the association in conformity with the resolutions, decisions, and directions of the board of directors.
