International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation


# International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation



**International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation (ILLF)** was a government authorised and state controlled charitable foundation that operated Internet lotteries. The foundation pioneered Internet gaming, having launched the web's first online lottery, PLUS Lotto, in 1995 and processed the first online gaming transaction ever. It supported charitable causes in Liechtenstein, many of which support projects in poorer nations internationally. ILLF filed for bankruptcy in September 2011.


## Chronology

In early 1995, executives of London Mall, a British software developer conceived the idea of an Internet lottery. A license to run a fixed odds Internet lottery, without international marketing restrictions, was obtained from the Liechtenstein government. The International Lottery in Liechtenstein Foundation (ILLF), a charitable foundation, was formed to operate this lottery, then called Interlotto. It also introduced the first instant scratchcard games on the Internet during this time.

The first Interlotto ticket was sold to Mario Frick, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein (December 15, 1993 - April 5, 2001). The first Interlotto draw took place at the Köfferli bar in the quaint capital of Vaduz, Liechtenstein on the Saturday evening of 7 October 1995. Caroline Burdet, Liechtenstein's first Olympic bobsledder, drew the winning six numbers for what is billed as the first nationally sanctioned lottery on the Internet.

Fourteen months later, on 13 January 1997 the lottery site was renamed from Interlotto to PLUS Lotto following an agreement with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), one of the world's best known and most respected humanitarian organisations, whereby the IFRC would become its major beneficiary. The first draw under the PLUS Lotto name took place on 18 April 1997.


## Regulation

ILLF was licensed by the government of Liechtenstein to operate its lotteries. The license was highly regulated, with government appointed auditors (Thöny Treuhand AG, Vaduz) auditing the ILLF books of account and overseeing all aspects of the operations including scrutinization of lottery pre-draw and draw procedures. This includes all lottery games as well as the instant win games.

ILLF's partners were credible and well known:

Thawte certified the ILLF sites to guarantee personal information such as credit card details is protected and securely processed.

The larger Jackpot prizes were insured through R K Harrison Group Limited, a Lloyd's broker, to ensure guaranteed Jackpot prize payouts.

Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG held the player funds from transactions made on all the ILLF operated sites to assure funds were securely held and paid out to players. Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG, a AAA rated bank, is predominately owned by the Principality of Liechtenstein.


## Charity

An integral part of ILLF was its focus on charities. All the lottery sites in the ILLF network set aside a portion of revenue to fund causes in Liechtenstein and around the world. All donations are made at the discretion of the Charity Allocation Committee which is controlled by the Liechtenstein government.


## ILLF Network

ILLF operated many websites, referred to as the ILLF brands. Combined, these brands offered a wide array of games to choose from.

* World Lotto Corporation
* Lotto.li
* PLUS Lotto

All sites now redirect to the main ILLF home page, discussing the reasons for the filing of bankruptcy.


## Games

Several games operated under the ILLF brands:

* Lotteries
* Instant Win Games
* Scratchcards

### Lotteries

ILLF offered two weekly lotteries and one monthly lottery.


#### Weekly 6/49 Lottery

In every lotto draw, six numbers plus one bonus number were drawn from a range of balls numbered 1 to 49. Players choose six different numbers plus a bonus number by a method of their own choosing. Prizes were awarded for matching two, three, four, five or six numbers as well as five plus the bonus ball and six plus the bonus ball.

#### Draw

The 6/49 lottery draw was conducted every Friday at ILLF's studio in Liechtenstein and is scrutinized by an auditor from Thöny Treuhand AG, Vaduz. Draws were performed using one of two mechanical ball machines manufactured by Editec (France). Prior to the draw a ball set was selected at random and test draws were carried out to ensure that the machine and ball sets have not been tampered with. After the draw an independent program is run by the auditor and the results compared to the database to verify that the data is correct and there are no errors. The draw was filmed and then made available via the Internet.

The Prize Pool for the 6/49 lottery draw was 90% of the value of the ticket price. The allocation is as follows:

* 2% for a 6 number match, plus bonus ball
* 8% for a 6 number match
* 10% for promotional incentive prizes
* on average 2% for a 5 number match, plus bonus ball
* on average 4% for a 5 number match
* on average 7% for a 4 number match
* on average 30% for a 3 number match
* on average 37% for a 2 number match

#### Little Big One

Little Big One was a weekly lotto where 5 from 15 balls are drawn. Each ticket contains 5 numbers chosen from 15. There were a maximum of 3003 tickets available in every weekly draw. There were three prize categories to be won, including winning for matching zero balls. Since each ticket number is sold only once, winners do not share prizes. The Jackpot is a guaranteed EUR 2,003.00 per week. The weekly draw was an automated draw using a certified Random Number Generator. The draw took place in Liechtenstein every Wednesday at 11h00 CET but occasionally, due to a "Must be Won Jackpot" feature of the LBO game, could occur earlier.

The Prize Pool for the Little Big One draw was 80% of the ticket price. The allocation is as follows:

* 27.79% for a 5 number match
* 49.95% for a 3 number match
* 20.98% for a 0 number match
