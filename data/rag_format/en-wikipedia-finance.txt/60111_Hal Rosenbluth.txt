## Community Involvement & Philanthropy

In 1988, Rosenbluth discovered that the 1,200 person, small farming community of Linton, North Dakota, was struggling through one of the worst droughts the Midwest had seen at the time. He wanted to help the local community so he set up a temporary office and gave part-time jobs to some 40 people to make extra income for a few months. He was applauded and credited with saving Linton.

Impressed by their dedication and productivity, Rosenbluth made these jobs permanent, creating a substantial workforce in Linton. Over the years, Rosenbluth International expanded in North Dakota, and in April 2000, was one of the state's largest private employers.

After 1988, further companies moved into North Dakota and Duke Rosendahl, then-economic development official for Hazen, North Dakota, credited Rosenbluth, telling *The Wall Street Journal* at the time, “Had it not been for Hal, these companies wouldn't even know North Dakota exists.”

As of January 2024, Rosenbluth is a board member of the Herb it Forward Foundation.
