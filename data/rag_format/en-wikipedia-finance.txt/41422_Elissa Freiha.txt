**Elissa Freiha** (Arabic: إليسا فريحة; born 1989 or 1990 (age 33–34)) is an Emirati-Lebanese-American businesswoman, entrepreneur, investor, executive producer, and feminist activist. She is the founder of Womena, a female-focused media company which aims to inspire real change through storytelling and digital content. Womena launched in 2014 as an angel-investment network which aimed to economically empower women by educating them on early-stage venture capital investment and facilitating the process of women angel investors investing in new MENA-based startups. However, in 2018, Freiha pivoted the business towards creating a wider impact for women of the region and reimagined Womena as the storytelling platform it is today. In 2018 Freiha and Womena also launched Womentum, a tech accelerator and documentary series for female-led start-ups in the Middle East.

In July 2021 Freiha was appointed as a Board Member to the Dubai Chamber of Digital Economy.
