Langley is the owner of Langley Holdings, an engineering group based in Retford, Nottinghamshire, England. The group currently has over 90 trading subsidiaries and employs around 5,000+ people world wide, the majority at its factories in Norway, Germany, France and Italy.

Langley started the business in 1975, out of the ruins of his dissolved family business, aged just 21. In 2000, Langley bought Clarke Chapman, and sales reached $75 million. This gave means to the growth of Langley's company, and the portfolio grew to an estimated $1 billion revenue by 2015, largely by acquiring and turning around under-performing engineering businesses.

In August 2021 Langley Holdings announced that it had entered into an Agreement with Rolls-Royce PLC to acquire Bergen Engines AS in Norway. The company employs 960 people world wide, of which approximately 650 are in Norway. The Bergen Engines deal was completed on 31 December, and is expected to boost Langley group revenues by over $300 million in 2022 to around $1.5 billion annually.
