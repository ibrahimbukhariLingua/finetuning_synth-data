In 1999, Boyko was a joint investor in EvrazHolding alongside Alexander Abramov, combining three steel mills and thereby creating one of the world's largest vertically-integrated steel producers as a result. In 2004, Boyko sold his 25% stake in EvrazHolding for approximately $600 to $700 million prior to its listing on the London Stock Exchange.
In 2002, Boyko founded Ritzio Entertainment Group, investing in casinos and gaming, a business that expanded across Russia before going internationally.

## Business interests

Oleg Boyko’s current focus is on the digital financial services, fintech and financial technology sectors, strengthened by his extensive banking experience.
According to Boyko, the fintech industry is "the biggest blue ocean" in the business world, with products and services designed for individuals who do not have access to traditional financial services and those who are underserved by mainstream banks.
Boyko, therefore, continues to expand and strengthen his activities in technology-based, data-driven transformational financial services platforms and business alternatives to the conventional banking sector. Boyko is determined to take advantage of changes in global consumer behaviour, advances in technology and data science, and harness the growing power and availability of mobile devices, in order to offer an alternative banking option to those consumers who do not have access to traditional financial services and banks.

Finstar's investment portfolio included, among others, Vivus Mexico, 4Finance, Spotcap, an online lending platform for SMEs, Prestamos Prima, an online consumer financial services provider, and Viventor, a peer-to-peer lending platform.
In 2017 Oleg Boyko announced his intention to invest $150 million into fintech businesses and in-house R&D within portfolio companies. The first phase of a global fintech investment plan is under way with a commitment to invest up to $50 million in Asia-Pacific`s consumer lending.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Other

According to a Gordonua.com article from 2020, Otari Arshba (Russian: Отари Ионович Аршба) allegedly recruited Boyko into the KGB and, while Boyko was at the computer center of Moscow State University from 1982 to 1986, Boyko excelled as an KGB agent and was subsequently sent on business trips to Great Britain and the United States. However, in 2019, the Latvian court ruled that this information was false and defamatory to the individual.

Boyko founded the Parasport foundation in 2006, during the Paralympic Winter Games in Turin. The Foundation offers funding for Paralympic athletes to train and attend competitions and obtain physical and mental health care, and promotes equality for people with disabilities.

In December 2021, Oleg Boyko pursued through the Moscow court an order for Google to remove the search results for a site that, he claims, contains misleading information.
