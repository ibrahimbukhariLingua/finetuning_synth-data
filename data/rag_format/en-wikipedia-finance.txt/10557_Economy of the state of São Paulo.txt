## Agriculture

The main characteristics of farming in São Paulo are variety and quality. In 2017, the income generated by the sector in São Paulo corresponded to 10.14% of the national agricultural activity, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and the State Data Analysis System Foundation (Seade) – (2017)

The two main agricultural highlights in the state are sugar cane and orange. In 2019, São Paulo produced 425,617,093 tons of sugarcane. Production paulista is equivalent to 56.5% of Brazilian production of 752,895,389 tons, surpasses the production of India (2nd largest sugarcane producer in the world) in 2019 (which was 405,416,180 tons) and was equivalent to 21.85% of world production of cane in the same year (1,949,310,108 tons).

Swine farming in São Paulo faces problems that are difficult to solve, such as lack of scale in production, high production costs, competition with other more profitable agricultural activities and lack of cooperative aptitude, to name just a few. Added to these problems is competition for consumers who, when they have budgetary restrictions on purchasing food, choose chicken meat based on the price and, when they don't have it, choose beef based on preference. What results from these factors is the growing disincentive for pig farmers to remain in the activity in which production is insufficient and practically all consumed in the state itself.

This cycle lasted until the crash of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929. The decline of coffee farming causes the transfer of capital to industry, which was able to develop supported by the consumer market and the labor force available in the state. This first phase of industrialization takes place in the Brazilian economic context of import substitution.

The period of greatest growth of the industry in the state occurred during the mandate of Juscelino Kubitschek, who promoted the internationalization of the Brazilian economy, bringing to São Paulo (mainly the ABC) the industry automobile.
