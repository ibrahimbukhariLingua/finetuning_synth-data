Fetch Pet Insurance


# Fetch Pet Insurance



**Fetch** is a pet insurance provider, helping pet owners cover veterinary bills in the United States and Canada.


## History

Fetch was founded in September 2003 by husband and wife entrepreneurs Chris and Natasha Ashton after experiencing a high veterinary bill. In November 2003, Fetch Inc. was awarded the exclusive license for the Petplan brand in the United States. In July 2006, the company began selling its first policies, and started selling policies online later that year. The company formed partnerships with animal shelters, veterinarians, and health insurance providers to help sell 120,000 policies by 2014. The company launched *fetch!*, a glossy quarterly pet health magazine, in November 2008.

In 2019, Petplan hired Paul Guyardo as the new CEO. The same year it was acquired by private equity firm, Warburg Pincus. At the time, it had 200 employees and $130 million in annual sales. Since the acquisition, the company expanded into technology including a mobile app for communication and accessing insurance plans.

In 2020, The Dodo took a minority stake in Petplan, now known as Fetch, not to be confused with Petplan in Australia, which is now called Petcover. The rebranding was announced in 2022. More information about Petcover in Australia can be found at .
