## Production

Arun Kumar revealed that he initially wanted to produce the film but felt that only he could envision the tale correctly, and subsequently chose to direct the venture himself. While producing the film through the newly launched Arun Entertainments, he also sets up his own music company, Arun Music. He introduced newcomer, Chinni Charan, to be the composer and lyricist. The director recruited an ensemble cast of Jackie Shroff, Raghuvaran, Rahul Dev, Abbas and Veda to star. Shroff noted that Arun Kumar did not know how to speak English when he met him for the script narration, but was convinced to sign the film owing to the director's enthusiasm.

Production began during January 2007 and the film was mostly shot in Hyderabad and Mehaboob Studios in Mumbai. An audio soundtrack release event was held in Hyderabad during November 2007. The event was presided over by the Telugu Film Producers' Council President Tammareddy Bharadwaja.

## Release and reception

The film had a theatrical release on 30 January 2009. A critic from The Times of India gave the film one star out of five, and noted, "it remains a big question, how talented actors like Jackie Shroff and Raghuvaran could agree to do this lackluster film". The reviewer added, "on the face of it, a plot on bank robbery promises to be a nail-biting thriller, but the shoddy screenplay makes it a bad show".

The Tamil dubbed version of the film was released straight to DVD in 2012. The Hindi dubbed version of the film was scheduled to release in September 2008 after delays, but was not released.
