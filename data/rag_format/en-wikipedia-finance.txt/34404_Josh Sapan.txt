## Life and education

Sapan was born to a Jewish family in Queens, New York. His father worked in advertising, and his mother was an off-off-Broadway actress. Sapan was raised in Little Neck, Queens and attended P.S. 187. Sapan studied radio, television and film at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left school in 1970 moving to Boulder, Colorado and later Berkeley, California.

When he returned to college at UW-Madison, Sapan worked for a company that “four-walled” films, taking 35 mm prints of wilderness films to theaters in small towns in Wisconsin which had been rented by the film company. He also acted with the Broom Street Theatre in plays such as Bertolt Brechts “The Exception and the Rule”, and in what may have been the first staging of the rock opera "Tommy". He performed at Broom Street opposite André De Shields who would later go on to star in "The Wiz" on Broadway. During this time, he also began collecting a substantial number of classic film posters discarded by theaters in Wisconsin.

At UW-Madison, Sapan led two film societies: The New Utrecht film society and Thor Film Society, New Utrecht showed foreign and art films such as *Woman in the Dunes* and *The Bicycle Thief*, and Thor showed mainstream movies and college oriented fare, finding particular success with *Reefer Madness*.

The film society experience led Sapan to purchase two 16 mm projectors and establish a mobile movie exhibition business in the Midwest, operating out of Athens Ohio, known as The Court Street Theatre.

After graduating from UW-Madison in 1975, Sapan returned to New York City and worked various jobs including as a labor union organizer for Local 1114 in the nursing home and hospital industry, which was later subsumed into Local 1199.
