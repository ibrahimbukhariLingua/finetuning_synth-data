Albanian lek


# Albanian lek



The **lek** (Albanian: *leku shqiptar*; indefinite singular *lek*, definite plural *lekët*, indefinite plural *lekë*; sign: **L**; code: **ALL**) is the currency of Albania. Historically, it was subdivided into 100 *qintars* (Albanian: *qindarka*; singular *qindarkë*).


## History

The lek was introduced as the first Albanian currency in February 1926.

Before then, Albania was a country without a currency, adhering to a gold standard for the fixation of commercial values. Before the First World War, the Ottoman Turkish piastre was in full circulation. During the occupation of Albania by Austria-Hungary, paper notes of the Austro-Hungarian krone were imposed on the population. Albanians were reluctant to use these notes and only did so in exchanges with the occupiers. The majority of the population used gold and silver piastre or, gave up on money altogether and bartered instead. In 1923 Italian paper circulated at Shkodër, Durrës, Vlorë, and Gjirokastër, and the Greek drachma at Korçë, the values of which varied according to locality and the prevailing rates of exchange as compared with gold.


### Gold standard

From 1926–1939, the Albanian leke adhered to the gold standard *de jure* with leke banknotes being convertible to gold. The leke's conversion to gold was guaranteed and the issue of gold francs was limited to three million units. Due to the gold standard, up until 1939, the leke did not experience significant inflation and the currency in circulation remained relatively constant. Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the entire gold reserves of Albania, totaling 300,000 gold francs, were confiscated and sent to the Reichsbank in Berlin. This action, coupled with the introduction of the Italian lira in Albania, led to significant inflation and the devaluation of the leke.


### Etymology

The naming of this currency as "Lek" has two stories, one is that it is named after Alexander the Great, whose name is often shortened to *Leka* in Albanian. where Alexander's portrait appeared on the obverse of the 1 lek coin, while the reverse showed him on his horse. Meanwhile, the other is that this currency was named after Lekë Dukagjini, which is considered the official reason based on parliamentary discussions in the Parliament of Albania in 1922. The word *qindarkë* comes from the Albanian *qind*, meaning one hundred, or from Arabic *qintār* ("hundredweight"). The word is thus comparable to *centime*, cent, Latin *centenarius*, etc.


### Franga

Between 1926 and 1939, the main unit of Albanian currency was the *franga ari* (English: *gold franc*) (Fr.A.), worth 5 Lek and divided into 100 *qindar ar* (*gold cent*), used in international transactions. This unit was similar in concept to the *Belga*, a unit worth five Belgian francs.


## Coins


### First lek

In 1926, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 5 and 10 qintars, together with nickel 1⁄4 Lek, 1⁄2 Lek and 1 Lek, and silver Fr.A. 1, Fr.A. 2 and Fr.A. 5 . The obverse of the franc coins depicts King Zog. In 1935, bronze 1 and 2 gold cents were issued, equal in value to the 5 and 10 qintars respectively. This coin series depicted distinct neoclassical motifs, said to have been influenced by the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III who was known to have been a coin collector. These coins depict the mint marks "R", "V" or "L", indicating Rome, Vienna or London.

Under the direction of Benito Mussolini, Italy invaded and occupied Albania and issued a new series of coins in 1939 in denominations of Lek 0.20, Lek 0.50, 1 Lek and 2 Lek in stainless steel, and silver 5 Lek, and 10 Lek. Aluminium-bronze Lek 0.05 and Lek 0.10 were introduced in 1940. A fixed exchange with the Italian lira was established at 5:6.25 (1 Lek = Lit.1.25, or Fr.A.1 = Lit.6.25). These coins were issued until 1941 and bear the portrait of Italian King Victor Emmanuel III on the obverse and the Albanian eagle with fasces on the reverse.

In 1947, shortly after the Communist Party took power, older coins were withdrawn from circulation and a new coinage was introduced, consisting of zinc 1⁄2 Lek, 1 Lek, 2 Lek and 5 Lek. These all depicted the socialist national crest. This coinage was again minted in 1957 and used until the currency reform of 1965.


### Second lek

In 1965, a confiscatory monetary form was carried out at a rate of 10:1.

Aluminium coins (dated 1964) were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 qintars and 1 Lek. All coins show the socialist state emblem.

In 1969, a second series of aluminium 5, 10, 20, 50 qintars and 1 Lek coins was released commemorating the 1944 liberation from fascism. The three smallest denominations remained similar in design to the 1964 series but depicted "1944-1969" on the obverse. The 50 qintar and lek coins showed patriotic and military images.

In 1988, a third redesign of aluminium 5, 10, 20, 50 qintars and 1 Lek coins was released. The 50 qindarka and 1 Lek coins were problematically identical in size, weight, and appearance, so aluminium-bronze 1 Lek coins with the inscription "*Republika Popullore Socialiste e Shqipërisë*" were released later that year for better identification. In 1989, a cupro-nickel 2 Lek coin was introduced.

All three of these coin series remained in circulation during and shortly after the 1991 revolution. On 1 January 1992, those coins lost their legal tender status, effectively making qintars obsolete.


#### Foreign exchange certificates

Similar to many other socialist countries, Albania issued foreign exchange certificates, which only circulated in specially designated shops, and their exchange into regular lek banknotes was prohibited.


### Third lek

In 1995 and 1996, new coins were introduced in denominations of 1 Lek, 5 Lekë, 10 Lekë, 20 Lekë and 50 Lekë, with a bimetallic 100 Lekë added in 2000.These coins use the letter *e* instead of the correct *ë*, but banknotes are spelt correctly.
