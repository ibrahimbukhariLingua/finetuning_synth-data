## Company History

Source:

* In 1871, the "Christkatholischer Begräbniß-Verein" (Catholic Funeral Association) was founded by a group of Munich citizens, offering funeral insurance to its members.
* By 1927, the number of members had risen to 140,000. In that same year, the institution was converted into a mutual insurance association.
* In 1929, the association began offering life insurance.
* By 1933, the number of members had risen to 400,000. In 1938 the association was forced by the rulers of the Third Reich to rename itself as "*Münchener Begräbnisverein*" (Munich Funeral Association).
* In July 1945, two months after the end of World War II, the association resumed business operations at Sendlinger Strasse 55 in Munich.
* In 1954 the association had a portfolio of 1.1 million insurance contracts.
* In 1969, the company renamed itself to "Lebensversicherung von 1871 a.G. München" to reflect the growing share of life insurance policies in its portfolio.
* In 1977, the company moved its headquarters to Regina-Haus at Maximiliansplatz 5 (formerly the Regina Palace Hotel).
* In 1987, the company chose a new logo, a stylized version of the "Frauenkirche" (*Cathedral of Our Dear Lady*) representing its founding home, the city of Munich.
* In 1993, shortly before the completion of the European Single Market, LV 1871 launched new products such as supplementary long-term care insurance as part of an overall pension plan, disability insurance for the self-employed including a premium reimbursement guarantee, and critical illness insurance policies with capital advance in the case of serious illnesses.
* In 1999, LV 1871 launched "eXtra-Rente" pension insurance, which was awarded the *Capital Innovation Prize* for insurance.
* In January 2013, the trade journals *Euro* and *Euro am Sonntag* awarded the *Golden Bull* for the company's "4flex" product. Customers can choose between a classic retirement or a lump-sum payment, as well as between "eXtraRenten" (supplementary retirement income) or a long-term care insurance plan. In the event of a serious illness or the need for long-term care, the pension is flexibly adjusted.
