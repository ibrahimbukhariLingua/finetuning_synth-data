Sitecore Commerce Server


# Sitecore Commerce Server



**Commerce Server** was a software product for building multichannel e-commerce applications and systems using .NET Framework technology.
The product has changed ownership and names several times. Previously known as Microsoft Commerce Server, it was at the end of the product lifecycle developed, sold, and supported by Sitecore for building multichannel e-commerce applications. It was replaced in 2021 with Sitecore Commerce Cloud. The latest release of the product was Sitecore Commerce Server 11.1, released in October 2014.


## Ownership History

The core software that formed the basis for the Commerce Server product line was developed by eShop and purchased by Microsoft in 1996. eShopâ€™s technologies were integrated into Microsoft Merchant Server, which evolved into Microsoft Site Server in 1997,\* and eventually to Microsoft Commerce Server in 2000.

In 2007 Microsoft outsourced product development of Commerce Server to Cactus Commerce, which was acquired in 2011 by Ascentium. Ascentium then bought outright the Commerce Server business from Microsoft that same year. In 2012 Ascentium re-branded its company as SMITH and split off the Commerce Server product division into a wholly owned subsidiary known as commerceserver.net.

Sitecore acquired commerceserver.net in late 2013 and released the product as Sitecore Commerce Server in 2014.
