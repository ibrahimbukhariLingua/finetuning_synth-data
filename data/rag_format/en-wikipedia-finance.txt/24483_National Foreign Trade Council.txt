# National Foreign Trade Council



Founded in 1914, the **National Foreign Trade Council** (NFTC) is an American trade association that advocates for an open, rules-based international trade system. Its stated goal is to serve its hundreds of member companies by providing them with services and support related to international trade policy and international tax policy. The NFTC is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and its current president is Jake Colvin.


## History

The organization was founded in 1914 by James A. Farrell, the President of US Steel. As the leader of that company, he grew sales through international exports and became an early advocate for global trade.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
