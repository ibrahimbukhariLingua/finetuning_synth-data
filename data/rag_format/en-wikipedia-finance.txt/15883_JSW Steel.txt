## History

JSW Steel's history can be traced back to 1982, when the Jindal Group acquired Piramal Steel Limited, which operated a mini steel mill at Tarapur in Maharashtra and renamed it as Jindal Iron and Steel Company (JISCO). Soon after the acquisition the group set up its first steel plant in 1982 at Vasind, near Mumbai.

Later, in 1994, Jindal Vijayanagar Steel Limited (JVSL) was set up with its plant located at Toranagallu in the Bellary-Hospet area in the State of Karnataka, the heart of the iron ore belt and spread over 10,000 acres (40 km²) of land. It is well connected to both the Mormugao Port and Chennai Port and is 340 kilometres from Bangalore. It is said to be the sixth largest steel plant in the world.

In the year 2005, JISCO and JVSL merged to form JSW Steel Limited. It also set up a plant at Salem with an annual capacity of 1 million tonnes.


## Operations

As of July 2023, the installed with a production capacity of 29.7 MTPA in India and the United States. The company is aiming to boost the total steel production capacity to 38.5 MTPA by the financial year 2025.

As of April 2023, nearly 98% of JSW Steel's revenue comes from steel and related products — long rolled products (18%), galvanised coils/sheets (15%), CR coils/sheets (9%), plates/pipes (5%), other miscellaneous steel products (5%), and iron ore (2%), in that order. Overall, 70% of revenue is derived from India, and 30% is from overseas. The company historical emphasis has primarily been on flat products, stemming from its origins in a cold rolling mill. As part of its corporate strategy, the company typically directs half of its flat products to downstream facilities for additional value-enhancing processes like galvanizing, coating, or tinning.

JSW Steel plans to utilize energy from a forthcoming 3,800-tonne hydrogen plant at its Vijayanagar facility, aiming to provide green steel at a premium price. The company has established an agreement with its affiliate, JSW Energy, to procure green hydrogen and green oxygen for the production of sustainable steel. Additionally, the company will earn carbon credits based on the amount of conventional thermal power that is substituted with green energy. By 2030, the company plans to set up a green steel plant to comply with the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and gradually reduce it use of blast furnaces throughout its value chain.


### Plants

* **JSW Vijaynagar Works** (also known as Integrated Steel Plant, Vijaynagar): It is a flagship plant of the company, which also stands as the largest single-location steel manufacturing unit across India. At present, the plant is in the midst of a brownfield expansion aimed at increasing its current capacity from 13 MTPA to 18 MTPA by FY24. This expansion will cover 600 acres and involve the addition of a 4.5 MTPA blast furnace, two steel melt shops of 350 tonnes each, a 5 MTPA hot strip mill, alongside various other related facilities. In 2017-2018, a new ladle furnace slag recycling process was adopted at Vijayanagar Works as part of a new environmental and waste disposal strategy. The slag was stabilized using an alumina-based ladle-covering compound. The trials were conducted in two phases. Firstly, to prevent the dusting phenomenon in Al-killed steel ladle slag and generate lump slag, a suitable ladle covering compound was selected, and the slag was chemically modified. Secondly, the lump slag was utilized as a 100% replacement for synthetic slag in Si-killed steel ladles, reducing specific consumption from 1.2 kg per ton of liquid steel to zero. The report highlighted eliminating specific synthetic slag consumption at 1.2 kg per ton of liquid steel.
* **JSW Dolvi Works** (also known as Integrated Steel Plant, Dolvi): This plant was acquired by the company in 2010 from Ispat Steel for $3 billion. It was first Indian steel plant to adopt a combination of ConArc technology for both steel-making and compact strip production. Whereas a blast furnace transforms iron ore into steel, ConArc utilizes iron pellets, which are essentially one step processed iron ore. In 2022, Dolvi Works obtained security protection from the Central Industrial Security Force. At that time, it was the 13th industrial facility in the private sector in India to be placed under CISF security apparatus.
* **JSW Sambalpur Works** (also known as Integrated Steel Plant, Rengali): This plant was acquired by the company in 2019 after the liquidation of Bhushan Power & Steel by National Company Law Tribunal. It added 3.5 MTPA to overall steel production capacity of the company.
