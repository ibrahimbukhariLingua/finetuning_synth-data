## History

The company was established in October 2004 as Resmex plc. In March 2005, its shares were listed on London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market.

In August 2005, Resmex acquired Sermines de Mexico S.A. de C.V., which owned mineral exploration and development rights in three concessions in the California–Sonora Gold Belt in Mexico. In 2006, it acquired Xtract Oil Limited, an Australian oil shale company developing the Julia Creek oil shale deposit, from Intermin Resources Limited. To finance this deal, it issued new shares to Cambrian Mining, which became the major shareholder of Resmex. Correspondingly, the company changed its name to Xtract Energy, starting from 2 May 2006.

In October 2006, Xtract Energy purchased 19.5% of Wasabi Energy Ltd, 18.6% of Aviva Corporation (not affiliated with Aviva Energy Corp.) and 28.2% of Cambrian Oil & Gas from Cambrian Mining. Later, Cambrian Oil & Gas merged to Xtract through which Xtract got shareholdings in MEO Australia Ltd and Elko Energy, and ownership of Zhibek Resources, a company involved in oil and gas activities in Kyrgyzstan. In August 2007, Xtract sold its interests in Aviva Corporation to Wasabi Energy in exchange for new shares and warrants in Wasabi. The shareholding in Wasabi was sold in 2009. At the same year, the shareholding in MEO Australia was sold.

In 2008, Xtract together with Merty Energy, Petroleum Exploration, Education and Services Inc established a joint venture Extrem Energy A.S. for oil exploration and production activities in Turkey.

In May 2012, Xtract transferred its holdings in Zhibek Resources to Caspian Oil & Gas (now: Equus Mining Limited) in exchange of a minority shareholding in that company, and exit from Kyrgyzstan.

In December 2012, Xtract Energy disposed its oil shale interests by transferring 100% stake in Xtract Oil Limitedand 70% stake in Xtract Energy (Oil Shale) Morocco S.A. to Global Oil Shale Group Limited in exchange of the strategic stake in that company.

On 25 June 2013, the company changed its name to Xtract Resources. It was refocused into a mining industry.

In 2014, Xtract bought the Chepica gold and copper mine in Chile. The deal included also the acquisition of the Mejillones phosphate deposit; however, that deposit was resold to Mines Global later at the same year. In 2015, Xtract bought the Manica gold mining project in Mozambique.

The full ownership of the project would transferred to Xtract by December 2016.

In 2013, Xtract Oil was transferred to the Global Oil Shale Group. To extract oil from the Julia Creek oil shale resource, the Galoter process was proposed. At the same time, Xtract Technologies, a subsidiary of Xtract Oil, developed a supercritical solvent shale oil extraction technology which is a type of the donor solvent technology. In this process, oil shale would be processed in enclosed vessels in the presence of hydrogen solvents. The company claimed that the process would be carried out at moderate temperatures that do not liberate carbon dioxide. Through a 70% stake in Xtract Energy (Oil Shale) Morocco SA, a joint venture with Alraed of Saudi Arabia, Xtract Energy evaluated an oil shale deposit near Tarfaya, Morocco.
