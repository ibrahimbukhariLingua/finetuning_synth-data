### Compensation criticism

In January 2019, Williams resigned from PG&E as the company struggled to deal with legal and financial repercussions associated with a series of devastating California wildfires, which occurred in 2017 and 2018. The next day, PG&E announced its plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Michael Hiltzik, writing in a column for the *Los Angeles Times*, criticized Williams' performance as well as PG&E for providing a $10mm+ pay package, which included $2.6mm in severance pay, when Williams left as the company prepared to enter bankruptcy. In 2018, despite the company losing more than $6 billion, Williams had received a pay raise of 8.1%. Hiltzik also reported that "Williams’ compensation encompassed numerous perks, including a car and driver, a $51,000 security system for her home, health club and “executive health” services worth $5,453 and financial services subsidized to the tune of $7,980."

In April 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed concern that new PG&E board members would have little knowledge of California, and may lack the expertise to safely run a utility.

Williams was succeeded by John Simon as interim CEO, then, in May 2019, Bill Johnson became CEO, garnering "more than twice the base salary" of Williams.

Williams is married to Jay Williams, and they have two daughters.
