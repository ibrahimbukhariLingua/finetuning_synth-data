### Controversies

A national audit has revealed irregular dealings at the Hingurana sugar factory which is run as a public-private partnership between the government of Sri Lanka, Brown and Company, and LOLC Holdings. It has revealed that billions worth of loans were taken from LOLC-associated companies at higher interest rates. A forensic audit carried out by KPMG revealed that the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) had bought stocks in Brown and Company worth LKR737 million without approval from its investment committee. In some cases, the deal ticket of the transaction was unsigned, therefore the dealer could not be identified. As a result, EPF has made a loss of LKR1.1 billion.
