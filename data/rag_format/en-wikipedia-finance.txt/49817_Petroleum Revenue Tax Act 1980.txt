Petroleum Revenue Tax Act 1980


# Petroleum Revenue Tax Act 1980



The **Petroleum Revenue Tax Act 1980** (c. 1) is a UK act of Parliament associated with UK enterprise law that made new provisions for petroleum revenue tax (introduced by the Oil Taxation Act 1975). The act required that payments on account of tax should be made in advance of an assessment, and that interest payable on tax was brought forward.


## Background

In introducing the Petroleum Revenue Tax Bill to Parliament in December 1979, the Treasury Minister of State, Peter Rees, admitted that the Bill was partly a response to the Government’s critical cash flow problem, caused by industrial action. The Bill was designed to advance the payments of petroleum revenue tax (PRT). It was estimated that the provisions would bring £700 million forward from 1980–81 into the financial year 1979–80. In addition, £300 million would be brought forward into 1980–81. It would also bring the regime for payment of PRT into line with that for the payment of royalties on North Sea oil revenues.
