## History


### Kingston Civic Employees Credit Union

The *Kingston Civic Employees Credit Union* was founded by members of the City of Kingston police, fire and municipal services departments and launched October 28, 1957. Alphonse Desjardins assisted CS Coop, the first credit union in Canada outside Quebec. Federal civil servants were prompted by an article in their magazine The Civilian, when it reported on loan sharks charging civil servants up to 200% for payday loans. After the Government of Ontario passed a credit union law in 1928, many credit unions like the Kingston-based institution were formed to ensure access to fair and equitable financial treatment for their members.


### Kingston Community Credit Union

In 1974, Kingston Community Credit Union Limited applied to become an open-bond community Credit Union having merged with Northern Electric employees Credit Union and having amalgamated with the Teamsters Credit Union and Kingston General Hospital Employees Credit Union (by 1978). Starting from the basement of City Hall with 30 members each putting in 50 cents each, KCCU eventually moved to a location in downtown Kingston on Queen Street and eventually bought the 18 Market Street location across from City Hall. Since that time, KCCU has been a community bond credit union, open to all residents of Kingston and the greater area. KCCU was a member of Credit Union Central of Ontario which has subsequently merged with Credit Union Central of British Columbia to become Central 1.
