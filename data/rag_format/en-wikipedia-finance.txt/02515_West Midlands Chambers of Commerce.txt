### Emphasis on exports

The WMCC is working with businesses, and lobbying the government and local authorities, to increase the emphasis on exports for manufacturers based in the West Midlands.

In May 2013 WMCC introduced a new service aimed at making it easier for businesses to export. This involves providing a simple way to generate all the documentation required to ship goods overseas, including letters of credit, by using a centralised management system. This allows a business to enter the information once rather than having to do it repeatedly for each individual document. Online training courses are also being developed to teach business owners the special requirements of international trade.
