The **Sirivadhanabhakdi family** (Thai: สิริวัฒนภักดี) is a Sino-Thai business family and one of the wealthiest in Thailand. The family is headed by Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, who made his fortune in the alcoholic beverages business and has since, through many major acquisitions, expanded the family's holdings into other food and drink properties, real estate, retail, and other industries. The family has controlling stakes in the listed companies ThaiBev, Oishi Group, Berli Jucker, Big C Supercenter, Fraser and Neave, Frasers Property, Asset World Corporation, among others, held both directly and under their holdings banner **TCC Group**. It is regarded as one of the big five business families that dominate business in Thailand.


## History

Charoen was born in Bangkok in 1944, the second of eleven children. His father, a street vendor, was a Teochew immigrant from Shantou, among the last generation of immigrants to arrive before the Chinese Communist Revolution ended migration in 1949. The family, of the Soh/Su (蘇) clan, first took the Thai surname Srisomburananont (ศรีสมบูรณานนท์). The name Sirivadhanabhakdi—from Pali *siri* 'prosperity' + *vaḍḍhana* 'increasing' + Sanskrit *bhakti* 'devotion'—was granted to Charoen and his descendants by King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 1988.

Charoen has five children with his wife **Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi** (1943–2023): Atinant Bijananda, Wallapa Traisorat, Thapana Sirivadhanabhakdi, Thapanee Techajareonvikul, and Panote Sirivadhanabhakdi. They have since taken up executive positions in various branches of the family's business empire.
