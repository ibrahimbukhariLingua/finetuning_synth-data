## Work

Strebulaev developed a framework with Will Gornall that asseses the value of private venture capital (VC) backed companies. Their valuation model is built on the option pricing methodology and takes into account complicated shareholder structures of VC-backed companies. They found that most unicorns (highly valued VC-backed companies) are overvalued, with a median overvaluation of 50%. Strebulaev's research also includes studies on the decision-making of startup investors, the organization and design of VC and corporate VC units, and the importance of venture capital in innovation and the economy. He has shown that the VC industry led to the creation of most large public US companies in the last 50 years and is an important growth engine behind the US innovation economy.
His work has been widely published in leading academic journals including *The Journal of Finance*, *The Review of Financial Studies*, and *The Journal of Financial Economics*. Strebulaev has received many awards for his work, including the First Paper Prize of the Brattle Award in *the Journal of Finance* and The First Place of the Fama-DFA Prize at *the Journal of Financial Economics*.
