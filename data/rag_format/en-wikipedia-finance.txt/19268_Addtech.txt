## History

Addtech originates from the company **Bergman & Beving,** which was founded in 1906 and went public in 1976. The division of operations into business areas, and the combination of decentralization and own responsibility, were already catchwords at the time of Bergman & Beving, and has laid the foundation for the business philosophy of today's Addtech. In 2001, Bergman & Beving divided operations into three independent subsidiaries, each of which is listed on the Nasdaq OMX Stockholm, also called Stockholm Stock Exchange. Three new companies were born; Bergman & Beving, Lagercrantz Group, and Addtech. Since Addtech's listing in 2001, more than 100 corporate acquisitions have been made.
