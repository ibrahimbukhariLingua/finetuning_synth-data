List of Russian nationals named in the CAATSA unclassified report


# List of Russian nationals named in the CAATSA unclassified report



The **list of Russian nationals named in the CAATSA unclassified report**, also known as the **CAATSA Report** or "**Putin list**", was a list published by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2018. It contained the names of 210 prominent Russians, including members of the government of Russian president Vladimir Putin and alleged Russian oligarchs.


## Background

Section 241 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017 (СААTSA) required the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, to submit to the appropriate congressional committees a detailed report оп senior political figures and oligarchs in the Russian Federation (Section 241 (a)(1)) and on Russian parastatal entities (Section 241 (а)(2)).

Although it was widely, and incorrectly, reported in the media that those on the list "may be subject to sanctions", the CAATSA Report itself made clear that it "in no way should be interpreted to impose sanctions on those individuals or entities". It also specified that inclusion in the report "does not constitute the determination by any agency that any of those individuals or entities meet the criteria for designation under any sanctions program", and in no way indicates that "the U.S. Government has information about the individual's involvement in malign activities".

The list below is from the unclassified section of the Section 241 (a)(1) section of the report.


## Controversy regarding the "oligarchs" section

The list of "oligarchs" submitted as part of one of the five reports delivered to Congress on 29 January 2018 included 96 names.

According to the document itself, its criterion for inclusion as an "oligarch" was simply being a Russian with a net worth of over $1 billion. The list was criticised for being indiscriminate, and including critics of Putin.

Shortly after the list was released, it was reported that the Treasury Department had simply copied it from the Forbes' 2017 "World Billionaires" list: people, including those with non-Russian citizenship on the *Forbes* list who had Russian heritage and a net worth of $1 billion or more, had been indiscriminately included in the CAATSA Report. In its response to a lawsuit asserting that the compilation of the list was "arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law", the Treasury Department has confirmed that it is "not challenging" the allegation that it had "simply republished" the *Forbes* billionaires list.
