## Plot


### Osaka arc

Naoki Hanzawa (Masato Sakai) joins the Sangyo Chuo Bank (one of the predecessors of Tokyo Chuo Bank before its merger with Tokyo Daiichi Bank) and becomes Chief of the Loans Division at the Osaka Nishi branch. In a flashback, it is revealed that his father, a factory owner, committed suicide after the bank refused to extend the loan. Hanzawa swears revenge against the Sangyo Chuo Bank bank by climbing through ranks and controls it.

When he proposes a loan for a struggling but promising screw manufacturer, he is forced by branch manager Asano (Kanji Ishimaru) to grant an unsecured loan of 500 million yen to Nishi Osaka Steel, despite the lack of proper financial investigation, to meet the target loan set by the head office. However, Nishi Osaka Steel goes bankrupt, and both president Mitsuru Higashida (Takashi Ukaji) and the 500 million yen loan disappear. Asano shifts the blame to Hanzawa and orders him to recover the amount or face termination. Hanzawa promises that if he manages to recover the money, Asano must kneel and apologize to him.

Hanzawa joins forces with Kiyohiko Takeshita (Hidekazu Akai), whose business was lost as collateral damage from Nishi Osaka Steel's bankruptcy. The two discover that the entire event was a scheme set up by Asano and Higashida who turned out to be childhood friends. It is revealed that Osaka Steel is purposely bankrupted by Higashida to defraud 500 millions yen from the bank and Asano helped Higashida after being bribed 50 millions yen to pay back his loss in a stock scheme went wrong. Racing against time and the Taxation Office investigation, Naoki is able to recover the entire 500 million yen for the bank from Higashida's bank account from the New York Trust Bank, leaving Higashida's empty-handed and he is arrested later on. Hanzawa wishes to expose Asano to the media, but out of sympathy for his wife and family he instead leverages his evidence against Asano, ensuring that his subordinates can be promoted to positions of their choice. Asano formally apologizes to Hanzawa and states that he did all of this because he lost too much from his failed stock investment. Asano then kneels before Hanzawa to apologize to him as promise. Subsequently, Hanzawa is promoted to deputy Manager of the 2nd Operations Department at banks' Tokyo Headquarters while Asano is transferred to be the manager of the bank branch in the Philippine, much to his dismay as he will be forced to be away from his family.


### Tokyo arc

One year later, Hanzawa is placed in charge of investigating Iseshima Hotel, which borrowed 20 billion yen from Tokyo Chuo Bank. The hotel suffered a loss of 12 billion yen, and with an FSA (Financial Services Agency) inspection coming up, the bank may potentially have to provide a loan loss provision of 150 billion yen should Iseshima Hotel be labelled bankrupt. Hanzawa discovers that Director Owada (Teruyuki Kagawa) was at the forefront of providing the loan to Iseshima Hotel, even though there was substantial evidence showing that the hotel was not in a good financial position. Kondo (Kenichi Takito), a friend of Hanzawa who works at Tamiya Electric, discovers that Owada was also behind an indirect loan to Laffite, a fashion company owned by Owada's wife. Hanzawa puts this evidence against Owada in front of a board of directors meeting and further exposes that Owada did this to oust the Chairman so he can take his position. Seeking personal revenge for his father's death, Hanzawa forces Owada to kneel down before him and apologize for his actions in front of all the board members, despite his supervisor and the Chairman's disapproval. During the final scene, Chairman Nakanowatari formally terminates Owada's employment while Hanzawa is "exiled" from the bank to Tokyo Central Securities.
