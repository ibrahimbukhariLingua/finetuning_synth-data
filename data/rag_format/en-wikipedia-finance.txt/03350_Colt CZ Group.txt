## History

In June 2020, the holding company listed its shares on the Prague Stock Exchange with a view of funding an expansion in the United States. The first trading took place in September of the same year.

On 11 February 2021 the European company announced the acquisition of the Colt Holding Company (the parent company to the Colt's Manufacturing Company from the US) for $220 million, enabling further expansion into the U.S. market. Česká zbrojovka Group completed the purchase on 24 May 2021 and renamed itself Colt CZ Group SE on 12 April 2022.

The company's dividend policy estimates the level of shareholder payout as a third of the company's net profit. In 2020 this constituted a payment of CZK 7.50 per single share, increasing to CZK 25 per s/s in 2021.

On December 18, 2023 CZ Group SE announced it executed an agreement with CBC Europe S.à r.l. to purchase 100% interest in Sellier & Bellot a.s.

January 3, 2024 Colt CZ Group acquired ownership of the Mk 47 Striker 40mm Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher system from General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS).

On July 16, 2024, the Governments of Ukraine and the Czech Republic signed two agreements on the joint production of weapons. Česká zbrojovka will supply Ukraine with all the parts from which the CZ BREN 2 rifles are assembled.
