## Career


### McDonald's

Skinner began his career with McDonald's in 1971 as a restaurant manager trainee in Carpentersville, Illinois. He never graduated from college, attending Roosevelt University in Chicago, before dropping out after his sophomore year.

Prior to becoming CEO, Skinner was President and Chief Operating Officer of the McDonald's Restaurant Group with corporate management responsibility for Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA), and Latin America. Prior to that, he was responsible for McDonald's Japan Limited, their second-largest market. Skinner held numerous positions in the U.S. Corporation, including Director of Field Operations, Market Manager, Regional Vice President and U.S. Senior Vice President and Zone Manager.

Skinner was named CEO of McDonald's Corp in 2004 and refocused the company on customer strategies, business disciplines and close global alignment. Jim Skinner was succeeded as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for McDonald's Corporation by Don Thompson on June 30, 2012. Vice Chairman was a position that he held before becoming CEO in November 2004.

His greatest accomplishment, the "Plan to Win" strategy, managed to flip the company by reversing its falling profits. This strategy focused on improving on locations that already existed instead of expanding and building more. They hoped to achieve “faster, friendlier service; tastier food; a more appealing ambiance; better value; and sharper marketing.” By shifting strategies, Skinner and his team were able to increase McDonald's total sales, increasing from $50.1 billion in 2004 to $70.1 billion in 2008.
