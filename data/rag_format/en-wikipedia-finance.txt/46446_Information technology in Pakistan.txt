Information technology in Pakistan


# Information technology in Pakistan



**Information technology (IT) in Pakistan** is a thriving industry with significant potential for growth. The Ministry of Information Technology oversees its development. Despite financial crises, the IT sector has consistently demonstrated economic success.


## Overview

The first IT policy and implementation strategy was approved under the leadership of Atta-ur-Rahman, the Federal Minister of Science and Technology, in August 2000. This laid the groundwork for the development of the sector. During this period, the emphasis was placed on quality IT education in universities rather than numbers.

The Telecom Policy was announced in December 2015, and later the National Digital Pakistan Policy was approved by the cabinet in May 2018.

The period from 2013 to 2018 witnessed a landmark revolution in the sector following the launch of 3G/4G technologies.

According to Bloomberg, 2021 was a record year for Pakistan's technology sector, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 China tech crackdown.


## E-government

The Government of Pakistan has prioritized Information technology as a key component of its efforts to establish an "Information age" within the country. Significant progress has been made in developing efficient computerized e-government systems for major departments, including the police, law enforcement agencies, and district administration. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has also implemented computerized registration systems for issuing essential documents such as national identity cards, passports, and permanent residency cards. IT has played a crucial role in streamlining work procedures for the civil service and other government-related sectors.

According to a study published by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Pakistan has been highly exposed to Information Technology while pursuing the concepts of e-governance and e-commerce:

> Pakistan's communication system is also reliable. This has now fully graduated into the email, Internet and IT culture perse. The country is fast exploring the brave new world of information technology and keenly assimilating the requirements of e-government and e-commerce. Information technology has opened a new business frontier for Pakistan. The government is assigning high priority to information technology both in terms of policy limelight and resource allocation.

## Local-language computing

In 1994, Concept Software Pvt Ltd, an Indian software company, collaborated with Multilingual Solutions, a UK based company, to develop InPage Urdu for Pakistan's newspaper industry.


### Urdu

The Center for Research in Urdu Language Processing (CRULP) conducts research and development in linguistic and computational aspects of Urdu, as well as other languages of Pakistan, in areas such as speech processing, computational linguistics and script processing.


### Sindhi

Sindhi has also been digitised to make it easier to publish Sindhi newspapers, magazines and books. InPage also offers support for Sindhi with the proper fonts and ligatures which makes it easier for people to type in the Sindhi language without any difficulty.


## Software development in Pakistan

Software development is a rapidly growing field in Pakistan. The government has actively supported this growth through various programs that encourage software development and exports. Pakistani IT companies have successfully developed software for a wide range of businesses and services.

Locally developed software packages are available at affordable prices for schools, hospitals, supermarkets, and other organizations. Large-scale control systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, have also been developed for use in textile, pharmaceutical, food, beverage, and other industries.

The increasing popularity of Android smartphones, tablets, and Apple iPads has significantly boosted the mobile applications development industry. With minimal capital investment, individuals can easily develop these applications from home using a personal computer and an internet connection. Educational institutions have also responded to the growing demand by offering diplomas and short courses in software and application development for young people.
