Collegium of State Income


# Collegium of State Income



The **Collegium of State Income** (Russian: Камер-коллегия, *Kamer-kollegiya*; or **Revenue**) was a Russian executive body (collegium), created in the government reform of 1717. It was de-established during the decentralising reforms of Catherine II of Russia in 1785, restored 12 years later by her successor Paul I to be finally liquidated in 1801. It was responsible for the management of state fees and some branches of the economy (agriculture, etc.); later, some of its affairs were transferred to other collegia.
