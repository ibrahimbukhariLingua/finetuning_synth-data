# East of England Co-operative Society



The **East of England Co-operative Society** is the fourth largest consumer co-operative in the United Kingdom after The Co-operative Group, The Midcounties Co-operative and Central England Co-operative. It is a registered society with its headquarters in Wherstead, near Ipswich and trading in the eastern counties of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. The Society is the area's largest independent retailer.


## History

The East of England Co-operative Society is an amalgamation of smaller societies from across East Anglia which have joined together over the years. Most recently, the **Colchester and East Essex Co-operative Society** merged with the **Ipswich and Norwich Co-operative Society** in 2005.

The consumer co-operative movement has its roots in the early part of the nineteenth century and the principles of self-help and social equity that developed during the Victorian era. The first successful retail co-operative was established in 1844 by the Rochdale Pioneers. The Ipswich and Norwich Society was the product of an amalgamation, in 1993, of the Ipswich Co-operative Society (known as the Ipswich Industrial Co-operative Society from 1868 to 1968 and incorporating, since 1991, the engagements of the former Stowmarket Society, established 1889) and the Norwich Co-operative Society (formed in 1858). The Colchester and East Essex Society was founded as Colchester Co-operative Society in 1861, expanding through merger with the following co-operative societies:

| Society | Established | Transferred |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tiptree Self Help | 1895 | 1921 |
| Clacton | 1931 |
| Coggeshall Heart-in-Hand | 1945 |
| Harwich, Dovercourt and Parkeston | March 1967 |
| Maldon | Nov. 1967 |
| Witham | June 1970 |
| Earls Colne | Aug. 1970 |
