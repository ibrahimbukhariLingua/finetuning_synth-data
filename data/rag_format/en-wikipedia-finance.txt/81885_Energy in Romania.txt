Energy in Romania


# Energy in Romania

 

**Energy in Romania** describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in Romania.

Romania has significant oil and gas reserves, substantial coal deposits and it has considerable installed hydroelectric power. However, Romania imports oil and gas from Russia and other countries. To ease this dependency Romania seeks to use nuclear power as an alternative for electricity generation.


## Overview

Electric power in Romania is dominated by government enterprises, although privately operated coal mines and oil refineries also existed. Accordingly, Romania placed an increasingly heavy emphasis on developing nuclear power generation. Electric power was provided by the *Romanian Electric Power Corporation* (CONEL). Energy sources used in electric power generation consisted primarily of nuclear, coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The country has two nuclear reactors, located at Cernavodă, generating about 18–20% of the country's electricity production.
