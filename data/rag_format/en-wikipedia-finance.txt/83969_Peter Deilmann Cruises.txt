Peter Deilmann Cruises


# Peter Deilmann Cruises



**Peter Deilmann Cruises** (German: **Peter Deilmann Reederei GmbH & Co. KG**) was a German cruise company which offered river cruises throughout Europe and several ocean cruises. It was headquartered in Neustadt in Holstein, Germany.


## History

The founder Peter Deilmann began by chartering coasters in 1968. In 1973 he started his first passenger service between Neustadt (West Germany) and Ronne (Bornholm) using the small ferry *Nordlicht*. In 1976 and 1978 he acquired the elderly passenger ships Gripen and Frisia II (renamed *Nordshau* and *Nordpaloma*) to start a ferry service between Neustadt and Rodby. Also in 1976, Deilmann acquired the Norwegian Rost (renamed *Nordbrise*) and started a pioneer service between West and East Germany. *Nordbrise* was later used for his first cruise venture in Greenland.

In 1979, Deilmann ordered his first new cruise ship, the *Berlin*. She was owned by a consortium of German investors, and Deilmann only had a minority share. Whilst awaiting delivery, he also bought the *Regina Maris*, which was sold to Kuwait in 1982 for conversion into a large private yacht. *Berlin* was chartered for far-eastern service as the *Princess Mahsuri* between 1982 and 1985. The Deilmann charter of Berlin ended in 2004.

In 1983, Deilmann acquired their first river cruise vessel, the *Donauprinzessin*. In 1994 the first sailing cruise ship, the *Lili Marleen* was acquired. The impressive *Deutschland* was delivered in 1998.


## Insolvency

Following the insolvency of Peter Deilmann Reederei GmbH & Co. KG in 2009, with up to ten ocean and river cruise ships last, which had a turnover of around 50 million euros and around 50,000 passengers transported, was after the reestablishment of Reederei Peter Deilmann GmbH from 1 January 2010, the shipping company activity resumed. In October 2010, the new shipping company acquired a majority stake of the German industrial holding AURELIUS AG, which sold its stake to a minority share in early 2013 to the Callista Private Equity.

On January 20, 2015, the insolvency administrator had canceled all scheduled tours of Germany. The last and unique ship MS Deutschland was sold in May 2015 to the Las Vegas United States Investor Donald Hoffman of Absolute Nevada LLC, who chartered the ship previously to Plantours for 4 cruises and since September 2015 to Semester at Sea. It followed a non more existent Administrative domain in *Internet*.

The company has been closed by the courts, a court appointed a lawyer, who had been settling the outstanding accounts with the money received from the sale of the last ship, about one third (US$21 million) of about 60 million loan, the holders lost, once all matters have been settled and approved by the court – which can take many months – all activities were to close down, due bankruptcy and all remained costs to be paid.
