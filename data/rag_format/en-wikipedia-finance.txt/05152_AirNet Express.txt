AirNet Express


# AirNet Express



**AirNet** is an American Part 135 cargo airline based in Franklin County, Ohio, United States, near Columbus. It specializes in delivery of documents and small packages. Banks were once their main client, transporting checks for over 300 of the country's largest banks. With the passing of the Check 21 Act, and the increase in the usage of electronic banking, this has been greatly reduced. AirNet is now focusing on time critical documents and packages, such as those required in the scientific and medical field. The main sort facility is located at Rickenbacker International Airport in Columbus. In September 2008, AirNet announced that they were moving their sort facility to Chicago, reducing the number of aircraft, and redesigning their route network. Their corporate headquarters remains in Columbus.


## History

**Financial Air Express** / PDQ was founded in 1974 by Gerald Mercer in Pontiac, MI. **Jet Courier** was founded at about the same time by Donald Wright in Cincinnati, OH. Jet Courier changed its name to **Wright International Express** in January 1985. In July 1988, these two companies merged to become **US Check Airlines**, headed by Gerald Mercer. US Check acquired **Air Continental** of Norwalk, OH a year later to become a dominant player in the cancelled check transportation industry. US Check later acquired **Midway Aviation** of Dallas, TX, **Pacific Air Charter** of San Diego, CA, **Express Convenience Center** of Southfield, Massachusetts and **Data Air Courier** of Chicago, Illinois.

In order to raise additional capital and further grow the company, US Check went public in 1998 to become AirNet Systems. In 2008, AirNet Systems was purchased by Bayside Capital, which had once owned the now defunct Flight Express of Orlando, FL.
In August 2015 Kalitta Charters acquired AirNet.
