## History

The Redevelopment Commission, the prior owner of the 3-acre building site, in March 1971 agreed to sell it to Independence Square Associates in three transactions for a total of $1 million. Independence Square Associates was a joint venture between North Carolina National Bank and Crow, Carter, and Associates. The first parcel was 1-acre, and it was sold to ISA in August 1972. The second parcel was sold to ISA in late 1972. The final parcels were sold in May 1973. The three parcels were originally between the business of the S.H. Kress & CO building, Simpson Photo Service, and a Belk department store occupied a portion of the block the building was being built on. The original construction cost was $40 million. The client of the building, North Carolina National Bank, took out a $28 million loan from Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to cover construction costs for the tower and a 6-story 650 space parking structure.

The tower was 1 of 3 buildings under construction or newly finished in Uptown at that time. These 3 also included the new Wachovia building and Southern National Center, the 3 added totaled 1,400,000 square feet (130,000 m²) of office space. At this point in Charlotte history, it was the biggest office building boom. However, developers were optimist that the new supply would be quickly occupied. Don Browning, general manager of Independence Square Associates, stated this about his optimism about the market's ability to fill the office space in the building prior to its opening "If it continues the way it's been going, it will be more than 100 percent leased". This construction boom increased office space in Uptown from 2,300,000 square feet (210,000 m²) in 1969 to 7,000,000 square feet (650,000 m²) in 1974 at a development cost of $164.4 million.

As predicted the building saw a lot of leases signed prior to opening. The first of many pre-leases came in February 1973 Aetna Life announced they had signed a lease for 40,000 square feet (3,700 m²) in the building to house 300 employees. Then the next month in March 1973 Bache & Co. signed a lease for 30,000 square feet (2,800 m²) which included the 40th floor of the building. Later in the year in June 1973 The Charlotte Athletic Club announced they had signed a lease for 25,000 square feet (2,300 m²) and planned to occupy the space in the fall of 1975. In January 1974 another tenant announced they were leasing space ahead of the March 1974 building open. Korf Industries had signed a lease for 60,000 square feet (5,600 m²). The company relocated their corporate headquarters from Georgetown, South Carolina to occupy space on the 37th, 38th, and 39th floors.

In addition to new tenants in December 1973 it was announced that the plaza of the building would have a 5-ton sculpture from Italy that was a rotating cast bronze disc 15 feet in diameter called "Il Grande Disco" is located in the plaza adjacent to the building. The sculpture was in the part of the plaza between the hotel and tower which included granite pavers, with trees and shrubbery throughout the plaza. The sculpture was created by Italian sculpture Arnaldo Pomodoro. In 1973 it was worth $400,000.

The building opened in March 1974 as NCNB Plaza, it served as the world headquarters for NCNB and its successor, NationsBank, until the opening of NationsBank Corporate Center in 1992. NCNB moved in over a 3-month period. At time of completion it was the tallest building in North Carolina until it was surpassed by One First Union Center in 1987. The tower is located at the intersection of East Trade Street and South Tryon Street.

After the building opened in May 1974 Midrex, a steel maker based out of Toledo, Ohio, announced it was leasing the 40th floor in the building. Midrex was a subsidiary of Korf Industries formed in 1974 Also, in May 1974 Midrex posted an ad in the Charlotte Observer to recruit 225 people for engineering, design, and accounting jobs in Charlotte to expand its headcount in the building.
