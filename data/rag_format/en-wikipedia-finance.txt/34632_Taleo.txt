Taleo


# Taleo



**Taleo Corporation** was a publicly traded database vendor based in Dublin, California, which was acquired by Oracle in 2012. Taleo's product offerings primarily focus on talent acquisition (recruitment), performance management, learning and development, and compensation management. These capabilities combine to provide what Taleo calls "Talent Intelligence" — an enhanced level of insight into candidates and employees. Taleo sells its Human resource management system (HRMS / HRIS) products entirely via a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, in which all software and information resides in data centers operated and secured by Taleo.

On February 9, 2012, Oracle Corporation acquired Taleo Corporation for $1.9 billion.

Oracle Corporation continues to use the Taleo software name for its talent-management software suite. As of December 2013, Taleo software had over 20 million users.


## History

Taleo has its roots in Canada, where in 1996 Martin Ouellet established Viasite, a French-language job-board for candidates and employers. Ouellet and Louis Têtu soon began working with Fortune 500 companies interested in developing online approaches to recruiting that incorporated the efficiencies of supply-chain management processes.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Viasite was later renamed Recruitsoft, Inc. In 1999, Recruitsoft registered as a Delaware corporation with headquarters in San Francisco, California, and launched Recruiter WebTop, an online hiring management system. Global expansion followed, and by 2001 the company had secured customer relationships with large enterprises including Hewlett Packard, Dow Chemical, Agilent, Hasbro, American Airlines, United Airlines, Deloitte&Touche, Bombardier Aerospace and Transportation, MetLife, Cabletron Systems, and Sutter Health.

Recruitsoft, Inc. changed its name to Taleo Corporation in March 2004. As the talent-management market matured, Taleo added products and capabilities, integrating recruiting with performance management in 2008, adding compensation management in 2009, and including learning and talent development in 2010. As of 2010ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Taleo made solutions available in 187 countries and in 31 languages.

In August 2011, Taleo reported it had more than 5,000 customers ranging from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to large global enterprises, including nearly half of the Fortune 100.
