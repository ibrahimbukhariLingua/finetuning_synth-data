## State-owned enterprises turn into "greenhouses" for dignitaries

In 2014, Transparency International Moldova published a report on the transparency monitoring of state-owned companies and joint stock companies with state-owned capital:

"Transparency International Moldova considers that the legislation regulating the activity of state-owned enterprises needs to be substantially revised, especially in the context of improving the quality and efficiency of business management. In particular, in opinion of experts, more rigorous requirements are needed for the qualification and work experience of the candidates for the position of manager of the enterprise, the remuneration of the administrator with the economic and financial performances of the company, the transparency in the selection process or the appointment of the managers of the enterprises state", says Lilia Carasciuc, executive director of Transparency International Moldova.


## Law on state and municipal enterprise with regard to organization and operation of the Public Property Agency

This law was drafted for the purpose of updating the provisions Law no.146 of 16 June 1994 on the state enterprise. Through this project, the public policies for the management of state enterprises and municipal enterprises will be updated and made uniform to the general norms of corporate governance, the attributions of the founder, the board of directors and the administrator will be clearly defined and delimited. The project regulates the particularities of establishment, operation and closure of the activity of state enterprises and municipal enterprises, the way of setting up, registering, using the assets handed in administration, the component, the attributions and the responsibility of the governing bodies.

In order not to allow the alienation of the assets assigned to the public domain and the goods with a social destination, the payment of the obligations to the state and other creditors with the mentioned goods, it is proposed to establish a special legal regime for them with the separate registration in the accounting records. It is proposed to extend the attributions of the board of directors of state and municipal enterprises.

Several industry experts' remarks show that some Moldovan state and municipal enterprises use the single-source procurement procedure to purchase goods and services: this generates significant risks, including potentially higher payments than market prices and a favorable environment for corruption. In order to diminish this phenomenon in the project, it is foreseen that the government will be responsible for the elaboration of the Model Regulation on the purchase of goods, things and services at the state and municipal enterprise.

This project proposes the setting up of the censor commission within the state / municipal enterprises, which will exercise the control over the economic and financial activity of the enterprise on a semi-annual basis. At the same time, for the purpose of excluding agreements between two or more parties, through which certain rights, goods are transferred or a commercial exchange is made within the enterprise, the project includes provisions for governing the settlement of conflicts of interest transactions.

The necessity to include provisions on the voluntary dissolution of the state enterprise and the municipal enterprise results from the fact that currently, in the State Register of Legal Entities, there are about 320 state-owned enterprises uncontrolled by the founders, which do not work for many years, and usually, do not have any material goods.

There is the risk of state liability towards the obligations of the state-owned enterprise, arising from the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the state is responsible for any debt of the enterprise. In order to observe the principle of maximum transparency in the activity of the state enterprise, the draft stipulates that the documents and the information are to be placed on the website of the enterprise, the founder and the Public Property Agency.
