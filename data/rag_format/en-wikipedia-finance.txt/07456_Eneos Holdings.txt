# Eneos Holdings



**ENEOS Holdings, Inc.** (ENEOSホールディングス株式会社) is a Japanese global petroleum and metals conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. In 2012 the multinational corporation consisted of 24,691 employees worldwide and, as of March 2013, JX Holdings was the forty-third largest company in the world by revenue. It is one of the core companies of the Mitsubishi Group through its predecessor (the original Nippon Oil Company)'s merger with Mitsubishi Oil.


## Establishment

ENEOS Holdings was established on April 1, 2010 as JXTG Holdings through the joint share transfer by Nippon Oil Corporation and Nippon Mining Holdings, Inc. On July 1, 2010, all the businesses of both Group Companies were integrated and reorganized under JX Holdings, resulting in the incorporation of three core business companies:

* ENEOS Corporation – petroleum refining and marketing
* JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration – oil and natural gas exploration and production
* JX Nippon Mining & Metals – mining and metal

In April 2017, JX Holdings and TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. merged to form JXTG Holdings. JXTG Holdings was renamed in June 2020 to ENEOS Holdings.


## Controversy

In August 2022, ENEOS CEO Tsutomu Sugimori resigned for what was described at the time as personal reasons. The following month, however, the company confirmed that the reason for Sugimori's departure was due to allegations that he sexually harassed and injured a woman working at a hostess bar in Okinawa, which were later substantiated. The company's statement followed a report about the incident in a weekly magazine.

In December 2023, Takeshi Saito was dismissed as the president of ENEOS after an independent investigation validated claims that he inappropriately hugged a woman at a social gathering while intoxicated.
