## History

Gelesis was founded by PureTech Ventures, a life sciences venture firm based in Boston, and ExoTech Bio, an Israel-based research and development company. The company operates as an affiliate of PureTech Health. Former PureTech Ventures partner Yishai Zohar co-founded the company and served as CEO.

The company's technology was co-invented by Alessandro Sannino, a professor of engineering at the University of Salento, who had been researching the idea prior to the launch of Gelesis.

In January 2008, the company raised $16 million in its first financing round, led by OrbiMed Advisors and Queensland BioCapital Funds.

In 2010, the company passed the first human trials of its treatment. The company’s product was originally called Attiva, but was later renamed Gelesis100.

In 2014, Gelesis raised $12 million in its fifth funding round, bringing its total funding to $42 million.

In March 2015, the company closed a $22 million funding round. In April 2015, the company announced an initial public offering (IPO) for $60 million, but pulled out later that year. In December 2015, Gelesis raised $31.5 million shortly after cancelling its IPO.

In 2018, Gelesis raised $30 million in preparation for regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe and initial marketing of Gelesis100.

In January 2022, the company completed a business combination with Capstar Special Purpose Acquisition Corp. and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GLS."
