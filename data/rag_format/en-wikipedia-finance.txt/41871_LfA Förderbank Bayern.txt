# LfA Förderbank Bayern



**LfA Förderbank Bayern** is the regional promotional bank (German: *Förderbank*) for the German state of Bavaria. It was established by law of 7 December 1950, initially as *Landesanstalt für Aufbaufinanzierung* (LfA), which makes it the oldest of the *Förderbanken*. It is headquartered in Munich.


## Overview

LfA started operations on 1 May 1951. It provides financing for start-ups, environmental protection, and other areas deemed of public interest. It does not compete with commercial banks but co-lends or co-invests with them and provides guarantees. It also controls investment companies, namely *BayBG Bayerische Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH* and *Bayern Kapital GmbH*. In July 2021, the latter was entrusted with the management of a €200 million scale-up fund at the initiative of the Bavarian state government.

Together with other *Förderbanken* and the more commercially oriented Landesbanken, LfA Förderbank Bayern is a member of the Association of German Public Banks (VÖB). Since September 2023, it has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact.
