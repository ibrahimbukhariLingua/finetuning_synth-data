# Buy It Now



***Buy It Now*** is a business reality television series where people pitch their product ideas to investors and potential customers for the chance to have their products sold on Amazon. It is hosted by J. B. Smoove. The show is by Studio Lambert and Amazon MGM Studios, with executive production by Susan House, Jack Burgess, Tim Harcourt, and Stephen Lambert.


## Premise

The Wall Street Journal has described the show as "*Shark Tank* meets Home Shopping Network". Contestants have 90 seconds to convince a live studio audience of 100 everyday customers, as well as a panel of three esteemed judges, to take a liking with their products. If the contestant has 10 green lights or above, after announcing about the products price, and getting two approvals from the panel, their product will be sold and featured in the "Buy It Now" store on Amazon. One contestant from each episode also wins $20,000.
