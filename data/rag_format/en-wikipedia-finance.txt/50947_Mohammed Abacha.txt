Mohammed Abacha


# Mohammed Abacha



**Mohammed Abacha** is the eldest surviving son of Nigeria's former *military ruler*, the late general Sani Abacha, and his wife Maryam Abacha.


## Money laundering

During his father's military rule, Mohammed Abacha was involved in looting the government. A preliminary report published by the Abdulsalami Abubakar transitional government in November 1998 described the process. Sani Abacha told his National Security Adviser Ismaila Gwarzo to provide fake funding requests, which Abacha approved. The funds were usually sent in cash or travellers' cheques by the Central Bank of Nigeria to Gwarzo Kuncnoni, who took them to Abacha's house. Mohammed Abacha then arranged to launder the money to offshore accounts.
An estimated $1.4 billion in cash was delivered in this way.


## Legacy

Like his father and mother, Mohammed Abacha has been referenced in 419 scams.
