## History

In February 1940, Delta Employees Credit Union was formed in Atlanta, Georgia, by eight Delta Air Lines employees, each with a stake of $45 in share capital. On March 8, 1940, Delta Employees Credit Union received a charter entitling it to 20 years of operation. One month later, the first board of directors was composed. The board voted that membership was open to all Delta employees. By the end of 1940 assets were approximately $2,000.

In 1960, the board granted a renewal of the credit union's charter. By 1983, assets were +$200M. Delta Employees Credit Union was then and is now the largest credit union in Georgia.

On March 8, 1990, Delta Employees Credit Union held its 50th anniversary.

In July 1994, the credit union implemented a policy of "Once a member, always a member," thus eliminating the stipulation that an individual had to be an active Delta employee to be a member. Membership was also extended to the parents of active and former Delta employees in good standing. In 1995 the Delta Employees Credit Union's total number of members exceeded the 100,000 mark. Membership privileges were offered to children, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers and sisters of the member and their spouses. In 2001, domestic partners of members were added.

In October 2005, Delta Employees Credit Union changed their name to Delta Community Credit Union to describe that they were open to the metro Atlanta community, not just Delta Air Line employees.

In 2010, Delta Community offered Mobile Banking as an option to members.

In 2013, Hank Halter was appointed President and CEO of Delta Community Credit Union and named an Atlanta top 100 leaders in finance by the Atlanta Business Chronicle.
