Developments in Dubai


# Developments in Dubai



The government of Dubai took a decision to diversify from a trade-based, oil-reliant economy to one that is service and tourism-oriented. This has made real estate and other developments more valuable, thus resulting in a property boom from 2004 to 2006. Construction on a large scale has turned Dubai into one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. There are a number of large-scale projects which are currently under construction or are to be constructed in the future. Due to the heavy construction which is taking place in Dubai, 30,000 construction cranes, which are 25% of cranes worldwide, are operating in Dubai. Due to the burst of construction, Dubai has acquired various building-related records, which include: the world's tallest tower (Burj Khalifa), the world's largest shopping mall (Dubai Mall), the world's largest fountain (The Dubai Fountain) and the world's tallest hotel (Gevora Hotel). Also under construction is Dubailand, which will be almost twice the size of the Walt Disney World Resort.

In 2009, many construction real estate projects were suspended or abandoned due to the Great Recession. That has also caused property prices to fall considerably throughout the United Arab Emirates, but most notably in Dubai. A Real Estate Regulatory Agency study found that over 200 projects had been canceled between 2009 and 2011. In 2013 Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum created a committee to consider liquidating stalled building projects to pay off investors.

A 2022 study by economists who had access to leaked Dubai real estate data on 800,000 properties found at least $146 billion in foreign wealth invested in the Dubai property market, which is twice as much as all the real estate held in the United Kingdom by foreigners through shell companies. The study found that approximately 20% of offshore Dubai real estate is owned by Indians whereas 10% is owned by the British, and that an "a number of conflict-ridden countries and autocracies have large holdings in Dubai relative to the size of their economy." By cross-comparing the leaked data with Norwegian administrative data, the study found that 70% of the properties owned by Norwegians in Dubai were not reported in Norwegians tax returns, which raised questions about Dubai real estate investments as a form of tax evasion.


## Areas in redevelopment


### Port Rashid


### Dubai World Trade Centre


## Completed developments


### Burj Khalifa

The **Burj Khalifa** (Arabic: برج خليفة for "Khalifa Tower") is a supertall skyscraper in the "Downtown Dubai" area of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building is part of a huge development located at the "First Interchange" (aka "Defense round-about") along Sheikh Zayed Road at Doha Street. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM) of Chicago is the lead architect, structural engineer, and mechanical engineer of the Burj. George J. Efstathiou of SOM is the Managing Partner on the project, while Adrian Smith, formerly of SOM, was the Design Partner. Third-Party Review has been performed by CBM Engineers Inc. It is the tallest structure in the world.

Several other mega-projects in various states of planning and construction may vie for the title of "tallest structure". One of Burj Khalifa's main competitors was planned for a location only 50 km (31 mi) from the Burj Khalifa site. Nakheel Tower was being developed by Nakheel Properties, which would have been around 1,400 m (4,600 ft), but the project was cancelled in December 2009.

The Burj Khalifa has been designed to be the centerpiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that includes 30,000 homes, nine hotels such as the Burj Dubai Lake Hotel & Serviced Apartments, 2.5 hectares (6 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12 hectare man-made Burj Dubai Lake. The 500-acre (2.0 km²) development cost about US$20 billion. The tower covers a total of two million m² (22 million ft²) of development.

The silvery glass-sheathed concrete building restored the title of Earth's tallest structure to the Middle East — a title not held by the region since Lincoln Cathedral upset the four millennial reign of Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza in AD 1311.

Burj Khalifa Heights, the world's highest post office, has been opened on the 148th floor of Burj Khalifa. The development has been undertaken to celebrate the launch of AED 3 official stamp, which features picture of the building and marks its 6th anniversary.

Although it features the usual amenities for a mall (a fourteen-screen movie theater, a gaming arena, a typical variety of stores, and a soon-to-be-completed dramatic theater), its biggest claim to fame is the Middle East's first indoor ski slope, **Ski Dubai**.
