Initially, Schaumayer worked at the highly regarded Creditanstalt, where she became authorized signatory in 1961. She was also a member of the Viennese Association of Academics. From 1965 to 1973, Schaumayer was a member of the city council and regional government of Vienna, nominated by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). She was responsible for municipal enterprises and building regulations and other technical matters. From 1969 to 1982, she also served in the Municipal Council and Landtag of Vienna.

After the 1973 elections, she left the state government and in May 1974 become a vorstand of *Kommunalkredit AG*, a specialist bank in Vienna, which specialized in public infrastructure projects. In 1982, she was appointed as the CFO of OMV. In 1990, she was appointed Governor of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank. On her 60th birthday in 1991, she founded the Dr. Maria Schaumayer Foundation, with the aim of actively supporting the careers of women in business and science and promoting research into and improving the framework conditions for such careers. During her term in office, the salaries of the central bankers were also drastically cut. Her own salary was reduced from nine to six million schillings (440,000 euros) as a result of the reform.

At the beginning of 1995, she left the central bank. Starting in 2000, she served as a government representative for the compensation of forced laborers under the Nazi regime.
