## Biography

Born in Longmont, Colorado, Dehning moved to Boulder, Colorado in 1983 where he attended the University of Colorado. He was first admitted to CU's engineering school, but eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Science in finance. After graduating from CU Dehning went to work for State Farm Insurance as a claims adjuster before returning to school to pursue a Master of Science in accounting. During graduate school Dehning worked as an accounting information systems consultant for small businesses, and as an assistant hall director in CU’s Arnett and Smith dormitories.

After finishing his master's degree Dehning stayed at CU to pursue a PhD in accounting, working primarily with Marlys and Bob Lipe. His dissertation was a behavioral finance experiment titled, "Prospect Theory as an Explanation for the Observed Characteristics of the Returns–Earnings Relation". His dissertation committee consisted of: Marlys Lipe, chair, Robert Lipe, Barry Lewis, and Gary McClelland of the University of Colorado, and Donald Moser of the University of Pittsburgh.

After graduation Dehning took an assistant professor position at the University of New Hampshire in 1998, after completing one year there ABD as an instructor. At UNH Dehning met an economist and management information systems (MIS) scholar, Theophanis Stratopoulos, who changed Dehning’s career by introducing him to MIS issues closely related to accounting and accounting information systems. Dehning and Stratopoulos collaborated on eight refereed publications and numerous national and international conference presentations and proceedings. It was at one of these conferences that Dehning met Vernon J. Richardson, now of the University of Arkansas, who introduced Dehning to Robert W. Zmud of the University of Oklahoma. Together Dehning, Richardson, and Zmud published two articles in the premier journals *MIS Quarterly* and the *Journal of Operations Management*. Dehning and Richardson also have several other top-tier publications together and with other collaborators.

Dehning left UNH for Chapman University in 2002 in order to further his possibilities for outstanding scholarly activity. Soon after arriving at Chapman, Dehning began a publication streak of 13 articles in four years, leading to him receiving the Wang–Fradkin Professorship at Chapman University in 2004. Dehning took a leave from Chapman in 2005 to spend six months in the Czech Republic teaching and doing research at Tomas Bata University in Zlín, and teaching at the Institute of Finance and Administration in Prague. While teaching at the Institute of Finance and Administration in Prague, Dehning met Dr. Alan Kraustengl, who later went on to become president of Anglo American University in Prague. This relationship led to the establishment of Chapman University’s Prague campus where currently the school offers its highly regarded MBA program.
