Foreign Economic Administration


# Foreign Economic Administration



In the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the **Foreign Economic Administration** (FEA) was formed on September 25, 1943 to relieve friction between US agencies operating abroad.


## Establishment

The FEA was organized and run by Leo Crowley who was described by his biographer Stuart L. Weiss as "The Nation's #1 Pinch-hitter". Weiss summed up Crowley's management style this way: "Based on his own success in Washington, he had concluded that sound administration meant clearly demarcating lines of authority between agencies and, within each, finding the right staff and giving it only the most basic guidance and coordination".¹⁶²

Weiss' evidence for Crowley's hand in creating the FEA is a memo he sent to James Byrnes on September 21, 1943, giving his "assessment of the conflict and confusion among the economic agencies operating abroad." His lengthy memorandum argued that "the major culprit was the State Department, which interfered with (or micromanaged) the execution of policy when it should only formulate and coordinate it. That led to problems in the field, ranging from wasteful duplication or the more critical problems of needless delays and confusion".¹⁶²

Weiss explains: "The British … were complaining of difficulty in dealing with 'conflicting jurisdictions' in North Africa; and the New York Times was emphasizing 'uncertainty regarding the representative spheres of OEW (Office of Economic Warfare), Lend-Lease, and OFRRO (Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation Operations) … friction between OEW and the War Food Administration as regards foreign food purchases".¹⁶¹

According to the *New York Times*, September 26, 1943, on the occasion of the establishment of the FEA, Roosevelt said that [Crowley is] "one of the best administrators in or out of government, [whom] I find great satisfaction in promoting … to a position which will centralize all foreign economic operations in one operating agency".¹⁶³

When the war was over, Harry Truman closed down the FEA. As he explained in his *Memoirs*, "When the FEA had been formed in 1943 as a wartime agency, the move involved a merger of all or parts of forty-three different agencies. The functions and services with which it had been charged were such that it could not be stopped suddenly. ... I issued an Executive Order on September 27 terminating the FEA ... not later than December 31, 1945".⁴⁷⁷

In 2007 Martin Lorenz-Meyer published a book that investigated one of FEA's public programs. Naturally the author sketches the career of administrator Leo Crowley (p. 22,25,26) and his organization of the FEA:

In 1955 Harry Truman recounted in detail in his *Memoirs* an early incident in the breakdown in the alliance with Russia after the war:
