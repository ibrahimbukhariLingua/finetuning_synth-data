National Budget of Bangladesh


# National Budget of Bangladesh



The **National Budget of Bangladesh** is the government's annual financial statement, outlining the projected income and expenditure for the fiscal year. According to Article 87.(1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh, presenting this budget is a mandatory duty of the government. It is the annual budget of the People's Republic of Bangladesh set by Ministry of Finance for the following financial year, with the revenues to be gathered by National Board of Revenue (NBR) to identify planned government spending and expected government revenue and the expenditures of the public sector, to forecast economic conditions in compliance with government policy.

After gaining independence in 1971, Bangladesh's first budget was presented by Tajuddin Ahmad in 1972, totaling ৳786 crore (US$67 million). Former Finance Ministers AMA Muhith and Saifur Rahman each presented 12 budgets during their respective tenures, marking the highest number of budgets in the country's history. The 2024-25 budget marked the 53st in Bangladesh's history and was the 25th budget presented by an Awami League-led government.

His first budget notably raised the minimum income tax threshold for individual taxpayers from ৳8,400 to ৳10,000. The second budget introduced measures allowing the legalization of "black money" without penalties. In his third budget, Zia announced the implementation of new pay scales.


### Mirza Nurul Huda

Mirza Nurul Huda presented his sole budget during the 1979-80 fiscal year, amounting to ৳3,317 crore. This budget was significant as it was the first to be presented in the House after a three-year gap. A key focus of Huda's budget was on enhancing direct taxation as a means of revenue generation.


### Saifur Rahman (First Tenure)

M Saifur Rahman holds the record for presenting the most budgets in Bangladesh's history. In his first two budgets, he introduced significant measures to enhance tax compliance and regulate imports. In his inaugural budget for the 1980-81 fiscal year, which totaled ৳4,108 crore, Saifur made it mandatory for individuals with an income exceeding ৳20,000 to file tax returns on time, with penalties imposed for non-compliance. In his second budget, he introduced a 50% reduction in duties on computers and imposed a 1% development surcharge on all imports.


### A M A Muhith (First Tenure)

His budgets introduced significant social security programs, including old-age allowances, aimed at providing a safety net for vulnerable populations.

### Saifur Rahman (Third Tenure)

M Saifur Rahman, in his third term, introduced five budgets that focused on comprehensive economic reforms and addressed several key fiscal issues. His tenure saw renewed emphasis on combating black money laundering, alongside reforms that included mandatory submission of tax returns for election candidates and those participating in government tenders. The scope of VAT collection was expanded, and the tax-free income limit was increased to ৳0.15 million. Additionally, the infrastructure development surcharge of 4% was removed, aiming to reduce the financial burden on businesses and consumers.

These initiatives are part of the broader goal to transition towards a “Smart Bangladesh.” Kamal presented his final budget during a period of global economic recession and post-pandemic recovery, with growing inflation and concerns about foreign currency reserves.
