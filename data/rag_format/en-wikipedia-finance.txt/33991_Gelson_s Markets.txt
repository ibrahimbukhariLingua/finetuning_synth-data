Gelson's Markets


# Gelson's Markets



**Gelson's** is an American regional supermarket chain operating in Southern California. It operates service-oriented stores mostly in upscale neighborhoods.


## History

According to the chain's website, the chain likely originated around the 1929 stock market crash. In 1948, Arden Farms Company merged Mayfair Markets and 48 California Van Markets into a new chain called "Mayfair Markets." By the mid-1960s, it had expanded to neighboring states with over 250 stores. However, as larger supermarkets gained popularity, most of these stores were sold off. Eventually, upscale Mayfair stores were renovated and became Gelson's branches.

The first Gelson's supermarket was opened in July 1951 by Bernard and Eugene Gelson. The second store opened in 1960 in Encino and the third store opened in 1965 in North Hollywood.

In 1966, Arden Group acquired Gelson's.

In February 2014, Arden Group sold Gelson's to TPG Capital for $394 million.

In 2015, the company acquired 8 stores from Haggen for $36 million.

In November 2017, Bob Mariano joined the board of directors of the company.

In February 2021, Gelson's Markets was acquired by Pan Pacific International Holdings (PPIH), the parent company of Japanese retailers Don Quijote and Marukai Corporation.
