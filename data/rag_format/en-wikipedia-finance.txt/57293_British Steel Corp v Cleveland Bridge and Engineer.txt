British Steel Corp v Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd


# British Steel Corp v Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd



***British Steel Corp v Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Co Ltd*** [1984] 1 All ER 504 is an English contract law case concerning agreement.


## Facts

Steel nodes were delivered to the defendants after a letter of intent to buy, but no formal contract had been concluded because the claimants refused to use the defendantsâ€™ terms, and negotiations took so long. No agreement was reached on progress payments and liability for late delivery, and defendants refused to pay because of lateness and nodes coming out of sequence. British Steel Corp sued to recover the money, and Cleveland Bridge sought damages for the late payment.


## Judgment

Robert Goff J's judgment accepted that a letter of intent *could* amount to an executory contract, but it did not in this case due to the negotiations being ongoing. The court considered but rejected the submission that the defendants' terms could have amounted to a standing offer that could be accepted by starting the work. Instead, the court decided that no contract had been entered into, and only allowed the claimants to get restitutionary recovery on a *quantum meruit* basis for the value of the work done. The conclusion that no contract existed meant the defendants could not recover the damages for late performance as no terms had been agreed to that extent.
