## History

Smyths started out as a family newsagent on Main Street, Claremorris, County Mayo in 1935 before branching out into toys in 1986. The original newsagent's shop in Claremorris remained in business under the Smyth's brand until late 2023.

The company is run by three brothers, Tony, Padraig and Thomas Smyth. A fourth brother and director, Liam, died in July 2023. Smyths is the UK and Ireland's largest toy retailer.


### Expansion to central Europe

On 24 April 2018, Smyths acquired Toys "R" Us shops in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In 2019, all the remaining shops in those countries were rebranded to Smyths.

In July 2022, Smyths acquired French toy chain PicWicToys [fr] in France out of receivership, taking over 41 shops, 2 warehouses and a head office.
