Investment and Development Agency of Latvia


# Investment and Development Agency of Latvia



The **Investment and Development Agency of Latvia** (**LIAA**) is Latvia's investment promotion agency. It was established in 1993 under the Ministry of Economics of the Republic of Latvia.


## Foreign trade

LIAA organizes business trips to foreign countries, which include business forums, workshops, entrepreneur roundtable discussions, contact exchanges, trade fairs, and individual meetings with potential business partners.

LIAA organizes export seminars that deal with exports and provide information on news and trends in foreign markets, as well as the European Single Market.


## Tourism

In 2016, the Tourism Development State Agency (TAVA) was added to LIAA. The aim of the department is to promote Latvian tourism products and services.


## Business incubators

In October 2016, 11 business incubators and 9 support units were active in Latvia (Bauska, Daugavpils, Jelgava, Jēkabpils, Jūrmala, Kuldīga, Liepāja, Madona, Ogre, Rēzekne, Sigulda, Talsi, Valmiera, Ventspils, and a creative industries incubator in Riga).

In 2024, the LIAA was forced to stop providing funding to startups, due to the Economic Ministry's failure to introduce legal amendments required by the updated EU "de minimis" regulation.
