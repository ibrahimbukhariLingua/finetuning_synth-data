Since its inception in 1966, ADB presidents have all been Japanese and although there was talk of a Chinese challenge, Nakao remained the sole nominee for the post. He was unanimously elected president by the Board of Governors of the ADB and assumed office on April 28, 2013. In August 2016, the ADB Board appointed Nakao to a new five-year term, which began on November 24, 2016.

As ADB President, Nakao identified securing financial resources for the ADB and promoting public-private partnerships as focus areas and called for a “more innovative, more inclusive and more integrated” development of the Asia-Pacific region. During his period as president, the ADB continued its focus on infrastructure, environment, regional integration, inclusiveness and gender equality, cofinancing initiatives and internal reforms to overcome the ADB's resource crunch and to streamline its performance.

In January 2020, Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte awarded Nakao the Order of Sikatuna, the Philippines' highest civilian recognition, with the rank of Grand Cross, or Datu, in recognition of his services to the Philippines in supporting the national development program during his period as president of ADB.
