## History

The company was formed in 1976 by Michael Page and Bill McGregor, who placed accountants into permanent positions in the United Kingdom. Initially, the pair worked in London, but by 1979 had opened offices in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds and Bristol.

In 1985, an office was opened in Australia, and the organisation opened in France in 1986. In 1983, Michael Page International was first listed on the Unlisted Securities Market. Michael Page was admitted to the London Stock Exchange in 1988.

Michael Page retired in 1995, with Terry Benson appointed as Chief Executive in 1990. In 1997, the company was acquired by Spherion Corporation (formerly *Interim Services Inc.*).

PageGroup was demerged from Spherion Corporation in 2001. In 2006, Terry Benson resigned, and Steve Ingham was appointed Chief Executive.

In October 2012, Michael Page International rebranded as PageGroup.
