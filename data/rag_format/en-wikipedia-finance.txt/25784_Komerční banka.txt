## History

The bank was founded in 1990 following separation of commercial activities from the former State Bank of Czechoslovakia. In 1992, the bank was partially privatized in voucher privatization.

In 2001, the state’s 60% holding in Komerční banka was purchased by Société Générale. Following privatization, KB began significantly to develop its activities for individual customers and entrepreneurs, in addition to building on its traditionally strong position in the enterprises and municipalities market.

In 2014 the Komerční banka signed a partnership with the National Gallery in Prague.

In 2020 Komerční banka acquired 96% of Upvest, which was founded in 2017 and is based in Prague.

In 2021, the bank had 241 branches and operated 857 ATMs.

In January 2021, Komerční banka announced that, in cooperation with Syncordis, it will begin the transition to a new software platform from Temenos, with the aim of achieving the reference level for the digitization of banking services in the Czech Republic. According to Komerční banka's CEO Jan Juchelka, this is a crucial Investment for the bank and is supposed to improve the customer experience. Komerční banka's partnership with Syncordis includes the supply and implementation of the banking software.

In 2022 Komerční banka launched an initiative to make all Czech banks cooperate with each other in using and sharing a single ATM network instead of each bank having its own. This means that only one ATM will be required, which customers of all participating banks can use without additional fees. The network started with only Komerční banka and Moneta Money Bank as part of it, until UniCredit Bank and Air Bank joined them in February 2023.
