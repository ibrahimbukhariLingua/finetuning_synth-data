Costa Rican peso


# Costa Rican peso



The **peso** was the currency of Costa Rica between 1850 and 1896. It was initially subdivided into 8 *reales* and circulated alongside the earlier currency, the real, until 1864, when Costa Rica decimalized and the peso was subdivided into 100 *centavos*. The peso was replaced by the colón at par in 1896


## Coins

In 1850, silver coins were issued in denominations of 1⁄16, 1⁄8 and 1⁄4 peso. In 1864, silver coins were introduced in denominations of 25 centavos and 1 peso. These were followed the next year by cupro-nickel 1⁄2 and 1 centavos and silver 5, 10 and 50 centavos, with gold 2, 5 and 10 pesos introduced by 1870. In 1889, Colombian 50 centavo coins were counterstamped and issued as 50 centavo coins in Costa Rica.
