## Legal issues


### Dow Jones

On 1 May 2007, News Corporation made a public announcement of its bid for Dow Jones & Company. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission filed an initial complaint seven days later naming Wong Kan-king and his wife Charlotte, both residents of Hong Kong, as defendants after its investigation of suspicious share price movements in the run-up to the announcement. The SEC alleged that the couple purchased 415,000 shares through a Merrill Lynch Hong Kong account between 13 and 30 April, and had reaped a US$8.2 million profit on disposal following announcement of the bid.

The SEC later filed an amended complaint ("The First Amended Complaint") identifying the source of the information as David Li, who had obtained the information by being a board member of Dow Jones. The SEC alleged that Li had informed his close friend and business associate Michael Leung, who in turn told his daughter and son-in-law. The amended complaint added David Li and Michael Leung as co-defendants and details how Leung traded through the account of his daughter and son-in-law with their assistance.

At the end of January 2008, a settlement was reached where Li was ordered to pay an $8.1 million civil penalty, Leung to pay $8.1 million in disgorgement and an $8.1 million penalty; K. K. Wong would pay $40,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a $40,000 civil penalty. Li would neither admit nor deny any wrongdoing.

Li's integrity is being questioned by Legislators, and corporate gadfly David Webb was the first to put Li under pressure to relinquish his position as a member of both the Legislative and the Executive Councils of Hong Kong because of his implication in the affair. Several other legislators added to the pressure for Li to relinquish his cabinet (Exco) position, although there are divergent views on his continued LegCo membership. On 17 February 2008, Li announced his resignation from Exco.


### Donald Tsang Yam-kuen

In January 2017, prosecutors claimed that, in July 2010, Li had assisted the then Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Donald Tsang Yam-kuen (through Tsang's wife) in the latter's attempt to cover up an alleged corrupt deal to secure a super-luxury apartment in Shenzhen, by drawing a HK$350,000 cash cheque and passing the money to Tsang's wife.


## Awards and recognition

Li was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1991 New Year Honours. In 2001, he was awarded the Gold Bauhinia Star by the government of Hong Kong.

In the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was made a Knight Bachelor by the United Kingdom for his contributions to British education. He also has honorary doctorates from the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Li was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal in 2007.
