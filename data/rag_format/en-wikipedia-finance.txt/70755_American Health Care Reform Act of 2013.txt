# American Health Care Reform Act of 2013



The **American Health Care Reform Act of 2013** (H.R. 3121) is a bill introduced to the 113th United States Congress.


## Background

All Republicans in the United States House of Representatives opposed the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) championed by President Barack Obama. After gaining control of the House following the 2010 elections, they moved to "repeal and replace" the ACA. Opponents offered alternatives including the Patient's Choice Act of 2009, Empowering Patients First Act of 2009 and 2013. Rep. Steve Scalise chaired the 175-member Republican Study Committee which produced the draft of the American Health Care Reform Act. Rep. Scalise told reporters, "I think we’ve done a very effective job of pointing out all the things that are bad about the president’s health-care law, but people want to know what we stand for as well."

## Procedural history

H.R. 3121 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on September 18, 2013 under the short title "American Health Care Reform Act of 2013" as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. The bill was introduced by Rep. David P. Roe (R, TN-1). It was referred to the United States House Rules Committee, Committee on Appropriations, Committee on House Administration, Natural Resources Committee, House Judiciary Committee, Education and the Workforce Committee, Ways and Means Committee, and Energy and Commerce Committee on the same day it was introduced. The Energy Committee sent it to the Subcommittee on Health on September 20. The Natural Resources Committee sent it to the Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native\_Affairs on September 23. On October 15, the Judiciary Committee sent it to both the Subcommittees on Constitution and Civil Justice and Regulatory Reform, Commercial And Antitrust Law.


## Debate and discussion

Critics of H.R. 3121 note that it would include repealing the Affordable Care Act in its entirety.

The use of Health Savings Accounts in the American Health Care Act has been criticized as of limited value to low income Americans, who would not be able to take advantage of the provision.

The Act uses state-run high-risk pools to assist people with pre-existing conditions, which could be excluded from insurance coverage upon repeal of the Affordable Care Act. These pools have typically required high rates, which may make them unaffordable for individuals with low incomes. H.R. 3121 would appropriate $25 billion to be spent over 10 years (or an average of $2.5 billion annually) to subsidize the high risk pools. The cost of covering pre-existing conditions was estimated to be between $15 and $20 billion per year, according to a 2010 National Affairs article. The bill would allow individuals to move between insurance plans and not be without coverage, including coverage for pre-existing conditions.

H.R. 3121 would attempt to create a more competitive health care market to control prices. This would be achieved through allowing insurance policies to be sold across state lines, prevent a single insurance carrier from dominating the market in any one state, and provide a website for comparing insurance plans, and prevention of federal funding of abortions. Small businesses would be allowed to pool together to negotiate lower rates. The bill strives to achieve affordable health care and increased access, but without mandates or tax increases.

It has been predicted that allowing purchase of insurance across state lines without national requirements for coverage would create a "race to the bottom." The insurance companies would try to reduce how much they would need to charge for their plans by limiting coverage. If individuals choose to purchase primarily on the cost of the plan, many people could end up with insurance offers very little coverage.

The bill would reform medical malpractice laws, including limiting non-economic damages to $250,000, in an effort to reduce costs of healthcare. Critics have noted that medical liability costs represent only about 2.4% of health care spending, so reforms will have minimal impact.

The Act consists of less than 200 pages, as compared to the 2,700-page Affordable Care Act. Supporters believe this bill to be less complex, and easier to understand and define.
