He is also the chairman of the Euroamerica Foundation and the vice-chairman of the Reina Sofia National Museum. He is on the board of several institutions, including PRISA and Renta Corporaci√≥n.


## Views

When they were in office both Solchaga and his predecessor Miguel Boyer implemented economic policies based the orthodox liberal ideas, and the social outcomes of these policies were largely neglected. Solchaga continued Boyer's moderation and orthodox economy approach. It was partly because they did not fit into the socialist mould the government projected. Their priority was to reduce inflation using steps to control the money supply, which reinforced the high levels of interest and a strong currency. In addition, like Boyer he objected the approach and views of Alfonso Guerra, deputy prime minister.
