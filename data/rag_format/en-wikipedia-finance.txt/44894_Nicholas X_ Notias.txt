## AEK Athens involvement

With AEK struggling terribly in corruption and the prospect of relegation to the fourth division looming, Demis Nikolaidis (ex club charismatic player) supported by the majority of AEK fans, established a consortium of businessmen such as Polys V. Hajioannou, Petros Pappas and Takis Kanellopoulos, who convinced Nikos Notias to participate in the project. The approach was made by Ghikas Goumas, grandson of the late Nikos Goumas (former President of the club). At the first contact, which was held in New York City, Nikos Notias was convinced that the operators had pure purposes, and a great vision for the club's regeneration. Small doubts initially led Notias to take a small percentage of shares (about 8%) but he changed his mind quickly, when he realized that the fans totally backed-up the effort and gradually, over a period of three and a half years, he became the major holder of the shares, reaching 35%. His financial assistance to the club amounts to 18 million euros but the largest and most expected project of Nikos Notias, remains the club's Sports Center which will cost over 25 million euros. It will be the biggest project in the modern history of the club and Notias's intention is to name it "Harry Notias" in honour of his father. Among the tremendous economic crisis in Greece and due to the club's financial problems, AEK Athens in June 2013 declared bankruptcy and was self-relegated to the amateur third division. The Athletic Center of Spata nowadays includes state of the art facilities, three fields (one of them with synthetic turf) for soccer, a fitness and health center with weight-training and fitness rooms, a cryotherapy center and more. Unfortunately, the rest of the project (the club's Museum, Hotel, Aquatic Center and two more soccer fields) could not be delivered and remained unfinished.
