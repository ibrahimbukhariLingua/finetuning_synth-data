### Business and political activism

In 2004, Brinkmann set up the Continent Europe Foundation, which included far-right leaders in various European countries. Its board included two leaders of the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany. Its goals were opposing immigration and Americanism, and supporting a white "pan-European civilization", according to German intelligence. *Der Spiegel* reported in 2008 that Brinkmann had moved the foundation's operations from a post office box address in Jönköping, Sweden, to a villa in Berlin bought by his wife, and that Brinkmann was "a leading figure in the international far-right scene". Neighbors in Berlin noticed visitors with limousines and bodyguards at the villa. Brinkmann and the foundation organized conferences and collaborations between activists, academics, and writers. Among others, Mikhail Gorbachev's former adviser Professor Wjatscheslaw Iwanowitsch Daschitschew played a role,ᵇᵉᵗᵗᵉʳˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ as Brinkmann advocated a rapprochement between Europe and Russia.

In 2011, Brinkmann facilitated discussions between European and Israeli right-wing political figures, aiming to foster dialogue and exchange of perspectives. As part of this effort, he orchestrated a visit to the Knesset with representatives from parties such as the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) and the Sweden Democrats, while representing the Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang from Belgium in these negotiations. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who has since been proposed as the U.S. Ambassador to Israel under the newly elected administration, was also a key participant in these discussions. The efforts caused controversies in Israel and Europe.

This controversy was likely a contributing factor in Brinkmann’s decision to withdraw from politics in 2011 and instead focusses on his businesses, which he said suffered from the attention surrounding his political activities.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ When former Minister Sven-Otto Littorin joined the Board of Wiking Mineral in 2012 it caused a stir in the Swedish press, which ended with Littorin reporting Expressen to the Press Ombudsman.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

Brinkmann said he had changed some of his views and opinion toward a more pro-Islam stance, stating that "The Muslim view on families supports a positive demographic development and is good as counterpoint to all the single men in the Sweden Democrats party". Brinkmann attributed his changed views to "having gotten to know some immigrants of the Muslim faith".
