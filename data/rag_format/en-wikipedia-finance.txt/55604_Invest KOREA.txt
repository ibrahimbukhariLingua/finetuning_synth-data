## History

In July 1998, Invest KOREA's predecessor, the Korea Investment Service Center (KISC) was established in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis as part of the liberalization of the Korean investment regime.

In December 2003, the Foreign Investment Center was re-launched as Invest KOREA.
