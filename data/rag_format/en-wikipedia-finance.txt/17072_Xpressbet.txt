## History

In April 1983, the Meadows, the first pari-mutuel horse racing track in Western Pennsylvania, launched Call-A-Bet, which allowed patrons to wager through personal telephone accounts. In November 1983, the Meadows Racing Network, a satellite television station that pumped a 12-race card into 270,000 Pennsylvania homes and complemented the Call-A-Bet system, was introduced. 18% stake of the Meadows Racing Network was later sold to Toronto-based Magna Entertainment Corp (MEC) as part of a $53 million deal. Frank Stronach, the chairman of Magna, said, "The acquisition of the Call-A-Bet account wagering system, together with Ladbroke's other Pennsylvania horse racing operations, is an important step in MEC's strategic plan of building the premier account wagering business in the country. By acquiring the existing Call-A-Bet system, which already has a profitable operating history, MEC will significantly advance its electronic media strategy and realize an immediate improvement in its earnings per share."

Call-A-Bet later added an internet wagering service and was renamed to XpressBet. In March 2002, Ron Luniewski, then co-chief executive officer of online advance-deposit wagering company called Youbet.com (later acquired by Churchill Downs), resigned to serve as CEO of XpressBet.

On April 20, 2018, Ron Luniewski left the company. As of his exit, XpressBet's handle grew to $782.6 million in 2017.
