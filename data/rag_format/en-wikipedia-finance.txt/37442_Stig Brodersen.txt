## Professional career

Brodersen has studied numerous value investors and was especially drawn to Warren Buffett and his simple but thorough investment strategy. While researching on the American billionaire, Brodersen met fellow Buffett enthusiast Preston Pysh online and decided to collaborate with him. This partnership resulted to 3 books; BuffettBooks.com, an educational site about how to invest like Warren Buffett; and The Investors Podcast, a podcast that studies billionaires and discusses the books those billionaires read. With more than 25 million downloads, The Investors Podcast was hailed by Business Insider as the number 1 finance-related podcast and was recommended by CNBC's *Closing Bell* as the number 1 investing podcast of 2016. Guests of the show have included: Howard Marks, Guy Spier, Tony Robbins and Mohnish Pabrai. Brodersen's own investing approach is heavily inspired by Warren Buffett and Benjamin Grahamâ€™s conservative value investing approach.

Brodersen taught financial management, economics, and accounting courses at Business Academy Aarhus from August 2013 to June 2017. He has been managing his own investment company Stig Brodersen Holding since January 2014.
