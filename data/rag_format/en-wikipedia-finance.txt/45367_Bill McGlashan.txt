He joined the email service company in April 2001, three months into an accounting scandal that caused Critical Path’s stock to drop 75 percent, prompted two dozen shareholder lawsuits, and resulted in criminal charges against four executives. McGlashan was credited with keeping Critical Path out of bankruptcy, eliminating 87 percent of its debt, and settling the lawsuits within three months for $17.5 million, compared to the potential claim total of $240 million and delaying its NASDAQ delisting until shortly after his departure for failing to meet the minimum $15 million market capitalization requirement.

Earlier in his career, McGlashan was a senior associate with Bain Capital and Information Partners.

In 2013, McGlashan relocated temporarily with his family to Mumbai, India, to manage investments in India and Asia. He was said to be “the first global head of a premier bulge bracket (private equity) house physically making such a ‘transformative’ relocation”.

### Legal issues

On March 11, 2019, McGlashan, along with numerous others was arrested for his role in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. After a lengthy FBI investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice charged McGlashan with falsifying his son’s test scores and attempting to secure his son's admission into the University of Southern California by bribing officials into enhancing his son's academic and athletic abilities in a sport he never played so his son's application would be more competitive and be eligible for the school's "side door" admission. A report by CNN stated that "McGlashlan allegedly paid $50,000 to the charitable arm of the college prep group with the understanding that the company would correct his son's answers on the ACT." The allegation against McGlashan resulted in his being fired by TPG. However, McGlashan claims he was "initially put on leave” and “already had resigned” prior to being terminated for cause. However a recent Axios article recently stated, “It seems that McGlashan just can't avoid lying: There's no way he didn't know why his bosses wanted to fire him rather than allowing him to resign.”

On February 10, 2021, McGlashan accepted a plea deal, pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud, conditional on being allowed to appeal the judge’s decision to not dismiss the wire fraud charge against him. He was sentenced to three months in prison and was also ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. Despite being given the option to withdraw his plea, McGlashan issued an apology to the court and voluntarily reported to prison on June 9, 2021, serving out his sentence. McGlashan unsuccessfully appealed the judge's decision in August 2023.
