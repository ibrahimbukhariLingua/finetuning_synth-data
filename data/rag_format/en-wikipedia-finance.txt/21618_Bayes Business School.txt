Bayes Business School


# Bayes Business School



**Bayes Business School**, formerly known as **Cass Business School**, is the business school of City, University of London, located in St Luke's, just to the north of the City of London. It was established in 1966.

Bayes Business School is divided into the three faculties of actuarial science and insurance, finance, and management. It awards BSc (Hons), MSc, MBA, and PhD degrees and is one of around 100 schools globally to be triple accredited by the AMBA in the United Kingdom, EQUIS in Europe, and the AACSB in the United States.


## History

The City University Business School was founded in 1966 as part of City University, London. Its MSc in Administrative Sciences began in 1967 and became the MBA in 1979.

In 2002, following a donation from the Sir John Cass Foundation, the school moved to new premises in the London Borough of Islington and changed its name to Cass Business School.

This was a component of a plan development by David Currie, Baron Currie of Marylebone, the Dean since the previous year, to compete as an international business school in a market dominated by US universities.

The school had previously been spread out across the City of London's mainly residential Barbican Centre development. Half of the £40 million in funding for the new building came from the reserves of City University.

Due to John Cass's links to slavery, the school was renamed Bayes Business School on 6 September 2021, after Thomas Bayes, a nonconformist theologian and mathematician best known for his foundational work on conditional probability.


## Masters courses

The school teaches programmes including insurance and risk management, investment management, corporate finance, banking and International finance, quantitative finance, shipping, marketing, supply chain, energy, trade and finance, property valuation, mathematical trading, real estate, construction management, international accounting and finance, finance and investment, real estate investment, charity management, and business analytics.

The school's MBA is offered full-time through a one-year course, through a two-year part-time Executive MBA, or through a two-year modular Executive MBA.

In September 2007, the business school started the EMBA programme in collaboration with DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre).
