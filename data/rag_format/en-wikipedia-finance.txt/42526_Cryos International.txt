Cryos International


# Cryos International



**Cryos International** is a sperm and egg bank in Aarhus, Denmark. It was founded in 1987 by Ole Schou. The bank has an outpost in Florida in the United States. Both countries allow anonymity of donors. The bank delivers to more than 100 countries. Lesbian couples and single women made up 60% of clients as of September 2017 and sperm prices varied between €40 ($48) and €1,600.


## Controversy

In 2021, Cryos International was the subject of scrutiny following reports from the New York Times of lax international regulations on sperm donation. Dutch serial sperm donor Jonathan Jacob Meijer, accused of having between 500 and 600 children, was registered with Cryos, which does not set limits on the amount of children per donor. In 2019, Cryos International informed a German woman who conceived a child using Meijer's sperm that he had "donated in countries outside of Denmark, therefore breaching the contract he had with Cryos to donate exclusively to our sperm bank".
