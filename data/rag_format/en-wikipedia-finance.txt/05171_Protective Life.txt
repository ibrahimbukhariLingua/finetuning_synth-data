## History

Protective Life Insurance Company was founded in 1907 and paid its first death claim in 1909.

In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National's president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies which continued to do business as Protective.

In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton's son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective. The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states. As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.

In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life. John D. Johns served as president and chief executive officer until 2017 and as chairman of the board from January 2003 to November 2019. Johns was an employee of Protective Life from 1993 until his retirement in November 2019.

In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.

In 2010, Protective life acquired Alabama based life insurance company, United Investors Life Insurance Company from Torchmark.

In 2013, Protective's principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company, completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America. The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.

On July 1, 2017, Rich Bielen became Protective's 7th president and chief executive officer. He joined Protective in 1991 with responsibility for the company's securities portfolio and became chief investment officer and treasurer in 2002. He became vice chairman and chief financial officer in 2007.

In January 2016, Bielen was named president and chief operating officer. On June 1, 2019, Protective closed its largest transaction to date to acquire via reinsurance substantially all of the individual life and annuity business of Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company. The acquisition represented an estimated capital investment of approximately $1.20 billion.

Protective Life has offices in Alabama, Missouri and Kentucky.

Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.
