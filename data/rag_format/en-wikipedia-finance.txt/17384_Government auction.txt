A **government auction** or a **public auction** is an auction held on behalf of a government in which the property to be auctioned is either property owned by the government or property which is sold under the authority of a court of law or a government agency with similar authority.


## Variations

When the term "government auction" is used it often means that a general auctioneer has been contracted to deal with stock that needs to be liquidated by various government bodies:

* Rights to transmit signals on bands of electromagnetic spectrum
* Customs: seized smuggled items
* Defense: military surplus
* Police auction: proceeds of crime
* Post office, transport: lost property
* Warrant sale: assets of debtors
* Tax sale: seized assets
* Court auction: items sold to satisfy a court judgment, like storage contents of not-paying tenants
* Insolvent companies where the government is the liquidator (e.g. official receiver)
* Unowned property

Often goods sold at government auctions will be unreserved, meaning that they will be sold to the highest bidder at the auction.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Auctioneers are normally contracted by the different government organisations within their local area.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Sale of property owned by the government

Government property sold at public auction may include surplus government equipment, abandoned property over which the government has asserted ownership, property which has passed to the government by escheat, government land, and intangible assets over which the government asserts authority, such as broadcast frequencies sold through a spectrum auction.

Public auctions of government property may be conducted by whichever agency is auctioning the property. Some substantial items have been sold at public auction. For example, the United States Navy cruiser Philadelphia was sold at such an auction at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in 1927.

In 2021, GSA offered a 0.7501 share of a bitcoin valued more than $38,000 for an auction. Kevin Kerns, an acting regional administrator of GSA's Southeast Sunbelt Region, stated: *"Whether it’s a car, or a piece of jewelry, or now even cryptocurrency, you never know what kind of treasures you’ll find on GSA Auctions”*. It was the first time ever that GSA auctioned cryptocurrency.


### Sale of private property in a public auction

Private property may be sold in a public auction for a number of reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process to satisfy a judgment rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a mortgage foreclosure, tax lien, or tax sale. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction to satisfy a judgment are distressed – that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In the United States, public auctions to satisfy judgments are usually conducted under the authority of the sheriff of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a **sheriff's sale** or **sheriff sale**.

Real property may be subject to a public auction in order to partition the property between joint tenants who can not agree as to how the property should be divided. An estate sale conducted at the direction of a probate court may also be conducted as a public auction.

### Ancient Roman Empire

In ancient Roman Empire, the maintenance of the public works such as aqueducts, roads, drains, etc. were let out by the censors by public auction to the lowest bidder, just as the vectigalia were let out to the highest bidder. These expenses were called *ultrotributa*, and hence we frequently find *vectigalia* and *ultrotributa* contrasted with one another.
