## History

The post was created in 1667 to relieve the Comptroller of the Navy of one of his original duties. In 1668 The Ticket Office was managed by one of the members of the Navy Board. Its management was taken out of the hands of the Comptroller in 1668 and given to the Controller of Treasurer's Accounts. The Comptrollers of Treasurers' Accounts respectively inspected all the accounts of the money received and paid by the Treasurer of the Navy. In December 1679 the commissioners of the Navy Board ordered a thorough inquiry into naval expenditure resulting in the Controller of Treasurer's Accounts was abolished, and its duties reverted to the Comptroller. In 1691 after a period of internal auditing the office was restored though this time supported by an Assistant Comptroller Treasurers' Accounts. In May 1692 superintendence of the Ticket Office once again relieved the Comptroller of one of his duties and was placed back under the Controller of Treasurer's Accounts office. The post existed until 1796 when the Navy Board was restructured: the post of the three Controllers of Accounts were abolished along with the Clerk of the Acts following recommendations put forward by the Commissioners on Fees who conducted an internal audit within the Navy Office. In 1832 when the Navy Board was abolished responsibility for all accounts and accounting were now administered by the new Department of the Accountant-General of the Navy under the Board of Admiralty.
