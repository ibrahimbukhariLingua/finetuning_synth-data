## Ministerial post

Mauricio Pozo was appointed Minister of Economy and Finance of Ecuador in January 2003, when Lucio Gutiérrez became president. Pozo was described as an "orthodox economist" who advocated dollarization of the national currency. He maintained a policy of using much of the country's oil revenues to repay debt and sought new loans from the IMF. He resigned his post on 1 June 2004, for reasons not clarified at the time. The austerity policies adopted by Pozo and Gutierrez were criticized by representatives of Indigenous people for their impact on poverty, but government supporters linked these policies to a 3.5% growth rate in 2003 and an inflation rate below 3%.
