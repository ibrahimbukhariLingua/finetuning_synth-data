Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management


# Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management



The **Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management** (abbreviated as SBS-EM and also known as simply Solvay) is a school of economics and management, and a Faculty of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), a French-speaking private research university located in Brussels, Belgium. Business education started in 1899, and Solvay was established in 1903 through a donation from the industrialist Ernest Solvay.


## Overview

The roots of the Solvay School stretch back to the founding of the Department of Economics of the Free University of Brussels in 1899, and the founding of the Solvay Business School in 1903. Ernest Solvay founded and funded a business-oriented institution under the name of *École de Commerce Solvay*, as a private initiative established with the support of the Brussels business community.

The Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management was established in 2008 as a result of the merger of the Department of Economics and the Solvay Business School. In 2010, the new entity built a new building on the Solbosch campus and became a full faculty of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB). More than 3,700 students attend some thirty programmes at the School today. Since 2018, its current Dean is Philip Vergauwen, former Dean of the University of Maastricht's School of Business and Economics.


## Campus

The school is located in the Ixelles neighborhood of Brussels on the *Solbosch*, the central and largest campus of the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB). The main building is situated on the corner of the Avenue Franklin Roosevelt/Franklin Rooseveltlaan and the Avenue Jeanne/Johannalaan near the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos, and was built in 2010.

## Research

The Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management is a research-based institution, in two respects. First, the duty of all core faculty members includes the production of scientific output (e.g. publications in peer-review international journals and scientific conferences) and the supervision of PhD candidates. Second, the SBS-EM provides an infrastructure for research, through its three main research centres, the CEB (Centre Emile Bernheim), DULBEA (Department in Applied Economics of ULB), and ECARES (European Centre for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics), and their doctoral schools. Over the past 5 years, many publications have been produced, including 241 articles in international scientific journals and 41 books.

The CEB, ECARES and DULBEA are the main, 'broad-based', research centers affiliated to the SBS-EM. The two additional thematic research centers are CERMi (Centre Européen de Recherche en Microfinance / Center for European Research in Microfinance), and the Centre for Knowledge Economics (Centre de l'économie de la connaissance).

Affiliated to the SBS-EM, CEB is its research institute in management sciences. It aims to develop and promote advanced scientific research in management sciences. The centre hosts more than 75 (full-time and part-time) professors and researchers in key management disciplines. The CEB's teaching and research staff is currently active in the following management fields: accounting, marketing, business strategy, financial markets, corporate management, industrial economics, management of innovation and international trade.

DULBEA was founded by Etienne Sadi Kirschen in the 1950s, based on the new developments taking place in economics and the theory of econometrics. The DULBEA also gives prominence to recommendations in the field of economic policy.

ECARES, founded in 1991, began as a joint political initiative of the ULB Institute of European Studies and the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a network of some 500 researchers in Europe.

CERMi (Centre Européen de Recherche en Microfinance / Center for European Research in Microfinance), draws together researchers, involved in microfinance activities in developing countries, from CEB and from the Research Centre Warocque (Université Mons-Hainaut). The CERMi also collabores with the European Microfinance Programme.

Centre for Knowledge Economics research centre allows the School to bring together all its researchers on a topic. Founded and chaired by Professor Francoise Thys-Clément and Professor of Public Economics.


## Student life

The Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management has an active student life, complementary to the student societies of the Université Libre de Bruxelles:

* Cercle Solvay, the student society of economics
* Bureau Etudiant Solvay, the student government
* Solvay Business Game, the business game
* High School Challenge
* Solvay Mentoring Program

### Solvay Finance Club

One of the youngest organisations is the Solvay Brussels School Student Finance Club, created in 2010. It is a student run organization that aims to offer its members a wide variety of finance related activities, whether it is investment banking, investment management, venture capital/private equity, or corporate finance. The founders' idea was to create a club that prepares its members for careers in the financial field by fostering an environment that helps them to translate their theoretical knowledge into practice, and that stimulates continuous learning and awareness of recent trends and developments. The club offers those pursuing careers in finance a professional and social network. It constitutes an interface between the finance industry and its members.


### Solvay Consulting Club

In 2011, the SBS Student Consulting Club (SCC) was created. Its mission statement is: "The SCC conducts customized consulting services to deliver hands on solutions. It believes in cultivating integer people who drive entrepreneurship in all businesses and strive to functionally develop committed students."
The organization is growing rapidly, both in terms of members and in terms of consulting projects conducted. It won the JADE Belgium Junior Enterprise Challenge in 2012.

The club aims at becoming a Junior Enterprise, which is a certified label by JADE.


### ESTIEM

Besides the programs developed by the school, students also have the opportunity to take part in ESTIEM activities via the Local Group Brussels, part of Cercle Solvay. ESTIEM is the organisation for European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management, whose goal is to establish and foster relations between students across Europe and to support them in their personal and professional development, with a network consisting of 74 local groups in 28 countries, reaching out to 60,000 students.
