Accounting Standards Board (Canada)


# Accounting Standards Board (Canada)



The **Accounting Standards Board** (AcSB) establishes accounting standards for use by private enterprises and private sector not-for-profit organisations in Canada. The AcSB contributes to the development of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) by participating in consultations and activities of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to ensure Canadian publicly accountable entities' financial reporting needs are adequately considered. The AcSB develops and participates in the development of financial reporting standards.

As an independent body, the AcSB is intended to increase client confidence and promote objectivity, assisting organizations to make informed decisions on where best to allocate their financial assets.

* 11 principals
* Two administrative assistants.

The Board is may also periodically hire consultants when the need arises.


## Setting standards

Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are intended to apply to general purposes financial statements that meet common information needs for a range of users, but there are limits to how much latitude GAAP can provide for diversity in practice. As a result, in 2005, the AcSB developed a strategy whereby separate accounting frameworks were adopted for publicly accountable enterprises, private enterprises and private sector not-for-profit organizations as "one size does not fit all."


### International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)

For issues related to publicly accountable enterprises, agenda topics come from the following sources:

* The AcSB adds a topic to its agenda when the IASB activates a project. Work proceeds in parallel with the IASB. The AcSB contributes to the development of IFRSs by participating in consultations and activities of the IASB, as well as providing research for the IASB on certain projects.
* The IFRS Discussion Group, a regular public forum to discuss issues that arise in Canada when applying IFRSs. The Group assists the AcSB in identifying and analyzing these issues so that the Board can raise them with the IASB and IFRS Interpretations Committee.

### Standards for Private Enterprises, Not-for-Profit Organizations and Pension Plans

Accounting standards for private enterprise (ASPE) issues come from many sources, including the following:

* The Private Enterprise Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations to the AcSB on potential changes to accounting standards for private enterprises. The AcSB staff also notifies the Committee of relevant developments in other jurisdictions.
* Committees, the AcSB or members of the public may raise issues, including issues regarding the application of ASPE.

At the AcSB's request, the Committee also reviews each new IFRS and standards developed by other Boards, including the U.S. FASB, and considers whether to recommend that some or all provisions of a standard be included in ASPE.

Not-for-profit organization issues also come from many sources, including:

* proposed changes to accounting standards for private enterprises that also apply to not-for-profit organizations;
* the AcSB/PSAB Joint Not-for-Profit Task Force and its members;
* AcSB members; and
* members of the public.

For matters related to pension plans, AcSB members or members of the public may raise these.
