CNBC Asia


# CNBC Asia



**CNBC Asia** is a Singapore-based business news channel owned by the NBCUniversal Media Group, a subsidiary of Comcast. It is a pan-Asian branch of the U.S.-based CNBC.

The channel initially launched on 20 June 1997 out of Hong Kong. In 1998, the channel merged with Dow Jones' Asia Business News and re-located to its facilities in Singapore. The network maintains bureaus across the Asia–Pacific region.


## History

CNBC Asia was initially announced for a 1995 launch, as a localised version of CNBC for the Asia-Pacific region. The network was expected to feature 10 hours of programming per day from its studio in Hong Kong, along with bureaus in Bombay, Singapore, and Tokyo. The rest of its programming would be sourced from CNBC Europe and its U.S. counterpart. NBC Asia chairman Patrick Cox expected that the network would reach five million homes by the end of its first year on-air. In January 1995, a "preview" known as **ANBC** launched, which carried a mix of programming from CNBC U.S. and CNBC Europe on Galaxy in Australia and Wharf Cable in Hong Kong. CNBC Asia officially launched on 20 June 1995.

The network would be a competitor to the Singapore-based Asia Business News (ABN), a joint venture between Dow Jones & Company, Tele-Communications Inc., TVNZ, and other local investors which launched in 1993. It was doubted whether two competing business news channels in the market would be viable; ABN CEO Paul France derided CNBC Asia as being "an Asian branch of an American company". However, as early as November 1995, it was reported that NBC and Dow Jones were considering a merger of their business news channels in Asia and Europe, including ABN and its European counterpart European Business News (EBN).

In March 1997, CNBC Asia expanded its carriage on cable in India via an agreement with the Hinduja Group.


### Merger with ABN

Renewed negotiations between NBC and Dow Jones surfaced in November 1997 amid financial difficulties at the companies' Asian and European operations. Dow Jones had been operating at a loss of US$48 million, and CNBC at $40 million.

On 10 December 1997, Dow Jones and NBC announced a 15-year strategic partnership, under which ABN and EBN would merge with CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe respectively, and CNBC U.S. would be able to enter into editorial partnerships with Dow Jones publications such as *The Wall Street Journal* and *Barron's*. The merged operation would retain the CNBC branding, but be overseen by Paul France, and re-locate to ABN's Singapore studios—resulting in layoffs of 150 employees from its Hong Kong bureau.

The merger took effect on-air on 2 February 1998, with the channel being rebranded as **CNBC–Asia Business News** for a transitional period. Citing cost issues and a plan to focus exclusively on Asian business news, simulcasts of CNBC U.S. programmes were dropped from its overnight schedule in favour of reruns of domestic programmes. After the decision was poorly received by viewers, CNBC's U.S. business day programmes were reinstated in March.

The merger impacted ABN's Indian network, ABNi, which was a joint venture with Hinduja Group and TV18; prior to the announcement of the Dow Jones agreement, Hinduja had sold its stake in the channel, and TV18's agreement on the venture did not contain any provisions on what would occur in the event of a change in ownership. After discussions with a CNBC lawyer and France, TV18 would reach an agreement with CNBC to serve as its Indian partner, and would also launch CNBC India (now CNBC TV18) the following year.

In October 1999, CNBC Asia had a partnership with the *Australian Financial Review* to present *The Australian Financial Review Market Wrap*, a daily round-up of market news from the Australian region hosted by James Walker and Grace Phan. Major programming changes occurred on 30 October 2000 with CNBC Asia expanding *Asia Squawk Box* to two hours, *Asia Market Watch* to two hours in the morning and 1½ hours in the afternoon and *Power Lunch Asia* to one full hour. CNBC Asia's ticker was also reformatted on that day to include colours reflecting change in the stock prices (green for an increase and red for a decrease) and a stock's ticker symbol.

In 2001, CNBC Asia introduced localised tickers to audiences in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and has since kept the ticker on the screen during commercial breaks.

In July 2001, *Asia Squawk Box* was further extended to three hours and more programming hours from CNBC US and CNBC Europe were added to the line-up. This was further extended in 2002 when US programming started at 20.00 UTC+8 time uninterrupted on weeknights.


### 2005–present: Post-merger

In July 2005, Dow Jones exited its joint ventures with CNBC, putting them entirely under the ownership of NBC Universal. In March 2007, CNBC Asia announced that it would expand its presence in Australia, including establishing a new Sydney bureau (initially based out of a local GE office, with a studio under construction at the Burns Philp Building across from Sydney Exchange Square), and premiering a new hour-long program preceding *Asia Squawk Box*—*Squawk Australia*—to cover the opening of the Australian markets. The following month, CNBC launched *Worldwide Exchange*, a new international business program that would be simulcast across CNBC in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

CNBC Asia also launched two brand new shows that replaced *Market Watch* and the CNBC Europe programme *Today's Business;* *CNBC's Cash Flow*, anchored by Maura Fogarty (first hour) and Amanda Drury (second hour), was originally intensely trader and investor based. Following on from the success of *Worldwide Exchange*, another joint production, *Capital Connection* was launched. It was originally anchored by Maura Fogarty in Singapore, and Steve Sedgwick in London. Unlike *Worldwide Exchange*, which was originally produced by CNBC Europe (until production of that show was relocated to CNBC US on 4 January 2016), *Capital Connection* was produced by CNBC Asia.

On 27 September 2007, CNBC Asia announced two additional shows from Sydney, *Trading Matters*—a wrap-up of the day's market action, and *Australia This Week*. Both shows were anchored by then-newly appointed CNBC anchor Oriel Morrison, formerly of the Nine Network and Bloomberg Television. The shows debuted on 2 and 6 October 2007 respectively, as the channel officially opened its new Burns Philip Building studios. The move also saw CNBC Australia re-introduce opt-outs from the pan-Asian feed for additional airings of *Trading Matters* and *Australia This Week*.

In August 2008, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Channel Nine's finance reporter Karen Tso, would be joining the network in October 2008. She became the Sydney-based correspondent of CNBC and anchored *Squawk Australia*, thus replacing Jeffrey James. In mid-2009, CNBC Asia launched a new personal finance show as an opt-out in Australia, *The Barefoot Investor*, with Australian personal finance expert Scott Pape.

In June 2010, CNBC Asia relocated to a new studio at the Singapore Exchange. This coincided with changes to the network's lineup, including the cancellation of *Squawk Australia* and re-expansion of *Asia Squawk Box* to a three-hour format, and the new program *The Call*. On 31 March 2014, CNBC replaced *The Call* and *Cash Flow* with the early morning show *The Rundown* and a local version of *Street Signs. Asia* *Squawk Box* also re-located to a new studio in Hong Kong. In 2019, *Asia Squawk Box* returned to Singapore with a new anchor lineup.

In June 2023, CNBC Asia set up a new office in Mapletree Business City. Facilities include a master control room, a production control room for social media platforms and a small studio.

On 22 July 2024, CNBC Asia updated its on-air presentation and branding to match the new CNBC US branding that was first introduced on 11 December 2023.

### Simulcasts outside the region

In the US, all of CNBC Asia's daytime programmes are seen on CNBC World.

In Europe, during the mid to late 2000s CNBC Europe had chosen to scale back simulcasts of CNBC Asia programming overnight in favour of teleshopping and later poker games and CNBC Asia's entire morning line-up had only been seen on Monday mornings. During the rest of the week, only the second hour of *Street Signs* and *Capital Connection* were seen on CNBC Europe. However, in 2009, CNBC Europe began showing almost the entire CNBC Asia schedule throughout the week.

Since 23 April 2007, a free live and commercial-free stream of CNBC Asia has been available on CNBC.com every Monday, from 6AM to 4PM SIN time (Sundays 6PM to 4AM ET with DST). At other times, the stream can be accessed by subscribing to CNBC Plus, which costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year.

Furthermore, *Worldwide Exchange* is not shown on Fridays due to clashing with weekend shows (*Inside China*, *The Edge*) and *Managing Asia*.
