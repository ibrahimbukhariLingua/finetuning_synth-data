## History

MCB Group Ltd was incorporated on 5 August 2013 during the corporate restructure of Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB). Previously, MCB operated as both a listed company and a holding company. MCB Group was created by MCB's shareholder with the aim of separate the banking and non-banking operations and raise capital in order to position itself for future growth.

During the restructure, shareholders of MCB exchanged their MCB shares for MCB Group shares on a 1:1 ratio and the various subsidiaries previously held by Mauritius Commercial Bank were unbundled to MCB Group. Its shares were then listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius on April 5, 2014 to replace those of Mauritius Commercial Bank on the Mauritian bourse.
