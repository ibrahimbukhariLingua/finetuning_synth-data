## Career

Following Williams College, Mediratta worked for the Exportâ€“Import Bank of the United States in Washington DC before enrolling and earning an MBA at Columbia Business School.

Mediratta joined Greylock Capital upon the conclusion of Bear Stearns' merger with JP Morgan.

Mediratta chaired the creditor committee for an investor group working to restructure a large portion of the outstanding US$544 million sovereign debt of the nation of Belize. The Belize sovereign debt restructuring was noteworthy because it demonstrated how sovereign borrowers and commercial creditors can reach an amicable agreement without recourse to lawsuits. For this and for several other innovations in the deal, the Belize restructuring deal was awarded Latin Finance's 2013 Deal of the Year in the Restructuring category.

Mediratta chaired the creditor committee restructuring the $220 million debt of Panama's Trump Ocean Club Project. He also represented Greylock Capital on the $193.5 million USD sovereign debt restructuring of the nation of Grenada. The Grenada deal was considered an innovative sovereign restructuring because it offered debt relief for the nation while also allowing creditors to participate in revenue growth. He also co-chaired the October 2019 restructuring of $7bn in Barbados sovereign debt. Both the Grenada and Barbados restructurings included hurricane clauses which permit payment relief in the event of future natural disasters.

Mediratta represented Greylock Capital as part of a creditor committee formed to negotiate a restructuring of Suriname's $675 million in loans. The Suriname restructuring concluded successfully in mid-2023.
