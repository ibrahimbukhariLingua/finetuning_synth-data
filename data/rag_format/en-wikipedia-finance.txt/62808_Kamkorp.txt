## Frazer-Nash Research Limited (FNR)

Frazer-Nash Research Limited (FNR) was a British Research and Development company and the powerhouse of the Kamkorp Group of Companies. FNR develops projects from concept through to low volume production. In-house capabilities include mechanics, electronics, software, electrical, industrial and automotive engineering.
All components of FN Range-Extended Electric powertrain are designed in-house, using systems and sub-systems developed and built within the Group companies.


### Range-Extended Electric Powertrain

FNR developed a Range-Extended Electric (REE) powertrain that has been applied to a variety of vehicle platforms from city cars to low-cost mass-transit monorails.
These are electric vehicles, with an internal combustion engine (range extender) powering a matched generator as an auxiliary power unit, charging the battery pack and/or providing energy directly to the electric motors.


### Applications

The technology has been applied to a range of vehicle platforms and products by FNR, and by others developed in partnership.


### 1990s


#### Solar Baby

A zero emission people mover which was assembled in Malaysia through a joint venture company, Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik (POEM).


#### Go Kart

The electric Go Kart was Frazer-Nash Research's first electric drive product.


### 2000s


#### Sense City Car

An electric vehicle (EV) designed for city and urban use.


#### Road Train

The Road Runner had 12-motors, 4 per carriage, and could carry 45 passengers.


#### Windsor

The Windsor was designed for golf courses and large estates.


### 2010s

Frazer-Nash Research collaborated with Proton Cars of Malaysia to produce electric-powered prototypes of its Saga, Persona and Exora vehicles which subsequently participated in the RAC 2011 Brighton to London Future Car Challenge. Winners were determined by fuel efficiency and least polluting. The Proton Exora won in its category for two consecutive years.

The **Frazer-Nash Namir**, a prototype of a two-seater supercar claimed to be the "world’s fastest hybrid", was presented at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. It was stated it was capable of 187 mph with economy of 160mpg. According to Autocar magazine, "Frazer-Nash developed and supplied the four-motor powertrain, while Italdesign Giugiaro engineered and built everything else, from suspension to the carbonfibre tub." The prototype performed a demonstration run at the Goodwood Festival of Speed later in 2009.

The **Metrail Monorail** system, with its core Frazer-Nash powertrain technology, utilises the latest advances in microelectronics, lightweight composite materials and computerised traction systems. The Metrail system benefits from a self-contained on board energy system, ruling out the need for a ‘third rail’.

The **Metrocab** is a Zero emissions capable taxi trialled in London. The Metrocab, like most of the above applications has the core FN powertrain technology. The taxi is driven by two electric motors, with a 1-litre petrol engine used to recharge the battery pack, coupled with an optimised generator. Charging whilst on the go takes as little as 10 minutes, alternative charging can be achieved via any electric mains outlet.
