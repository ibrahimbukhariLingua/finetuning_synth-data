# Market! Market!



**Market! Market!** (also known as **Ayala Malls Market! Market!**) is a shopping mall complex developed by Ayala Land, the real estate subsidiary of Ayala Corporation, on a lot leased from Bases Conversion and Development Authority, a government-owned and controlled corporation. It is operated by its subsidiary, Ayala Malls. It is located at McKinley Parkway, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Philippines. Groundbreaking was conducted in August 2002 and the mall opened on September 16, 2004. The mall caters to the middle market, unlike other Ayala malls, which cater to the upper socioeconomic class.

In May 2024, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority announced that the mall will be redeveloped as a mixed-use development once the lease expires by the end of 2027.


## Location

Market! Market! is located in a 9.7-hectare (24-acre) area across Bonifacio High Street and Serendra. It is situated on the former location of the Gen. Douglas MacArthur Staff House. The mall underwent several major renovations because of market competition with SM Prime Holdings' upscale mall, SM Aura, located just across 26th Street.
