TSG Consumer Partners


# TSG Consumer Partners



**TSG Consumer Partners** is an American private equity company based in San Francisco, California. The firm was founded in 1986, and was among the first private equity firms to invest exclusively in consumer companies.

The firm also has offices in New York City Stamford, Connecticut and London.


## History

The firm was founded in 1986 as the Montgomery Consumer Fund, a partnership with an initial equity interest from Montgomery Securities. In 1988 the firm's founders, J. Gary Shansby and Charles H. Esserman, repurchased Montgomery Securities' interest and renamed the company The Shansby Group.
The firm changed its name to TSG Consumer Partners in 2005 when Esserman became CEO. Shansby left the firm in 2005 to focus on philanthropic projects as well as health issues. In March 2012, Jamie O’Hara was named President at TSG and Hadley Mullin was named Senior Managing Director in September 2014.

The firm has been noted as an anomaly in the private equity industry for its high percentage of female employees: 50 percent of employees are women, compared to 13.7% of private equity professionals in North America. In its most recent fund, TSG reported a net return of 50 percent, more than double the industry average.

In March 2019, TSG opened an office in London, the firm’s first office outside the U.S.
