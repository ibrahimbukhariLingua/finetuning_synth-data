# Jazz (mobile network operator)



**Pakistan Mobile Communications Limited (PMCL)**, doing business as **Jazz**, is a Pakistani wireless network operator headquartered in Islamabad.


## History

Jazz was founded as Mobilink in 1994 in a joint venture between Saif Group and Motorola Inc. In February 2001, Egypt based Orascom Investment Holding bought Motorola's shares in Jazz to become the majority shareholder with 69% control. Then, in June 2007, Orascom further purchased the remaining shares under Saif Group's control to become Jazz's 100% owner.

In 2010, Dutch operator VEON agreed to acquire most of the telecom assets of Orascom, including Jazz, in a $6.5 billion deal, creating the world's fifth-largest mobile network operator by subscriber base. In November 2015, VEON announced the acquisition of Warid Pakistan, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Group. Completed in July 2016 after due approvals, the first-ever local telecom company acquisition created a combined subscriber base of 50 million.

Following the merger of Mobilink and Warid Pakistan, Mobilink was officially rebranded to Jazz in 2017.

VEON will buy the remaining 15% shares in Jazz from Abu Dhabi Group for 100pc ownership. In March 2021, VEON completed the acquisition of 15 percent shares held by Abu Dhabi Group for US$273 million.
