## Funding

In Series A funding, Plum District received $8.5M in funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and General Catalyst Partners, two top U.S. venture firms. Previous financing, also Series A, of $2.1M came from a collection of angel investors.

In December 2011, the company raised a combined $20 million from General Catalyst Partners, Kleiner Perkins, Comcast, and Duke University in Series C funding.


## Business model

Plum District introduces a distinct deal of the day in each of the local markets it serves. The deal is mailed or delivered electronically to local and national Plum District subscribers. Like all Deal Of The Day sites, Plum District's revenue is generated from affiliate marketing, advertising placements, and joint ventures with the merchants with whom they work.


## Acquisitions

The company acquired merchant loyalty business Chatterfly and New York based daily deal business DoodleDeals, in December 2011.

In 2013, Plum District acquired AngelPad-backed Spotivate, the first acquisition by then-new president Susan Kim.
