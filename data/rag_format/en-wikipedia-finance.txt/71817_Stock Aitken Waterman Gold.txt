# Stock Aitken Waterman Gold



***Stock Aitken Waterman Gold*** is a compilation album released in 2005 by Sony BMG, PWL Records and EBUL.


## Overview

*Gold* is a triple CD collection that brings together the biggest hits of British producers Stock Aitken Waterman. All of the tracks were big hits when released internationally between 1984 and 1991 - the production trio's most successful period.

As a complete overview of Stock Aitken Waterman's most popular work, *Gold* contains nine UK number one hits by several different artists, two of which were recorded to raise money for charity. The producer's success on the US chart is represented by three Billboard Hot 100 number one's: Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up", "Together Forever" and Bananarama's "Venus". The girl-group Boy Krazy also feature, although not successful in the UK, they achieved notable success with "That's What Love Can Do" which made the Billboard Hot 100 Top 20 and was the last Stock Aitken Waterman Production before Matt Aitken departed in 1991. A Japanese-only release, "Turn It into Love" by Kylie Minogue rounds off the collection; this song was not issued as an A side in the UK, it was actually covered and released by PWL stablemate Hazell Dean instead, and whose bigger UK hits are included on this collection. A bonus track can be found at the end of the second disc: Mandy Smith's original recording of Kylie Minogue's second international release "Got to Be Certain", unearthed from the PWL vaults. With an identical backing track, the only difference between the recordings are Mandy's vocals instead of Kylie's.

*Stock Aitken Waterman Gold* contains the standard radio edits of the track listing, with extended mixes, rarities and a megamix saved entirely for the third disc.
