Brazilian currency


# Brazilian currency



There have been nine different units of **Brazilian currency** in sequence over the country's history: the Portuguese and first Brazilian real (plural **réis**); 3 different types of cruzeiros; the cruzado; the novo cruzado; the cruzeiro real, and since 1994, the second incarnation of the Brazilian real (plural **reais**), with the symbol **R$** and the ISO code **BRL**.


## Historical currencies

While Portuguese settlers used Réis coins from Portugal, Dutch settlers occupying Northeastern Brazil used guilders. In 1645, the colony faced an economic crisis and, with a lack of financial support from the mainland and the need to pay for trops fighting Portuguese settlers, the local Dutch administration struck the first ever coins in Brazilian land, repurpusing gold coming from the Dutch Guinea. A few years later, in 1654, in an increasingly worse situation, coins were again minted to pay off debt, but this time with silver from the administrators' own coffers.

Historical currencies of Brazil
| Introduction | Withdrawal | Duration | Name | Symbol | ISO | Conversion | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | — | Portuguese Real | Rs | N/A | In the Portuguese Empire and in Brazil until 1942, the symbol "Rs" or "Rs." was prefixed to the amount, and additionally the double-stroke dollar sign "" (*cifrão*) was used as a thousands separator in amounts greater than 999 réis. If the last three digits were "000", they would sometimes be omitted. If the *cifrão* was present, the "Rs." was commonly omitted too. Thus "Rs 123500" meant "123 500 réis", and "123" meant "123 000" réis. |
| 12 October 1822 | 120y 20d | Real (old, pl. *réis*) | Rs | = 1 Portuguese real | There isn't an official or exact date for the transition from *Portuguese* réis to *Brazilian* réis. Brazil became independent on 12 October 1822, and the first coin minted in the new country, known as the coronation piece, was minted in that same year (1822), exclusively tn Brazil, to commemorate Pedro I's coronation. While the Portuguese real may have continued to be legal tender in Brazil, the Brazilian real became a separate currency at that point. |
| 1 November 1942 | 24y 3m 12d | Cruzeiro (first) | Cr$ | = 1,000 réis |
| 13 February 1967 | 30 June 1972 | 3y 3m 2d | Cruzeiro novo | NCr$ | = 1,000 cruzeiros |
| 15 May 1970 | 15y 9m 12d | Cruzeiro (second) | Cr$ | BRB | = 1 cruzeiro novo | Change of name of the cruzeiro novo. Not a new currency. |
| 27 February 1986 | 2y 10m 19d | Cruzado | Cz$ | BRC | = 1,000 cruzeiros |
| 15 January 1989 | 1y 2m 1d | Cruzado novo | NCz$ | BRN | = 1,000 cruzados |
| 16 March 1990 | 3y 4m 15d | Cruzeiro (third) | Cr$ | BRE | = 1 cruzado novo |
| 1 August 1993 | 11m | Cruzeiro real | CR$ | BRR | = 1,000 cruzeiros |
| 1 July 1994 | (still in use) | 30y 7m 9d | Real (new, pl. *reais*) | R$ | BRL | = 2,750 cruzeiros reais |

Note that the dates of various currencies overlap. For example, the cruzeiro novo was still legal tender for 2 years after the second cruzeiro was introduced.

Not considering inflation, one modern Brazilian real is equivalent to 2,750,000,000,000,000,000 times the old real, that is, 2.75×10¹⁸ (2.75 quintillion) réis.

Before leaving Brazil in 1821, the Portuguese royal court withdrew all the bullion currency it could from banks in exchange for what would become worthless bond notes;


## Banknotes

| Cruzeiro (3rd) |
| Cruzeiro real |
| Real (new) |

No single face value has been present in all historical Brazilian banknotes. For example, a face value of 100 is missing from the old real (as its lowest denomination of banknote is 500 Rs) and from the provisional cruzeiro novo (as its only banknotes were overstamps of the first cruzeiro, and the highest denomination was NCr$10). It is, however, present in all the other currencies.


## Coins

The following tables indicate what coins were present in each of the currencies of Brazil, with the exception of réis:

No single face value has been present in all historical Brazilian coins. For example, a face value of 1 is missing from the cruzeiro novo (as its highest denomination of coin is NCr$0.50 because it's a transitory monetary standard between the cruzeiro issued between 1942 and 1967 and the cruzeiro issued after 1970) and from the old real and the cruzeiro real (as their lowest denomination of coin is 5 Rs and CR$5, respectively). It is, however, present in all the other currencies:
