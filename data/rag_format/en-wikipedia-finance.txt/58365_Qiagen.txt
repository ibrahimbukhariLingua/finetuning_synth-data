### 2020 Thermo Fisher Acquisition Target

On March 3, 2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced plans for the acquisition of QIAGEN at €39 per share in cash, which valued the transaction at $11.5 billion at the time. The day after an open letter by hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management, one of QIAGEN's largest shareholders, to reject the bid as undervalued, Thermo Fisher raised their tender by 10% to €43 per share, an advance of $1B in value.

The acquisition offer was terminated on August 13, 2020, having only reached the threshold of 47% shareholder approval, below the minimum 66.6% required as per the agreement. Because of the lapsed offer, QIAGEN was required to reimburse $95 million to Thermo Fisher in expenses.

Resulting from the failed takeover bid, QIAGEN announced it would buy the outstanding 80.1% of shares in NeuMoDx Molecular Inc., which it did not already own, for about $234 million.
