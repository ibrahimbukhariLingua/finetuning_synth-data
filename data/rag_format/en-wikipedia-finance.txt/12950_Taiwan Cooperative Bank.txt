# Taiwan Cooperative Bank



The **Taiwan Cooperative Bank** (**TCB**; Chinese: 合作金庫銀行; pinyin: *Hézuò Jīnkù Yínháng*; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: *Ha̍p-chok Kim-khò͘ Gîn-hâng*) is a publicly listed bank headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. Originally established in 1923 during Japanese rule in Taiwan, TCB was reorganized in 1946 and has grown significantly since. Today, it is one of the largest banks in Taiwan and has the most branches (301) among Taiwanese banks. Taiwan Cooperative Bank is one of Taiwan's six domestic systemically important banks.


## History

The bank was first established in 1923 as an alliance of about 290 credit unions in Taiwan.

In 2009, BNP Paribas announced a joint venture with TCB to sell insurance products in Taiwan. The following year, BNP announced another joint venture with TCB to set up an asset management operation in Taiwan.

Taiwan Cooperative Bank was listed by the Financial Supervisory Commission as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB), along with Taipei Fubon Bank, CTBC Bank, Cathay United Bank, Mega International Commercial Bank, and First Commercial Bank (第一銀行).

In 2022, the bank opened a Czech office in Prague to tap business opportunities in Central Europe. The move came in the midst of warming relations between Taiwan and the Czech Republic.

On 2 July 2023, CEO Lin Chien-hao (林謙浩) passed away, and operations were announced to be continuing under the interim leadership of bank president Lin Mao-yin (林衍茂) and general manager Chen Mei-tsu (陳美足).
