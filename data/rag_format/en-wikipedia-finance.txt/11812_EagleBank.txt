## History

The bank was founded in 1998 under the holding company Eagle Bancorp Inc, which was established in 1997 by Ronald D. Paul, a longtime banking executive. Eagle Bancorp, Inc., was incorporated as a bank holding company in Maryland on October 28, 1997. On June 9, 1998, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. On July 20, 1998, EagleBank opened its first office in Rockville, Maryland. In the coming years, the bank opened several branches in the Washington, D.C. area.

In December 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury purchased $38.2 million of assets from EagleBank as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In 2010, EagleBank received $71.9 million funding so it could lend more to small businesses as part of the United States Department of Treasury's Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. The funds were repaid to the US Treasury by EagleBank in 2015 after a stock sale.

In 2013, EagleBank teamed with Graystone Consulting to provide wealth management services.

In March 2019, EagleBank's founder and CEO, Ron Paul, announced his retirement. Susan G. Riel was appointed CEO and President and Norm Pozez was appointed chairman.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank was a lender in the Paycheck Protection Program.

## Controversies

In 2011, the company was reported to be the source of legislation introduced by Council of the District of Columbia member Jack Evans that would require the city's funds to be held at local banks.

On July 18, 2019, the company's stock price fell as much as 25% after it disclosed that it had spent $2.7 million on legal fees related to the relationship between a former director and Council of the District of Columbia member Jack Evans. It had previously been disclosed that Ron Paul had received a subpoena related to his relationship with Evans.

In 2022, the company was ordered to pay $22.9M to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Reserve to settle claims the bank's former CEO had engaged in insider lending. Former EagleBank CEO Ron Paul has been banned permanently from working in the banking industry and he was fined about $521,000. The 2022 settlement ended a 3-year probe by regulators into alleged third-party lending and improper disclosures by EagleBank.
