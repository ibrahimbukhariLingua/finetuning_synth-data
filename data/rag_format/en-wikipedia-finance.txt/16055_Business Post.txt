Business Post


# Business Post



The ***Business Post*** (formerly ***The Sunday Business Post***) is a Sunday newspaper distributed nationally in Ireland and an online publication. It is focused mainly on business and financial issues in Ireland.


## Founding to Irish financial crisis

*The Sunday Business Post* was co-founded by four people: the economist and editor Damien Kiberd, Aileen O'Toole (former editor of *Business & Finance*), Frank Fitzgibbon (editor of *The Sunday Times* Ireland) and James Morrissey (spokesperson for Denis O'Brien).

The *SBP* was previously owned by Thomas Crosbie Holdings (TCH). It was then owned by Key Capital, Paul Cooke and staff members (6% equity for staff). It was then owned by Sunrise Media, the shareholders of which include Key Capital. It is now owned by Kilcullen Capital Partners.

The paper's first edition appeared on 26 November 1989. While TCH's other major newspaper titles, the *Irish Examiner* and *Evening Echo*, are based in Cork, the *Post* is published in Dublin. The paper describes itself as "Ireland's Political, Economic and Financial Newspaper". It is a general newspaper with a strong emphasis on commerce, politics and financial markets. The newspaper does not have a sports section or letters section. Three supplements are published weekly with the newspaper: *Post Plus*, *The Magazine*, an entertainment and features magazine; and a property supplement. A once-monthly *Computers in Business* magazine is also included.

Ted Harding succeeded Kiberd as editor of the paper in 2001 and edited the paper for three years, resigning in October 2004.

## Examinership (2013)

An interim examiner was formally appointed to Post Publications Ltd, publisher of *The Sunday Business Post* newspaper, on 15 March 2013. The High Court was told that there might be a voluntary redundancy scheme at the newspaper in late 2013 which would target 25 staff positions. This could coincide with pay cuts of 7% for employees and further possible changes as part of a financial restructuring plan for the company, the court was told.

It was reported on 28 April 2013 that two companies were interested in acquiring the *SBP* from the examiner. Landmark Media Investments, which acquired some of the assets of Thomas Crosbie Holdings, was no longer interested in the title. It was also reported that the *SBP* required an investment of at least €2m to acquire the paper and restructure it. Any new bidder would have to fund the cost of laying off some staff.

On 8 May 2013, it was reported that *The Sunday Business Post* had started staff redundancies. Up to ten staff were to leave the company by 10 May 2013. Staff were also told about a third pay cut. Post Publications was also looking to reduce the amount paid to its landlord by €1 million per year.

It was reported on 12 May 2013 that bidders for *The Sunday Business Post* included Michael Brophy, a former chief executive of Independent News & Media (Northern Ireland).

On 15 May 2013, Post Publications was back in court. It reported that the examiner had failed to find a buyer in the first 70 days of the examinership. The examiner was given a final 30-day extension to find a buyer. If a buyer did not materialise, the examiner had to advise the court immediately. Annual revenue fell from €15.3 million to €7.3 million in the five years to 2013. Circulation revenue fell from €4.9 million to €3.6 million in the last 5 years to 2013. The newspaper had 76 full-time employees and 123 freelance contributors and made a loss of €1.2 million in the year to 2013.
