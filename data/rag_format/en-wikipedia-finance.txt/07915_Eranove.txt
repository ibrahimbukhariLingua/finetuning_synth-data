# Eranove



**Eranove** is a French company active in the management of public services and in the production of electricity and drinking water in Africa. The company was formerly known as **Finagestion**.

Eranove has been present in Côte d'Ivoire for several decades, in Senegal (SDE) since 1996, in the Democratic Republic of Congo since 2012 (service contract with Regideso), and in Benin since 2021(through its subsidiary, Omilayé in the water sector in Benin). The company has also been developing projects in Mali since 2015 (Kénié Énergie Renouvelable), Gabon (Louetsi Hydro, Asokh Energy, Orélo), Madagascar (Sahofika), and Togo (Kékéli Efficient Power). It generated revenues of €576 million in 2017.

Eranove operates at a capacity of over 1,250 MW, employs over 8,700 people, and serves 1.9 million customers for electricity, 1.8 million for water, and 470,000 for sanitation. The majority shareholder of the Eranove Group is ECP Finagestion FII S.a.r.l., affiliated with Emerging Capital Partners, a private equity firm.


## History

The board of directors decided to rename Finagestion "Eranove" in July 2014 following a consultative process within the group's subsidiaries.

Prior to renaming, between 2005 and 2006, the Bouygues Group sold its public services subsidiary, Saur, while retaining its African and Italian assets. The African assets were housed in Finagestion, a holding company 100% owned by the Bouygues Group.

Between July 2008 and October 2009, ECP FII Finagestion S.a.r.l., an affiliate of Emerging Capital Partners (ECP), gradually acquired a 60% stake in this entity from Bouygues. ECP FII Finagestion S.a.r.l. currently owns 53.3% of the Eranove group. ECP gradually transformed Eranove (at the time Finagestion) into a pan-African industrial platform.

Since 1960, the Eranove Group has been present in Côte d'Ivoire (Société de Distribution d'Eau de Côte d'Ivoire; Compagnie Ivoirienne d'électricité; Compagnie Ivoirienne de Production d'électricité; Awale). It began operations in Senegal in 1996 (Sénégalaise des Eaux). Since 2013, it has been active in the Democratic Republic of Congo through a service contract with the Régidéso. The group is also developing other projects across Africa, notably in Mali (Kenié Renewable Energy), Gabon (Louetsi Hydro, Asokh Energy, Orélo), Madagascar (Sahofika), Côte d'Ivoire (Atinkou and Cavally), and Togo (Kékéli Efficient Power).

In the summer of 2015, the 18.6% still held by Bouygues were sold to French insurance company AXA.

## Operations (through affiliates and service contracts)


### CIPREL (Compagnie ivoirienne de production d'électricité)

A power generation company operating in Côte d'Ivoire since 1994, CIPREL (Compagnie Ivoirienne de Production d'électricité [fr]) has a thermal power plant consisting of seven combustion turbines, which use natural gas extracted off the Ivorian coast as their main fuel, as well as a steam turbine.

CIPREL operates a concession contract, running until 2035, with the State of Côte d'Ivoire. It is 83.3% owned by Eranove.

The entire CIPREL perimeter is HSE certified: ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001. CIPREL has reached the confirmed stage of the ISO 26 000 standard for its commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) throughout its scope.


#### History

The company began its activities in March 1995 with CIPREL I (100 MW). The second 111 MW unit (CIPREL II) was commissioned in June 1997. Then in December 2009, 111 MW (CIPREL III) were commissioned, bringing the total production capacity to 321 MW.

In December 2011, CIPREL was entrusted with a new extension to support Côte d'Ivoire's economic recovery, CIPREL IV.

CIPREL IV represents a total investment (including financing) of CFAF 222.9 billion (€339.8 million) for an additional 222 MW using combined cycle technology. This fourth unit consists of a new 111 MW combustion turbine commissioned on 1 January 2014 and a 111 MW steam turbine. The steam turbine adds 111 MW of production capacity without additional natural gas consumption and thus avoids the release into the atmosphere of 500,000 tons of CO₂ per year, while optimizing the cost of electricity production through improved thermal efficiency.

Auxiliary works were completed at the end of 2015, making CIPREL IV's the largest gas-fired power plant in Côte d'Ivoire with a total production capacity of 556 MW and an estimated total annual production of 3,810 GWh.


### CIE (Compagnie ivoirienne d’électricité)

CIE (Compagnie Ivoirienne d'Électricité) is a private operator linked to the State of Côte d'Ivoire by a concession agreement since 1990 to operate production, transmission and distribution facilities, and market, import and export on behalf of the Ivorian State of electricity throughout the national territory and in the wider region.
