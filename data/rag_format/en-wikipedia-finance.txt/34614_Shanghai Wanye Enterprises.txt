# Shanghai Wanye Enterprises



**Shanghai Wanye Enterprises** (SWEC; Chinese: 万业企业; pinyin: *Wànyè Qǐyè*) is a publicly listed Chinese company that engages in the development and sale of semiconductor equipment. It also engages in the sale of real estate properties.

Its three semiconductor subsidiaries are Kingstone Semiconductor, Compart Systems and Joysingtech.


## Background

The company was established in October 1991 as Shanghai Zhong Cheng Industrial, a real estate company.

On 7 April 1993, the company went public by listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

In July 1997, COSCO acquired a controlling stake in Shanghai Zhong Cheng Industrial. The company was subsequently renamed to COSCO Development.

In 2006, Salim Group acquired a controlling stake in COSCO Development and the company was renamed to Shanghai Wanye Enterprises.

Due to the sluggish real estate market, Salim Group looked to transform SWEC into a semiconductor company by acquiring overseas firms although the initial plan did not materialize. In November 2015, the Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology Investment Company became the largest shareholder of SWEC after a share transfer agreement with Salim Group. Under the new ownership structure, SWEC continued its transformation into a semiconductor company.

In April 2017, SWEC took the lead in launching the Shanghai Semiconductor Equipment and Material Investment Fund where it became it became the joint largest shareholder along with the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund.

In 2022, it was reported that SWEC's main revenue and profit still came from the sale of existing real estate holdings and that the company still had not transformed fully into a semiconductor company.
