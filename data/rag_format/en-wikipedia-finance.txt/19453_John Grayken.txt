## Career

Grayken first worked at Morgan Stanley, before joining the RMB Realty Group, the real estate investment firm of Texas billionaire Robert Bass.

Grayken served as the managing general partner of the Brazos Fund, a vulture fund founded by Bass in 1995. The fund aimed to buy mortgage-related assets from the banking industry, including from the Resolution Trust Corporation. Bass contributed US$30 million to Brazos Fund’s $250 million capital base, which enabled Grayken to pursue his first cross-border deal in Canada. In 1996, Brazos bought a pool of non-performing assets from the National Bank of Canada.

Grayken founded Lone Star, the successor to the Brazos Fund, in 1995.

In 1999, Grayken became an Irish citizen, "for tax purposes", renouncing his American citizenship.

As of 2015, they owned Pyrford Court, Surrey, which features prominently in the 1976 movie, *The Omen*.

As of 2017, they live in a $70 million home in Chelsea, London, purchased through a company in Bermuda.

In 2022, he was accused by the police in Delhi of criminal breach of trust, cheating, and criminal conspiracy. It is alleged that he personally became the beneficial owner of RattanIndia Finance, when he had told other shareholders that Lone Star Funds would do so. The police further claimed that the Reserve Bank of India had approved the ownership of RattanIndia Finance by Lone Star Funds, but had not approved Grayden's direct ownership as required under Indian law.
