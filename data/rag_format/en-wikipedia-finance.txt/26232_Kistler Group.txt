# Kistler Group



**Kistler Group** (legal name: Kistler Instrumente AG), headquartered in Winterthur, is an internationally active Swiss group of companies specializing in the field of measurement technology. The Kistler Group has around 2,200 employees at more than 60 locations worldwide. In 2023, it generated sales of 465 million Swiss francs. Approximately 9% of revenue flows back into research and technology every year.


## History

The company was founded by Walter P. Kistler and Hans Conrad Sonderegger in 1959 as the Kistler Instrument Corporation, but the enterprise started in 1950 when Walter Kistler patented a charge amplifier he developed. Hans Conrad Sonderegger is the father of the current (2010) CEO. In 1959 the company became active on the stock market. Since 1961 the company started the in-house production of charge amplifiers and the development of other sensors. The company made several major innovations, some of which would be put to use in the Apollo manned spaceflights,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and became a world leader in the development of quartz sensors. Walter Kistler left the company in 1970 and moved to Seattle, Washington.


## Field of activity

Kistler develops, manufactures and distributes sensors for measuring pressure, force, torque and acceleration, as well as electronics and software. Kistler specializes in piezoelectric and piezoresistive measurement technology.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### High-temperature and ballistic pressure sensors

Kistler measuring systems allow measuring thermoacoustics phenomena in harsh environments with extreme temperatures up to 700 °C. Applications include monitoring of gas turbines and other turbomachinery, R&D of continuous detonation engines, monitoring, and control of pressure oscillations in pipes and acoustic thermometry. Kistler’s durable piezoelectric sensors based on proprietary PiezoStar® KI100 crystal material have been developed specifically for temperatures up to 700 °C. KI100 crystals have no pyroelectric effect.

The piezoelectric sensors (named "channel sensors") from Kistler are also used by the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (C.I.P.) for proof testing firearms ammunition. These sensors require drilling of the cartridge case before firing the proofing cartridge in a specially made test barrel.
For NATO EPVAT testing of military firearms ammunition NATO design EPVAT test barrels with Kistler 6215 and HPI GP6 transducers can be used.
For testing shotshell ammunition Kistler produces one type of piezoelectric sensor (called "tangential sensor")'
