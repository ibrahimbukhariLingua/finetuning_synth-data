Copper in Africa


# Copper in Africa



Copper is one of the world's most important industrial minerals, and Africa is an important world producer. While output is traditionally dominated by Zambia, South Africa and Katanga Province in the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, many African nations contribute to copper production, and many African nations have undeveloped ore resources.

Cobalt, another important industrial metal, is often mined in conjunction with copper.
