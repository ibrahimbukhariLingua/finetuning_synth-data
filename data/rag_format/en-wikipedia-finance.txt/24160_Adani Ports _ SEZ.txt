### Myanmar activities

On 30 March 2021, the group of activists Justice for Myanmar released a press statement regarding the international activities of Adani Ports & SEZ. They accused Adani of building a container port in Yangon, Myanmar on land leased from the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), a military-run business conglomerate, which was directly contributing financially to the Myanmar Junta after the 2021 coup. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation corroborated the reporting of Justice for Myanmar including video evidence. MEC and its subsidiaries are sanctioned by US, UK and EU.

Adani denied the fraud allegations as 'unfounded and ill intentioned'.


### Auditor's concerns

In May 2023, the company's auditor, Deloitte, issued a qualified opinion on the company's financial reports, as it could not verify whether certain transactions were with unrelated or related parties. In August 2023, Deloitte resigned as the company's auditor citing its inability to scrutinize the company's transactions with other group companies of which it was not a statutory auditor.
