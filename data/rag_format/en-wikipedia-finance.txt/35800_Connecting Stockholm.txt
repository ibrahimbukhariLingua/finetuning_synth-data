## History

Connecting Stockholm was founded in 2022. In January 2024 in was awarded the 11-year contract to operate the Stockholm Metro network. It will takeover from MTR. After unsuccessful bidder Keolis launched a legal challenge, in October 2024 Region Stockholm awarded Connecting Stockholm a provisional two-year contract pending completion of the legal process that would commence on 2 November 2025 on similar terms to the original deal.

On November 21, 2024, Region Stockholm finalised a permanent contract with Connecting Stockholm to run the Stockholm Metro. This decision followed the Court of Appeal's refusal to allow an appeal from Keolis on November 5, 2024. The contract is worth about 40 billion SEK (â‚¬3.5 billion), described as the largest non-military public procurement in the world.

Connecting Stockholm will operate the Stockholm Metro for 11 years, starting on November 2, 2025. It will be responsible for tasks including operating the metro service, planning routes, managing staff, cleaning stations, providing passenger information, and maintaining the trains and depots. The agreement also includes incentives for good performance in areas like punctuality and customer satisfaction.
