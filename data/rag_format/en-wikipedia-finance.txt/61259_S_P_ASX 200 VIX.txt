S&P/ASX 200 VIX


# S&P/ASX 200 VIX



The **S&P/ASX200 VIX** (**A-VIX**), is a financial market product, which is traded based on the implied volatility in the underlying Australian equity index.


## Uses and interpretation

The A-VIX is a market instrument pricing investor sentiment and market expectations. A relatively high A-VIX value implies that the market expects significant changes in the S&P/ASX 200 over the next 30 days, while a relatively low A-VIX value implies that the market expects minimal change. The ASX chart below illustrates this relationship.

Similarly, when the A-VIX is at relatively high levels, investor sentiment prices in high uncertainty.

Conversely, when the A-VIX is at relatively low levels, it implies low uncertainty.

Instruments such as the A-VIX are often perceived to show characteristics of mean reversion by oscillating around a long-term average (or mean). In other words, a move away from the long-term average towards high or low extremes is usually followed by a move back towards the long-term average.

The implication is that high levels of volatility may be followed by a return to more normal volatility levels, and low levels of volatility may be precursors to an increase in volatility.

The A-VIX is reported as an annualized standard deviation percentage that can be converted to a shorter time period. For instance, an A-VIX value of 20% can be converted to a monthly figure, remembering that volatility scales at the square root of time, the formula is:

20% x âˆš1/12 = 5.77%

In the above example, index options over the S&P/ASX 200 are incorporating the potential for a one standard deviation return over the next month of +/- 5.77%.

## Comparison with other tools used for managing volatility

* Easier and typically cheaper - S&P/ASX 200 VIX Futures may offer a cheaper and easier to use tool than options when creating and managing an exposure to volatility in the Australian equity market. Being exchange traded and centrally cleared, S&P/ASX 200 VIX Futures also offer operational and risk management advantages beyond over-the-counter products such as variance swaps.
* Pure volatility - Other tools which are used for gaining exposure or hedging against volatility in the Australian equity market also create exposures to additional and unwanted risk. The hedging of these additional risks adds to the cost and complication of managing your exposures.

For example:

* Using a derivative on an offshore-based VIX index may create a higher tracking error (particularly during periods of high volatility), create a currency exposure and require you to trade in the home market time zone to access the best liquidity.
* Use of an option strategy may introduce additional sensitivities such as directional risk, or require adjustments to the strategy and so incur additional transaction costs.
* OTC products, such as variance swaps, can introduce counterparty risk and their liquidity in the Australian time zone can be patchy.
