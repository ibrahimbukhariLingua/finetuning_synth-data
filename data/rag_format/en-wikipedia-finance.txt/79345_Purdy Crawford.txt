## Targeting young non-smokers

In 2000, the *Globe and Mail* obtained documents showing that, in spite of tobacco industry denials that it focused on selling its products to young non-smokers, Crawford supported Imperial Tobacco's efforts to target them in its marketing campaigns. "Imperial Tobacco Ltd. has always focused its efforts on new smokers, believing that early impressions tend to stay with them throughout their lives," Crawford privately told executives of Imperial's parent company in 1989. He added that his company "clearly dominates the young adult market today, and stands to prosper as these smokers age, and as it maintains its highly favourable youthful preference."


## Death

He died on August 12, 2014, at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. Services were held at Metropolitan United Church in Toronto, and at Peniel United in Five Islands, in August and October respectively.
