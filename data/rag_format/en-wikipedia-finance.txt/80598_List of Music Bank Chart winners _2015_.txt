# List of Music Bank Chart winners (2015)



The *Music Bank* Chart is a record chart established in 1998 on the South Korean KBS television music program Music Bank. Every week during its live broadcast, the show gives an award for the best-performing single on the South Korean chart. The chart includes digital performance on domestic online music services (65%), album sales (5%), number of times the single was broadcast on KBS TV (20%), and viewers' choice (10%) in its ranking methodology. The score for domestic online music services is calculated using data from Melon, Bugs, Genie Music, and Soribada. Actor Park Seo-joon and Sistar member Yoon Bo-ra had hosted the show since October 2013 and continued to do so until April 24, 2015. Starting May 1, actor and singer Park Bo-gum and Red Velvet member Irene became the hosts of the show. BTS member V and B.A.P member Kim Him-chan appeared as special hosts along with Park Bo-gum on the December 4 broadcast in lieu of Irene.
