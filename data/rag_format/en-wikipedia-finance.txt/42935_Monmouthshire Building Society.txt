## History

The society was formed in January 1869 as the Monmouthshire and South Wales Permanent Investment Benefit Building Society. Five of the original board of directors went on to become mayors of Newport.

In 1890, the operations were moved to new offices in Friars Chambers, Dock Street, where the Head Office stands today, although the development of John Frost Square means the offices have been rebuilt. The Society's name has been shortened over the years; the most recent name change coincided with the Society's centenary in 1969.
