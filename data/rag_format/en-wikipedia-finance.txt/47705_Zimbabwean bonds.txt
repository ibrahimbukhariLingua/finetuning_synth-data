Zimbabwean bonds


# Zimbabwean bonds



**Zimbabwean Bonds** were a form of legal tender near money released by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe which attempts to resolve Zimbabwe's lack of currency. Bonds and were pegged against the U.S. dollar at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate and backed by the country's reserve. Since abandoning the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009 after it went into hyperinflation the country began using a number of foreign currencies including the U.S. dollar, South African rand, British pound and Chinese yuan as a means of exchange. The inability to print these currencies led to a shortage of money with banks issuing limits on withdrawals.


## Coins

On 18 December 2014 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe began issuing so-called 'bond coins' which were supported by a US$50 million facility extended to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe by Afreximbank (the African Exportâ€“Import Bank). Pegged against the U.S. dollar coins were denominated at 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents and later followed by a 50-cent coin in 2015. A bi-metallic one-dollar bond coin was released on 28 November 2016. A bi-metallic two-dollar bond coin was released into circulation in 2018.

in 2024 the Zimbabwe gold was introduced and replaced the Zimbabwe dollar.
