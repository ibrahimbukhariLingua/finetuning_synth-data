## Career

Hefner started working for Playboy Enterprises, Inc. when he was in college. In early 2016, Hefner, who was a board observer at the time, left the company due to disagreements with then CEO Scott Flanders about the direction the company was taking. He then began editing, writing and publishing op-eds, which centered on politics, culture and philosophy.

In 2016, Hefner launched the media startup company Hop (Hefner Operations & Productions), focused on content and social events for millennials. He returned to Playboy and was named chief creative officer of the company in July 2016 when Hugh Hefner stepped down from that post. In February 2017, Hefner announced nude images would return to the magazine, stating that the problem had been the presentation of nude images rather than the nudity itself. He also oversaw the decision to feature Playboy's first transgender playmate in the centerfold for its November issue.

Playboy's earnings for 2017 increased by more than 39 percent year-over-year following Hefner's return to the company.

In April 2019, Playboy Enterprises CEO Ben Kohn confirmed Hefner would exit his senior role at Playboy to launch a media brand, the Hefner Media Corporation, and a digital content platform called *HefPost*. Later, through an Instagram account after having left Playboy, in July 2019 Hefner stated his new digital content platform would be called instead *StagDaily*.

In December 2019, Hefner halted plans to start a media company and digital content platform, and enlisted in the United States Air Force.

He was deployed stateside to New Jersey's Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst for Operation Allies Welcome, which supported resettlement of approximately 130,000 refugees airlifted from Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.

In October 2024, Hefner offered $100 million through his firm Hefner Capital to purchase Playboy with the parent company PLBY Group’s shares having declined roughly 99% from a high of $57.70 in May 2021. PLBY, which had reported a decline in revenue, said in August that it is re-launching *Playboy* magazine as an annual edition, as of February 2025.
