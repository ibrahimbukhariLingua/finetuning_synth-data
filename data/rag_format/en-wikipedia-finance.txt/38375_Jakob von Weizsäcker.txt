## Career


### Early career

Weizsäcker started work as a research fellow with Jean-Charles Hourcade at CIRED in Paris and then with Hans-Werner Sinn at the Center for Economic Studies in Munich. After stints at a venture capital firm and as a visiting scholar at the MIT Department of economics, he joined the German Ministry for Economic Affairs in 2001 as private secretary to Parliamentary State Secretary Siegmar Mosdorf. From 2002 to 2005, he worked for the World Bank in Washington, D.C., and Dushanbe. In 2005-2010 he was a resident fellow of the think-tank Bruegel in Brussels. With his work on migration policy, he coined the term Blue Card for a European scheme to attract high-skilled immigrants.

From 2010 to 2014, Weizsäcker headed a department at the State Ministry of Economic Affairs in Thuringia. In 2013, he and Maximilian Steinbeis founded the *Glienicker Gruppe*, a group of pro-European lawyers, economists and political scientists, together with Henrik Enderlein, Marcel Fratzscher, Clemens Fuest and others.


### Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2019

In the 2014 European elections, Weizsäcker was elected to the European Parliament where he was a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

Weizsäcker's legislative files included bank structural reform and too-big-to-fail rules for clearing houses (CCPs). In 2016, the parliament voted in favour of his non-binding report on the regulation of virtual currencies such as bitcoin and blockchain.

In addition to his committee assignments, Weizsäcker also was a member of the parliament’s delegation for relations with India.


### Career in government

In January 2019, Weizsäcker resigned from the European Parliament upon his nomination as chief economist for the German Ministry of Finance.

When Jens Weidmann announced his resignation as president of the Deutsche Bundesbank in 2021, the *Financial Times* mentioned Weizsäcker as one of the leading contenders to succeed him.

He served briefly as head of the Secretariat of the G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force on Pandemic Preparedness in 2022.

On 25 April 2022 Weizsäcker became State Minister of Finance in the government of Minister-President of the Saarland Anke Rehlinger. As one of his state's representatives at the Bundesrat, he has since been serving on the Finance Committee and on the Committee on Cultural Affairs.
