In February 2018, the company acquired a further 22 care homes, including 11 in Scotland, with 2,700 beds, from BUPA for an undisclosed amount. Advinia took over the employment of the 3,700 staff at the Bupa homes.

As reported in 2019, the firm was under investigation by regulators, the latter stating Advenia Group was "failing to co-operate with a regulatory inquiry into its finances." *The Guardian* wrote that the Care Quality Commission (CQC) "has become seriously concerned in recent months about the group’s cash flow and financial management, as well as its refusal to submit" to an independent audit of its finances. "Advinia’s submissions to the CQC...showed the company was not generating enough cash to meet capital and interest repayments in the next few months". Failure to comply may result in the revocation of its license.
