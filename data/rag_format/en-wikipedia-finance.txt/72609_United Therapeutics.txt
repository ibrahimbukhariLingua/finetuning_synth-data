# United Therapeutics



**United Therapeutics Corporation** is an American publicly traded biotechnology company and public benefit corporation listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol UTHR. It develops novel, life-extending technologies for patients in the areas of lung disease and organ manufacturing. United Therapeutics is co-headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, with additional facilities in Magog and Bromont, Quebec; Melbourne and Jacksonville, Florida; Blacksburg, Virginia; and Manchester, New Hampshire.


## History

United Therapeutics was founded in 1996 by Martine Rothblatt, an American lawyer, author, and entrepreneur, who created Sirius XM. In 1994, Rothblatt's young daughter was diagnosed with a fatal orphan disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Rothblatt sold her telecom stock and started the PPH Cure Foundation to fund PAH research.

In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved United Therapeutics' drug Remodulin, a prostacyclin vasodilator used to treat PAH. Remodulin provided PAH patients with an alternative to GlaxoSmithKline's Flolan. By 2003, Remodulin annual sales had reached $50 million. By 2010, annual sales were $300 million and United Therapeutics' share price had increased 800 percent from the 1999 initial public offering price.

In 2011, United Therapeutics acquired Revivicor, a company focused on developing genetic biotechnology platforms to provide alternative tissue sources for treatment. With the acquisition of Revivicor, United Therapeutics began the xenokidney program to find alternative sources of organs for patients awaiting a kidney transplant. Xenotransplantation is a potential solution as it possibly could provide a limitless supply of organs.

In 2018, the company acquired SteadyMed, a medical device company developing injectable therapeutic drugs for pulmonary hypertension. Other acquisitions include SynQuest in 1999 and Cooke Pharma in 2000. United Therapeutics has entered numerous licensing agreements and collaborations with companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, DEKA Research & Development, MannKind Corporation, and the National Cancer Institute.

On January 7, 2022, a porcine heart provided by United Therapeutics' Revivicor subsidiary in conjunction with the University of Maryland Medical Center was used in the first pig-to-human transplant operation. The recipient subsequently died on March 8, 2022.

In October 2023, United Therapeutics purchased bioengineering company IVIVA Medical, Inc. for $50 million plus royalties. Sixteen IVIVA employees transferred to United Therapeutics.

In December 2023, United Therapeutics Corporation completed the acquisition of Miromatrix Medical Inc., a biotechnology company that specializes in the development of bioengineered organs composed of human cells.


## Medicines

United Therapeutics products are sold in the U.S. and Canada, and its products are available in Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia through various distribution partners. In the U.S., the company has received multiple approvals from the Food and Drug Administration. These cover various strengths and routes of administration for Orenitram, Remodulin, Tyvaso, and Tyvaso DPI, each indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are also indicated for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD).
United Therapeutics also markets Adcirca (tadalafil) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension under a licensing agreement with Eli Lilly and Company.

In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted clearance for the Unity Subcutaneous Delivery System for Remodulin Injection, also known as the Remunity pump, allowing the system to be used with drug cassettes that have been prefilled by specialty pharmacies. The Remunity system allows for constant, subcutaneous (under-the-skin) delivery of Remodulin. The Remunity system is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients older than 22.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In March 2015, the U.S. FDA approved United Therapeutics' Biologics License Application (BLA) for Unituxin. Unituxin is a monoclonal antibody used as a second-line treatment for children with high-risk neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer.

In May 2022, the U.S. FDA approved United Therapeutics' New Drug Application (NDA) for Tyvaso DPI. Tyvaso DPI is a dry powder inhaler containing treprostinil and is indicated for both PAH and PH-ILD.


## Research

United Therapeutics is advancing a pipeline of research and development projects that includes new indications, formulations, and delivery devices for its existing products. The company's R&D pipeline includes five registration phase studies, primarily in rare lung diseases, and seven preclinical product leads, primarily in organ manufacturing.

In February 2020, United Therapeutics reported that it had successfully completed the INCREASE study of Tyvaso in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and that the study met its primary endpoint of demonstrating improvement in six-minute walk distance (6MWD). The company submitted the INCREASE study results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in support of an efficacy supplement to the Tyvaso New Drug Application and received approval on March 31, 2021.

Ongoing clinical trials of new medicines include ADVANCE OUTCOMES (Phase 3) for ralinepag in pulmonary arterial hypertension; a registration study of the Centralized Lung Evaluation System; and TETON 1 and TETON 2 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

United Therapeutics is developing a unique type of biopharmaceutical medicinal product known as a manufactured organ. This type of biologic would be transplanted into the patient as a substitute for a failing organ. The company has regenerative medicine products such as these being developed via xenotransplantation, allogenic recellularization, and autologous bioprinting technologies.

In 2021, researchers at New York University used a ThymoKidney xenokidney in the first transplant of a genetically engineered, nonhuman kidney into a brain-dead human body, observing kidney function over 54 hours. Researchers at The University of Alabama at Birmingham used a UKidney xenokidney in a transplant into a brain-dead recipient, observing kidney function over 77 hours.

In 2021, engineers from the company's Unither Bioelectronics subsidiary conducted the first flight of human lungs for transplant from Toronto Western Hospital to Toronto General Hospital. The lungs were successfully transplanted into Alain Hodak, an engineer from Ottawa, Canada.

In 2022, the UHeart xenoheart was used in the first pig heart to living human transplant. The transplanted pig heart had ten genetic modifications to the pig genome.

In 2022, Martine Rothblatt debuted a 3D printed lung scaffold that was what she called one of the "most complex 3D printed objects ever printed." The printed lung scaffold contained 44 trillion voxels that laid out 4,000 kilometers of pulmonary capillaries and 200 million pulmonary alveoli.
