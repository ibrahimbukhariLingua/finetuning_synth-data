# Rebag



**Rebag** is a New York-based retail platform, established in 2014, that operates both online and through brick-and-mortar stores. It specializes in the buying, trading, and selling of luxury handbags, accessories, watches, fine jewelry, shoes, and select apparel.


## History

Rebag was established in 2014 by CEO Charles Albert Gorra under the parent company Trendly Incorporated. It functions as a digital and brick-and-mortar retail platform where customers can engage in the buying and selling of luxury designer handbags, accessories, watches, fine jewelry, shoes, and select apparel.

Rebag's inventory encompasses approximately 99 luxury brands, including well-known names such as Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Chanel, Prada, Cartier, Tiffany & Co., Rolex, Rick Owens, Maison Margiela, Christian Louboutin, and Gucci. Customers have the option to shop either online or in-store.

Since its establishment in 2014, the company has secured approximately $52 million in venture capital funding, with leading investors including General Catalyst, Novator, and FJ Labs.

In 2024, the company launched a pay now, buy later membership program.


## Locations

Based in New York City, Rebag currently manages nine brick-and-mortar stores. These include four in New York City (Soho, Madison Avenue, Westfield World Trade Center, and The Shops at Columbus Circle), two in the Los Angeles metro area (Beverly Hills and Westfield Santa Anita), two in Miami (Brickell City Centre and Dadeland Mall) and one in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The initial location in Soho, NYC, was initially conceived as a pop-up but later transitioned into a permanent flagship location. The design of the physical locations was orchestrated by Red Antler.

Another standalone store, known as Rebag Bar, was opened in NYC to adapt to changes in customer shopping behavior during the pandemic. At Rebag Bar, customers have the opportunity to swiftly sell their pre-owned luxury goods and browse for secondhand items.


## Products


### CLAIR by Rebag

An acronym for the Comprehensive Luxury Assessment Index for Resale, CLAIR is a data-driven evaluation software tool developed and launched by Rebag in 2019. It is designed to provide instant valuation of both new and pre-owned luxury handbags. It has been likened to the "Kelley Blue Book of Resale."


### Rebag Infinity

Rebag Infinity is a program offered by Rebag that enables customers to purchase a bag and use it for up to six months. After this period, customers can exchange the bag for store credit, which is valued at a minimum of 70 percent of the bag's original purchase price. This credit can then be applied towards the purchase of a new bag.


### Trade

Rebag provides the Trade option, which enables customers to buy and sell pre-owned luxury handbags, watches, accessories, fine jewelry, shoes, and select apparel. Through this option, customers can trade their once-loved items for credit, which can be applied towards their purchase on the same day.
