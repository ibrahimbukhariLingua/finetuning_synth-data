## Diversity

In April 2022, the brand received backlash as a behind the scenes shoot showed no models over a UK 8, raising concerns about Gymshark's commitments to body inclusivity.

Gymshark garnered attention for its proactive approach to addressing body shaming comments on social media. Hitting back at commenters that they can hit the unfollow button if they don't want to see this type of content, at one comment they responded "Whilst we do want to motivate people to reach their full potential, we also want them to know that if they're happy with where they are on their fitness journey, that's okay. People don't need to strive for an ideal body type or certain look."

In June 2022 Gymshark did a series of videos called "Pride in Progress" highlighting fitness diversity through a Pride campaign. Featuring Angel Flores a well-known transgender powerlifter and other's stories about finding their place in fitness spaces.

Gymshark has made efforts to promote inclusivity and diversity within its community. According to UK-based editorial Hyphen, Gymshark's collaboration with hijabi athletes has been praised for breaking down fitness barriers and advancing inclusivity. The brand has worked with figures such as Leana Deeb and Umaymah Makda to empower Muslim women athletes. Through these partnerships, Gymshark has developed clothing lines tailored to modest dressing preferences, including hijab-friendly designs. In August 2023, Gymshark unveiled a 3D billboard featuring Leana wearing a hijab, highlighting the brand's commitment to accommodating the religious practices of Muslim women during workouts and affirming their place within the community. Gymshark continues to collaborate with influencers like Leana to expand its range of inclusive options for customers.
