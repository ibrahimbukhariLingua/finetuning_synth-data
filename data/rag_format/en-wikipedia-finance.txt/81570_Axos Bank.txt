## History

**Axos Bank** was founded as **Bank of Internet USA** by Jerry Englert, the founder of Bank of Del Mar, and Gary Lewis Evans, president of La Jolla Bank, with $14 million of startup capital. It began operations as Bank of Internet on July 4, 2000. The start date of July 4 was purposely chosen because it showed that the bank would be open on a day that other banks were closed due to Independence Day and because the internet bank represented "Independence from traditional banking".

On October 1, 2018, BofI Holding re-branded as Axos Financial, and switched its stock exchange from NASDAQ to the NYSE. Bank of Internet was rebranded as Axos Bank.
