American Chamber of Commerce in Libya


# American Chamber of Commerce in Libya



AmCham Libya attracts US companies to the Libyan market by creating an environment for business matchmaking.

AmCham Libya’s goal is to represent American business interest. In the course of its lobbying activity, AmCham Libya regularly liaises with high-ranking members of the Libyan government and has established close working relationships with Libyan officials.


## Member of the US Chamber of Commerce

The US Chamber of Commerce does not recognize this organization, as per its official international directory.

The **United States Chamber of Commerce** is an American lobbying group whose aim is to represent American business interest around the world. In line with the traditions of such chambers, the USCC operates as an independent, non-governmental body. As one of the world’s largest business advocacy organizations, USCC currently has 115 affiliated members (AmChams) in 102 countries.

The Libyan member organization was established in 2011, shortly after the end of the revolution that led to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi’s regime. According to a statement published by the USCC, the organization views “the establishment of the AmCham Libya as a major show of support from the U.S. private sector for the political and economic aspirations of the people of Libya” and believes that its newly established subsidiary has the potential of “delivering real economic benefits to U.S. and Libyan companies and the region as a whole”.


## Organization

Despite its formal independence, AmCham Libya works closely together with the agencies of the American government, in particular with the US Department of Commerce and the local US Embassy.
