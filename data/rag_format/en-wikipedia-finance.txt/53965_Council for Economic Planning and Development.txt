The agency was established in 1948 as the **Council for United States Aid** (**CUSA**) which was established as part of the Sino-American Economic Aid Agreement signed between the Republic of China and the United States in the same year. In September 1963, CUSA was reformed as the **Council for International Economic Cooperation and Development** (**CIECD**) then as the **Economic Planning Council** (**EPC**) in 1973 to strengthen the planning and research functions of the Executive Yuan. In December 1977, the EPC was merged with the Finance and Economic Committee and reorganised as the **CEPD** to promote comprehensive national economic development. On 22 January 2014, CEPD was merged with Research, Development and Evaluation Commission to form the **National Development Council**.
