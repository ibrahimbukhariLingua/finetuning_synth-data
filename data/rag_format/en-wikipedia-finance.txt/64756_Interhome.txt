## History

The company was founded in London in 1965 by Bruno Franzen and Werner Frey under the company name Swiss Chalets, and later renamed Interhome after a merger in 1977. The company was taken over by Hotelplan in 1989.

In 1984, the company launched its „migratory bird“ logo, which still serves as an identifying feature even after the Corporate Design was rebranded in 2008.

Its Internet presence was established in 1998; online bookings have been possible since 1999. In 2009, the proportion of online bookings stood at around 60 per cent.

In 2011, Hotelplan announced its acquisition of Germany’s market leader Inter Chalet Ferienhaus by 1 November 2013. In 2012, Interhome agreed an ‘exclusive partnership’ with travel website TripAdvisor.
