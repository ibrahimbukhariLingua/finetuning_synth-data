## History

Crédit du Nord started in Lille in 1848. After buying a number of small banks, it was, in turn, acquired by Paribas between 1972 (35% owned) and 1988 (100% owned) but remained run as a separate network. In the following years several regional French banks were brought in the group while retaining their names.

In 1984, it was the fifth-ranking French banking group. It rebranded itself, after working with Creative Business (a public relations company), with a new logo, graphics of its name, the architecture of its branches, and public relations. It changed its logo from an orange cube to a blue star.

In 1997, the whole Crédit du Nord network with the associated banks was acquired by Société Générale from Paribas. Since 2000, Crédit du Nord is 80% owned by Société Générale and 20% by Dexia.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The customer-facing *SG Crédit du Nord (SG meaning Société Générale)* brand is applied to both the former Crédit du Nord, and the Société Générale branches in the North of France.

As with *SG Crédit du Nord*, the remaining Crédit du Nord banks' identities are also applied as regional brand names:

* *SG Tarneaud* in Centre-Val de Loire and in parts of Nouvelle-Aquitaine (the remaining of the branches in *Nouvelle-Aquitaine* are named *SG Sud-Ouest*)
* *SG Courtois* in Occitanie
* *SG SMC (for *Société Marseillaise de Crédit*)* in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur
* *SG Laydernier* in parts of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (the remaining of the branches in *Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes* are named *SG Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes*)

## Controversy

In 2010, the French government's *Autorité de la concurrence* (the department in charge of regulating competition) fined eleven banks, including Crédit du Nord, the sum of €384,900,000 for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, especially for extra fees charged during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.
