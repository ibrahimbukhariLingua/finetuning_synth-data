## History

Foxtons was founded by Jon Hunt in 1981 in Notting Hill, London, as a two-person estate agency.

2001 saw the launch of promotionally branded Minis, bearing the Foxtons logo.

Foxtons was acquired by private equity firm BC Partners in 2007 for £390 million.

In December 2009, private equity firm BC Partners lost control of Foxtons, less than three years after buying it, after creditors reorganised the real estate broker's debt.

On 27 August 2013, Foxtons unveiled its flotation on the London Stock Exchange to raise £55m from private investors.

On 1 July 2014, Michael Brown stepped down as CEO, citing personal reasons for his decision. Previous COO, Nic Budden took on the role of CEO.

In May 2022, Nic Budden stepped down as CEO and Peter Rollings took over as interim CEO; it was announced that Guy Gittins would take up the post on a permanent basis in September 2022.
