## History

Jumbo Interactive was founded by Mike Veverka in 1995 as a software developer and an Internet Service Provider in Queensland, Australia. In 1999, the company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange as Jumbomall.com

Focus shifted towards internet lotteries when the Interactive Gambling Act was passed by the Australian Parliament in 2001. Starting with smaller state-based charity lotteries, the company shifted to national lottery games with the acquisition of TMS Global Services in 2005. This business operated a lottery network since 1984 in various Pacific nations in agreement with Tattersalls. Jumbo acquired Manaccom, a software publisher, in 2007 and focus shifted towards the Internet and to the development of Oz Lotteries website, which continues to this day, having serviced in excess of 1.5 million customers.

In May 2017 Tatts Group invested $15.6 million in Jumbo, and acquired a 15% stake.

In November 2019, Jumbo acquired the UK lottery manager Gatherwell Limited, which creates, launches and manages lottery systems.

In November 2020, Jumbo signed an agreement with Lotterywest to provide its online software platform and services for up to the next 10 years.

In November 2022, it was announced Jumbo had completed the acquisition of the UK-based external lottery manager and digital payments business, StarVale Group.
