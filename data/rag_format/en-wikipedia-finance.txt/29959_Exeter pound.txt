## History

Previous to the Exeter Pound, local currencies were launched in the UK in Bristol (2012), Totnes (2006), Lewes (2008), Brixton (2009) and Stroud (2010).

The Exeter Pound was a local and community currency that was designed to improve the local economy of Exeter. It aimed to support independent local traders and enhance local economic activity. The scheme was run by the Exeter Pound Community Interest Company. It made a profit by setting an "expiry date" on each note, as identified in small print on the note itself, after which it could not be spent.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Exeter Pound CIC made the decision to discontinue the currency on 30 September 2018. Ian Martin, the company's director, claimed that societal moves toward cashless transactions and lack of regulatory framework to develop its own digital currency were key factors.
