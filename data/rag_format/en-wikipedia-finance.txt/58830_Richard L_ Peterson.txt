## Life

Peterson graduated from the University of Texas, with a BS *cum laude* in Electrical Engineering, a BA, and Doctor of Medicine degrees (M.D.). He performed postdoctoral neuroeconomics research at Stanford University, and is Board-certified in Psychiatry.

He founded and runs the sentiment analysis firm MarketPsych Data and ran the psychology-based quantitative asset management firm MarketPsy Capital. In the educational field he developed financial personality tests, published in academic journals and textbooks, and is an associate editor of the Journal of Behavioral Finance. In 2007, Peterson wrote the book Inside the Investor's Brain (Wiley), which translated behavioral finance concepts from academia to a lay audience. The book aggregated and reviewed research indicating that innate neurological influences predictably bias individual investor behavior. In 2016 he published Trading on Sentiment (Wiley), which explained quantitative research on media themes and sentiments that appear to drive asset prices in predictable patterns.

He lives in California with his family.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
