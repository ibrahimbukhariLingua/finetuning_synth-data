Renewable energy in Canada


# Renewable energy in Canada

 

**Renewable energy in Canada** represented 17.3% of the Total Energy Supply (TES) in 2020, following natural gas at 39.1% and oil at 32.7% of the TES.

In 2020, Canada produced 435 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity from renewable sources, representing 68% of its total electricity generation. Hydroelectric power was the primary source, accounting for 60% of the electricity mix. Over the last decade, wind and solar power generation in Canada saw considerable growth. Wind energy increased fourfold to 36 TWh, representing 5.6% of 2020's total electricity generation. Solar PV output grew from 0.3 TWh in 2010 to 4.3 TWh in 2020, accounting for 0.7%. Bioenergy, mainly from solid biomass, rose by 11%, making up 1.6% of the 2020 generation. As of 2021, Canada ranks as the fourth-largest producer of hydropower in the world by capacity.

From 2010 to 2017, the Environmental and Clean Technology (ECT) sector's growth rate outpaced Canada's overall economy by one-third. According to Simon Fraser University's Clean Energy Canada program, by June 2020, the sector employed 430,500 workers across Canada.


## Overview

According to a 2017 Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) document, renewable energy refers to energy sources that are replenished naturally and at a rate that is equal to or faster than the rate at which they are utilized. A variety of techniques and equipment in the environmental and clean technologies (ECT) sector have been developed and used to harness renewable resources for energy production.

*The Daily* reported in 2017, that the strong sales in renewable energy technologies and equipment reflected transitions made by Canada's towards a low-carbon economy. Companies engaged in these power generating projects including wind, solar, and hydro, reported revenues of $1.3 billion which represented 38% of total ECT sales.

In June 2021, the federal government invested $964-million program in ECT in the form of "wind, solar, storage, hydro, geothermal, tidal" and other renewable energy projects to lower emissions.

Politicians have expressed interest in increasing the percentage of Canada's electricity generated by renewable methods. Ontario has created a subsidy to assist wind and solar power producers.

All environmental and clean technology (ECT) activities accounted for 3.1% or $59.3 billion of the Canadian gross domestic product in 2016, edging up from 3.0% in 2007.


## Environmental and clean technology sector

The environmental and clean technology (ECT) sector includes goods and services that reduce environmental impact, such as such as renewable energy, clean electricity from wind, solar energy, and other renewable sources, power generation from nuclear sources, biofuels, waste management, and remediation services. Examples include designing and building structures that are energy-efficient and manufacturing solar panels, and Quebec's "municipal waste-to-energy industry".¹⁰

In 2019, the value of the Canadian environmental and clean technology products sector was $70.5 billion, compared to $59.3 billion in 2016, representing 3% of the Canadian GDP. From 2010 to 2017, the sector experienced a growth rate that was one-third higher than the rest of the country's economy. The environmental and clean technology (ECT) products sector saw a 3.5% increase in GDP from 2018 to 2019.

All environmental and clean technology (ECT) activities accounted for 3.1% or $59.3 billion of the Canadian gross domestic product in 2016, edging up from 3.0% in 2007.

Simon Fraser University's Clean Energy Canada program reported that there were 430,500 ECT sector jobs in Canada in 2020.

In 2019, there were 339,000 ECT jobs in Canada, representing 1.7% of all jobs. Sixty percent of ECT workers had at least a high school education, about 25% had a college degree and about 20% had a university degree. Over 90% of jobs in the sector were full-time.

In Canada and the United States, clean energy workers tend to earn higher wages than the national median.¹⁰ In 2019, in Canada, males in administrative and regulatory positions in the ECT sector earned an annual salary of $93,294 on average; while women earned less—$64,363. The average annual wage in Canada was $63,490 in 2019, while in the ECT sector it was $$77,144.
