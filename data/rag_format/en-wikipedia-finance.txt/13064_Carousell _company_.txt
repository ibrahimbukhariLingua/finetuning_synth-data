## History

Carousell was founded in Singapore on 14 May 2012, by co-founders Quek Siu Rui, Lucas Ngoo, and Marcus Tan.

The first item sold on Carousell was an Amazon Kindle e-reader for S$75. Carousell was subsequently registered as Carousell Pte. Ltd. on 2 January 2013.

Carousell received its first investment from Quest Ventures. In November 2013, Rakuten, with follow-on investments by Golden Gate Ventures, 500 Global (previously 500 Startups), and a few other investors invested $1 million in Carousell. Subsequently, in November 2014, Carousell announced that it received US$6 million in investment from Sequoia India. In August 2016, Carousell raised $35 million in their Series B funding round by Rakuten Ventures, Sequoia India, Golden Gate Ventures, and 500 Global. In October 2016, Carousell acquired Singaporean mobile-first used car marketplace and dealership tool Caarly. A consortium led by South Korean Internet giant Naver has struck an investment deal with classifieds platform Carousell worth US$80 million. Following the deal, the Singapore-headquartered start-up will be valued at over US$900 million.

As of 2016, over 23 million items had been sold on Carousell and users had created over 57 million listings of new and used items for sale.

Carousell has expanded regionally to several countries, including Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia. However, Carousell's expansion into Taiwan faces competition against headstart companies like Yahoo! and Ruten, which are already settled in the e-commerce market. In April 2019, Carousell acquired OLX Philippines after receiving an investment from Naspers.

The company raised $85 million Series C funding in May 2018. The round was co-led by existing investor Rakuten Ventures and EDBI. Other participants included 500 Global, Golden Gate Ventures and Sequoia India as well as new investor DBS.

On 21 November 2019, Carousell merged with Telenor's 701Search to creates a regional leader in online classifieds across 8 markets in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Mudah, Chotot and OneKyat which were owned by 701Search will retain their individual brands and platforms, continuing operations in Malaysia, Vietnam and Myanmar respectively following the merger.

In June 2021, Bloomberg reported that Carousell is planning a SPAC merger. In September 2021, Carousell announced that it had raised US$100 million in a round of funding led by South Korean private equity firm STIC Investments, bringing its valuation to US$1.1 billion.

Carousell Protection is its secure in-app payment feature that allows buyer and seller to make payment and complete the deal on Carousell, through credit/debit card or DBS PayLah!. Some features include that the payment be held by Carousell until both buyer and seller are satisfied with the transaction, and that buyers and sellers are given a platform to raise and resolve issues with their order in the app.
