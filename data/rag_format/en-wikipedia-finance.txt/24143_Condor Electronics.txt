## History and growth

Condor Electronics, a subsidiary of the Benhamadi Group, was established in 2002, specializing in electronics and home appliances.

By 2012, Condor Electronics announced it had captured 35% of the Algerian market for computers and home appliances. In 2013, marking its 10th year of operation, Condor reported that exports to Tunisia and Jordan had generated approximately five million euros, boosting its turnover by 25%.

In June 2013, the company launched its first smartphone, the Condor C-1, followed by the more powerful C-4 in September of the same year. The C-6, a high-end smartphone, was released in April 2014. This was followed by the C-8 and the C-4+ in various colors. In 2014, Condor allocated $100 million to investments, and its profit margin increased between 20% and 40%.

In June 2015, after declaring its intention to enter the European market, Condor announced that 30,000 units of its new smartphone, the Griffe W1, had been sold in France. According to Jeune Afrique's ranking of the 500 largest African companies in 2015, Condor ranked 15th among Algerian companies and 281st overall in Africa. That same year, the company's turnover reached 93 billion dinars.

In January 2017, Condor became the first manufacturer in Africa and the MENA region to develop 8K technology. On 20 April 2017, Condor opened its first showroom in Tunisia.

In February 2018, at the MWC 2018, Condor Electronics' African market director announced that the company was expanding its presence in Europe, particularly in France, with the Allure M3 smartphone as its flagship product.

However, in August 2019, Condor's CEO, Abderrahmane Benhamadi, was placed in pre-trial detention following a corruption investigation. He was temporarily released in April 2020 but was later sentenced to four years in prison, with two years suspended, for illegal contracts and obtaining undue advantages.

Typically targeting the general public, Condor launched a dedicated tablet for children in June 2015, called the Tab Kids (model TGW-709).
