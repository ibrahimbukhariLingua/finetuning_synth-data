**Michael Sievert** is an American business executive, currently the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of T-Mobile US, and a member of the company's board of directors. In November 2019, T-Mobile announced that Sievert would be promoted from chief operating officer (COO) to CEO in May 2020 when John Legere stepped down. Sievert took control a month earlier than planned, on April 1, 2020, the same day T-Mobile closed its merger with Sprint.


## Early life and education

Sievert was born in Canton, Ohio. At age 10, he became a paper carrier for *The Repository*, using his earnings to buy a Radio Shack TRS-80 and, later, a Commodore 64. He graduated from GlenOak High School in 1987 and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1991.


## Career

Sievert started his career at Procter & Gamble, where he oversaw brands such as Pepto-Bismol and Crest. He subsequently worked at IBM and Clearwire. He was also executive vice president (EVP) and chief global marketing and sales officer at E-Trade and CEO of tablet gaming company Discovery Bay Games. From 2002 to 2005, Sievert was EVP and CMO of AT&T Wireless. He joined Microsoft's Global Windows Group as corporate vice president of product management in 2005, leading preparations for the release of Longhorn (later called Windows Vista). In 2008 he co-founded Switchbox Labs, a startup acquired by Lenovo in 2009. In 2012, John Legere, T-Mobile's then-new CEO, hired Sievert as CMO.

Sievert became COO of T-Mobile in 2015, then became the company's president in 2018. During this time, Sievert oversaw the "Un-carrier" marketing campaign, which sought to rebrand T-Mobile's public image with a focus on no overage charges, no contracts, unlimited data, and other offerings. In April 2020, Sievert succeeded Legere as CEO of T-Mobile. Under Sievert's leadership, T-Mobile surpassed 100 million total customers, and created the first nationwide standalone 5G network in the U.S. Sievert has declared his strategy of focusing on dominating in 5G, saying “We’re making the rules for the 5G era because we’re way ahead — and I mean miles ahead."

In October 2017, he joined the board of Canadian company Shaw Communications.

In 2023, Sievert and Mint Mobile owner Ryan Reynolds announced T-Mobile's plans to acquire both Ultra Mobile and Mint Mobile.

In 2023, Sievert's total compensation at T-Mobile was $37.5 million, up 29% from the previous year and representing a CEO-to-median worker pay ratio of 521-to-1.

In January 2024, Starbucks added Sievert to its board of directors. He also delivered the commencement speech at the Wharton School Master of Business Administration graduation ceremony in May 2024.


## Political issues

In June 2020, Sievert decided to pull all T-Mobile advertisements from Tucker Carlson Tonight because of rhetoric that criticized the Black Lives Matter movement. When announcing the move, Sievert tweeted, "Bye-bye, Tucker Carlson!" Sievert also published an open letter about T-Mobile's diversity, equity and inclusion programs.


## Personal life

Sievert is married and has two adult sons. He lives in Kirkland, Washington.
