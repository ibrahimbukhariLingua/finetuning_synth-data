Morrison & Co


# Morrison & Co



**Morrison & Co** is a specialist global infrastructure manager, investing in both private and listed markets, with offices in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, United States and Singapore.


## History

Morrison was founded in 1988 by Lloyd Morrison to offer a broad range of investment advisory services to private and public sectors in New Zealand and Australia. In the early 1990s Morrison & Co narrowed its focus to infrastructure investment and advisory services as major privatisations took place in Australia and New Zealand.

After launching Infratil in 1994, Morrison became an increasingly active investor and adviser in privatisations of Australasian airports, ports and energy businesses. In 2009, Morrison launched the Public Infrastructure Partnership Fund, New Zealand's first fund dedicated to investing in public private partnerships.

In 2018, Morrison established the Morrison & Co Growth Infrastructure Fund, a co-mingled fund targeting risk-adjusted returns through unlisted infrastructure assets with a strong sustainability focus. Also in 2018, Morrison took over management of Utilities Trust of Australia (UTA) and its portfolio of core infrastructure assets. During the following three years, Morrison expanded its presence outside New Zealand and Australia into Asia, Europe, UK and North America.

In 2021, Morrison raised USD 3 billion for a new open-ended global infrastructure fund.

In 2022, Paul Newfield became Morrison's third CEO, following Marko Bogoievski.

In 2023, Morrison changes its brand name from Morrison & Co to Morrison.
