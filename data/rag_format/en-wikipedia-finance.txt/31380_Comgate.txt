## History

In 2000, students Nikolaj Šťáhlavský and Michal Rychna founded SmartNET, s.r.o., which created mobile versions of websites. Of the original founders, Nikolaj Šťáhlavský remained the majority shareholder in the company. In 2002, the company changed its name to Comgate and was transformed into a joint stock company. The service offering was expanded to include a real-time consumer contest data processing platform. It began to operate high-capacity connectors to mobile operators, enabling the processing of regular and premium SMS, and to offer payment processing services via premium SMS.

In 2010, Comgate obtained a license for payment services from the Czech National Bank and started to mediate card payments on the Internet. In 2016, the CNB expanded the license to Payment Institution, which allows the company to process unlimited volumes of transactions throughout the EU. In 2017, the license was expanded to include registration with the National Bank of Slovakia. In 2017, Jakub Ouhrabka, who joined the company in 2000 as head of development, later became a shareholder of the company, became the company's CEO.
