## History

Men's Shop OS was founded in Ube, Yamaguchi. It was rebranded as Ogori Shōji in Yamaguchi-shi in March 1949. On 2 June 1984, it opened a unisex casual wear store in Fukuro-machi, Naka-ku, Hiroshima named Unique Clothing Warehouse. Initially, the brand was going to be registered as a shortened contraction of "unique clothing". In 1988, during administration work in Hong Kong for registering the brand, "C" was misread as "Q". Tadashi Yanai, the head of the family retail conglomerate, liked the error, and shortened the name to "Uniqlo" across Japan. In September 1991, the name of the company was changed from "Ogori Shōji" to "Fast Retailing". By April 1994 there were over 100 Uniqlo stores operating throughout Japan.

In 1997, Fast Retailing adopted a set of strategies from American retailer The Gap, known as "SPA" (for specialty-store/retailer of private label apparel), meaning that they would produce their own clothing and sell it exclusively.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Uniqlo outsourced their clothing manufacturing to factories in China, where labour was cheap.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Japan was in the depths of a recession at the time, and the low-cost goods proved popular. Their advertising campaigns, clothing quality and new retail layouts also proved fruitful.

In November 1998, it opened their first urban Uniqlo store in Tokyo's Harajuku district, and outlets soon spread to major cities throughout Japan.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 2001, sales turnover and gross profit reached a peak, with over 500 retail stores in Japan.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ When Uniqlo decided to expand overseas, it separated Uniqlo from the parent company, and established Fast Retailing (Jiangsu) Apparel Co., Ltd. in China. In 2002, their first Chinese Uniqlo outlet was opened in Shanghai, along with four overseas outlets in London and Basingstoke, England.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 1 November 2005, Fast Retailing transferred the business related to clothing manufacturing and retailing to Sun Road Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary that operated golf courses through a company split (absorption-type split), and became a holding company. On the same day, Sun Road changed its name to Uniqlo Co., Ltd.

2005 saw more overseas expansion, with stores opening in the United States (New York City), Hong Kong (Tsim Sha Tsui) and South Korea (Seoul), their South Korean expansion being part of a joint venture with Lotte.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ By 2006, sales were $4 billion. By April 2007, the company had set a global sales goal of $10 billion and a ranking among the top five global retailers, joining Gap, H&M, Inditex and Limited Brands.

Fast Retailing signed a design consulting contract for Uniqlo products with fashion designer Jil Sander in March 2009. Sander was appointed creative director of the brand's menswear and womenswear.

On 2 September 2009, Fast Retailing announced that the company would target annual group sales of 5 trillion yen (approx. US$61.2 billion) and pretax profit from operations of 1 trillion yen (approx. US$12.2 billion) by 2020. This meant that the company was aiming to be the world's biggest specialty retailer of private label apparel. The company also aimed for a growth rate of 20% per year. The 5 trillion figure included one trillion yen from Uniqlo's Japan business, three trillion yen from its international business, and one trillion yen from "Japan-related and global brand business."ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠʸ The company's international business target included one trillion yen in China, one trillion in other Asian countries and one trillion in Europe and the United States.

## Controversies

In January 2015, labor rights violations were reported at Uniqlo suppliers in China. Uniqlo pledged to remedy the violations.

In June 2015, Chinese Uniqlo factory demonstrated after a factory closure, with support from the Hong Kong-based activist group Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM).

In November 2015, investigations into the measures Uniqlo introduced in the wake of the January 2015 revelations found that the remedies had been only partially successful, with significant violations continuing to occur.

In October 2016, the report *This Way to Dystopia: Exposing UNIQLO's Abuse of Chinese Garment Workers* by SACOM and War on Want claimed that "excessive overtime, low pay, dangerous working conditions and oppressive management" were still common in Uniqlo factories in China and Cambodia.

In 2019, a number of Australian workers reported that bullying and harassment is rife, there were "shouting rooms", and a toxic work culture. They claimed they had to work 18-hour days, had to fold seven shirts per minute, and that everyone leaves with "some form of PTSD".

In the same year, a Uniqlo advert caused significant backlash in South Korea. The line "I can't remember that far back" was subtitled in Korean, "How can I remember, it was over 80 years ago?", trivializing the trauma of comfort women.

In January 2021, Uniqlo shirts were blocked at the US border over concerns of violations related to a ban on cotton products produced in Xinjiang due to reports of forced labour. A protest was filed by Uniqlo's parent company Fast Retailing, but was denied.

At the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Fast Retailing initially decided to remain in Russia, saying that clothing is a "necessity of life". Following backlash, on 10 March 2022 the company announced it would stop operating in Russia, citing "a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation."
