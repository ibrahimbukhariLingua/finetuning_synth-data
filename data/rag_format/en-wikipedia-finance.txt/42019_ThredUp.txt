## Business model

The ThredUp marketplace provides services both to consumers and business. In B2C they provide two separate services: One to customers who want to sell their used clothes. The company sends those customers a free “Clean Out Kit” which is a bag in which they can send all the used clothes they want with free shipping. ThredUp sorts, evaluates and presents the clothes for selling. The customer receives compensation via a cash payment or online credit and is also given the option to donate to charity. The second service is to customers who can use their page to find and purchase clothes shorted by brand, type or style.

ThredUp also offers a B2B service to brand retailers. Through resale as a service (RaaS) partnerships they give the fashion brands Clean Out Kits that they can use to provide a return service to their own customers in exchange for in-store credit.
