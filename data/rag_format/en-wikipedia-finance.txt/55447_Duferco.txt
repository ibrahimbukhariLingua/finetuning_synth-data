**Duferco Participations Holding SA**, is a company based in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. Its main business is trading, producing, importing and exporting steel.


## History

Duferco was founded in 1979 by Italian Bruno Bolfo. His goal was to learn from Brazil from worldwide steel export. In 1982, the company moved its headquarters from New York and São Paulo to Lugano. Initially active only in the steel trade, Duferco also expanded its activities to the commodities trade in the early 1990s, in particular with raw materials for the steel industry such as coke, coal, iron ore, pig iron or sponge iron.

With the acquisition in 1996 of the Italian *Ferdofin Siderurgica* (later renamed *Duferdofin*) Duferco rose in the steel production. Later, the company acquired additional steel mills, especially in Italy, Belgium and Eastern Europe.

After the turn of the millennium, Duferco split its activities with, among other things, its entry into the energy, shipping and logistics sectors.
