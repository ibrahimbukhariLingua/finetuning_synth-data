Moneypoint power station


# Moneypoint power station



**Moneypoint power station** (Irish: *Stáisiún cumhachta Ghob na Muine*) is Ireland's largest electricity generation station (with an output 915 MW) and its only coal-fired power station. Commissioned between 1985 and 1987, it is located on the River Shannon, near Kilrush in County Clare, and was constructed at a cost of more than £700m. The station operates largely on coal, making it both unique in the context of Irish electricity production and for a while was the country's single largest emitter of greenhouse gases. At its peak, it was capable of meeting around 25% of customer demand across the country. But by 2023, coal's share of the electricity fuel mix in Ireland had fallen to 4%.

In 2021, its owner, the ESB Group, announced the facility would be closed and replaced with a green-energy hub.

It has two Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) storage tanks with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes which can be used as a back-up fuel if required.

Three Brown Boveri four-cylinder, single-shaft impulse reaction turbines are directly connected to three generators which generate the power. The steam is generated by three Foster Wheeler two-pass boilers, which convert water into high pressure steam by combustion of the coal.

The power station chimneys, at 218m, are the tallest free-standing structures in Ireland.


## History

Moneypoint was under construction from 1979 to 1987. Before its construction, Ireland depended heavily on imported oil for its energy. The 1970s sharp increase in oil prices over a short period of time led the government and the Electricity Supply Board to choose coal as a fuel, as it was seen as a plentiful resource with a stable price.

A flywheel synchronous condenser to stabilize the grid was ordered for operation at Moneypoint by 2022.

In 2019, the government launched its climate action plan which included a commitment to end the burning of coal in Moneypoint by 2025, and replace coal-fired generation with "low-carbon and renewable technologies". One option being explored is a 400 MW floating wind farm with an onshore hydrogen facility.

The plant was planned to be closed in 2025 but operation was extended to 2029.
