Schoeller family


# Schoeller family



The **Schoeller family** is a German noble family. Originally from the Rhineland, the family had extensive business holdings throughout Europe for many a generation.


## History

While most members of the family initially worked as Reidemeister (metal manufacturers) in the Eifel, beginning in the 18th century, they became founders, shareholders and managers of numerous companies in the textile, paper, sugar and steel industries as well as in packaging technology. They also formed Schoellerbank, a trading and banking house in Vienna which was founded initially as a wholesaler in 1833. They were also involved in the coal mining industry, in the construction and railway industry, in breweries and with other banking and trading houses. In addition to their original home towns of Schleiden, Gemünd and Hellenthal in the Eifel, their companies were primarily located in the Düren-Jülich area, the towns of Eitorf, Osnabrück as well as Wrocław, Edelény, Prague, Brno, Zurich, Bregenz, Ternitz, Berndorf, Vienna and other locations worldwide.

A large number of family members are still active in public or political offices, holding appointments as city councillors, as members of the Prussian House of Representatives or the House of Lords of the Imperial Council of Austria, as board members in chambers of commerce and industry, as honorary consuls, or as members of numerous supervisory and administrative boards as well as company boards.

Several members of the "Brno" and "Vienna branches" were elevated to the hereditary Austrian nobility in 1863 with the title of Knight, and Sir Paul Eduard von Schoeller was elevated to the British nobility as Knight Bachelor. However, in 1919, all living family members and their descendants were required to remove the additions *Ritter* and *von* from their names if they had accepted citizenship in the Republic of Austria, due to the Law on the Abolition of Nobility of April 1919.
