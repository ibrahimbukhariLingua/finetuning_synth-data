## History

Info Edge was founded by Sanjeev Bikhchandani in 1995, initially reproducing classified ads from newspapers on its website. In April 1997, Bikhchandani started Naukri.com with help from his brother and friends. It then launched Jeevansathi.com in 1998, 99acres.com in 2005 and Shiksha.com in 2008. Info Edge went public in 2006 under the ticker symbol "Naukri". It launched offshoots of Naukri such as NaukriGulf.com for Gulf countries in 2006 and FirstNaukri.com for campus recruitment in 2009.

Info Edge was one of the early investors of Eternal Limited (then known as FoodieBay) and reportedly invested in Policybazaar in 2008 before its website was launched. Between 2010 and 2013, Info Edge invested a total of ₹86 crore in Eternal Limited across four rounds and became the controlling shareholder in Eternal Limited. Eternal Limited ceased to be a subsidiary of Info Edge in September 2015.

In 2020, the company set up an alternative investment arm called Info Edge Ventures under which it started Info Edge Venture Fund, a venture capital fund to invest in early-stage technology startups. As of 2022, Info Edge Ventures has three investment funds–Info Edge Venture Fund, Info Edge Capital, and Capital 2B.
