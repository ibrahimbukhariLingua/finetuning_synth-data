# AirAsia



**Capital A Berhad** (MYX: 5099), operating as **AirAsia** (stylized as ***airasia***) is a Malaysian multinational low-cost airline headquartered near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Established in 1993 and commencing operations in 1996, the airline is the largest in Malaysia by fleet size and destinations. It operates scheduled domestic and international flights to over 166 destinations across 25 countries. Its primary hub is Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), where it utilizes Terminal 2, the low-cost carrier terminal.

AirAsia has a network of affiliate airlines catering to regional markets, including Thai AirAsia, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippines AirAsia and AirAsia Cambodia, which have bases in cities including Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila and Phnom Penh. AirAsia X, the airline’s long-haul subsidiary, primarily serves long-distance routes. In addition to passenger services, AirAsia manages Teleport, its dedicated freight division. Together, these carriers form an extensive network connecting Southeast Asia with other parts of Asia, Australia and the Middle East.


## History


### 1993-2001: Foundation and Early Years

AirAsia was established on December 20, 1993, by DRB-HICOM, a Malaysian government-owned conglomerate, as a full-service carrier. The airline commenced operations on November 18, 1996, with its inaugural flight from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi, utilising a Boeing 737-300. In its early years, AirAsia faced challenges such as high operating costs and competition from established carriers like Malaysia Airlines.

By the late 1990s, AirAsia had accumulated substantial debts, amounting to approximately MYR 40 million (around US$10.5 million). Efforts to stabilise the airline included route expansion, leasing aircraft for Hajj charters and internal discussions about potential management changes.

However, these initiatives were insufficient to address the airline's structural issues. The situation deteriorated further following the global aviation downturn after the September 11 attacks. By September 2001, AirAsia’s debt had risen to around US$11 million, leaving the company on the brink of collapse.


### 2001-2002: Transformation into a Low-Cost Carrier

On September 5, 2001, Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun acquired AirAsia through their company Tune Air Sdn Bhd for a nominal sum of one ringgit (approximately US$0.26), taking on its considerable liabilities. Fernandes, a former executive at Time Warner (now known as Warner Bros. Discovery), saw an opportunity to transform AirAsia into a low-cost carrier, inspired by the success of airlines such as Southwest Airlines and Ryanair. This acquisition marked a turning point in AirAsia’s history, setting the stage for its reinvention as a budget airline.

After the acquisition, Fernandes and his team rebranded the airline as a low-cost carrier on January 15, 2002. This strategic shift involved adopting a no-frills service model, enabling AirAsia to offer fares that were significantly lower than those of its competitors, particularly Malaysia Airlines. Promotional fares began as low as MYR 10 (approximately US$2.63), which attracted a large number of passengers.

In its first year under the low-cost model, AirAsia achieved profitability, marking a significant recovery from its previous financial challenges. The airline focused on point-to-point routes and utilised secondary airports, which helped lower operational costs and improve overall efficiency.


### 2003-2006: Entry into New Markets

Between 2003 and 2006, AirAsia embarked on a rapid expansion of its routes and infrastructure. In December 2003, the airline established a second hub at Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru, expanding its operational reach. AirAsia also began its international operations with flights to Phuket in December 2003, followed by services to Bangkok in February 2004. By April 2005, the airline further broadened its network by adding Manila and Xiamen to its destinations.

AirAsia was also quick to embrace technological advancements, becoming a pioneer in the region. In 2002, the airline introduced ticketless travel via online bookings, becoming the first airline in Asia to do so. This innovation revolutionized ticket purchasing. Additionally, the airline launched SMS booking services, allowing customers to book flights directly from their mobile phones.

The growth of affiliate airlines played a key role in AirAsia’s expansion strategy. In 2003, Thai AirAsia was founded, and in 2005, Indonesia AirAsia was launched. These affiliates allowed the airline to enter new markets, strengthening its regional presence across Southeast Asia.

By the end of 2006, AirAsia’s fleet had seen substantial growth, consisting of 35 Boeing 737-300s and eight Airbus A320s. Additionally, the airline placed orders for 100 more Airbus A320 aircraft, which helped increase its capacity and frequency of flights, supporting its expanding network.


### 2006-2012: Market Expansion and Hub Development

In late 2006, AirAsia's CEO Tony Fernandes introduced a five-year plan designed to strengthen the airline's presence across Asia. The strategy focused on enhancing connectivity between existing destinations and expanding into new markets such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Southern China and India. As part of this effort, Kota Kinabalu became a hub on 7 July 2006, followed by Kuching on 20 July 2006. These initiatives led to a significant increase in passenger traffic, with AirAsia carrying about 13.9 million passengers in 2007, compared to 5.7 million in 2006.

AirAsia expanded its offerings further in 2009 by launching Redbox, the world’s first low-cost courier service. The same year, the airline began flights from Penang to Hong Kong, adding Penang as another hub in its network.

In 2011, AirAsia entered into a controversial share swap agreement with Malaysia Airlines, aiming to reduce competition between the two carriers. However, due to regulatory concerns, this partnership was dissolved in early 2012, marking a setback for AirAsia's ambitions to strengthen its domestic market. Despite this, the airline remained committed to its strategy of expanding its regional and international networks.


### 2013-2019: Strategic Developments and Challenges

Between 2013 and 2019, AirAsia continued its expansion strategy, both by launching new routes and growing its affiliate network. Notably, the airline established Philippines AirAsia and AirAsia Japan in 2012, followed by AirAsia India in 2014. Despite its focus on growth, AirAsia’s efforts to establish airlines in countries such as China, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam were hindered by various challenges and practical constraints.

In 2014, AirAsia made another significant advancement by becoming the first Malaysian airline to offer onboard Wi-Fi services through its subsidiary, Tune Box. This innovation responded to the increasing demand for connectivity among travelers, reinforcing AirAsia's reputation as a leader in in-flight services.

By 2018, AirAsia introduced Teleport, a logistics venture under its digital division, to enhance its cargo and e-commerce capabilities. Teleport has since become a significant logistics provider, utilising AirAsia’s network to serve businesses and e-commerce platforms across Asia Pacific and beyond, including key hubs such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Incheon, Narita, Bangalore and Sydney.

During this period, AirAsia continued to earn accolades for its service quality, further solidifying its position as a leading low-cost airline. The airline was awarded the title of World's Best Low-Cost Airline by Skytrax for an impressive eleven consecutive years, from 2009 to 2019.


### 2020–2023: Navigating the Pandemic and Recovery

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the global aviation industry, and AirAsia was no exception. In March 2020, the airline suspended most of its flights due to travel restrictions, resulting in significant revenue losses. This unprecedented situation forced AirAsia to rapidly adapt in order to survive. The airline grounded its fleet and implemented various cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and salary reductions for employees. AirAsia also focused on maintaining liquidity by securing loans and receiving government support.

During this challenging period, AirAsia accelerated its digital transformation. In late 2020, the airline launched the Airasia Super App, diversifying its business model beyond air travel to include services such as food delivery, e-commerce and logistics. This move was aimed at adapting to changing consumer behaviors and maintaining a steady revenue stream in the face of reduced air travel.

As vaccination rates increased and travel restrictions began to ease in 2021, AirAsia gradually resumed its operations. The airline restarted domestic flights within Malaysia in April 2021, focusing initially on rebuilding its domestic network before reintroducing international routes. By late 2022, AirAsia began reinstating international routes, prioritizing key markets within ASEAN and beyond. The airline targeted popular destinations in Thailand, Indonesia and India to restore its pre-pandemic network.

AirAsia's recovery continued throughout 2022, as demand for travel rebounded. By the end of the year, the airline had carried approximately 9.95 million passengers. In 2023, AirAsia significantly increased its capacity, with a nine-fold increase in available seats compared to the previous year. This expansion was driven by the resumption of routes and the addition of new aircraft to its fleet. Additionally, the airline expanded its international network by reintroducing routes between Thailand and China, capitalizing on the growing demand from travelers eager to visit these popular destinations.


### 2024–Present: Strategic Reorganisation and Global Ambitions

On 8 January 2024, AirAsia X signed a non-binding agreement with Capital A to fully acquire AirAsia Bhd and AirAsia Aviation Group Limited (AAAGL), which oversees AirAsia’s affiliates outside Malaysia. The plan involves merging AirAsia Malaysia, Indonesia AirAsia, Philippines AirAsia and AirAsia Cambodia under the AirAsia X brand. Initially, the creation of a new entity, AirAsia Group Berhad, was proposed, but by August 2024, the decision was made to directly acquire AirAsia and AAAGL instead. This acquisition, expected to be finalized by the end of 2024, is projected to provide access to over 200 aircraft and 361 future aircraft orders from Capital A's aviation portfolio, integrating narrow-body and wide-body aircraft into a unified fleet. This enhanced fleet aims to improve operational efficiency, expand service offerings and bolster AirAsia’s competitive position across key market segments.

In March 2024, AirAsia launched its first flights to Perth in Australia using Airbus A321neo aircraft. This marked a milestone as the airline expanded its reach beyond Asia, a role previously handled by its long-haul affiliate, AirAsia X. By late 2024, AirAsia outlined ambitious plans to position Kuala Lumpur International Airport as a key global aviation hub. As part of this expansion strategy, the airline aims to increase its fleet size from 79 to 92 aircraft by the end of 2024, while boosting daily flights from 230 to 258. Additionally, AirAsia plans to add eight new destinations to its network, bringing the total number of destinations to 106, up from 98.

To support its operational growth, AirAsia is considering acquiring up to 100 smaller regional aircraft to enhance its fleet diversity and efficiency. Discussions are underway with Airbus, Comac and Embraer, with potential options including the Airbus A220, Comac C919 and Embraer E2 families. These aircraft would complement AirAsia's existing Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft, enabling the airline to better serve secondary routes and adapt to market demands.

As part of its restructuring, Capital A, AirAsia's parent company, took significant steps to resolve its financial challenges. Capital A had been classified under Practice Note 17 (PN17) due to financial difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. PN17 is a status issued by Malaysia’s stock exchange, Bursa Malaysia, to companies facing financial distress, requiring them to submit a recovery plan to remain publicly listed. In December 2024, Capital A submitted its proposed regularisation plan to exit PN17, which includes a reduction of accumulated losses and the disposal of its aviation businesses to AirAsia X. The company aims to complete the process and exit PN17 by the first quarter of 2025, once all necessary approvals are in place. This move is designed to restore the company’s financial health, improve investor confidence and support long-term growth.

Looking beyond the immediate future, AirAsia’s long-term vision focuses on expanding its reach to strategic markets across the Pacific and East Asia, with further ambitions to enter Africa, Europe and North America by 2030. This global expansion strategy underscores AirAsia's aim to enhance its position as a leading low-cost carrier, connecting more regions and catering to a broader, international customer base.


## Destinations

AirAsia has rapidly expanded its domestic and international network since its rebranding as a low-cost carrier in 2001. The airline's primary hub is located at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), where it operates a substantial portion of its flights. AirAsia operates a broad domestic network within Malaysia, connecting numerous cities and regional hubs across the country. Key destinations include major cities like Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching.

Internationally, AirAsia operates numerous routes across Southeast Asia and beyond, offering destinations in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and mainland China. The airline has also expanded into other regions, including India and Australia. This broad network has enabled AirAsia to become a significant player in the regional and international aviation markets, catering to both business and leisure travelers.

In addition to its primary operations at KLIA’s low-cost terminal, AirAsia (Malaysia) has developed secondary hubs to enhance regional connectivity. These hubs include Penang International Airport which acts as a gateway in northern Peninsular Malaysia, Kota Kinabalu International Airport and Kuching International Airport facilitating travel in Malaysian Borneo and Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru, which serves the southern region of Peninsular Malaysia and provides convenient access to and from Singapore. Together, these hubs play a vital role in supporting AirAsia’s extensive network, ensuring that the airline can efficiently serve its domestic and international markets.

### Fleet renewal and development

Previously operating the Boeing 737-300, AirAsia has now completely converted to the Airbus A320 family.

In June 2011, AirAsia ordered 200 Airbus A320neos at the Paris Air Show. The planes were originally due to become available in 2015, and the deal was one of the largest ever for commercial aircraft in a single order. The deal was worth US$18 billion at list prices, although AirAsia will have obtained a substantial discount from those prices. The deal makes AirAsia Airbus' single biggest customer. On 13 December 2012, AirAsia placed an order for an additional 100 Airbus A320 jets, splitting it between 64 A320neo and 36 A320ceo.

At the Farnborough International Air Show in 2016, AirAsia ordered 100 A321neos at an estimated cost of US$12.6 Billion dollars at list prices. AirAsia planned to fly these larger aircraft to airports that had infrastructure constraints. AirAsia received its first A320neo in September 2016.

At the 2019 Farnborough Air Show, AirAsia further increased its orders for A320 aircraft, in the process also becoming Airbus' largest customer for the A321neo variant. With this order, the total number of orders that AirAsia had placed for the Airbus A320 family climbed to 592, reaffirming the carrier's position also as the largest airline customer for the Airbus single aisle product line. However, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, the orders for the new A320 family of aircraft were reworked by mutual agreement between AirAsia and Airbus in October 2021, with deliveries now scheduled to extend to 2035, among other undisclosed changes in purchase terms.

## Corporate affairs

The head office is the Red Quarters (RedQ) at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Selangor. This facility also serves as the company's registered office.

The airline has moved its head office to a new 56,985.1 m² (613,383 sq ft), RM140mil facility constructed at klia2 on 7 November 2016. Until the new head office opened, the airline's head office was located in the KLIA LCCT. The new klia2 head office has been scheduled to open at the end of 2015. The former registered office was on level 13 of the Menara Prima Tower B in Petaling Jaya.

RedQ is scheduled to hold about 2,000 AirAsia and AirAsia X employees. Aireen Omar, the AirAsia Country CEO of Malaysia, stated that the headquarters needed to be redesigned because in the klia2 plans the location of the control tower had been changed. Construction on the facility was scheduled to begin in July 2014. Malaysia Airports Holdings is leasing the land that will be occupied by the headquarters. January Ann Baysa, an AirAsia X flight attendant from the Philippines, gave the building the name "RedQuarters" or "RedQ". Its groundbreaking ceremony was held in November 2014.

In May 2022, AirAsia announced the introduction of its ride-hailing service in Thailand, AirAsia Ride. Thailand is the second country AirAsia is expanding the e-hailing services in, directly competing with the dominant player, Grab.

## Criticism and controversy


### Barisan Nasional-themed flight

Before the 2018 Malaysian general election, AirAsia received criticism for seemingly backing Najib Razak and his Barisan Nasional coalition, a move seen as politically incorrect by some political commentators. Najib was seen returning from Sabah to Kuala Lumpur after a campaign trip on an AirAsia flight together with AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes. The aeroplane that Najib flew was draped in the blue of BN with the air stewardesses dressed in that same blue, instead of the typical AirAsia red. The words "Hebatkan Negaraku" (English: "Make my country greater") can also be seen across the fuselage of the aeroplane. After Najib was defeated in the general election, Tony Fernandes issued an apology, claiming that he had buckled under the intense pressure from Najib's government.


### Other controversies and issues

In 2007, passengers from "The Barrier-Free Environment and Accessible Transport Group" protested against the airline over its refusal to fly passengers who were completely immobile. They claimed that people with disabilities were discriminated against when booking tickets online; the CEO of the airline said it did not turn away passengers in wheelchairs.
