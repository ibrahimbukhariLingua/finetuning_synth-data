India Government Mint


# India Government Mint



The **India Government Mint** (ISO: *Bh캐rata Sarak캐ra 攷사kas캐la*) operated four mints in the country for the production of coins:

* Mumbai, Maharashtra
* Kolkata, West Bengal
* Hyderabad, Telangana
* Noida, Uttar Pradesh

The functions of the mint were replaced by the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India in 2006.


## History

Under The Coinage Act, 1906, the Government of India is charged with the production and supply of coins to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI places an annual indent for this purpose and the Government of India draws up the production programme for the India Government Mints on the basis of the indent.

Besides minting coins, the mints at Mumbai, Kolkata and Hyderabad also make coin blanks. Hyderabad, Mumbai and Kolkata mints have gold assaying facilities and the Mumbai mint produces standardized weights and measures. Mumbai Mint has a state-of-the-art gold refining facility up to 999.9. Hyderabad Mint has electrolytic silver refining facility up to 999.9.

Commemorative coins are made at Mumbai and Kolkata. Kolkata and Hyderabad have facilities for making medallions, too. The Noida mint was the first in the country to mint coins of stainless steel.


## Marks on mint

Each currency coin minted in India (and anywhere in the world) has a special mint mark on it to identify the mint.


### Bombay (Mumbai) Mint

Bombay (Mumbai) Mint has a diamond under the date of the coin (year of issue). The proof coins from this mint have a mint mark 'B or 'M'.


### Calcutta (Kolkata) Mint

Calcutta mint has no mark under the date of the coin (year of issue). Or it has a 'C' mark. It was unique because it had not chosen any mark because this mint is the first mint in India.

### Hyderabad Mint

Hyderabad Mint has a star under the date of the coin (year of issue). The other mint marks from Hyderabad include a split diamond and a dot in the diamond.
