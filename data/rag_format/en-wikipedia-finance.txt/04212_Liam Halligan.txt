## Career


### Economics and policy

In 1992, following graduation, Halligan joined his former university tutor Robert Skidelsky at The Social Market Foundation, the Westminster-based think tank. He later worked at the International Food Policy Research Institute and in the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, USA, as a research economist.

In 1994, Halligan joined the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics and moved to Moscow. In Moscow he shared a flat with Dominic Cummings.

Together with other economists from LSE, Oxford and Harvard, he co-founded *Russian Economic Trends*, an academic journal that published macroeconomic data, analysis and commentary on Russia. He also helped to establish the Russian-European Centre for Economic Policy, an inter-governmental policy advisory group.

Since 1997, Halligan has sat on the Policy Advisory Board of The Social Market Foundation. In 2010, he became a founder member of the Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (CAGE), an ESRC-funded research centre at the University of Warwick.

In April 2020, he called for the Government to build more social housing. In February 2021, he appeared before the Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee on quantitative easing.

In 2019, he published *Home Truths*, which argues that the UK's housing shortage deprives vulnerable families of decent social housing.

In 2020, he was shortlisted by the Government for the post of Downing Street TV Press Secretary.


### Journalism

In the early 1990s, Halligan wrote a weekly column for *The Moscow Times* and covered Russian economics and politics for *The Economist* and The Economist Intelligence Unit. He also wrote about the Soviet Union for *The Wall Street Journal* and *Euromoney*.

Halligan was a founding panellist on the daily television discussion show *CNN Talk*. He was a regular panellist on This Week, presented by Andrew Neil. When the BBC axed the programme in 2019, Halligan said the corporation had made a "blindingly obvious mistake".

Since 2004, he has also regularly presented standalone documentaries on Channel 4, including for *Dispatches*, and sits on the jury of the Royal Television Society's Specialist Journalist award.

In March 2021, Halligan was named as economics and business editor at GB News and co-presenter of a daily lunchtime show with former Labour Party MP Gloria De Piero.
