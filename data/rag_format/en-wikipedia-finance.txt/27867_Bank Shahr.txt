**Shahr Bank** is one of the private banks in Iran that officially started its operations on February 9, 2009. In the past, this bank provided financial services under the names "Honarvaran Shahr Cooperative" and "Shahr Credit Cooperative."

## History

The Shahr Credit and Financial Institution was established with authorization from the Central Bank and with shares owned by the municipalities of Tehran and other Iranian metropolitan areas. It started its official operations on February 9, 2009, with an initial capital of 1.5 trillion Iranian rials.

The main motivation behind establishing this bank was to meet municipalities' need for large-scale financing, liquidity, and capital to cover urban development costs, aiming for self-sufficiency in urban management.

After extensive efforts by senior managers of Tehran Municipality and other metropolitan areas, and with an increase in capital by shareholders to 2 trillion rials, the Central Bank, in coordination with the High Council of Money and Credit, approved the registration of Shahr Bank on February 8, 2010. The bank officially opened on March 8, 2010.

Two years after its establishment, the shareholders raised the bankâ€™s capital to 4 trillion rials to provide necessary liquidity. This amount remained until 2013, when the capital increased to 7.9 trillion rials in July. By December 2015, it had reached 15.573 trillion rials.
