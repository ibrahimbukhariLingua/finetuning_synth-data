**Taxation in Oklahoma** takes many forms. Individuals and corporations in Oklahoma are required to pay taxes or fee charges to both levels of government: state and local. Taxes are collected by the government to support the provisions of public services. The Oklahoma Constitution vested the authority to levy taxes with the Oklahoma Legislature while the Oklahoma Tax Commission is the primary Executive agency responsible for collecting taxes.

The most significant forms of taxation are income tax, sales tax and excise taxes.


## State Taxation


### Income Taxes

Taxes based on income are imposed at the State level, both on individuals and corporations. Oklahoma first enacted an individual income tax in 1915 and then a corporate income tax in 1931. Income taxes are steadily increased as a major State revenue source since 1933 when the Oklahoma Constitution was amended to prohibit State-level taxation of property.

Income taxes are now the largest source of revenue for the State government, accounting for approximately 38% of total state revenue - 32% from individuals and 6% from corporations.


#### Tax Rate


##### Individuals

Oklahoma has adopted a progressive income tax for individuals, in which the tax rate increases as the amount of personal income increase.

Individual Income Tax Rates
| Marginal Tax Rate | Single / Married Filling Separately | Married Filing Jointly / Qualifying Widow(er)s / Heads of Households |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.25% | $0 – $1,000 | $0 – $2,000 |
| 0.75% | $1,000.01 – $2,500 | $2,000.01 - $5,000 |
| 1.75% | $2,500.01 – $3,750 | $5,000.01 - $7,500 |
| 2.75% | $3,750.01 - $4,900 | $7,500.01 - $9,800 |
| 3.75% | $4,900.01 - $7,200 | $9,800.01 - $12,200 |
| 4.75% | $7,200.01 + | $12,200.01 + |


##### Corporations

The corporate income tax rate is a flat tax of 4% for all corporations, regardless of earnings. When established in 1931, the corporate income tax was progressive but became flat in 1935.


#### Revenue Purpose

Both individual and corporate income taxes are earmarked by the Oklahoma Legislature to support specific state agencies and/or funds:

Individual and Corporate Income Taxes
| Purpose | Individual-Percentage Received | Corporate-Percentage Received |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Revenue | 85.66% | 77.5% |
| Education Reform Fund | 8.34% | 16.5% |
| Teachers' Retirement Fund | 5% | 5% |
| Ad Valorem Reimbursement Fund | 1% | 1% |


### Sales and Use Tax

The State sales tax and use tax was first enacted in 1933 as a temporary one percent tax for the support of public schools. Two years later, the tax was renewed with revenues being deposited into the state General Fund. In 1939, the sales tax rate was increased to two percent with the revenues being used to fund public assistance programs. This remained unchanged until the 1980s when the revenues were redirected back to the General Fund. Additionally, throughout the 1980s, the tax rate was gradually increased from two percent to four percent. In 1990, the passage of the "Education Reform Act" increased the State sales tax rate to its present four and a half percent.

State sales taxes are now the second largest source of revenue for the State government, accounting for approximately 27% of total state revenue.


#### Tax Rate

The "Oklahoma Sales Tax Code" imposes a 4.5% Statewide tax on the sale of all goods but groceries within the State. The State also levies a 4.5% Statewide tax on the use, storage, and consumption of goods bought out of State.


#### Revenue Purpose

Both the State sales and use taxes are earmarked by the Oklahoma Legislature to support specific state agencies and/or funds:

### Gross Production Tax

The State levies a gross production tax on the removal of natural products from Oklahoma's land or water. The gross production tax was established in 1910 to tax the extraction of natural gas and oil. With the elimination of State-level property taxation, the gross production tax began an important source of State revenue. The current State gross production tax takes the form of an excise tax, with the amount of the tax based upon the sale price of oil and natural gas.

Gross Production taxes are the fourth largest source of revenue for the State government, accounting for approximately 6% of total state revenue.

Any revenues collected in excess of that amount are deposited into the Weigh Station Improvement Fund, which is used to maintain and expand the State's Weigh stations.


### Motor Fuel Taxes

In 1923, Oklahoma enacted its first State-level excise tax on motor fuels. The motor vehicle tax has since its enactment been the primary funding mechanize used for the construction and maintenance of State roads and bridges. Prior to the enactment of the fuel tax, the State played a limited role in building the State's transportation infrastructure, primarily overseeing the work conducted by local governments. The current motor fuel taxes are a set amount based upon the amount of fuel purchased and not a percentage of the sale price. The fuel taxes continue to be the State's primary source of funding for infrastructure spending, with a significant portion of the revenues being forwarded to local level government.

State motor fuel taxes account for approximately 5% of total state revenue.
