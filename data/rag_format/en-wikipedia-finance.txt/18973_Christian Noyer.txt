**Christian Noyer** (French: [nwaje]; born 6 October 1950) is a French economist who served as Governor of the Bank of France from 2003 to 2015. In this capacity, he chaired the Bank for International Settlements from 2010 until 2015. He had previously served as vice president of the European Central Bank from 1998 to 2002.


## Career

Appointed to the Treasury in the Ministry of the Economy and Finance in 1976, Noyer subsequently spent two years in Brussels from 1980 to 1982 at France's permanent representation to the European Communities. Back at the Treasury, he held a range of posts dealing with both domestic issues (government cash and debt management, banking affairs, financing of industry and state-owned enterprises) and international affairs (multilateral issues, export financing). In 1995, he became chief of staff to Finance Minister Jean Arthuis.

Noyer was appointed Governor of the Bank of France in 2003 by then-President Jacques Chirac and confirmed for a second term by his successor, Nicolas Sarkozy. During his tenure as Governor, he was also Chairman of the Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution (ACPR, the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority for banks and insurance). He also chaired the supervisory boards of the Institut d'Émission des Départements d'Outre-Mer (IEDOM) and the Institut d'Émission d'Outre-Mer (IEOM), the French overseas note-issuing central banks.


## Later career

In 2014, the daily newspaper *Le Monde* reported that Noyer had been considered to succeed Baudouin Prot as chairman of private bank BNP Paribas; the post instead went to Jean Lemierre.

In 2016, Noyer was appointed by Minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery Bruno Le Maire to lead a task force mandated with leading efforts to attract business from London in the wake of Brexit. He also led France's successful bid to relocate the European Banking Authority to Paris in 2017. In 2022, Le Maire extended Noyer's mission until 2024.

In 2018, the French Treasury asked Noyer to study all possible options to reorganize Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, part of France's fifth-biggest lender, Groupe Crédit Mutuel.
