Ngāi Tahu Holdings


# Ngāi Tahu Holdings



**Ngāi Tahu Holdings Corporation Limited** is owned by the Ngāi Tahu iwi of the South Island of the New Zealand. Its main interests are in tourism, fisheries, property and forestry and it is among the wealthiest iwi in New Zealand. Ngāi Tahu annually contributes more than $200 million to the South Island economy.


## History

Ngāi Tahu has been engaged in modern-day commercial activities since the late 1950s when the Ngāi Tahu Māori Trust Board had an annual income of about $20,000 to put toward investment and distribution through the iwi. Ngāi Tahu used the income to reinvest and grow the asset base of the tribe. From the beginning, Ngāi Tahu's fiscal policy involved reinvesting roughly two thirds of income and maintaining a tightly focused distribution policy to provide support to tribal members through education grants and scholarships.

As a result of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, Ngāi Tahu received a settlement sum of $170 million. It also subsequently involved fisheries and aquaculture assets valued at $71 million.

As a result of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Ngāi Tahu reported a $4.7 million after-tax net-loss, down from a $27.8 million net-profit the previous financial year. Over $18 million worth of value adjustments were made to investment properties owned by the group as a whole, and over $9 million worth of direct quake writedown. However, insurance claims were lodged by the group and payments are expectedᶠᵘʳᵗʰᵉʳ ᵉˣᵖˡᵃⁿᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ within the 2012 financial year.

In 2013, Ngāi Tahu received a relativity payment of $68 million from the New Zealand Government under their settlement agreement in the 1990s.

By the end of 2013, Ngāi Tahu had assets of around $1 billion, of which 56 per cent are in property, 20 per cent are in capital, 9 per cent in tourism, 7 per cent in seafood, 6 per cent in fisheries settlement and 2 per cent in other holdings.

David Kennedy, Regional General Manager for Ngāi Tahu Tourism said, *"[William and Catherine] have requested a normal Shotover Jet boat trip, which is always cautious but it's still the most exciting jetboat ride in the world.

New Zealand Labour Party MP Shane Jones said, "You need to remember that Maori trusts and iwi organisations, they're very rarely sellers. They like to hold assets for a long, long time, and given the amount of foreign ownership in the economy, it's good that tribes work together and help to buy back some of those assets that looked lost."

As the first joint-activity of the two tribes, in February 2009, Ngāi Tahu acquired 6% of Ryman Healthcare and subsequently on-sold 4.5% to Tainui; raisings its shareholding in Ryman to 8%, and establishing Tainui as a shareholder.
