Wisconsin Bell


# Wisconsin Bell



**Wisconsin Bell, Inc.** (known as **Wisconsin Telephone Co.** before 1984) is the name of the Bell Operating Company serving Wisconsin. It is owned by AT&T through AT&T Teleholdings, originally known as Ameritech.

Their headquarters is at 722 North Broadway, Milwaukee, WI. After the 1984 Bell System breakup, Wisconsin Bell became a part of Ameritech, one of the seven Regional Bell Opereting Companies.

In 1985, Wisconsin Bell began to purchase digital switching equipment from Siemens for its 1.6 million customers. In 1989, the change had been completed, and it became the first Ameritech company to use solely electronic switching equipment.

The Wisconsin Bell name continued to be used until September 1993 when Ameritech dropped all of their individual Bell Operating Company names in favor of using their corporate name for marketing purposes. Wisconsin Bell started doing business as **Ameritech Wisconsin**.

In 1998, Ameritech sold 19 Wisconsin Bell exchanges, primarily located in central and northern Wisconsin, to CenturyTel, now Lumen technologies. Those exchanges were transferred to the subsidiary CenturyTel of the Midwest-Kendall.

In 2001, following Ameritech's acquisition by SBC Corporation, Wisconsin Bell began doing business as **SBC Ameritech Wisconsin**, which was shortened in 2002 to **SBC Wisconsin**. In 2005, it adopted the trade name **AT&T Wisconsin** after SBC acquired the original AT&T Corporation and took the AT&T name. The corporate name remains Wisconsin Bell.
