List of motifs on banknotes


# List of motifs on banknotes



This is a **list of current motifs on the banknotes** of different countries and territories. The customary design of banknotes in most countries is a portrait of a notable citizen on the front (or *obverse*) and a different motif on the back (or *reverse*) - often something relating to that person. One exception to this is the euro banknotes, where non-existent architectural structures have been chosen to avoid the impression of a national bias. Even though most banknotes have more than one motif on each side, only the main motifs are described here.
