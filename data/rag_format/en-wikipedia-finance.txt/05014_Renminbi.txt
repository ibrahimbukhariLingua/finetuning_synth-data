Renminbi


# Renminbi



The **renminbi** (Chinese: 人民币; pinyin: *Rénmínbì*; lit. 'People's Currency' Chinese pronunciation: [ʐə˧˥nmi˧˥npi˥˩]; symbol: **¥**; ISO code: **CNY**; abbreviation: **RMB**), also known as the **Chinese yuan**, is the official currency of the People's Republic of China. The renminbi is issued by the People's Bank of China, the monetary authority of China. It is the world's fifth-most-traded currency as of April 2022.

The yuan (元) is the basic unit of the renminbi. One yuan is divided into 10 jiao (角), and the jiao is further subdivided into 10 fen (分). The word *yuan* is widely used to refer to the Chinese currency generally, especially in international contexts.


## Valuation

Until 2005, the value of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. As China pursued its transition from central planning to a market economy and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity. However, more recently, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012. Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the world's 8th most traded currency in 2013, 5th by 2015, but 6th in 2019.

On 1 October 2016, the renminbi became the first emerging market currency to be included in the IMF's special drawing rights basket, the basket of currencies used by the IMF as a reserve currency. Its initial weighting in the basket was 10.9%.²⁵⁹
