## Overview

Kefron AP was launched in 2013 by Kefron in Dublin, Ireland. Initially targeting local markets, the company expanded its operations and service reach to the United Kingdom, establishing partnerships and pursuing strategic acquisitions, including Lightspeed and Evolution in 2015, which contributed to Kefron’s expansion in digital storage and AP automation capabilities.
