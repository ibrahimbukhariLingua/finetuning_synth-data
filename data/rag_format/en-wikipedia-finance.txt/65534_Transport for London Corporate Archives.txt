Transport for London Corporate Archives


# Transport for London Corporate Archives



**Transport for London Corporate Archives**, formerly **Transport for London Group Archives**, is the official historical business archive for Transport for London (TfL) and its predecessor bodies. It preserves and makes available to the public documents, photographs, plans and drawings relating to the company and its predecessor bodies, such as London Transport. It is based at Endeavour Square, Stratford.


## History

London Transport did not appoint an archivist until 1992, by which time a significant volume of records had accumulated in the vaults under the organisation's former headquarters at 55 Broadway since the opening of the first Victorian underground lines in the 1860s. With the formation of TfL in 2000, the corporate archives became the responsibility of TfL Corporate Archives and Records Management department.

* London Transport (in its various incarnations from 1933–2000)
