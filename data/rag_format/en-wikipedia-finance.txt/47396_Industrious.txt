## History

Industrious was founded in 2012 by Jamie Hodari and Justin Stewart, two best friends who grew up next door to each other in Michigan, who complained of the low quality of shared office spaces.

In August 2019, the company raised $80 million in Series D funding from Brookfield Property Partners, Canada Pension Plan, TF Cornerstone, Granite Properties, and Equinox Group. In February 2021, CBRE Group invested $200 million and contributed its 10 coworking locations under the brand Hana to Industrious in exchange for a 35% stake in Industrious. In May 2022, CBRE invested an additional $100 million in Industrious.
