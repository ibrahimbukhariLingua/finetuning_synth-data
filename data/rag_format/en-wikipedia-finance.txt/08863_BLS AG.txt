BLS AG


# BLS AG



**BLS AG** is a Swiss railway company created by the 2006 merger of BLS Lötschbergbahn and Regionalverkehr Mittelland AG. Its ownership is divided, with 55.8% of it owned by the canton of Berne, and 21.7% by the Swiss Confederation. It has two main business fields: passenger traffic and infrastructure.

BLS has a subsidiary—**BLS Cargo**—which is responsible for all freight operations. BLS Cargo works in cooperation with the freight subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, Railion. However, the staff, apart from management and sales, is employed by BLS AG. Part of the BLS locomotive fleet is owned by BLS Cargo.

Another subsidiary, **BLS Fernverkehr AG**, is responsible for long-distance passenger transport. BLS Fernverkehr AG is wholly owned by BLS AG.


## Infrastructure

In 2007 the new, 34.6-kilometre-long (21.5 mi) Lötschberg Base Tunnel opened, which is part of the 449 km of infrastructure owned and operated by BLS AG. The Lötschberg base tunnel was built by a wholly owned subsidiary, **BLS AlpTransit AG**. By mid-2007 this company handed over the base tunnel to BLS AG. In 2009 this company was renamed **BLS Netz AG** and the entire BLS infrastructure passed over to this company which is mainly owned by the Swiss Confederation, which has paid for most of the recent investments.

* Bern–Neuchâtel railway line
