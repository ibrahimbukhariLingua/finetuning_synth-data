Polish Economy Hall of Fame


# Polish Economy Hall of Fame



The membership in the **Polish Economy Hall of Fame** (Polish: *Galeria Chwały Polskiej Ekonomii*) is an award for Polish economists.


## Idea

In 2005 the Polish edition of German business magazine *Manager Magazin* established *Galeria Chwały Polskiej Ekonomii* (translated: *Hall of Fame of the Polish economy*), which is similar to a business and economic hall of fame, established by *Manager Magazin* in Germany in 1970. Since 2010 the business magazine *Strategie* endows the award. By becoming a member in *Galeria Chwały* once a year an outstanding Polish economist is awarded for lifetime achievements for the Polish economy.

Since 2012 the Association of Finance Directors in Poland FINEXA (Stowarzyszenie Dyrektorów Finansowych Finexa) is organizer of the award. The ceremony is held at the annual congress of the organization in Warsaw. The new organizer established an enlarged jury.
