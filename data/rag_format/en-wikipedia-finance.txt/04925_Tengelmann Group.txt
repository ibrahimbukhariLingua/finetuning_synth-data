## History


### Founding (1840s-1887)

In the mid-19th century, Johann Wilhelm Meininghaus (1790-1869) established the colonial goods store Joh. Wilh. Meininghaus Sohn in the Villa Artis, located in the inner city park “Ruhranlage” in Mülheim an der Ruhr. On January 1, 1847, a 15-year-old named Wilhelm Schmitz began his commercial apprenticeship there, which later led to his professional career. Due to his abilities, he took over the company’s management, now known as Wilh. Schmitz & Lindgens, alongside Ludwig Lindgens (1827-1910) in 1857. Lindgens, who was primarily a financial partner and had already established the Lindgens leather factory with his wife in 1861, retired from the business at the end of 1866. To distinguish himself from the numerous Schmitz families in Rhineland, Schmitz added his wife Louise’s maiden name to his own, and Wilhelm Schmitz-Scholl oHG was founded on January 1, 1867. Louise Schmitz-Scholl became the first woman in Germany to have signing authority. In the early 1880s, Schmitz began roasting coffee and eventually opened a large roasting plant in 1882.


### Domestic Expansion (1887-1972)

Following Wilhelm Schmitz’s death in 1887, his sons Wilhelm Jr. and Karl assumed control of the company. The brothers established their own retail outlets for their products. Their authorized representative, Emil Tengelmann, whose name inspired the company Hamburger Kaffee-Import-Gesellschaft Emil Tengelmann, founded in 1893, assisted them in expanding the business. The first branch for coffee, tea, and cocoa opened in Düsseldorf. Due to its tremendous success, an additional 560 branches were established throughout Germany by the onset of World War I.

In 1906, the first proprietary production company, the Rheinische Zuckerwarenfabrik, was established in Düsseldorf. In 1912, the Wissoll cocoa and chocolate factory (Wilhelm Schmitz-Scholl) was added in Speldorf, where the group’s headquarters were located until the property was sold to the Viennese real estate developer Soravia. The relocation to Munich occurred in the fall of 2021.

During the 1920s, additional production facilities were established, including factories for grain and malt coffee, pudding powder, cookies, and nutritional products. The number of branches increased again to 540 by 1927, the year Wilhelm Jr. passed away. After the death of Karl Schmitz-Scholl senior in 1933, the company was inherited by his two children Elisabeth Haub and Karl-Erivan Schmitz-Scholl, who became the sole managing director. During the Nazi era, Schmitz-Scholl was a supporter and member of the NSDAP and the SS (Hauptsturmführer). Tengelmann also produced special food for the Wehrmacht. Since 2011, Lutz Niethammer’s team has been analyzing, using biographical, corporate strategy, and cultural studies approaches, whether and to what extent the company was involved in forced labor, Aryanization, occupation rule, and war profits. The SS membership of the then boss Karl Schmidt-Scholl Jr. and his conduct between the company, family, SS, and Wehrmacht were also investigated.

Following the company’s reconstruction after World War II, the first Tengelmann self-service store was opened in Munich in 1953. In its anniversary year of 1967/68, the company operated over 400 stores, with sales exceeding the billion mark for the first time. In 1969, Erivan Haub, son of Elisabeth Haub, became the sole managing partner of Schmitz-Scholl/Tengelmann in accordance with the articles of association. In 1971, the company took over its competitor Kaiser’s Kaffee Geschäft AG in Viersen.


### International Expansion (1972-2000)

In 1972, Tengelmann founded the brand discounter Plus as a second mainstay. Tengelmann has owned the Plus brand since 1911. Subsequently, Tengelmann acquired stakes in companies around the world or took over a majority shareholding, such as in The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (New Jersey) in 1979, or A&P for short. In 1984, the company acquired a majority stake in Hermans Groep in the Netherlands and rebranded its supermarkets and hypermarkets as A&P in 1994. The Dutch business was sold again in 2000.

At the end of the 1980s, Tengelmann expanded its portfolio with the textile and consumer goods discounter Rudis Reste Rampe. In 1997, the decision was made to concentrate on the food business and all 156 stores were sold to the Berlin-based Wand-&-Boden Group. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, the company also expanded into the former Eastern Bloc by opening Plus stores in Hungary and Poland. In 1990, Tengelmann took over the Modea textile chain. This was followed seven years later by a management buy-out and the renaming of the company to Takko ModeMarkt GmbH & Co. KG. Today, the company operates under the name Takko Holding GmbH. The Tengelmann Group is no longer involved.


### Consolidation (2000- )

In 2000, Erivan Haub handed over the operational business to his sons Karl-Erivan Haub and Christian W. E. Haub. The 111 department stores of Grosso and Magnet were sold, 66 of them to Lidl & Schwarz. In the same year, the first OBI store was opened in the People’s Republic of China in Wuxi. Tengelmann-Warenhandelsgesellschaft has been a limited partnership since 2002. On June 30, 2003, Wilh. Schmitz-Scholl Schokoladen- und Zuckerwaren GmbH (Wissoll) was taken over by the Dortmund-based confectionery manufacturer van Netten GmbH. van Netten filed for insolvency on October 18, 2012; after an unsuccessful search for an investor, liquidation followed in June 2013. In April 2005, the Chinese Obi stores were sold to the British DIY chain Kingfisher. On May 1, 2005, Tengelmann sold the 307 stores of the drugstore chain kd kaiser’s drugstore GmbH to Rossmann GmbH. In the same year, the Hungarian and Slovenian Interfruct Cash & Carry stores and the Canadian subsidiary of the A&P Tea Company were also sold.

In 2007, A&P took over the American supermarket chain Pathmark with 141 stores. In the same year, the Spanish Plus stores were sold to the French retailer Carrefour and the stores in Poland and Portugal were sold to the Portuguese retail chain Jerónimo Martins.

On January 1, 2009, Plus merged with Netto Marken-Discount, part of the Edeka group; Edeka holds an 85 percent majority stake in the newly founded company. Plus and Netto together now achieve sales figures similar to the industry leaders Lidl and Aldi. The Plus stores were rebranded as Netto by mid-2010. In 2008, the Czech Plus stores were sold to Rewe Group, the Hungarian stores to Spar Austria and the Greek stores to the Belgian retail chain Delhaize Group. On February 19, 2010, the Bulgarian and Romanian Plus stores were sold to the discounter Lidl. The Austrian branches of the Plus brand, which are operated as Zielpunkt, were sold to the German-Luxembourgish financial investor BluO.

In 2010, Woolworth Germany was acquired, but these shares were sold in 2012. The Tengelmann supermarkets in the Rhine-Main region were sold to Rewe and Tegut.

The sale of the Tengelmann stores to Edeka initially failed in August 2015 due to antitrust concerns.
In March 2016, the Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel finally approved the sale to Edeka with a ministerial authorization.
At the end of October 2016, Sigmar Gabriel and Verdi boss Frank Bsirske announced the agreement between the bosses of Edeka and Rewe, Markus Mosa and Alain Caparros.

In December 2020, Tengelmann acquired all shares in Kik in exchange for the TEDi shares.

In July 2022, the Obi business in Russia with 27 stores at the time was sold to the Russian financial and real estate investor MAX for a symbolic purchase price.
