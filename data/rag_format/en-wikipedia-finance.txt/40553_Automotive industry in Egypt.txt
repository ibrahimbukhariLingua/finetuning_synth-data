Automotive industry in Egypt


# Automotive industry in Egypt

 

The **automotive industry in Egypt** has been developing for 50 years. It can sell more than 200,000 vehicles annually and is now the second-largest market in Africa and the 42nd largest in the world, with an annual production output of over 70,000 vehicles. After experiencing many failures and success, the Egyptian Automotive industry is focusing more on assembly operations rather than manufacturing.


## Evolution of the automotive industry


### 1960s

The automotive industry in Egypt started in 1961, when the Egypt government founded the first automobile company called EI Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company. It was the first Arab vehicle manufacturer and it was state-owned. The company mainly produced Fiat-based vehicles due to engineering and design problems and the company also assembled foreign licensed cars under its brand. After years of development, they came up with their own products, such as Nasr 128 GLS, which was the best-selling model at that time.


### The Open-Door Policy

In 1974, President Sadat of Egypt initiated an Open Door Economic Policy (ODEP). Many foreign companies and capital entered the Egyptian automotive market in the 1980s. In 1985, General Motors (GM) started a joint venture with Al-Mansour Automotive Company which was a local importer and car dealer in Egypt. At the beginning of the 1990s, the Egyptian government adopted the Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP), which attracted many foreign companies which entered the Egyptian market to build their factories and assembly lines. There were many big companies such as Citroen, Fiat, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, BMW and so on.


### January 25 revolution

In 2010, vehicle production peaked at 116,683. It was the best year performance-wise for the Egyptian automotive industry. However, the Egyptian revolution of 2011, also known as the January 25 revolution, which deposed former president Hosni Mubarak, caused significant harm to the industry. Nissan suspended its production in Egypt for safety reasons after anti-government protests started, Toyota stopped their SUV assembly line in Egypt due to the situation, many Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai Motors had to give up their business in Egypt due to the country-wide protests and many employees were forced to return to Korea or a different country, BMW returned German nationals to Germany because of the violent demonstrations, and other automotive manufacturers like Daimler AG and General Motors had temporarily suspended operations in Egypt. Due to the political changes, the production rate went down 30% in 2011 and remained down for the next few years. The total car production in 2017 was only 36,640.


## Domestic automotive industry

The automotive industry is one of the most important industries in Egypt and brings many benefits for the economy. In the 1980s, EI Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company was the only giant manufacturer in the entire Egyptian market. There are now 83 car manufacturers in Egypt. It has giants like GM, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota and Nissan, which produce some of their vehicles in Egyptian factories. There are more than 15 car assembly plants and 75 facilities in the country providing more than 75,000 job opportunities. Egypt has the capacity to produce 300,000 passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses per year. It is an under-penetrated automobile market with large numbers of the young population. The demand is increasing every year and has big potential. Only an average of 35 Egyptians out of 1000 own a car. The number in Algeria, for reference, is 130 out of 1000 which is about four times larger than Egypt.

However, the Egyptian pound's recent devaluation caused a negative impact for imports of cars and their parts. It made the assembly components more expensive and caused a substantial impact on the vehicles' selling price and the cost of production and assembly. It is difficult for domestic producers to compete with European exporters and large-scale Asian manufacturers due to the small market. At the end, the existing assemblers will look for companies that have high sale volumes in the country.

The Egypt government has signed the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement which allows free trade in 26 countries of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(COMESA). It provides opportunities for Egyptian exports. The economy of Africa is increasing and the car demand is booming across the board.

## Egypt automotive market

The Egyptian automotive market is now focusing on the customer experience and provides many opportunities for some parts. Geographical diversification model is one of the most important strategies for automobile manufacturers to stay competitive and profitable. All the giant companies in Egypt are focusing on self driving technology. The government encourages the development of the automotive industry. However, it is expensive to invest in environmental pollution regulation.


### Production

As a country with over 100 million people, the production, which only averages less than 10,000 per year is unable to keep up with the demand. The production in South Africa is ten times larger than in Egypt and the production in Morocco is five times larger than in Egypt. In 2002, the total number of the production of cars in Egypt was 45,073. In 2010, sales increased to 116,683, which was the best year in Egyptian automotive production. However, due to political changes (January 25 revolution), the production went down 30% in 2011. The total production as of 2017 is only 36,640. But the government has strong confidence to boost the car industry in 2018. And the market has given its feedback which the total production number of vehicles go up 90%.

Chevrolet sold 21,468 cars, which was a 34.7% decrease in its sales compared to 2016 which saw the sales of 32,890 cars.
