## History

Wilson Sonsini was founded in 1961 as **McCloskey, Wilson & Mosher** in Palo Alto, California, with attorneys Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey Jr., John Arnot Wilson, and Roger Laurence Mosher as the name partners. Wilson was a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School's class of 1941, which included Supreme Court jurists Byron White and Potter Stewart as well as former President Gerald Ford. The firm since launch has primarily been focused on the representation of emerging technology companies and venture capitalists.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Lawrence W.

In late 1998, the firm opened its first national office, in Kirkland, Washington, led by partner Patrick Schultheis.
