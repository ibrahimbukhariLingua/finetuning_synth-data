## History

Böhler-Uddeholm was listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange between 10 April 1995 and 5 September 2008. In April 2007, voestalpine AG made a takeover offer for Böhler-Uddeholm - the bid was accepted by a majority of shareholders in June of that year. voestalpine completed a squeeze out of Böhler-Uddeholm's remaining shareholders in September 2008 to gain complete control. The former Böhler-Uddeholm divisions "Precision Strip" and "Welding Consumables" were transferred to other divisions within the voestalpine group. The remaining "High Performance Metals" "Forging" divisions were merged and became the fifth division, "Special Steel", of voestalpine AG.
