## Disputes

In November 2019, tenants of 63 Wall Street and 67 Wall Street in Manhattan filed a class-action lawsuit against Rockpoint over alleged rent-regulation violations. Rockpoint was alleged to have failed to follow the 421-g program which allowed it to forgo property taxes but required it to offer rent-regulated leases. Rockpoint was considered to have overcharged above the lease limits while still benefiting from tax breaks. In September 2020, Rockpoint reached a settlement where it would pay out $5 million to 4,800 current and former tenants.
