The Office of the State Treasurer also provides certain services to South Carolina residents, including its college and ABLE savings programs.

Aside from their functional responsibilities, the state treasurer is a member of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority (SFAA), an independent agency which also includes the governor, the comptroller general, and the chairs of the budget committees in the General Assembly. The SFAA is generally charged with oversight of state spending and management of state property.
