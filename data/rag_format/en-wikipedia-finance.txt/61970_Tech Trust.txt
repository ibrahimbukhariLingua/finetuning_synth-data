## History

Peter Sweatman founded Tech Trust (known then as Charity Technology Trust) to bring together key players in the charity, business and technology sectors. Among the initial supporters of Charity Technology Trust (CTT) were Charles Dunstone, Peter Wheeler, Lord Joel Joffe, Tessa Baring and Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington.

The charity’s first initiative was CTT Raffles, which provided online raffling technology to UK charities. The CTT Raffles platform was supported by James Redhead, and offered a tailored online raffling engine, along with data capture, collation and processing of entries and marketing support. It launched in May 2001 with the support of Oxfam, Guide Dogs for the Blind, Barnardo's, PDSA and the National Trust.

In 2003, the charity branched out into e-communications, offering a charity email service that allowed leading charities to make a number of email marketing campaigns throughout the year. In 2008, they partnered with dotmailer to offer a new, low-cost email marketing system to charities and not-for-profits. The service was known as CTTMail, but has since been rebranded to *tt-mail*.

In 2006, Charity Technology Trust joined the global software donation programme run by TechSoup to deliver Microsoft’s donation programme in the UK. The scheme is open to all UK registered charities, who pay an administration fee, usually of between 4 and 8 per cent of retail price. CTT was already providing Cisco donated products through an online shop on its CTXchange website (now *tt-exchange*). Since then, the programme has expanded to include a number of different digital technology partners.

In October 2013, Charity Technology Trust (CTT) changed its name to Technology Trust. In October 2017, the name was changed again to Tech Trust. The registered charity name and company name has remained the same.

The last Chief Executive, Richard Craig, stepped down in January 2018. The current Chair is Charles Mindenhall.


## Awards

In August 2012, the charity was shortlisted for two Charity Times Awards. Their partnership with Microsoft was selected for the Corporate National Partnership Champion category, and the partnership between CTT, SCIE (Social Care Institute for Excellence) and Lasa on the Get Connected project has also been recognised, with the project being named as one of six finalists in the Cross-Sector Partnership of the Year category.
