## Career

Weldon worked at Skadden, Arps and McKinsey & Company, both in New York City.

Weldon has served as the CEO of NZX Limited (NZX). When Weldon took over NZX, it was a mutual organisation that had nearly been sold to the ASX for a peppercorn. He led the exchange through a demutualization and a listing, leading the organisation for a ten-year period, from 2002 to 2012.

Weldon has given a significant amount of time to public policy in New Zealand. Service includes:

* leading the Prime Minister's Appeal for Christchurch, after the 22 February 2011 earthquake
* chairing the Prime Minister's Job Summit in 2009

He was previously on the Board of the New Zealand Olympic Committee (2004–2006).

After leaving NZX Weldon invested in the wine industry, buying vineyards on Felton Road, Bannockburn, and establishing the Terra Sancta winery. Terra Sancta was named in the Top 100 Wineries of the World by Wines & Spirits Magazine in 2015.

In 2014, Weldon was appointed as the CEO of MediaWorks New Zealand, managing the company's radio, television and digital businesses. Weldon resigned in May 2016 amidst media controversy over his management decisions and a line of high-profile resignations, saying "the personal cost is now too high to continue in this role".

Weldon has since invested in a number of private companies.
