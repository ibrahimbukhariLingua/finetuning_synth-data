# Fuji Electric



**Fuji Electric Co., Ltd.** (富士電機株式会社, *Fuji Denki Kabushiki-gaisha*), operating under the brand name **FE**, is a Japanese electrical equipment company, manufacturing pressure transmitters, flowmeters, gas analyzers, controllers, inverters, pumps, generators, ICs, motors, and power equipment.


## History

Fuji Electric was established in 1923 as a capital and technology tie-up between Furukawa Electric, a spinoff from Furukawa zaibatsu company, and Siemens AG. The name "Fuji" is derived from Furukawa's "Fu" and Siemens' "Ji", since German pronunciation of Siemens is written *jiimensu* in Japanese romanization. The characters used to write Mount Fuji were used as ateji.

In 1935, Fuji Electric spun off the telephone department as Fuji Tsushinki (lit. Fuji Communications Equipment, now Fujitsu).
