## References to Hong Kong culture

* The film is a satirical reflection of the materialistic nature of modern Hong Kong society.
* Drinking games are popular in Hong Kong. About 15 minutes into the film they play a drinking game called 'Millionaire'. For this, everyone has to perform one of three gestures and each person takes turns to call them out. If both people are doing the same gesture, the person calling wins and the other drinks. Tony Leung and Shu Qi play another game a little while after called 'Liar'.
