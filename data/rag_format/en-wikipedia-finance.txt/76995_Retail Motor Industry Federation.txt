## Component associations


### National Franchised Dealers Association

The RMI National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA) represents the welfare and interests of franchised dealers within the passenger car and commercial vehicle sectors.

Within the membership structure, there are national and regional committees, representing small to medium dealers, truck dealers, and the largest groups in the industry.

Held quarterly, these meetings give franchised dealers the chance to exchange views and discuss common issues, and enable the NFDA to reflect local, as well as national, issues when lobbying Government departments and representing themselves through the media.

The NFDA is pursuing campaigns to re-establish new car profitability, gain lower list prices, protect members’ investment and enhance dealer viability.

In May 2013, the NFDA took a majority ownership stake in Trusteddealers.co.uk to give the organisation a consumer-facing presence.


### Motorcycle Retailers Association

The RMI Motorcycle Retailers Association (MRA) is the only organisation that represents exclusively the welfare and interests of retailers of motorcycles, related accessories and services.

An executive committee, comprising members from various regions, enables it to reflect local, as well as national, issues when lobbying Government or representing the industry through the media.

The main aims of the MRA are to provide more influence, better information and stronger support to the motorcycle retail sector to improve profitability, protect members’ investment and to enhance retailer viability.

The MRA has liaison with motorcycle manufacturers and importers, equipment and component suppliers and service providers. It also represents member interests with other organisations such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), the Department for Transport (DFT), VOSA, the European Commission, Trading Standards, Inland Revenue, media and consumer associations.

It is a member of the National Motorcycle Council and the Motorcycle Theft Action Group.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Petrol Retailers Association (PRA)

The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) represents independent fuel retailers who now account for 65% of all UK forecourts and provides a voice for all retailers both large and small. They are committed to supporting members to develop all aspects of their activities by offering information, services and advice which ensures that the independent fuel retailing sector can continue to grow and be competitive in an ever more challenging business environment.

This also requires the PRA to challenge and work with all appropriate Government departments to ensure that the sustainability of independent forecourt retailers is properly considered. Their key objective is to ensure that membership provides real, quantifiable value that outweighs the annual subscription fee and that the benefits they offer are of interest across the spectrum of their membership.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### National Association of Motor Auctions

The RMI National Association of Motor Auctions (NAMA) represents auction companies of all sizes selling cars, commercial vehicles and off-road vehicles.

Established in 1969, NAMA represents a broad mix of membership from the smaller family businesses to the larger national companies.

NAMA only accepts into membership financially viable companies which can provide evidence of sound and accepted trading practice. The NAMA acts as a pressure group on behalf of the vehicle auction industry in general, and as a supplier of specialist services and advice to individual auction companies. It alerts customers to the benefits of buying or selling through NAMA members who must adhere to NAMA's Code of Practice and Customer Charter.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Independent Garage Association

The RMI Independent Garage Association (IGA) provides UK and European influence, quality standards, support services and technical information for those involved in the service, repair, sale and MOT testing of motor vehicles.

The IGA provides assistance and guidance to the independent garage sector.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation (RMI) represents its members in Europe through membership of CECRA (the European Council for Motor Trades and Repairs) and CITA (International Motor Vehicle Inspection Committee), ensuring that European law does not have a detrimental effect on independent garages.

As a result of negotiation between the RMI and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), independent operators have the right to service vehicles within manufacturer and extended warranties; and the RMI continues to campaign on the subject of access to technical information and training relevant to the maintenance of newer vehicles.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### National Body Repair Association

The RMI National Body Repair Association (NBRA) policy is formulated by a National Consultative Group consisting of some of the country's leading accident repair specialists.

The aim of the NBRA is to assist members in addressing issues and work for positive change in the industry, to help their businesses survive and thrive.

For example: one of the major ongoing projects is the revision of the Bodyshop Quality Control (QC) Standard. The existing Standard has been a success but, as vehicle technology has moved on, the new Standard needs to be even more attractive to work providers.

The NBRA's objectives are to confront unfair practices; to assist in the creation of conditions that enable industry sectors to prosper; to raise industry standards; to train and ensure adequate human resources; and to provide one voice for all bodyshops through unity with the Vehicle Builders and Repairers Association (VBRA Commercial).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Cherished Numbers Dealers Association

The RMI Cherished Numbers Dealers Association (CNDA) was established in 1971 to represent dealers of personalised and attractive registration numbers, and to protect the interests of their customers.

Personalised and attractive number plates have become a growth industry, with thousands of motorists now displaying registrations which perhaps represent their initials or advertise their business or profession. Others choose a number which bears an amusing message.

Members of the CNDA adhere to a strict code of conduct, and each member is regularly monitored by the Association to ensure that, for instance, transfers are complete within an acceptable time limit.

Although the transfer of a registration number to the new owner can be done by direct application to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), the process of finding a suitable registration, and then ensuring that all legal requirements are complied with, can be complex and time-consuming. A dealer with CNDA membership can handle the process.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
