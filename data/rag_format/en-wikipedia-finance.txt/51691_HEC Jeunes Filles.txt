**Haut Enseignement Commercial pour les jeunes filles**, also called **HEC jeunes filles**, was named after HEC, the most famous French business school. HECJF is a state recognized degree in France.
The diploma allowed to teach economics and management in grammar schools and granted credits to become a chartered accountant.


## History

* In 1916, when Louli Sanua created the school, dedicated to young women, she selected students among those who passed the baccalauréat (French national secondary-school diploma, required to study at university).
* In 1924, Louli Sanua sold the school to the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCIP). The CCIP already owned the "École supérieure de commerce de Paris", ESCP, established in 1819, and the "École des Hautes études commerciales", HEC, established in 1881.
 Coeducation did not exist, neither at HEC, nor at ESCP. The Direction of HEC had refused to admit girls.
 In the same year (March 25th), the decree Bérard allowed girls to pass a baccalauréat which was equivalent to that of the boys.
* In 1954, a preparatory course after the baccalauréat became compulsory to apply for the competitive examination to HECJF. Year after year, as competition strengthened, two years were more often necessary for entry to the 3-year programme at HECJF.
* In the early 70's, the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry decided to introduce coeducation to all of its schools and to close HECJF.
* Since 1973, HEC Paris, ESCP, EAP, and also ESSEC (École supérieure des sciences économiques et commerciales) have been accepting women.
