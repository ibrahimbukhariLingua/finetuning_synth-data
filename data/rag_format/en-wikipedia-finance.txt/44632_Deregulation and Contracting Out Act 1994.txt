Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994


# Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994



The **Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994** (c. 40) is an Act of Parliament. It introduced wide-ranging measures with aims including reducing burdens on people in trade created by previous acts such as the Shops Act 1950, changes in transport legislation, changes in utility legislation, and changes in financial services, among others.

It also contained so called Henry VIII clauses, which meant ministers could amend previous primary legislation through order (i.e. drafted by the Secretary of State without a vote in Parliament).

The Act was largely repealed and replaced by the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Part II of the Act, which as of July 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ remains in force, includes a general power to outsource "any function of a Minister or office-holder" if the minister "by order so provides".
