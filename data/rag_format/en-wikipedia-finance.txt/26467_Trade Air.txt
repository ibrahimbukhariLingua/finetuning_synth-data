# Trade Air



**Trade Air d.o.o.** is a Croatian passenger and cargo charter airline headquartered in Zagreb and based at Zagreb Airport. The company is registered as an airline whose main activities are passenger charter flights and cargo operations, organised either on charter chain flights or *ad hoc* flights. Trade Air also specialises in the transportation of dangerous goods.


## History

Trade Air was established in April 1994 and started operations on 22 May 1995. It is a private company fully owned by Mihajlo Cvijin.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2004, the airline added two Fokker 100 aircraft to their fleet and started to use them to operate charter flights for passengers in March 2005. In November 2007, Trade Air operated flights with their Fokker 100 aircraft in Australia, transporting journalists as one of two dedicated carriers for the Australian federal elections.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Between November 2004 and February 2005, Trade Air based one of its Let 410s in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in a short-lived and ultimately failed attempt to operate flights between Mostar and Zagreb under the *Bosnia Airlines* brand.

In March 2007, the airline was anonymously accused of allegedly overloading their aircraft with cargo and having pilots who allegedly flew every consecutive day for two or three weeks without taking a minimum 36-hour rest period within any seven consecutive days. Legislators dismissed the anonymous accusations.

In May 2008, the airline received IOSA certification.

Until June 2010, Trade Air operated scheduled flights between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Sarajevo with two Let L-410 Turbolet aircraft besides other charter flights for either cargo or passengers. In the summer of 2013, Trade Air started scheduled operations supported by the Croatian Ministry for Sea Transport and Infrastructure between Osijek and Zagreb. This was the first time this route was served after 26 years. In May 2016, Trade Air started operating scheduled flights for Croatia Airlines from Zagreb to Athens, Barcelona, Brussels, Copenhagen, Dubrovnik, and Lisbon.

In February 2017, Trade Air secured a contract with Swiss travel agency *PowdAir* to operate winter ski-charter flights to several destinations from Sion Airport from winter 2017. In 2018, Trade Air secured an ongoing contract with Israeli company Israir Airlines for flights from Tel Aviv to destinations in Europe.

In September 2024, Trade Air retired the Airbus A319 aircraft registration number 9A-BTJ that flew under the My Wings airline name.
