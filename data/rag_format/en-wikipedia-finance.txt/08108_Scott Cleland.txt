Cleland is known for being the first in change research and the only investment research firm that accurately predicted WorldCom's demise and bankruptcy when WorldCom was the most recommended stock in the marketplace.

### Investor protection advocacy

In 2002, Cleland conceived and was the founding chairman of Investorside, the first association of independent research firms serving investors and the first US financial services association to require a code of ethics for certification and membership. As Chairman of Investorside, Cleland was the first analyst to testify to Congress on how conflicts of interest caused Enron's, WorldCom's, and other record bankruptcies. Congress looked to Investorside's testimony to explain how banking conflicts of interest harmed investors before the record WorldCom bankruptcy triggered the passage of the seminal Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which protects investors from audit and accounting fraud and financial conflicts of interest. Cleland also contributed to investor protection as the lead source to the PBS Frontline Emmy-winning documentary “*The Wall Street Fix*” for his insights into the industry's conflicts of interest.

In 2007, Cleland, in Senate congressional testimony, warned Congress and antitrust officials that the Google DoubleClick merger would create a monopoly. In 2010, Cleland, in House congressional testimony, warned Congress and antitrust officials again that other BigTech Internet platforms would become monopolies as well. In 2011, Cleland authored *Search & Destroy: Why You Can't Trust Google Inc.,* which was translated into Portuguese and Korean. The book was selected as one of the top 20 most important cyber-law and information policy books of the year by Adam Thierer of the Technology Liberation Front. Cleland founded and led the Restore Us Institute, a non-profit internet accountability research and education think tank.
