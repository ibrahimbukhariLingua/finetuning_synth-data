## Notable events

In 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation into a transnational fraud scheme affecting U.S. citizens which involved posing as legitimate technology and antivirus companies to steal money from them. The fund was then transferred to bank accounts controlled by Prithvi Bahadur Shah in Nepal. Nepal Rastra Bank received a request from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to confiscate and return the money. The Bank withheld the money and directed it to the Department of Money Laundering Investigation for further Investigation.
Finance Minister Janardan Sharma who was accused of being closely associated with Shah applied pressure on Nepal Rastra Bank to release the funds which Adhikari refused to fulfill. Amidst the disagreement, Cabinet suspended Adhikari from the post in a charge of leaking sensitive information of the Government. Adhikari went to Supreme Court of Nepal and the court gave an interim order to reinstate him after which he resumed his office.

In July 2022, CPN-UML, the main opposition party in the Nepalese parliament, revealed its central committee members, including a name M Adhikari in the Finance and Planning committee. This led to speculations and criticism on social media, linking him to Governor Adhikari. Adhikari requested the CPN-UML to correct the misinformation, denying any connection to M Adhikari. The party later clarified that the listed M Adhikari is not the NRB Governor, Maha Prasad Adhikari.
