***Inflation Blues*** is an album by Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition recorded in September 1982 and released on ECM the following year. The ensemble features reed players Chico Freeman and John Purcell, trumpeter Baikida Carroll, and bassist Rufus Reid.


## Reception

The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow states, "this is a particularly strong outing by the 1982 edition of the group... it is not surprising that the music is adventurous yet quite coherent, with the solo and group statements being both spontaneous and logical. Recommended."
