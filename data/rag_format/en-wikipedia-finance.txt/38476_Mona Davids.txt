**Mona Davids** is an American activist who is the founder and president of the New York Charter Parents Association and the New York City Parents Union.


## Early life and education

Davids was born in South Africa and raised in Brooklyn, New York.


## Business career


### Dutch companies

Early in her career, Davids worked for the Dutch companies Schiphol USA Inc. and MeesPierson Investment Bank.


### Azania

Davids co-founded, along with Eric Steinhilber, Azania Holdings International Inc., a firm that promoted trade and investment between the United States and African countries. Taking its name from the historical geographic region Azania, the firm identifies itself as a "Black Economic Empowerment Company" registered both in the U.S. and South Africa. Azania also describes itself as "a business development and communications consulting firm based in New York" providing business consulting services that include: business development, strategic investment counseling, communications & marketing services, project management, branding and web development.

As an officer of Azania, Davids reportedly organized investment conferences in partnership with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and other banks, and sponsored trade and networking events in New York City. In 2007 Brooklyn Goes Global Director Steve Kaplansky praised Azania for facilitating the creation of a memorandum of understanding between the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture that would create "mutually beneficial" relationships between business leaders and decision makers of the two groups. She also "conducted country briefings and trainings for U.S. executives leading Fortune 500 companies stationed in South Africa."

During the early period of her education advocacy, Davids was sometimes described as being on leave from Azania. In September 2010, she spoke at a conference as head of Azania. In September 2014, as CEO of Azania, Davids gave a talk opening the International South Africa ICT & Telecom Tactical Investment Forum in New York City. At the event, Elizabeth Daly, Director of the Division for International Business of the Office of the Mayor of the City of New York, "offered words of support from the Bloomberg administration to the attendees and applauded Azania Holdings International Inc. for bridging the gap and facilitating partnerships between New York City based and South African companies."


## Education advocacy

Davids "became involved in education advocacy while on maternity leave in 2008," serving as co-president of the PTA at her daughter's school, according to the website of the New York City Parents Union.

A November 3, 2009, article described Davids as a "Bronx parent who went from charter school foe to cheerleader in under a year." In 2008, it was reported, Davids had been co-president of the parent association of P.S. 160 in the Bronx, where she led the opposition against a new charter school, Equality Charter School, which was set to be located in the same building. After leading protests against the school, however, Davids "sent in her daughter's application to the charter school and began helping the charter recruit other students." She later explained she had been misinformed about how big the charter school would be, and that "A lot of parents are just opposed to charter schools in general, and that's because most parents don't know exactly what a charter school is."


### New York Charter Parents Association

After her daughter was accepted into the charter school, Davids founded the New York Charter Parents Association in April 2009. Davids later stated that she founded the group after her daughter began attending a charter school and Davids "learned that charters are not required to have PTA's."

A May 5, 2009, article in the *New York Post* reported that Davids, who two months earlier had been fighting against charter schools, was now "leading the charge in the opposite direction — as the founder of the first citywide parent association for charter schools."

A November 3, 2009, article noted that Davids was popping up "everywhere from charter school board meetings and charter renewal hearings to district Community Education Council gatherings," and that she had been "featured in a television advertisement for Mayor Michael Bloomberg's reelection campaign, in which she blasted rival William Thompson's education record."

Although describing herself as "a supporter of charter schools," she claimed that there were "serious issues" with the schools, for example that "the charter system doesn't have district family advocates." According to Davids, she was "on leave from her job as head of the consulting firm Azania Holdings" at the time and was funding her Parent Association efforts herself and with help from an anonymous philanthropist, whose donation to the group would be used to provide a stipend for six parents active in the group. Several P.S. 160 parents who opposed Equality Charter Schools "said they still feel betrayed by her for switching sides in that debate." It was also noted that "Davids' involvement in other charter school siting battles, notably at P.S. 15 and PAVE Academy in Red Hook, has garnered much attention, some of it extremely critical."

With the founding of the New York Charter Parents Association, Davids became the leader of an effort to make certain changes in New York State Education Law and the Charter Schools Act. For example, she "fought to require public schools receive matching funds to renovate their space when co-located with a charter school." Changes passed in 2010 as a result of Davids' activism include: requiring charter schools to accept a certain number of students with special needs and who speak English as a second language, requiring charter schools to form PTAs or Parents Associations, requiring New York City's Department of Education "to provide matching renovation funds to district schools that are co-located with a charter school," and requiring that "every district and charter school co-located in a public school building have a shared-space committee consisting of a parent and teacher from the charter school and other schools in the building." Another change Davids advocated for was the denial to the New York City Department of Education of the authority to authorize new charter schools.

Davids has been a plaintiff in many lawsuits involving schools. In December 2010, for example, she and several co-plaintiffs sued the New York State Education Commissioner and the City of New York for granting a waiver that enabled Cathie Black to become Chancellor of the New York City Public School System.


### New York City Parents Union

In May 2011, Davids formed the New York City Parents Union. At the time of its formation, she sued the New York City Department of Education, charging it with having "botched" Community Education Council elections. The next month, the New York City Parents Union joined with the group Class Size Matters in a lawsuit against New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, asserting that his failure to charge charter schools a certain level of rent represented a violation of the Charter Schools Act and Education Law. In February 2013, Davids and other members of the New York City Parents Union sued Governor Andrew Cuomo in connection with the failure of the United Federation of Teachers and Mayor Bloomberg to come to an agreement about teacher evaluation.

In November 2013, the New York City Parents Union joined with Public Advocate Tish James and Class Size Matters in a lawsuit against Mayor Michael Bloomberg in response to his co-location of various district and charter schools. The next month, Davids was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the New York State Department of Education involving the disclosure of student and parent data. In February 2014, Davids and the New York City Parents Union sued Governor Cuomo and the State of New York in a fiscal matter.

The *New York Post* noted on November 10, 2011, that despite its self-identification as an independent group, the New York City Parents Union had "already received $10,000" from the United Federation of Teachers, and that it would host "its first annual awards benefit" that evening at UFT headquarters, at which honorees would include UFT President Michael Mulgrew, NAACP head Hazel Dukes, and Arthur Z. Schwartz, identified by the *Post* as "a longtime labor lawyer who represented the transit union during its unlawful 2005 strike, which crippled the city." Schwartz's offices, like those of the New York City Parents Union, are at 225 Broadway, Suite 1902, in New York City.

As of August 2015ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the group was not listed on GuideStar, CharitiesNYC.org, or the New York State Attorney General's website of state nonprofits, so further membership and funding totals are not available according to City Limits, though Davids said the group claimed 9,000 members, and countered "We are not listed on any charity, we are grassroots. We are not affiliated with anybody or the charter lobby or education reformers, or teachers, or the teacher unions that they support".


### Protea Group

Davids has been president of The Protea Group Inc. since May 2012. The Protea Group describes itself as "a communications and public affairs consultancy based in New York City...that provides a full suite of services including community relations, strategic advice, issue advocacy, grassroots organizing, public affairs, website development, political management, social media marketing, investment forums and trade missions." The group's website focuses on such services as issue advocacy and the building of political campaign websites.
