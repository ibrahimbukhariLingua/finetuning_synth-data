R. K. Cho Economics Prize


# R. K. Cho Economics Prize



The **R. K. Cho Economics Prize** is awarded by Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea to academics in the field of economics who have contributed to the development of scholarship and education. As of 2018, the prize includes a plaque, a medal, and a monetary award of â‚©100 million.


## History

The prize was established in 2007 with an endowment from R. K. Cho, the president of Samryoong Co. (KRX: 014970) and an alumnus of Yonsei University's economics department. Cho was motivated to create the award after seeing the results of his prior humanities-focused donations to Yonsei University, and hoped the prize could help to connect students of his alma mater and famous South Korean economists overseas. Originally awarded only to South Korean citizens, in 2015 the prize was opened to foreign scholars as well. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no recipient was selected in 2021, and the award ceremony for the twelfth recipient (Valerie Ramey in 2020) was delayed until September 2022 when it could be held jointly with the ceremony for the thirteenth recipient (Yuriy Gorodnichenko).

R. K. Cho died in January 2024.
