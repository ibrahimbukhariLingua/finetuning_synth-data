## Research interests

In his research, Meynhardt combines psychological and business management topics:

* Public value (or Gemeinwohl): Meynhardt developed the St. Gallen Public Value approach in keeping with the intellectual tradition of Peter Drucker and the St. Gallen Management Model and based on the work by Hans Ulrich and Walter Krieg. The societal wealth creation of an organization is captured conceptually and examined empirically by means of philosophical value, psychological, and sociological theories. Meynhardt thus attempts to answer management’s question regarding the public value contribution of businesses, public authorities, and non-governmental organizations. Under his guidance, the Public Value Atlas of Switzerland (GemeinwohlAtlas) was developed, which transparently represents the contribution to the common good of the largest Swiss companies and organizations from the population’s point of view. After 2014, 2015 and 2017, the fourth Public Value Atlas Switzerland was published in September 2019. As for Germany, such a Public Value Atlas was published in 2015 and May 2019. On 1 October 2020 the Public Value Atlas was published for the first time on a local level for Leipzig.
* Competency management: His interest focuses on the analysis and assessment of individual competencies and their link to organizations’ core competencies.
* Leipzig Leadership Model: Being a member of the core team of HHL - Leipzig Graduate School of Management, he developed the Leipzig Leadership Model, which was published in 2016, along with Manfred Kirchgeorg, Andreas Pinkwart, Andreas Suchanek and Henning Zülch. As for the Leipzig Leadership Model, the contribution to the common good (public value) is characterized as a purpose, which is oriented towards a social benefit, serving as a motivating and legitimising function. Thus, public value becomes a resource of good leadership. According to the Leipzig formula, a purpose always requires a reference to the common good.

## Diagnostic tools

To date, Meynhardt has developed three social science diagnostic methods:

* “Value Knowledge Guide” (WertwissensGuide): Based on Peter Orlik’s “self-concept grid”, which follows in the tradition of George A. Kelly’s repertory grid, Meynhardt has developed a grid variant to analyze value knowledge in organizations.
* “My Competency Profile”: With this internet-based diagnostic method, Meynhardt developed an innovative method for the survey and automated analysis of basic competencies. The conceptual reference point is the work of John Erpenbeck and Volker Heyse.
* „Public Value Scorecard” (in collaboration with Peter Gomez): This tool transforms Meynhardt’s public value theory into a scorecard. The five available variations can be adapted to manifold corporate development issues.
