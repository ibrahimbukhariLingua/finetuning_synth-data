## History


### 1910–1926

EML is a combination of three associations which are formed in the early 20th century.

Master Bakers Association is a prospered bread company which established in 1881. On the celebration of the third anniversary of the formation of this company, managers of this company started to realise the importance of workers' rights and living standard. Great Southern Bakeries is one of the large baking business in the early 20th century in Australia. After realising that the requirement of providing compensation to workers who get injured while working, Great Southern Bakeries and the Master Bakers Association set up the Master Baker's Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd, which was registered in Sydney, New South Wales as a limited company in 1910. According to EML (2019), with five employees, the Master Bakers Association provides compensation services to workers in baking, plumbing and transport industries in New South Wales at that time. This organisation established the first compensation act which affects the state at that time. In 1911, the Master Bakers' Mutual Indemnity Association Ltd guaranteed to protect workers' right by assisting individuals to against claim and demands in respect of accidents to workers

This concept of insurance and compensation gradually separated into other industries at that time.
