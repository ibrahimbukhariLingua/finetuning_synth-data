**Quicksilver** is a British amusement arcade and gambling machine company. It is the UK's largest slot gambling machine operator, with over 200 high street outlets and about 10,000 gambling machines. Quicksilver describes itself as the "largest amusement business in the UK".


## Operations

In conjunction with their parent company, Talarius, they operate three high street brands across the UK, Quicksilver, Silvers and Winners, including eight at motorway service areas.

In 2007, the profitability of the firm was hit when the British government introduced a new taxation regime for gambling and a smoking ban on commercial premises but the company has since recovered.

Since 2012, Quicksilver have run the arcades at all Extra motorway service stations in the UK, and from 2013, the arcade at the Folkestone service station on the M20.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
