DCMS helps warehouses to remove the risk of stock pile-up, stock-outs, pending orders and loss of sales due to customer dissatisfaction. It dramatically improves warehouse productivity, helps strengthen customer relationships, reduces operating expenses, and increases warehouse and distribution efficiencies. Due to its modular design, DCMS can be easily customized for various clients as per their requirements. WMS is an intelligent investment that will instantly boost accuracy in the warehouse operations and yields long term financial benefits.


## ERP systems

Contemporary inventory management strategies such as JIT (Just In Time), ECR (Efficient Customer Response), and QR (Quick Response) demonstrate potential applications for DCMS. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems can be replaced by DCMS due to its functionality fit, knowledge base, frequent updates, integration, and adaptive capacities.
