## History

**Paramount Equity Mortgage**, founded in 2003 by Hayes Barnard, Jason Walker and Matt Dawson. The company was incorporated in California to provide residential mortgage loans. Although they launched in California's Sacramento Valley, the company lends nationwide.

In 2006, the founders launched an insurance company focused on auto and home insurance. After over ten years offering insurance services, the company sold its insurance company to Brown and Brown.ʸᵉᵃʳⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2017, Paramount began originating residential solar loans and later rebranded as Loanpal.

In 2019, Loanpal announced a partnership with PenFed Credit Union. In 2019, Loanpal was responsible for 30% of all new residential loans in the U.S.

In June 2020, Goldman Sachs securitized $459 million worth of Loanpal loans they had previously purchased and expanded their warehouse facility to $300 million with Loanpal. Goldman Sachs also committed to buying $320 million in loans from Loanpal. By October 2020, the company had funded over $4.5 billion in solar loans and closed a securitization of $434 million worth of Loanpal loans in November 2020 and was responsible for 41% of the solar loan market in the U.S. and was the top solar lender in the country.
