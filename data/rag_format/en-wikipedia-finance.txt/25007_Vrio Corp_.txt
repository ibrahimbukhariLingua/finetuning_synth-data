# Vrio Corp.



**Vrio Corp.** (formerly **DirecTV Latin America LLC**; stylized as **Vгio**) is an American company that manages the commercial operations of the Latin American branch of DirecTV (mostly known as DirecTV Latin America). It is owned by Grupo Werthein. It produces TV content, and owns several TV channels.

As of 2018, DirecTV Latin America's legal name was changed to Vrio Corp.


## History

In 1994, Hughes Electronics Corporation and Venezuelan media company Grupo Cisneros create a joint venture named Galaxy Latin America, a company intended to distribute DirecTV services in 27 Latin American countries, initially with an offer of 144 channels. In that same year, it enters the Chilean market and then it was launched in Mexico.

In 2000, Galaxy Latin America LLC was renamed as DirecTV Latin America LLC.

In 2005, Grupo Cisneros sold its 14% stake on DirecTV Latin America to The DirecTV Group Inc.
While in Mexico and Brazil it merged with rival Sky and disappeared, in South America it absorbed Sky as the latter struggled in the market.

On January 17, 2016, the Secretary of Environment of Bogotá, sanctioned DirecTV's Colombian subsidiary, Directv Colombia Ltda., with a sum of $118 million for placing advertisement without the proper permission from the city. The company violated Decree 959, published in 2000, that regulates where companies can place public publicity.

On September 15, 2017, Reuters reported that AT&T, the owner of DirecTV's U.S. and Latin American divisions, had hired an advisor to consider offering DirecTV Latin America on the public stock market. The principal motive was cited as the need to reduce the debt load AT&T would assume if it took over Time Warner as planned. Since that date, the U.S. Dept. of Justice filed suit to block that acquisition on antitrust grounds, a trial is scheduled to start on 19 March 2018 before Judge Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and a decision is not expected before June–July. However, even if the deal is blocked, AT&T might dispose of the division as not core to its business. On April 19, 2018, the IPO was cancelled.

On May 19, 2020, the company ceased operations in Venezuela, due to US sanctions against pro-Maduro TV channels Globovisión and PDVSA TV in 2019. These channels require mandatory transmission imposed by the telecommunications commission of Venezuela, CONATEL, while the US sanctions simultaneously block the transmission of these channels.

On July 21, 2021, AT&T Latin America announced that they will sell Vrio to Grupo Werthein, which will include all DirecTV operations in Latin America and SKY Brasil (while keeping the broadband operations in Colombia and their stake at Sky México). The sale was completed on November 16, 2021.
