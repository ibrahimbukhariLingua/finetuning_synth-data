# Trifacta



**Trifacta** is a privately owned software company headquartered in San Francisco with offices in Bangalore, Boston, Berlin and London. The company was founded in October 2012 and primarily develops data wrangling software for data exploration and self-service data preparation on cloud and on-premises data platforms.

Its platform, also named Trifacta, is "designed for analysts to explore, transform, and enrich raw data into clean and structured formats." Trifacta utilizes techniques in machine learning, data visualization, human-computer interaction, and parallel processing so non-technical users can work with large datasets.


## History

The company was developed from a joint research project with Ph.D. and UC Berkeley Professor Joe Hellerstein, Ph.D. and University of Washington and former Stanford professor Jeffrey Heer, and Stanford Ph.D. Sean Kandel. The company created a software application that combines visual interaction with intelligent inference for the process of data transformation and was launched in October 2012; to date, Trifacta has raised over $76 million in funding from Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Ignition Partners and Cathay Innovation. The company also has investments from X/Seed Capital, Data Collective and angel investors Dave Goldberg, Venky Harinarayan and Anand Rajaraman.
