International Accounting Education Standards Board


# International Accounting Education Standards Board



The **International Accounting Education Standards Board** (IAESB) was an independent organisation within the fold of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The board developed guidance to improve standards of education in accountancy. It ended its term of service in 2019.

The board made significant contributions to international accountancy education and the global accountancy profession by developing high-quality, relevant International Education Standards and by harnessing stakeholder relations to understand future needs. In 2018, the IAESB and IFAC agreed on a new path forward that shifted the responsibility for the International Education Standards and guiding accountancy education into the future to IFAC, working in close partnership with its 180 member organizations, Network Partners and Forum of Firms stakeholders.
