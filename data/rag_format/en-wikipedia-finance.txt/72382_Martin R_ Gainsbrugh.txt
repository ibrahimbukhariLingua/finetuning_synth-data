## Work


### *High-Level Consumption*, 1935

The first detailed estimates of aggregate consumer expenditures for goods and services in the United States over a period of time appeared in William H. Lough with the assistance of Martin Gainsbrugh, *High-Level Consumption*, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1935. These pioneer estimates covered the years 1909, 1914, 1919, 1921, 1923, 1925, 1927, 1929, and 1931. The data for the later years were revised and extended by Harold Barger, *Outlay and Income in the United States, 1921–1938*, National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1942. In the 1940s, J. Frederic Dewhurst and Associates (*America's Needs and Resources*, 1947) revised these various estimates and expanded those on recreational expense to take account of estimates by Julius Weinberger, "The Economic Aspects of Recreation", *Harvard Business Review*, summer issue, 1937.

In 1935, estimates of aggregate consumer expenditures in detail for 1909 and 1929 and selected years between were prepared by Martin Gainsbrugh and published in William H. Lough, *HighLevel Consumption*... This book included a comparison with The Brookings Institution's aggregates for 1929, showing that the two estimates were very close for food expense, and reasonably close for attire and home maintenance; but the estimates by Lough and Gainsbrugh of expenditures for all other items were much higher than the Brookings' figures.
