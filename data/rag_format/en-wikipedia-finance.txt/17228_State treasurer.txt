In the state and territorial governments of the United States, 54 of the 56 states and territories have the executive position of **treasurer**. New York abolished the office of New York State Treasurer in 1926, in which the duties were transferred to the New York State Comptroller. Texas abolished the position of Texas State Treasurer in 1996, transferring the duties of that office to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.

The state treasurer serves as the chief custodian of each state's treasury and as the state's head banker. Typically, they receive and deposit state monies, manages investments, and keeps track of budget surpluses and deficits. The position has powers and responsibilities similar to those of the United States Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States, or the chief financial officer of a corporation.
