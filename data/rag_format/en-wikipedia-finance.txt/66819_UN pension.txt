UN pension


# UN pension



**UN pension** is a retirement benefit provided to people who have worked directly for the United Nations organization. It is provided through the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF) under Article 28 of the Regulations, Rules and
Pension Adjustment System of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF Rules).


## Eligibility

A UN pension is payable to a participant whose age on separation is the normal retirement age or more and whose contributory service was five years or longer.


## Countries where UN pension is tax-free

Unlike the UN salaries, the UN pension to former officials or to their survivors is not exempt from national income taxation. Applied tax rate depends exclusively on national legislation. Most of the countries tax the pension, but many grant exemptions for the lump sum pension payment.

Countries which grant tax exemption for the UN pensions whether it is paid as a lump sum or as a monthly income are the following:

| America | Asia | Europe | Oceania |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Argentina | Bahrain | Austria | Fiji |
| 2 | Belize | India | Malta (\*) | New Zealand (1) |
| 3 | Cayman Islands (\*) | Kuwait | Monaco (\*) | Samoa |
| 4 | Chile | Malaysia |
| 5 | Colombia (1) | Oman |
| 6 | Costa Rica | Philippines |
| 7 | Dom. Republic | Qatar |
| 8 | Ecuador | Singapore |
| 9 | Honduras | Saudi Arabia |
| 10 | Jamaica | Taiwan |
| 11 | Mexico | Thailand |
| 12 | Panama | UAE |
| 13 | Peru |
| 14 | Uruguay |
| 15 | Venezuela |

(\*) Countries that require an investment in real state or a high-balance bank Account.

However, a different rule may apply to lump sum pension.

The UN Join Staff Pension Fund does not maintain official information on national tax legislation since beneficiaries reside in over 180 countries. However, the Office of Legal Affairs of the United Nations has created a Tax Guide. The guide was prepared in 2010 and has not been updated since.
