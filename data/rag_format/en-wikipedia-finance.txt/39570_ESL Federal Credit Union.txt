## History

ESL Federal Credit Union was chartered in 1920 as Eastman Savings and Loan Association by George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak Company. Eastmanâ€™s intent was to provide his employees with a financial institution that served their financial needs by providing savings accounts and mortgages.

On February 1, 1996, Eastman Savings and Loan changed its charter from a U.S. bank to a Federal Credit Union, changing its name to ESL Federal Credit Union. It is the largest locally owned financial institution in the Greater Rochester area and the second largest credit union in New York State. ESL is in the top 1% of national credit unions ranked by assets.
