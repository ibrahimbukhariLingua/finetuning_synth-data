## History

Alarm.com was founded in 2000 as part of MicroStrategy's research and development unit and launched an interactive security program that enabled remote monitoring and arming for a disarmed security system in 2002. The company has developed its platform to include smart home and business software that incorporates video monitoring, energy management and a range of home automation capabilities. In February 2009, Alarm.com was acquired by venture capital firm ABS Capital Partners for $27.7 million. In 2015, Alarm.com filed for an initial public offering and went public that June.

Alarm.com offers a cloud-based platform for smart home and business operating systems. The platform enables subscribers to secure and monitor their properties via web-based and mobile applications, as well as through integrations with Apple TV, Amazon FireTV, Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The company began offering energy management in early 2010, allowing users to remotely control heating and cooling on their property using mobile apps or via the company's website.

Alarm.com reported revenues of $167.3 million and a user base of more than 2.3 million subscribers in 2014. In 2018, the company reported revenue of $291.1 million.

In 2015, Alarm.com issued an IPO at $14 a share. ABS Capital Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures, which invested $136 million in the company, remained the majority shareholders.

In 2016, Alarm.com integrated its cloud-based connected home platform with Amazon's Echo wireless speaker and voice-command devices, as well as the HomeKit-compatible Apple TV.

In 2020, Alarm.com acquired Shooter Detection Systems for an undisclosed sum.
