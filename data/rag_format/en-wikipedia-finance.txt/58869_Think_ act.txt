Think: act


# Think: act



***think: act*** is a publication title created by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants. Since 2004, various kinds of publications for international leaders have been collected under the brand *think: act*. Among these are magazines, information brochures and books.


## *think: act* – the magazine

*think: act* was first published in December 2004. The magazine addresses decision makers in companies and is thus clearly focussed on B2B-relations. Three to four times each year, the magazine is published in English, German, Russian, Chinese and Polish. The 20,000 copies of each edition are sent to leading managers in 22 nations. The concept of the magazine is to address current management issues, as its aim is to achieve and maintain "thought leadership".

It is the aim of this publication to keep a high journalistic standard and to move Roland Berger as a brand into the background.

In the *Handbuch Unternehmenskommunikation* (Handbook of corporate communication), *think: act* is listed as a reference for B2B customer-magazines.

In 2005, 2006 and 2007, the magazine *think: act* was awarded the Best of Corporate Publishing (BCP) Award in the business area of "financial services / real estate / consulting". Recently, the magazine won the Mercury Award 2009 (Silver) as well as the Astrid Award 2010 (Honors) in the category "Executive Magazine".
