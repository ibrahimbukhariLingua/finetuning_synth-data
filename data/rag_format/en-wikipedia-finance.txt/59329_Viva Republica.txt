## History

Toss was launched in 2014 as a peer-to-peer money transfer platform by the former dentist Lee Seung-gun after eight failed ventures. Over time, more and more new services were offered on the platform, including loans, credit scores and personal investing.

Altos Ventures was the first investor in 2014. Later PayPal, Sequoia China and the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC also invested in the start-up.

In 2018, the company became a unicorn after raising $80 million in a funding round led by Kleiner Perkins and Ribbit Capital.

In 2020, Toss was launched in Vietnam, its first overseas expansion.

In October 2020, Toss launched Toss Bank, a neobank.

In June 2021, Viva Republica raised a further $410 million in a funding. Investors included Alkeon Capital and the Korea Development Bank.

In November 2021, Viva Republica announced the acquisition of a majority stake in VCNC, which operates a ride-hailing service called Tada.
