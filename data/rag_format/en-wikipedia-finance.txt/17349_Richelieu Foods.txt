## History

The company was founded in 1862. By 1956, the company operated as Western Dressing Inc. It was sold to an investment group in 1988. The group had the company expand its line of products. In 1994, Richelieu focused on the contract packing and private label areas. The Western Dressing brand was sold and eventually acquired by Unilever with Richelieu Foods packing the dressing until Unilever took it in-house eight years later, marketing it under the Wish Bone brand. In 2003, a Connecticut private equity firm, Brynwood Partners, purchased the company.

In 2006, the company was named *Pizza Manufacturer of the Year* by *Snack Food and Wholesale Bakery* magazine. On August 30, 2008, the company acquired the "Sauces and Dressings" division of Sara Lee Foodservice along with the Sara Lee manufacturing facility located in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. In 2010, the company was purchased by Centerview Partners, a private equity firm then by Freiberger USA in 2017.
