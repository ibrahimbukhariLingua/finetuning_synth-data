## History

Grenergy was founded in Spain by economist David Ruiz de Andrés. It started its first projects in Spain (2008-2012) with solar farms in the provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, Sevilla, Granada and Ávila. The company chose Chile for its Latin American expansion, which began in 2014, after incentives for the sector were curbed in Spain.

In 2016, it was awarded the construction and development of two wind farms in Cajamarca (Peru), and continued with the construction of two solar plants in Colombia and Mexico.

It began operating in Italy, and the United Kingdom in 2020, and began operating in Germany in 2022. It entered the United States by acquiring a 40% stake in Sofos Harbert Renewable Energy, a photovoltaic and battery project developer. A year later, it succeeded in acquiring 100% of the company, which has been renamed Grenergy US.


### IPO

In 2015, the company began trading on the Mercado Alternativo Bursátil (MAB - now known as BME Growth) of the Spanish Stock Exchange. In 2019, it made the jump to the continuous market. In 2021, the company registered its first green bond program, a debt issuance aligned with the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2021 and the Loan Market Association's (LMA) Green Loan Principles 2021. The company signed the first green financing linked to sustainability in Spain with Banco Santander in 2023.
