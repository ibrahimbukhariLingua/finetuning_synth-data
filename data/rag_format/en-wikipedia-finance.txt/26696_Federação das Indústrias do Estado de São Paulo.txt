## History

During the 1924 Revolution led by general Isidoro Dias Lopes, the president of the São Paulo Commercial Association (ACSP), José Carlos de Macedo Soares, remained in São Paulo, which was being bombarded to protect the working-class neighborhoods, factories and shops. When the resistance was defeated, Macedo Soares was accused of cooperating with the revolution and was exiled. As a result, the ACSP became weaker without its president.

In 1928, a group of business owners from the São Paulo Trade Association led by Jorge Street, Francisco Matarazzo and Roberto Simonsen founded the Center of Industries of the State of São Paulo (CIESP), a private association that supports and represents industries interests. In 1931, Matarazzo, Simonsen, Street and a group of business owners founded the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) to claim back the industries’ competitiveness in Brazil and to reduce production costs and contain the deindustrialization.

During the government of Getulio Vargas, CIESP and FIESP remained separate. After World War II, both entities returned to work together.

## Recent campaigns

FIESP led the campaign for approval of the General Law of Micro and Small Enterprises and the free movement of Goods and Services on wheat flour derivatives in 2006, which led to a price reduction of items like bread and pasta in 2006.

In October 2007, FIESP sent a letter to Brazilian business owners that listed the reasons why the Provisional Contribution on the Movement or Transmission of Values, Credits and Financial Nature CPMF should be extinguished. FIESP sent more than 1.3 million signatures against the CPMF to the Constitution and Justice Committee (CCJ) of the Federal Senate of Brazil.

In December of that year, the federal senator designated the end of CPMF's taxes.

Since 2008, the FIESP claimed a tax exemption on basic food products. In 2013, the federal government approved a provisional measure that reduced the Social Integration Program (PIS), Contribution to Social Security Financing (COFINS) and eliminated the industrialized products taxes on basic food products (IPI).

FIESP has also campaigned for public banks to reduce, by 30%, the rate of banking spread in 2009.

In 2011, FIESP initiated the campaign 'Energy at the right price', and presented in the Audit of the Union Court requesting the government to take action regarding the country's electricity prices. The federal government then granted all Brazilians the average discount of 20% in electricity costs in 2013.

In April 2013, the FIESP campaigned in the Chamber of Deputies for the approval of the Provisory Measure (MP) 595, known as the Port Law, which improves infrastructure and privatizes ports in Brazil.

The Port Law was sanctioned by President Dilma Rousseff in June of that same year.

The Special Institution of the São Paulo Court of Justice suspended the property tax increase in December of that year.

In June 2014, FIESP completed a partnership with the Center for Information and Coordination of Dot BR (NIC.br) and developed a software for fixed broadband monitoring. This free software confirms if internet connections comply with the contracted services.

In September 2015, FIESP started a campaign called Não Vou Pagar o Pato, against the increase in taxes and against the return of the CPMF. The CPMF was presented by the Dilma Rousseff government as the best way to recover the economy, shaken by the 2014 economic crisis. Later, FIESP started to use the duck as a symbol of the campaign for the impeachment process of the president in a context of political crisis, added to the economic crisis.
