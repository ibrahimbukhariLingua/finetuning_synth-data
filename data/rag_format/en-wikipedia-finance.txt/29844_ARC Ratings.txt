## History

In 1988, Companhia Portuguesa de Rating, S.A. was founded in Portugal, focusing on domestic assignments.

In 2013, the company was renamed ARC Ratings, and a number of credit rating agencies joined forces into the new consortium:

* Credit Analysis and Research Limited from India (Asia), the second largest credit rating agency in India
* Global Credit Rating Company Limited from South Africa (Africa), the largest credit rating agency in Africa
* Malaysian Rating Corporation Berhad from Malaysia (Asia)
* SR Rating Group from Brazil (South America)

In 2015, ARC Ratings moved from being a consortium to a main shareholder structure, and claims to compete as a rating agency globally against the Big Three credit rating agencies.
