Energy Identification Code


# Energy Identification Code



The **Energy Identification Code** (**EIC**) is a 16-character identifier (code) used in Europe to uniquely identify market participants and energy resources (entities and objects) related to the electricity and gas sector.

EIC codes are used for:

* Transmission System Operators, Market Participants such as traders, producers, consumers, power exchanges, grid operators, suppliers, agents, service providers, etc.
* Local grids where metering points are situated, Market Balance Areas consisting of several local grids, Control Areas, Bidding Zones, etc.
* The physical lines that connect adjacent market (balance) areas or internal lines within an area, including Transmission lines.
* Metering points
* Physical or logical places where an identified object or the IT system of an identified object is or could be located.
* Any object that generates or consumes energy, including Substations, Generation units and Power plants.

The EIC codes are used — among others — in platforms that support EU regulations on transparency and integrity:

* ENTSO-E Transparency Platform for electricity
* ENTSO-G Transparency Platform for gas
* ARIS platform

## Actors involved in the EIC coding scheme

The scheme is supported by a central issuing office (CIO), which function is exercised by the ENTSO-E Secretariat for both the electricity and gas sectors, and ENTSO-E-authorised Local Issuing Offices (LIOs) in Europe.
As of 2024-12-17, there are 62 LIOs

EIC consists of 16 characters structured as follows:

* 2 digits: LIO id
* 1 letter: resource type as per the table below.
* 12 chars: LIO-specific identifier, padded on the right with dashes
* 1 char: checksum

EIC types (see EIC Definitions for more details):

| type | name |
| --- | --- |
| A | Substation |
| T | Tieline |
| V | Location |
| W | Resource Object |
| X | Party |
| Y | Area or Domain |
| Z | Measurement point |

On 2021-12-16, IANA registered the **urn:eic** URN namespace, so now EIC can be used in making semantic triples of Common Information Model (electricity) data or other energy Linked Open Data.
