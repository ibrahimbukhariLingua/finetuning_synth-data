Taxation (magazine)


# Taxation (magazine)



***Taxation*** is an English-language weekly magazine for professional UK tax advisors. It is owned by LexisNexis, part of RELX. The magazine is edited in the LexisNexis Sutton office. The first issue was published on 1 October 1927 and it has been in continuous publication ever since. The masthead declares that the magazine has been 'since 1927 the leading authority on tax law, practice and administration'. It is published on Thursdays.


## Contents

Each issue of *Taxation* usually contains about 25 pages of editorial, in addition to display and recruitment advertising and a directory of service providers. The editorial content is written by contributors and by a small in-house team with a background in the tax profession. Typical contents include:

* **Comment article** – expressing the view of the contributor about a particular technical tax issue, typically calling for a change in the law or in HM Revenue & Customs practice.
* **Update** – news of changes in tax and comment on them from industry spokespeople, plus concise coverage of recent tax cases.
* **Feature articles** – normally three main articles, around 2000 – 3000 words each, examining a particular tax issue in technical detail. Occasionally there are interviews with leading figures in the tax industry.
* **Meeting points** – concise reports of practical tax issues taken from presentations at conferences and seminars.
* **Feedback** – correspondence from readers.
* **Readers' Forum** – technical tax questions sent in by readers, which are then answered three issues later by other readers.
