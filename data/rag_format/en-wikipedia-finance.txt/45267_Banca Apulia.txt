The bank experienced a significant growth from the 1980s to 2006 under the CEO Tommaso Gozzetti who received an honorary degree from Foggia University for it. The foundations were laid for the bank's regional growth, which in 1985 took the name Banca della Capitanata S.p.A. In 1996, the bank acquired Banca Agricola Salentina, grew in size and changed its name again to BancApulia S.p.A. with its registered office in San Severo; this change was also reflected in the logo, which became Castel del Monte.
