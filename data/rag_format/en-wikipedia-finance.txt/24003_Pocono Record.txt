# Pocono Record



The ***Pocono Record*** is a daily newspaper published in print and online in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, United States.


## History

The *Pocono Record* was founded as the *Stroudsburg Daily Times* on April 2, 1894.

In 1946 the newspaper was purchased by James H. Ottaway Sr., becoming the third newspaper in what would become the Ottaway Community Newspapers chain, which was purchased by Dow Jones and Company in the 1980s. Dow Jones was eventually purchased by News Corp. Today, the *Pocono Record* is a subsidiary of Local Media Group.

On September 4, 2013, News Corp announced that it would sell the Dow Jones Local Media Group to Newcastle Investment Corp.—an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group, for $87 million. The newspapers will be operated by GateHouse Media, a newspaper group owned by Fortress, News Corp. CEO and former *Wall Street Journal* editor Robert James Thomson indicated that the newspapers were "not strategically consistent with the emerging portfolio" of the company. GateHouse in turn filed prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 27, 2013, to restructure its debt obligations in order to accommodate the acquisition.

Officially, the article "The" is not part of the newspaper's name.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Market

The *Pocono Record* is the newspaper of record for Monroe County, Pennsylvania. Its coverage area centers on Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg and includes the area's many small communities. The newspaper also covers parts of Pike, Lackawanna, Wayne and Carbon counties as well as areas of western New Jersey.

Monroe County is one of Pennsylvania's fastest-growing counties, giving the *Pocono Record* tremendous growth opportunities. However, this is a challenge for the newspaper because much of the population commutes to New York City or New Jersey and feels little connection to Monroe County - and therefore lacks the motivation to read the community newspaper.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Because of this, the *Pocono Record* lacks any direct local competitors but competes against newspapers such as the *New York Post* and *New York Daily News*. In addition, the *Pocono Record* competes with regional publications such as the Wilkes-Barre *Times-Leader*, *Scranton Times-Tribune* and the Allentown *Morning Call*.


## Online publications
