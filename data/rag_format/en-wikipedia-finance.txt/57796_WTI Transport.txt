Owner-Operators can partner with WTI to grow their business with loads offered through McLeod's LoadMaster software.

## History

WTI was founded in 1989 under the name Welborn Transportation by owners, Stephen Rumsey and Miller Welborn whose fleet of 12 flatbed owner operators hauled freight throughout the Southeast.
In December 1997, Boyd Bros. Transportation merged with Welborn Transportation and later changed the Welborn name to WTI Transport, Inc.

On November 14, 2013, Daseke, of Addison, Texas merged with Boyd Bros.Transportation bringing WTI into the family of Daseke companies. With this merger, Daseke became ranked in the Top Five Open-deck/specialty carriers in North America. Following the 2013 Boyd merger, Daseke acquired Lone Star Transportation, a Fort Worth Texas company, Bull Dog HiWay Express of Charleston, South Carolina and Hornady Transportation, of Monroeville, Alabama. These mergers placed Daseke Inc. as North America’s second largest Flatbed Specialty carrier in terms of tractors and revenue.

On December 22, 2016 Daseke announced its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp II and on February 28, 2017 became a publicly traded company on Nasdaq under the tickers DSKE and DSKEW.

Daseke through its family of companies: WTI Transport, Boyd Brothers, Boyd Logistics, Mid-Seven Transportation, Smokey Point Distributing, E.W. Wylie, J. Grady Randolph, Central Oregon Truck Company, Lone Star Transportation, Bull Dog HiWay Express and Hornady Transportation, controls an aggregate fleet of more than 3,000 tractors and 6,000 flatbed/specialized trailers which serve 49 U.S. states as well as Canada and Mexico.

In April 2024, Daseke was acquired by TFI International for $1.1 billion.
