Build to rent


# Build to rent



**Build to rent** is a term for purpose built, institutionally owned and professionally managed residential property that is let on the open market rather than sold.


## Growth in the UK market

In October 2016, it was estimated that only some 8,000 units had been built with a further 15,000 units under construction. To date, the majority of completed projects have come forward in London and the major provincial cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield. Construction is now underway in Birmingham and Leeds. The UK Government is reportedly encouraging the sector's growth.

By September 2019 the number of units either built or in construction was reported to have increased to 35,000 following large developments by a number of firms report in the media.

Build-to-rent is the most contemporary development in the private rented sector (PRS) and offers housing across the full spectrum of privately rented accommodation in terms of scale and service offering, often with affordable housing being integrated through discounted market rental homes.


### Criticism

Tenants in BTR properties typically pay an 11% premium over other properties in similar locations, according to one study.


## Innovation

Build-to-rent developments are incorporating modern technologies and sustainable practices, such as energy-efficient systems and water conservation. One such example includes the integration of Tesla electric vehicles in some projects, like those by PropiCloud, which represent an innovative approach to enhancing urban living sustainably.
