## History

The Serbia Broadband company – SBB – was formed in 2002 through the merger of KDS d.o.o Kragujevac, Telefonija Belgrade cable system, Media Plus Novi Sad, YU VOD Nis and a number of small operators.

In 2007, Serbia Broadband was acquired by Mid Europa Partners, which simultaneously purchased Telemach Slovenia followed by acquiring Telemach Bosnia and Herzegovina shortly afterwards, cable television and broadband internet providers in Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, respectively. Mid Europa then created United Group, a subsidiary to control its three new acquisitions in former Yugoslavia, with European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) holding a minority stake in the newly created subsidiary. In the case of Serbia Broadband, the owners legally controlled it via the Amsterdam-based Adria Cable B.V.

In October 2013, an American private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) purchased the majority stake in United Group from Mid Europa Partners for an enterprise valuation of 1.3 billion USD, thus gaining control of Serbia Broadband. Once the new owners took over, they began legally controlling Serbia Broadband through the Amsterdam-based Adria Serbia Holdco B.V.

In April 2015, SBB bought Serbian internet provider EUnet for an undisclosed amount. In April 2017, SBB bought Serbian cable operator IKOM. In November 2017, SBB acquired Serbian minor cable company Kabel Group 85.

In September 2018, a British private equity firm BC Partners began the process of acquisition of the majority stakes of United Group from KKR for an enterprise valuation of 2.6 billion euros. Upon finalizing the acquisition, BC partners will officially gain ownership of Serbia Broadband.

In February 2025, United Group announced that SBB will be sold to the e&PPF Telecom Group for 825 million euros. Selling process will be finalized until the first half of the year. The e&PPF Telecom Group, owner of cable and mobile operator Yettel, is joint venture of the e& and PPF Telecom Group active in Serbia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
