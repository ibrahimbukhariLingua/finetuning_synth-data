Reuters Market Data System


# Reuters Market Data System



**Reuters Market Data System** (**RMDS**) is an open market data platform provided by Thomson Reuters. RMDS is used to transport, integrate and manage financial data from stock exchanges and other data sources to end users (such as a bank or enterprise) using multicast or broadcast technology. The underlying protocols are called **Reuters Reliable Control Protocol** (**RRCP**) and the **Reuters Reliable Messaging Protocol** (**RRMP**)


## Features

The last versionʷʰᵉⁿ? of RMDS, version 6, included Reuters Wire Format (RWF) as a major improvement to Marketfeed (MF) used in RMDS version 5 and prior technologies like Triarch, TIB Market Data Distribution System (TIB).

Major components of the platform include Market Data Hub (MDH) and the Point-to-Point Server (P2PS). These components configured together create a basic RMDS deployment. RMDS was commonly used to feed clients such Reuters' analysis and trading platform Reuters 3000 Xtra.

This platform has been replaced by **Thomson Reuters Enterprise Platform for Real-Time** (**TREP-RT**), colloquially known as **TREP**.
