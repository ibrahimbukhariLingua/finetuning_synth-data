## Sustainability and CSR

All of Accolade's buildings in the Czech Republic are BREEAM-certified as at least "Very Good", and in Poland as "Good", relating to the level of environmental friendliness, working conditions for employees, and energy self-sufficiency of the building. The building created by Accolade for cosmetics distribution centre Estée Launder in Cheb industrial zone, operated by DHL, is certified as BREEAM Excellent, among the top-rated buildings in Central Europe. Much of Accolade's promotional material emphasises its environmental credentials.

For several years, the company has been providing support for sheltered housing and social therapeutic workshops by non-profit organisation Mela. They also sponsor scientific projects (Neuron Awards), cultural events (Karlovy Vary International Film Festival), sports, and regional economic initiatives.

Accolade often uses former brownfield land for its projects; the proportion of former brownfield land in its portfolio is 53% in Poland and 22% in the Czech Republic. A further revitalization project is planned for Bochum in Germany, where a new development is due to replace a former Opel factory.
