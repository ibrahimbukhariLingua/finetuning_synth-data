Young Fabians Economy and Finance Network


# Young Fabians Economy and Finance Network



The **Young Fabians Economy and Finance Network** is a British special interest group of the youth section of the Fabian Society, the UK's leading centre-left think tank.

The network originated as a grouping of finance professionals within the Young Fabians. It evolved to provide a general forum for progressives that have an interest in finance and economics. The network developed the first Young Fabians issue-specific journal Anatomy and has done work on UK Government budgets, reforms of the banking sector, housing, alternative financial services and youth financial education.

The network organises an annual programme of policy round-tables, publications, and panel events involving public figures from the worlds of finance, industry, public policy and economic thought.


## Chairs

Chairs of Young Fabians Finance Network are elected at an annual AGM's and hold office for one year.
