# Openbravo



**Openbravo** is a Spanish cloud-based SaaS software provider specializing in retail with headquarters in Pamplona, Spain and offices in Barcelona and Lille. The company was formerly known for being a horizontal open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) software vendor for different industries.


## History

Openbravo's roots are in the development of business administration software, first developed by Nicolas Serrano and Ismael Ciordia, employees of the University of Navarra in the **mid-1990s** who used emerging internet technologies in their work, and subsequently introduced a new approach for building web applications. Their concept was realized in a new company called Tecnicia, founded in August 2001 by Serrano, Ciordia, and Aguinaga. In 2005, two management consultants, Manel Sarasa and Josep Mitjá, were asked by a venture capital company to evaluate Tecnicia and prepare a business plan for its evolution. In 2006, the two consultants joined Tecnicia as the CEO and COO, respectively. Around the same time the Spanish investment company Sodena invested US$6.4 million in the further development of the company.

In 2006, the company was renamed Openbravo and launched its first product offering, Openbravo ERP. The code was made available open-source in April that same year. In 2007, the company announced the acquisition of LibrePOS, a Java-based Point-of-Sale (POS) application for retail and hospitality businesses. LibrePOS was rebranded as Openbravo POS (or Openbravo Java POS). In May 2008 Openbravo attracted three more investors, Amadeus (UK), GIMV (Belgium) and Adara (Spain) for a second investment round totaling $12.5 million to further develop its products and services.

In July 2012, Openbravo launched Openbravo for Retail, including the Openbravo Web POS, a new point-of-sale platform replacing Openbravo Java POS that was web and mobile-friendly.

In March 2014, Openbravo ERP was renamed Openbravo ERP Platform. Openbravo for Retail was renamed to Openbravo Commerce Platform.

In May 2015, the Openbravo Commerce Platform and Openbravo ERP Platform were renamed to Openbravo Commerce Suite and Openbravo Business Suite. Openbravo announces its strategic focus in Retail. Openbravo also launches the Openbravo Subscription Management and Recurring Billing, a specialized solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for recurring transactions-based revenue models.

In February 2016, Openbravo launches Openbravo Cloud, its official cloud offering, and starts the distribution of Openbravo Commerce Cloud, a cloud-based and mobile-enabled omnichannel platform for midsize to large retail and restaurant chains.

In 2018, Openbravo announces a certified SAP connector to facilitate the integration of the Openbravo Commerce Cloud in all those clients running SAP as their central corporate system.

In November 2022 Openbravo joins the French group DL Software, today Orisha. As a result Openbravo becomes Orisha | Openbravo in October 2023.

### Openbravo ERP

Openbravo ERP was the first product launched by Openbravo. It was a web-based enterprise resource planning software for small and medium-sized companies that is released under the Openbravo Public License, based on the Mozilla Public License. The model for the program was originally based on the Compiere ERP program that is also open-source, released under the GNU General Public License version 2. As of January 2008, the program was among the top ten most active projects of SourceForge.

With Openbravo ERP organizations can automate and register the most common business processes, in the fields: Sales, Procurement, Manufacturing, Projects, Finance, MRP and more. Numerous commercial extensions are available on the Openbravo Exchange which can be procured by users with a commercial edition of Openbravo ERP. This paid-for version offers additional functionality compared to the free Community Edition, among them integrated administration tools, a non-technical tool for updates and upgrades, access to Openbravo Exchange and a Service Level Agreement. The characteristic of the Openbravo ERP application is the green web interface through which users maintain company data in a web browser. Openbravo can also create and export reports and data to several formats, such as PDF and Microsoft Excel.

Openbravo's Java-based architecture focuses on two development models:

* model-driven development, in which developers describe the application in terms of models rather than code
* model-view-controller, a well-established design pattern in which the presentation logic and the business logic are kept isolated

These two models allow for integration with other programs and for a simple interface. The application of open standards Openbravo ERP can be integrated with other open source applications like Magento webshop, Pentaho Business Intelligence, ProcessMaker BPM, Liferay Portal and SugarCRM.
