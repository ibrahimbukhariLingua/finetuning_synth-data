H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment


# H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment



**The H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment** was a nonpartisan nonprofit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C. The Center brought together representatives of business, government, the scientific community and the environment community to collaborate on the development of environmental policy and science-based solutions to environmental challenges to society. The Heinz Center is best known as the creator of the *State of the Nation's Ecosystems* reports, which have become seminal references for U.S. policy makers and environmental managers on the conditions of and trends in U.S. ecosystems and habitats and the goods and services they provide. The Center was founded in 1995, in tribute to U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III of Pennsylvania after his untimely death in 1991, and closed in 2013.


## History


### Origin

The Heinz Center was conceived of by the wife of the late Senator H. John Heinz III, Teresa Heinz, who had a vision for a Center where experts from business, science, government and non-governmental organizations could come together to solve seemingly intractable environmental challenges. Following Senator Heinz' death in 1991, The Vera I. Heinz Endowment and several others made a $20 million gift, one of the largest grants ever made to the environment, to create the John Heinz Center, in memory of Senator Heinz. The Center was founded in 1995 in Washington, D.C.

### The State of The Nation's Ecosystems

The State of The Nation's Ecosystems was designed to provide an impartial and comprehensive understanding of the state of and trends in ecosystems, much the way decision makers use gross domestic product (GDP) to gauge national economic health. As part of the project, The Heinz Center published two *State of the Nation's Ecosystems* reports, one in 2002 and one in 2008, and a report on environmental data gaps and policy roadmap for environmental information. Since their publication, the *State of the Nation's Ecosystems* reports have become seminal references for national and regional policymakers and resource managers on the condition and use of ecosystems in the United States. The reports were created with the input of more than 300 scientific experts, who agreed upon a set of 108 indicators to track trends in the health of distinct U.S. ecosystems—coasts and oceans, farmlands, forests, freshwaters, grasslands and shrublands, and urban and suburban land-use types—on the national, regional, and local levels.
