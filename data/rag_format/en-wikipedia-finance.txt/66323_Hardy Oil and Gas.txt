Hardy Oil and Gas


# Hardy Oil and Gas



**Hardy Oil and Gas plc** was a British-based oil and gas exploration and production business. It is now based in the Isle of Man and was a former constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.


## History

The business had its origins in a company established by Trafalgar House as *Hardy Oil and Gas* to exploit North Sea oil reserves in the 1970s.

The business was restructured on merger by S. Karra and Y. Sharma in 1997 as *Jehan Energy Ltd* to exploit oil and gas opportunities in India.

In 1999 British-Borneo Exploration merged with Hardy Oil and Gas. Charles Reimer became president. Due to the merger changes were made to the executive board - Alan Gaynor was CEO; Peter Hill became technical director and Steve Holliday was international director. Mark Adams, Will Roach, Mike Adams and Mike King were named VPs.

In 1999 *Jehan Energy Ltd* acquired the Indian interests of the original *Hardy Oil and Gas* and changed its own name in 2001 to *Hardy Oil and Gas plc*. (The non-Indian interests were acquired by Eni.)

In 2005 the Company was first listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange; it has since moved to the main market.

In 2007 the Company announced a successful well test on the Oza field in Nigeria.

The Company was reclassified as a constituent of the FTSE SmallCap Index on 22 December 2008, thereby dropping out of the FTSE 250 Index and FTSE 350 Index.

The company sold off Hardy Exploration & Production (India) Inc. (HEPI) in October 2019 to Hindustan Oil Exploration Co. Ltd. (HOEC). Hardy effectively became a cash shell


## Operations
