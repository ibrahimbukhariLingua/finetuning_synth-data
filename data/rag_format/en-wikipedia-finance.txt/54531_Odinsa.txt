# Odinsa



**Odinsa S.A** is a Colombian construction and infrastructure development and publicly traded company (the largest engineering association in Colombia). It engages in road, highway, airport (about 18% of total sales) and railway construction in addition to real estate and private/public grant projects (through concessions). Real estate projects are developed through the subsidiary Odinsa Holding Inc. The company also does business outside of Colombia, mostly in the Dominican Republic and other parts of the Caribbean. In 2002 it participated in a Social Interest Housing Project (50% interest) which built 450 homes.

Odinsa is considered one of the eight "leading operators of transportation infrastructure worldwide". On September 14, 2010, it had a market cap of US$549.45 million (based on exchange rate of 1908.51 COP/1 USD).

According to the 2010 Global Competitiveness Report, Colombia's public infrastructure quality (railroads, ports and especially roads) is among the worst in South America, meaning that companies like Odinsa should continue to be in high demand (the company had a backlog of US$1.2 billion in 2010 - up 20% over the previous year). It has benefited from the government's relaxation of control restrictions on foreign investment in the country.
