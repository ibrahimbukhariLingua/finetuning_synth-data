Chartered Management Institute


# Chartered Management Institute



The **Chartered Management Institute** (**CMI**) is a professional institution for management based in the United Kingdom. It was founded as the **British Institute of Management** (BIM) in 1947 or 1948, merged with the **Institution of Industrial Managers** (IIM) in 1992 to form the **Institute of Management** (IM), and gained a royal charter, and its present name, in 2002.

The major membership classes are:

* *Member*
* *Fellow* – for those with significant expertise, and
* *Companion* – the most senior grade.

In addition to supporting its members, the organisation encourages management development, carries out research, produces a wide variety of publications on management interests, and publishes the official members' magazine, *Professional Manager*. The institute also engages with government and other public bodies concerning policy on management and business related issues. *Professional Manager* magazine is circulated to over 80,000 members of the CMI.


## Chartered Manager (CMgr)

The Chartered Manager process requires candidates to demonstrate how they have developed as a manager and how they have applied their leadership and management skills to achieve significant business impact. Following an application, successful candidate are entitled to use the designatory post-nominal letters of **CMgr**.

There are two routes to becoming Chartered:

* **Assessment Route** - Available to those who have completed a degree level qualification in management with at least three years managerial experience or for those without degree qualification to have a minimum of five years relevant experience.
* **Fast Track Route** - Available to those who hold at least a CMI Level 5 Diploma with at least three years of relevant managerial experience.

Candidate who have less than 3 years managerial experience might be given the Foundation Chartered status, which requires a management qualification at a degree/non-degree level equivalent to at least CMI Level 3,4 or 5 and/or CMI Level 6 and 7. This grade carries entitlement to use the designatory post-nominal letters of **fCMgr**.

Criteria and requirements for chartered status in the UK have to be approved by the Privy Council; as such the criteria for Chartered Manager designation are "broadly similar" to chartered statuses in other fields.

Timeline

* 1945 - Sir Stafford Cripps, the president of the Board of Trade appointed a Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Clive Baillieu (president of the Federation of British Industries - the forerunner of the CBS) to formulate detailed proposals for the establishment of a central institution for all aspects related to management.
