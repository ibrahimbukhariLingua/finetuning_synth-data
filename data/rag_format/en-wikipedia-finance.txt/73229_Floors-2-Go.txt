# Floors-2-Go



**Floors-2-Go** was a wood flooring retailer in the United Kingdom, established in 1999. In 2012, the company's affiliates took over Allied Carpets in a pre-pack administration deal.


## History

Floors-2-Go was founded in 1999 as a family business, with the first store opening in Birmingham. In 2004, the firm floated on the London Stock Exchange. This saw the firm evolving from cash-and-carry (wholesale)-type warehouses to retail superstores.

In 2005, Floors-2-Go opened its first stores in Northern Ireland. Later that year, the company announced plans to expand to around 350 stores.

In 2007, Floors-2-Go was sold for £52.4 million to its directors and private equity firm Alchemy Partners, at which point it ceased trading on the London Stock Exchange.


### Administration

In 2008, the firm entered administration for the first time, with its business hit by a slump in the housing market. The administrators, Kroll immediately closed 41 of the group's 132 stores, resulting in 97 redundancies from a workforce of around 450 ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.

The firm was saved but entered administration for a second time in 2011. Senate Recovery, the administrators, closed a further 53 stores, but retained 35.

In 2014, the business entered administration for the third time. MB Insolvency were appointed administrators, and made a further reduction in the number of stores and staff... However, the business re-entered administration the following year, this time with a jail threat to the brothers who owned the chain.

The company was eventually dissolved in 2017.
