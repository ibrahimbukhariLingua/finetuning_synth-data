Glass Ceiling Index


# Glass Ceiling Index



**Glass-Ceiling Index** (GCI) is an annual index for visualizing the glass ceiling metaphor, created by *The Economist*, combining data on higher education, labour-force participation, pay, child cares costs, maternity and paternity rights business-school applications and representation in senior jobs. In the 2024 index, the countries where inequality was the lowest were Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and France. The countries lowest on the index were Israel, Switzerland, Japan, Turkey and South Korea. This index shows how women are still lagging their male counterparts in senior business roles. It is updated every year in a rank of 29 OECD countries. It was launched in 2013 when there were five indicators and 26 countries, but today consists of ten indicators (higher education, labour-force participation, gender wage gap, GMAT exams taken by women, women in managerial positions, women on company boards, net child-care costs, paid leave for mothers, paid leave for fathers and women in parliament) for 29 OECD countries.
