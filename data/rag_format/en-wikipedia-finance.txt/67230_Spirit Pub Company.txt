Spirit Group then acquired Scottish & Newcastle’s retail business, before itself being re acquired by Punch in May 2006. Spirit was demerged from Punch Taverns for a second time in August 2011.

The shareholders accepted a takeover offer from Greene King in January 2015. The takeover was completed in June 2015.
