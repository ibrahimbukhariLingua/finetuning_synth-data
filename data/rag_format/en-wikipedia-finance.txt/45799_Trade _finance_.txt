Trade (finance)


# Trade (finance)



In finance, a **trade** is an exchange of a security such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives or any valuable financial instrument for "cash". Such a financial transaction is usually done by participants of an exchange such as a stock exchange, commodity exchange or futures exchange with a short-dated promise to pay in the currency of the country where the 'exchange' is located.

The price is agreed between the buyer and seller on the execution of the trade and is guided by the supply and demand for that financial instrument. Once the trade is executed a number of steps take place until the trade is finally settled. There is a pre-defined settlement period for this to happen in each market.
