# Saifedean Ammous



**Saifedean Ammous** (born October 24, 1980) is a Palestinian-Jordanian economist, author, and prominent advocate of Bitcoin. Ammous is best known for his book The Bitcoin Standard (2018), which explains the economics of Bitcoin grounded in the principles of Austrian economics and critiques modern fiat currencies and contemporary economics. He has gained a significant following among Bitcoin enthusiasts, libertarians, and those skeptical of mainstream economic systems.


## Early Life and Education

Ammous was born in Nablus, Palestine, and spent his early years in Saudi Arabia and Brazil before moving to Ramallah in the West Bank in 1990. He completed high school at the Ramallah Friends School in 1998. Ammous then attended the American University of Beirut, earning a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, followed by a Master’s in Development Management from the London School of Economics. He later obtained a PhD in Sustainable Development from Columbia University.


## Academic Career

Ammous began his academic career as an assistant professor of economics at the Lebanese American University in Beirut. His research initially focused on development economics, resource economics, and energy. Over time, he became increasingly critical of fiat money systems and conventional economic policies, leading him to advocate for Austrian economics and Bitcoin.


## The Bitcoin Standard

Ammous published *The Bitcoin Standard* in 2018, which has since become one of the most widely read books on Bitcoin and Austrian economics, translated into 38 languages. The book explains Bitcoin’s development, attributes, and limitations, placing it within the broader context of monetary history. Ammous argues that Bitcoin, with its limited supply and permissionless nature, represents the most advanced form of money and a viable alternative to inflation-prone fiat currencies.

The book has attracted endorsements from high-profile individuals, such as Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, who has credited it as a major influence on his company’s decision to adopt a Bitcoin standard. Saylor has publicly recommended *The Bitcoin Standard* as essential reading for those interested in monetary theory and the potential of Bitcoin. Additionally, U.S. Congressman Warren Davidson praised *The Bitcoin Standard* as “one of the best books in recent memory,” further reflecting the influence of Ammous’s work on policy discussions.


## Later Works and Influence

Following the success of *The Bitcoin Standard*, Ammous released *The Fiat Standard* in 2021, which examines the economic, social, and political consequences of fiat currency. In it, he expands on his critiques of fiat money, which he sees as a root cause of economic instability and increased government power.

In 2022, Ammous published *Principles of Economics*, designed to teach the foundations of economic theory from an Austrian perspective, further establishing his stance against traditional Keynesian economics. He was appointed as an economic advisor to the government of El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, advising President Nayib Bukele and the Bitcoin Office on Bitcoin's integration into the country’s financial system.

Ammous frequently speaks at international conferences, appears on podcasts, and teaches courses on economics, Bitcoin, and Austrian economics. He has been a vocal critic of central banking and Keynesian economics, which he argues are unsustainable and lead to detrimental economic cycles.


## Criticism and Controversy

Ammous’s ideas have sparked controversy, especially his views on fiat currency and central banking. Critics argue that his analysis does not fully address Bitcoin’s technical challenges, such as scalability and energy consumption, and that it oversimplifies complex economic issues. Despite these critiques, he remains an influential voice in the fields of cryptocurrency and Austrian economics.
