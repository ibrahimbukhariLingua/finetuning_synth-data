In 1989, with MIT classmates Michael J. Saylor and Thomas Spahr, Bansal co-founded MicroStrategy. Bansal helped build MicroStrategy with no venture capital, often working 80 to 100 hours per week to get the company off the ground. During this time, the company experienced rapid growth, increasing revenues by 100% every year between 1990 and 1996. In June 1998, MicroStrategy had its initial public offering and, on its first day of trading, the stock price doubled. By March 2000, the company had a market cap of approximately $24 billion, making Bansal and other company leaders billionaires on paper.

Later that month, MicroStrategy announced that it would restate its financial results for the preceding two years, which resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In December 2000, Saylor, Bansal, and the company's former CFO settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by each paying $350,000 in fines. The officers also paid a combined total of $10 million in disgorgement.

Subsequently, the company's stock price plummeted, from a high of $333.00 in March to a low of $9.25 by December 2000. As chief operating officer, Bansal played a significant role in getting MicroStrategy back on its feet. He was instrumental in raising more than $175 million in the following 17 months to keep the company going and expanding business into China in 2002. The company employed more than 3,200 people worldwide and reported revenue of $594.61 million in 2012. As of 2013, the company has operations in 26 countries.

In 2013, Bansal co-founded Hunch Analytics with Aneesh Chopra, which currently contains one portfolio company: CareJourney, a healthcare data analytics firm.
