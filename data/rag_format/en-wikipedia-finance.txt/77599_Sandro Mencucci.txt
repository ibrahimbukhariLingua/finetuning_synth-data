A chartered accountant and fiscal lawyer by profession, Mencucci joined ACF Fiorentina as CEO and board director in the summer of 2002 when the Della Valle Family, owners of the fashion brands Tod's, Fay, Hogan and Roger Vivier, acquired the defaulted club and initiated a new entity starting from the 4th tier Serie C2.

The principal objective is to promote Fair Play, the value of playing sports with respect for the adversary and fans. Mencucci led the club from its initial insertion into Serie C2, Italian fourth division, to its promotion back to Serie A in 2004. The club qualified for three consecutive years for the UEFA Europa League and has held one of the top four positions in the Italian Serie A league for the last three consecutive seasons.
