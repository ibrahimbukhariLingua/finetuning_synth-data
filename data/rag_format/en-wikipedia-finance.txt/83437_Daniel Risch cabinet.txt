The **Daniel Risch cabinet** is the current chief executive body of Liechtenstein, being sworn in on 25 March 2021. It was appointed by Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein and is chaired by Daniel Risch.


## History

The 2021 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a virtual tie between the Patriotic Union and the Progressive Citizens' Party and Daniel Risch was appointed as Prime Minister of Liechtenstein on 25 March 2021, heading a new coalition government with the Progressive Citizens' Party.

During the government's term in office, in November 2022, the Landtag of Liechtenstein passed a motion calling on the government to introduce a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, with broad support from across the political spectrum. A bill legalizing same-sex marriage was introduced in February 2024 and passed its final reading in the Landtag on 16 May 2024 by a 24–1 vote.

In addition, the government oversaw Liechtenstein's accession to the International Monetary Fund, and started the proceedings for it in 2024. Liechtenstein joined the IMF on 21 October 2024. This came after a successful referendum was held the previous month.

On 19 February 2024 Risch declared his intention to not run for re-election. The 2025 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a win for the Patriotic Union.
