# Mpower Financing



**Mpower Financing** (stylized as *MPOWER Financing*) is a public-benefit corporation. It is based in Washington, DC, with an office in Bangalore, India. It was founded by Manu Smadja and Michael Davis in 2014, both of whom attended INSEAD in Paris where they met.


## Overview

Mpower Financing offers its student loans to students who cannot typically qualify for a loan from other banks or lenders unless they have a co-signer or collateral. Mpower Financing lends to students who are within two years from graduation. Many recipients are international (non-American) and DACA students. Mpower Financing's services are available at 350 university and college programs as of March 2018. Around 90% of its borrowers are in graduate school.


## History

Mpower Financing was founded by Manu Smadja and Michael Davis in 2014. Both had faced difficulties financing their education in the US, and met in 2009 at INSEAD in Paris while they were working on their MBAs. The company launched officially with Harvard as its first university partner. As of 2021, Mpower has raised $160 million in equity funding and $200 million in debt financing. Investors include Goldman Sachs, King Street Capital Management, and Gray Matters Capital.

In 2016, MPOWER opened an India office, in Bangalore.

In July 2017, Mpower Financing's services became available in all 50 states due to a partnership between the company and Bank of Lake Mills. In August 2017, Mpower Financing announced a $100 million debt round in order to offer more student loans. On February 16, 2017, it was reported that Mpower Financing had received more than $150 million in loan applications. In the summer of 2017, Mpower Financing began working with credit reporting agency Nova Credit to simplify the application and underwriting process for international applicants.

In 2018, Mpower launched its Canadian international student loan program at 12 universities across Ontario and British Columbia. That same year, Mpower added a scholarship program, the Mpower Global Citizenship Scholarship. Four awards are given per year, each one amounting to $5,000.

As of April 2019, it was reported that Mpower Financing had received over $1 billion in loan applications.
