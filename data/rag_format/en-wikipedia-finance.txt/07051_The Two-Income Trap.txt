# The Two-Income Trap



***The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke*** is a 2004 popular nonfiction book by Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi. The book examines the causes of increasing rates of personal bankruptcy and economic insecurity in American households. It was reissued in 2016.


## Authors

At the time of publication, Elizabeth Warren was a professor of commercial law at Harvard University, specializing in
bankruptcy law. Her earlier writing was primarily aimed at academic audiences. She was considered a leading figure in the then-active debate over personal bankruptcy law, in which she argued for generous access to bankruptcy protection. She would later enter politics, campaigning successfully for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, before being elected US Senator from the state of Massachusetts.

Amelia Warren Tyagi is a management consultant formerly with McKinsey & Company. She holds a Master of Business Administration from The Wharton School.


## Synopsis


### Causal factors

The authors present quantitative data to demonstrate how American middle-class families have been left in a precarious financial position by increases in fixed living expenses, increased medical expenses, escalating real estate prices, lower employment security, and the relaxation of credit regulation. The result has been a reshaping of the American labor force, such that many families now rely on having two incomes in order to meet their expenses. This situation represents a greater level of financial risk than that faced by single-income households: the inability of either adult to work, even temporarily, may result in loss of employment, and concomitant loss of medical coverage and the ability to pay bills. This may lead to bankruptcy or being forced to move somewhere less expensive, with associated decreases in educational quality and economic opportunity.

Among the expenses driving the two-income trap are child care, housing in areas with good schools, and college tuition. Warren and Tyagi conclude that having children is the "single best predictor" that a woman will go bankrupt.

Warren and Tyagi call stay-at-home mothers of past generations "the most important part of the safety net", as the non-working mother could step in to earn extra income or care for sick family members when needed. However, Warren and Tyagi dismiss the idea of return to stay-at-home parents, and instead propose policies to offset the loss of this form of insurance.

Warren and Tyagi attempt to overturn the "overconsumption myth" that Americans' financial instabilities are the result of frivolous spending â€“ they note, for instance, that families are spending less on clothing, food (including meals out), and large appliances, when adjusted for inflation, than a generation prior. They also note that dual-income households have less discretionary money than single-income households a generation prior.


### Proposals

The authors propose several solutions to the "two-income trap". In order to decouple educational opportunity from real estate location, they propose allowing families to choose among public schools in their district, with a voucher system. They recommend tuition freezes for public universities, which have seen tuitions rise three times faster than inflation. They endorse universal preschool as a means of reducing fixed costs for families with children. Warren and Tyagi take care to consider possible perverse consequences of various social programs aimed at middle-class economic relief.

Warren and Tyagi also call for the restoration of "usury laws" limiting credit interest rates, and increased disclosure requirements for creditors. They suggest revisiting policies that have encouraged home ownership, such as policies that make mortgages available with little or no down payment. The authors heavily criticize then-Senator Joe Biden for promoting legislation friendly to the banking industry. Biden and Warren would later compete for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, which Biden would win before going on to win the 2020 United States presidential election.
