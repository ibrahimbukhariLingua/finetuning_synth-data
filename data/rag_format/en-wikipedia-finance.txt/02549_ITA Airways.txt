# ITA Airways



**Italia Trasporto Aereo S.p.A.** (pronounced [iˈtaːlja traˈspɔrto aˈɛːreo]), doing business as **ITA Airways**, is the flag carrier airline of Italy. It is owned by the government of Italy via the Ministry of Economy and Finance and Lufthansa Group. The airline was founded in 2020 as a successor to the bankrupt Alitalia. The airline flies to over 70 scheduled domestic, European, and intercontinental destinations. Its main hub is Rome Fiumicino Airport near Rome and a focus city is Linate Airport near Milan. In 2025 ITA Airways initiated the alliance change: on 3 February the airline ended its membership in SkyTeam to join Star Alliance in 2026 as part of the integration into the Lufthansa Group.


## History


### Background

Italy's flag carrier Alitalia had been in operation since 1946. It was owned by the Italian government until 2009 when it became a private company after reorganizing and merging with the bankrupt Italian airline Air One. Alitalia reorganized again in 2015 after receiving an investment from Etihad Airways, with Air France–KLM already owning a minority stake. With multiple failed attempts to make the airline profitable, the airline was placed under extraordinary administration in 2017 just days after Etihad Airways ended its support of Alitalia. On 17 May 2017, after the government ruled out nationalizing the airline, it was officially put on the auction block.

After multiple failed negotiations with Delta Air Lines, EasyJet, Italian railway company Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, and China Eastern Airlines, the Italian government took ownership of the airline in March 2020. The government takeover was due in part to the belief the airline would not be able to survive the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its own. On 10 October 2020, the Italian government signed a decree to allow the airline to reorganize as Italia Trasporto Aereo S.p.A.


### 2020

On 28 October 2020, it was reported that ITA was expected to buy several assets from Alitalia – Società Aerea Italiana S.p.A., including the brand and the flight codes of Alitalia and Alitalia CityLiner, the IATA ticketing code (055), the MilleMiglia frequent-flyer program, and airport slots at London Heathrow (68 weekly slots in summer and 65 in winter). The transaction was expected to cost €220 million.


### 2021

However, on 8 January 2021, the European Commission sent a letter to the Italian Permanent Representative to the European Union calling for Italy to launch an "open, transparent, non-discriminatory and unconditional tender" to shed Alitalia assets. The letter consisted of 62 requests for clarification, rejecting the idea that the old carrier could sell its assets to the new company with no open bidding. The letter stated that ITA should not retain the Alitalia brand since the brand is an emblematic indicator of continuity. The European Commission suggested that the combined aviation, ground handling, and maintenance businesses should be sold separately to a third party. It also suggested that slots must be sold, and that the MilleMiglia program in its entirety could not be transferred to the new corporate entity.

On 26 August 2021, ITA officially opened ticket sales on its newly launched website.

On 27 August 2021, ITA applied for an Exemption and a Foreign Air Carrier Permit with the United States Department of Transportation. The document noted the airline's intention to start flying to New York-JFK, Boston and Miami in 2021, Los Angeles and Washington-Dulles in 2022, and Chicago-O'Hare and San Francisco in 2023. The same document stated that before the start of its flight operations, planned for 15 October 2021, ITA would acquire certain assets from Alitalia – Società Aerea Italiana S.p.A., and that ITA would also participate in a public tender to acquire the "Alitalia" brand.

On 30 September 2021, ITA announced that it would work with Airbus as a "strategic partner", providing details of its fleet plans. The airline announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus for the purchase of 10 Airbus A330neo, 7 Airbus A220 and 11 Airbus A320neo aircraft, for a total of 28, along with an agreement with Air Lease Corporation to lease an additional 31 new Airbus aircraft, including the Airbus A350-900.

On 22 October 2021, former Alitalia employees who had not been rehired protested against ITA. Women at the demonstration shouted slogans wearing only white nightgowns. Company CEO Alfredo Altavilla called the protest "a national shame".

ITA officially joined the SkyTeam alliance on 29 October 2021, but for the time being only for one year until new owners have been found and a long-term strategy has been made.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Starting on 2 December 2021, ITA started carrying flights with the Pope when making pastoral and state visits to a country starting with Pope Francis, replacing Alitalia for most outbound papal flights.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The Pope's flight is often nicknamed "Shepherd One" by the press, while the actual callsign is "Volo Papale" (papal flight, in Italian) followed by a serial number.


### 2022

On 24 January 2022, ITA announced that MSC Group and Lufthansa Group had expressed an interest in becoming majority owners of the Italian airline, with the Italian Government keeping a minority stake. On 10 March 2022, fellow SkyTeam members Delta Air Lines and the Air France-KLM group also expressed interest in investing in ITA, by teaming up with investment firm Certares. Indigo Partners also expressed interest, leaving a total of three interested parties. After the deadline ended on 23 May 2022, only MSC/Lufthansa and Air France-KLM/Certares bid for ITA. As of 31 August 2022, the Italian government has stated their preference for the Air France-KLM/Certares bid, initiating exclusive talks with the group.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In its first year of operation, the airline carried 9 million passengers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### 2023

On 19 January 2023, Lufthansa Group submitted a bid to the Italian Government to begin acquiring a minority share in the airline, to purchase the remaining shares over an extended period and have the airline join the larger Lufthansa Group. On 27 January 2023, the Italian government and Lufthansa signed a letter of intent over the sale of a minority stake, paving the way for exclusive negotiations with the German aviation group. On 25 May 2023 Lufthansa Group reached an agreement on the acquisition of a 41% stake in ITA Airways.


### 2024

The acquisition by Lufthansa Group received approval from the European Commission on 3 July 2024.


### 2025

On 17 January, Lufthansa Group acquired 41% of ITA, making ITA Airways the fifth network airline of the Lufthansa Group, alongside Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian and Brussels Airlines. Between 2025 and 2029, there is the option for Lufthansa Group to acquire an additional 49% of ITA, and a further option to acquire the remaining 10% after 2029, making ITA a wholly-owned subsidiary.

On 3 February, Lufthansa Group and SkyTeam announced that ITA Airways had left the airline alliance. Following a transitional period, ITA will join Star Alliance in first half of 2026.

On 30 March, at the start of the summer schedule, ITA Airways will move its operations at Frankfurt Airport from Terminal 2 into Terminal 1; and from Terminal 1 into Terminal 2 at Munich Airport to be under one roof with other Lufthansa Group and Star Alliance Airlines.
