CFA Institute Research Challenge


# CFA Institute Research Challenge



The **CFA Institute Research Challenge** is an annual global competition in equity research hosted by the CFA Institute started in 2007. The competition provides university students with hands-on training and mentoring in financial analysis. Students assume the role of a research analyst and are scored based on their ability to value a stock, write an initiation-of-coverage report, and present their recommendations. The competition is split by 3 geographical regions, Asia Pacific, EMEA, and the Americas. Both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to participate. Teams begin in local competitions, from which winners advance to regional competitions. A final competition held in April identifies the winning team at the global level.

For 2019, more than 6,100 students from over 1,150 universities from 95 countries participated in the competition.


## Team Compositions

Teams are sponsored by a university located within the area of the local competition in which the team wishes to compete. Each university may field up to two teams of three to five members.
