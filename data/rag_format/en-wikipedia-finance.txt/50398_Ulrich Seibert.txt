In 1986, he moved to the Federal Ministry of Justice in Bonn, where he became head of the division for cabinet and parliamentary affairs under Minister Klaus Kinkel in 1990. He has been head of the division for company law and corporate governance since 1992 and was appointed Ministerialrat in 1997.

Since the early nineties, Ulrich Seibert has drafted most laws within the field of company law and corporate governance and has represented Germany also at EU, OECD and G20 level. He was responsible for drafting the 1994 law on "kleine Aktiengesellschaften" (closed limited companies on shares), the law concerning the Corporate Sector Supervision and Transparency Act (Gesetz zur Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich – KonTraG, 1998), which was the first important corporate governance reform in Germany, the law on no-par value shares (Stückaktiengesetz – StückAG, 1998), the law on registered shares and the facilitating of the exercise of voting rights (Gesetz zur Namensaktie und zur Erleichterung der Stimmrechtsausübung – NaStraG, 2001), and the Act on Corporate Integrity and Modernization of the Law to Challenge Decisions by the Shareholders' Meeting (Gesetz zur Unternehmensintegrität und Modernisierung des Anfechtungsrechts – UMAG, 2004).

During the 16th legislative period in Germany (October 2005-October 2009), Seibert prepared numerous legislative proposals, such as the Act on Electronic Commercial Registers (Gesetz über das Elektronische Handels- und Genossenschaftsregister sowie das Unternehmensregister – EHUG) and the Act to Modernize the Law Governing Private Limited Companies and to Combat Abuses (Gesetz zur Modernisierung des GmbH-Rechts und zur Bekämpfung von Missbräuchen – MoMiG, 2008) – which constituted the first major GmbH reform since the creation of this law in the late 19th century. He also drafted the politically controversial amendment of the Volkswagen Law, the Act Implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Aktionärsrechterichtlinie – ARUG), and the Act on Appropriate Executive Board Remuneration (Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung – VorstAG).

He also worked on the 2014 reform of stock company law, the proposal for an EU directive to amend the Shareholder Rights Directive, (implemented into German Law as "ARUG II" in the 19th legislative period).
