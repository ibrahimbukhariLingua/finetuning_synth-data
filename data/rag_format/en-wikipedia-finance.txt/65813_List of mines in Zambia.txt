\*\*In January 2021. the Zambian government, through the ZZCM-IH, took on US$1.5 billion in debt to and acquired the 90% shares of Mopani Copper Mines Plc from Carlisa Investments Corporation and became the sole owner of Mopani Copper Mines Plc.

Prior to January 2021, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (Mopani) was a joint venture company based in Kitwe as 95% of its operations are located there, comprising Glencore International AG (73.1%), First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (16.9%) and Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines Limited (10%). Mopani operates the Mufulira mine, smelter, concentrator and copper refinery and the Nkana mine, concentrator and cobalt plant. MCM produced 134,800 tons of copper and 2040 tons of cobalt in 2003. MCM is investing in a number of oxide copper projects at several of its properties, including an in-situ leaching project at Mufulira and heap leaching at Nkana, and has achieved significant production increases at its underground mining operations in Kitwe and Mufulira. Copper production from internal sources was supplemented by the purchase of some 18,000 tons of copper in high-grade oxide concentrate bought from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The company aims to rebuild the Mufulira smelter during 2004 and 2005, and also plans to add a new gas collection facility and acid plant at a total cost of US$95 million.

In July 2022 ZCCM-Investment Holdings agreed to offer corporate guarantees of up to US$15.0 million to Atlas Mara Bank Zambia Limited to provide working capital to Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) to inject liquidity for its operations.

In October 2022 Sibanye-Stillwater expressed an interest to acquire Zambia's Mopani Copper Mines, the mine and smelter complex looking for new investors after Glencore sold the asset to the state in January 2021. Zambia's state mining firm ZCCM-IH hired Rothschild in June 2022 to help find a new investor to upgrade and expand it.

\*In February 2024, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines-Investment Holdings (ZCCM-IH) approved the acquisition of a 51 percent stake worth 25.5 bn kwacha (US$1.1 bn)in Mopani Copper Mines Plc by Delta Mining Limited a subsidiary of International Resource Holdings (IRH) that is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.


### Mufulira mine

The largest underground mine in Africa, the Mufulira Mine employs 10,000 people; includes a concentrator, a refinery and a smelter; and produces 300,000 tons of copper each year through the process of open stoping. The copper is then taken to the concentrator.


### Mufulira concentrator

The concentrator crushes ores coming from the Mufulira mine consisting of 46% copper, waters it, and then does the process of flotation so the waste material can be removed.


### Mufulira smelter

Built in 1927, the smelter melts the copper mixed with limestone in the Isasmelt furnace. The copper is pressurised by the air, then oxidised, and finally poled. The copper is then taken to the refinery. Mopani completed the third and final phase of upgrading its Mufulira Smelter in the first quarter of 2014.


### Mufulira refinery

The copper is cast into anodes so the process of electrolysis can take place during refining.


### Nkana mine

Nkana mine is one of the largest in Africa, a copper mine located 1 km south-west of Kitwe. The mine is underground as well as open pit and is in operation since 1932 and has produced 6,000,000 tons of copper so far. Its reserves underground include 69,000,000 tons of grading, 16,000,000 tons of copper, and 98,000 tons of cobalt. Its resources include 126,000,000 tons of grading, 43,000,000 tons of copper, and 300,000 tons of cobalt. Copper and cobalt mineralisation occur within the ore shale. Copper mineralisation in the deposits changes from mostly chalcopyrite in the South Orebody, to chalcopyrite-bornite in the Central area and to bornite-chalcopyrite at Mindola. Cobalt occurs as carrollite and cobaltiferous pyrite in approximately equal proportions. The mine produces copper and cobalt from three sources: Mindola Shaft, Central Shaft and South Orebody Shaft. Vertical crater retreat is the predominant mining method while sublevel open-stopping and sublevel caving methods are also used. Other metallurgical facilities, under a management contract by an affiliate of the Anglo American Group, include the Nkana smelter (not owned by Mopani), acid plant (not owned by Mopani) and copper refinery (not owned by Mopani). There is extensive mine tailings around this mine.


### Nkana concentrator

Nkana concentrator of Mopani mines, located in Kitwe, treats copper-cobalt sulphide ore using a bulk flotation and segregation flotation flowsheet to produce separate copper and cobalt concentrates. Nkana Concentrator is the most important mineral processing unit of Mopani, as it contributes about 65% of cobalt concentrates treated at the Nkana and Chambeshi Cobalt plants to produce high purity cobalt metal.


### Nkana and chambeshi cobalt plants

The cobalt plant treats 65% of the cobalt concentrates to produce high purity cobalt metal. The two cobalt plants are Nkana cobalt plant and Chambeshi cobalt plant. Glencore has also used acid leaching, a method used to extract ore, in order to effectively extract and produce copper and cobalt.

In May 2022 Mopani Copper Mines announced its intention to restart processing cobalt on account of the rising prices of the metal which it halted more than a decade ago after international prices collapsed.


### Mufulira copper and cobalt processing plant

In May 2022, Blue Star Resources Ltd, a subsidiary of Blue Star Capital, of the United Arab Emirates in a joint venture with Mopani Copper Mines (MCM) announced plans to invest US$300.0 million into a new Copper and Cobalt processing facility to be located in Mufulira District. The intention is to develop the two historical copper slag dumpsites in the district.

The project is expected to create 300 new permanent jobs and incorporates plans to invest US$2.5 million into each of the three constituencies in the district as part of the JV's Corporate Social Responsibility Program CSRP.


## Konkola copper and cobalt mines

Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) is the largest copper mining company in the country. Although based in Chingola, 15% of its operations—namely Nkana Refinery, Nkana Acid Plants and Nkana Smelter (the largest smelter in the nation) -- are located in Kitwe. The Nkana Smelter is the largest primary copper production plant in Zambia. The plant treats concentrates mainly from Nkana, Nchanga, and Konkola mines, which are wholly owned by KCM to produce up to 150,000 tons of new copper.

\*2004 Acquisition Cost


### Nkana smelter

The smelter produces high grade anodes, which are electrolytically refined. Sulphur dioxide gas produced by the converters is converted into sulphuric acid which is then used at the Tailings Leach Plant in Nchanga for recovering oxide copper. The smelter also produces discard slag from the reverbs that is rich in cobalt which is stored for future reclamation. This smelter was part of the Konkola Copper Mine's operation at privatisation and has subsequently closed.


### Nkana refinery

The Nkana Copper Refinery produces electrolytically refined copper in the form of cathodes. The copper meets the LME premium quality grade. The tankhouse has a capacity of about 180,000 tons of finished copper per annum. It has been expanded to accommodate the increased anode production from the Nchanga smelter.


### Nkana acid plants

## Munali nickel mine

Munali Nickel Mine, in Mazabuka, Southern Province.

In September 2006 following a positive feasibility study, Albidon Limited of Australia obtained permits and approvals to mine Nickel in Mazabuka. The initial project development required more than U$180 million, which was funded by debt financing from Barclays Capital and the European Investment Bank and equity from Albidon Limited, JINCHUAN mining group of China and ZCCM Investment Holdings .

In April 2007, then Zambian President, Levy Mwanawasa launched the Munali Nickel Project at a ground breaking ceremony. The mine would be built and operated under the venture's special purpose vehicle Albidon Zambia Limited (AZL).

AZL commenced mining and production of nickel concentrates in April 2008. Operations were suspended in 2009 because of poor market conditions. From the peak of the Financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 the Mine would struggle for many years.

It was briefly owned and run by JINCHUAN mining group of China from 2010. JINCHUAN would invest U$37 million and employ about 350 workers. However, the mine was shut down again in 2011 due to cashflow problems.

A joint venture Mabiza Resources between Consolidated Nickel Mines Plc of the United kingdom and CE Mining took ownership in 2014 but delayed capital injection which led the government of Zambia at the time to threaten repossession of the asset. From 2015 the JV has placed in U$50 million investment to reboot operations at the Munali Nickel Mine. The Mine recommenced operations in 2019.

The mine is managed by an all-Zambian management team and currently has a workforce of 380 people, of which 10% are women. Munali currently exports over 10% high quality Nickel concentrate. The mine is expected to generate 3,300t of Ni in 2020, which is anticipated to reach 4,000t in 2021. Although it is billed as a nickel project, Munali also contains commercial quantities of copper, cobalt and platinum group metals (PGMs).


## Enterprise nickel project

The Enterprise Nickel Project is an open-pit nickel mine, owned by First Quantum Minerals of Canada, 12 km from the Kalumbila Mine. The Kalumbila Mine processing facility will be used to produce nickel concentrate output.

The Project, estimated at U$275 million, was expected to be operational at the end of 2021 but as of March 2022 was still yet to be operational. In May 2022, First Quantum Minerals approved an additional US$100 million investment the project, which is now expected to commence production in 2023.

In May 2022, following questions about whether FQM held a licence to mine Nickel in Zambia, the company confirmed that it held a valid license up to 2036 to mine and produce Nickel concentrate.

At the projected capacity of 30,000 tons of Nickel annually, FQM is expected to rake in about US$1 billion in revenue annually at May 2022 market prices.

In July 2022, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema officiated at the ground breaking ceremony for the project.

In August 2023, the Enterprise Nickel Mine was commissioned. Production at the Nickel mine concentrator had commenced and the mining firm was expected to ramp up annual production to more than 30,000 tonnes of Nickel.
