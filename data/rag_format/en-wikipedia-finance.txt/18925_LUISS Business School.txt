## History

Luiss Business School was founded in 1986 as *Luiss School of Management*, as the university division dedicated to post-graduate training. In 1991, the first Master of business administration was established, followed in 1995 by the first programme of doctoral degrees in business administration, corporate finance, organisation and human resources.

In 2006, the school assumed its current name and established a partnership program with Fudan University School of Management. The following year, the four doctoral courses were brought together in a single course, completely in English.

In 2013, the Luiss Business School was included in the new *Luiss School of Business & Management* educational area, together with the Luiss Business & Management Department. In 2015, it obtained the EQUIS accreditation, becoming the third Italian university to obtain this accreditation.

In 2016, the reorganisation of the educational area was completed, with the merging of the Business School and Business & Management Department activities in the new "Luiss Business School". Starting from 9 January 2017, the School moved to its new seat, the recently renovated 19th-century Villa Blanc.

In 2020, Luiss Business School obtained the AMBA accreditation, becoming the fourth Italian university to obtain this accreditation.

In 2023, 27 July, Luiss Business School received the AACSB accreditation, joining triple-accredited business schools worldwide.
