# Thomas Nixon Carver



**Thomas Nixon Carver** (25 March 1865 – 8 March 1961) was an American economics professor.


## Early life

He grew up on a farm, the son of Quaker parents. He received an undergraduate education at Iowa Wesleyan College and the University of Southern California. After studying under John Bates Clark and Richard T. Ely at Johns Hopkins University, he received a PhD degree at Cornell University under Walter Francis Willcox in 1894.


## Career

He held a joint appointment in economics and sociology at Oberlin College until 1902, when he accepted a position as professor of political economy at Harvard University (1902–1935). For a time, there he taught the only course in sociology. He was the secretary-treasurer of the American Economic Association (1909–1913) and was elected its president in 1916.

Carver's principal achievement in economic theory was to extend Clark's theory of marginalism to determination of interest from saving ('abstinence') and productivity of capital. He made pioneering contributions to agricultural and rural economics and in rural sociology. He wrote on such diverse topics as monetary economics, macroeconomics, the distribution of wealth, the problem of evil, uses of religion, political science, political economy, social justice, behavioral economics, social evolution, and the economics of national survival.
