Casa Ley


# Casa Ley



**Casa Ley** is a Mexican grocery store chain based in Culiacán founded in 1954 by Juan Ley Fong. Most of its stores are located in western Mexico, in the states of Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Coahuila, Durango, Guanajuato, and Baja California Sur. It is Mexico's largest privately held supermarket chain. For years, 49% of the chain was owned by American supermarket chain Safeway Inc., which later went to Albertsons Companies, Inc. after it acquired Safeway in 2015. In 2018, Albertsons divested its 49% share to Tenedora CL del Noroeste, ending the company's international operations.


## History

The company originally started as a small village shop in the mining town of Tayoltita, where Ley offered his goods to the gold and silver miners of the San Luis Mining Company. In 1948, a theft by a close friend and colleague forced Ley to eventually close his shop and leave the town, in search of a new location. The family moved to Culiacán, and in September 1954 the company Casa Ley was born.
