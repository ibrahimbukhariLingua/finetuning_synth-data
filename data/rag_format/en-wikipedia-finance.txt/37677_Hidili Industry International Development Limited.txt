## History

Before being listing in Hong Kong Stock Exchange, there was an advertisement in a Hong Kong newspaper, which claimed to sell Hidili's stocks to the public personally. Hidili later denied this advertisement. But according to Hong Kong law, it is illegal to sell the stocks of unlisted companies.

Hidili was listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 21 September 2007. The closed price on the first trading day was HK$12.12, which was 77% greater than its IPO price, HK$6.83, but it reached about 150 P/E ratio.

On 16 October 2007, the **Baring Private Equity Asia III Holding (5A) Limited**, one of the shareholders which held 11% of Hidili shares, announced to sell all shares at the price between HK$13.58 and HK$14.32 via UBS. There were some worries that the share price was abnormally high currently.
