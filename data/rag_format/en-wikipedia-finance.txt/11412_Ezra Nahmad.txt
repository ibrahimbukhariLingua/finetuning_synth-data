## Biography

Ezra was born in Beirut, Lebanon to a Sephardic Jewish family. The roots of the Nahmad family are in Aleppo, Syria, where his father, banker Hillel Nahmad lived until just after World War II. Following the Syrian anti-Jewish violence in 1949, his father moved to Beirut, where Ezra and his brothers sold English novels to US sailors stationed there. In the early 1960s, With the rise of Israeli threat against the Lebanese Republic, Ezra's father took him and his brothers, Joseph (Giuseppe) and David, to Milan, Italy. As teenagers, the three began to deal in art, and skipped school to trade on the Italian stock market.

Ezra's first career milestone is believed to have taken place at a Juan Gris exhibition in Rome, organized by cubist dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Ezra and his brother bought two works – the only pieces sold. Kahnweiler befriended them, selling them works by Picasso, Braque, and Gris. With the emergence of the Red Brigades terror group in the 1970s, Milan was perceived as too dangerous, and the family moved again.
