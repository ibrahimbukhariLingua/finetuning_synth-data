# BitGive Foundation



The **BitGive Foundation** is an American nonprofit organization that solicits bitcoin donations for use in charitable causes.


## Background

BitGive was established by Connie Gallippi in 2013. The organization was the first Bitcoin and Blockchain technology nonprofit. The organization has received 501(c)(3) tax exempt status from the United States Internal Revenue Service.

BitGive was founded with the goal of strengthening philanthropic impact globally by using cryptocurrency to make the process faster and more secure. On GiveTrack, nonprofits can post projects and donors can contribute funds. Contributions can be made in bitcoin or in dollars. The platform gives donors financial reporting and project results in real time.

In 2017–2018, BitGive received $1 million from the Pineapple Fund, a philanthropic endeavor by an anonymous donor known as “Pine,” who sought to donate “the majority of [their] bitcoins to charitable causes.”
