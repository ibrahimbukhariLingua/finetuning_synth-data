## History

The beginning of large-scale development of electric power in Western Ukraine was the construction of Dobrotvirska TES. From 1951 to 1959, 25 MW, 50 MW, 100 MW and two 150 MW power units were put into operation at the station. The formation of Western Ukrainian energy took place as part of BEO Lvivenergo, which united TESs, regional enterprises of electric networks (with main and distribution networks), and energy repair enterprises. The main direction of development was to increase the unit capacity and improve the efficiency of equipment.

In 1962-1969 Burshtyn TES with 200 MW power units was put into operation.

Lvivenergo became the first company of the former USSR to build and operate a nuclear power plant – Rivne NPP, the first power unit of which was introduced in December 1979.

OJSC "Zakhidenergo" was established in 1995, in accordance with the Presidential Decree of 04.04.95 № 282 "On structural adjustment in the power complex of Ukraine", on the basis of thermal power plants BEO "Lvivenergo" – Burshtyn and Dobrotvirska TES, as well as Ladyzhyn TES, which was a part of BEO "Vinnytsiaenergo". OJSC "Zahidenergo" has inherited the high technical level of BEO and the most qualified personnel.
