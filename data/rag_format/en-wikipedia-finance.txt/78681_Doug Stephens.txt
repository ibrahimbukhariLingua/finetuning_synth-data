## The Retail Revival

In 2013 Stephens authored the book *The Retail Revival: Reimagining Business For The New Age of Consumerism*. The book presents the case that the unique social and economic conditions leading to unimaginable growth in the retail and consumer goods sectors through the latter part of the twentieth century are giving way to radically altered demographic, economic and technological realities, yielding a new, more demanding yet vastly more positive and sustainable retail landscape.


## Reengineering Retail

In 2017 Stephens authored his second book "Reengineering Retail: The Future of Selling in a Post-Digital World". The book examines the rapid evolution of ecommerce and changing role of physical retail spaces in the future. The book also forecasts a new future economic model for the retail industry.


## Resurrecting Retail

In 2021 Stephens authored his third book "Resurrecting Retail: The Future of Business in a Post-Pandemic World". The book explores the impact of the pandemic on the global retail industry and consumer behavior as well as documents historic changes in the competitive landscape brought on by the crisis and the new competitive challenges and opportunities it catalyzed.
