Christian Business Faculty Association


# Christian Business Faculty Association



The **Christian Business Faculty Association** (**CBFA**) is an organization created in the United States in the 1990s to further Christian education in colleges and universities. As of 2009 the organization had a total of 400 Christian business faculty members currently employed at colleges and universities.
The CBFA holds an annual conference of American and international Christian business faculty. The CBFA offers programs for college students and faculty to be able to travel overseas and study abroad.

The CBFA is led by an eleven-member board. Seven of the board positions are elected by the membership. Each year, two new members of the board are elected at the annual conference for a three-year term. After his or her first year on the board, one of those individuals is chosen to become the vice-chair/chair-elect of the board; that person then becomes the chair of the board, and then serves an additional year as the immediate past chair. The year in which each board member's term ends is given in parentheses.

Four board positions are appointed by the elected members of the board: the secretary, the treasurer, the senior editor, and the program chair


## History

The association began in April, 1980 when the leaders of the American Studies Program and the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (then known as the Christian College Coalition) organized a meeting of 12-15 business professors from member schools in Washington, D.C.
The group kept growing every year. Over 40 professors attended the year after in Washington, D.C. Also Regional conferences started at several member schools in 1982 and 1983. In 1984 over 70 faculty attended a convention at Seattle Pacific University on business ethics sponsored by the CCCU with a grant from the Murdock Foundation. The convention created friendships and interest that pushed the professors to have more meetings. In 1987, the association appointed a steering committee with regional representatives that decided to increments services to the membership, and the creation of a regular newsletter.
