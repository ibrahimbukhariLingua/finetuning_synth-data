Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines


# Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines



**Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines** is a UK-based, Norwegian-owned cruise shipping line with three cruise ships. The company is owned by Bonheur and is headquartered in Ipswich, Suffolk, in the United Kingdom. The company is part of the Fred. Olsen Group.


## History

The company originated in Hvitsten, a small town on Oslofjord in Norway, in 1848 by three Olsen brothers, Fredrik Christian, Petter and Andras, who bought their first ships and began an international shipping company. The company is now into the fifth generation of the family and operates various companies skilled within the cruise and passenger shipping trade, as well as aviation, ships' crewing, ship building and offshore industries. The Fred. Olsen group also has business interests in the luxury hotel sector, estate management, property development and electronics companies.

In May 2006 Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines announced the purchase of a new vessel, *Norwegian Crown*, from Norwegian Cruise Line. Following delivery of the vessel in November 2007, she was dry-docked for refurbishment. She was renamed *Balmoral* and entered service early in 2008. This was followed by a new centre section being added, with new cabins and public rooms, increasing the size from 19,000 GT to 24,000 GT (approx).

In 2018 Fred. Olsen announced that a series of 600-passenger-newbuilts was being planned and they were in negotiations with shipyards, but those newbuilts were never ordered.

In July 2020, Fred. Olsen bought the former Holland America Line ships Amsterdam and Rotterdam for $37m and renamed them Bolette and Borealis respectively, to be delivered in September 2020. They replaced the *Boudicca* and the *Black Watch* which were retired in August 2020.
