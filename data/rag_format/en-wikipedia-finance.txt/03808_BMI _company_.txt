## History

BMI Research was founded in 1984 as Business Monitor International by Richard Londesborough and Jonathan Feroze with an initial focus on Latin America. By 1994 it was producing 10 monitor newsletters and 25 business forecast reports.

In 1997, the company (then known as Business Monitor International) won the Queen's Award for export.

International office expansion began in 2008 with Singapore, followed in 2009 by New York, and in 2010 with Pretoria. In 2012, the company acquired Espicom Business Intelligence, "a UK-based company with a 30-year pedigree providing business intelligence on Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare and Therapeutics across global markets".

On September 9, 2009, the company "received a substantial, non-controlling equity investment from Spectrum Equity Investors", which the private equity firm held until March 14, 2014, when Fitch Group announced that it had acquired the company (then still called Business Monitor International). In June, 2014, Richard Hall
was appointed as CEO, and the firm re-branded as BMI Research in March, 2015. Richard Hall left the company in October 2015.

On July 30, 2018, BMI Research was integrated into Fitch Solutions as Fitch Solutions Macro Research.
