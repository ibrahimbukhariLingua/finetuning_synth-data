In April 2001, Roc Oil Company made a friendly unsolicited offer to acquire 40% of Gulfstream Resources Canada. The offer was valued at C$28.3 million, however was rejected by the Gulfstream.

To further fuel the next stage of Roc Oil Company's growth Strategy, Roc Oil raised $92 million through a 3 for 5 share rights issue.

Following this capital raise in April, In December Roc Oil announced the sale of 100% of the subsidiary which owned the Saltfleetby Gas Field (acquired in 1999) for $110 million. The sale was estimated to earn Roc Oil 28.5 million pounds after tax profit for 2005. The buyer of the subsidiary was Wingas, a joint venture between Wintershall as well as OAO Gazprom (Russian gas company and one of the largest in the world). The funds earned from the sale will be used to finance ROC's development of the Chinguetti Oil Field, offshore Mauritania and the Cliff Head Oil Field, Offshore Western Australia and other ventures ROC was planning to explore.

In June, ROC began further expanding its presence in Asia by planning to make a move to acquire a 24.5% stake in a China Oil Field off Apache (hydrocarbon explorer).

To refine ROC's focus in terms of geographic operations, the company was planning on selling off its North Sea and Africa assets. ROC had a 12.5% stake in the Blane Oil Field (Located in the North Sea) and because of drilling uncovering mostly dry wells, CEO Bruce Clements stated the company will aim to sell off these assets in order to refocus ROC's efforts in currently occupied territories including Asia and Australia.

ROC became interested in taking over a local crude oil producer in Australia, Anzon. The acquisition would double ROC's crude oil reserves, with ROC having already taken control of 69% of the company and the CEO at the time confident in the offer stating "the deal will happen". In September, the shareholders of the UK located Anzon Energy approved of the $600 million merger with ROC Oil. The merger granted ROC control of 53.1% stake of Anzon Australia.

As well, the new entity would be able to produce between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil a day approximately until 2030.

However, before the merger process was completed with Horizon, Transcendent Resources (a subsidiary of Fosun International) sent an off-market takeover bid for ROC Oil Company. Subsequently, ROC accepted the offer by Transcendent Resources, stating it offered better synergies and benefits to the be created group over the deal proposed by Horizon as well as offered a better premium over the share price. The ROC Oil Chairman Mike Harding stated, "the proposal to purchase all of ROC's shares for cash is superior when considered against the alternative merger of equals with Horizon and offers a significant premium to share price performance". The final offer by Fosun was A$474 million, paying A$0.69 per ROC Oil Company share, at the time being a 10 percent premium to the current share price and a 23 percent premium to the price prior to the announcement of the offer. Fosun commented on their rationale behind the transaction saying "to enable the group to enter the upstream oil & gas industry and acquire oil & gas assets."

In 2006 ROC commenced drilling a side-track appraisal well in the Beibu Gulf region, off shore China. in preliminary tests the discovery well unearthed a combined 5,700 b/d of oil from three columns.

ROC Oil continued mining operations in the Beibu Gulf in 2014, drilling two exploration wells finding oil in one of the two wells. The wells were drilled to a depth of 1406 metres, "where the basement granite has been intersected". ROC further drilled a side track to an aggregate depth of 1,265 metres which further confirmed the presence of oil in the very top of the Jiaowei formation. ROC CEO, Alan Linn said the "discovery adds potentially valuable incremental oil to the larger project". The wells were plugged and abandoned on 27 September 2014.


### Australia


### Perth

In 2007, ROC made a discovery of oil and gas at its Dunsborough well in an offshore Perth Basin which is 37.5% owned by ROC. The Dunsborough well was the third and final well the program which commenced in April 2007. The first well, Frankland discovered gas and the second, Perseverance too discovered gas.

The Frankland well, the first well of the operation located offshore Perth was shortly plugged and abandoned, labelled as a small gas discovery. This was done in support of the companies strategy to target oil. Additionally, the company also said "whether or not an associated oil log is present needs to be evaluated and if an oil leg exists, it is likely to be small".


### Canning Basin

ROC Oil has current operations still in Western Australia, in the canning basin located in the northern region of WA being the Ungani Oil Field. the field is owned 50/50 by Roc Oil Company and Buru Energy Limited and is a producer of oil. the field produces approximately 850 bopd gross crude oil from a total of five wells, This oil is exported to a terminal in Wyndham and stored as well as exported by ship.

ROC gained a 45% interest in the onshore block, where more than 4.5 billion barrels (bbl) have already been discovered during the last 40 years. In 2008 the fifth well, Coco discovered oil and associated gas during a test.

However, in later 2008 in October, ROC plugged and abandoned the first appraisal well in Angola. The project was less successful than anticipated, with the five of the seven wells in the drilling program failing to find commercial quantities of oil. While the company did abandon the well, it was announced that the company would plan to re-enter the Angola project, specifically the Coco well in order to test and find oil in the future.
