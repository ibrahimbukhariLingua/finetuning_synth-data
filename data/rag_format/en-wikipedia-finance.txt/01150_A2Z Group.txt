## History

Later, in 2008, it entered the engineering, procurement, and construction and EPC contract business. The EPC business expanded with the acquisition and merger of Sri Eswara Sai Construction Private Limited, a company that installed transmission lines, in January 2008. A2Z later transferred its FMS business to its wholly owned subsidiary, A2Z Infraservices in the same year according to a court-approved scheme of demerger. In August 2009 A2Z acquired Imatek from the same FMS industry.

In May 2010, A2Z's EPC business signed a contract to purchase the entire business of Surendra Choudhary & Brothers, a partnership that constructed electrical substations and did railway electrification work.
