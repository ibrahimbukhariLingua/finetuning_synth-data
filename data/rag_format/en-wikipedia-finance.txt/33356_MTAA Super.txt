## Read The Signs

Read The Signs is a join initiative between Lifeline Australia and MTAA Super. This program is aimed at promoting suicide prevention among MTAA Super members. Launched in September 2004, Read The Signs was a result of the concern at the numbers of suicide deaths in Australia. Statistics indicate that suicides account for 25% of all deaths amongst young male Australians between the ages of 15 and 24.
