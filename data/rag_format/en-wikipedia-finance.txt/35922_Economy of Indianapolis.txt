The **economy of Indianapolis** is centered on the City of Indianapolis and Marion County within the context of the larger Indianapolis metropolitan area. The Indianapolis–Carmel–Anderson, IN MSA, had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $134 billion in 2015. The top five industries were: finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing ($30.7B), manufacturing ($30.1B), professional and business services ($14.3B), educational services, health care, and social assistance ($10.8B), and wholesale trade ($8.1B). Government, if it had been a private industry, would have ranked fifth, generating $10.2 billion.

Compared to Indiana as a whole, the Indianapolis metropolitan area has a lower proportion of manufacturing jobs and a higher concentration of jobs in wholesale trade; administrative, support, and waste management; professional, scientific, and technical services; and transportation and warehousing. The city's major exports include pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle parts, medical equipment and supplies, engine and power equipment, and aircraft products and parts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the region's unemployment rate was 2.8 percent in May 2019.

In 2021, the Indianapolis metropolitan area was home to three Fortune 500 companies and six Fortune 1000 companies. The largest public companies based in the area were insurance company Elevance Health, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, agrochemical company Corteva, real estate investment trust Simon Property Group, pharmaceutical (animal health) company Elanco, financial services company CNO Financial Group, specialty chemicals company Calumet, Inc., automotive components manufacturer Allison Transmission, and automotive remarketing company OpenLane. Private companies based in the area include financial services company OneAmerica Financial, agricultural cooperative CountryMark, and regional airline Republic Airways Holdings.


## History


### Notable bids

In 1991, United Airlines selected Indianapolis International Airport for a $1 billion (equivalent to $2.11 billion in 2023) maintenance operations center after a competitive bidding process involving more than 90 cities. State and local officials agreed to subsidize United's costs by providing nearly $300 million (equivalent to $632.76 million in 2023) in tax credits and other incentives in exchange for thousands of high-wage jobs by 2004. Following United's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002, the 1.7 million square foot (160,000 m²) Indianapolis Maintenance Center closed in 2003. According to the *Indianapolis Business Journal*, "records are hard to come by, but during United's glory days, it is believed to have employed as many as 3,000 people at IMC [Indianapolis Maintenance Center]"—short of the 6,300 jobs United committed to in 1991.

Indianapolis submitted a bid to lure Amazon's HQ2 in 2017. In 2018, the company shortlisted Indianapolis as one of 20 finalists from a pool of 238 bids.
