## Commercial proceedings

After 3.5 years of trial, on 2 October 2019, the Shevchenko Court of Kyiv ordered to collect ₴1.5 billion from Zhevago in favor of the National Bank of Ukraine. The decision explains that Kostyantyn Zhevago did not want to fulfill his obligations under the surety agreement to repay the bank's refinancing loans. On 13 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal returned Zhevago's appeal without consideration due to non-payment of the court fee within the specified time frame, after which the court's decision on compulsory collection entered into force.

On 3 December, Zhevago was declared an international wanted man and permission was granted for his detention.


## Criminal proceedings

In the summer of 2019, when the active phase of the parliamentary elections campaign began in Ukraine, on the day Zhevago registered as a candidate for People's Deputy of Ukraine, criminal proceedings were opened against him regarding his possible involvement in embezzlement of ₴2.5 billion. The State Bureau of Investigation summoned Kostyantyn Zhevago for questioning on 27 September 2019. According to the inspection data of the Deposit Guarantee Fund, Zhevago and another top manager of the Finance and Credit bank allegedly issued several deliberately bad loans in the amount of almost ₴5 billion in order to get hold of the money.
This case has been carried to date and has not been trialed for more than 5 years. In addition, according to Zhevago's lawyers, the State Bureau of Investigation has not provided any information regarding this criminal case for many years, which violates his and other accused managers constitutional rights to a fair trial.

According to the investigation, in 2007-2014, the offshore company opened several credit lines in foreign banks. Pledge agreements in the amount of $113 million were concluded between the Finance and Credit Bank and foreign banks. The Ukrainian bank vouched for the offshore company with its own funds on accounts in foreign creditor banks. In 2015, foreign banks charged $113 million from the accounts of the Finance and Credit bank for non-fulfillment of obligations by the offshore company under contracts. The collateral was written off when the bank Finance and Credit was declared insolvent. The investigation into this case has not been suspended for more than 5 years, and has not been trialed for the same period.

On 27 December 2022, Zhevago was detained in Courchevel, France at the request of Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation. On 29 December 2022, the French court of Chambéry ordered the extradition arrest of Zhevago, he was notified of the suspicion of committing criminal offenses provided for in Part 3 of Art. 27, Part 5 of Art. 191, Part 3 of Art. 209 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Some top managers of the Bank "Finance and Credit" are also suspected. This criminal case has not been trialed for over 5 years.

In March 2023, the Court in the French city of Chambery rejected the Ukrainian side's request for the extradition of Kostyantyn Zhevago, and on 10 November 2023, the Supreme Court of France rejected the Ukrainian appeal and ruled that Zhevago was not subject to extradition because Ukraine could not guarantee that Zhevago's case would be considered by an independent court. All restrictions on Zhevago were lifted.

In May 2024, Zhevago received a new suspicion of withdrawing UAH 519 million from the Finance and Credit bank in collusion with two deputies. This new criminal case is the case materials from September 2019 and has not been trialed for more than 5 years. According to the investigation, in 2007-2010, Zhevago created a criminal organization, which included the chairman, members of the board of the Finance and Credit bank and other persons close to him. A company controlled by Zhevago received a loan from the bank in violation of the rules, and then the money was subsequently withdrawn to offshore accounts. All these accusations are unfounded according to Zhevago's lawyers, and the specified loans have been repeatedly checked by the NBU (Ukrainian Regulator) for more than 7 years and no violations were detected in accordance with these loans.

Zhevago has been named as the party who allegedly bribed the Chair Person of the Ukraine Supreme Court Vsevolod Kniaziev in 2023. On 10 July 2024, the court chose Zhevago in absentia as a preventive measure in the form of detention. Zhevago himself was in France at the time of the crime and at the beginning of the investigation, and denies any involvement in this case stating that the accusation is politically motivated.

In 2025, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy imposed sanctions on multiple oligarchs and individuals including Zhevago on suspicion of "high treason" and assisting a terrorist organization, particularly their role in compromising national security through unfavorable business agreements with Russia. The next day, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office announced the opening of criminal investigations against him and other sanctioned individuals.
