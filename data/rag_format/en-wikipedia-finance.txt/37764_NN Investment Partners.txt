## History

The company was created under the name of ING Investment Management in 1994, when parent company NN Group was part of bank and insurance company ING Group. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, ING was required to divest its insurance activities and the asset management division. NN Group, the combination of the two businesses, was listed on Euronext Amsterdam in 2014. The following year, ING Investment Management was rebranded as NN Investment Partners.

In 2022 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc acquired NN Investment Partners from NN Group N.V. for €1.7 billion.

On 6 March 2023, the legal entity NN Investment Partners B.V. ceased to exist and was incorporated into Goldman Sachs Asset Management.


## Responsible Investment Policy

In 2019, NN IP published its first Responsible Investing Report, in which it provides insights into how it integrates environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into its investment processes. According to the report a set of ESG criteria is applied to 67% of its total assets under management.

NN IP generally pursues active engagement with potentially controversial companies to help them improve their ESG profiles. One example cited by NN IP is the palm oil industry. Engagements with several large plantation companies have resulted in progress on encouraging them to pursue a more sustainable policy. In 2019, NN IP became a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

In a limited number of cases, the company has divested it holdings in sectors deemed detrimental to society and/or the planet. Excluded business activities include adult entertainment, arctic drilling, fur & specialty leather, gambling, nuclear energy, shale oil & gas and weapons.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
