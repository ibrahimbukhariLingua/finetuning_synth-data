## History


### Pre-IPO (2004–2012)

Demandware was founded in February 2004 by Stephan Schambach to provide a hosted service that would enable companies to develop and manage e-commerce websites, rather than building a site from scratch. The service was launched in the first quarter of 2005. Schambach previously founded the early e-commerce company Intershop in 1992. Seed money for Demandware was provided by venture capital firms General Catalyst Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners.


### Post-IPO (2012–present)

On March 15, 2012, Demandware began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, raising $88 million in its initial public offering of $16 per share. Following its IPO, shares were up more than 50% from the IPO price by the next morning. In November 2013, Demandware announced an underwritten registered public offering.
