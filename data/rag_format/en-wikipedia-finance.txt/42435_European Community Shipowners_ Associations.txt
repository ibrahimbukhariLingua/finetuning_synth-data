## The European shipping industry

The European shipping industry controls 39.5% of the global merchant fleet. This amounts to 810 million deadweight tonnes or 550 million gross tonnes and 23,400 vessels.

Shipping is a valuable economic and geopolitical asset of the European Union. In 2018, it delivered €54 billion to the EU's GDP. This translates into €78,000 GDP per worker, compared to the EU average of €63,000. Its direct economic impact is significant, with 685,000 persons employed in both sea- and land-based jobs in the same year. Taking into consideration the indirect and induced impacts, the total economic impact of European shipping amounts to €149 billion and 2 million jobs. For every €1 million GDP the European shipping industry creates, another €1.8 million is supported elsewhere in the EU economy.
