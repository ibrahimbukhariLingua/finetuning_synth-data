Government Actuary's Department


# Government Actuary's Department



The **Government Actuary's Department** (GAD) provides actuarial solutions including risk analysis, modelling and advice to support the UK public sector. It is a department of the Government of the United Kingdom.


## History

In 1912 the Government appointed a chief actuary to the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, following the Old Age Pensions Act 1908 and the National Insurance Act 1911. As the role of the Chief Actuary expanded, the post of Government Actuary was created in 1917. The Government Actuary's Department was formed 2 years later.

The role of GAD within government expanded significantly in the 1940s and 1950s, coinciding with an expansion of the state's role in pensions, social security and health care.

By the 1980s GAD had grown into a significant actuarial consultancy within government and in 1989 the financing of GAD through an annual Parliamentary vote of funds was replaced by a system of directly charging users of GAD's services. The calculation of GAD's fees is based solely on the recovery of its costs.

GAD has about 200 people across 2 offices (London and Edinburgh), of whom around 165 are actuaries and analysts.
