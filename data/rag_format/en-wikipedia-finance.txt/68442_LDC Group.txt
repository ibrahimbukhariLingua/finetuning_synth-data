The company was founded in 1968 as a merger of the family business *Lambert* based in Sablé-sur-Sarthe and *Dodard-Chancereul* based in Saint-Denis-d’Anjou. In 1970, the company expanded and opened a poultry slaughterhouse in Sablé-sur-Sarthe.

Among others, the company took over the Polish company *Drosed* in 2000, the Hungarian *Tranzit* group in 2018, and the British poultry company *Capestone Organic Poultry* in 2021.
