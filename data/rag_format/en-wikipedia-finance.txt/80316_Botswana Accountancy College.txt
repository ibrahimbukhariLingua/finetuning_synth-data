Botswana Accountancy College


# Botswana Accountancy College



The **Botswana Accountancy College**, also known as **BAC**, is a business school which is headquartered in the city of Gaborone, Botswana. Initially funded and established through a joint venture between the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning and Debswana, the college caters for the accountancy and information technology tertiary needs of the country. The Botswana Accountancy College asserts itself as the center of excellence in Southern Africa and beyond. It specializes in areas of accounting, finance, business, management, hospitality, taxation, leisure, and ICT. BAC has two campuses; the main campus is in Gaborone, and the other in Francistown. The Gaborone Campus is located in the Fairgrounds Office Park of south-east Gaborone.

The college has collaborations with The University of Derby, the University of Sunderland and Sheffield Hallam University in England.


## History

The college was established in 1996 as a joint venture between the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), the Debswana Diamond Company, and the Botswana Institute of Accountants, enrolling about 349 ACCA, CIMA, AAT and NCC diploma students. Botswana Accountancy College also offers undergraduate programs that are accredited by the University of Derby. The objectives of the college were to reduce the reliance on expatriate accountants and, in the long term, to be a self-funding project. BAC is a company limited by guarantee with three sponsors as the shareholders. The MFDP and Debswana funded BAC until 2007. The Gaborone Campus is located in the Fairgrounds Office Park of south-east Gaborone.
