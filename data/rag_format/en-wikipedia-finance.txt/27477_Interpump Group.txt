# Interpump Group



**Interpump Group S.p.A.** is an Italian company specialized in the production of high and very high pressure water pumps and one of the world's leading groups in the hydraulic sector.

It is listed in the FTSE Italia Mid Cap and FTSE Italia STAR index of the Borsa Italiana.


## History

The company was founded in 1977 in the province of Reggio Emilia, in Sant'Ilario d'Enza. Initially production was linked to high pressure pumps and pistons characterized by small dimensions and new type materials that led the company to hold 50% of the market in a few years.

Since the 90s it has begun to expand the areas of interest by acquiring other companies in the sector of professional cleaning machines and electric motors.

In 1996 it was listed on the stock exchange and from the following year it began to enter the hydraulic sector with targeted acquisitions of companies in the sector.

In 2005 the branch relating to professional cleaning machines was sold following a repositioning in the most technological sectors.
