**GOAT Group** is a holding company that operates e-commerce platforms for sneakers, apparel, and accessories. Formed in 2018, it operates the online platform GOAT, Flight Club, alias, and Grailed.


## History

GOAT Group's origins date back to 2015 with the founding of the online sneaker platform GOAT. In 2018, GOAT acquired retail sneaker consignment company Flight Club. GOAT and Flight Club continued to operate as two separate brands and led to the creation of GOAT Group. The acquisition was followed by a $100 million investment from Foot Locker in 2019.

In 2020, GOAT Group launched Alias (styled "alias"), an online platform that allows users to list their own sneakers and apparel for resale. By 2021, GOAT Group was valued at $3.7 billion dollars after it received an additional $195 million private investment in the company. In 2022, GOAT Group purchased Grailed, an online peer-to-peer marketplace for apparel, accessories, and footwear.
