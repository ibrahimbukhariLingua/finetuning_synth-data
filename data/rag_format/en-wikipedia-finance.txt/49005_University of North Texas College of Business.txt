# University of North Texas College of Business



The **University of North Texas College of Business** is a constituent college of the University of North Texas in Denton. It is organized into five academic departments — (i) Accounting, (ii) Finance, Insurance, Real Estate & Law (FIREL), (iii) Information Technology & Decision Sciences, (iv) Management, and (v) Marketing & Logistics. The College also has six interdisciplinary centers — (a) the Center for NAFTA Studies, (b) the Information Systems Research Center, (c) the Institute of Petroleum Accounting, (d) the Murphy Center for Entrepreneurship (e) the Professional Leadership Program, and (f) the Center for Logistics Education & Research. The college awards Bachelors, Masters, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees.


## Research centers & professional institute

The college is host to three research centers, one applied academics center, and one institute:

1. Center for Decision and Information Technologies is a partnership among the university, industry, and other universities that focus on information technology management, education, and research.
2. Institute of Petroleum Accounting, which was founded 44 years ago.
3. Murphy Center for Entrepreneurship, which is in its twenty-fourth year
4. Center for Logistics Education and Research partners with industry to innovate and structure advanced logistics and supply chains in Texas and around the globe
5. Professional Development Institute is an educational enterprise founded fifty-one years ago within the College of Business and, in December 1982, restructured as a non-profit, tax exempt Texas corporation. A component of its mission is to provide continuing education required for professional certifications such as the CPA. PDI draws upon scholars and adjunct industry practitioners to provide training in subjects that include petroleum accounting, professional accounting, insurance, information systems, finance, and management. As an example of PDI's reach in the past, in 1983, it sponsored 436 programs in 93 cities in 31 states and six countries. PDI was the impetus for erecting a Sheraton hotel and conference center in 1985 through a lease on the site of the university's golf course clubhouse. The university took over the lease from Radisson and demolished the structure in 2009 to make way for a new, larger conference center. As of 2010, CPE courses — which historically have accounted for much of PDI's enrollment — have been offered online.

The College of Business is accredited in business and accounting by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. In 1961, its undergraduate business program received AACSB accreditation. In the spring of 1964, the Master of Business program received AACSB accreditation. At that time, about seventy-five MBA programs in the country and one other in the state — The University of Texas at Austin — was accredited by the AACSB.

Also at that time (1964), the College of Business was second in the state and the southwest, next to the University of Texas at Austin, and 11th in the nation, with the University of Southern California, in number of bachelor's degrees conferred.

The College of Business began its first PhD program fifty-nine years ago — in the fall of 1965.
