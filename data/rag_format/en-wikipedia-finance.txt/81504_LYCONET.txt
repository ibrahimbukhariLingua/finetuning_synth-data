LYCONET


# LYCONET




**LYCONET** is an international network marketing company. From its headquarters in Graz, Austria, it operates in over 50 countries across the globe.


## General overview

LYCONET works in partnership with myWorld International AG to advance a Benefit Program. This program enables customers to accrue rewards such as cashback and shopping points when they make purchases through the network of merchants affiliated with myWorld. To expand its reach and effectiveness, LYCONET collaborates with independent business professionals, known as Lyconet Marketers. These marketers are responsible for bringing in new customers and merchants. Their activities include recommending products and services available through the myWorld Benefit Program. As part of this collaboration, the marketers receive commissions. These commissions are structured to reflect the level of sales and engagement they achieve within the program, offering a form of compensation for their efforts in promoting and growing the myWorld network and its offerings.


## History

The origins of LYCONET go back to the Lyoness shopping community, which was founded in 2003. Lyoness formed partnerships with retailers to offer purchasing benefits to its members.

In 2014, to differentiate its consumer and business loyalty programs from its sales division, Lyoness restructured, retaining its core services under the shopping brand “Lyoness” (which was later relaunched under the names Cashback World and myWorld) and introducing "Lyconet" as its sales-focused brand.

By 2018, Lyconet became a distinct entity as "Lyconet Austria GmbH."

LYCONET collaborates with myWorld International AG to promote a Benefit Program, wherein customers earn benefits like Cashback and Shopping Points from purchases made through myWorld’s associated merchants. Lyconet partners with independent entrepreneurs, referred to as Lyconet Marketers. These marketers onboard new customers and merchants, recommending products and services of the myWorld Benefit Program. In return, they gain commissions based on the sales they facilitate.
