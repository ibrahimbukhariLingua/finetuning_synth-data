Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008


# Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008



The United States **Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008** (commonly referred to as **HERA**) was designed primarily to address the subprime mortgage crisis. It authorized the Federal Housing Administration to guarantee up to $300 billion in new 30-year fixed rate mortgages for subprime borrowers if lenders wrote down principal loan balances to 90 percent of current appraisal value. It was intended to restore confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by strengthening regulations and injecting capital into the two large U.S. suppliers of mortgage funding. States are authorized to refinance subprime loans using mortgage revenue bonds. Enactment of the Act led to the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.


## Legislative history

The Act was passed by the United States Congress on July 24, 2008 and signed by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2008.


### Subsequent amendments

Some provisions of the law were modified by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009.


## Federal Housing Finance Agency

The Act also established the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) out of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO).

Through the powers granted to FHFA, created by the Act, on September 7, 2008, FHFA director James B. Lockhart III announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. The action is "one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades".

Congress began hearings on the program in February.

### Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008

"Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act" (12 United States Code, Section 5100, *et seq.*), passed by Congress and signed by President G.W. Bush in 2008, required all states to implement a Mortgage Loan Originator (MLO) licensing and registration system by August 1, 2009 (August 1, 2010 for legislatures that meet biennially). States can operate their own systems, subject to stringent federal standards, or they can participate in the Nationwide Multi-State Licensing System and Registry (NMLS), a service operated jointly by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators (CSBS/AARMR). If the state's licensing and registration program does not meet minimum standards at any time, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is empowered to step in and impose a compliant system upon the state.

The objectives of the SAFE Act include aggregating and improving the flow of information to and between regulators; providing increased accountability and tracking of MLOs; enhancing consumer protections; supporting anti-fraud measures; and providing consumers with easily accessible information at no charge regarding the employment history of and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against MLOs.

Upon registration, MLOs are provided with a Unique Identifier number. All MLOs and their employers are required to provide this unique identifier to anyone who requests it, and the federally chartered mortgage institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, require that it be placed on all loan documents for loans that they purchase. Consumers will be able to use this number to obtain basic information on any registered MLO. This information includes name and aliases, employment history, current employment and contact information, negative civil judgments or settlements, and disciplinary and criminal history.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The Act and the implementing regulations, which were issued jointly by the federal banking agencies in 2010, define a "mortgage loan originator" as any individual who *both* takes residential loan applications *and* "offers or negotiates" residential mortgage loan terms. Additionally, the individual must undertake these activities for economic gain (*i.e.*, get paid for it). Persons who perform merely clerical or administrative tasks in connection with loan origination are not considered MLOs. The terms, "taking a mortgage loan application" and "offering or negotiating terms" are defined very broadly so that just about any person in the underwriting process who has more than cursory contact with a potential borrower is an MLO. Mortgage loans include financing and refinancing transactions, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and just about any other credit transaction secured by a first or junior lien on a dwelling.

Not all persons who qualify as MLOs are required to become licensed or to register with the newly renamed Nationwide Multi-State Licensing System and Registry (NMLS). Licensed Realtors and MLOs who work for federally regulated financial institutions, for example, are not required to be licensed as MLOs, although they are required to register. Those who would otherwise be required to register are exempted if they have:

1. Never been registered before and,
2. Perform five or fewer mortgage loan originations in any rolling twelve-month period.

Registration must be renewed annually, and registrants must submit fingerprints for a criminal background check along with their first registration application.
