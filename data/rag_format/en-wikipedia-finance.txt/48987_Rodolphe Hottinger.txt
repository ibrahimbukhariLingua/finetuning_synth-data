## Philosophy

Rodolphe Hottinger remains inspired by a speech given by his grandfather, Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer (1902-1985), as Chairman of the EC Banking Federation, at the inaugural meeting of Bankers' Day in Munich on 14 November 1963.

> The example of the past should allow for the pursuit of this ancestral occupation of banking. To qualify it, to define it, to anticipate what it might become: therein lies the secret of its future. In the conduct of its forebears and the example they set, our banking family will receive the encouragement to persevere, the intelligence to change and adapt, the character to overcome challenges, and the hope to undertake new ventures.
