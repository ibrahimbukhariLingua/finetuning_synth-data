## History

eCapital, originally established as Global Merchant Fund Corp. in 2006 by Steve McDonald, began its operations by acquiring underperforming loans from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), along with other banks and loan funds.

In 2017, Global Merchant Fund Corp. expanded by acquiring Gerber Finance, a company that finances importers, distributors, manufacturers, and service providers. The following year, 2018, saw the acquisition of Paragon Financial Group, a firm specializing in accounts receivable financing, credit protection, non-recourse invoice factoring, purchase order financing, and vendor guarantees.

In 2019, Global Merchant Fund Corporation acquired Accutrac Capital, a company active in freight factoring, a sub-sector of transportation market. Subsequently, through Accutrac Capital, the company acquired eCapital, a U.S.-based transportation factoring company.

In 2020, Global Merchant Fund Corp. underwent rebranding to become eCapital and consolidated its various acquisitions. In the same year, the acquisition of several companies: Advantedge Commercial Finance, a UK-based specialty lender and factoring company; Bibby Financial Services; REV Financial Group, based in Los Angeles; and Prosperity Funding, located in Fort Lauderdale occurred.

In November 2021, eCapital acquired Flexible Funding, payroll funding firm specializing in funding assistance for the staffing industry, and its subsidiary, InstaPay, that provides freight factoring services.

The company further expanded in 2022 with the acquisition of UMB Bank's accounts receivable financing division and a company called CNH Finance that was active in the healthcare sector. This led to the establishment of eCapital's Healthcare division, dedicated to healthcare industry clients.

eCapital operates within over 80 different sectors, including Transportation, Healthcare, Staffing, and Consumer Goods, among others. The company has also grown through acquisitions, incorporating twelve firms into its corporate structure.

## Industry Reviews

eCapital previously underwent a review consolidation by the Truckers Report website. The outcomings from this review indicate the company's overall impression was negative as of 2014. Key issues highlighted include challenges with contract termination, difficulties in reclaiming escrow/reserve funds, delays in releasing UCCs, the complexity and mutability of web-based contracts, aggressive and misleading sales tactics, lack of customer support, poor communication, issues with fund releases and payments, and unauthorized factoring practices.

Another review by Benzinga, in 2022, provided more positive ratings for eCapital, particularly in the field of financial services, citing easy qualification requirements and fast approval of credit as among the advantage of availing the company's services. The site mentions eCapital as suited to companies that require quick access to cash, those in the midst of expansion, businesses recovering from challenging periods, entities aiming to acquire other companies, and firms favoring asset-based lending.
