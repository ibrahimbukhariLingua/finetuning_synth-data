## History

In 1902, there were four petroleum refineries in London that held a license to import oil in barges along the River Thames, including S. Bowley and Son. There was small-scale oil refining along the Lower Thames estuary in 1914. Refining capacity increased during the inter-war period. By 1938 there were 11 oil refineries in the UK.

In the post-Second World War period several of the existing refineries were expanded and 3 new major oil refineries were built.

Following the oil crisis of 1973-4 refining capacity, and the number of oil refineries, was reduced, and many planned refineries were discontinued. In 1976 there were 17 oil refineries in the UK. By 2000 there were 12 refineries namely:

* BP Amoco, Coryton refinery (later Petroplus, closed 2012)
* Carless, Harwich refinery (now Haltermann Carless)
* Phillips 66, Humber refinery
* Total, Lindsey refinery (Prax from 2021)
* Petroplus, North Tees refinery (closed 2012)
* BP Amoco, Grangemouth refinery (PetroIneos from 2004)
* Nynas, Dundee refinery (closed 2013)
* Shell/Nynas, Eastham refinery (bitumen) (closed after 2010)
* Shell Stanlow refinery (Essar Energy from 2011)
* Amoco, then Murco, Milford Haven refinery (closed 2015)
* Texaco, Pembroke refinery (Valero from 2011)
* Esso, Fawley refinery

Further oil company re-organisations and take-overs, and reductions in demand, led to further refinery closures. By 2019 there were 6 major and one smaller oil refineries in the UK.


## Organisations

Statistics for petroleum refining in the UK are gathered by the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association (UKPIA), on Chancery Lane in London, and the recently formed (July 2016) Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

The Institute of Petroleum merged with the Institute of Energy to form the Energy Institute in 2003. The modern-day institute is headquartered in Marylebone, London. Also nearby is the World Petroleum Council (WPC), known for its four-yearly World Petroleum Congresses.
