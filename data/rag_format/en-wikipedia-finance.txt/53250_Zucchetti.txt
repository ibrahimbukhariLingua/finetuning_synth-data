## History

In 1977 Zucchetti Chartered accountant produced the first software in Italy for the automatic processing of tax returns. The software immediately became a product to be commercialized in Italy.

Then in 1978, Zucchetti was founded: a company to manage orders, sales and assistance services to all the chartered accountants who use accounting and tax solutions.

In 1983 the process of business diversification began with the development of other software solutions: Payroll, Time and Attendance, and the first management programs for companies.

Straddling the 1980s and 1990s, through the acquisition of IT companies, the Zucchetti Group was founded. The company from Lodi extended its presence in different trades: ERP systems, access control, industrial automation, and robotics.

In 2008 the founder Domenico Zucchetti decided to step down in favour of his son Alessandro and his daughter Cristina.

The worldwide business transactions began and in a short time Zucchetti had a direct presence in France, Germany, Romania, Brazil and U.S.A.
