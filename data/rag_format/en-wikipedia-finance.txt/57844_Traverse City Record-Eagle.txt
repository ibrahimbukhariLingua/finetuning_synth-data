# Traverse City Record-Eagle



The ***Traverse City Record-Eagle*** is a daily morning newspaper based in Traverse City, Michigan. It calls itself "Northern Michigan's Newspaper" and is the newspaper of record for Grand Traverse County.


## History

The newspaper was owned by Dow Jones & Company, also publishers of the *Wall Street Journal*. On August 28, 2006, Dow Jones announced they were putting the *Record-Eagle* up for sale, and the paper eventually was purchased by CNHI.

The circulation area of the *Record-Eagle* covers much of northern Michigan, with a particular emphasis on counties adjacent to Greater Traverse City. In all it services 13 counties -- namely Antrim, Benzie, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, Leelanau, Manistee, Missaukee, Otsego and Wexford counties, and limited portions of neighboring counties -- in the northwest lower peninsula.

Associated publications of *The Record-Eagle* include: community weekly *North Coast*; the monthly tabloid *Grand Traverse Scene*; a monthly real estate guide; and specialty sections throughout the year.

While the economy of Michigan as a whole has been characterized as stagnant or declining, the Traverse City area demonstrated significant population growth in the 2000s.

The Traverse City area's economy centers on four-season recreation, retirement living, tourism, higher education, and Native American gaming, and the newspaper covers these concerns. Their editorial board often writes aggressively on environmental issues, with a particular emphasis on the ecology of the Great Lakes, anti-development in the region and liberal political issues.

In October 2005, the Michigan Press Association named the *Record-Eagle* the "Newspaper of the Year" for newspapers with daily circulations between 15,001 and 40,000. In 2005, the *Record-Eagle* told the Media Management Center (Northwestern University) that its daily circulation was 29,341.

In 2006, Suburban Newspapers of America named the *Record-Eagle'*s flagship Web site, Record-Eagle.com, the Best Community News Site in its class (newspapers with circulation under 40,000), and also awarded the site Best Site Architecture and Design.
