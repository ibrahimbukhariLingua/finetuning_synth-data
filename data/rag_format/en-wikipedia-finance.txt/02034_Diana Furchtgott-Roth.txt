### Views

Furchtgott-Roth argues that a regime of lower taxes and less regulation will increase economic growth. She has argued that raising the minimum wage would reduce the number of jobs available to low-skill workers and teens. She has proposed that the U.S. federal government should pay to complement and back up the Global Positioning System because it is used by millions of Americans and is central to the economy.

Furchtgott-Roth has made contributions to The Federalist Society. On questions of interest rate management as a lever of economic growth, she favors the Taylor rule, a stable rate tied to the rate of GDP.
