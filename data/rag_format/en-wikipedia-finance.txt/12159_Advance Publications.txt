# Advance Publications



**Advance Publications, Inc.** is a privately held American media company owned by the families of Donald Newhouse and Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., the sons of company founder Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr. It owns publishing-related companies including American City Business Journals, MLive Media Group, and Condé Nast, and is a major shareholder in Charter Communications (13% ownership), Reddit (30% ownership), and Warner Bros. Discovery (8% ownership).


## History

The company is named after the *Staten Island Advance*, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922.

On August 25, 2018, Advance/Newhouse ("A/N") notified Charter Communications that it intended to establish a credit facility collateralized by a portion of Advance/Newhouse Common Units in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC. That same month, Condé Nast CEO Robert A. Sauerberg Jr. announced his five-year strategy to generate $600 million in new revenue from new revenue streams while driving costs out of the business.

In March 2020, the company acquired The Ironman Group, a mass participation sports platform including the Ironman Triathlons and Absa Cape Epic mountain bike race, from the Wanda Sports Group.


## Description

For most of its history, Advance had no official headquarters; most publications listed the *Advance* offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood as its nominal headquarters.

While it did not have a corporate headquarters, Advance operated a press bureau in Washington, D.C.—the Newhouse News Service (NNS). Opened in 1961, NNS served as a national news bureau for all Advance portfolio publications until it closed in late 2008 as a cost-cutting measure due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

As of November 2019,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ Advance was ranked as the 221st largest privately held company in the United States, according to *Forbes*.


## Subsidiaries

As of August 2021,ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the group owns Condé Nast (which includes the magazines *Vogue*, *The New Yorker*, and *Wired)*, The Ironman Group, Turnitin, Advance Local, American City Business Journals, Stage Entertainment, Leaders Group, and the Seattle-based digital agency Pop, Inc., and is a large shareholder in Reddit.

The company holds an 8.16% ownership in media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery, carried over from its 31% stake in predecessor Discovery, Inc. Advance also owns a 13% stake (as of 2016) in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.
