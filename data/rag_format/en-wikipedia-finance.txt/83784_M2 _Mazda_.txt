M2 (Mazda)


# M2 (Mazda)



**M2** (エムツー, *Emu Tsū*) was an automobile manufacturer and subsidiary of the Mazda Motor Corporation. The company existed from 1991 to 1995 and was also known under its nickname *Mazda Two*. M2 was responsible for the development and the production of vehicle parts, such as bodykits. The headquarters was inside the M2 Building in Tokyo, Japan. The showrooms of complete vehicles was inside the affiliated Setagaya Matsudarotari (Mazda Rotary) Building. The company was closed in 1995, having been a victim of the asset price bubble's collapse which began in 1990 and led to Japan's Lost Decades.

The vehicles of the brand, all modified Mazda products, were made only in small numbers, making them a high priority for collectors. Most known M2 vehicles are currently registered in Japan although some have made it overseas to the USA.
