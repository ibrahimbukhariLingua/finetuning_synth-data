In 1991, the owner of the bank (Ayhan Şahenk) offered the position of chief executive officer to Öngör. He ran the company for a decade.

Garanti experienced a tough and quite successful metamorphosis process in his period. When Öngör became chief executive officer, Garanti's total market value was around $150 million. After ten years of work, the value had increased to US$5 billion and Garanti was chosen as "The Best Bank on Earth" by Euromoney. The change was so successful that, it became a case study in both Harvard Business School and London Business School. And that case study is still being lectured to MBA students in these schools.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
