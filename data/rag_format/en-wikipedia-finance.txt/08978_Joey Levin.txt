## Education

Levin graduated from the Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology from the University of Pennsylvania, with a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School and a B.A.S. in Engineering from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.


## Career

Levin worked from 2001 to 2003 in the Technology Mergers & Acquisitions group for Credit Suisse First Boston (now Credit Suisse) in San Francisco.

In 2003, Levin joined IAC, holding various roles, including Senior Vice President, Mergers & Acquisitions and Finance, before his appointment to CEO of Mindspark Interactive Network, an IAC-owned consumer software company now known as IAC Applications, in November 2009.
Levin then was CEO of IAC Search & Applications, overseeing the desktop software, mobile applications, and media properties that at that time comprised IAC's Search & Applications segment: About.com, Apalon, Ask.com, ASKfm, Citysearch, CityGrid, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, Mindspark, PriceRunner, and SlimWare.

In June 2015, Levin was named CEO of IAC and appointed to the company's Board of Directors. The move was linked with IAC's decision to spin off The Match Group in an IPO, with IAC Chairman Barry Diller citing Levin's "youth, energy, and ability to develop" the assets remaining in IAC's portfolio.

Levin is Chairman of Angi Inc. and on the Board of Directors of Turo and MGM Resorts International.
