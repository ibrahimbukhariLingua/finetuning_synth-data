**Adtran, Inc.** is an American fiber networking and telecommunications company headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama. It is a vendor of networking solutions that address a range of applications. Its customers include communications service providers, governments, enterprises and utilities.


## History

Adtran was founded in 1985 by Mark C. Smith, Lonnie S. McMillian, and Larry Owen,
and began operations in 1986, following the AT&T divestiture of the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). It supplied network equipment to both the RBOCs and independent telephone companies in the United States.

In 2006, Adtran acquired Luminous Networks, a manufacturer of access network equipment. In 2011, it acquired Bluesocket, a maker of enterprise Wi-Fi equipment based in Burlington, Massachusetts. In 2012, it acquired Nokia Siemens Networks' broadband access business based in Germany. In 2016, it acquired CommScope's active fiber business. In 2018, Adtran acquired connected home software provider SmartRG, a Vancouver, WA, based company that develops and provides carrier-oriented, open-source connected home platforms and cloud services for broadband service providers.

In 2021, Adtran entered into a business combination with ADVA Optical Networking SE, a cloud and mobile services networking company based in Munich and Meiningen in Germany. In 2022, Adtran acquired the remaining shares of Cambridge Communication Systems (CCS) Limited, a developer of wireless backhaul and transport systems for small cells. It offers an mmWave Gigabit fiber extension system along with web-based management software for planning, configuring and monitoring networks. In 2024, Adtran self-certified as "Buy America-compliant" with the U.S. Department of Commerce. This list acts as a reference for communications service providers applying for Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) funding.


## Notable products

**50G PON** Adtran's implementation of 50Gbit/s passive optical network (PON) technology includes its SDX 6400 Series of optical line terminals.

**Quantum key distribution (QKD)** In collaboration with Orange, Adtran demonstrated a 400Gbit/s data transmission system using QKD. The hybrid approach integrated quantum-safe encryption with classical cryptographic methods to secure data across a 184Â km system.

**Optical cesium atomic clocks** Adtran's Oscilloquartz division has introduced atomic clocks that leverage optical pumping technology. The improved accuracy and stability of these devices exceed the current ITU-T G.811.1 Enhanced Primary Reference Clock (ePRC) specification. The current highest-end clocks in this range can combine with core grandmaster devices to maintain 100 nanosecond precision for up to 100 days.

**Mosaic One** Mosaic One is a cloud-based software-as-a-service platform that aggregates data from management systems, broadband access and in-home devices to support network operations and customer care.
