# Hopu Investment Management



**Hopu Investment Management** (Hopu) (Chinese: 厚朴投资; pinyin: *Hòupǔ Tóuzī Guǎnlǐ*) is a Chinese alternative investment firm founded in 2007 that is headquartered in Beijing.


## Background

Hopu was founded in 2007 by Fang Fenglei, Richard Ong and Dominic Ho. Fang and Ong were previously senior executives at Goldman Sachs while Ho was former head of KPMG China.

Hopu's first fund of $2.5 billion included Goldman Sachs and Temasek as its cornerstone investors. At the time, Hopu's description as private equity fund was criticized since it stated it would invest in Chinese local companies yet its two largest deals were acquisitions of shares in Bank of China and China Construction Bank sold by Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of America respectively.

In November 2010, it was reported that Hopu will not be raising a second fund, signalling the eventual winding down of the firm. By then Hopu was able to source deals in China establishing a record that many international firms were unable to replicate. Ho who had already long planned his retirement would retire from Hopu at that time.

In February 2011, Ong left Hopu to found his own firm, RRJ Capital as Hopu looked closer to winding down.

In November 2013 after a two-year hiatus, Hopu returned to the private equity scene by raising a $2 billion for its second fund.

In February 2017, Hopu and Arm Holdings established the Hopu-Arm Innovation Fund. The fund owns part of Arm's China unit, which was spun off by SoftBank Group in 2018.

In December 2017, Hopu targeted $2.5 billion in fundraising for its third fund.

In 2021, Hopu launched the Hopu Magnolia Fund that was focused on China growth capital. In April 2023, it was reported it had raised $141 million of its trimmed $250 million target.


## Notable deals

In February 2014, Hopu led a consortium to arrange a private placement of $2.1 billion in new shares issued by GLP’s China operation. In July 2017, Hopu led a consortium of investors including Hillhouse Investment, Vanke and Bank of China bought won a bid to take GLP private by buyout. The deal worth $11.6 billion was the largest private equity buyout in Asia at the time.
