# Banco Safra

## History

The Safra family's history in banking originated with caravan trade between Aleppo, Alexandria and Istanbul during the Ottoman Empire. With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War the Safras moved to Beirut. The Safras decided to move to Brazil in 1952. In the 1960s, Joseph Safra and his father, Jacob Safra, founded Banco Safra, S.A. Most of the Brazilian Sephardic Syrian Jewish community established themselves as retail or wholesale merchants. After having established many financial institutions in Lebanon's capital, Beirut in the 1950s, the Safras set up a small specialized bank which originated letters of credit between Sephardic importers and major banks. From this base they grew via the acquisition and opening of new branches.

In 2012 Joseph Safra purchased the remaining shares of Banco Safra, Safra National Bank of New York and Banque Safra-Luxembourg S.A. from his brother, Moise Safra.
