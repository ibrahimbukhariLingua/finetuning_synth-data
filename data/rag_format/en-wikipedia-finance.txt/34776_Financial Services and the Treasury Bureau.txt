**Finance Bureau** was established on 1 July 1997. The previous form is **Finance Branch** under Colonial Hong Kong, headed by the Secretary for the Treasury.

**Financial Services Bureau** and **Finance Bureau** were merged to become **Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau** on 1 July 2002, headed by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury. A Financial Services Branch and a Treasury Branch were created within the Bureau, each headed by a permanent secretary of D8 rank on the Directorate Pay Scale.

In March 2021, the FSTB announced proposed changes to the Companies Registry, where information on companies would begin to be hidden. In response, David Webb said that such changes "will facilitate corruption, fraud and other crimes." The *New York Times* also said that those changes could potentially benefit Chinese Communist Party officials, as families of top officials had bought property in Hong Kong using companies.

In December 2022, the FSTB announced that it would seek to regulate crowdfunding in Hong Kong, suggesting that all campaigns file an application before launching.
