## Investment philosophy

Bodie, an expert on retirement and financial economics, is a long-time advocate of diversity and "safety-first investing." In 1995 he offered a warning about the risks of investing heavily in stocks, in a journal article: *On the Risk of Stocks in the Long Run.*

In 2003, he spoke again, about investing too heavily in the stock market, saying "people who have been following conventional investment advice are probably taking more risk than they should and don't even know it. They've been told not to worry about the stock market going down because in the long-run, stocks are going to beat everything else. That's a fundamental fallacy."

After the stock market crash of 2007--2008, in a 2009 interview, he advised:

> "Unless you have the heart of a high stakes gambler, get out of stocks now and put your retirement money in inflation protected government bonds and similar instruments. These investments are immune to the kind of calamity Wall Street experienced last year, and they are guaranteed to keep pace with inflation, a potential problem in the future."

Bodie added "he follow[ed] his own advice and did not lose a penny in the recent market meltdown."

Prior to, and during, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, he offered advice on how people can use the principles of risk management to protect their investments, and plan for unforeseen risks. Bodie prescribes a diversified portfolio that includes products with guaranteed returns such as government bonds and traditional retirement plans that assure a minimum interest rate.

His investment strategy consists of a five-step process to analyze and evaluate what kinds of risks one faces, and how to determine the best way to implement an investment plan.

Bodies' five-step plan consists of Risk identification, Risk assessment, Selection of risk-management techniques, Implementation, and Review; the five steps are then followed by a four-step processof:

* Diversifying: owning diversified risky assets to avoid undue risk.
* Hedging: taking less risk and giving up upside; an example is buying I savings bonds (inflation-linked bonds that protect investor purchasing power) to offset the risk of stocks.
* Insuring: paying someone else to pay you if something bad happens, while keeping the upside in good times; an example is a put option on the stock market, a contract that ensures you can sell stocks at a prespecified price.
* Saving for emergencies: keeping an emergency fund of liquid savings for the unexpected.

Bodie has promoted his system of investment and retirement planning in numerous interviews on PBS, CNN and other media outlets over the years.
