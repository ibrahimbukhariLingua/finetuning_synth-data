## Legal dispute

O'Dwyer shared partial transcripts of a presentation from PRSA's annual conference in 1993 to criticize the speaker's ethics for promoting the use of advertising spend to influence editorial at major newspapers. The speaker sued O'Dwyer for copyright infringement and the court ruled that O'Dwyer was protected under fair use. Copyright.gov reports "The court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss, finding that defendants’ publication of articles discussing plaintiff's public speech and defendants’ distribution of the transcripts constituted fair use. The court held that defendants’ purposes were to fairly and reasonably review, comment on, and criticize plaintiff's speech."
