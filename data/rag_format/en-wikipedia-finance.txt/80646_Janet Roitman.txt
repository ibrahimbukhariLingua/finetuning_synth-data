# Janet Roitman



**Janet Roitman** is an American anthropologist. She is the co-founder of the Platform Economies Research Network. Roitman is a professor at RMIT University, an Associate Investigator with the Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S), and co-Director of the Digital Ethnography Research Centre. She is also a member of the Council of Advisors for the Platform Cooperativism Consortium, New York.

From 2007-2022, Roitman was University Professor at The New School in New York City. Before that time, Roitman was a research fellow with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), a member of the Institut Marcel-Mauss (CNRS-EHESS, GSPM), and an instructor at the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques (Sciences po) in Paris.

Roitman’s research focuses on the anthropology of value, economization, and emergent forms of the political. Her research has received support from The Ford Foundation, The MacArthur Foundation, The American Council of Learned Societies, the Agence Française du Développement, The Institute for Public Knowledge, and The US National Science Foundation.

Roitman has conducted extensive research in Central Africa, focusing on the borders of Cameroon, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, and Chad. Her first book, Fiscal Disobedience: An Anthropology of Economic Regulation in Central Africa (Princeton University Press, 2005), is an analysis of the unregulated commerce that transpires on those borders. This book is an anthropology of taxation and economic regulation. It is a study of unregulated commerce on the borders of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad that documents emergent forms of economic value and the consequential transformations in state governance – ultimately raising questions about the relevance and normative consequences of claims about “state failure” on the African continent.

Roitman’s second book, “Anti-Crisis” (Duke University Press, 2013), is the first systematic account of how the concept of crisis functions as a blind spot in contemporary analyses of finance and economics. Anti-Crisis investigates the concept of crisis as an object of knowledge and social inquiry, demonstrating its significance as a foundational concept for our understanding and management of contemporary practices, taking The Great Recession of 2007-08 as a case study. This study illustrates how crisis talk diverts our attention away from primary, constitutional questions, such as how debt is constituted as a form of value.

Roitman's current research inquires into digital financial technology payments platforms as potential sources of new asset classes and domestic capital markets on the African continent, which gives insight into emerging socio-class dynamics and the geo-political contours of high finance.
