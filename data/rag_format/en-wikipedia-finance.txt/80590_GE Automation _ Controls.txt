## History

In 1986, GE Fanuc Automation Corporation was jointly established in the US by FANUC and General Electric (GE). Under the joint venture company, three operating companies, GE Fanuc Automation North America, Inc., in the U.S., GE Fanuc Automation Europe S.A. in Luxembourg, and Fanuc GE Automation Asia Ltd. in Japan were established (the Asian company was established in 1987).

In 2007, the company was renamed to GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms (and GE Fanuc Automation Solutions Europe SA became GE Fanuc Intelligent Platforms Europe SA). GE Fanuc Automation CNC Europe changed its name to Fanuc GE CNC Europe.

In 2009, GE and Fanuc agreed to dissolve joint venture and the software, controls and embedded business became part of GE, under the new name GE Intelligent Platforms.

In 2015, GE Intelligent Platforms, Inc. changed its name to Automation & Controls upon acquisition of Alstom's Power Automation & Controls business.

In 2018, amidst restructuring plans for the whole General Electric group, it was announced that Emerson Electric was to acquire Intelligent Platforms, and the deal was completed on February 1, 2019.
