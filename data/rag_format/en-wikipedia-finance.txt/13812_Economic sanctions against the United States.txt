## Effects of economic sanctions


### Economic effects

The economic effects of an economic sanction can affect both the target country and the country that imposed the sanction. One immediate effect for the targeted country will be an increase in price or ban on the targeted exported goods; this can be seen in Mexico, as goods such as steel, pork, cheese and apples will become more expensive. Also, the People's Republic of China has fallen from the second largest to the third largest market capitalization due to the ongoing trade war with the United States. As the U.S. is one of China's largest trading partners, an economic loss for both countries is created.
