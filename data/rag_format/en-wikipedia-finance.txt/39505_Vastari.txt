**Vastari** is an online service provider that connects museums, exhibition producers, venues, collectors and suppliers for more efficient exhibitions. Vastari's headquarters is located in London, England, with regional representatives in several countries around the world.


## Services

Vastari allows private collectors to upload their objects to a secure online database while remaining anonymous. Registered and verified museums have access to search the database for works relevant to future exhibitions.

Art owners can share their art with curators who will research their collections and put the works into art historical context and exhibition programming. "The system includes two search engines: one database of museum object requests, for collectors to browse and a search engine of art objects for museums to consider for exhibition."

Vastari built the Touring Exhibition platform "Vastari Exhibitions" (formerly known as VTEN), where museums and other exhibition producers can list and exchange exhibitions with other institutional and private venues around the world.

As of August 2017, Vastari had access to over 400,000 works, and has around 900 museums registered.

Judged by leading technology companies such as Uber, Google, and Virgin StartUp, Vastari was included in the 2017 Disrupt 100 list, an annual TÃ¤llt Ventures publication, presenting businesses with the most potential to influence, change, or create new global markets.

In July 2021, Vastari launched a subsidiary company, Vastari Labs in order to help art industry professionals learn to utilize new cutting edge technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cryptoart, Blockchain, Ethereum or Tezos, Smart Contracts, Metaverse and Web3.
