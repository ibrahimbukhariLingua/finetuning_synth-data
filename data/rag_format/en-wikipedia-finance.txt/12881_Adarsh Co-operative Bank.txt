The bank was functioning in both rural as well as urban areas since its inception in 1972, which continued until 1986. The banking business continued in Sirohi district with four branches, but thereafter, new branches were opened to cater to a larger area and customers, initially in the adjoining districts of Jalore, Pali, and Udaipur, followed by locations in the Jaipur and Ajmer districts of Rajasthan.
