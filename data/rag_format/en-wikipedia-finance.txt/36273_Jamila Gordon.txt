## Early life and education

Jamila Gordon was born to a nomadic family in the hinterland of Somalia and brought up in a small village as one of 16 children. As the eldest daughter, she was expected to play a key role in running the family home from approximately five years old, and these responsibilities took precedence over her education. Her family moved to Mogadishu when she was 11 years old to avoid a drought. Once civil war broke out, she became a displaced person in Kenya. There, Gordon met an Australian backpacker, who helped her move to Australia. After arriving in Australia, Gordon took English courses at TAFE NSW and enrolled in an accounting degree at La Trobe University in Melbourne. She switched her major to software engineering after taking a programming elective and eventually graduated with a Bachelor of Business and Information Technology degree in 1995.


## Career

### Lumachain

In April 2018, Gordon founded Lumachain, a company that provides a blockchain and computer vision software for the meat industry, with $3.5 million in seed funding, in a round led by the CSIRO venture capital fund (Main Sequence Ventures). Its stated aim is to add transparency to global food supply chains and provide an auditable record to prove if an item comes from ethically responsible sources (e.g. worker conditions, health code compliance). In 2019, the company partnered with Microsoft, JBS S.A. and CSIRO for a large scale trials.
