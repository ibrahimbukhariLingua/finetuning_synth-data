## Walmart acquisition

In November 2010, multinational retail conglomerate Walmart made a bid to acquire majority shareholding (51%), in Massmart. At that time, the offer was valued at approximately R17 billion (approximately US$2.54 billion or £1.54 billion). On 18 January 2011, Massmart shareholders voted in favour of Walmart's offer of R148 per share (or around $8 per share or ~£6.50 per share). The South African Competition Commission Tribunal gave its approval of the acquisition of 51% of the firm in May 2011. Shortly thereafter, in June 2011, Walmart completed the purchase of 51% of the company's stock.

In August the South African ministries of trade and industry, economic development and agriculture and fisheries lodged an appeal to the decision of the Competition Tribunal's decision to allow the merger with minimal conditions, this follows an appeal filed earlier by SACCAWU, a local labor union. In March 2012 the appeals court dismissed the case by the governmental ministries, but acknowledged that there were legitimate concerns about the effect of the deal on small producers and employment. The appeals court decision effectively put an end to the legal challenges to the merger.

In August 2022, Walmart made an offer to acquire the remaining non-controlling shares of Massmart, and by the end of November the scheme had been finalized and closed, making Massmart a wholly owned subsidiary of Walmart.
