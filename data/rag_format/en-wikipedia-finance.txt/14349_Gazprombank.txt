## Gazprombank Suisse and Roldugin sanctions

Gazprombank Suisse, which employs around 80 people, declared in October 2022 that it was ceasing trading.

In 2023, four bankers at Gazprombank's Swiss branch have been accused of helping Sergei Roldugin, and by extension Vladimir Putin circumvent financial regulations and sanctions placed on Russia following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roldugin has previously been accused of being Putin's wallet, something that the Russian government has denied as anti-Russian propaganda.

According to the accusations that are currently being heard in a court in Switzerland, the bank failed to conduct due diligence checks on the owner of the accounts which were involved in moving money between accounts.
