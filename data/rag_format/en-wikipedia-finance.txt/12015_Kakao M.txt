Kakao M


# Kakao M



**Kakao M** (Korean: 카카오M; formerly **Seoul Records**, **YBM Seoul Records** and **LOEN Entertainment**) was a South Korean entertainment company established by Min Yeong-bin in 1978. It was one of the largest co-publisher companies in South Korea. The company operated as a record label, talent agency, music production company, event management, concert production company, and music publishing house.

As of 2015ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the company was the leading record company in South Korea by net revenue according to the statistics compiled by the Korea Music Content Industry Association (KMCIA) through the Gaon Music Chart (30.4%); it was also the second leading company in terms of album sales (25.4%). LOEN Entertainment became a subsidiary of Kakao in January 2016 and was subsequently renamed two years later.

Online music sales accounted for most of the company's profit, with 93.9% of revenue coming from online music sales. The label also distributed CDs of some other entertainment agencies in South Korea through its branch 1theK, but made less than 5% of its revenue through them.

On March 2, 2021, the company became defunct upon merging into KakaoPage. The merger resulted in the formation of a new company, Kakao Entertainment.


## History


### 1978–2008: Founding of Seoul Records

Kakao M was founded as Seoul Records in 1978 by Min Yeong-bin as a subsidiary of YBM Sisa, a company mainly involved in creating language-learning tapes. The company was officially registered in 1982, and in 1984 it began to produce and distribute records of classical and traditional music. It was registered as a venture capital company in 1999 when it began to sell albums while operating an online shop. In 2000, the company's name was changed to YBM Seoul Records and it began to operate on KOSDAQ. The company joined the IFPI in 2003. Korean conglomerate SK Telecom bought a 60% share of the company in 2005, and YBM Seoul Records subsequently became part of SK Group.


### 2008–2016: Name change to LOEN Entertainment

As of 2008, the company was known as LOEN Entertainment. **LOEN** stood for: **Live On Entertainment Networks** and
**LOve + ENtertainment**

LOEN took charge of SK Telecom's online music distribution service, MelOn, in 2009. MelOn is currently the most used online music sales site in South Korea.

In 2012, the company signed a deal with streaming site Viki so that content from their artists (such as IU, Brown Eyed Girls and Drunken Tiger) would be featured on their site.

In August 2012, the recording artists under LOEN collaborated to release a collaborative EP titled *LOEN Tree Summer Story* under the collective title 'LOEN Tree'.

On July 18, 2013, Affinity Equity Partners, through its subsidiary Star Invest Holdings Ltd., bought 52.56% of LOEN Entertainment's shares, leaving SK Group with only 15%. Five months later, Star Invest Holdings acquired RealNetworks, Inc.'s 8.83% stake in the company. The company was reorganized to include two labels: "LOEN Tree" (Jo Yeong-cheol) and "Collabodadi" (Shinsadong Tiger).

On December 18, 2013, LOEN Entertainment acquired 70% of shares in Starship Entertainment, making it an independent subsidiary of the company.


### 2016–2021: Acquisition by Kakao and name change

On January 11, 2016, LOEN Entertainment was acquired by Kakao Corporation.

On May 11, 2017, LOEN Entertainment announced its strategic drama production alliance with CJ E&M's drama production subsidiary Studio Dragon Corporation. Among the plans under the alliance is producing dramas based on web novels and webtoons on KakaoPage and Daum Webtoons (which copyrights are managed by *Podotree*, the web literature subsidiary of Kakao). (LOEN Entertainment first entered the drama production industry three years ago through the cable-web drama *Another Parting*, which starred Seo In-guk and Wang Ji-won.) On August 25, LOEN Entertainment announced that its joint venture with Studio Dragon will be called as **Mega Monster**.

The company has also signed actress Kim So-hyun through setting up her own independent label, **E&T Story Entertainment**, which is led by her long-time manager Park Chan-woo.

Upon approval by the company's board of directors in a December 20 meeting, the company is known as **Kakao M Corporation** (Korean: 주식회사 카카오엠) since March 23, 2018. The letter **M** in the new corporate name stands for three things: **Melon** (the company's flagship online music service), **Music** (the company's core business) and **Media** (another business that the company will advance to in the future). The company will now also have a corporate catchphrase, *We Entertain*.

Barely a month before the company's relaunch under its new name, Sean Seong-hoon Park resigned from both his positions as CEO of the company and chief strategy officer of its parent company, and later moved to Netmarble Games. He was replaced by Melon division head Lee Jae-wook.

On February 28, 2021, Kakao M's music was removed from Spotify after its licensing deal with the streaming service expired. They had addressed the removal in a statement, citing the streaming service as the party who had ensued it. On March 11, 2021, Kakao M renewed its licensing deal with Spotify.

In March 2021, Kakao M and KakaoPage merged into a company named Kakao Entertainment, while having its own representative system under the name "M Company" there.

## Controversies


### Price fixing

**2011**
LOEN Entertainment, along with then-parent SK Telecom, was one of the 15 companies fined and sued by the Korean FTC for price rigging in 2011. The company was fined $9.6 million for its role in the scheme.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

**2016**
On October 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of Korea handed out a 100 million won fine each to LOEN Entertainment and its closest competitor Genie Music (then known as KT Music) for colluding in price fixing, dating back to a case filed in 2008. Co-CEO Shin Won-soo, who was the sole CEO at the time being, was also sentenced to pay 10 million won.


### Stealing royalties

On September 26, 2019, it was revealed that 3 former executives of the company have been charged with stealing 18.2 billion won in royalties from Melon, artists, and producers.


### *Incredible* promotion conflict

In 2013, LOEN Entertainment made a deal with C-JeS Entertainment to promote and distribute Junsu's second studio album *Incredible*. Days before the album's release, C-Jes was reportedly notified by LOEN that they would distribute the album but had scrapped plans for promotional marketing and broadcasting Junsu's upcoming showcase on MelOn, although they would be able to broadcast it on LOEN TV. Promotional banners regarding the album's release on MelOn also disappeared from LOEN's social media accounts. C-JeS subsequently threatened to remove mentions of LOEN from Junsu's upcoming showcase and to file for a civil appeal to the Fair Trade Commission and Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission.

In response, LOEN Entertainment stated that they were still in discussions regarding the album's promotion and that nothing had been confirmed prior to the relevant article's release. They pointed to the showcase event page on MelOn's homepage still being up as evidence that promotions were going ahead as planned. C-JeS responded saying that they had begun receiving pre-orders for the album and entries for the showcase event without a response from LOEN.

Following media attention, the two companies met on July 8 and resolved the dispute. *Incredible* was promoted and distributed by LOEN as planned.
