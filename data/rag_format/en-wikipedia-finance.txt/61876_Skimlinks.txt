## History


### Founding

Skimlinks was founded in 2007 by co-founders Alicia Navarro and Joe Stepniewski as a result of a pivot away from the social recommendation tool Skimbit.com. Notably, it is one of the first technology companies headquartered in what is now known as the Silicon Roundabout area in London.

Alicia Navarro created Skimbit.com in 2006 in Australia, but moved to London, England to build her business as she felt it was a much more supportive environment for entrepreneurs. Skimbit was relatively successful and quickly evolved into a white-label social shopping service.

In November 2008, Joe Stepniewski was elected as a co-founder. Together with Navarro, they realised that both users and investors weren't interested in their end product, but in the behind-the-scenes technology, they were using to monetise their site through affiliate marketing. As a result, they pivoted the company into what it is today - a "stand-alone commercial platform to help publishers monetize their editorial and user-generated content."

Alicia Navarro has been featured in several prominent publications, highlighting her role as one of the few female CEOs in the ad-tech world. She was also recently announced as the winner of the Entrepreneur of the Year Award during the 2014 edition of the FDM Everywoman in Technology Awards.


### Partnership with Pinterest

In February 2012, LL Social, an online marketing blog, broke the news that Pinterest was using Skimlinks to monetise content posted by its users. Commercial links included in Pins were being affiliated via Skimlinks. Although the partnership had been ongoing for 2 years, Pinterest had just recently grown exponentially in popularity and the news was badly received.

Most of the backlash arose from the company's failure to disclose its monetisation practices rather than its decision to monetise users' content. Though it was claimed that the revelations prompted Pinterest to drop its affiliation with Skimlinks, Pinterest's CEO, Ben Silbermann, clarified that they had actually been using Skimlinks as an option whilst they explored various monetisation solutions, but had stopped using the service a week before the news broke.


### Investors

Funds have been raised from investors including: The Accelerator Group, Sussex Place Ventures, NESTA, Venrex, BDMI and Greycroft, with advisory board members such as Gokul Rajaram (formerly Head of Product for Google AdSense and Facebook Ads) and Oren Michels (CEO of Mashery). In early 2015, Skimlinks' brought investors from Frog Capital on board as part of their Series C funding round, bringing their total funds raised to $24 million.


### Acquisitions

Skimlinks acquired New York–based competitor, Atma Links, in 2011 to power its SkimWords technology. It then acquired InvisibleHand - a significant player in real-time e-commerce and product pricing - in 2013.
