### Biography

Lagassé taught as a visiting professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Sherbrooke from 1975 to 1977. He gave several lectures to the Chamber of Notaries of Quebec.

In October 2011, Le Groupe Lagassé, led by Lagassé, experienced financial difficulties. The Superior Court of Quebec ordered Le Groupe Lagassé Inc. and Louis Lagassé to repay loans totaling nearly $CAD 1.8 million to the Business Development Bank of Canada, following the bankruptcy of SR Télécom, a subsidiary of the group. In addition, other lawsuits had been filed, including a claim by the Commission des normes du travail du Québec and unpaid fees to the law firm Stikeman Elliott.

In December 2011, Lagassé Communication et Industries (LC&I), a subsidiary of Groupe Lagassé in France, was placed in receivership by the Quimper Commercial Court. Lagassé lost control of the company located in Douarnenez, and two new directors were appointed to manage the 225 employees. The Works Council expressed concerns about financial management and hired lawyers to investigate the company's finances.

In 2014, Lagassé was indicted in France for misuse of corporate assets, bankruptcy, and embezzlement. Accused of embezzling €30 million from his telecommunications company, EADS, purchased in 2005, bail was set at €1 million. He was forced to resign from the board of directors of Hydro Québec. The Lagassé Group was ordered by the Superior Court to pay $CAD 1.6 million to the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) in 2011. The BDC had granted a loan to one of its subsidiaries three years earlier, but it was another company in the group that recovered the funds. Lagassé was ordered to pay the BDC $CAD 188,034, personally.
