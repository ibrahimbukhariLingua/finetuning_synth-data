## History

The first Danish cooperative pig abattoir was established in Horsens, Denmark in 1887. In the following 40–50 years, a large number of cooperative pig abattoirs were established across the country. In 1960, the cooperative abattoirs began to merge in order to better have the strength to carry out the tasks with, among other things, sales, marketing and product development.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1990, Danish Crown was established as a fusion of Wenbo, Østjyske and Tulip Food Company (which included Horsens Andels-Svineslagteri from 1887), and in 1994, Slagteri Syd was merged in. In 1998, Danish Crown and Vestjyske Slagterier merged.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In April 2002, the Danish Competition Council gave permission for a merger between Danish Crown and Steff Houlberg, and a large part of the original cooperative pig abattoirs is part of the new Danish Crown.

On 13 October 2010, the shareholders decided to transfer the activities to a limited company, Danish Crown A/S formerly Danish Crown Holding A/S. The co-operatives retained ownership through the co-operative, which is now called the Danish Crown Amba Supply Company. The limited company was originally established on 1 July 2001.
