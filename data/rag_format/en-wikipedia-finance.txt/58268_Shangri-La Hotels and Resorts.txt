## History

The first hotel of the luxury Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts Group was the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore, opened on 23 April 1971. The name derives from the mythical place Shangri-La, described in the 1933 novel *Lost Horizon* by British author James Hilton.

The Shangri-La Hotel Singapore was managed by Westin Hotels & Resorts, until Shangri-La International Hotel Management Limited was founded in 1979, and management of the Singapore Shangri-La was taken back over from Westin in 1984. However, it would not be until 1991 that Shangri-La assumed control of the rest of the hotels.

This hotel has also become the host to a prominent inter-governmental security conference known as the Shangri-La Dialogue.
