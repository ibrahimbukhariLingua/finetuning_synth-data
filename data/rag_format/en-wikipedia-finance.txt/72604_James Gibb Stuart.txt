**James Gibb Stuart** (30 August 1920 â€“ 23 September 2013) was a financial author, owner of Ossian Publishers, and chairman of the Scottish Pure Water Association. He was known for his outspoken opposition to the European Union, and for publishing a book on monetary reform, *The Money Bomb*, in which he advocates a complete overhaul of British currency, the pound sterling.


## The Money Bomb

When *The Money Bomb* was published in 1983, well-documented efforts to quash any publicity clashed with advocacy of its arguments by the Margaret Thatcher government, who were struggling to freeze that country's national debt at twelve billion pounds .
