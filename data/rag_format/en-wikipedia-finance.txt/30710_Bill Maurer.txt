## Research

Maurer’s research encompasses ethnographic and historical work on the Caribbean offshore tax haven economy, specifically in the British Virgin Islands, Islamic banking and alternative currencies, and the material technologies and cultural practices money, finance, and law.

Maurer’s first book *Recharting the Caribbean: Land, Law and Citizenship in the British Virgin Islands* shows how the offshore tax haven economy was not a foreign imposition, but rather grew out of local practices of kinship and land ownership and was shaped by local conflicts around class and race. This work highlights the role of colonial legal regimes and national sovereignty claims in the uneven geography of global finance. Maurer’s second book *Mutual Life, Limited: Islamic Banking, Alternative Currencies, Lateral Reason* compares global Islamic banking and finance with the local and alternative currency movement. Maurer’s work on money, especially his widely cited survey of the anthropology of money, challenges assumptions about money’s effects on social life and calls for a shift in focus away from money’s abstract meanings as a tool for producing equivalence and towards its diverse uses and practices, especially in settings that are not strictly market-based.

More recently, Maurer has studied the cultural and political implications of mobile and digital technologies, especially cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.
