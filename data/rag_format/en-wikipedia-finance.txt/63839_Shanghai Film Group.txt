# Shanghai Film Group



**Shanghai Film Group Corporation** (Chinese: 上海電影集團公司) is a film, animation and documentary production company under the Shanghai Media & Entertainment Group conglomerate. In 2001, it was announced to be a combination of a number of studios, all of which are located in Shanghai, China.


## History

Many of the individual entertainment production hubs were the center of art and culture for the country going as far back as the 1890s. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1950, numerous studios were established in session all around Shanghai. Many would merge with smaller companies that offer similar functions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On January 19, 2017, Shanghai Film Group Corp. and Huahua Media said they would finance at least 25% of all Paramount Pictures movies over a three-year period. Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media, in the deal, would help distribute and market Paramount's features in China.
