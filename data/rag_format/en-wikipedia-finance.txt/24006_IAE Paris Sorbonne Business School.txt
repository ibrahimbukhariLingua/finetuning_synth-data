# IAE Paris Sorbonne Business School



**IAE Paris Sorbonne Business School** (also known in French as **IAE Paris**, short for **Institut d'administration des entreprises de Paris**) is a public business school, part of the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in Paris, France. It is part of the IAE network.

Located in Paris, IAE Paris Sorbonne Business School welcomes over 2,800 students each year and has graduated more than 39,000 managers and executives since its inception in 1956. These graduates occupy positions of responsibility across all sectors of the economy in France and internationally. Its educational programs, in both initial education and executive programs, cater to students, corporate executives and managers, and professionals in private practice. The school is currently led by Professor Eric Lamarque.


## History

IAE Paris Sorbonne Business School was founded in 1956 by Gaston Berger and Professor Robert Goetz. It is a public administrative institution under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and affiliated with the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. The affiliation became an association in 2014, following the Law on Higher Education and Research.

Initially, only one program was offered: the Certificate of Aptitude for Business Administration (CAAE), aimed at providing a dual skill set in management similar to the American MBA. The CAAE evolved into a specialized higher studies diploma (DESS) in 1974 and then into a professional Master's in Business Administration (MAE) in 2006. IAE Paris's primary mission was to train professionals in management. It was one of the three French institutions, along with HEC (HEC's Executive MBA program) and INSEAD, specialized in delivering an equivalent to the Harvard MBA.


## Education

Since its inception, IAE's education has been centered on the case method, a core aspect of MBA teaching established by the Harvard Business School, which Gaston Berger introduced in France.

The institute offers graduate and postgraduate diploma programs, mainly masters and MBAs in business administration, finance, management control, audit, marketing, human resources, and management of associations, as well as a PhD programs in management sciences. More recently, IAE Paris has introduced a specialized bachelor's degree in retail commerce.

Admission into IAE is highly selective, requiring not only good academic records but also a specific entrance test score (Score IAE-Message) covering logical reasoning, French, English, and general knowledge. IAE looks for candidates who value merit and public interest, emphasizing sincerity over calculated interests.


### Executive programs

Education for working professionals is the institute's historical mission. Continuing education students still represent two-thirds of the student body. They can choose from generalist MBA (MAE) and specialized (Executive Masters) programs. The MBA is a generalist diploma in management, aimed at executives with at least three to five years of experience. It enables professionals to acquire dual competency in management and the necessary leadership for executive roles. The MBA-MAE is offered in various formats, with varying degrees of international exposure, full-time or part-time.


## Research

Research is a fundamental aspect of IAE Paris Sorbonne Business School, embedded in its academic DNA. The institution engages in pure management research or interdisciplinary studies, including economics. Students are encouraged to undertake theses with a strong academic dimension, fostering a critical perspective and the ability to engage with scholarly debates and scientific reasoning. This approach aims to instill a culture of critical inquiry and skepticism towards management practices.
