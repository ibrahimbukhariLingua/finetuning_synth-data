## Activities


### Policy dialogue and knowledge-sharing

* The Global Forum on Development (GFD). The GFD (focusing on “Preparing for the Post-2015 World” in 2013, 14 and 15) provides a venue for high-level policy makers and civil society to exchange perspectives, explore challenges, opportunities and learn lessons about current poverty reduction policies and methods for fostering social cohesion and progress.
* Regional International Economic Forums for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and forthcoming for Asia attract participation by governments, international organisations, civil society, foundations, think tanks, the media, corporations and academia.
* As part of the Development Centre’s contribution to the OECD Strategy for Development, the Centre is leading efforts across the OECD Secretariat to establish a multi-year process of knowledge sharing and policy dialogue between OECD and partner countries facing similar development challengesᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, commencing with the:

* The Development Centre has Networks of key stakeholders engaged in policy dialogue, producing relevant analysis, and sharing experience on policy reform for development. Some of these Networks attract experts as members but also offer opportunities for the Governing Board to participate in open sessions:

### Cross sectoral analysis

* Multi-dimensional Country Reviews (MDCRs): a tool that contributes to the implementation of the OECD Strategy for Development and directly engages non-Members. The MDCRs provide national policy makers and their partners with the inputs needed for a nationally owned and implemented development strategy; underlining the set of concrete steps that will address the key constraints across all dimensions of national development. The national development strategy will help the country maintain momentum for the social and economic development needed, as well as identify and build effective strategies to achieve inclusive, sustainable and equitable growth that can improve the well-being of all citizens. The effectiveness of the MDCR's process cements the quality of the national development strategy.

### Global, regional and country analysis

* Annual thematic flagship publication: OECD Perspectives on Global Development
* Regional Economic Outlooks in partnership with international organisations in each region:

* Regional/country studies: social cohesion policy reviews, gender, migration, youth inclusion, competitiveness, global value chains, taxation and middle-classes; innovation and territorial development, capital markets, etc.
