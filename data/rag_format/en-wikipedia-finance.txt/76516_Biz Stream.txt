***Biz Stream*** is a weekly business news programme aired on NHK's international broadcasting service NHK World-Japan, hosted by Shaula Vogue and Raja Pradhan. It premiered 7 April 2018; it airs three times a month, on weekends, with an extra repeat on Wednesday early mornings (JST).

The programme usually enters hiatus from late April to early May (Golden Week), in late summer, and from mid-December to mid-January. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the programme entered a five-week hiatus, starting 18 April 2020 and ending 23 May 2020.

*Biz Stream* aired its 100th episode on 15 May 2021.


## Format

*Biz Stream* is an "upbeat business programme" dealing with the top business stories and "the latest innovations" from Japan and elsewhere. Every episode includes analysis by an expert guest and starts with a review of the main business headlines of the week.

The main segments are:

* *In Depth* deals with a business story out of the headlines reviewed at the start of the show.
* *On-Site Report* features a story of an issue affecting the Japanese or Asia-Pacific business community or their economy, and the way companies deal with it.
* *World Perspective* is a report from outside Japan, mostly from the Asia Pacific and Southeast Asia regions.
* *Global Trends* is a feature about sustainable, innovative products and entrepreneurship.

Occasionally, there are special episodes dealing only with one issue, such as a review of the Heisei era from the business side or an investigation on plastic waste exported to Southeast Asia.

The programme is also available on online service *NHK Huayu Shijie*, broadcast as *Shāngyè Xìnxī Liú BIZ STREAM* (simplified Chinese: 商业信息流 BIZ STREAM; traditional Chinese: 商業信息流 BIZ STREAM) with Simplified Chinese subtitles.
