# U.S. Bank Building (Chicago)



**U.S. Bank Building**, formerly 190 South LaSalle Street, is a 573 feet (175 m) tall skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois.


## History

It was completed in 1987 and has 40 floors. Johnson/Burgee Architects designed the building, which is the 57th tallest building in Chicago.

From 1988-2016 the lobby of the building featured a tapestry by Helena Hernmarck titled "The 1909 Plan of Chicago" depicting the Civic Center Plaza proposed in the Burnham Plan of Chicago. The tapestry is now in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

In May 2013, U.S. Bank announced it agreed to increase its leased space in the structure from 66,000 square feet (6,100 m²) to 110,000 square feet (10,000 m²). The terms of the lease also gave the bank naming rights for the building through 2026.
