# Colossus Bets



**Colossus Bets** is a British bookmaker specialising in pools betting. The Colossus Bets is headquartered in London, England, and was founded by former Monsanto PR operative Bernard Marantelli and Zeljko Ranogajec in 2013. The bookmaker currently focuses in pools betting by incorporating modern betting features such as Cash Out and Syndicates, currently holding seven US patents. As well as offering lottery-sized jackpots.


## History

Colossus Bets was launched in the UK in 2013, initially providing solely football pools. They would go on to add horse racing, greyhound racing, American football, ice hockey, basketball and darts pools, making them a multi-sport pools provider.

In 2017, Colossus launched Syndicates, a group betting product that would allow its users to share the cost of their bets, and any potential winnings, with fellow players. The introduction of horse racing pools in July 2018 meant that, for the first time, The Tote was no longer the sole horse racing pools operator in the UK market. The Place 6 pool was introduced as a direct equivalent to the Placepot. In addition to offering their sports and racing pools on their website, the Colossus Bets pools have also been integrated into a number of partner websites across the world, including Bet365, Betway Africa, Dafabet, Matchbook, Racebets, Mr Green, Nairabet, Football Pools, eStave, and Paf.

In August 2017, Colossus Bets announced that they had entered into a partnership with 54 British racecourses in order to supply betting pools. However, in May 2018 a number of newspaper articles were published revealing that Zeljko Ranogajec was the principal backer of the company using the alias of John Wilson. Subsequently, the consortium of 54 racecourses (Britbet) cancelled their arrangement with Colossus Bets in favour of The Tote.

In May 2021 Esports Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: EBET) announced an exclusive alliance with Colossus Bets. Under the terms of the agreement Colossus Bets became a shareholder in Esports Technologies Inc.


## Conscious Colossus

In 2020, Colossus Bets launched ‘Conscious Colossus', a charitable initiative created to “target several areas of responsibility and covering a wide range of causes, including the advancement of sport within communities, responsible gambling education and animal welfare.” Conscious Colossus announced that they would be supporting three charities in their maiden year; Alive and Kicking, The Greyhound Trust and YGAM. In 2021 they announced an updated line up of Alive and Kicking, YGAM and Clime-It Brothers for their second year.
