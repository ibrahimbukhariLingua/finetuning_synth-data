The Metzler has been owned continuously and exclusively by the founding family since its foundation in 1674. After 1971 Friedrich von Metzler de lead the bank in the 11th generation as personally liable partner of the banking house. End of May 2018 he retired from the executive committee.


## History

The origins of the banking house Metzler go back to a trading company founded by Benjamin Metzler in 1674.
The name *B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co.* is derived from the son of the company founder Benjamin Metzler, who wanted to remember his deceased father by this naming.
As early as the end of the 17th century, there was a coupling of merchandise and financial transactions due to the significant distance trade activities.


### 18th century

First money and exchange transactions of the company are provable since 1728. In 1742, a son of the founder was elected to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Board. Since then, owners of the bank have almost uninterruptedly been represented on the management body of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and *Deutsche Börse AG*.
The development from trading to banking was largely completed around 1760. In 1769 Friedrich Metzler became a partner in the family business, in 1771 its leader. He entered the government bond business. It began in 1779 with a loan in favor of the Electorate of Bavaria. It was followed by Palatinate as a Debtor, 1795 the Kingdom of Prussia followed with a loan of one million guilders. Also Saxe-Meiningen, the House of Nassau as well as the House of Orange-Nassau became customers of Metzler. Through his dealings with the Prussian House of Lords he was awarded the title *Königlich-preußischer geheimer Kommerzienrat* (Royal Prussian Secret Commercial Council).


### 19th century

Towards the end of the 19th century the competition with the newly formed joint-stock banks led to a strategic orientation of the business toward the core competences of a private bank: renouncing the on-balance-sheet business and concentrating on individual financial services. Asset management was of particular importance.


### 20th century

At the beginning of the 20th century, the bank restricted the current account and lending business. At the same time, the trading of securities was deliberately expanded.

In 1938, the Metzler bank was involved in the forced Aryanization of Jewish banking houses, such as the banking houses *Bass & Herz*
de, *J. Dreyfus & Co.* and *Jacob S.H. Stern*.

In order to safeguard independence in the long term and to strengthen the capital base, the company was transformed in 1986 from a partnership into a capital company in the form of a limited joint-stock partnership. This maintained the personal liability of the management, which is characteristic of a private bank.

At the same time, *B. Metzler seel. Sohn & Co. Holding AG* was established as the parent company of a holding based on the Anglo-Saxon model.

Since then, the various business areas have been the responsibility of independent subsidiaries of the bank. In 1994, the *B. Metzler GmbH* was founded, in which the corporate finance consulting is consolidated.

The development of the bank in the 20th century was largely influenced by Albert von Metzler.


### 21st century

In 2001, one office was opened in Tokyo, and another in Beijing in 2009. In 2007, the Metzler bank celebrated its 333rd anniversary.
