## African Innovation Foundation

In 2009, he founded the African Innovation Foundation (AIF) which aimed to support sustainable projects in Africa. The Foundation's project "Innovation Prize for Africa (IPA)" was launched in 2011 in cooperation with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). The IPA held an annual competition honoring African entrepreneurs and innovators through investment in their ecosystems and business development. In 2016 the Innovation Prize for Africa celebrated its 5th anniversary, and the AIF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for cooperation to support African innovators. In February 2017 the AIF signed a MoU with the Botswana Innovation Hub to support innovations in Botswana. In addition to the IPA, the AIF founded the ZuaHub, a platform connecting innovators with resources. By 2017 the IPA had a database of over 6,000 innovators from 51 African countries.

In 2012, the IPA was endorsed by a joint resolution of the African Union (AU) conference of ministers of finance, development and planning, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN-ECA) conference of ministers of finance, planning and economic development. The AU/UN-ECA resolution invited "African governments and the private sector to contribute to financing the African Science, Technology and Innovation Endowment Fund and the Innovation Prize for Africa" to ensure the sustainability of the IPA.


### African Law Library

The AIF also initiated the *African Law Library* (ALL). The project was launched on 28 November 2013 at the African Union's headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. With ALL Bastos implemented his idea of an online portal offering access to a wide range of legal documents as well as law and governance texts from African countries. The Huffington Post reported that 'in June 2014 alone, more than 10,000 research sessions were initiated on the African Law Library platform'. In March 2015 over 4,500 regional and national court cases, 3,600 legislative acts and 8,000 secondary sources from eight African countries were published online.


## Philanthropic activities

In October 2011 Bastos founded the Kitangana Tennis Project for orphans in Angola. In 2017, his Quantum Global Group sponsored the Muhr Awards for Arab films at the Dubai International Film Festival. In addition, Bastos supported several universities. He sponsored a research project at the Center of Neuroscience ZNZ, a collaboration between the University of Zurich and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH. He also served on the advisory board of the Event Letterari Monte Verita Festival, the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) and the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business.


## Criticism

In 2011, Bastos was convicted together with his partner by a criminal court in Switzerland for "repeated qualified criminal mismanagement". Both have illegally paid out money in an investment company under their control, which partly lined their own pockets. In 2017 the conviction played a major role in public discussions of his business activities which were uncovered by journalists in the Paradise Papers. According to the London High Court of Justice, the applicants of a freezing order against Bastos made an "unfortunate misrepresentation" in their description of the Swiss conviction. Their wording stated that the conviction called for a suspended custodial sentence. However, Bastos was only supposed to pay a fine which was later suspended. Their application for a freezing order was dismissed due to this misrepresentation, among other breaches of duty. Furthermore, the Swiss prosecutors dropped the charges, and Bastos held no criminal record.


## Angola sovereign wealth fund

In 2012, following a selection procedure, Bastos' asset management group Quantum Global was awarded the contract to manage the newly created Angolan sovereign wealth fund, the Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA), with fund assets of US$5 billion.

In November 2017 the BBC News reported about him in relation to the Paradise Papers. The Paradise Papers reported his use of Angola's sovereign wealth fund Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) for his own investment projects. According to a Bastos interview by The Guardian, FSDEA had not paid brokerage or finder’s fees for those investments where he himself also held a stake. After the Paradise Papers were leaked licenses of seven funds of Bastos' Quantum Global were suspended in Mauritius after a visit of Angolan officials. The Mauritius Supreme Court froze US$519 million on 58 bank accounts of Quantum Global in early April 2018. In London a British court froze US$3 billion on Quantum Global accounts at the end of April 2018.

At the end of July 2018 the freezing of British bank accounts was lifted by London's High Court. It ruled, that the freezing was based on false information. The court accused the state funds representatives of "breaches of the duty of disclosure" in the fund's application for a freezing and called these breaches "substantial" and "culpable". "There is no evidence to suggest that the use of offshore structures by the group was anything other than the normal and legitimate way the group structured itself for tax, regulatory and other proper business purposes; or that Mr Bastos’ personal use of such structures was not his normal modus operandi for legitimate personal reasons." The High Court's ruling stated that limited partnerships in offshore jurisdictions "are not unusual for private equity investments; that they were known about and not disapproved by Deloitte at the time; that the structure was not a matter of criticism by E&Y in their investigations; and that the drawing down of the full committed amounts into the accounts in the names of the Limited Partnerships so as to put them beyond the control of FSDEA was for a legitimate political objective."

After the High Court in London had legally confirmed the contracts between Quantum Global and FSDEA, Bastos was taken into pre-trial detention in Angola in the autumn of 2018 on the charge that he had enriched himself with state property. The media saw the arrest as an attempt by Angola to exert pressure on Quantum Global and Bastos. In March 2019, Angola and Quantum Global reached a settlement. Quantum Global released the mandate early, and Angola paid a settlement to Bastos and dropped all charges against Bastos and Quantum Global. In Mauritius, the account freezes were lifted and the tax authorities renewed Quantum Global's licenses. Quantum Global withdrew a claim for damages against the FSDEA in London. When the settlement was reached, Bastos was released from pre-trial detention in March 2019.
