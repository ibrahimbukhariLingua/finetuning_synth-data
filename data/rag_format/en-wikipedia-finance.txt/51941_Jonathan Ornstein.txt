## Controversies

In 1978, Ornstein dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania after his junior year and relocated to the Los Angeles area when he was 21 years old. He became a well-recognized broker for the firm E.F. Hutton as the youngest ever to hold a position there.

Ornstein signed a consent order in June 1993 agreeing to a $20,000 fine and a three-year ban from the American Stock Exchange for making unauthorized transactions in customer accounts as a broker for Prudential-Bache Securities, according to NASD records. Earlier the same year, he was fined $10,000 and suspended for two years from associating with NASD members in connection with similar allegations, according to the association's records.
