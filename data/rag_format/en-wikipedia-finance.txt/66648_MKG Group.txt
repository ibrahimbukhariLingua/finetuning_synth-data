## History

MKG Group was established by Georges Panayotis in Paris in 1985 to service the hotel sector. Soon after, the group began tracking hotel data and trends in supply and demand, as well as conducting research studies for the sector. In 1994, the company launched its first publication *Hôtels et marketing*, later to be known as *HTR Magazine* and now *Hospitality-ON*. This was followed by the newspaper *Hôtel Restau Hebdo* in 2000, and the first Hermès Awards for the hotel and hospitality industry (later to become the Worldwide Hospitality Awards) were awarded in the same year. It opened offices in London in 2007 and in Berlin and Cyprus in 2008. In 2010 it launched the first Hospitality Management Schools Awards.

The company created the first classification of hotel groups and hotel chains in 1995, and the following year it launched the inaugural Hotel Makers Forum, later to be known as the Global Lodging Forum (GLF). In 2002 it took over the company Network Systems, which specialised in computer software for database processing and e-procurement platforms; and the next year MKG Qualiting produced the first online quality database to enable real time consultation and analysis of a particular hotel with respect to quality criteria. This was followed in 2004 by the creation of the HotelCompset Daily platform, which provides subscribing hotels a tool to track daily and monthly activity and compare key performance indicators. An online customer satisfaction survey platform known as Ola Kala was launched in 2009.

The company has COFRAC accreditation, to lead grading inspection of hotels 1 to 5 stars in France under new classification standards from January under the brand HotelClass. In October, MKG Qualiting extended its accreditation to perform inspections for the classification of serviced apartments and touristic residences under the brand ResidenceClass.
