## History

The Armed Forces Financial Network was founded in 1985 at the request of the United States Army to support the "Surepay" direct deposit initiative. The AFFN's role in the Surepay initiative was to be one way U.S. military personnel could gain access to their money.

In 2017 the Armed Forces Financial Network launched a chip and pin travel card.
