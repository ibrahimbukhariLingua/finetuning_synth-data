# List of winners of the Gerald Loeb Award for Small and Medium Newspapers



**The Gerald Loeb Award for Small and Medium Newspapers** was a business news reporting award conferred in 2013 and 2014, although similar awards have existed under other titles since 1974. The "Newspaper" category was awarded in 1958–1973. It was split into two categories beginning in 1974: "Small Newspapers" and "Large Newspapers". A third category, "Medium Newspapers," was created in 1987. The small and medium newspaper awards were combined together as "Medium & Small Newspapers" in 2009–2012, and "Small & Medium Newspapers" in 2013–2014. The last year newspaper categories were awarded was 2014. "Small & Medium Newspapers" was replaced by the platform-neutral category "Local" in 2015.
