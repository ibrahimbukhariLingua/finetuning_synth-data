PX Index


# PX Index



The **PX Index** (until March 2006 the **PX 50**) is a capitalization-weighted index of major stocks that trade on the Prague Stock Exchange. It is calculated by the Vienna Stock Exchange. At the time of its inception, the calculation start date for the index was set to the 5th April 1994 and its opening value was fixed at 1,000 points. At this time the index included 50 companies traded on the Prague Stock Exchange, being named accordingly as PX 50.

In 2014, the Prague Stock Exchange introduced the total return index **PX-TR**. It shares the same base as the PX Index but, unlike the PX index, the PX-TR takes dividends into account.
