# Eurocement group



The **EUROCEMENT group** is the biggest supplier of cement, ready-mix concrete and aggregates in Russia. It has 16 cement plants across Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan as well as several concrete mix plants, concrete goods factories and aggregate-mining quarries.
The Group's annual production capacity is 40 MT of cement and 10 Mcm of concrete. Aggregate resources: carbonate rock explored reserves amount to 2.8 billion tonnes; granite-explored reserves amount to 1.8 billion tonnes.


## History

EUROCEMENT group was formed in 2002 following the merger of Rosuglesbit and Shtern-cement. The company originally had four plants: Maltsovsky Portlandcement, Mikhailovcement, Lipetskcement, and Savinsky cement. But since 2005, following the purchase of seven additional cement plants, EUROCEMENT group has become a leading company in the Russian cement market.

In May 2014 the company signed a package of contracts with Chinese companies for equipment supplies, engineering, installation supervision and employee training totaling $530.7 million. Contracted supplies include mechanical equipment, furnaces, cyclone heat exchangers, crushers, and mills. The new equipment will be used for the construction of new cement plants with a total capacity of 17 million tons of cement per year in six regions of Russia: Leningrad, Ryazan, Bryansk, Arkhangelsk, Ulyanovsk and Samara regions, according to the corporate message.

In July 2021, Sberbank, the main creditor of the Eurocement group, sold its shares and debt load to the Mikhailov Construction Materials Plant for 161 billion rubles, according to the evaluation of proposals on Russian Auction House electronic platform.
