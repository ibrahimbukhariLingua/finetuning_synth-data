## Lyrics

> Young man if you would westward go
> And make yourself a fee
> There's money in the trapper's trade
> And opportunity
> And you will be well found my lad
> A cherished employee
> Of the glorious, virtorious Ohio Company!
> CHORUS:
> It's ten percent for you my lad
> And twenty percent for me
> And the rest is for the glorious Ohio Company!
> Lord Dinwiddie has put his seal
> Upon our company
> And for the King he governs our Virginia Colony
> And so we're fully certified By the British sovereignty
> And we'll sell our furs and peltries to
> The petty bourgeoise!
> CHORUS:
> It's twenty percent for you my lad
> And thirty percent for me
> And the rest is for the glorious Ohio Company!
> Young man if fighting you enjoy
> brawl or jamboree
> There's men from Philadelph-i-ay
> With whom you'll not agree
> You'll have some lovely fighting
> As the cherished employee
> Of the glorious, uproarious Ohio Company!
> CHORUS:
> It's thirty percent for you my lad
> And forty percent for me
> And the rest is for the glorious Ohio Company!
> 
> Across the endless mountains
> With a pack horse you will go
> You'll come upon three rivers
> In a valley wide and low
> You'll barter with the Indians
> Exercise cupidity
> For the profit of our glorious Ohio Company
> CHORUS:
> It's forty percent for you my lad
> And fifty percent for me
> And the rest is for the glorious Ohio Company!
> The Indians have a famous queen
> And she is royalty
> She governs all six nations
> In the Indian territoree
> Her name is Allaquippa
> And she will exact a fee
> In muskets, rum and wampum from our glorious company!
> CHORUS
> It's fifty percent for you my lad
> And sixty percent for me
> And the rest is for the glorious Ohio Company!
> There's Iriquois and Seneca
> And Mingo and Shawnee
> You'll buy their mink and otter skins
> To send across the sea
> And as they skin the beaver
> Skin the red skins lad, for me
> And the glorious, notorious Ohio Company!
> CHORUS:
> It's sixty percent for you my lad
> And eighty percent for me
> And the rest is for the glorious Ohio Company!
> When you come back to Virginia
> A rich man you'll surely be
> You can pick and choose your doxies
> For to bounce upon your knee
> You may be a director and
> A life long legatee
> Of the glorious, notorious Ohio Company!
> CHORUS:
> It's eighty percent for you my lad
> And ninety percent for me
> And the rest is for the Glorious Ohio Company!
