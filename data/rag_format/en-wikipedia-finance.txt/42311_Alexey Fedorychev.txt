### Career

In 1987, he left the USSR. Fedorychev was involved in the railway sleeper trade, later became involved in the fertiliser trade and handled Uralkali's foreign trade operations. In December 1994, he registered a company Fedcom in Monaco, specialising in the export of sulphur and fertilisers from the former USSR. In the mid-1990s, the entrepreneur managed to sell sulphur from Astrakhangazprom on international markets. Fedcom has sponsored football clubs in the south of France since the second half of the 1990s. Active sponsorship activities and links to Eastern Europe aroused the suspicions of French law enforcers, but apart from forged passports on one of the firm's employees, no criminal elements were found in the activities; nevertheless, when Fedorychev offered to buy a controlling stake in the *AS Monaco FC* for €100 million in 2002, Prince Rainier III didn’t give his consent.

In the mid-2000s, he invested in a large agricultural holding in the Orel Oblast.

Between 2004 and 2007, Fedorychev's structures owned a controlling stake in *FC Dynamo Moscow*. Immediately after joining the team, Fedorychev began investing money in it: In the 2005 season the investment amounted to around $100 million, thanks to which the club bought or leased Portuguese players Maniche, Costinha, Nuno Espírito Santo, Nuno Frechaut, Jorge Ribeiro, Cícero Semedo, Luís Loureiro, Almami Moreira, Danny; Brazilians players Tiago Silva, Derlei, Jean, Jorge Luiz; Greek player Giourkas Seitaridis; Peruvian player Andres Mendoza and invited Brazilian coach Ivo Wortmann. There were also plans to build a new stadium and renovate the base in Novogorsk. However, two years after acquiring *FC Dynamo Moscow*, the entrepreneur lost interest in it. There were plans to buy the land in Petrovsky Park, which belonged to the club, but they failed to do so. The team incurred multi-million dollar debts and Fedorychev sold the club.

In January 2022, he became President of the *AS Monaco Basket*.
