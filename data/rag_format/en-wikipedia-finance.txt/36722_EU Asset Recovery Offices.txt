EU Asset Recovery Offices


# EU Asset Recovery Offices



The **European (EU) Union Asset Recovery Offices** (ARO) are national central contact points that facilitate EU-wide tracing of assets derived from crime.

Council Decision 2007/845/JHA (“The Decision”) obliges Member States to set up or designate such offices. It requests AROs to exchange information under the conditions laid down in Framework Decision 2006/960/JHA (“the Swedish Initiative”) and in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions.

The Decision is also intended to support the CARIN (Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network), a global network aimed at enhancing mutual knowledge about methods and techniques for cross-border identification, freezing, seizure and confiscation of illicitly acquired assets.

Member States are required to ensure that AROs cooperate with each other and help facilitating the tracing and identification of proceeds of crime and other crime related assets by exchanging information and best practices, both upon request and spontaneously. The exchange of information and best practices between AROs should take place regardless of their status (administrative, law enforcement or judicial authority). The purpose of AROs is to remove the financial gain from crime.
