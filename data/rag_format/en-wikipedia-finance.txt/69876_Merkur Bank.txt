# Merkur Bank



**Merkur Privatbank** is a German private bank with headquarters in Munich that is owner-managed.


## History

In 1959 Zanwel Horowicz as well as Motek and Hela Horowicz founded Merkur Bank Horowicz KG in Munich, which at that time was mainly limited to the sale of medals and currencies.

In 1986 a group of investors led by Siegfried Lingel took over the Merkur Bank Horowicz KG and rebranded it to MERKUR BANK GmbH & Co. KG. At the same time, MERKUR BANK GmbH & Co. KG began universal banking business with the main focus on property development financing, and in 1991 opened its first branches in Vogtland, Saxony and Thuringia. The service portfolio was expanded to include leasing refinancing in 1995.

As part of the IPO in 1999 at the Munich Stock Exchange, MERKUR BANK GmbH & Co. KG became MERKUR BANK KGaA. The generational change began in 2002, when Marcus Lingel was appointed to the extended management of MERKUR BANK KGaA as General Manager alongside management member Claus Herrmann. Following the departure of Siegfried Lingel, Marcus Lingel then took over as Chairman of the General Management of MERKUR BANK KGaA in 2008. In addition, however, he has continued to act as a personally liable partner of MERKUR BANK KGaA since October 2005, alongside his father Siegfried Lingel.

The business area of investment and financing for entrepreneurial investors was first established in 2016 and since the acquisition of the German Bankhaus Schilling & Co in 2019, has been a fundamental part of the banking business, especially for high net worth individuals.


### Takeover of Bank Schilling & Co. AG

In October 2019, MERKUR BANK took over significant parts of the banking business from the German bank Schilling & Co. and has since been operating under the new brand name of MERKUR PRIVATBANK.
