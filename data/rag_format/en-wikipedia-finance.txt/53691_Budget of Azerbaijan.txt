## Analysis of the legislative base of the state budget in the Republic of Azerbaijan

Budget processes are regulated by the budget law in any state. The budget legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan means the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan "On Budget System", laws on state budget adopted in accordance with the Law "On budget system" and other normative-legal acts, as well as international treaties wherein the Azerbaijan Republic is one of the parties. The legal status of the budget participants in the Republic of Azerbaijan is regulated by:

* The Law on the Budget System of the Republic of Azerbaijan (June 2, 2002)
* Special laws of the Republic of Azerbaijan and normative acts of local self-governing bodies.
* The order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
* Normative legal acts of the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
* Relevant acts of the State Executive Authority.

The first law on the budget system was adopted on December 1, 1992, and kept its legal force until 2002. In order to eliminate the existing gaps, a special law on the State Budget of the Republic of Azerbaijan was adopted on May 18, 1999. The adopted new law was meant to help the law "on the Budget System". Even though this law was adopted, the law on the budget system remained in force but lost its important documental function as a regulator of the processes.

The President of the Republic signed the second law "On the budget system" on July 2, 2002. The current "Budget System" law came into force on January 1, 2003 (with addition and amendments dated May 13, 2003; December 3, 2004; April 5, 2005; October 21, 2005; December 23, 2005; March 3, 2006; November 28, 2006; November 30, 2007; October 28, 2008; April 14, 2009; June 19, 2009; May 29, 2012; June 20, 2014; October 14, 2016; December 16, 2016; December 30, 2016), and as a result of the coming into force of the law, the above two normative acts lost their legal force.
