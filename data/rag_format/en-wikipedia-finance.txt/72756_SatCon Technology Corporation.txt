## History

In 1985 SatCon Technology Corporation was founded by Dave Eisenhaure, formerly of MIT/Draper Laboratory, to develop, market, and sell products required by the world’s growing need for cleaner and lower-cost energy and power. In 1992 the company’s CEO Dave Eisenhaure and CFO Mike Turmelle took the company public on the Nasdaq exchange (NASDAQ:SATC). After the company became public, it acquired eight private companies and one public company. The two most notable of these acquisitions were the former Westinghouse Electric Vehicle Group, which was acquired from Northrop Grumman, and Inverpower, a public Canadian company. These acquisitions and the parent company were reorganized into a diverse organization with four plants in the U.S. and Canada. SatCon provided products and services to major international companies, including Chrysler, General Motors, Ford, Litton, Fuel Cell Energy, Applied Materials, as well as major divisions of the U.S. armed forces. SatCon also created Beacon Power as a separate public company to commercialize flywheel energy storage products. Products developed by SatCon have contributed to the advancement of the utility, hybrid vehicle, ship building, industrial automation, semiconductor processing, and defense markets. SatCon is particularly well known for its work in advanced electric drives; in the technology of inverters for smart grid and photovoltaic applications; and in the development of light-weight, high-power electronics, which contributed to the development of practical hybrid and electric vehicles.

In 1995 SatCon and Chrysler were awarded the Discover Award for innovation in automotive engineering. This award was granted for the development of the drivetrain for Chrysler’s Patriot Race Car. The Patriot Race Car was built as a testbed for a turbine-electric flywheel hybrid drive train with a maximum output of 750 horsepower. SatCon was the prime contractor, designing and manufacturing the drive train and developing the needed technologies for its implementation. SatCon and Chrysler were nominated for and ultimately selected from numerous candidates for this award by a committee of automotive experts assembled by Discover Magazine.

In 2003, SatCon introduced the first 100 KW PV inverter in a single cabinet, PowerGate, and in the next five years introduced the 225 KW, 500 KW, and 1 MW series Inverters that convert the direct current (DC) power into usable alternating (AC)

Mike Turmelle, Dave Eisenhaure and Jim Kirtley have formed a new company TEK-Energy Systems. TEK-Energy Systems is composed of key members of the SatCon Technology Corporation team
