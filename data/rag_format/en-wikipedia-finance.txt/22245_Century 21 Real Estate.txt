## History

Century 21 Real Estate (Century 21) was founded in 1971 by two real estate agents, Art Bartlett and Marsh Fisher, in Orange County, California.

Here Bartlett reveals how they decided on the name:

> We were brainstorming at lunch one day - my former VP and I - and I said the name had to sound like it had been around for a long time. [...] My former VP suggested 20th Century Realty. I thought it would be impossible to get the name registered. He said 21st Realty, but I didn't like that. He then said, "How about Century 21?" I liked it, though it sounded futuristic. [...] I called Marsh and told him, but he thought it was too futuristic. He wanted Green Valley. Well, we finally agreed on Century 21, and we incorporated the company.

Century 21 was acquired by Trans World Corporation in 1979, when Trans World Corporation decided to focus on hospitality and housing. In 1985, MetLife acquired Century 21 from Trans World Corporation. When MetLife decided to leave the housing business, Century 21 was sold to Hospitality Franchise Systems (later Cendant) in 1995. When Cendant split in 2006, Century 21 became part of Realogy, now Anywhere Real Estate.


### 2018 Rebrand

In March of 2018, Century 21 Real Estate introduced a comprehensive rebranding campaign to modernize its image and address industry complacency. The initiative introduced a new logo with a refined gold and black color scheme in an effort to maintain relevance to consumers, while retaining their wide-scale brand recognition and appeal.

Century 21's rebranding campaign prominently featured the term "relentless" to underscore their commitment to exceptional service. This theme was integrated across various platforms, including a partnership with ESPN that highlighted "relentless moments" in sports, aligning the brand with the "pursuit of excellence". The company aimed to position itself as a "challenger brand" with a "relentless mindset," encouraging agents to consistently exceed client expectations.


### *The Joy of Home* Campaign

In November 2024, Century 21 Real Estate launched "The Joy of Home," a global marketing campaign and the most significant update to the brand since its 2018 rebrand. Century 21 cited shifts in consumer decision making towards community and connection as motivators behind the campaign, which features "more humanized" messaging and visual media.


## Legal cases

In 2019, Century 21's parent company Realogy was named as a co-conspirator in multiple class-action lawsuits alleging that it artificially inflated commissions paid by home sellers. In September 2023, it agreed to pay $83.5 million to settle two of the lawsuits. One of the cases, *Burnett v. National Association of Realtors*, went to trial the following month, where a federal jury found that the parent company did participate in the commissions conspiracy. The settlement agreement removed the requirement for Century 21 real estate agents to belong to the National Association of Realtors.
