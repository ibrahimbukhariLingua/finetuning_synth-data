Climateflation


# Climateflation



**Climateflation** is the contribution to inflation of added costs brought about as a result of climate change.


## Mechanisms

Food prices could rise by as much as 3% per year due to climate change impacts.

Energy prices are another of the most common examples cited of climateflation.

Natural disasters fueled by climate change have increased housing costs through insurance and by exacerbating housing shortages when those events make homes unlivable. Climate migration, where people are displaced from their homes destroyed by unusually extreme disasters like wildfire, has been increasing in the United States.


## Locations

Climateflation is expected to hit warmer parts of the globe more severely.
