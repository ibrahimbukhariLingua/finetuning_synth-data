## Argentine debt restructuring

On behalf of Barclays, Ferraro signed the 2008 Work Letter Agreement setting the terms of Argentina's debt restructuring, which was also signed by Juan Bruchou of Citibank, Marcelo Blanco of Deutsche Bank, and Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Ferraro, along with colleagues from Deutsche Bank and Citibank, had prepared the latest debt swap proposal 2009 “without compensation,” but with the understanding that they would eventually receive the customary commissions.

A November 2013 article noted that it was Ferraro who had had the “extravagant idea of getting the bondholders who entered the two exchanges to finance part of the payment to the holdouts, with the idea of avoiding a new default that would liquefy their holdings.” *La Nación* noted in November 2013 that Gramercy was one of five favored companies that were being paid as a result of ICSID (International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes) arbitration.
