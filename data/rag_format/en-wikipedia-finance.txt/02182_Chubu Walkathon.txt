Chubu Walkathon


# Chubu Walkathon



The **Chubu Walkathon and International Charity Festival** is a foreign organized charity event started in 1991 in Nagoya, Japan, by members of the now-defunct American Business Community Nagoya (ABCN); in November 2000 the ABCN merged with and became the Chūbu region chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce Japan (ACCJ).

The event was originally called the *Nagoya Walkathon*. Held annually on a Sunday in May this event is sponsored by the ACCJ and Nagoya International School (NIS). Its main purpose is to join the international community with Japanese friends and companies in raising money for local orphanages and charities.
