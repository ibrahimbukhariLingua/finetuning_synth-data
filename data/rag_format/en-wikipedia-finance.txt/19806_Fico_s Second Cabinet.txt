Fico's Second Cabinet


# Fico's Second Cabinet



**Robert Fico's Second Cabinet** is the former government of Slovakia, headed by prime minister Robert Fico. Appointed on 4 April 2012, it consists of 14 members, 11 from the Direction - Social Democracy party (Slovak: *Smer-SD*) and three independents. It replaced Iveta Radicova's cabinet after gaining an absolute majority in the Slovak parliament following the 2012 Slovak parliamentary election.

This was the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia that any party had won an absolute majority, though Smer-SD fell seven seats short of a three-fifths majority to unilaterally amend the constitution.

Fico's Second Cabinet was replaced by Fico's Third Cabinet on 23 March 2016.
