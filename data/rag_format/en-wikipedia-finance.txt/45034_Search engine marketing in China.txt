Search engine marketing in China


# Search engine marketing in China



As of 2010, the largest internet enterprises in China were Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba followed by Soso, Sogou, Bing, and Yahoo. In March 2010, Google which had been in the list from 2000, was forced to pull out from China because of a heated dispute with the Chinese Government regarding the censoring of search engine results.

China also has banned Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. There are local Chinese versions available in the form of Sina Weibo and Youku.

The Great China Firewall's presence obviates international businesses from gaining a foothold in China's online market. This gives local businesses the opportunity to compete against each other. It also allows them to create their own platforms that can rival their western counterparts. An example of this is Baidu, China's search engine comparable to Google. Baidu controls 76% percent of China's market share.

## China's media environment

While having their own popular social media platforms, their contents differ compared to the western counterparts. Sina Weibo, China's Twitter, centers around retweeting the same topic over and over. Though it lacks in variety, the post itself will gain a large visibility among users. Whereas, Twitter focuses on current events that circulate for a short time.

It is often advised to monitor the sources carefully when comparing reviews of the competitor's, as well, your own. A misstep can be made when coming with a conclusion based on faulty information gathered without careful examination.

Because of the different environment, it is best to adapt to the new domain, and reconfigure your strategy. Competition between locals is the norm: Various platforms Youku and Tudou, Sina Weibo and Weixin, Renren and Kaixin001 etc.
are some of the largest companies comparing against each other in their field.
