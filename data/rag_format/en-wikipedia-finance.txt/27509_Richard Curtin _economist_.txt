## Research


### Consumer sentiment surveys

Curtin has directed the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment surveys since 1976. The surveys are focused on innovation regarding the conceptualization, measurement, and selection of important economic topics, along with the data analysis.

The sentiment surveys have been replicated by over six dozen countries, including the countries for which Curtin helped to establish or improve the consumer surveys.


### Formation of expectations

Curtin advanced an interdisciplinary theory on the formation of expectations that reconciles the economist's rational expectations hypothesis and the psychologist's bounded rationality theory. Curtin found that expectations are formed naturally and automatically by everyone and that evolutionary development has provided people with an efficient means to form expectations by using their full mental faculties, including their conscious and nonconscious cognitive abilities, their emotional resources, and through social interactions. The primary evolutionary purpose of expectations is to enable the efficient use of conscious deliberation. According to him, expectations help to decide how each new piece of information is handled. Rather than based on national statistics, consumers predominantly use private information based on their daily interactions with the economy and other people. Whereas traditional theory holds that expectations are formed independent of their use in decisions, Curtin's new theory holds that expectations are context sensitive, and vary by how sensitive the decision is the accuracy of an expectation.


### Impact on macroeconomy

Curtin also conducted research regarding macroeconomy. Conventional theory holds that the consumer plays no independent role in whether the recession or growth of the economy. Orthodox theory holds that the consumer cannot directly cause recessions since consumer behavior is completely determined by other economic factors, such as wages, prices, interest rates, and the like. According to Curtin, economics have ignored the fact that consumers have generally invested as much or more than business in new plants (houses) and equipment (vehicles, durables, etc.) to improve output (living standards). He found that consumer investments accounted for 12.2% of GDP from 1930 to 2019 compared with 11.2% among business firms over the same period. His study also indicated that changes in consumer spending generally occurred before changes in business investments. Curtin has argued that it is much more likely that it is prospects for consumer demand that motivates firms to invest and produce, and that this line of causation is more consistent with economic theory.


### Entrepreneurship

Curtin, along with Paul Reynolds, designed the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics research program focused on understanding the process of business formation. Curtin and Reynolds selected samples of nascent entrepreneurs and interviewed them on an annual basis to provide annual updates of their efforts to start new businesses.
