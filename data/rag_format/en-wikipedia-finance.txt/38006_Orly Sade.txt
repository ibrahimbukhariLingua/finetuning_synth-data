In 2024, Sade initiated the project "In Their Memory and Honor" to commemorate the fallen women of Operation Iron Swords, in collaboration with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Clal Insurance. As part of the project, a connection was established between female reservist students from the School of Business Administration at the Hebrew University and the families of the women from the security forces who fell during Operation Iron Swords. The students and the families met at a memorial ceremony, where the families awarded scholarships to the participating students, sponsored by Clal Insurance.
