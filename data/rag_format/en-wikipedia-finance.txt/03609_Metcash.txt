## History

In 1927, Joe David founded his first corner store in Woolloomooloo, Sydney trading as davids. Having expanded to six stores, in 1935 Davids opened a wholesale warehouse in Redfern. In 1966, Davids enters the liquor market purchasing Harbottle Brown & Co. In 1980, the AG Campbells wholesale business is acquired. In 1987 the business was renamed Australian Liquor Marketers. In 2000, it was rebranded Metcash.

In 2005, Metcash and Woolworths purchased Foodland. Under the agreement, Foodland was divided into two with Metcash acquiring most of the Australian operations and Woolworths acquiring the New Zealand operations and 22 supermarkets in Australia.

In 2012, Metcash took a majority share in Automotive Brands Group, which operated the Autobarn and Autopro chain of stores, for $53 million and incorporated it into its automotive division. The company then sold its automotive division to Burson Group (now Bapcor) in 2015 for $275 million. The chief executive officer of the automotive division was Supercar driver Paul Dumbrell.

In February 2024, Metcash announced that it had signed three acquisition agreements (Superior Food Group; Bianco Construction Supplies; Alpine Truss) cumulatively valued at approximately USD$558.5 million.
