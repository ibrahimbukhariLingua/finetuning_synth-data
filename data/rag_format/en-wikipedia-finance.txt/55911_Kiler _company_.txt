The supermarkets are the central business interest of Kiler Holding, which consists of 22 companies with more than 5,000 employees, operating in the retail trade, real estate development, tourism and health sectors. Since 2000, the real estate interests of the group have been managed by a separate company, Kiler Gayrimenkul, and more recently for development of residential buildings and shopping centres.
