Spesmilo


# Spesmilo



The ***spesmilo*** (pronounced [spesˈmilo], plural ***spesmiloj*** [spesˈmiloi̯]) is an obsolete decimal international currency, proposed in 1907 by René de Saussure and used before World War I by a few British and Swiss banks, primarily the Ĉekbanko Esperantista.

The *spesmilo* was equivalent to one thousand *spesoj*, and worth 0.733 grams (0.0259 oz) of pure gold (0.8 grams of 22 karat gold), which at the time was about one-half United States dollar, two shillings (one-tenth of a pound sterling) in Britain, one Russian ruble, or 2+1⁄2 Swiss francs. On 6 November 2022, that quantity of gold would be worth about US$43.50, £38 sterling, €44, ₽2692 Russian roubles, and SFr 43 Swiss francs.

The basic unit, the *speso* (from Italian *spesa* or German *Spesen*; *spesmilo* is Esperanto for "a thousand pennies"), was purposely made very small to avoid fractions.


## Sign

The *spesmilo* sign, called *spesmilsigno* in Esperanto, is a monogram of a cursive capital "S", from whose tail emerges an "m". The currency sign is often typeset as the separate letters *Sm*.

In Unicode, the character is assigned U+20B7 ₷ SPESMILO SIGN in version 5.2.


## Miscellaneous

* The *stelo* was another currency unit used by the Universal League [eo] from 1942 to the 1990s.
* An Esperanto version of the board game Monopoly uses play money in denominations of *spesmiloj*.
