## History

ACPI was initially established as ACP Partners in 2001 by Alok Oberoi and Joseph Sassoon, both former partners of Goldman Sachs, in order to manage their own assets. At Goldman Sachs, Oberoi was the Head of International Private Wealth Management, and Sassoon was the Head of European Private Wealth Management. Whilst Joseph retired from ACPI, Alok remained as Chairman of the ACPI Group and is actively involved in the running of the business. Brett Lankester joined ACPI Partners from Goldman Sachs in 2007 and is CEO.

Today, ACPI deals in all major asset classes including multi-manager, equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. ACPI focuses on capital preservation and active portfolio management on an absolute return basis.
UBP (Union Bancaire Privee) acquired ACPI in January 2019.
