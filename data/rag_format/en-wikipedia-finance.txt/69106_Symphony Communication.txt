# Symphony Communication



**Symphony** is an instant messaging service designed for use by financial firms. The software features include workplace chat, voice calling, video conferencing, encryption, and support for third-party plugins. Symphony is developed by Symphony Communication Services.


## History

The technology was initially developed by Goldman Sachs as an internal messaging system called Live Current. In October 2014, Goldman Sachs and 14 other financial institutions invested $66 million to establish Symphony Communication Services LLC and acquire Perzo, Inc., a secure communication application known for its end-to-end encryption messaging.

Perzo was founded by David Gurle in 2012, and he served as Symphony's CEO from 2014 to 2021. Gurle played a role in developing communication solutions for Skype, Thomson Reuters, and Microsoft.

Symphony 2.0 was announced during the company's annual Innovate Conference in New York City in October 2019. The release of software components called Elements aimed to facilitate the development of custom applications on the Symphony platform. Symphony 2.0 was launched one year later.

By 2020, Symphony claimed to have amassed over 400,000 users on its platform.

Brad Levy joined Symphony in July 2020 as the president and chief commercial officer. In June 2021, he assumed the role of chief executive officer after former founder David Gurle stepped down from the executive position. Levy had previous experience working at Goldman Sachs and IHS Markit before joining Symphony.
