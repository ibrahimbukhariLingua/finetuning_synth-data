## Career

Wai Hun started her career as a consultant at Ernst & Young. She subsequently switched to a business analyst position at Sistemaju before joining Sapura to develop and implement business intelligence solutions. At Sapura, Wai Hun met John Lim, a Malaysian software developer who would eventually become the Chief Technological Officer of JurisTech.

Wai Hun and John Lim started Natsoft(M) Sdn Bhd, the parent company of JurisTech in 1997 amidst the Asian Financial Crisis. Their company was initially poised to sell data mining, AI, and data analytics tools and services to banks. However, the initial offering was not successful because the markets were not ready for data mining and AI solutions at the time, and additionally, few companies could afford such services in the immediate aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis. Then Wai Hun and John Lim decided to offer debt collection and litigation software to cope with existing market needs.
