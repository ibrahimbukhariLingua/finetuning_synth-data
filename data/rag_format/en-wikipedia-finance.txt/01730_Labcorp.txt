## Acquisition history


## Controversies


### Overbilling the government

In 1992, the company was one of the first to be prosecuted as part of Operation Labscam, a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the healthcare system initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, California. The company and others were accused of routinely submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests on blood samples that physicians had never ordered. In addition, charges for the tests billed to the government were significantly higher than what the company charged private insurers. That year, the company agreed to pay $111 million to settle claims. In November 1996, the company agreed to pay a total of $182 million as a result of the investigation.

In February 2023, the company paid $19 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act of 1863 by its submission of false claims to Medicare.


### Conflicts of interest

In 2012, Labcorp was criticized for its practice of paying the salaries of genetic counselors in hospitals and doctors' offices, which is perceived to be a possible conflict of interest.


### Data breaches

In July 2018, Labcorp's servers were affected by a variant of the SamSam ransomware, with the goal of locking or disabling computers and servers to prevent access to data. The attack resulted in delays, but no data was believed to have been stolen. The malware was blocked on the network by midnight on July 14, 2018.


### Faulty paternity tests

Labcorp has been criticized over faulty paternity tests, many of which have resulted in lawsuits. The most notable case was the 2005 false accusation of Washington hairdresser Andre Chreky, who spent $200,000 and years in court proving, despite a false-positive test, that he was not the father. In the trial, it was determined that only five people at Labcorp reviewed data and made paternity determinations, including during 10 hour shifts that required making determinations every 4 minutes.


### Sharing of patient data

In 2024, Labcorp faced a class action lawsuit for allowing Google to collect confidential patient information such as appointments made and website login details.


### Labor concerns

Employees have criticized the company's productivity goals, in which they say volume and speed of work done is prioritized over quality. Labs face staffing shortages and employees say they are overworked.

Labcorp has been criticized for its process of having all employees terminated upon hospital laboratory management acquisitions, and making them reapply with LabCorp, thereby losing accrued employee benefits, including employee eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) in the case of non-profit hospitals.

In 2024, Labcorp stated that its goal is to "operate the company in a non-union environment." After Labcorp became the manager of laboratories of Legacy Health, outsourced laboratory personnel unionized with the Oregon Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals.


## Aircraft

Labcorp (ICAO: **SKQ**, call sign: **SKYLAB**) utilizes a fleet of 12 Pilatus PC-12 and a single Pilatus PC-24 aircraft on nightly runs from Burlington for use on the East Coast. Prior to the acquisition of PC-12 aircraft Labcorp utilized seven PA-31-350s.
