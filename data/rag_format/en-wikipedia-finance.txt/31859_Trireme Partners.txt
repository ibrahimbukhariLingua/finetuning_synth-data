## History and investors

Perle set up Trireme Partners in 2001. Trireme Partners first sought an investment from Boeing in February 2002. Boeing committed to invest $20 million two months later. The company received a $2.5 million investment from Hollinger International Inc. in 2003 which was reportedly never reported to the audit committee.


## Criticism

In March 2003, Perle became embroiled in controversy after *The New Yorker* published an article by Seymour Hersh describing a meeting between Perle, the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and Saudi businessman Harb Zuhair, in which Perle allegedly offered to influence American foreign policy in Saudi Arabia in exchange for investment in Trireme. The U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General investigated the conflict of interest and determined that Perle did not violate the conflict of interest provision because he was only working eight days per annum at the Defense Department at the time, which was less than the 60 days of service requirement.
