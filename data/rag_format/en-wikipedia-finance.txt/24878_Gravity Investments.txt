## Modern portfolio theory

The underlying portfolio optimization process is an offshoot of modern portfolio theory; it uses diversification optimization to create diversification-weighted portfolios and provides tools for portfolio analysis. Once a portfolio is plugged in, it allows advisers to holistically determine which asset classes clients are too invested in and which ones may broaden the portfolio.
