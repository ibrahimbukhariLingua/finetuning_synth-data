ICCREA Banca


# ICCREA Banca



**ICCREA Group**, known formerly as **Istituto Centrale delle Casse Rurali ed Artigiane**, is a central institution of Italian credit unions and rural savings banks. The holding company of the group was **ICCREA Holding** (from 1995 to 2016), while ICCREA Banca, ICCREA BancaImpresa, and several other companies were subsidiaries. However, **ICCREA Banca** merged with ICCREA Holding in mid-2016 as part of the banking reform in Italy. The co-operative banks of Italy would create strong central banks (Cassa Centrale Banca had also applied to be another central bank) with power to recapitalize individual co-operative banks.

ICCREA has been designated as a significant institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.
