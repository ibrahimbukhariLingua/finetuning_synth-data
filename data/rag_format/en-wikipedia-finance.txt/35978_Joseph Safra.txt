## Early life

Joseph Safra was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon to a Jewish family that, according to Safra family's own sources, originally came from Aleppo, Syria, and with banking connections dating back to Ottoman times. The family's banking history began in Aleppo with the foundation of the family’s first banking house in 1841, Aleppo was one of the major hubs of commerce and a mandatory route from the East to Europe, and from the latter to Persia and inner Asia. The Safra family financed trade and exchanged currencies for tradesmen, who came to the city through the desert and the Mediterranean. The Safra family moved to Brazil in 1952.
