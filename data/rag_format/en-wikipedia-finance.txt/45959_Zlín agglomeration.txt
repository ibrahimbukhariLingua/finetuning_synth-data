Zlín agglomeration


# Zlín agglomeration



The **Zlín agglomeration** (Czech: *Zlínská aglomerace*) is the agglomeration of the city of Zlín and its surroundings in the Czech Republic. It was defined in 2020 as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds and is valid in 2021–2027. The agglomeration has a population of about 130,000 and also includes the town of Otrokovice.


## Definition

The Zlín agglomeration was first defined in 2014 by the Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic for the purposes of the Integrated Land Development Plans, which was a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. The agglomeration comprised 11 municipalities with about 107,000 inhabitants and had an area of 213 km² (82 sq mi).

The current Zlín agglomeration was defined in 2020 by the Ministry of Regional Development for the purposes of the so-called Integrated Territorial Investment (ITI), which is a newer tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds.

The territory was defined on the basis of a coefficient composed of three methods: integrated system of centres (i.e. delineation of commuting flows based on mobile operator data from 2019), time spent in core cities (based on mobile operator data from 2019) and residential suburbanization zones (based on statistics of realized housing construction and directional migration from the core of the agglomeration to suburban municipalities in the period 2009–2016). The scope of the territory is valid for the period 2021–2027.
