# Revolver Co-operative



**Revolver Co-operative**, trading under the brand **Revolver World**, is a cooperative based in Wolverhampton, United Kingdom that imports and markets Fairtrade-certified coffee and organic cotton goods. It is a sister organisation to Revolver Music.


## Structure

Revolver Co-operative is incorporated as an industrial and provident society under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965. It is a multistakeholder co-operative in that membership is open to both suppliers, such as the farmer cooperatives, as well as consumers and other private individuals.


## Activities

Revolver Co-operative sells direct via its website, and via the retail outlets of consumer co-operatives (such as Central England Co-operative, Midcounties Co-operative, Heart of England Co-operative and Penrith Co-operative) and worker co-operatives (such as Unicorn Grocery and Infinity Foods Co-operative).

It sources Fairtrade coffee direct from farming cooperatives in Brazil, Colombia, Tarraz√∫ in Costa Rica, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Tanzania, and Uganda. By way of the Fairtrade premium paid to the farmers, 25% of profits are reinvested into the producers' communities to improve health and education.
