Revenue stamps of Argentina


# Revenue stamps of Argentina



Argentina has been one of the most prolific issuers of revenue stamps. Stamps have been issued by both the Argentine Republic and individual Argentine provinces and covered a wide range of duties from taxes on documents to hat taxes. The stamps form one of the most complex studies in revenue philately and have been exhaustively catalogued by Clive Ackerman in six volumes. However, new discoveries continue to be made.


## First revenue stamps

The first revenue stamps of the Republic were issued on 1 January 1878 for documentary taxes and taxes on foreign bills. Revenue stamps had been issued in the provinces from an earlier date and stamped paper had been in use since Spanish colonial times.
