## History

(Basque for 'Bilbao Biscay Savings Bank') was a Spanish savings bank based in the province of Biscay in the Basque Country, Spain. Its full name was **Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa, Aurrezki Kutxa eta Bahitetxea** (in Spanish **Caja Bilbao Vizcaya, Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad**). It was formed in 1990 when the Caja de Ahorros Municipal de Bilbao and the Bizkaiko Aurrezki Kutxa-Caja de Ahorros Vizcaína were merged. The company headquarters were in Bilbao. On 1 January 2012 it merged with other Basque financial entities (a "loose merger"), Kutxa and Caja Vital Kutxa, to form Kutxabank.

BBK won a bid to take over CajaSur on 16 July 2010. The transaction created the 7th largest financial institution of Spain.

The savings bank had minority investments in the following companies: Iberdrola 6,84%, Euskaltel 33,99%, Enagas 5%, Red Eléctrica 2,2%.

On September 16, 2011, the extraordinary assembly of BBK approved the creation of Kutxabank, through which it has been conducting its financial activities since January 1, 2012. Kutxabank was established through a SIP (Sistema Institucional de Protección) alongside Caja Vital and Kutxa.

On June 30, 2014, the General Assembly of BBK approved the transformation of the entity into a banking foundation, in accordance with the Law on Savings Banks and Banking Foundations.
