Health insurance premium index


# Health insurance premium index



The **Health insurance premium index** collects data on the evolution of premiums for compulsory and complementary health insurance and is the weighted average of the two sub-indices. By means of the Health insurance premium index, the effects of the evolution of premiums on the growth of households' disposable income can be calculated.

In Switzerland, the Health insurance premium index is compiled by the Federal Social Insurance Office (for the basic health insurance) and by the Federal Statistical Office (for the field of supplementary insurances).


## Legal basis

The legal basis of the Health Insurance Premium Index is the Federal Statistics Act of 9 October 1992 (BStatG) and the Ordinance of 30 June 1993 on the Conduct of Statistical Surveys by the Confederation.


## Type of survey
