# Corporate sector of Pakistan



The **Corporate sector of Pakistan** (otherwise attributed as the **Corporatization**; or/ simply referred to as the **Pakistan Inc.**) is an elite business sector expanded in financial cities of Pakistan, and a policy measure programme in the economic period of Pakistan. This programme is also regarded as "*Pakistan Inc.*", which is a common term used by the mass-media of Pakistan to refer to the corporate sector of the nation. The current policy measure programme is the *Companies Ordinance 2016* that legally allows a variety of formations in the mixed economy of Pakistan.

The programme was originally based on the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which was replaced by the Companies Ordinance 1984, finally being replaced by the current Companies Ordinance 2016 in a vision to promote Western-styled corporate sector, and business activities development in Pakistan. The corporate sector came in direct response to nationalization programme of executed Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party to promote . This programme was integrated in Privatization programme of Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1990 who gave free hand to private sector to expand the economical activities in the country. The corporate sector remained to expand in Prime minister Benazir Bhutto's government who promoted the nationalization and privatization at once. In 2004, in a programme initiated by Prime minister Shaukat Aziz, the corporate sector further enhanced and matured; it had built a strong and sizeable sector in the financial hubs of the country.

Under Aziz, many of state-owned megacorporations along with private sector had been registered in stock exchanges of the country in order to promote business competition in the country.
