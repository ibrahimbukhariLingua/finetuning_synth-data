Investor AB


# Investor AB



**Investor AB** is a Swedish investment and holding company, often considered a *de facto* conglomerate. One of Sweden's largest companies, Investor AB serves as the investment arm of the prominent Swedish Wallenberg family; the family's companies are involved in a variety of industries, of which the primary industries are pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and industry.

Investor AB is Sweden's most valuable publicly traded company; it has major or controlling holdings in several of Sweden's other largest companies. It has numerous investments worldwide through Patricia Industries and EQT AB.


## History

Investor AB was established in Stockholm when new Swedish legislation made it more difficult for banks to own stocks in industrial companies on a long-term basis. The shareholdings of the Wallenberg family bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, were transferred to Investor AB, a newly formed industrial holding company spun off from the bank, which would serve as the family's investment arm henceforth.
