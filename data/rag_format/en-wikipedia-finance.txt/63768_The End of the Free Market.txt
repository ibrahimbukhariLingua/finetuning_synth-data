The End of the Free Market


# The End of the Free Market



***The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?*** is a 2010 non-fiction book by Ian Bremmer, that discusses the rise of state capitalism, a system in which governments dominate local economies through ownership of market-dominant companies and large pools of excess capital, using them for political gain. This trend, Bremmer argues, challenges America's economic strength and the conduct of free markets everywhere.
