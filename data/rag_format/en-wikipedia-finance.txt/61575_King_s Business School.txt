## History

The School of Management & Business was founded in King's College London in 1989. In 1994, the school achieved departmental status and was formally established as the School of Management & Business in 2015 and began offering undergraduate degree programmes.

Since the acquisition of Bush House in a bid to expand the university's Strand Campus, KBS moved to the new building in August 2017 formally as the ninth faculty of the university. In 2023, the school achieved triple accreditation, adding AMBA accreditation for the MSc in International Management to the AACSB and EQUIS accreditations already held.


## Degree programs

## Student life

All students of KCL are automatically members of the King's College London Student Union (KCLSU).


### King's Business Club

In 2008, Zain Jaffer, later the founder of Vungle, established the university's first student-led business society, King's Business Club (formerly known as KCL Business Club). It claims to be the longest continuously running student organisation of its kind in the country. With a student membership of more than 3000 at King's College London alone, it is the largest business and finance society in London. The student initiative's core principles are to inspire, educate, and connect fellow students towards prospective career paths. King's Business Club achieves these goals by organising keynotes with prominent figures such as Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, company visits to offices of the Bulge Bracket and the Big Three, and international conferences and competitions.
