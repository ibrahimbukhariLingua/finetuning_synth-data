## History

In October 2011, TAV Airports was put for sale for €2 billion, with Credit Suisse handling the bid process. On March 12, 2012, TAV announced the planned sale of 38% of the firm's issued share capital to the group Aéroports de Paris for a total consideration of US$874 million. The sale value was determined based on the 32% premium of the company's latest closing price. The two companies provide service for 180 million passengers at 37 airports in total. Board Member and President & CEO Sani Sener continued in his position.

In January 2015, TAV Airports won the bid on the $1.1 billion project to increase Bahrain International Airport's capacity from 4 to 14 million, with a 51-month engagement to build it. In October 2015, TAV Airports won a 20-year lease of the Milas–Bodrum Airport with the bid price of €717 million. In the US, TAV made an entry by winning the bid for the duty-free areas of the George Bush Intercontinental Airport.

In January 2016, Sani Sener, CEO of TAV Airports Holding, announced its intention to penetrate the Iranian market. As of August 2016, TAV Airports was in negotiation with the Cuban government to create a consortium along with the French company Bouygues for the expansion and management of La Havana's José Martí International Airport. The deal would also include the development of the San Antonio de los Baños Airfield.
