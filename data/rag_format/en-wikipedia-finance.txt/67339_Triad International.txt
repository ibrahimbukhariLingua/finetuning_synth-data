Triad International


# Triad International



**Triad International** is a Swiss multi-national private investment corporation that was owned by the late Adnan Khashoggi. Its investments include many notable properties and businesses throughout the World. The company consisted of subsidiary companies, including Triad Management, Triad Properties, Triad Energy, Triad Technology, and Triad Financial resources.

The global span of the businesses prompted the creation by the Khashoggi family of a board-game called Triopoly which was modelled after the classic game of Monopoly. The various game tiles represented properties and companies owned by Khashoggi and his Triad corporation. The game was manufactured and given to family and friends.
