## Early life and education

Lake was born on December 24, 1982, in San Francisco. Her mother is a Japanese immigrant who taught in the public school system and her father was a doctor at UCSF and the University of Minnesota. She initially wanted to become a doctor before she became an entrepreneur. She began on the pre-med course but became very interested in economics and business.

Lake received her bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 2005 and earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 2011.


## Career

Lake worked at Polyvore and management consultancy The Parthenon Group after graduating from Stanford.

While pursuing her MBA from Harvard, Lake founded Stitch Fix in 2011 at the age of 28. Lake collected SurveyMonkey data from her clients to get a sense of their style. She would use the information to hand select outfits and send them to her customers. At its early stages, Lake did not even have the Internet capabilities to charge her customers and required trust from her clients to pay her monthly. In 2012, Lake was introduced to Netflix VP of data science and engineering Eric Colson, who initially dismissed the business model as "whimsical" but within months joined the company as "chief algorithms officer". She has combined data science with marketing to grow the business.ᵛᵃᵍᵘᵉ
