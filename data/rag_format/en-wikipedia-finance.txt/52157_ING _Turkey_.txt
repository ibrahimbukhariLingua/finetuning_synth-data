## History

US-based First National Bank of Boston opened a branch in Istanbul, Turkey in 1984. The bank has operated independently since 1990 with three companies owning majority stakes: Alarko, Cerrahoğlu and Oyak.

The bank's name changed to Turkish Boston Bank A.Ş. again in 1991 and then OYAK purchased the other shares, becoming the only shareholder of the bank. Finally, the bank was again renamed to Oyak Bank in 1996.

In 2002, Sümerbank merged into Oyak Bank, which had over 300 branches around Turkey. The bank has a branch in Ireland and another one in Germany.
