## History


### Founder and company foundation

The company's founder Antony Stephen Baird was born in 1942 at the family ancestral home in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Shortly, after World War II, the family moved to London and he began bartering coins at school. However, it was not until 1967, and the launch of the South African krugerrand, that he took up coin dealing as a full-time occupation.

By the mid-70s Tony had established a permanent office in Stratford and would often drive to Switzerland in his E-Type Jaguar to collect thousands of gold coins. On 1 April 1982 VAT was applied to gold coins at the going rate of 15% (it was subsequently removed on 1 January 2000) and the following collapse of the UK gold coin market encouraged Tony to diversify into other gold products, particularly jewellery manufacturing and producing gold bars.

1987 saw the opening of their first branch in Hatton Garden where they provided over the counter cash trade. Baird & Co. moved to their brand new refinery in 2008 to accommodate the Olympics in Stratford. Baird & Co. remains privately owned.
Tony Baird died on 12 April 2015. He is survived by his wife Lorena and two sons Alex and Carlos. His funeral was held on 10 September 2015 and was attended by several LBMA members.
