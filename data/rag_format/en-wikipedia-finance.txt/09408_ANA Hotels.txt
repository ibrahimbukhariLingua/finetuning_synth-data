# ANA Hotels



**ANA Hotels** (全日空ホテルズ, **Zen'nikkū Hoteruzu**) is a Japanese hotel chain established in 1973 by All Nippon Airways (ANA). In October 2006, ANA sold majority ownership of ANA Hotels to the InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), which is now the primary shareholder. The managed properties of ANA Hotels are marketed under the ANA InterContinental, ANA Crowne Plaza, ANA Hotels and ANA Holiday Inn brands.


## History

ANA Hotels has been a hotel management company since its establishment in 1973 as a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. The airline owned hotels in Japan and, in the 1980s and 1990s, the United States.

On 23 October 2006, the sale of ANA Hotels to InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) resulted in ANA Hotels becoming mainly owned by IHG, which holds 74% shares in the company, while All Nippon Airways retains 25%; with 1% held by other investors.

On 30 November 2006, ANA Hotels Company Ltd. was renamed to "IHG ANA Hotels Group Japan LLC." to further establish its business description as a hotel operator.

On 13 April 2007, All Nippon Airways sold its 13 domestic hotels to Morgan Stanley for about 280 billion yen. Following its acquisition, the operating rights of each hotel acquired by Morgan Stanley will be unified into "Panorama Hotels One" which was newly established by Panorama Hospitality, a subsidiary company of Morgan Stanley. After that, however, it was split into three companies: Panorama Hotels One Inc., Horizon Hotels One Inc., and Central Hotels Inc. These facilities were gradually withdrawn from capital by sale. In July 2015, Horizon Hotels was sold to Hoshino Resorts, and the transfer to other operating companies was completed.


## Brands

Operating under the "IHG ANA Group Hotels", ANA Hotels has managed 33 properties in Japan, with a total inventory of 10,000 guest rooms, 8 InterContinental or ANA InterContinental branded hotels, 19 ANA Crowne Plaza branded hotels and 6 ANA Holiday Inn branded hotels. Since 2007, its acquisition by InterContinental Hotels Group has increased the total guest rooms networked.
