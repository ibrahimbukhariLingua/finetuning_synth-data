## History

Founded in 2005 by Philip E. Morgaman, who served as chairman and chief executive until 2008 and remained Chairman until 2009 when he sold his interest in the company. He was succeeded as CEO by Jonathan (Mac) Gamse and later as chairman by Christopher Hoehn-Saric. At the time of this transition, Meritas had grown from a concept to 19 campuses with approximately 14,000 students. Meritas has purchased multiple schools worldwide. Its first acquisition, in 2005, was North Broward Preparatory School, in Coconut Creek, Florida. Collège du Léman, located in Geneva, Switzerland was the next school to join the Meritas family in 2006.

As of April 27, 2015, Meritas has sold several of their acquired schools to Nord Anglia Education (NAE) including, North Broward Prep, Collège du Léman, Léman International, The Village School, Windermere Prep, Instituto San Roberto. It is unclear whether the remaining Meritas schools will be acquired by NAE.
