## History

The firm was founded in 1903 by William Bagley (1860-1938), an attorney and the designated master of ceremonies when William D. Hoard was inaugurated as the 16th Governor of Wisconsin in 1888. The firm as it exists today is the result of a 1994 merger between two Madison firms, DeWitt Porter and Ross & Stevens. Ross & Stevens brought expertise in employee benefits and intellectual property law, and DeWitt Porter brought environmental law and lobbying practices. Jack R. DeWitt, a founding partner, died in 2012. In 2013 DeWitt Ross & Stevens combined with the Minneapolis, Minnesota law firm of Mackall Crounse & Moore.
