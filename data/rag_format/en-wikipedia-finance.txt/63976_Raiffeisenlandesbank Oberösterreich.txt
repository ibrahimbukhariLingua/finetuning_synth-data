## History

The bank was founded in the 20th century as an office for equalization payments and monetary equalization.

The bank moved into the *Südbahnhofmarkt* location under the name *Raiffeisen Zentralkasse*. In the following years *Raiffeisen Zentralkasse's* field of activity and locations were expanded. In 1988, the bank's name changed from *Raiffeisen Zentralkasse Oberösterreich* to *Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberösterreich*. A year later, a ground-breaking ceremony took place for the extension to Linz's *Südbahnhof* railway station, which was completed in 1990. In the same year, a representative office was opened in Budweis.

In 1991, the opening of a bank in the German city of Passau laid the foundation for successful business development in Bavaria, Germany. Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberösterreich now has eight branches in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg: Augsburg, Passau, Nuremberg, Munich, Regensburg, Würzburg, Ulm and Heilbronn. Its developmental achievements in Germany have been honored several times with the "Bank of the Year" award in the *Großer Preis des Mittelstandes* competition.

Raiffeisenbank A.S., in which Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberösterreich has a stake, was founded in the Czech Republic in 1993. Another division was established in 1995 with the founding of *Privat Bank AG*, which offers customers sophisticated private banking and many special services. *Kepler Fonds KAG* was founded in 1998. Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberösterreich was transformed into a public limited company in 2004.

From 1985 to 2012, Ludwig Scharinger was CEO and chairman of the managing board of Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberösterreich. Heinrich Schaller succeeded him in this function on March 31, 2012.
