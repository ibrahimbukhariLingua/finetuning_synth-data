## Plot

The story depicts the daily lives of Kaoru Ushijima, the manager of the ultra-violent, 10-day, 50% interest black-market finance company "Cow Cow Finance," and his employees, as well as the various human situations of the customers who visit Cow Finance and their relations, and the dark side of society. The story is told from the viewpoint of the main characters in each episode, and Ushijima is a kind of a rhapsodist who comes into contact with these characters. Therefore, there are many episodes in which Ushijima does not appear at all [Note 2]. The title "XX-kun" was inspired by the naming of automatic contracting machines for salaries, such as "Mujinkun" (Acom) and "O-auto-san" (Aiful), which were popular at the time.

## Production

According to the author, in order to prevent mannerisms, he depicts the story from the viewpoint of the central character as much as possible. He said, "I try to keep the story as simple as possible.

As for the reason for ending the serialization, the author stated, "I felt that there was a limit to the story depicted from the perspective of a criminal, a black-money trader. The more I pushed the story, the more readers would leave. After that, he began serializing "Kujo no Daishin" (The Deadly Sins of the Nine), with a lawyer as the main character.
