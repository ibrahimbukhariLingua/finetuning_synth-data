Orano


# Orano



**Orano SA** is a French multinational nuclear fuel cycle corporation headquartered in Châtillon, Hauts-de-Seine. The company is engaged in uranium mining, conversion-enrichment, spent fuel recycling, nuclear logistics, dismantling, and nuclear cycle engineering activities. It was created in 2017 as a result of restructuring and recapitalizing of the nuclear conglomerate Areva. Orano is majority owned by the French state. As of September 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Orano is the second largest uranium producer in the world with 9% share in global uranium production.


## Etymology

The name Orano is derived from Ouranos, the Greek god, and it refers to uranium. The company's circular yellow logo refers to yellowcake uranium concentrate and to the nuclear fuel cycle.


## History

Orano dates back to 1976 when based on the production division of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), the *Compagnie générale des matières nucléaires* (COGEMA, now Orano Cycle) was created.
In 2001, COGEMA was merged with Framatome and CEA Industrie [fr] to form Areva.

In 2016, due to financial difficulties, Areva initiated a restructuring process. As part of this, it created a new fuel cycle company, dubbed as New Co or New Areva. The new company combined Areva Mines, Areva NC, Areva Projects, and Areva Business Support companies. It was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of Areva; however, Areva lost control over the company as the French government invested to recapitalize the company. On 23 January 2018 the company changed its name to Orano. In February 2018, Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries took 5% stakes in the company each.

In September 2018, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminated the license of Orano to construct the Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility, which was to be built in Bonneville County, Idaho. The project had been suspended since December 2011. At the same time Orano opened the Philippe Coste uranium conversion plant in France.


## Controversies

Orano continues to conduct business in Russia despite international sanctions and widespread criticism following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company has faced backlash for its decision to maintain its presence in the Russian market, as critics argue that such operations indirectly support the Russian economy.

Orano faced controversies related to its uranium mining operations in Niger, including environmental issues and the impact on local communities. Geopolitical tensions have also raised concerns about the security and control of uranium resources in the region. Reports have emerged indicating that Orano is at risk of losing its Niger uranium mine to interests associated with Russia, heightening worries about the company's operations and involvement in international affairs.


## Operations

Orano is engaged in uranium mining, conversion and enrichment, spent fuel recycling, nuclear logistics, dismantling, and nuclear cycle engineering activities. Its main subsidiaries include Orano Cycle, COGEMA and Areva NC, which is active in all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle; Orano Mining, which is active in mining activities, including exploration, extraction, and processing of uranium ore, Orano Med which focuses on the development of therapies to fight cancer; Orano TN, which deals with the transport of nuclear materials; and Orano Projects, which is responsible for the fuel cycle engineering.


### Mining

As of December 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Orano is the third largest uranium producer in the world with 11% share in global uranium production. Orano operates uranium production sites in Canada, Kazakhstan, and Niger (the monopoly has been prorogated until 2040). The operations of Orano Canada include interests in the McClean Lake uranium mill, Cigar Lake mine, McArthur River mine, and Key Lake uranium mill. In Kazakhstan, Orano has a joint venture with Kazatomprom named Katco. In Niger, Orano operates two mines near in Arlit, in northern Niger, and is also developing the Imouraren project situated 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Arlit.

In Gabon, it owns the site of former Mounana uranium mine where mining activities were carried out between 1961 and 1999.


### Processing

The conversion and enrichment operations are carried out in Malvési and Tricastin sites in France.


### Transportation and storage

Nuclear material transport and storage services are provided through Orano TN subsidiary. In 2017 the NUHOMS Matrix advanced used nuclear fuel storage overpack, a high-density system for storing multiple spent fuel rods in canisters, was launched.


### Recycling

Orano provides nuclear recycling activities at the La Hague and Melox sites in France.


### Engineering

Orano provides nuclear fuel cycle engineering services through its subsidiary Orano Projects. Its engineering sites are located in Equeurdreville, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, and Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France. The subsidiary Orano Temis is involved in mechanical engineering and manufactures special equipment, relating to the nuclear fuel cycle, as well as serving external customers in the aerospace and defense sectors. In at least one case Orano has been contracted for feasibility studies.
