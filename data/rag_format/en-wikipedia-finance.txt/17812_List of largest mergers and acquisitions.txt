This lists catalogues M&A deals ($20 billion or larger in transaction value) which were confirmed, but for a number of reasons, failed to complete.

| Rank | Year | Purchaser | Purchased | Transaction value (in billions USD) | Inflation adjusted value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2020 | Astra Zeneca | Gilead Sciences | 232.0 | 273.1 | Astra Zeneca approached Gilead about a merger; however, a combination of a lack of interest from Gilead and the COVID-19 pandemic led to any further talking being dropped. The deal also floundered due to the potential to distract both companies from their own pipelines and ongoing COVID-19 vaccine efforts. |
| 2 | 2019 | Altria | Philip Morris International | 200.0 | 238.3 | The merger was called off after a chilly reaction from investors, vaping related illnesses, and Altria's increasingly scrutinized $12.8 billion investment in vaping leader Juul. |
| 3 | 2015 | Pfizer | Allergan, plc | 160.0 | 205.7 | The deal fell through over changes made to tax inversion legislation by the Government of the United States. |
| 4 | 2008 | BHP Billiton | Rio Tinto | 148.0 | 209.4 | As commodity prices fell in value, the deal became too risky for BHP Billiton to complete. |
| 5 | 2017 | Kraft Heinz | Unilever | 143.0 | 177.8 | Kraft's offer was an 18% premium to Unilever's closing share price the day before the announcement, however Unilever Executives claimed the deal undervalued the company, as well as job-cut implications and regulator approval issues. The bid was formally dropped on February 19, citing the complexities of acquiring control in a Dutch entity without the support of shareholders. |
| 6 | 2023 | Cigna | Humana | 140.0 | 140 | The deal talks ended due to the parties not being able to agree on price. Also governmental antitrust action was a concern. |
| 7 | 1999 | MCI WorldCom | Sprint | 129.0 | 235.9 | The US Department of Justice and European Commission prohibited the merger on competition grounds, with the DoJ filing a lawsuit against the transaction. |
| 8 | 2014 | Pfizer | Astra Zeneca | 123.0 | 158.3 | Significant concerns were raised by the Government of the United Kingdom over job security, in the end leading to a deal being abandoned due to resistance from the AstraZeneca Board. |
| 9 | 2018 | Broadcom | Qualcomm | 121.0 | 146.8 | Qualcomm claimed that Broadcom had undervalued the business but did propose to meet Broadcom officials, with the initial offer of $121 billion ($140 billion with debt). On February 21, Broadcom reduced their offer to $117 billion in light of Qualcomms increased bid for NXP Semiconductors. |
| 10 | 2018 | Broadcom | Qualcomm | 117.0 | 142 | On February 21, Broadcom reduced their offer to $117 billion in light of Qualcomms increased bid for NXP Semiconductors. The deal was effectively blocked after US President Donald Trump blocked any deal based upon national security grounds. |
| 11 | 2009 | BHP Billiton (West Australian Iron Ore Assets) | Rio Tinto (West Australian Iron Ore Assets) | 116.0 | 164.7 | Mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton abandoned a controversial merger of their Australian iron ore operations after anti-competition complaints from regulators and top customers including China. |
| 12 | 1999 | MCI WorldCom | Sprint | 111.0 | 203 | The Board of Sprint claimed that the first deal undervalued the company and thus rejected the proposal. |
| 13 | 2014 | Pfizer | Astra Zeneca | 106.0 | 136.4 | AstraZeneca claimed the deal undervalued the company. |
| 14 | 2018 | Broadcom | Qualcomm | 103.0 | 125 | $130 billion with assumed debt ($103 billion without), Qualcomm shareholders would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares. Qualcomm rejected Broadcom's $103 billion takeover bid, saying the offer “dramatically” undervalued the U.S. company. |
| 15 | 2006 | Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Texas Pacific Group | The Home Depot | 100.0 | 151.1 | In a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, Home Depot said that its board "unanimously" supports the management team and its current strategy.
