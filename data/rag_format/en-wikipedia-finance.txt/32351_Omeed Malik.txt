## Career

Malik started as a spokesperson for Representative Donald M. Payne. He worked as a corporate lawyer at Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York before joining MF Global and later Bank of America Merrill Lynch to run the prime brokerage business and to lead the emerging manager program. Malik left Bank of America in January 2018 to launch an advisory firm for hedge funds and alternative investment managers. Later reports indicated that Malik was forced out after investigations into allegations of inappropriate conduct, which Malik disputed and filed a $100 million arbitration claim against Bank of America on the basis of defamation, retaliation, breach of contract, and discrimination against his Muslim background. In July 2018, Bank of America settled the case and paid Malik an eight-figure sum.

In 2018, Malik has appeared on Showtime's TV series *Billions* in a cameo role.

In 2020, Neil Patel brought in Malik as a new partner of right-wing news site *The Daily Caller*.

In 2022, Malik founded 1789 Capital, a venture capital firm which focuses on products and companies associated with conservative values. In 2023, it made its first investment into the new media company lead by Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel.

In 2023, Malik's Colombier Acquisition Corp agreed to merge with online marketplace Public Square.

Malik was an early supporter of the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 2024 presidential campaign, and later a supporter of the Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign. Following Trump's conviction in New York, Malik said: "This verdict will have less than zero impact on my support". Following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. announced that he would be joining Malik's 1789 Capital rather than a role in his father's administration.
