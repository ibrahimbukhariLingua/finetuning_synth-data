German Regional Airlines


# German Regional Airlines



**German Regional Airlines GmbH & Co. KG**, operating under the **German Airways** brand and formerly named *WDL Aviation*, is a German charter and wet lease aircraft operator, headquartered at Cologne Bonn Airport, and part of the Zeitfracht Group.


## History

Initially named *WDL Flugdienst*, the company was set up in 1974 as a subsidiary of *Westdeutsche Luftwerbung GmbH*, an aerial advertising provider founded in 1955.

The current name was adopted in 1991, when the parent was reorganized as *WDL Group*. With WDL Aviation offering aircraft lease and charter services, the aerial advertising and sightseeing flight branch (using blimps) survives in the other subsidiary of WDL Group, which is called *WDL Luftschiff*. Since 1998, the British Aerospace 146 is in service with WDL Aviation. Other aircraft types that were operated by WDL Aviation include the Fokker F27 Friendship and an Airbus A320-200 on lease from Adria Airways between 1992 and 1993.

WDL Aviation was acquired by the Berlin logistics company *Zeitfracht* on 1 October 2017. During 2018, WDL Aviation started acquiring BAe 146-300 QT freighter aircraft while planning to replace its BAe 146 passenger aircraft with newer Embraer 190s and received its new brand name *German Airways* thereafter.

In March 2020, Zeitfracht announced a rebranding for WDL Aviation which is to become German Regional Airlines operating within the *German Airways* branding alongside sister company Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter which became the actual, and now defunct, *German Airways*.
