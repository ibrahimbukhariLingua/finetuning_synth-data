Mining Association of the United Kingdom


# Mining Association of the United Kingdom



**The Mining Association of the United Kingdom** is a trade association for all kinds of mining undertaken by UK companies.


## Function

It promotes and fosters the interests of the metals and mining industry in any part of the world and the corporations, companies, firms and persons engaged or interested in the industry or in industries ancillary to or allied with the metals and minerals industry.

Its members include all the major industrial mineral mining operators in the United Kingdom. Its work is concentrated on representing its member's interest at Government and European level on environmental and health & safety issues. It is actively involved in lobbying and consulting on proposed legislation.

It is an active member of Euromines (the European Mining Federation) and values the access and links to European Commission legislative procedures, which this brings. The majority of new legislation which has impact on the mining sector originates in Brussels. Therefore, the Association is committed to participating in Europe.

It represents the commercial interest of the UK's mining industry outside of coal mining, and includes industries mining:

* Potash (potassium carbonate)
* Salt
* Sylvinite - a mixture of sylvite (potassium chloride) and halite (commonly known as rock salt - sodium chloride)
* Gypsum (calcium sulphate) - used for plaster
* Fluorspar - also known as fluorite (calcium fluoride)
* Barytes (barium sulphate)
