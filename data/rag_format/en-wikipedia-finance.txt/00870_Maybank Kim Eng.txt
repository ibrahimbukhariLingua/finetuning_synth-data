## History

**Pre Merger with Maybank: 1972–2011**

Maybank Kim Eng Group started in 1972 with the founding of Kim Eng Securities Ptd Ltd in Singapore. Its operations expanded over the years, with 1988 and 1989 marking its expansion into Hong Kong and London respectively. A year later, Kim Eng expanded into Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States of America, and entrenched its position in Singapore by listing on the Singapore Exchange thereby becoming the first stock broker in the country to do so. In 1993, Kim Eng started operating in the Philippines and in 1998, opened in Thailand as a fully licensed securities company. Kim Eng's Thailand operations eventually listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in 2003. Expansion continued in 2007 as the company entered Vietnam. The 2000s featured several mergers and acquisitions including the acquiring on Yuanta Thailand in 2001 and the merger with fellow brokerage Ong Asia Limited the following year. A Joint Venture with Heritage Trust Group was also entered into in 2002 and a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFG Securities was formed in 2008.

Maybank Investment Bank was incorporated in Malaysia under the name Asian and Euro-American Merchant Bankers Berhad in 1973, although its name was subsequently changed to Aseambankers Malaysia Berhad four years later in 1977. Eventually, in 2003, Aseambankers merged with Mayban Discount Berhad and Mayban Securities Sdn Bhd, and Aseambankers acquired BinaFikir Sdn Bhd in 2008. Eventually, Aseambankers changed its name to become Maybank Investment Bank Berhad in 2009.

**Maybank Kim Eng Years: 2011–Present**

In 2011, Maybank Berhad, via Maybank Investment Bank Holdings Sdn Bhd, acquired Kim Eng Holdings. Conditional Share Purchase Agreements (CSPAs) for Maybank IB Holdings’ acquisition of 44.6% in Kim Eng Holdings were executed and announced in January 2011. Later that year in August, Kim Eng Holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of Maybank and delisted from the Singapore Exchange, bringing its stock broking and investment banking operations in the region to Maybank. The new brand name, Maybank Kim Eng, was unveiled in November.
