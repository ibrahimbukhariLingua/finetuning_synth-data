Cargomatic


# Cargomatic



**Cargomatic** is a logistics company founded in 2013 by Brett Parker & Jonathan Kessler, based in Long Beach, California specifically targeting the fragmented short-haul and drayage trucking markets connecting shippers and carriers real-time with its crowdshipping web platform and mobile app.


## Focus

The company focuses on assisting shippers and carriers in the trucking industry through the following segments:

* Capacity utilization – Maximizing carrier truck capacity to reduce empty runs.
* Gig economy – Allowing truckers to do additional jobs, or owner operators to be their own bosses.
* Drayage – Minimizing wait times to relieve congestion at ports such as the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach.
* Less than truckload shipping – Assisting shippers without fleets, or shipper fleets that are at or over capacity by adding supplemental drivers.


## Funding

In 2016, at the close of Series A funding, Cargomatic raised a total of $20.8M from investors including Morado Ventures, Canaan Partners, Sherpa Capital, and SV Angel. In 2018, Cargomatic raised $35M in its Series B funding from Warburg Pincus, Canaan Partners and Genesee & Wyoming.
