## History

* 1997, Belgacom created its International carrier Services business unit. Later, in the early years 2000, the Belgacom Group deliberately separated the financial reporting of its International Carrier Services to increase financial transparency and accountability.

Post implementation of the transaction, BICS’ shares distribution becomes the following: Belgacom own 57.6% of BICS, Swisscom 22.4% and MTN 20.0%.
