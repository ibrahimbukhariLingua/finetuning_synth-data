Innoscience


# Innoscience



**InnoScience (Suzhou) Technology Holding Co., Ltd.** (**Innoscience**; Chinese: 英诺赛科; pinyin: *Yīngnuò Sàikē*) is a publicly listed Chinese semiconductor company headquartered in Suzhou, Jiangsu.

It is the world's largest integrated device manufacturer that is fully focused on Gallium nitride (GaN) technology.


## Background

Innoscience was founded in 2015 originally in Zhuhai by Luo Weiwei. Luo received her PhD in applied mathematics from Massey University and previously worked as a scientist for NASA for 15 years.

Innoscience became a leading player in the latest generation of microchips made using technology that combines GaN with traditional silicon. Due to heavy R&D spending to boost its production of GaN chips, GaN wafers and GaN modules, Innoscience has so far been unprofitable. The vast majority of its sales are to customers in China.

In early 2022, Innoscience announced it was launching international operations in the US and Europe.

On 30 December 2024, Innoscience held its initial public offering (IPO) becoming a listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The offering raised HK$1.4 billion giving it a valuation of HK$27 billion.


## Lawsuits

In July 2023, Innoscience was investigated by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), after an intellectual property complaint was filed by Efficient Power Conversion (EPC). In November 2024, USITC ruled Innoscience infringed upon a patent of EPC. USITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting importation of certain Innoscience chips that violated EPC's patent which barred Innoscience from entering the US market. Innoscience stated it will appeal the ruling.

On 14 March 2024, Infineon Technologies (Infineon) initiated a patent infringement suit against Innoscience in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On 4 June 2024, Infineon filed additional lawsuits against Innoscience's German distributors in the District Court of Munich. On 23 July 2024, Infineon expanded its lawsuit scope in California to include affiliates of Infineon. In January 2025, Innoscience countersued Infineon and its Chinese subsidiaries in the Suzhou Intermediate people's court of Jiangsu Province over alleged infringement of two patents on power chips.

According to supply chain sources, Innoscience offers price quotes that are only about half of what other global GaN companies charge, which lead to EPC and Infineon taking proactive measures to prevent a price war coming out of China. InnoScience's low-price strategy would affect two larger groups which are the GaN supply chain companies outside China and domestic competitors within China. Companies would be unable to compete with Innoscience on price and the non-China supply chain could collapse if GaN OEM partners pulled out due to cost.
