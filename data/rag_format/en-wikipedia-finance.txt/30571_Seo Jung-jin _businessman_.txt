## Biography

He was born in Cheongju, South Korea on October 23, 1957. He graduated from Jemulpo High School [ko]. He received Bachelor of Industrial Engineering and Master of Business Administration degrees from Konkuk University.

He began his career at Samsung Electronics. He then worked as a consultant for Daewoo Motors.

## Personal life

Seo has two sons. His first son, Seo Jin-seok (서진석), is chairman of the board at Celltrion and Celltrion Pharm. His second son, Seo Jun-suk (서준석), is Celltrion Healthcare's chairman of the board. Their 2024 appointments to leadership positions in the company reportedly appeared to contradict a previous statement that he had made in 2019, where he claimed his intent was to have non-family members lead the company.

Seo was in a common-law relationship with a woman from 2001 to 2012. By 2023, she was reportedly CEO of Seorin Holdings and Seowon D&D, affiliates of Celltrion. He had two daughters with this woman, although their relationship became strained and they fell out of contact. He paid child support to this woman; he alleged that she demanded more money from him, and that he filed a police report against her. In 2021, his family register was updated to include these two daughters.
