Wilmorite Properties


# Wilmorite Properties



**Wilmorite Properties, Inc** is a commercial real estate company based in Chili, New York, a suburb of Rochester, New York.

A subsidiary of the company owes significant back taxes and fees to the City of Rochester resulting from a loan and tax agreement surrounding the failed development of the Sibley Building.

The company manages Eastview Mall, The Mall at Greece Ridge, The Marketplace Mall, and Pittsford Plaza, all of which are in Rochester.


## History

James P. Wilmot founded the company in the 1940s and since then, Wilmorite has developed retail, office, hotel, and residential real estate.

In 1967, Wilmorite built Greece Towne Mall (now The Mall at Greece Ridge), one of the first enclosed regional malls in New York State. In 1969, Wilmorite opened Long Ridge Mall and combined Greece Towne Mall and Long Ridge Mall in 1994, renaming it The Mall at Greece Ridge Center, dropping "Center" in 2006.

In 2005, the majority of the assets of the company were acquired by Macerich.
