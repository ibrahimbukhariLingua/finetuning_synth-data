## Active learning

Quantic uses an "interactive mobile app" developed by its parent company Pedago. It uses "active learning" methodologies through interactive and gamified learning modules as alternative to video lectures. Successive modules are unlocked after completing tasks such as quizzes from its prerequisite courses. Students are graded numerically and require a passing rate of at least 80% to complete a course. It also has machine-based tutoring that helps provide individualized feedback to students.


## Accreditation

Quantic received institutional accreditation from the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) in 2020. Quantic School of Business and Technology and its Valar Institute Division are licensed by the District of Columbia Higher Education Licensure Commission in Washington, DC and accredited by the DEAC. The DEAC is listed by the United States Department of Education as a recognized accrediting agency and is also recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).
