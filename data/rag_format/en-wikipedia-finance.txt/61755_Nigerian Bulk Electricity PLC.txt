## Background

Nigerian's deficient power sector supply has been a challenge that the past three presidential administrations have steadfastly sought to address. In 2001, the federal Government, in a bid to address the deficiency in power sector supply, adopted the National Electric power policy for the reform of the sector. Following suit, the **Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA)**, was passed into law in March 2005. A key thrust of the sector from public to private sector. In furtherance of this goal, the Act saw the creation of the **Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN)** which assumed the assets, Liabilities and employees of the erstwhile **Nigeria Electricity Power Authority (NEPA)**; the subsequent unbundling of PHCN into 18 successor companies, the establishment of the Rural **Electrification Agency (REA)** and the provision for the establishment of two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to undertake electric power trading and management of extant liabilities respectively
