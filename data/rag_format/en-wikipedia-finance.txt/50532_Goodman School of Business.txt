### Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario (CPA Ontario)

The Goodman School of Business received accreditation by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario in November 2013.

Goodman offers graduates of the CPA-Accredited Program with direct access to the CPA Common Final Evaluation (CFE), which is the national qualifying evaluation for the CPA designation. The accreditation was given for the proposed CPA pathways, delivered through a combination of the Bachelor of Accounting (BAcc) and Master of Accountancy (MAcc) degree programs, based on its substantial equivalence to the new CPA Professional Education Program (CPA PEP).

The Master of Business Administration (MBA) at the Goodman School of Business was accredited by the Chartered Professional Accountants of Ontario under the new National CPA Accreditation Program in March 2014. Goodman is currently the only business school in Ontario to offer a combined MBA and CPA program. The new accredited stream allows non-accounting university graduates to pursue an MBA and an accounting designation at the same time. The two-year graduate program also includes an optional co-op work term. The CPA/MBA program will offer a CPA-Accredited stream that provides graduates with advanced standing in the CPA Professional Education Program (CPA PEP). The CPA/MBA pathway is available to incoming students in the traditional MBA pathway and the MBA (International Student Pathway).
