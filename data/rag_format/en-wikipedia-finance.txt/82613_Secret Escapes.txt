## History

Secret Escapes was formerly called DMC Cruise Limited until 16 Nov 2010 when it was re-branded as Secret Escapes by Tom Valentine and Alex Saint, after identifying a demand in luxury travel deals in the UK.
In 2014, the company acquired the German mobile hotel booking application Justbook to compete with other last minute hotel mobile apps.

In July 2015 the company secured an additional $60m in funding from existing investor Octopus Investments as well as Google Ventures to fund further expansion and acquired UK based mycityvenue in an all-cash-and-stock deal, adding another 1200 venues and 1.4 million members to its portfolio.
According to IBT, the company has over 19 million members and has sold 2 million room nights.

In October 2015, Secret Escapes continued its expansion in Germany by acquiring flash deal site Travista.

In 2017, Secret Escapes acquired Slevomat Group, Central and Eastern Europe's leading travel deals and experience company.
