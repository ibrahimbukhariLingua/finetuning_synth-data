Eversheds Sutherland


# Eversheds Sutherland



**Eversheds Sutherland** is a global multinational law practice created by a combination of law firms Eversheds LLP and Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP, in February 2017, and is one of the 50 largest law practices in the world.


## History

Between 2008 and 2010, Eversheds had four rounds of redundancies and cut a total of around 730 jobs, the largest staff reductions of any UK-based law firm in that period.

In May 2011, Eversheds merged with the law consortium KSLG, which comprised Dhabaan & Partners in Saudi Arabia; Khasawneh & Associates in the UAE; and Sanad Law Group in Jordan and Iraq.

In 2013, Eversheds split from its South African arm, which rebranded to its former name, Routledge Modise.
