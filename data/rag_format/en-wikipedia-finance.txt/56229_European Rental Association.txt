European Rental Association


# European Rental Association



The **ERA - European Rental Association** is a trade association representing the equipment rental sector in Europe.


## History and Mission

ERA was set up in 2006 to promote and represent the equipment rental industry, which was largely overlooked and seen as an integral part of the construction industry itself. ERA represents over 5,000 rental companies in Europe, either directly or through its 15 rental association members (14 national associations and one international).

Its work focuses on 7 main areas:

* **Promotion** of the rental concept
* **Technical** issues and equipment
* **Statistics** on the European rental market
* **Sustainability** in the rental industry
* **Harmonisation** of national regulations in Europe
* **Awareness** of the challenges of the future of the rental industry
* **Support** for rental associations

## Structure

ERA, like most trade associations, uses working committees which meet regularly throughout the year and develop deliverables that may be of use to member companies and associations.

There are currently 5 committees and 2 working groups:

• Technical Committee
• National Associations Committee
• Promotion Committee
• Statistics Committee
• Sustainability Committee

• Future Group

• Cybersecurity working group


## Members

Direct members of ERA can either be rental associations or rental companies with operations in Europe. Equipment manufacturers and other suppliers to the rental industry can become associate members.


## International Exhibitions and events

ERA is the co-organiser of the International Rental Exhibition, IRE, which takes place every 3 years and is the largest European trade show for the equipment rental business. The event raises the profile of the rental industry in Europe, standing alongside Intermat and Bauma as the two other large European construction exhibitions.
