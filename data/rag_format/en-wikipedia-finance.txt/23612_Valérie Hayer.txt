## Political career


### Member of the European Parliament

In the European Parliament, Hayer has served on the Committee on Budgets. She is also her parliamentary group's coordinator on the committee. In 2020, she served as the Parliament's co-rapporteur (alongside José Manuel Fernandes) on a successful motion to assign new tax revenues to the budget of the European Union to repay its joint borrowing of 750 billion euros ($888 billion) for economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic. She is also part of the Parliament's negotiating team for the long-term EU budget (MFF) and own resources reform.

In addition to her committee assignments, Hayer is part of the Parliament's delegation for relations with the countries of Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). She is also a member of the European Internet Forum, the European Parliament Intergroup on Artificial Intelligence and Digital, the European Parliament Intergroup on LGBT Rights and the MEPs Against Cancer group.

In October 2021, Hayer and Marie-Pierre Vedrenne were appointed as co-chairs of President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance electoral list in the European Parliament, replacing Stéphane Séjourné.

Hayer is also the president of the Association for European Revival, which is financed by LREM.


### Renew Europe leadership, 2024–present

In January 2024, Hayer was elected to succeed Séjourné as leader of Renew Europe, then the parliament’s third-largest political grouping. At 37 years, she became the youngest-ever liberal parliamentary leader as well as the first female one since Simone Veil. On February 29, 2024, Hayer confirmed being named head of the “Need for Europe” list of the presidential majority for the 2024 European elections.

In the June 2024 European Parliament election, Hayer led the Ensemble (political coalition) formed by Emmanuel Macron as part of Renaissance (French political party) to a second-place finish, with 14.86% of the French national votes.


## Political positions


### Foreign policy

In March 2024, Hayer criticized Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orban for their relationships with Russian president Vladimir Putin, accusing them of appeasement. During the 2024 State visits by Xi Jinping to France, Serbia and Hungary, she stated that the persecution of Uyghurs in China could be considered genocide and that Europe had been "too naive" in its relations with China.
