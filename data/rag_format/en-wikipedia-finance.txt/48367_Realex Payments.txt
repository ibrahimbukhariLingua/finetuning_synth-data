## History

Realex Payments was founded in 2000 by entrepreneur, Colm Lyon. The company grew rapidly, employing over 170 staff by 2015.

In 2012, the company opened a new Dublin Headquarters on Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin which was officially opened by the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny.

Lyon was Chairman of the Irish Internet Association from 2004 until December 2007. In 2005, he was a finalist of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. In 2009, he was named Internet Hero at the Eircom Golden Spiders awards for his work in setting up Realex Payments. In 2010, Lyon was involved in initiating iGap hosted by Enterprise Ireland.

In August 2013, a personal payment account for consumers called Realex Fire was launched as part of Realex Financial Services Limited. Following the acquisition of Realex Payments in March 2015, Realex Financial Services Limited was renamed Fire Financial Services Limited and its product rebranded as Pay with Fire.
