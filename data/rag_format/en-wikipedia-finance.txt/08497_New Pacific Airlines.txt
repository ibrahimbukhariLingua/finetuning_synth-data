New Pacific Airlines


# New Pacific Airlines



**New Pacific Airlines**, formerly known as **Corvus Airlines** and **Northern Pacific Airways**, is an American charter airline and former low-cost carrier based in Anchorage, Alaska.


## History

The airline also operates inside Alaska under the brand and is the same company as Ravn Alaska. Ravn Connect is a separate company but also a subsidiary of FLOAT Alaska. The airline plans to operate transpacific flights between North America and Asia, with a stopover at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. The airline's business model has been compared to that of Icelandair, allowing passengers to either quickly connect to their next flight, or to have a longer multi-day stopover at Anchorage to allow passengers to sightsee in Alaska.

In October 2022, BNSF filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the airline for using the Northern Pacific name, which was also the name of the Northern Pacific Railroad that stretched from Minnesota to the Pacific Northwest and was subsequently merged with BNSF's predecessor, Burlington Northern Railroad.

The airline received its full FAA authorization to launch flights on July 9, 2023, allowing the airline to launch commercial flights with passengers aboard. Operations commenced on July 14, 2023, with their inaugural flight from Ontario International Airport in Ontario, California, to Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.

On August 28, 2023, the airline was issued a preliminary injunction regarding the trademark infringement case from BNSF, ordering the airline to cease use of the Northern Pacific name. While there was an opportunity to appeal the decision, it decided not to and instead opted to rebrand as New Pacific Airlines, after a call for employees to provide suggestions for a new name. The new name was chosen in order to avoid changing existing branding assets, such as the "N" logo which had been affixed on every seat on board the airline's aircraft and the airline's website domain. While the airline began to use the new name, it had not yet received regulatory approval for the change, which meant that tickets sold still displayed the old Northern Pacific name.

In April 2024, New Pacific Airlines announced it would end all remaining scheduled flights and focus on charter operations entirely.


## Destinations

New Pacific Airlines started operations flying between Las Vegas and Ontario due to the ongoing closure of Russian airspace and delays in certification from Korean and Japanese authorities. The airline originally also announced plans to fly to destinations such as Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, New York City and Orlando from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.
