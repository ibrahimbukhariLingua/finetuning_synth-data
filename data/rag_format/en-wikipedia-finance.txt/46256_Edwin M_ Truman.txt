Truman is a supporter of the IMF. He has proposed a special, on-time allocation of $250bn in SDRs by donor member countries as a way of dramatically building confidence in co-operative solutions to the global recession and to persuade countries not to manage their exchange rates in order to build up foreign exchange surpluses. He urged the G-20 'to commit to substantial and sustained actions for a period that matches the likely duration of the crisis'. Truman urged that IMF should enforce the coordinated plan, that it should keep a real-time, public scorecard identifying countries which are not doing their part.


## Advocacy

Truman has led international advocacy efforts to defend Andreas Georgiou, the former head of the Hellenic Statistical Authority who has been the target of multiple prosecutions and lawsuits.
