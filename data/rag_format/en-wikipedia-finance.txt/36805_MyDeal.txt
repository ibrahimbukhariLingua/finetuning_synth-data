# MyDeal



**MyDeal** is an e-commerce platform operating as an online marketplace.


## History

Sean Senvirtne, an Australian entrepreneur, founded MyDeal and also currently serving as its CEO. Between 2007 and 2011, while working on advertising packages, Senvirtne conceptualized the idea for MyDeal, leading to its establishment.

In 2021, MyDeal expanded its executive team by appointing Ryan Gracie as its first Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Prior to joining MyDeal, Gracie was part of Catch.com.au. This appointment preceded MyDeal's comprehensive rebranding initiative.

In September 2022, it was acquired by Woolworths Group, a major retail company in Australia.

In October 2022, MyDeal experienced a significant data breach, where personal information of approximately 2.2 million customers was exposed. The breach included names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Woolworths Group promptly responded, apologizing for the incident and taking immediate steps to secure the compromised data and prevent future breaches.
