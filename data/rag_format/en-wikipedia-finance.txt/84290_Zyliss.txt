**Zyliss** is a Swiss manufacturer of kitchen utensils. Originally a private company, Zyliss is now a brand owned by DKSH, a Swiss holding company.


## History

Zyliss was founded by trained bicycle mechanic, Karl Zysset (1907â€”1998) in 1951. The names *Zyliss* is based on a combination of the founder's surname and the town of Lyss, Switzerland where the first factory was established.

The company launched its first product, the onion chopper, with the slogan "Zig-Zig Zyliss".


## Timeline

In 1982, the company was sold to two investors who in turn sold the operation in 1985 to the Diethelm Keller Holding Group, now DKSH.

In 2001, Zyliss partnered with the design firm, IDEO to develop a series of kitchen products that have gone on to see worldwide success.

In 2003, the company reduced its number of employees from 105 to 80 and the company's management announced that the production site of Zyliss would be relocated. After a protest in Switzerland the move was cancelled. Thirty staff of the fifty in the Swiss team moved to China during the mid-2000s. The headquarters were also moved to Zurich in December 2005.

In 2008, Zyliss partnered with global design firm, RKS Design, to develop a new brand language including the Red Dot-winning salad spinner.

In 2006, the company, Zyliss AG, was delisted and was consolidated into DKSH. Today, Zyliss is operated by DKB Household Switzerland AG, the household utensil subsidiary of DKSH. This subsidiary currently has 120 employees and in addition to Zyliss they also operate the brand Cole & Mason (salt & pepper grinders and herb and spice tools) and the appliance brands Koenig and Turmix.


## Inventions

Three notable inventions have been developed by Zyliss including the "Susi" garlic press, the salad spinner, and an onion chopper. The Susi garlic press has an accompanying tool cleaner, and has been produced since the mid-20th century. The company also began creating the Zyliss vise (a home improvement tool) in the 1970s and has sold a slicing mandoline. The company has worked with IDEO on projects including the salad spinner, specifically on the aesthetic and visual components.
