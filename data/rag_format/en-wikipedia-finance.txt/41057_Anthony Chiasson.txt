# Anthony Chiasson



**Anthony R. Chiasson** (born August 27, 1973) is an American hedge fund manager and co-founder of Level Global Investors LP, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund management firm. Level Global was launched in 2003 with about $500 million in assets under management, and grew to $4.2 billion in assets and 75 employees before closing in early 2011.

Chiasson was convicted of insider trading in December 2012, but the conviction was subsequently overturned in a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on December 10, 2014. The Supreme Court of the United States denied the Justice Department's request to review the case on October 5, 2015. The appeal court ruling and the dismissal of the indictment against Chiasson stand.

Chiasson also funded a Presidential Scholarship at Babson which was geared towards supporting need-based students from the State of Maine who are committed to pursuing a career in business.


## Controversy

In early 2012, federal prosecutors from the U.S Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York alleged that Anthony Chiasson, Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management LLC and others, made illegal stock trades based on corporate secrets about Dell Inc. and Nvidia Corporation. Chiasson was found guilty of conspiracy and multiple counts of securities fraud on December 17, 2012.

Chiasson and Newman appealed their convictions to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, located in Manhattan, which heard oral arguments on April 22, 2014. On December 10, 2014, the three-judge panel unanimously overturned the convictions of Chiasson and his co-defendant Todd Newman, finding that the government failed to prove they engaged in insider trading. The Appeals Court said the Government presented no evidence that he engaged in insider trading and that the judge misread the law. On April 16, 2015, the judge dismissed the indictment, and Chiasson was exonerated. This was the first time an appeals court has overturned convictions in connection with the Justice Department's crackdown on insider trading. The priority the department placed on insider trading has been met with criticism by some editorial boards and commentators. U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, characterized the legal rationale supporting Chiasson's unanimous acquittal as "dramatically wrong" and filed a request for reconsideration by the three-judge panel that heard the appeal or for a rehearing *en banc*. Both requests were denied without comment on April 3, 2015. On April 16, 2015, the judge dismissed the indictments, and both Chiasson and Newman were exonerated. The Supreme Court of the United States denied the Justice Department's request to review the case on October 5, 2015. The appeal court ruling and the dismissal of the indictment against Chiasson stand.
