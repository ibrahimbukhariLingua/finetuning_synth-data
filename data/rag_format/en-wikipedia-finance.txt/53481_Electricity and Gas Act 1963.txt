Electricity and Gas Act 1963


# Electricity and Gas Act 1963



The **Electricity and Gas Act 1963** (c. 59) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which increased the amounts that could be borrowed by the Electricity Council, the electricity boards, the Gas Council, and the area gas boards. It enabled monetary advances to be made to these bodies, and provided for members of the bodies to be recompensed.


## Background

Reports on the gas industry in 1960 and the electricity industry in 1963 had been published by the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries. Both reports provided insights into the progress and problems of the industries. They identified that future expenditure was likely to be greater than budgeted by earlier legislation. The 1963 Act aimed to address this by increasing the borrowing powers of the Electricity Council and boards in England and Wales, for the Scottish electricity boards, and for the Gas Council and its boards. It raised the amounts to a limit likely to be reached in about three years which would provide an opportunity for Parliament to review the progress of each industry at approximately three-year intervals.

The Act permitted the Minister of Power to make Treasury advances to the Gas and Electricity Councils and to the Scottish boards. It also enabled compensation to be provided to a council or board member who leaves before their term of office had expired.
