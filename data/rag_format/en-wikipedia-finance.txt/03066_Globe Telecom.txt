## History

On December 8, 1928, the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. 3495 granting the Robert Dollar Company (a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of California), a franchise to operate wireless long-distance message services in the Philippines. Subsequently, the Legislature passed Act No. 4150 on November 28, 1934, to transfer the franchise and privileges of the Robert Dollar Company to **Globe Wireless Limited**, which was incorporated in the Philippines on January 15, 1935.

In 1965, Globe Wireless Limited was merged with Mackay Radio & Telegraph Company and Philippine Press Wireless to form **Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corporation** ("Globe-Mackay"), with the transfer of Mackay's franchise to Globe Wireless Limited approved by the Congress through Republic Act No. 4491 enacted on June 19, 1965. By Republic Act No. 4630 enacted in the same date by the Congress, its franchise was further expanded to allow Globe-Mackay to operate international communications systems. Globe-Mackay was granted a new franchise on December 24, 1980, by Batasang Pambansa, under Batas Pambansa Blg. 95, extending it for 50 years.

In 1974, Ayala Corporation began its investing in Globe-Mackay. Globe-Mackay offered its shares to the public on August 11, 1975, becoming the first telecommunications company in the country to do so.

In 1991, Globe-Mackay merged with Clavecilla Radio Corporation, a domestic telecommunications pioneer, to form **GMCR, Inc.** The merger gave GMCR the capability to provide all forms of telecommunications to address the international and domestic requirements of its customers. The merger was also approved by the Congress through Republic Act No. 7229 enacted on March 19, 1992, which amended its franchise.

On August 20, 1998, GMCR was renamed as **Globe Telecom, Inc.**

In 1993, Globe partnered with Singapore Telecom, Inc. (STI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Limited ("Singtel"), after Ayala and STI signed a memorandum of understanding.

In 2001, Globe merged with Isla Communications Company, Inc. ("Islacom"), a joint venture with Deutsche Telekom as foreign partner. It became its wholly owned subsidiary effective on June 27, 2001. Deutsche Telekom eventually sold its share to Singapore Telecom.

In 2003, the National Telecommunications Commission ("NTC") granted Globe Telecom's application to transfer its fixed line business assets and subscribers to Islacom, pursuant to its strategy to integrate all of its fixed line services under Islacom. Subsequently, Islacom was renamed as Innove Communications, Inc.

In 2004, Globe invested in G-Xchange, Inc. ("GXI"), a wholly owned subsidiary, to handle the mobile payment and remittance service marketed under the GCash brand using Globe Telecom's network as transport channel. GXI started commercial operations on October 16, 2004. In late 2019, the GCash brand was refreshed by global branding and design agency Serious Studio. That brand refresh was suggested by Ant Financial, Globe's venture partner in GCash (by way of Mynt, GXI's successor company).

In November 2004, Globe and seven other leading Asia-Pacific mobile operators ("JV Partners") signed an agreement ("JV agreement") to form Bridge Alliance. The joint venture company operates through a Singapore-incorporated company, Bridge Mobile Pte. Limited (BMPL) which serves as a commercial vehicle for the JV partners to build and establish a regional mobile infrastructure and common service platform to deliver different regional mobile services to their subscribers. The Bridge Alliance has a combined customer base of over 900 million subscribers among its partners in Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas.

In 2005, Innove was awarded by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) with a nationwide franchise for its fixed line business, allowing it to operate a Local Exchange Carrier service nationwide and expand its network coverage. In December 2005, the NTC approved Globe Telecom's application for third generation (3G) radio frequency spectra to support the upgrade of its cellular mobile telephone system ("CMTS") network to be able to provide 3G services. Globe was assigned with 10-Megahertz (MHz) of the 3G radio frequency spectrum.

On May 19, 2008, following the approval of the NTC, the subscribers contracts of Touch Mobile (TM) prepaid service were transferred from Innove to Globe, which now operates all wireless prepaid services using its integrated cellular networks.

In August 2008, and to further grow its mobile data segment, Globe acquired 100% ownership of Entertainment Gateway Group ("EGG"), a leading mobile content provide in the Philippines. EGG Group is engaged in the development and creation of wireless products and services accessible through telephones or other forms of communication devices. It also provides internet and mobile value added services, information technology and technical services including software development and related services. EGGC is registered with the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) as a content provider. On May 15, 2014, EGGC changed its corporate name from Entertainment Gateway Group Corp. to Yondu, Inc. (Yondu).

On October 30, 2008, Globe, the Bank of the Philippine Islands and Ayala Corporation signed a memorandum of agreement to form a joint venture that would allow rural and low-income customers' access to financial products and services. In October 2009, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) approved the sale and transfer by BPI of its shares of stock in Pilipinas Savings Bank, Inc. (PSBI), formalizing the creation of the venture. Globe Telecom's and BPI's ownership stakes in PSBI is at 40% each, while AC's shareholding is at 20%. The partners plan to transform PSBI (now called BPI Globe BanKO, Inc.) into the country's first mobile microfinance bank. The bank's initial focus will be on wholesale lending to other microfinance institutions but will eventually expand to include retail lending, deposit-taking, and micro-insurance. BPI Globe BanKO opened its first branch in Metro Manila in the first quarter of 2011 and now has 6 branches nationwide, over 2,000 partner outlets, 261,000 customers and over P2.4 billion in its wholesale loan portfolio.

On November 25, 2008, Globe formed GTI Business Holdings, Inc. (GTIBH) primarily to act as an investment company. In March 2012, Globe launched Kickstart Ventures, Inc. (Kickstart) to help, support and develop the dynamic and growing community of technopreneurs in the Philippines. Kickstart is a business incubator that is focused on providing aspiring technopreneurs with the efficient environment and the necessary mechanisms to start their own business. Since its launch, Kickstart has 10 companies in its portfolio covering the digital media and technology, and web/mobile platform space.

In May 2013, ABS-CBN Convergence, Inc. ("ABS-C", formerly Multimedia Telephony, Inc.) announced the launch of its mobile brand, ABS-CBNmobile. The launch of the new mobile brand is being supported through a network sharing agreement with Globe, wherein the latter provides network capacity and coverage to ABS-C on a nationwide basis. ABS-C formally launched the brand on November 26, 2013.

In October 2013, following the court's approval of the Amended Rehabilitation Plan (jointly filed by Globe and BayanTel in May 2013), Globe acquired a 38% interest in BayanTel by converting BayanTel's unsustainable debt into common shares. This follows Globe Telecom's successful tender offer for close to 97% of BayanTel's outstanding indebtedness as of December 2012. As part of the amended rehab plan and pending regulatory approvals, Globe would further convert a portion of its sustainable debt into common shares of BayanTel, bringing up its stake to around 56%. In October 2014, Globe Telecom received a copy of the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by the Court of Appeals stopping the National Telecommunications Commission's (NTC) proceedings in connection with the bid of Globe Telecom Inc. to take over Bayan Telecommunications Inc. (BayanTel). Despite the lapse of the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) last December 9, 2014, the Court of Appeals has advised the NTC to refrain from conducting any proceedings in connection with the bid of Globe assume majority control of BayanTel.

On June 3, 2014, Globe signed an agreement with Azalea Technology, Inc. and SCS Computer Systems, acquiring the entire ownership stake in Asticom. Asticom, a systems integrator and information technology services provider to domestic and international markets, is 49% owned by Azalea, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Ayala Corporation and 51% owned by SCS Computer Systems, a subsidiary of Singapore Telecom.

On June 30, 2015, Globe incorporated Global Capital Venture Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the Philippines and formed for the purpose of venturing into strategic non-core business.

In 2018, Globe Telecom was selected as the best workplace in Asia. and the Internet was proposed to be extended in Europe.

On December 14, 2018, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11151 which renewed Innove's legislative franchise for another 25 years.

On October 1, 2020, Globe Telecom launched GOMO PH, the country's first fully digital telco.

In Opensignal's April report, on internet speed contest, Dito Telecommunity outplaced Smart Communications and Globe Telecom in the first quarter, with a download speed of 32 Mbps. It is also now the fastest operator for 5G, averaging 302.9 Mbps as against Smart’s 143.3 Mbps.

As of December 2022, Globe's total mobile subscriber base reached 87.9 million. It is also the country's largest telecommunications company in terms of market capitalization. However, by virtue of SIM Registration Act and due to deactivation of unregistered Globe SIM cards, the number of subscribers went down to 48.4 million as of July 26, 2023. The company now becomes second to Smart Communications in terms of subscriber base which has 50.0 million. At the end of a 5-day grace period, it again increased to 53,727,298 subscribers causing them to regain the title as the largest telecom company. Out of its total 86,746,672 subscribers or 61.94% of its total subscriber base prior, the company lost 33,019,374 SIM cards to deactivation.
