# Knight Therapeutics



**Knight Therapeutics Inc.** is a Canadian public specialty pharmaceutical company based in Montreal, Quebec that focuses on acquiring or in-licensing innovative pharmaceutical products for the Canadian and select international markets. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol GUD), with a market capitalization of $1.02 billion as of August 2019.


## History

In 1995, Jonathan Ross Goodman and Mark Beaudet founded **Paladin Labs**, the predecessor company to Knight Therapeutics. It launched an IPO in that year at $1.50 per share.

In 2011, Goodman was seriously injured in a cycling accident, forcing him to temporarily relinquish the CEO role to Mark Beaudet. The accident caused serious traumatic brain injury, although Goodman has almost fully recovered. Also in 2011, Paladin offered to buy Afexa Life Sciences for $57 million, but was outbid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. However, it succeeded in acquiring Labopharm for $20 million.

In 2014, Endo Pharmaceuticals, an American pharmaceutical company, acquired most of the assets of Paladin Labs for $3 billion, or $151 a share, a 100 times increase from its IPO price. As part of the transaction, Knight Therapeutics was spun-off to the shareholders of Paladin, with the rights to Impavido, a leishmaniasis drug. It was also led by Jonathan Ross Goodman, and was in substantially the same business.

In November 2016, it was rumored that Endo was considering selling Paladin back to Knight Therapeutics, for less than it initially paid for it.
