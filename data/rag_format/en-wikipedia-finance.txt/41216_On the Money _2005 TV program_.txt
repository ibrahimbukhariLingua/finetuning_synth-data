On the Money (2005 TV program)


# On the Money (2005 TV program)



CNBC's ***On the Money***, hosted by Carmen Wong Ulrich, is a television program that focuses primarily on personal finance, a programming departure from CNBC's "investor focused" weekday programming.

The program premiered on October 10, 2005 with Dylan Ratigan as host. Ratigan was replaced by Melissa Francis in 2007 and remained on CNBC's schedule until October 5, 2007. On September 27, it was announced that the program would be removed from the schedule effective October 10, due in part to low ratings, but the last edition was aired on October 5.

The program was completely revamped and relaunched on August 4, 2008 featuring new CNBC personality Carmen Wong Ulrich The program is now more of a financial advice show, similar to *The Suze Orman Show*.

*On the Money* was reduced from a daily 10pm program, to a single Saturday night airing (at 8pm ET) effective June 1, 2009. On August 25, 2009, CNBC announced that it would be canceling the program for the second time, shifting resources to their more successful documentary unit.

This program is not to be confused with the current program *On the Money* produced by CNBC for broadcast syndication. That program was retitled as *On the Money with Maria Bartiromo* in January 2013 from *The Wall Street Journal Report* after the end of the NBC/Dow Jones partnership deal, then cut down to the first part of the title upon Bartiromo's departure from CNBC in late November 2013 for Fox Business Network.


## About the program

In its original format, *On the Money* wrapped up the day's news from the worlds of business and everyday life, took a closer look at the money in every story. *On the Money* literally followed the money through everything from breaking news to politics, to pop culture, and even sports.

The later weekly format was more of a financial advice show, with Carmen Wong Ulrich giving financial advice to viewers through phone calls and email, as is traditional with financial talk radio programming.


## History

*On the Money*, which originally started as a nightly business news program, premiered as "Hurricane Katrina: Crisis and Recovery" (which was hosted by Bill Griffeth) on August 29, 2005, replacing reruns of *Late Night with Conan O'Brien*. Five weeks later (October 5), the program rechristened as *On the Money*. Dylan Ratigan, who previously hosted *Bullseye* (which ended its run on March 11 of that year), was given the hosting duties for the latter as well.

On July 6, 2006, *On the Money* debuted a new look, which included the program's second logo, a new set, and new graphics. The entire graphics package was designed and redesigned in house at CNBC. Gary Keenan and by Felix Thoo of Creative Group, a post production house in NYC created some promotional work for a prior version of the graphics.

Ratigan, who was the original host of this program since October 3, 2005, left the program in December 2006 in preparation for his nightly hosting duties on *Fast Money*, which redebuted as a nightly series on January 8, 2007. He was replaced on that same night by Melissa Francis. The original version of *On the Money* ended its run on October 5, 2007.

The program is now more focused on providing specific personal finance information to its audience. Viewers can call in, text, or email Carmen with their problems, and each night, Carmen will go through them individually. *On The Money* also invites a variety of "Money Experts" to join Carmen on the program and assist her in finding the solutions to her viewers' problems and concerns.
