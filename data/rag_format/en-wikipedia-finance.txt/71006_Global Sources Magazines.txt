Global Sources Magazines


# Global Sources Magazines



**Global Sources Magazines** are a series of trade magazines designed for businesses importing from China and Asia. There are 19 specialized industry-specific titles published by the business-to-business media company Global Sources (NASDAQ-GS: GSOL). All except two titles are published monthly.

Global Sources offers four core services to buyers to facilitate trade – online marketplaces, print and digital magazines, sourcing research reports, and trade shows (*China Sourcing Fairs*).


## History

The magazine series originated from the export trade magazine Asian Sources, which was first published in 1971 by Trade Media Ltd in Hong Kong. It presented facts, analyzed developments, and anticipated market trends for its readers. The magazine also featured advertisements of suppliers of Asian-made products.

As trade trends evolved, the editors decided to publish separate titles based on major trade products, starting with Asian Sources Electronics in 1974. Other industry-specific titles were introduced over the years, such as Asian Sources Timepieces, Asian Sources Electronic Components and Asian Sources Computer Products. These magazines provided international market trends and verified business contacts from China and Asia to buyers from Western markets.

The company launched the print magazines on CD-ROMs in 1996 and went online in 2008 with digital versions of the print magazines.

As the company’s customer base and span of business expanded globally, a new corporate identity was established in 1998 to reflect this. “Asian Sources” became “Global Sources” and all its publications now carry the new name.


## Content

Global Sources Magazines has 19 titles, each focusing on a major export industry.

Each issue contains reports on trade news and market trends of the focus industry. The editorial policy advocates objective reporting of export and industry trends in China and Asia.

The magazines also feature detailed profiles of the latest products, along with specifications and photos. All advertisers and featured companies are “verified suppliers” – which indicates that Global Sources has visited or called them and confirmed their business details.

Readers can contact suppliers directly through advertisements and product/advertiser indexes. Advertisements in magazines are bound by strict advertising standards, and are mostly advised & produced by an in-house creative agency, thus maintaining a level of professionalism.
