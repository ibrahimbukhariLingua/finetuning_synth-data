Skymeter


# Skymeter



**Skymeter** was a location-based services company that provided GPS data for pricing and traffic-information-applications. Skymeter was co-founded by Bern Grush, Kamal Hassan and Preet Khalsa and was headquartered at the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto, Ontario.


## Technology

Skymeter claimed to have developed a highly accurate and reliable GPS road-use meter using a liability-critical form of GPS technology they called "Financial-grade GPS" (FGPS) to provide highly reliable charging results that ensure fairness to the user and evidentiary assurance for the toll operator. This is in contrast to conventional GPS, which tends to fail in urban areas due to the urban canyon effect. The company marketed their technology for use in road pricing, parking, car sharing/renting/leasing, usage-based vehicle insurance, fleet management and emissions metering applications.
