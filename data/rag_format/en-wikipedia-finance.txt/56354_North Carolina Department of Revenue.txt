North Carolina Department of Revenue


# North Carolina Department of Revenue



The **North Carolina Department of Revenue** was created in 1921 by the North Carolina General Assembly. The department is headed by a Secretary that is appointed by the Governor. The secretary is a member of the North Carolina Cabinet. Currently, the department is responsible for administering the collection of the North Carolina state income tax, gasoline tax, sales tax, beverage tax, and inheritance tax.


## History

When the North Carolina Constitution was rewritten after the American Civil War in 1868, the North Carolina State Tax Commission was authorized to tax trades, professions, franchises, and incomes. In 1903, the State Tax Commission recommended leaving property taxes to local authorities while income, license, franchise, and inheritance taxes would remain with the state. In 1921, the General Assembly enacted a state-administered personal and corporate income tax. As part of this new tax legislation, the assembly created the Department of Revenue to administer, enforce and collect the income tax. The department was to be led by a Commissioner of Revenue, with the inaugural commissioner to be appointed by the Governor of North Carolina to a four-year term with the advice and consent of the State Senate and, beginning in 1924, the office holder was to be chosen in statewide popular elections. In 1929 the law was altered to eliminate election of the commissioner and instead have them be appointed by the governor.

At its inception, the Department of Revenue had 16 employees and worked out of the State Capitol's Senate Chamber, clerk's office and committee rooms. The department expanded over the following years and moved to different quarters as it was given new responsibilities, including management of the gasoline, licensing, and bus and truck franchise taxes and oversight of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol through a Motor Vehicle Bureau. When the financing of schools, roads, and prisons was shifted from local government to state government responsibility in the 1930s, a retail sales tax of three percent was enacted to pay for it with the Department of Revenue responsible for collecting it. The tax system under the Department of Revenue management has remained almost unchanged since then. In 1941 the General Assembly transformed the Motor Vehicle Bureau into an independent Department of Motor Vehicles, leaving the Department of Revenue with the responsibility of collecting the gasoline tax. The agency began using automated machinery to process individual income tax returns in 1960.

In 1971 the North Carolina General Assembly passed the Executive Reorganization Act. The law reformed the Department of Revenue to encompass the office of the commissioner of revenue, the Tax Research Board, and the State Board of Assessment. Two years later the title of the head of the department was changed from "commissioner" to "secretary". The General Assembly authorized the construction of a new headquarters in Raleigh for the department in 1986, and it was brought into use in 1992. The department was equipped with a computer system to host an integrated records database and collect and process taxes electronically in the 1990s; computerization was completed by 1997. In January 2011 a Local Government Division was created in the department to advise local governments' tax collection, auditing, and other processes.
