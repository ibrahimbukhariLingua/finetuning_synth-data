## Effects on the progress of 2023 vision


### 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt

On the summer of 2016, a coup d'état was attempted in Turkey against state institutions, including the government and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The attempt was carried out by a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces that organized themselves as the Peace at Home Council. They attempted to seize control of several key places in Ankara, Istanbul, and elsewhere, but failed to do so after forces loyal to the state defeated them.

During the coup, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured. Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were bombed from the air.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and 2,745 judges. A significant amount of tourists cancelled their trip to Turkey.


### 2018 Turkish currency and debt crisis

The Turkish currency was characterized by a plunging value of the Turkish lira, high inflation, rising borrowing costs and corresponding loan defaults. In 2018, the lira's exchange rate accelerated deterioration, reaching a level of US$4.5/TRY by mid-May. Among economists, the accelerating loss of value was generally attributed to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan preventing the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey from making the necessary interest rate adjustments. Erdogan, who claimed interest rates beyond his control to be "the mother and father of all evil", said that "the central bank can't take this independence and set aside the signals given by the president."


### COVID-19 pandemic

The global COVID-19 pandemic triggered severe social and economic disruption around the world, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. Governmental interventions, including travel restrictions and lockdowns, had a major effect on the economic and tourism goals.


### 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine

Turkey's economic policy has received significant setbacks as a result of the 2022 Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with gasoline price rising, canceled vacation bookings and textile purchases, and worries of food shortages. In the previous years, Turkey received the most tourists from Russia.
