Jardine Cycle & Carriage


# Jardine Cycle & Carriage



**Jardine Cycle & Carriage Limited** (SGX: C07
) is the investment holding company of Jardines in Southeast Asia. It is currently 75% held by the conglomerate.

The company was listed on the Singapore Exchange in 1969 as Cycle & Carriage Limited before it renamed to Jardine Cycle & Carriage Limited in 2004 following the integration into Jardines in 2002.


## History

It was first founded as Federal Stores in 1899 by a trader in nutmeg and sundries on Jalan Bandar (High Street) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 15 June 1899, it was renamed Cycle & Carriage by its founders, the Chua brothers, and thereafter, it expanded to sell bicycles, motorcycles, and eventually motor cars. In 1904, Cycle & Carriage shifted to the corner of High Street, Market Street and Market Square (3°8′49″N 101°41′47″E﻿ / ﻿3.14694°N 101.69639°E﻿ / 3.14694; 101.69639) and subsequently expanded to Ipoh, Penang and Singapore.

During World War I, Cycle & Carriage suffered economically as a result of the shortage of supply for cars. The war, however, encouraged the development of automobile technology, stimulating interest in the motor car, and spurring demand for Cycle & Carriage's products in 1918. In that year, Cycle & Carriage was registered in the Federated Malay States with $250,000 in registered capital. In 1926, Cycle & Carriage shifted its headquarters to Orchard Road in Singapore, with capital of SG$5 million and registered as a public company known as The Cycle & Carriage Company (1926) Limited.

World War II caused the company to cease operations, and its workshops, motor cars and trucks were absorbed by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Malaya and the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Following that in 1951, Cycle & Carriage was awarded the Mercedes-Benz franchise in Singapore, the first to carry the marque in Southeast Asia.

Cycle & Carriage launched plans to build an assembly plant in Hillview, Singapore. On 4 March 1965, the Minister for Finance (Singapore) Goh Keng Swee laid the foundation stone for the $2.5 million plant, and predicted that it would create 10,000 new jobs over the following five years. In 1969, the company launched an initial public offering, which was oversubscribed by 73 times, with a total offering of $242 million - which amounted to just a little short of the budget for the Ministry of Interior and Defense for that year.

By 1999, Jardines was a major shareholder in Cycle & Carriage, with a 24.6% stake. In 2002, Cycle & Carriage became a subsidiary of Jardines when Jardine Strategic increased its stake to over 50%. In recognition of its distinguished operating history, and in the interests of integration to Jardines, it was renamed Jardine Cycle & Carriage.
