## Career

Farmer worked for his father in the family business, Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry, through childhood, high school, and college.

In 1959, Farmer's father transferred operation of the business to Richard. In 1962, the company name was changed to Acme Uniform & Towel Supply to reflect the uniform rental growth segment. By 1966, Acme annual revenues had grown to $1.8 million.

In 1968 Farmer created a new company, Satellite Corp., to provide a centralized distribution system and to develop smaller uniform plants in major U.S. cities. In 1973, Satellite acquired Acme and became known as Cintas. The company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983.

He turned Mason, Ohio-based Cintas from a negative net worth of $34,000 into a Fortune 500 company with annual sales of $3.8 billion. Today Cintas works with over 800,000 other clients.

Cintas is not only the nation's leading corporate uniform provider, but beginning in 1996 it greatly diversified and currently manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products, first aid and safety products, fire protection services and document management services.

Farmer served as Cintas Corporation's CEO from 1968 to August 1, 1995. He served as chairman from 1968 until his retirement on October 20, 2009, when he assumed the role of chairman emeritus and remained on the board of directors.
