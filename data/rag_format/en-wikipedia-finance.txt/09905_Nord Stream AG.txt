Nord Stream AG


# Nord Stream AG



**Nord Stream AG** is a consortium for construction and operation of the Nord Stream 1 submarine pipeline between Vyborg in Russia and Greifswald in Germany. The consortium was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland, on 30 November 2005.

Since the first gas delivery in 2011, the company has transported over 450 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Europe. In 2020, the German Federal Network Agency highlighted again the Nord Stream Pipeline's contribution to security of energy supply in Europe.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Gas deliveries ceased on 31 August 2022, officially for three days of maintenance. However on 2 September 2022, the company announced that natural gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would remain shut off indefinitely until the main gas turbine at the Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg was fixed due to an engine oil leak. Finally, on 26 September 2022 both pipelines of Nord Stream 1 were sabotaged beyond repair. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine Germany had halted the permitting process for Nord Stream 2 which although technically ready had therefore never delivered gas when also one of its two pipelines was destroyed by the Nord Stream sabotage.
