## Biography

Folsom received his B.A. from Indiana University in 1970, his M.A. from the University of Nebraska in 1973, and his doctorate in history from the University of Pittsburgh in 1976. Since 1988 he has edited *Continuity: A Journal of History*. He is a frequent columnist in the libertarian *Freeman* magazine and also contributes to other publications, writing in favor of free market economics and limited government.

Folsom is a former associate of the Free Enterprise Institute and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, both free market think tanks, and a frequent guest of the libertarian organization Foundation for Economic Education.


## Academic contributions

Folsom has written several books that argue against commonly held views about the role of capitalism in the social developments of the Industrial Revolution and the Gilded Age. He believes the term robber barons is a misnomer, and that many leaders in big business were constructive visionaries who benefited consumers and were integral to the development of industry.

In his book *The Myth of the Robber Barons*, Folsom distinguishes between *political entrepreneurs*, who ran inefficient businesses supported by government favors, and *market entrepreneurs*, who succeeded by providing better and lower-cost products or services, usually while facing vigorous competition.

Folsom identifies the following people as market entrepreneurs:

* John Jacob Astor
* James J. Hill
* John D. Rockefeller
* Charles M. Schwab
* Cornelius Vanderbilt

He regards these people as political entrepreneurs:

* Robert Fulton: steamboat inventor and submarine designer.
* Thomas McKenney
* Henry Villard
* Warren Buffett

Folsom writes about economics and US history for several large publications, including *The Wall Street Journal* and the *National Review*. In a 2010 *Wall Street Journal* editorial, Folsom argues that the New Deal did not contribute to economic recovery and may have actually exacerbated the Great Depression. Folsom argues that the New Deal did little more than trade temporary poverty relief for crippling tax rates and mountains of debt, and that the post-war recovery is best attributed to the rollback of taxes and regulations imposed under the New Deal.

Folsom has created several short videos for the conservative educational website Prager University. His lessons focus on the history of American economic development and entrepreneurs such as John D. Rockefeller:

* Why Is America So Rich?
* Why Private Investment Works and Government Investment Doesn't
* Rockefeller: The Richest American Who Ever Lived
