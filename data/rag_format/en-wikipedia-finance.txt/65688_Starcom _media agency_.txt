# Starcom (media agency)



**Starcom** is an international media network, the third-largest communications group globally, part of France’s Publicis, with headquarters in Chicago.


## History

The global holding company Starcom Mediavest Group was formed in 2000. Jack Klues, who had been the Chief Executive Officer of Starcom Worldwide, was named SMG’s first CEO upon its formation. Former CEO Laura Desmond became one of the business world’s youngest CEOs ever when she was named to the position in 2008.

In recent years, SMG has had partnerships with companies such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Acxiom, Tencent and more involving data, analytics and "technology-fueled creativity".

SMG also reorganized into 3 divisions—Connections (media brands), Content (creative assets), and Tech solutions (RUN, extech)—to reflect the fact that it now derives more than 50% of its business from digital, content, and data/analytics.
