## Background

Chan was born in Hong Kong with family roots in Chaoyang, Canton, also known by his Thai name **Charnwut Sophonpanich** (Thai: ชาญวุฒิ โสภณพนิช; RTGS: **Chanwut Sophonphanit**). He is the grandson of Chin Sophonpanich, the late Thai Chinese founder of Bangkok Bank. He graduated from The Hill School in 1983 and Pomona College in 1988 with a BA in Studio Art. He is an investor in Thailand's Bumrungrad International Hospital.

Chan is the Convener of the Non-official Members of the Executive Council, appointed by Carrie Lam in July 2017. He was a member of the Legislative Council (Legco) from 1998 to 2008, representing the Insurance constituency. He became a Hong Kong Deputy to National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China in 2008. He chairs several government advisory bodies: the Advisory Committee on Revitalizing Historical Buildings, the Standing Committee on Judicial Salaries and Condition of Services and the Hong Kong Council for Sustainable Development. He chaired the Antiquities Advisory Board from 2009–2013 and the Standing Committee on Disciplined Services Salaries and Condition of Services from 2001–2006.

In September 2023, he succeeded Tung Chee-hwa as chairman of Our Hong Kong Foundation, a prominent local think tank.

Outside of politics, he is President of Asia Financial Holdings and its main subsidiary, Asia Insurance.

Among his business successes are the formation in 1999 of Bank Consortium Trust, a joint venture of nine Hong Kong institutions that provides Mandatory Provident Fund services and of which he was founding chairman. He is also Chairman of The Hong Kong Council of Social Service, chair of the Hong Kong-Thailand Business Council, chairman of the council of Lingnan University and vice-chairman of Oxfam Hong Kong; he is also chairman of the annual HK Oxfam Trailwalker event – a fund-raising 100-kilometre race that attracts teams from around the world. He played a part in the creation of Caring Company, a framework that creates partnerships between the business and welfare sectors. Chan has been awarded Commander (third class) of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand, the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM), the Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS) and Justice of the Peace (JP).

He held American and Thai citizenship until 2004, when he was appointed member of the executive council and was required to relinquish all other nationalities.

In April 2021, he wrote an opinion piece, claiming that the NPCSC's decision to reform elections and only allow "patriots" to serve in the government was good and that "Taxpayers should welcome the revamp."

In December 2021, it was reported that Chan was eligible to vote four times in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election, yielding 0.0411561% of the total voting value (elected seats), which is 8280 times more than the value of an average voter's total voting value.

In October 2022, Chan admitted that Singapore's government was the "winner" over Hong Kong's, in COVID-19 pandemic measures. Chan also said that Hong Kong's talent acquisition was hurt by its COVID-19 measures, and that the city was "too confident" in the past.

In November 2022, after the government sent a delegation to Thailand, Chan said "It sent a message to both locals and the outside world that Hong Kong is returning to normalcy."

The academy works closely with parents to nurture their children to their fullest potential. Effective 1 January 2013, the academy changed its status to a not for profit organisation and also took the opportunity to change the English name of the school to Grace Christian Academy.
