The bank was one of the first savings banks in Norway to adapt the new legal regulations for the financial sector in Norway by forming Sparebankstiftinga Sogn og Fjordane. The bank's own funds were converted into equity share capital and primary capital. Sparebankstiftinga Sogn og Fjordane owns 94,12% and Sparebankstiftinga Fjaler owns the remaining 5,88% of the equity certificates. Consequently, the bank has a new executive committee and a new board of directors from September 2010. The chairman of the board is Hallgeir Kleppe. Elin Schei Stuhaug is chairwoman of the new executive committee, consisting of 45 members.

The Bank has entered into a strategic alliance with Frende Forsikring ASA. This means that all customers in the bank also can buy their insurances there.
