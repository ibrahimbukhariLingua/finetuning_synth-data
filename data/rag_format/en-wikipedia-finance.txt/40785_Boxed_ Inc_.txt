## History

Boxed was founded by Chieh Huang, Christopher Cheung, William Fong, and Jared Yaman. The mobile app launched in August 2013 and allows customers to shop for wholesale products and have them delivered. Huang got the idea when he was living in New York City and did not have the same ability to shop at the wholesale clubs as he did while growing up in New Jersey. With their background in mobile gaming, the team created an app for iPhone and Android, and several months later, launched the Boxed website at Boxed.com.

The company first started shipping out of Huang's garage in Edison, New Jersey, before opening their first fulfillment center, also in Edison, in December 2013.

In May 2014, Boxed launched Express, its on-demand grocery delivery service, available in most of New York City, parts of New Jersey, and Boston. Customers can shop bulk sizes of fresh and frozen groceries and choose a delivery date and time.

In January 2017, the Today Show profiled Boxed as the wholesale shopping app for millennials, and highlighted the company's benefits, and in 2018, Business Insider compared it to Costco.

In 2018, Boxed launched a membership program called Boxed Up.

In May 2019, Lidl partnered with Boxed to deliver groceries. In July 2019, Prentis Wilson joined Boxed as president. In August 2019, Boxed announced a partnership with New York-based retailer, Century 21 to create a line of beauty and clothing items. It was the first time that Boxed had been offering those items to customers through its service, although the partnership ended due to Century 21 filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 10, 2020.

On August 18, 2023, Boxed was acquired by MSG Distributors, who currently has plans to relaunch the brand later this year.

In July 2024 Boxed relaunched its website and mobile app.


## Features

Boxed customers can shop on desktop, via the Boxed iOS app or Android app.

In August 2017, Boxed launched SMART Stock up, a feature that applies machine learning on customer data to predict when they will most likely run low on a particular product. It sends a reminder to customers when they log in, making it easy and convenient to re-purchase what they need.

In tandem with SMART Stock up, Boxed launched Concierge, an autonomous shopping concept that uses the same machine learning to not only predict when a user is running low, but pre-emptively fulfill and send a customer's product to them without them needing to engage at all. It is currently available only to B2B customers.
