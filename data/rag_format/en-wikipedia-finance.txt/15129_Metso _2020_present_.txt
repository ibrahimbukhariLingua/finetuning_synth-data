## Organization

Metso's president and CEO Sami Takaluoma [fi] became the company's president and CEO.

In February 2023, Metso Outotec board of directors announced a proposal to shareholders on company name change from Metso Outotec Corporation to Metso Corporation. The grounds for the proposal were that the post-merger integration of the two companies had been completed and that the company strategy going forward focused on a strong unified company brand. Shareholder vote on the proposal was scheduled for annual general meeting on 3 May 2023. The name was changed on 4 May 2023.

On November 1, 2024 Sami Takaluoma became President and CEO.
