## History

In 2005, the Federal Government of Nigeria privatized NIRMSCO Properties Limited – the owner of the Nicon Hilton Hotel, Abuja at the time. As part of a consortium, Transcorp plc purchased a proprietary stake in the company and became the core investor, while the federal government retained the remaining 49 per cent. Hilton International LLC was engaged to manage the property.

In 2007, the name NIRMSCO Properties Limited was changed to Transnational Hotels & Tourism Services Limited (THTSL). THTSL was the hospitality subsidiary of Transcorp.

In 2013, Transcorp bought out other consortium members and became the sole owner of the 51 per cent controlling shares in THTSL. It secured hosting rights for the World Economic Forum on Africa in 2014.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
