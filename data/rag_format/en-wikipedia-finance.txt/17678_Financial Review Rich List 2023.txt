# Financial Review Rich List 2023



The ***Financial Review* Rich List 2023** is the 40th annual survey of the 200 wealthiest people resident in Australia, published by the *Australian Financial Review* on 26 May 2023.

The net worth of the wealthiest individual, Gina Rinehart, was $37.41 billion; while the net worth of the 200th wealthiest individual, Bob Rose and his wife, Margaret, and their family, was $690 million; up from $640 million for the 200th individual in 2022. The combined wealth of the 200 individuals was calculated as $563 bn, an increase of $9 bn on the previous year; compared with a combined wealth of $6.4 bn in 1984 when the *BRW* Rich 200 commenced. Thirty-six women were included on the 2023 Rich List, representing 18 percent of the list; down from thirty-nine women in 2021, or 19.5%. The list included six debutants.

Rinehart held the mantle of Australia's wealthiest individual between 2011 and 2015; and was also the wealthiest Australian individual since 2020. From 2017 to 2019, Anthony Pratt was Australia's wealthiest individual, ranked fourth in the 2021 Rich List, after Andrew Forrest, Australia's wealthiest individual in 2008, and Mike Cannon-Brookes.
