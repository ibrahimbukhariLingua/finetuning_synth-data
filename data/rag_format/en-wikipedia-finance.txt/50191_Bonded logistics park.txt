Bonded logistics park


# Bonded logistics park



A **bonded logistics park** is a type of special economic zone. Trade arrangements are similar to that of a bonded warehouse but over a specific geographic area. Sometimes with international port capabilities. Goods may be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.


## China

Chinaâ€™s bonded logistic parks have similar rules to free-trade zones (another specific type of special economic zone) except for export VAT refund. Export VAT refund is eligible for a Chinese company once their goods enter the park.
