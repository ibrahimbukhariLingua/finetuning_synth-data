## History

ABM was founded as a single-person window washing business. As of 2013, the company has over 130,000 employees, over 350 offices, and various international locations.


### 1909–1944

In 1909, Morris Rosenberg, the company's founder, began cleaning shopkeepers' windows in San Francisco, CA. The company took the name American Building Maintenance in 1913 and acquired Easterday Janitorial Supply Company in 1927.

In the 1920s and 1930s, ABM grew its business on the West Coast by offering annual cleaning contracts to businesses. In 1921, ABM became the first janitorial contractor in America to clean a major college campus after contracting to clean Stanford University.

When Rosenberg died in 1935, his oldest son, Theodore "Ted" Rosenberg, became president and his younger son Sydney joined the company in 1937. Ted purchased an electrical company in that same year and ABM cleaned Navy ships and installed wiring on Water Buffalo amphibious vehicles during World War II. By the end of the war, ABM had grown to 17 offices in the U.S. and Canada.


### 1945–1999

ABM's growth continued throughout the post-war years and the company went public in 1962 in the over-the-counter market with Ted serving as chairman and Sydney as CEO. Ted remained involved with ABM until his death in 2010 serving on the board of directors and the late Sydney retired as a director in December 1997.

In 1965, ABM went from the over-the-counter stock market, to being listed on the NYSE American. In the late 1960s, ABM acquired the companies later known as Ampco System Parking, CommAir Mechanical, Amtech Elevator Services and Amtech Lighting Services. In 1971, ABM made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABM. ABM Engineering was established in the early 1990s and received ISO 9002 certification in 1999. By the end of 1999, ABM employed over 55,000 people and reported annual sales revenue over $1.6 billion.
