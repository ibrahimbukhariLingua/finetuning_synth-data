#### Media Squabble with Public Bank Group

After Phan's resignation with the Public Bank Group, he was given a notice period to vacate his position before establishing Oriental Bank PLC with then partners - G Capital Berhad, a public listed company from Malaysia and E S Packaging from Cambodia. However, an article published by The Edge (Malaysia) might have caused some tension between Phan and the management of the Public Bank Group, as the latter quickly issued a statement to deny any involvement in the venture The Edge (Malaysia). Following the media statement released by Public Bank, the share prices of G Capital Berhad fell.

Phan started his new position as the MD & CEO of Oriental Bank PLC in 2021.
