## History

Manulife Bank is a Schedule I federally chartered bank that was established on January 1, 1993, when Cabot Trust Company, Huronia Trust Company and the Regional Trust Company were merged by Manulife Financial. Its branch network was sold to the Laurentian Bank of Canada later in 1993 and it became Canada's first bank to sell its products through independent financial advisors.

In 1999, the Advantage Account was launched - a high-interest savings account.

In 1999, Manulife One was launched - Canada’s first "all-in-one" account. Manulife One allowed Canadians to combine their mortgage and other debts with their chequing and savings accounts to simplify their banking and make their money work more efficiently.

In 2001, telephone and internet banking was introduced to provide customers with 24-hour self-service.

In 2003, the Business Advantage Account was launched - a high-interest account for small business owners.

In 2016, Manulife was fined by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) for "violations [of] a technical nature". Manulife was originally levied a $1.5 million fine, which was subsequently reduced to $1.15 million.

In 2017, Manulife Bank launched the ManulifeMoney+ Visa Infinite and ManulifeMoney+ Visa Platinum Cards.

In 2019, Manulife Bank launched the All-In Banking Package, an integrated banking package and mobile app that rewards customers for saving money each month.
