## History

The history of United Coffee dates back to 1818 when a small shop roaster, Mr. Sweens and his family, founded the company, then named Drie Mollen, in 's-Hertogenbosch (den Bosch) in the south of the Netherlands. By the late 1900s, Drie Mollen had begun its development into an international coffee roasting business. By the 1990s, five leading tea and coffee companies had joined the original founding Sweens family, and the business continued to grow and develop.

In 2008, CapVest, the private equity fund, bought Drie Mollen. In March 2010, the company was rebranded United Coffee and its head office was moved from the Netherlands to Geneva. In 2012, CapVest sold United Coffee to UCC Holdings Limited.
