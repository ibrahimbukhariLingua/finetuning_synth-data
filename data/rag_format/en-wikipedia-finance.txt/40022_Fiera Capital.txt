## History

In July 2003, Fiera International Inc. (a wholly owned company of Jean-Guy Desjardins) came to an agreement with Desjardins Group to spin off Elantis Investment Management to form a new asset management firm named Fiera Capital. 70% will be owned by Fiera International while 30% would remain with Desjardins. It started with CA$5 billion in assets under management (AUM).

In 2005, Fiera started launching alternative strategy products with its first one being a market neutral strategy. The decision to do so was made as many traditional firms did not offer such strategies to investors at the time.

In October 2005, Fiera acquired Senecal Investment Counsel to increase its institutional investment strength.

In February 2006, Fiera acquired YMG Capital to increase its strength in private wealth-management. Ater the acquisition, Fiera AUM increased to CA$26 billion.

In early 2012, Fiera acquired Natcan Investment Management, the asset management subsidiary of National Bank of Canada. Fiera paid CA$309.5 million in cash and shares to National Bank leading to it having a 35% stake in Fiera. Fiera's AUM increased to CA$54 billion which was almost double its previous size. Around the same time Fiera rebranded from Fiera Sceptre back to Fiera Capital.

In October 2013, Fiera acquired Los Angeles-based wealth-management firm Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC and New York-based investment manager Wilkinson O’Grady & Co. for CA$156.3 million.

In January 2021, Fiera sold Bel Air Investment Advisors to Hightower Advisors and sold Wilkinson Global Asset Management (a new entity consisting of Wilkinson O’Grady & Co's assets and employees) to Wilkinson Capital Partners.
