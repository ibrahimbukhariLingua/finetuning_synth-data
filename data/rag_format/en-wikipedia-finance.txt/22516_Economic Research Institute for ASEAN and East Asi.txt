### Providing Policy Recommendations

One of the most important ERIA's works is providing policy recommendations to leaders, ministers in ASEAN and EAS through East Asia Summit and ASEAN Summit, and another related meetings. As ERIA's mission expands by receiving instructions and task-outs from Summits and Ministerial Meetings, ERIA's role as the "Center of Excellence" in ASEAN and East Asia becomes increasingly important.

* At the 5th East Asia Summit and the 17th ASEAN Summit held in October 2010 in Vietnam
 Heads of government of ASEAN Member States commended ERIA's contribution in "Comprehensive Asia Development Plan (CADP)" and "Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity"
* At the 16th ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting held in November 2010 in Brunei Darussalam
 The Ministers expressed their high appreciation to the ERIA for its valuable support in conducting the Final Report on the ASEAN Strategic Transport Plan (ASTP) 2011–2015.

## Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia

The ERIA is tasked with reviewing the proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia or CEPEA, the Japanese proposed trade bloc involving the 16 nations of the East Asia Summit. It was decided at the Third East Asia Summit that the ERIA report on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia would be received at the Fourth East Asia Summit. The Fourth EAS was delayed for almost a year by reason of difficulties in the host nation Thailand.

With the subsequent change of government in Japan, and the discussion by the new administration of the East Asia Community the future of CEPEA is not yet clear.

Subsequently, the Fourth East Asia Summit supported further development on trading groupings based around the 13 country ASEAN Plus Three and the 16 country East Asia Summit.

At the subsequent APEC conference Australia announced a million Australian dollars in funding to ERIA to support research into the 16 country bloc.


## Major works

ERIA's works are divided into 3 fields, doing research works, disseminating its works, and providing policy recommendations.


### Research works


#### Deepening economic integration


#### Narrowing Development Gaps


#### Sustainable Economic Development
