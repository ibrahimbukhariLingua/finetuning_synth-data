# Syrian Petroleum Company



The **Syrian Petroleum Company** (**SPC**, Arabic: شركة النفط السورية) is a state-owned oil exploration and production company. The company was established in 1974.

SPC operated fields around Al-Sweidiyeh in the Al-Hasakah Governorate, including Al-Houla, Shadada, Jbeissa, Sweidiya and Rumailan. In March 2011, SPC produced about 55% of total oil produced in Syria. On 18 August 2011, SPC was put into the United States sanctions list due to the Syrian civil war.

China’s state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) has large stakes in one of Syria's biggest oil companies the Al-Furat Petroleum Company, as well as in a number of Syrian oil fields. India has made two significant investments in Syria in the oil sector in the pre-conflict days. First, an agreement was signed in January 2004 between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and IPR International for exploration of oil and natural gas in Block 24 near Deir ez-Zor in northern Syria. Second, investments by India's ONGC and China's CNPC to jointly acquire the 37% stake of PetroCanada in the Syrian Al Furat Petroleum Company. The conflict and subsequent sanctions have slowed ONGC's operations in Syria.
