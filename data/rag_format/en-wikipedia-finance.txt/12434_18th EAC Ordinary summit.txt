## Agenda


### Economic Partnership Agreement

The key agenda of the meeting was the EU-EAC Economic partnership agreement. Museveni reiterated that countries such as Kenya and Rwanda that have signed the agreement should not be penalized by the European Union and the countries that have not signed the agreement can not sign the agreement pending various clarifications from the EU. Museveni agreed to lead a delegation of the bloc economic members to Europe to solve various disagreements.


### Burundi

The Burundian unrest was discussed as one of the problems during the tenure of John Magufuli and that not much progress has been made to resolve the issue. The summit was not attended by Pierre Nkurunziza, president of Burundi. The delay in the resolution was attributed to the lack of motivation between the disputed parties to negotiate a settlement. Furthermore, the leaders iterated the EU to lift sanctions on Burundi.


### Somalia

The leaders read the report on the admission criteria of Somalia into the East African community. Various local leaders warned against the admission of the war torn country until the country can fix its security issues.
