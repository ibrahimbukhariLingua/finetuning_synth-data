**Jason Goepfert** (born November 1971) is an American researcher and columnist focused on the development of behavioral finance. Prior to founding Sundial Capital Research, he was the manager of back office operations for Deephaven Capital Management, a Minnesota-based hedge fund, and Wells Fargo's online brokerage unit.


## Early life

Goepfert was born in Grantsburg, Wisconsin. He was educated at Grantsburg High School, followed by the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management where he was president of the freshman student council and member of the crew team.

After attending the university and joining a large community and investment bank, he developed proprietary indicators based on activity in the margin and options accounts. Once he left the finance industry, he created a newsletter and accompanying website that has become a primary source for investors looking for information related specifically to the objective measurement of sentiment data and education of investors.


## Career

Goepfert founded Sundial Capital Research as a conduit for his research into behavioral finance. He consulted for numerous prominent hedge funds and Wall Street banks before creating a retail product and contributing to broadcasts for U.S. and overseas financial publications, radio and television on the CNN, Fox and CNBC networks.

He has been interviewed or profiled in publications such as *Traders*, *Stocks, Futures & Options*, *Futures* and *Independent Research* magazines and spoken at numerous industry conferences for organizations such as the Market Technicians Association, National Association of Active Investment Managers and Minyanville Media.

In 2004, Goepfert was awarded the Charles H. Dow Award for excellence in the field of technical analysis by the Market Technicians Association. In the weeks after the award was given, a member of the MTA noticed that the work was similar to that of Norman Fosback in the 1970s. A subsequent investigation revealed that neither Goepfert nor members of the award committee were aware of Mr. Fosback's work. The committee determined that the paper still advanced the field of technical analysis and investor sentiment, so a revised version of the paper was released, and the MTA changed the way that the award is reviewed in order to increase the likelihood that a committee member would be familiar with prior work in the field that is not necessarily widely published or cited.
