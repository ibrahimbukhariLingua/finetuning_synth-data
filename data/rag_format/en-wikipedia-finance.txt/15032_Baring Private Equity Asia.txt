Baring Private Equity Asia


# Baring Private Equity Asia



**Baring Private Equity Asia** (BPEA) was an Asian investment firm headquartered in Hong Kong. It was founded in 1997 as an affiliate of Barings Bank before becoming an independent firm in 2000.

In 2022, it was acquired by EQT AB to act as its Asian investment platform. It was subsequently renamed to BPEA EQT and then EQT Private Capital Asia.


## History

BPEA was founded in 1997 as a subsidiary of Baring Private Equity Partners which was an affiliate of Barings Bank. In addition to BPEA, the affiliates of Baring Private Equity Partners include Baring Vostok Capital Partners, Baring Private Equity Partners India and GP Investments.

Jean Salata and two other senior colleagues from the investment arm of AIG were set to run it with the ING Group providing $300 million in seed money. However, the two colleagues pulled out and ING downsized its commitment to $25 million due to the collapse or Barings Bank and the Asian financial crisis. However, despite the difficult circumstances, Salata recruited a team and deployed capital into NetEase and Mphasis. These successful investments allowed BPEA to raise $300 million for its debut fund in 1999.

In 2000, Salata led a management buyout of BPEA leading it to be established as an independent Firm. The firm would keep the Barings brand name and the ING relationship in exchange for a share of the profits for a limited period.

In 2016, Affiliated Managers Group acquired a 15% minority stake in BPEA.

In 2017, BPEA launched its Credit investment unit in India after acquiring the Credit unit of Religare Global Asset Management.

In March 2022, EQT AB acquired BPEA for $7.5 billion. On October, the acquisition was complete and the firm was renamed to BPEA EQT.

In January 2024, the firm was rebranded to EQT Private Capital Asia.
