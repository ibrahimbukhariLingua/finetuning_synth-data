Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)


# Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)



**Euro gold and silver commemorative coins** are special euro coins minted and issued by member states of the Eurozone, mainly in gold and silver, although other precious metals are also used in rare occasions. Monaco was one of the first countries allowed to introduced the euro (€) on 1 January 2002, although they are not officially part of the Eurozone. Since then, the Monnaie de Paris in France have been minting both normal issues of Monégasque euro coins, which are intended for circulation, and commemorative euro coins in gold and silver.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

These special coins have a legal tender only in Monaco, unlike the normal issues of the Monegasque euro coins, which have a legal tender in every country of the Eurozone. This means that the commemorative coins made of gold and silver cannot be used as money in other countries. Furthermore, as their bullion value and collectable value generally vastly exceeds their face value, these coins are not intended to be used as means of payment at all—although it remains possible. For this reason, they are usually named **collectors' coins**.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The coins usually commemorate the anniversaries of historical events or draw attention to current events of special importance. Monaco mints one type of these coins on average per year, in both gold and silver, with face value ranging from 5 to 100 euros.


## Summary

As of 28 December 2008, seven variations of Monegasque euro commemorative coins have been minted: one in 2002, two in 2003, one in 2004, one in 2005 and two in 2008. These special high-value commemorative coins are not to be confused with €2 commemorative coins, which are coins designated for circulation and do have legal tender status in all countries of the Eurozone.
