As bank of the Catholic *Steyler Missionsorden*, it is also committed to the missionary mission, justice, peace, and the integrity of creation. It also offers foundation advisory services and as of 2013ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ manages 197 trustee foundations.


## History

The bank was founded on 4 December 1963 under the name *Steyler Missionssparinstitut Sankt Augustin GmbH*. After being entered in the German Trade Register on February 13, 1964, the bank began operations. Previously, the *Steyler Missionare* had already been entrusted with funds whose interest income the missionaries could use for their work. This was no longer allowed by the *Bankenaufsicht* in 1964, so that the *Steyler Missionare* decided to found their own bank.

While the focus was still in the classic field of investment until the late 1990s, from 2000 the securities sector was added. In this context, the name was changed to *Steyler Bank GmbH* in 1999. In 2002, the branch in Austria was opened. On 1 June 2018, it was transferred from the Mission House *St. Gabriel in Maria Enzersdorf* to the city center of Vienna, because the previous rooms were needed by the Order for a different purpose.


## Fields of activity


### Customers

Only about 25% of the approximately 16,000 customers come from the metropolitan area of Cologne/Bonn. The much larger number comes from the entire German federal territory with a focus on the southern German area. The Steyler bank is also active internationally. Customers do not have to be Catholic, live in the area of the Archdiocese of Cologne or be employed by a church sponsor. This distinguishes the Steyler Bank from similar church banks of other Religious denominations.


### Interest

The Steyler Bank pays marketable and usual interest rates. The customer decides whether a certain percentage of his interest will be made available to the Steyler mission's projects.


### Securities

The Steyler Bank has been raising two separate funds since 2012. These are a stock and a pension fund. (Sustainability Fund together with the bank *M.M.Warburg & CO*). However, the Steyler Bank's equity fund also contains investments in controversial companies, which the bank points to in a watchlist. With €2.5 million fund shares, the bank owns just under 18% of the €15 million equity fund itself. (As of June 30, 2013). Customers are also offered securities of other companies that meet defined social, cultural and environmental criteria.


### Ethical investment

A key focus of the Steyler Bank is ethical, sustainable, or ESG investments. If the customer so wishes, they can use certain criteria to determine which exclusion criteria they wants to apply to their investments.

The applied criteria go back to the *Frankfurt-Hohenheimer Leitfaden* by Johannes Hofmann.
