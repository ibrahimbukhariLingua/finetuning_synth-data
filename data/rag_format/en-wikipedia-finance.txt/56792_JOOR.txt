# JOOR



**JOOR** is a SaaS company that built an online B2B Marketplace connecting brands and retailers to streamline their wholesale business.
JOOR is also a data analytics company.

JOOR has 8,600 brands and 350,000 retailers on the platform. Al Tayer was the 28th retail company on the Joor Pro system. Global in scope, JOOR clients include Neiman Marcus and Kate Spade and Balenciaga. The company has 250 employees including 100 in New York City. Others in sales and customer support roles are in Paris, Madrid, London, Milan, Melbourne, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

When Kristin Savilia stepped into the CEO shoes at JOOR, the tech team only included two females, which represented less than five percent of the team. Eighteen short months later, the JOOR tech organization (Engineering, Product and Quality Assurance) is 33% women, well exceeding the industry average of 13.5%.

In February 2019, the company raised a Series C round, where it also reported that Joor’s platform has netted $23 billion in gross merchandise volume across 3.68 million orders. Nearly half of these orders were placed and processed in the last 12 months.

In September 2019, JOOR announced the acquisition of B2B wholesale technology Veee, as well as a strategic partnership with Premium Group, a fashion trade show organizer in Europe.
