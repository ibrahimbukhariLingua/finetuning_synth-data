## Career

Renova Group is owned by Intrater's cousin, the Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg. Columbus Nova's biggest asset at the time was a controlling stake in CIFC, a publicly traded company that managed credit investments.

Partners, an investment vehicle of Qatar's royal family. Vekselberg's assets were frozen due to the economic sanctions against Russia.
