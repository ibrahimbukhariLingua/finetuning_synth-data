## History

Ericsson Nikola Tesla traces its roots back to the state-owned **Nikola Tesla Corporation** founded in 1949 in Zagreb, then SFR Yugoslavia. It was very successful in the local telecommunications market, and the regional markets, especially of Europe, for over forty years. It became a licence partner of Ericsson of Sweden in 1953, selling large volumes of Ericsson systems into the USSR and other markets from 1958.

In 1977, the company began making Ericsson AXE switches under licence.

With the collapse of Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia, the state began looking to privatize the corporation in the year 1992. By 1994, Ericsson emerged as the highest bidder and purchased a 49 percent share of the corporation —estimated at $40 million, and integrating operations to a significant extent by 1995.

In 2011, the company was Croatia's eighth largest exporter.
