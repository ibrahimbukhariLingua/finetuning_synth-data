## History


### As a building society

The Hindmarsh Building Society was established in 1877 in Hindmarsh, South Australia, on the principles that "home ownership is the cornerstone of a successful community and that owning a home should be possible for everyone". From 1877 to 1968 it was known as the Hindmarsh Loan, Land, Building and Investment Society, after which it became known as the Hindmarsh Building Society. In October 1974 the Hindmarsh Building Society was briefly subject to a "run". The State Premier, Don Dunstan, arrived with a loud-hailer to assure people that their money was safe and that the building society was backed by the state government. In 1977 it donated the "Mall's Balls" (*The Spheres* by Herbert Flugelman) to the City of Adelaide to mark the centenary of the society.

The Co-operative Building Society of South Australia Limited was founded by Alwin Fischer and incorporated in 1900,

and by 1990, the building society's asset base passed the $1 billion mark. In 1992 the Society amalgamated with the Hindmarsh Building Society.
