# Mullen Automotive



**Mullen Automotive, Inc.**, is an American automotive and electric vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Brea, California. Its products include passenger electric vehicles and commercial vehicles. The company is primarily involved in rebadging Chinese captive imports such as the Mullen Campus, Mullen One, Mullen Three, Mullen Go, and Mullen GT lines. The company intended to field a luxury vehicle, the Mullen Five, then pivot to all-consumer electric vehicle models. Development of the Mullen Five was cancelled in 2024. For the 12 months period ending September 30th 2024, Mullen lost 506 million dollars on revenue of 1 million dollars, and at the end of the period the company had 10 million dollars in cash.


## History

The Mullen Automotive brand was created by David Michery by combining the companies Mullen Motor Cars with Coda Automotive. Michery planned for rapid expansion of the company, but as of 2023 the company hasn't released a single vehicle since its inception except for imported Chinese vehicles. Mullen originally intended to launch the Dragonfly K50 luxury sports car, now called the Mullen GT and GTRS, in the U.S. by 2021. However as of March 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the company is still finalizing engineering. The vehicle is based heavily on the Qiantu K50.

On June 15, 2020, Mullen Technologies announced a merger agreement with payments-as-a-service platform Net Element, Inc., which was completed in November 2021. This reverse merger resulted in Mullen becoming a subsidiary of Net Element, and Net Element changing its name to Mullen Automotive, Inc.

On March 17, 2021, Mullen Technologies announced that they would open a factory in Memphis, Tennessee for the manufacture of their Mullen FIVE crossover SUV, with plans to sell these models as early as 2024. However, in November 2021, Mullen purchased a facility in nearby Robinsonville, Mississippi instead, forgoing the Tennessee site.

In February 2022, an article by Fuzzy Panda Research presented Mullen acquisition and bankrupt commercial EV manufacturer Electric Last Mile Solutions as an "EV Pretender – Passing Off Chinese Imports as "Made in the USA"; Booking Fake Revenue of Fully Returnable Products". In April 2022, an article by Hindenburg Research presented Mullen as one of "the worst [electric vehicle] hustles" in recent history.

In September 2022 Mullen purchased a controlling stake in Bollinger Motors, a manufacturer of EV pick-ups and SUVs, for $148.2 million This valued pre-revenue Bollinger Motors at $247 Million. In June 2022, Bollinger had little more than a month left of cash to cover operating expenses.

## Controversies


### CEO compensation and awards

Despite Mullen Automotive Inc being unprofitable, Michery has continued with a base salary of US$750,000 per year and received a number of performance awards totalling over $40M as of September 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ. At Mullen's 2023 annual shareholder's meeting, Michery was granted further 2023 performance awards. On August 31, 2023, Michery, along with Wes Christian, appeared on Fox Business's Making Money show hosted by Charles Payne to discuss the Mullen "Naked Shorting" lawsuit filed against TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and National Finance Services, in which Michery alleged illegal short selling of Mullen stock by the defendants. In the second half of the interview, Payne asked Michery about his compensation. Michery did not respond with an explanation before technical audio issues occurred. Charles Schwab has denied all of the charges.

In a press release the following day by Mullen, the company responded to the question of $31M in General and Administrative expenses for the company's third quarter but did not answer the question about the CEO's compensation.
