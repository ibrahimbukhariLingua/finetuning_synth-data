**Mark W. Yusko** is an American investor and hedge fund manager. He is the founder, chief investment officer and managing director of Morgan Creek Capital Management, an investment management firm that advises pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals.


## Investment career

From 1993 to 1998, he was a Senior Investment Director at the University of Notre Dame Investment Office. Yusko left Notre Dame in 1998 to head the endowment office at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. From 1998 to 2004, Yusko was founder and chief executive of the UNC Management Company. Yusko left UNC to found Morgan Creek Capital Management in 2004.

In 2004, Morgan Creek Capital Management, LLC partnered with Salient Partners LP to start The Endowment Fund. After reaching about $3.5 billion in assets, Yusko served as chief investment officer for the Fund until January 2013, when Yusko was removed for poor fund performance. Large redemptions by investors prompted The Endowment Fund in October 2012 to announce that investor withdrawals would be limited. In 2014, The Endowment Fund announced that investors could withdraw from the fund, but at significant discounts.

Yusko is a frequent commentator on the alternative investment industry and has appeared on CNBC, Bloomberg TV, Fox Business, and other major networks as well as in newspapers including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. He is a proponent of the Endowment Model of investing, which favors diversified strategies by asset class and within each asset class in both public and private markets.

The Yuskos’ benefaction was the third-largest gift in the University’s history and was substantial enough to land them on the *Slate* 60 list of the largest American charitable contributions of 2009.
