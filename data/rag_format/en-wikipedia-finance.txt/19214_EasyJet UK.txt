EasyJet UK


# EasyJet UK



**EasyJet UK Limited** (trading as **easyJet**) is a British low-cost airline and a subsidiary of EasyJet plc. It was founded in 2017, after the UK Government triggered Article 50 to leave the European Union.


## History

The airline was established following the UK referendum vote to leave the European Union and the airline's preparation against possible outcomes of Brexit. EasyJet structured itself as a pan-European airline group with three different air operator's certificates, each based in Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

EasyJet plc is thus a pan-European airline group with three airlines based in the UK, Austria and Switzerland (easyJet UK, easyJet Europe, and easyJet Switzerland), all fully or part-owned by easyJet plc, based in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
