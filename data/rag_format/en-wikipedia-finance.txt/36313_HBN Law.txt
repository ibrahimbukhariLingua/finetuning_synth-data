## History

HBN Law & Tax was founded in 1938 when S.W. van der Meer established Law office Van der Meer in Curaçao, then in the Netherlands Antilles. At the end of the forties begin fifties of the 20th century, Van der Meer associated with Mr. Ronchi Isa. The firm changed names over the years and became Halley & Blaauw in 1991, named after its partners Lucius Halley and Rob Blaauw.

In 1993 Rob Blaauw moved the firm’s office from Pietermaai to the newly restored historic Villa Belvédère in Otrobanda. Back then all law firms were concentrated around Pietermaai and Punda. Otrobanda was considered a poor area with no business opportunities.

Nelson Navarro joined the firm’s partnership in 1993 and the firm renamed into Halley Blaauw & Navarro.

Eric R. de Vries joined the firm's partnership in 1997. In 2005 Eric R. de Vries became the managing partner and the firm changed its name into HBN Law. Eric R. de Vries is internationally recognized as one of the best lawyers in the Dutch Caribbean.

The firm rapidly expanded and became leading on all Dutch Caribbean islands ever since, with international arbitration and litigation practices from their offices in Amsterdam and Curaçao.

In June 2019 with the joining of several tax advisors including tax partner Wendell Meriaan, the firm changed its name to HBN Law & Tax.

HBN Law & Tax currently has circa 60 attorneys and tax advisors, 15 equity and salary partners, and a total workforce of over 100 people.
