# McCoy's Building Supply



**McCoy’s Building Supply Company** (McCoy's) is a regional, family-owned building materials retailer that has been in operation for over 90 years. Headquartered in San Marcos, Texas, McCoy’s has grown to become one of the largest privately held independent building supply companies in the United States. The company operates primarily in Texas, but it also has a presence in neighboring states like Louisiana and Oklahoma.


## History

McCoy’s Building Supply was founded in 1927 in Galveston, Texas, by F.R. McCoy, as a small, local lumber business. The company’s early focus was on providing construction materials like lumber and hardware to local builders, contractors, ranchers and DIY'ers.

Over the decades, McCoy’s expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of building supplies, including plumbing, electrical, paint, flooring, and home improvement products. The company is still privately held by the McCoy family, with leadership passing down through several generations.

In 2024, USA Today listed McCoy's as one of America's top retailers, as reviewed by consumers.


## Retail Operations

McCoy’s Building Supply operates more than 90 retail locations across Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, making it one of the largest independently owned building supply chains in the region. The company serves a broad customer base, ranging from individual homeowners and DIY enthusiasts to professional contractors and commercial builders. Its stores offer a wide variety of building materials, including:

* Lumber and wood products
* Roofing materials
* Drywall and insulation
* Paint and coatings
* Plumbing and electrical supplies
* Tools and hardware
* Home improvement products

In addition to its retail operations, McCoy’s operates distribution centers and maintains a fleet of delivery vehicles to support its extensive network of stores. The company emphasizes convenience and customer service, offering online ordering and delivery for customers, as well as custom-cutting services for products like lumber and drywall. McCoy's also provides professional design consultations and building project support, helping contractors and homeowners with planning and materials selection.

In the 2020s, McCoy's started to introduce robotics into its retail locations. These robots were introduced to provide ongoing tracking of inventory and retail prices.


## Finances

As a privately held company, McCoy’s Building Supply does not publicly disclose detailed financial information. However, in 2020, McCoy's reported revenue in the $1 billion range, driven by both strong demand in the construction sector and growth in retail sales. In addition to its retail and wholesale operations, McCoy’s has invested in modernizing its logistics and distribution systems to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
