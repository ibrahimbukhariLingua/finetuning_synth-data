## History

* 1986 - Laurie Connell and Alan Bond both buy 25% stakes in the site in 1986 in partnership with the State Superannuation Board, as part of WA Inc.
* 1988 - The site, then part of the Perth Technical College site, was sold to Kerry Packer and Warren Anderson for $270 million. One office building on what was renamed "Westralia Square" was constructed. The development is mired in WA state politics, and the deal will later be scrutinised in detail by the WA Inc Royal Commission. Kerry Packer famously declares: "All West Australians are crooks."
* 1990s - A $2 billion development by Indonesia's Samma Group collapses.
* 2003 - Kerry Packer sells the site to Multiplex and Stowe for $19 million, taking a loss of $200 million. Multiplex and Griffin agree to carve up the Westralia Square property. Griffin has a smaller area on Mounts Bay Road and Multiplex has the prime location fronting St Georges Terrace.
* December 2007 - BHP signs the biggest office leasing deal in Perth's history—60,000 m² (650,000 sq ft).
* March 2008 - Perth's Lord Mayor announces that BHP will be headquartering in Perth, and their Melbourne operations will be significantly downgraded. (This is confirmed in August 2014).

## Design

Brookfield Place Tower is the tallest side core commercial building in the southern hemisphere. Designed by Hassell and Fitzpatrick + Partners, it included the restoration of the surrounding historic Newspaper House Group of Buildings, comprising four heritage-listed buildings, constructed between 1910 and 1932.

The offset core protects the enclosed space by buffering the façade against the adverse northern sun and the associated solar heat gain. Externally, the expressive structural east and west exoskeletons create the distinctive tower aesthetic. The vertical expression of the tower structure accentuates the height of the building, which terminates in a tapered structural roof crown.

Tower 2 was designed by Woods Bagot. It features large column-free floor plates of approximately 2,100 m² (23,000 sq ft). The project also incorporates a sheltered upper-level walkway across Mounts Bay Road to provide greater connectivity between the Elizabeth Quay bus station, Elizabeth Quay railway station and Perth's CBD.
