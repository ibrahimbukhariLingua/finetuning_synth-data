## History

The company was founded in 1997 by Greg Gianforte in Bozeman, Montana as RightNow Technologies. Additional offices were opened in California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, Washington, DC, Colorado, Canada, Europe, Australia and Asia. The company employed over 1000 people in 2011.
RightNow's business model was software as a service using cloud computing.

Gianforte started the company in 1997 without external capital and created a software product that was initially focused on customer service with an integrated knowledge base. As the company grew, it added marketing and sales functionality, voice automation, customer feedback management, analytics and a social platform to its product, creating a full customer experience suite.

In 2006, RightNow Technologies acquired SFA company Salesnet.

In 2009, RightNow Technologies acquired social networking company HiveLive.

In 2011, the company acquired Q-go for $34 million. Q-go was founded in 1999. It specialized in semantic search service, based on natural language processing technology, providing relevant answers to queries on a companyâ€™s Internet website or corporate intranet, formulated in natural sentences or keyword input alike. It integrated automatic statistical reporting of user query behavior for businesses that want to monitor what kinds of questions their customers are asking so they can adjust content to provide the appropriate information for customers and to reduce the load on traditional customer service ports of call, such as call centers and answers by email. The technology has been implemented and deployed in a range of industries, including banking, insurance, pension, telecommunications and logistics, as well as several government agencies.


## Oracle acquisition

In October 2011, Oracle Corporation announced its intention to acquire RightNow for $1.5 billion, a deal which was completed in January 2012. With the acquisition, the name changed to Oracle Service.

In 2014, Oracle acquired LiveLOOK, real-time visual collaboration technology used for cobrowsing, screen sharing, and click-to-call; and TOA (Time of Arrival), a cloud-based field service app which became Oracle Field Service. The capabilities were integrated into the Service software in 2015, along with skills-based routing.

In May 2022, the company integrated its Unity Customer Data Platform (CDP) with Oracle Service to better support customer service agents.
