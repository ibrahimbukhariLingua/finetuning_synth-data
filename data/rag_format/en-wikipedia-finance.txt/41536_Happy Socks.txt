## Company history

Happy Socks began in April 2008, when Mikael Söderlindh, an advertising executive, and Viktor Tell, an illustrator and graphic designer, came up with the idea of colorful, printed socks. Three weeks later, production began in a Turkish factory. The socks launched at a price point of $10, and were initially sold on the company’s website. In the first year, Happy Socks' turnover was €1,000,000 (US$1,136,750). In 2016, the brand generated retail sales of $106.4 million.

In 2017, private equity firm Palamon Capital Partners acquired a majority stake in the company from Scope Growth III. At the time, they invested $81.2 million in Happy Socks stock, and Palamon invested about $4.5 million of growth capital.

As of 2018, the brand had sold more than 40 million socks worldwide. Happy Socks expanded to produce underwear and kid's socks in 2014. In 2015, the company added an athletic collection aimed at sneaker wearers and a men's dress collection. In 2017, they launched Hysteria, a fashion collection of materials such as viscose, glitter, and nylon manufactured in Portugal and Italy.
