# Lucrezia Reichlin



**Lucrezia Reichlin** FBA (born 14 August 1954) is an Italian economist who has been a professor at London Business School since 2008.

Reichlin's research focuses on forecasting, business cycle analysis and monetary policy.

After completing high school at the Liceo Tasso in Rome, Reichlin graduated in economics at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in 1980, and then got a PhD at New York University in 1986.


## Career


### Early beginnings

Back in Europe, she worked at the European University Institute in Florence. In 1988 she went to France to the Pariser Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques, where she was director of the research department. After working as a visiting professor at Columbia University in the United States from 1993 to 1994, Reichlin worked as a professor of economics at the Université libre de Bruxelles.


### European Central Bank, 2005–2008

From 2005 to 2008, Reichlin served as Director General of Research at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, under the leadership of President Jean-Claude Trichet; she was the first woman in that role.


### Return to academia

Since 2008, Reichlin has been professor of economics at London Business School. She has published articles in prestigious international journals, such as the *Review of Economic Studies* and the *Journal of Econometrics*. For the National Bureau of Economic Research she edited volumes III (2006) and VI (2009) of the "International Seminar on Macroeconomics" series published by the University of Chicago Press. She is a member of the British Academy, of the Academia Europæa and of the board of the Royal Economic Society

In addition to her academic work, Reichlin holds the role of non-executive director on numerous Boards of Directors including Messaggerie Italiane Group (Milan), Eurobank Ergasias (Athens) and Ageas (Brussels). From 2009 to 2018 she held the position of non-executive director of Unicredit Group.

On 20 September 2018 Reichlin was appointed Deputy-Chairperson of the Board of Directors of Banca Carige, representing the majority shareholder Vittorio Malacalza. She resigned three months later, in December, after the capital increase planned for the bank did not go through the shareholders' meeting due to Malacalza's abstention, which caused the necessary quorum to be lacking.

In early 2021, Reichlin was appointed by the G20 to the High Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on financing the global commons for pandemic preparedness and response, co-chaired by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Lawrence Summers.
