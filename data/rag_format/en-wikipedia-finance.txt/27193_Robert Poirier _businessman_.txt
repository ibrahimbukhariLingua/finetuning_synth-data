On November 22, 2024, the Minister of Municipal Affairs, Paul Calandra, appointed Poirier to undertake a governance review of the Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System (OMERS) to ensure that its governance model is serving the interests of plan members in a fair, equitable, and transparent manner that supports the plan's long-term financial sustainability.


## Career

Robert Poirier served as managing director of pensions, trusts and alternative investment servicing at State Street from 2006 to 2016 before joining in 2017 the board of Northern Trust Company, Canada responsible for investment servicing and management of public and corporate pensions and trusts. Previously, he held senior financial services strategy roles at Bell Canada and Bank of Montreal and as senior advisor to members of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.

Before his work in the private sector, and following a 1992 Senate of Canada rule change by members of the Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration, Poirier worked on Parliament Hill as the first policy researcher to be hired directly by members of the Senate.

Following the 1993 federal election, Poirier served as a policy researcher to members of the newly established Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons, under the leadership of Rear-Admiral Fred J. Mifflin, to review Canada's defence policy culminating in a report entitled, Security in a Changing World, tabled in both chambers on October 21, 1994.

In 1995, Poirier then served as senior advisor to members of the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce, under the chairmanship of Senator Michael Kirby, where he served until 1999, and was responsible for many bills, motions and reports including Senate Motion No. 45 where he guided the same motion in the House of Commons leading to the eventual abolition, by the then federal finance minister, Paul Martin, of the foreign content rule on deferred registered income plans and advised on Bill C-78, An Act to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board and governance provisions to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investment Board).

Since 2019, Poirier has operated his strategy and governance advisory firm, NeuState Advisory, while focusing on his board work.


## Board work

In 2009, as a result of changes to the Canada Marine Act, by the government of Stephen Harper, increasing the size of the board of directors, Poirier was appointed on the advice of the Finance Minister, Jim Flaherty, to the Toronto Port Authority which owns and operates Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. In 2015, he was elected chair of the board of directors composed of individuals appointed by all levels of government – city, provincial, and federal.

In June 2022, he received the Professional Land Economist (PLE) designation by the Association of Ontario Land Economists (AOLE).

After almost 12 years, Poirier left in 2021 due to legislative term limits, making him the longest serving board member. Prior to leaving, Poirier oversaw a process to identify a financial investor that would be interested in operating Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport under lease "to reduce PortsToronto’s overall debt position, restore and enhance liquidity; enable ongoing and future infrastructure investment; and ensure the Airport’s long-term viability." Poirier is said to have helped transform Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport into one of the most successful, community-oriented, and environmentally sustainable urban airports in North America.
