Central Bank of the Congo


# Central Bank of the Congo



The **Central Bank of the Congo** (French: *Banque Centrale du Congo*, Lingala: *Ndaku Monene ya Bokéngeli Mbongo ya Mboka Kongo*), colloquially known by its acronym **BCC**, is the central bank of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Its headquarters are located on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi in Gombe, Kinshasa, surrounded by significant institutions including the Palais de la Nation, the National Library, and several government ministries.

Established under Law No. 005/2002 of 7 May 2002, the Central Bank of the Congo operates as an independent entity with the legal capacity to engage in contracts, acquire and dispose of property, and participate in legal proceedings. Its capital is wholly owned by the Congolese state, as stipulated in Article 5 of the law. The bank's primary mandate is to define and implement the nation's monetary policy to ensure price stability, as outlined in Article 3. This responsibility includes monitoring price fluctuations in goods and services across the market.

The bank is also engaged in developing policies to promote financial inclusion and is a member of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. On 5 May 2012 the Central Bank of Congo announced it would be making specific commitments to financial inclusion under the Maya Declaration.


## History

On 13 October 1960, the newly established Democratic Republic of the Congo issued an executive order creating the *Conseil monétaire de la République Démocratique du Congo*, which took over the Congolese operations of the Banque Centrale du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi (BCCBRU). The *Conseil monétaire* evolved in 1964 into the *Banque Nationale du Congo*, the country's new central bank.

When the Congo changed its name to Zaire in 1971, the *Banque Nationale du Congo* became the *Banque du Zaïre* (Bank of Zaire). Then in 1997, when the country's name became the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the bank took its current name.


## Organization

The BCC is structured to fulfill its mandate of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the country while ensuring the stability of the general price level, as stipulated in Article 3 of its founding law. Its responsibilities encompass all core functions of a central bank, including the issuance of currency, regulation of the banking sector, management of state finances, and provision of economic advisement to the government.
