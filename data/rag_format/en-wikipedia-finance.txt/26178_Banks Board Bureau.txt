Banks Board Bureau


# Banks Board Bureau



**Banks Board Bureau (BBB)** (now replaced by Financial Services Institution Bureau since 2022) was an autonomous body of the Government of India tasked to search and select appropriate personages for the Board of Public Sector Banks, Public Sector Financial Institutions, and Public Sector Insurance Companies and recommend measures to improve Corporate Governance in these Institutions. In 2022, it was replaced by Financial Services Institutions Bureau(FSIB) with chairman and mandate remaining the same, in response to a Delhi High court order rendering BBB as incompetent.
