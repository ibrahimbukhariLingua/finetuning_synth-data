Gazelle Group


# Gazelle Group



The **Gazelle Group** (also known as **Gazelle Colleges** or **Gazelle Colleges Group**) was an association of United Kingdom further education colleges which claimed to promote entrepreneurship. It has been widely criticised for its accounting practices. To date, no one has been held accountable for the failures of the organisation. It was founded in 2011 or January 2012.

A report in *FE Week* in January 2017 reported that only six colleges remained in the group and that its executive director had left, and described the group as "on its last legs". As of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Companies House records that the Gazelle Colleges Group was a company registered in 2016 and which was "dissolved via voluntary strike-off " in 2021.
