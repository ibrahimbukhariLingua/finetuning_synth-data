The **Edgewell Personal Care Company** is an American multinational consumer products company headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut.

Edgewell also owns the Wet Ones brand of wet wipes.


## History

In February 2015, Energizer Holdings announced that it would split into two companies. The original entity, Energizer Holdings, Inc, would be converted to a personal care company and renamed Edgewell Personal Care. The household products and assets would be transferred to a new entity, Energizer SpinCo, Inc, that would then be renamed to (new) Energizer Holdings, Inc. David Hatfield, who was president and CEO of Energizer Personal Care at the time was named CEO of the Edgewell brand.

In January 2018, Edgewell announced it had entered an agreement to acquire luxury men's skincare brand Jack Black for an undisclosed sum. The deal closed in March 2018.

In May 2019, Edgewell announced it would purchase the razor company Harry's, including their female-focused Flamingo brand, for $1.37 billion. In October 2019, Edgewell announced that they were selling their diaper and cat litter disposal businesses to Le Holding Angelcare Inc. for $122.5 million.

The FTC announced on February 3, 2020 that it would seek to block Edgewell from purchasing the startup razor company Harry's on concerns of price manipulation. Edgewell announced on February 10, 2020 that it is terminating its merger agreement with Harry's after the FTC sued to block the $1.37 billion deal.

In September 2020, Edgewell announced it was acquiring the shaving products brand CREMO for an all-cash transaction of $235 million. The acquisition was completed in September 2020.

In November 2021, Edgewell announced it had acquired women's body brand Billie in an all-cash transaction at a purchase price $310 million.

In 2022 and 2023, Edgewell issued a recall of some of its Banana Boat sunscreen due to the presence of benzene, a known carcinogen.
