# Ministry of Economy and Finance (South Korea)



The **Ministry of Economy and Finance** (**MOEF**; Korean: 기획재정부; Hanja: 企劃財政部) oversees the financial policies of the South Korean government. It publishes a monthly report on the national economy, known as the "Green Book." The current minister is Choi San-mok. The headquarters is in the Sejong Government Complex in Sejong City.

According to Chapter 3 Article 19 of the Government Organisation Act, the Minister of Economy and Finance also acts as the Deputy Prime Minister, together with the Minister for Education.

MOEF has enforcement functions as well. It oversees the National Tax Tribunal and the Financial Intelligence Unit.

The ministry was formed in 1994 through the merger of the old **Economic Planning Board** (est. 1961) and **Ministry of Finance** (est. 1948).


## History

**1948**

Three years after gaining independence from Japan, the Korean government was set up and it established the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Planning Board. The Ministry of Finance took charge of designing tax, financial and monetary policies as well as managing state-owned property and exchange rates. On the other hand, the Economic Planning Board was empowered in 1961 and assumed an important mandate of designing 5 year economic development plans in addition to its usual functions such as managing the government's budget and securing foreign loans.

**1967**

The Economic Planning Board introduces the Republic of Korea's first electronic mainframe computer, an IBM 1401 system, to process data collected from the country's national census conducted the previous year.

**1994**

As the need arose for an integrated approach to implement the government's functions on economic affairs in an efficient and coherent way, the Economic Planning Board and the Ministry of Finance was merged into the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE).

**1998**

In a response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the MOFE's functions were separated and transferred to other Ministries so as to mitigate the overconcentration of decision-making authority by MOFE. Its budgetary authority was transferred to the National Budget Administration, its financial supervision authority to the Financial Supervisory Commission, and its trade negotiating authority to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

**1999**

The Planning and Budget Commission and the National Budget Administration was merged into the Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPB).

**2008**

The Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) and the Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPB) were again merged into the Ministry of Strategy and Finance (MOSF) in order to put under one roof fiscal policy functions and inter-ministerial policy coordination. On the other hand, the MOFE's authority on financial policies regarding the financial market was transferred to the Financial Services Commission. In 2018, the ministry changed its official English name to the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
