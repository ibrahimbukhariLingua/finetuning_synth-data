# Achronix



**Achronix Semiconductor Corporation** is an American fabless semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California with an additional R&D facility in Bangalore, India, and an additional sales office in Shenzhen, China. Achronix is a diversified fabless semiconductor company that sells FPGA products, embedded FPGA (eFPGA) products, system-level products and supporting design tools. Achronix was founded in 2004 in Ithaca, New York based on technology licensed from Cornell University. In 2006, Achronix moved its headquarters to Silicon Valley.

Achronix was originally self-funded by several million dollars of founder's capital. Since 2006, Achronix has been funded by a combination of venture capital funding, private equity funding and debt from traditional lenders.

In July 2021 Achronix cancelled its plans to go public through a merger with a special acquisition (SPAC) company ACE Convergence Acquisition Corp due to regulatory approval difficulties. The proposed transaction valued the company at $2.1bn.
