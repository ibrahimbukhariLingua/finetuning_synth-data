**Clara Gaymard** (née **Lejeune**; born 27 January 1960) is a French businesswoman, official and author. She co-founded RAISE, an investment fund and philanthropic group which promotes entrepreneurial growth. She was the president of GE France from 2006 to 2016 and vice-president of GE International from 2009 to 2016.


## Education

She received a degree from Sciences Po and is an alumna of the École nationale d'administration.


## Career

She served as an administrative officer to the Mayor of Paris from 1982 until 1984, when she went to study at the ENA. On graduating, she became an auditor at the court of auditors, and was appointed advisor for referendums in 1990. Thereafter she was assistant to the head of economic expansion services in Cairo (1991-1993), becoming head of the European Union office (sub-directorate of Europe) at the Directorate of External Economic Relations (DREE) in the Ministry of the Economy and Finance.

In June 1995 she was asked by Colette Codaccioni, the minister for inter-generational cohesion, to direct her office. She then joined the sub-directorate focusing on supporting SMEs and regional action at the DREE (1996-1999), then as the head delegate to SMEs (1999-2003). In 2002, the economy and finance minister, Francis Mer, refused to nominate her to lead the DREE, saying:

> Clara, vous avez neuf enfants, un mari qui fait de la politique. Je suis contre. (Clara, you have nine children, a husband in politics. I am against it)

In February she left the DREE being appointed the Goodwill ambassador for International Investment and president of the French Agency for International Investment (AFII).

In September 2006, she joined General Electric, as the CEO and President of GE France, and later, in 2008, as the President of the Region of North Western Europe. While president and CEO of GE France, Clara Gaymard was, in April 2009, appointed the vice-president of GE International in charge of government contracts (GE International for Government Sales and Strategy), then, in August 2010, as vice-president of government and cities.

In 2014, she used her expertise and strong network to argue for the acquisition of Alstom by GE. In 2015, she began an attempt to have a net increase of 1000 jobs, within GE France. She was trying to achieve this, as 10300 people were being let go world-wide and 2000 in France.

In January 2016, after 10 years at General Electric promoting French-American trade and defending industrial jobs in Europe, Gaymard was summoned before the French government to explain why 6,500 jobs were being lost against prior reassurance, and to confirm her immediate departure from the company.

Gaymard's style of management was cited as being liberal and progressive, notably her work for the LGBT community; as she supported the development of the diversity organisation, called GLBTA (*Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgenre Alliance*). She signed the *charte d’engagement LGBT* on behalf of General Electric.

In 2016 Gaymard co-founded the investment fund and philanthropic group Raise, with French businessman Gonzague de Blignières.
