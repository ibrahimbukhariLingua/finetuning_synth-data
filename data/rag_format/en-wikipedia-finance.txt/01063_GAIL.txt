# GAIL



**GAIL (India) Limited** (formerly known as **Gas Authority of India Ltd.**) is an Indian state-owned energy corporation with primary interests in the trade, transmission and production distribution of natural gas. GAIL also has interests in the exploration and production solar and wind power, telecom and telemetry services (GAILTEL) and electricity generation. GAIL was founded as the Gas Authority of India Ltd. in August 1984 under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to build, operate and maintain the HVJ Gas Pipeline. On 1 February 2013, the Indian government conferred GAIL with Maharatna status along with 14 other Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs).

GAIL owns and operates a network of around 13,722 km of natural gas pipelines and is building around 6,000 km of pipelines of its own and about 2,000 km through two joint ventures, as part of the National Gas Grid. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board has authorised GAIL to build the 1,755 km long Mumbai-Nagpur-Jharsuguda gas pipeline. In 2023, GAIL completed the world's first ship-to-ship LNG transfer.


## History

The Gas Authority of India Ltd. was incorporated in August 1984 as a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) of the Government of India under the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoP&NG) to build, operate and maintain HVJ gas pipeline. The 1,750 km long pipeline was one of the largest natural gas pipeline projects in the world and was built at a cost of ₹17 billion (US$200 million). Construction began in June 1987 and was energised by July 1989.

In November 1988, GAIL received approval to build a ₹3 billion (US$35 million) LPG extraction plant in Vijaipur with a capacity of 400,000 tpa. Phase I of the plant, with a capacity of 200,000 tpa was commissioned in 1990-91, eight months ahead of schedule. Phase II was commissioned in February 1992.

GAIL entered into a joint venture agreement with British Gas on 6 December 1994 to create Mahanagar Gas Limited to implement the Bombay City Gas Distribution project. GAIL was awarded Navratna status by the Indian government on 1 January 1997, in acknowledgement of its "excellent track record" and "potential to become a global giant" and providing it with greater autonomy. Later in 1997, GAIL began its city gas distribution pilot project in New Delhi by setting up nine compressed natural gas (CNG) stations. In 1998, GAIL entered into a joint venture with the Bharat Petroleum and the Government of Delhi to create Indraprastha Gas to implement the Delhi gas distribution network.

In March 2000, GAIL commissioned a petrochemical plant with a capacity to process 300,000 tonnes of ethylene to produce 260,000 tonnes of HDPE and LLDPE in Pata, Auraiya district in Uttar Pradesh. The plant, connected to the HVJ pipeline converts natural gas to petrochemicals. In 2016, the plant capacity was doubled to produce 400,000 tons of PE per year. In 2019, In 2018-19, the plant's capacity was doubled to 810,000 tonnes per year. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, lack of market demand caused GAIL to shutdown the plant.

GAIL commissioned the 1,269 km Jamnagar-Loni LPG pipeline. It was the world's longest LPG pipeline when commissioned and supplied 1.7 million TPA to Northern India.

To secure gas for its mainstream business, the Exploration and Production department was created. Today GAIL is a partner in the Daewoo-OVL-LED consortium in two offshore blocks in Myanmar. The bulk of its blocks is located in India, in the areas of the Gulf of Khambhat, the Assam-Arakan basin, the Mahanadi River Basin, the K-G (Krishna Godavari) basin, and the Kaveri river basin.

GAIL has diversified into petrochemicals, telecom and liquid hydrocarbons other than gas infrastructure. The company has also extended its presence in power, liquefied natural gas (LNG), regasification, city gas distribution and exploration & production through participation in equity and joint ventures. Following these additional ventures, the Gas Authority of India was renamed GAIL (India) Limited on 22 November 2002.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

GAIL (India) Limited has shown organic growth in gas transmission through the years by building a large network of trunk pipelines covering a length of around 10,700 kilometres (6,600 mi). Leveraging this, GAIL played a key role as a gas market developer in India for decades, catering primarily to major industrial sectors like power, fertilizer production, and city gas distribution. GAIL transmits more than 160 million cubic metres per of gas per day at standard conditions through its dedicated pipelines and has more than 70% market share in both gas transmission and marketing.


## Infrastructure

GAIL owns the prominent Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur cross-country pipeline, spanning 2,300 km with a capacity to handle 33.4 million cubic metres per day at standard temperatures and pressures. As of 2022, the company owns and operates more than 11,000 km of inter-provincial gas pipelines, having a presence in 22 states within India. It also owns and operates more than 2,000 kilometres of LPG pipelines in the country, spanning Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni in Uttar Pradesh. The company also owns and operates seven mega LPG recovery plants in the country today and has to its credit almost 20% of domestic LPG produced and supplied for domestic usage through its sisters PSUs like IOCL, BPCL and HPCL. GAIL is one of the major petrochemical conglomerates in the country today with India's largest gas-based petrochemicals in operation since 1999. In petrochemicals it has its own gas-based integrated petrochemical plant and also the ownership of 70% in dual fuel petrochemicals in Assam, Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and one of the major equity partners in OPal.

The company supplies gas to power plants for the generation of over 4,000 MW of power to Fertilizer plants for the production of 10 million tonnes of urea and several other industries. The regional pipelines are in Mumbai, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Assam, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. The company has established six liquefied petroleum gas processing plants, two at Vijaipur, MP, one at Waghodia, Gujarat, one at Gandhar, Gujarat, one at Auraiya, UP and one each in Lakwa, Assam and Usar, Maharashtra. These plants can produce nearly 1 million tonnes per annum of LPG. GAIL has also set up several compressor stations for boosting the gas pressure to desired levels for its customers and internal users.

GAIL also possesses a vast telecommunication network that contributes significantly to the high level of system reliability of operations, online real-time communication and monitoring higher productivity. GAIL became the first Infrastructure Provider Category II Licensee and signed the country's first Service Level Agreement for leasing bandwidth in the Delhi-Vijaipur sector in 2001, through its telecom business GAILTEL.

In 2001, GAIL commissioned the world's longest and India's first cross-state LPG transmission pipeline running from Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni in Uttar Pradesh. The total length of this LPG pipeline is 1415 km.

GAIL has started working on the Urja Ganga Gas Pipeline Project, contracted under Narendra Modi. This was earlier planned to construct between Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal for a total length of 2050 kilometres, but reconfigurations have led the pipeline to connect Varanasi to the gas grid, linking it up to the Dhamra terminal. The line, being longer than 2500 kilometres, will be constructed in three phases. Its route will connect Adani Group's five million tonne per annum Dhamra LNG import terminal in Odisha. In the first phase, a trunk pipeline from Phulpur (Allahabad) will be laid to Dobhi (Gaya) in Bihar with spur lines to Barauni and Patna. The 755-km Phase-1 project will cost Rs 3,200 crore and is planned to be completed in December 2018. GAIL already has a line up to Phulpur. It is raising the capacity of this pipeline by laying a 672-km parallel line from Vijaipur in Madhya Pradesh to Phulpur via Auriaya in Uttar Pradesh at the cost of Rs 4,300 crore. In Phase II, a 1200-km line would be laid from Dobhi to Bokaro/Ranchi in Jharkhand and Angul and Dharma in Odisha at the cost of Rs 5,565 crore. Phase III will involve laying a 583-km line to Haldia at the cost of Rs 3,425 crore.

In November 2023, GAIL successfully conducted the world's first ship-to-ship LNG transfer. The company did this to lower shipping costs and cut emissions.

### Liquid hydrocarbons

GAIL has marketing gas processing unit (GPUs) products, namely liquefied petroleum gas, propane, pentane, naphtha and by-products of polymer plant, namely MFO, propylene and hydrogenated C4 mix. LPG is being sold exclusively to PSU oil marketing companies (OMCs) while other products are sold directly to customers in the retail segment.

GAIL is India's major producer of propane, popularly known as GAIL Propane. It is an eco-friendly fuel and provides an effective way of reducing pollution and increasing productivity.

GAIL produces and markets pentane. It is primarily being used for reprocessing into iso, normal and commercial pentane used in EPS, PU, and LAB industries.

Acetone and phenol are produced from propylene by blending with benzene which is mainly used in the pharmaceutical industry.

MFO is mainly used as fuel for heating, paint spraying, and furniture polishing. Naphtha is primarily used by power, Fertilizer, steel and Petrochemical units. In power, steel units it is used as a fuel, whereas in petrochemical, chemical, and fertilizer units it is used as a feedstock.

GAIL is operating seven gas processing units (GPU) located at Vijaipur (two units), Auraiya, Vaghodia, Usar, Lakwa and Gandhar plants for the production of LPG and GCU at Pata plant for the production of polymer. In the process of production of main products, such as LPG and polymer through GPU/GCU except for the Usar, the following by-products- liquid hydrocarbons (LHC) are produced:


### LPG production and transmission

Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is the most widely used domestic and commercial fuel in India. Over the past four years, GAIL has emerged as one of the major LPG producers in the country. Around 90 per cent of the LPG is consumed in India as fuel by the household sector, while the balance is sold to industrial and commercial customers. GAIL has seven LPG Plants, two at Vijaipur and one at Waghodia, and one each in Lakwa (Assam), Auraiya (UP), Gandhar (Gujarat) and Usar (Maharashtra), producing over 1 million TPA LPG and other liquid hydrocarbons.

GAIL is the first company in India to own and operate pipelines for LPG transmission. It has a 2038-km LPG pipeline network. 1,415 km of which connects the western and northern parts of India and 623 km of the network is in the southern part of the country connecting to the Eastern Coast. The LPG transmission system can transport 3.8 million tonnes per year of LPG. LPG transmission through pipelines was 3145 TMT in the year 2013–14.

GAIL has a share of about 10% of the Indian LPG market in LPG production and 7% in LPG sales.

GAIL produces LPG through fractionation in gas processing units, known as straight-run LPG. GAIL's LPG is an eco-friendly fuel and provides a cheaper and more effective means of reducing pollution and increasing productivity.

GAIL LPG is being supplied to PSU Oil Marketing Companies namely IOCL, BPCL and HPCL ex-GPUs at Import Parity Price.


### Petrochemicals

GAIL diversified from gas marketing and transmission into the polymer business by setting up North India's first gas-based Petrochemicals complex. Even without having any prior experience in petrochemicals, GAIL commissioned the plant successfully in the year 1999. The petrochemical business is one of the core focus areas of GAIL.

GAIL owns and operates a gas-based Petrochemical Complex at PATA, District Auraiya, near Kanpur in UP (around 380 km from Delhi). GAIL has a world-class "Sclairtech" solution polymerization process licensed from M/s Nova Chemicals, Canada to produce LLDPE and HDPE, with a nameplate capacity of 210,000 million tonnes per year and has two slurry-based polymerization processes licensed from M/s Mitsui Chemicals, Japan to produce HDPE, each with a nameplate capacity of 100,000 million tonnes per year. A new world-class gas phase Unipol PE Process of M/s Univation Technology, USA, with a nameplate capacity of 400,000 million tonnes per year, has been commissioned at PATA to produce HDPE/LLDPE.

GAIL Pata is the only HDPE/LLDPE plant operating in Northern India and has a dominant market share in North India. The primary thrust markets for the polymers had been Western India, but, with the entry of GAIL in the HDPE & LLDPE market Verticals, today North India has also witnessed rapid and significant growth in the polymer downstream processing Verticals. In a successful span of about decades of establishing and marketing its grades under the brand names G-Lex and G-Lene, GAIL has augmented its nameplate capacity of HDPE and LLDPE to 410,000 MTPA by adding another dedicated HDPE downstream polymerisation unit of 100,000 MTPA.

GAIL has 70% equity in joint venture company Brahmaputra Cracker & Polymer Limited (BCPL) in Dibrugarh, Assam with a nameplate capacity of 220 KTA of HDPE & LLDPE and 60 KTA of PP. GAIL has acquired equity in OPaL's Greenfield petrochemical project at Dahej to produce 1060 KTA of HDPE & LLDPE and 340 KTA of PP.
GAIL is a co-promoter with a 17% equity stake in ONGC Petro-additions Limited (OPaL) which is implementing a green field petrochemical complex of 1.1 million tonnes per year ethylene capacity at Dahej in the state of Gujarat.

The current per capita consumption of plastics in India is about 1.8 kg compared with the world average of 17 kg. Demand and supply projections indicate a progressively increasing domestic offtake. Being the only plant outside western India, it offers easy access to polymer consumers in Northern India and parts of Central India.


### City gas distribution

GAIL is the pioneer of city gas distribution in India. GAIL took many initiatives to introduce PNG for households and CNG for the transport sector to address the rising pollution levels. Pilot projects were launched in the early 1990s in two metros Delhi and Mumbai through joint venture companies Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) and Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) leading to the start of commercial operation of city gas projects. The results of these ventures are quite visible through the improvement in air quality in these cities.

Based on the success of IGL and MGL, GAIL has further set up six more JVCs viz Bhagyanagar Gas Limited in Andhra Pradesh; Avantika Gas Limited in Madhya Pradesh; Central U P Gas Limited & Green Gas Limited in Uttar Pradesh; Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited in Pune, Maharashtra and Tripura Natural Gas Company Limited in Tripura; Bengal Gas Company Limited in West Bengal for CGD projects in various cities.

However, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas established the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) with effect from 01.10.2007, under the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act 2006, to regulate the refining, processing, storage, transportation, distribution, marketing and sale of petroleum, petroleum products and natural gas excluding production of crude oil and natural gas. The Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act-2006 provides the legal framework for the development of natural gas pipelines and city or local gas distribution networks. With the arrival of the PNGRB, the implementation of PNG in various cities is being taken up in a phased manner as and when the bids are called for by the regulator.


### Exploration and production

GAIL is participating in 10 exploration blocks, in Basins such as Mahanadi, Mumbai, Cambay, Assam-Arakan, Tripura Fold Belt, Gujarat Kutch, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery and Cauvery Palar. GAIL has a partnership in these blocks with various companies such as ONGC, OIL, GSPC, Hardy Exploration & Production, Petrogas, JOGPL, Eni and Daewoo as Operators. Out of these 10 E&P blocks, 2 blocks are overseas (A-1 and A-3 blocks in Myanmar).

## Corporate social responsibility

In terms of the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Enterprises, GAIL has allocated an annual budget of 2% of the previous year's profit after tax for CSR activities, which is effectively used for carefully chosen programmes. Socially useful programmes have been undertaken in GAIL since its inception in and around the areas adjoining its major work center's under the SCP/TSP Plan. But over the years, the scope of the CSR activities, the nature of programmes undertaken and the systems adopted for the implementation of these programmes have been streamlined and strengthened and the work under SCP/TSP came under the wider scope of CSR. Today, CSR & sustainability development is accorded high priority in the organisational ethos and attempted to be interwoven in all the business activities and the projects that are being undertaken by the company. During the year 2010–11, the company has taken up programmes of a value of approximately ₹575 million (US$6.6 million) for implementation under the seven thrust areas, which include Community Development, Infrastructure, Healthcare/Medical, Skill Development/Empowerment, Educational Aids, Environment Protection, Drinking Water/Sanitation.

For the year 2010–11 under the thrust area Community Development, programmes worth ₹157 million (US$1.8 million) are endorsed and the implementation of these projects is in progress.

GAIL (India) Ltd. extended its support for the reconstruction and renovation of numerous public utilities/buildings which improved living standards not only for a person or family but for the whole of the villages where this project was implemented. For the sustainable development of the whole community, GAIL is also supporting integrated livelihood programmes in villages, especially for small and marginal farmers. This would be considered a drop in the vast ocean but GAIL along with other Oil PSUs is contributing towards the provision of LPG connections to BPL families under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitrak Yojana. This collaborative combined effort of the Oil PSUs would be able to generate a huge wave in the ocean in the UP region. GAIL believes that for providing better tomorrow for the community where it has its working the focus should be on the future of the community i.e. children and students. So given his belief GAIL is providing vehicles for the distribution of a mid-day meal for underprivileged children of government schools to encourage young girls and boys to educate themselves for their better and more secure lives. GAIL in the minuscule of its efforts has tried to touch every aspect of life by providing Night shelters and blankets to villagers, adopting destitute tribal children of the orphanage in the tribal area, generating AIDS awareness and a behavior change communication programme for truckers of national highways and providing school bus for physically challenged students. In just two years, more than 314,000 families have benefited from the programmes under Community Development.
