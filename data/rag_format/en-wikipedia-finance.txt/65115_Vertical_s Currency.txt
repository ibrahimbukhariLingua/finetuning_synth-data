Vertical's Currency


# Vertical's Currency



***Vertical's Currency*** is the third studio album by Kip Hanrahan, released in 1984 and featuring Jack Bruce and saxophonist David Murray. It was described by *The Boston Globe* as "Hanrahans's first attempt at a pop record".


## Critical reception

*The Boston Globe* called it "an honest attempt at formulating his musical collages from jazz to Nuyorican Latin to noise rock and Haitian music within more traditional forms. It might not be revolutionary, but it's still an intelligent, well-crafted work and a cut above standard pop fare.

A 1985 *Spin* review described it as "Like tangos, like salsa, like bossa, like sambas, with Jack Bruce on vocals and David Murray on tenor. Very tropical and layered with Bruce's Celtic bop vocals and Murray's effervescent and exultant sax."
