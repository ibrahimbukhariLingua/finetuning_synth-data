# American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China



**The American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China** (**AmCham China**) is a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization it has 4,000 individual members from 900 companies operating across China. The chamber provides information, networking opportunities, business support services, and advocacy to promote a mutually beneficial bilateral business environment for the U.S. and China.

AmCham China is the only officially recognized chamber of commerce representing American businesses in mainland China. AmCham China has more than 50 industry- and issue-specific Committees. These working groups serve as a platform for the American business community and other organizations in China to foster understanding, share information, pursue common interests, promote trade and investment, and strengthen cooperation.


## History

The first American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing (then Peking) was established in 1919, with eight founding member companies, including Standard Oil. The organization disbanded when war broke out, and the chamber did not reform until 1981. AmCham China was formally registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 1991. As a non-partisan, not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting and promoting the business success of its members, AmCham China is not affiliated with any branch of government.


## Structure

AmCham China is a member-led organization rooted in the vision, hard work, and dedication of its members, many of whom are leaders within their companies and the business community. Currently, its national level operations are guided by the Chairperson, three Vice-Chairpersons, and 10 governors who comprise the organization's Board of Governors. All voting members of AmCham China are eligible to participate in an annual election to select the Board.

Since its inception, the Dinner has been attended by senior Chinese and U.S. officials, such as Vice Premier Wu Yi in 2007, Vice Premier Wang Yang in 2015, and Vice President Han Zheng in 2024, along with various U.S. Ambassadors to China. The Dinner serves as a platform for engagement between AmCham China members and government representatives, facilitating discussions on economic and trade issues.
