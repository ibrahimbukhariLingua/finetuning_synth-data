# Sinovation Ventures



**Sinovation Ventures** (Chinese: 创新工场; pinyin: *Chuàngxīn Gōngchǎng*) is a Beijing-based venture capital firm founded in 2009. The firm focuses on investing in startups that use artificial intelligence technology. It was one of the first Chinese venture capital firms to establish a presence in the United States.


## Background

Kai-Fu Lee was President of Google China from July 2005 to 4 September 2009. A few days after resigning from his post, on 7 September 2009, he announced he would be starting a $115m venture capital fund called "Innovation Works". His colleague, Hua Wang who was previously Head of Business Development in Google China joined him as a co-founder.

In 2013, an office was opened in Silicon Valley to invest in US startups.

In 2016, the firm rebranded from "Innovation Works" to "Sinovation Ventures".

In 2019, the firm closed its Silicon Valley office citing the China–United States trade war making it difficult to get into US deals.
