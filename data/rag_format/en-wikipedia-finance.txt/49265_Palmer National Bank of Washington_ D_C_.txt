# Palmer National Bank of Washington, D.C.



**The Palmer National Bank** was a bank headquartered in Washington, D.C. In 1996, it was acquired by George Mason Bankshares Inc. At that time, it had 3 branches and 1 office.

The bank's connections to the leadership of the Republican Party led to it becoming a favored financial institution for conservative political action committees during the 1980s. The bank's clientele included the National Conservative Political Action Committee and the political action committees of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Representative Jack Kemp of New York.

As part of the Iran-Contra scandal, Oliver North used the bank to funnel money to a Swiss bank account and ultimately to the Contras.
