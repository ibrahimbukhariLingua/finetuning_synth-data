Breuners Home Furnishings


# Breuners Home Furnishings



**Breuners Home Furnishings** was a chain of furniture stores in Southwestern United States for 148 years before declaring bankruptcy in 2004.

Founded in California during the California gold rush in the mid-19th century, its stores served California and Nevada before expanding to the east coast in the late 20th century. In 2004 the company declared bankruptcy, closed all its retail stores. For a time it had been a virtual brand on the Internet until it too went defunct.


## History

The store was founded in 1856 by William Robert “Bill” Breuner’s great-grandfather John Breuner (1828–1890) to cater to prospectors during the California gold rush. The first store opened in Sacramento, California, with subsequent branches in Oakland, San Francisco and later throughout California and Nevada. The company went public in 1968 under Bill Breuner. Breuner sold the company in the 1970s and it was acquired by Marshall Fields in 1983. At its height Breuners operated 40 retail outlets. The stores were large bigboxes around 140,000 square feet (13,000 m²). By the 1990s the company was based in San Diego and in 1995 expanded into the New York and New Jersey markets by acquiring Huffman Koos’ 13 stores for 36.9 million dollars. Breuners also owned Good’s Furniture stores. Private investment company Oak Point Partners acquired the remnant assets, consisting of any known and unknown assets that weren't previously administered, from the Breuners Home Furnishings Corp., et al., Bankruptcy Estates on November 13, 2012.


## Legacy
