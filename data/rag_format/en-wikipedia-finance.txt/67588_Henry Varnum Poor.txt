## Biography

Born in East Andover, Massachusetts (now Andover, Maine) to Sylvanus and Mary (Merrill) Poor,² he was the first of his family to attend college, graduating from Bowdoin in 1835. He was descended from General Enoch Poor of the Revolutionary War. He joined his uncle's law firm, being called to the bar in 1838.⁶,¹⁰ Later Henry and his brother John established a law practice in Bangor, Maine. By investing money in Maine's growing timber industry, the Poor brothers made a fortune. John Poor became a minor railway magnate in association with the European and North American Railway, and was heavily involved in the building of the Maine rail network.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
