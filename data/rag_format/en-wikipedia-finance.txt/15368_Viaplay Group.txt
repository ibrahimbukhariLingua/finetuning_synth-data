In March 2018, the Stockholm-headquartered entertainment company Modern Times Group (MTG) initiated a process to split into two companies by spinning off its Nordic Entertainment and MTG Studios business segments plus Splay Networks into a new company.

Anders Jensen, previously MTG Executive Vice President and CEO of Nordic Entertainment, was named president and CEO of NENT Group 2018. On 5 June, Jørgen Madsen Lindemann was named president and CEO of Viaplay Group.

On 5 May 2020, Pay-TV satellite platform Viasat, which was previously owned by NENT Group, merged with Canal Digital to form Allente. The merger means that NENT Group and Telenor Group owns Allente TV 50% each, but it operates on its own as an independent company. Through the merger, NENT Group's channels, including the V channels, were made available on Allente's platform. NENT Group operated Pay-TV, the Viasat satellite platform in Scandinavia and offered both in-house and third party channels.
