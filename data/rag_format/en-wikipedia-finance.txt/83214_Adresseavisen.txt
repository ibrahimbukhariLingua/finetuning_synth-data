# Adresseavisen



***Adresseavisen*** (Urban East Norwegian: [ɑˈdrɛ̀sːəɑˌviːsn̩]; commonly known as ***Adressa***) is a regional newspaper published daily, except Sundays, in Trondheim, Norway. The paper has been in circulation since 1767 and is one of the oldest newspapers in Norway after Norske Intelligenz-Seddeler which was launched in 1763.

*Adresseavisen* is owned by Polaris Media, in which Schibsted controls 29% of the shares.


## History and profile

The newspaper was first published on 3 July 1767 as *Kongelig allene privilegerede Trondheims Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger*, making it the oldest Norwegian newspaper still being published. The paper was founded as a classified advertising publication. The name of the newspaper was changed several times before its present name began to be used in 1927. Locally it is often referred to as *Adressa*. The newspaper is based in Trondheim and covers the areas of Trøndelag and Nordmøre.

Martinus Lind Nissen (1744–1795) was the founder and first editor of *Adresseavisen*. At his death, Nissen was succeeded by Mathias Conrad Peterson, a French-oriented revolutionary pioneering radical journalism in Norway. Later editors, however, have been more conservative. In Peterson's age the paper was renamed *Trondhjemske Tidender* (roughly *Trondhjem Times*) and began to look more like a modern newspaper. Changing names, owners and profile several times during the 19th century, the paper was named *Trondhjems Adresseavis* in 1890. Its first press picture was published in 1893. During the 1920s, the paper was nearly bankrupted, but it was saved by the new editor, Harald Houge Torp, who held the position from 1927 to 1941, and then from 1945 until 1969.

In 1941, during the German occupation of Norway, the occupiers took control of the paper. The editorial leadership was dismissed and some were arrested. Jacob Skylstad, a member of the Norwegian nazi party, Nasjonal Samling, was appointed as chief editor. Under nazi leadership the paper was published until the liberation of Norway in May 1945. During this period the paper was considered "less bad" than Dagsposten which was the official Nasjonal Samling publication in Trondheim. At the end of the war the dismissed editorial leadership was reappointed.

*Adresseavisen* describes itself as conservative and is part of the Adresseavisen Media Group which owns several smaller local newspapers in the Trøndelag region. It also owns and operates a local radio station, Radio-Adressa, and a local TV station, TV-Adressa (prior to 30 January 2006: TVTrøndelag). In addition, the company owns the local newspapers *Fosna-Folket*, *Hitra-Frøya*, *Levanger-Avisa*, *Sør-Trøndelag*, *Trønderbladet* and *Verdalingen*. As of 2006 Schibsted had a share of the paper (31.7%). Stocks in *Adresseavisen* are traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

*Adressavisen* became the first Norwegian newspaper to use computer technology in 1967. Its website was launched in 1996. Gunnar Flikke was editor-in-chief from 1989 to 2006. *Adresseavisen* switched from broadsheet to tabloid format on 16 September 2006.
