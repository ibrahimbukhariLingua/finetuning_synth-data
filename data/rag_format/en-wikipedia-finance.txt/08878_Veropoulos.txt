# Veropoulos



**Veropoulos** (Greek: Βερόπουλος) was a large retail group based in Greece until 2016. It held the SPAR retail franchise for Greece, with the franchise still present in the country after Spar's cooperation agreement with the Asteras Group. As a result of bankruptcy, Veropoulos was bought in 2016 by the Metro Group, which re-branded the stores soon after as My Market stores. In Crete, Veropoulos operated stores under the name of *Chalkiadakis*. Outside Greece, Veropoulos operated supermarkets in the North Macedonia as *Vero*, and in Serbia as *SuperVero*. The company was established in 1973, when the first Veropoulos supermarket opened in Athens. As of 2012, the company owned 185 stores in Greece, 10 stores in the North Macedonia and six hypermarkets in Serbia. In Greece, Veropoulos was the fourth-biggest supermarket chain in terms of market share. The firm belonged to the Veropoulos family who are also the founders of the company.
