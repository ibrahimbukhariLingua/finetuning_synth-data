## Sports team ownership


### Utah Jazz

On 28 October 2020, Smith bought a majority stake in the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from Gail Miller.

### Real Salt Lake

In January 2022, Smith and investor David Blitzer purchased Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer (MLS) and America First Field, which included affiliate Real Monarchs and Zions Bank Stadium, from Dell Loy Hansen. The pair also reestablished the Utah Royals of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in 2023, with the original team becoming the Kansas City Current in 2020.


### Utah Hockey Club

As early as 2022, Smith and his Smith Entertainment Group (SEG) discussed moving a National Hockey League (NHL) team to Salt Lake City, either via expansion or relocation. In January 2024, SEG issued a formal request for the NHL to open an expansion process, stating they were "ready to welcome the NHL" to Salt Lake City. SEG officials also said that the team could play immediately at the Delta Center, and perhaps later in a new to-be-constructed arena in the Salt Lake City area.

On 18 April 2024, Smith purchased the Arizona Coyotes assets (personnel, draft picks, roster) from Alex Meruelo for $1.2 billion. Meruelo retained the *Coyotes* brand, allowing Smith to establish a new franchise in Salt Lake City.
