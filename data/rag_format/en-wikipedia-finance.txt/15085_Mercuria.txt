**Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.** is a Cypriot-domiciled Swiss multinational commodity trading company active in a wide spectrum of global energy markets including crude oil and refined petroleum products, natural gas (including LNG), power, biodiesel, base metals and agricultural products. The company is one of the world's five largest independent energy traders and asset operators and is based in Geneva, Switzerland, with 37 additional offices worldwide. The group operates in 50 countries.

Mercuria was started in 2004 by Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, then executives at Phibro, the commodities trader sold by Citigroup to Occidental Petroleum in 2009. The company focused mostly on oil trading until 2007. Prior to this, Mercuria was assumed control of J&S Group, which was named after the Polish businessmen Gregory Jankilevitsch and Wiaczeslaw Smolokowski. They and their affiliates joined as founders of Mercuria, and they remain as shareholders today.


## Operations

Mercuria, in 2017, moved about 1.5 million barrels per day (240,000 m³/d), of crude and oil products and has upstream and downstream assets ranging from oil reserves in Argentina, Canada and the United States, to oil and products terminals in Europe and China, as well as substantial investment in the bio fuels plants in Germany and the Netherlands.

Its subsidiaries include Navitas Energy in Canada and Vesta Terminal Services in Europe, which operates port logistics, storage and processing facilities in the Netherlands, Estonia, Belgium, and Germany. Mercuria, the former owner of Vesta Terminal, entered into a joint venture with Sinopec by selling 50% of the terminals in 2013.

Mercuria is active players in energy and renewable markets through investments in the energy transition, with a particular focus on the United States and Europe. The company told Bloomberg that half of its portfolio would be in renewables in the next five years, and that it had already committed to invest over $2 billion into the energy transition.
