**TP ICAP Group plc** is a financial services firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Its stock is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.


## History

The company was founded by Derek Tullett in 1971 as a foreign exchange broker trading as Tullett & Riley. During the 1970s and 1980s, it opened a number of overseas offices and started its own computer graphical analysis company of financial futures, options and FX rates (Futrend Ltd). In 1999 the Company merged with Liberty Brokerage to create Tullett Liberty.

In early 2003, the company was bought by Collins Stewart plc, a financial services company, creating Collins Stewart Tullett plc. In October 2004, the company acquired Prebon Yamane, a broking business formed in 1990 following the merger of three leading London-based money broking businesses (Babcock & Brown, Kirkland-Whittaker and Fulton Prebon) and had adopted that name in acknowledgement of the firm's close business alliance with the Tokyo-based Yamane Group. In December 2006, the group separated into two separate entities: Collins Stewart (stockbroking) and Tullett Prebon (moneybroking). The company acquired Chapdelaine, a US broker, in January 2007 and integrated the business into its existing operations.

In September 2012, the company was asked to help the Financial Services Authority's investigation into malpractice across the City of London, with particular interest in the LIBOR interest rate fixing. In 2014, Terry Smith, chief executive of Tullett Prebon PLC, left the London-based brokerage firm to work full-time at the privately owned asset-management firm that he started in 2010. He was succeeded by John Phizackerley in September 2014. Phizackerley, who preferred to be called "Phiz", started out as a mining engineer with Anglo American and was a former Lehman Brothers and then Nomura executive. In November 2015, the company agreed to terms with ICAP (now known as NEX Group) to acquire their global hybrid voice broking and information business. Using the name of the acquired business the company changed its name from Tullett Prebon plc to TP ICAP plc on 30 December 2016. On 10 July 2018, Nicolas Breteau was appointed as group chief executive officer of TP ICAP.

On 24 March 2021, TP ICAP announced the completion of its acquisition of Liquidnet.

In March 2022, the Financial Times reported that an activist investor and hedge fund, Phase 2 Partners, was urging the board to find a buyer for the company in order to unlock shareholder value.
