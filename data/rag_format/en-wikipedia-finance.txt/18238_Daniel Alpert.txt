He was a banker and partner at Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., before founding a New York-based investment firm, Westwood Capital, in 1995. During that time, Alpert worked on international merchant banking, bankruptcy-related restructuring transactions, commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and mortgage REITs.

In 2010, Alpert was a featured commentator on the story of the financial crisis of 2007–08 in the documentary film *Inside Job*. In January 2012, he was announced as a fellow of The Century Foundation.

## Authorship

Following the financial crisis of 2007–08, Alpert became a cited author on economic policy and the credit bubble. He started writing for *Business Insider* in 2011. That same year, Alpert conceived of, and co-authored along with Nouriel Roubini, New York University Professor of Economics, and Robert Hockett, a Professor of Financial Law at Cornell University, a widely cited and debated white paper on behalf of the New America Foundation entitled *The Way Forward* that has been credited on most sides of the macroeconomic debate with providing a clear and concise explanation of the issues that gave rise to the global financial crisis. In 2013, he released *The Age of Oversupply: Confronting the Greatest Challenge to the Global Economy* on the effect of macroeconomic imbalances on advanced economies.

In 2016, he published the white paper *GLUT: The U.S. Economy and the American Worker in the Age of Oversupply* on the connection between
global imbalances and United States employment, and co-authored *The Debt Goes On: A Post-Crisis 'Progress' Report* at Cornell. Alpert was a co-author of the U.S. Private Sector Job Quality Index in 2019.
