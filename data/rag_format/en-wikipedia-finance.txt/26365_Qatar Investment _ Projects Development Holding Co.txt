## Controversy

In March 2016, Amnesty International released a report stating that in the interviews they conducted with workers refurbishing the Khalifa National Stadium in Doha "all reported human rights abuses of one kind or another," and that the "vast majority alleged they had their passports confiscated", this despite the Qatari government's promise to ensure minimum labour standards on World Cup sites. The confiscation of passports also known as the Kafala system in Qatar was abolished during the year 2021 and the country took multiple measures for its workers sector which was included in the report published by Human Rights Watch in September 2020. According to the report’s findings, Qatar introduced a new rule where migrant workers can freely change jobs without employer permission at any time during their employment, including during the probation period, as long as they notify their employers in accordance with Labor Ministry procedures within a prescribed notice period.

The contractor refurbishing the stadium is a partnership between a subsidiary of the Belgian company Besix, and the Qatari company Midmac, a QIPCO subsidiary. Midmac is also the main contractor at Al Wakrah stadium.
