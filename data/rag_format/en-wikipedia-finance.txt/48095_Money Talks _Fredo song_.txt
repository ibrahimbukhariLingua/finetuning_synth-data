# Money Talks (Fredo song)



"**Money Talks**" is a song written and performed by British rappers Fredo featuring Dave, released on January 28, 2021, by Neighbourhood Recordings and Since '93.

The song peaked at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, making it Fredo's second top-ten UK single and Dave's third.


## Composition

Robin Murray for *Clash* wrote that the track "subverts those rolling trap snares, its dub-like effects and low-end saturation conjuring feels of absence and melancholy". Jon Powell for *Revolt TV* wrote that the track "helps to show the listeners how far these talents exist above the opposition".


## Music video

The Edem Wornoo-directed music video has several references to films: the burning money in the video refers to *The Dark Knight* in which The Joker is seen burning money, as the whole video is shot in reverse, it plays homage to *TENET*, and the gambling and prostitution scenes relate to *Casino*.
