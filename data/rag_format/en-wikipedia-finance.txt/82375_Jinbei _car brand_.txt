There are other sister companies that also used or are related to the Jinbei brand: Brilliance Shineray and the listed company Shenyang Jinbei Automotive.


## History

The Jinbei brand was launched into the market in 1991, selling products with Toyota's technology.

The Jinbei brand was used and produced by listed company Shenyang Jinbei Automotive, which formed a joint venture with General Motors (GM), as well as Shenyang Jinbei Coach Manufacturing with Brilliance Auto, which later known as Shenyang Brilliance Jinbei. Shenyang Jinbei Automotive was acquired by FAW Group in 1995, but sold back to the local government of Shenyang in 2000. The joint venture, with GM, is no longer in operation.

The listed company was acquired by Brilliance Auto Group, the parent company of the listed company Brilliance Auto, in 2018.

Despite retaining the name "Jinbei", Shenyang Jinbei Automotive no longer produces automobile but automobile parts only. The Jinbei brand is mainly produced by Shenyang Brilliance Jinbei Automotive instead.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2017, Brilliance Auto and Renault announced the latter would be acquiring a 49% of the brand's owner company Shenyang Brilliance Jinbei Automotive, which was later reincorporated as Renault Brilliance Jinbei. The transaction was completed in January 2018.

Jinbei's upmarket sister brand Huasong was launched in 2014.

In 2018, Renault Brilliance Jinbei announced plans to launch up to seven light commercial vehicles and SUVs with Renault technology, under the Jinbei and Renault brands. However, in December 2021 the Renault Brilliance Jinbei Automobile JV filed for bankruptcy. This setback for the French group in China followed the failure of the JV with Dongfeng a year earlier.
