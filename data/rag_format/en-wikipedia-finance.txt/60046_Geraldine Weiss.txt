# Geraldine Weiss



**Geraldine Weiss** (March 16, 1926 – April 25, 2022) was an American editor, investment advisor, investor, and writer. She was the co-founder of the newsletter, Investment Quality Trends and was nicknamed "the Grande Dame of Dividends" and "The Dividend Detective" for her unconventional value approach investment style by focusing on a company's dividends rather than earnings.

As the co-author of *Dividends Don't Lie* and *The Dividend Connection*, Weiss popularized the theory of using dividend yield as a valuation metric by indicating that there is a strong relationship between a company's ability to pay dividends over time and the performance of the company in the stock market. Weiss is regarded as one of the most successful female investors in a traditionally male-dominated profession.


## Education and work


### Education and early inspiration

Weiss was born in San Francisco on March 16, 1926, the daughter of Sylvia, a homemaker, and Alvin Schmulowitz, a real estate agent. She attended and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1945 with a degree in Business and Finance. Weiss's early interest in investing and finance stems from Benjamin Graham's 10-point checklist and his books *Security Analysis* and *The Intelligent Investor*.


### Investment Quality Trends (1966–2002)

In 1962, Weiss began investing and attempted to find work as a stockbroker or an analyst. However, companies dismissed her request as they did not believe a female could be successful in this field. In 1966, at the age of 40, Weiss collaborated with Fred Whitmore and founded Investment Quality Trends, a newsletter. The establishment of Investment Quality Trends marked Weiss as the first woman to start an investment advisory service. Confident that she could make Investment Quality Trends successful, Weiss bought out Whitmore and managed the firm by herself. To avoid the perception held by investors that a woman could not invest successfully, Weiss signed her newsletter "G. Weiss" instead of "Geraldine Weiss" to mask her gender. The newsletter garnered significant success and created a loyal readership that generated profits off of her advice. In 1977, Weiss appeared on the popular talk show *Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser* and revealed that she was a woman. Although this came as a surprise to the readership at Investment Quality Trends, the subscribers "were making so much money that they really didn't care". Weiss garnered significant popularity throughout the years, earning herself the nickname "The Grande Dame of Dividends". The work done by Weiss has been published in illustrious finance publications including the *Los Angeles Times*, *Fortune*, *Barron's*, and *The Wall Street Journal*.


### Retirement at investment quality trends (2003–2022)

After 36 years of conducting analysis and writing for Investment Quality Trends, Weiss handed over editorial duties to Kelley Wright. However, Weiss remained involved with the overall business strategy.

She died on April 25, 2022.
