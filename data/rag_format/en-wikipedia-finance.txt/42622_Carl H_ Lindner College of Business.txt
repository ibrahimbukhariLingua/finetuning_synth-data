**Carl H. Lindner College of Business**, also referred to as "Lindner" and "Lindner College," is a college of the University of Cincinnati. The college is located in Carl H. Lindner Hall. On June 21, 2011, the college was named after Carl Henry Lindner, Jr. in honor of the contributions he has made to the university, college, and the business community.

## History

Lindner College traces its roots to 1906 when the Cincinnati College of Finance, Commerce and Accounts was established. In 1912, the University of Cincinnati Board of Trustees took over the college. In 1919, the College of Commerce was merged with the College of Engineering to form the College of Engineering Commerce. In 1946, the college resumed operation as a separate entity. Over the years several programs were added, such as a Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, a PhD program in 1966, and a Master of Science (MS) program in 1978.

In April 2017, construction went underway to create a new, modern building for Lindner College. The building is four stories tall (plus a basement) and totals around 225,000 square feet. The building also has two courtyards, which total 6,230 square feet. Some specialty features of the new building include the Kautz Attic, a space designated and designed to promote entrepreneurship for students, as well as the Johnson Investment Counsel Investment Lab, featuring a simulated trading floor and 12 Bloomberg computer terminals to be utilized by students. There is also an area for Career Services, featuring twelve interview rooms and a corporate recruitment area, helping Lindner students obtain employment. The building opened for classes in the fall of 2019, with a grand opening celebration held September 19, 2019.
