## Controversies

Groupe Savencia faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Despite international calls for companies to sever ties with Russia as part of the global effort to isolate the Russian economy, Savencia has maintained its position in the Russian market. The company, known for its dairy products, has not shown any intention of exiting Russia, a stance that has attracted significant attention, particularly from initiatives like the Leave Russia campaign.
