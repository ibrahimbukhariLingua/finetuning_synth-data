## History

Reliance Capital Limited was incorporated in 1986 at Ahmedabad in Gujarat as Reliance Capital & Finance Trust Limited. The name Reliance Capital came into effect on 5 January 1995.

In 2002, Reliance Capital Ltd shifted its registered office to Jamnagar in Gujarat before it finally moved to Mumbai in Maharashtra, in 2006.

Reliance Capital entered the capital market with a maiden public issue in 1990 and in subsequent years further tapped the capital market through rights issue and public issues. The equity shares were initially listed on the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange Mumbai. The equity shares are listed on the Stock Exchange Mumbai and the National Stock Exchange of India.

In June 2019, auditors of PwC resigned citing that they weren't allowed to carry on their audits if Reliance Capital prevented it from exercising independent judgment in making a report to the members of the company. In a recent development, the auditors revealed that the recoverables of Rs. 7083 crore were actually inter corporate deposits of other Reliance group companies that were being diverted. On the other hand, Reliance has claimed that there has been no diversion of money; zero loans and or liquidity have been provided by any lender in the PwC audited period. Reliance Capital is confident that the report of the continuing auditor will establish that there were no irregularities.
