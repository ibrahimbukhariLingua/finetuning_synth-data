## History

**Early Beginnings**

BNY Pershing, originally known as Pershing & Company, was founded on January 1, 1939, by Warren “Jack” Pershing and his partners Van Burger, Sr., Ed Cohan, Lou Froehlich and Dave Foster. The firm started with a modest capital of $200,000 and was named after Jack Pershing, the son of the famous World War I General John J. Pershing. Initially, Pershing & Company focused on providing execution services for regional financial organizations, quickly establishing a reputation for reliability and efficiency.

**Growth and Expansion**

Throughout the mid-20th century, Pershing & Company expanded its services and client base. The firm became known for its innovative approach to clearing and execution services, which helped it grow significantly. By the 1970s, Pershing had become one of the largest clearing firms in the United States, providing services to a wide range of financial institutions.

**Transition to Credit Suisse First Boston**

In 2000, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) acquired DLJ, including Pershing. This transition marked another significant chapter in Pershing’s history, as it became part of one of the world’s leading financial services firms. Despite the changes in ownership, Pershing maintained its focus on providing high-quality clearing and execution services to its clients.

**Acquisition by The Bank of New York**

In 2003, The Bank of New York (now BNY) acquired Pershing from CSFB for $2 billion. This acquisition was a strategic move for The Bank of New York, as it aimed to strengthen its position in the securities servicing industry. The acquisition made The Bank of New York the largest clearing firm for stock trades in the United States, significantly enhancing its capabilities and market presence.

**Integration into BNY**

Following the acquisition, Pershing was integrated into BNY's operations, becoming a key component of the firm’s securities servicing business. BNY, formed from the merger of The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation in 2007, is one of the world’s largest financial services firms, providing a wide range of investment management and securities services.
