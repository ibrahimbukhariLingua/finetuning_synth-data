Dirham


# Dirham



The **dirham**, **dirhem** or **drahm** is a unit of currency and of mass. It is the name of the currencies of Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and Armenia, and is the name of a currency subdivision in Jordan, Libya, Qatar and Tajikistan. It was historically a silver coin.


## Unit of mass

The dirham was a unit of mass used across North Africa, the Middle East, Persia and Ifat; later known as Adal, with varying values.

The value of Islamic dirham was 14 qirat. 10 dirham equals 7 mithqal (2.975 gm of silver).

In the late Ottoman Empire (Ottoman Turkish: درهم), the standard dirham was 3.207 g; 400 dirhem equal one oka. The Ottoman dirham was based on the Sasanian drachm (in Middle Persian: 𐭦𐭥𐭦𐭭 *drahm*), which was itself based on the Greek dram/drachma.

In Egypt in 1895, it was equivalent to 47.661 troy grains (3.088 g).

There is currently a movement within the Islamic world to revive the dirham as a unit of mass for measuring silver, although the exact value is disputed (either 3 or 2.975 grams).


## History

The word "dirham" ultimately comes from *drachma* (δραχμή), the Greek coin. The Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire lay partially in the Levant and traded with Arabia, circulating the coin there in pre-Islamic times and afterward. It was this currency which was initially adopted as a Persian word (Middle Persian *drahm* or *dram*); then near the end of the 7th century the coin became an Islamic currency bearing the name of the sovereign and a religious verse. The Arabs introduced their own coins.

The Islamic dirham was 8 daniq. The dirham was struck in many Mediterranean countries, including Al-Andalus (Moorish Spain) and the Byzantine Empire (*miliaresion*), and could be used as currency in Europe between the 10th and 12th centuries, notably in areas with Viking connections, such as Viking York and Dublin.


### Dirham in Jewish orthodox law

The *dirham* is frequently mentioned in Jewish orthodox law as a unit of weight used to measure various requirements in religious functions, such as the weight in silver specie pledged in Marriage Contracts (*Ketubbah*), the quantity of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion, etc. Jewish physician and philosopher, Maimonides, uses the Egyptian *dirham* to approximate the quantity of flour for dough-portion, writing in Mishnah *Eduyot* 1:2: "And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty *dirhams* of wheat flour, while all these dirhams are the Egyptian [*dirham*]." This view is repeated by Maran's *Shulhan Arukh* (*Hil. Hallah*, Yoreh Deah § 324:3) in the name of the Tur. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (*Eduyot* 1:2, note 18), Rabbi Yosef Qafih explains that the weight of each Egyptian *dirham* was approximately 3.333 grams, or what was the equivalent to 16 carob-grains which, when taken together, the minimum weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to approx. 1 kilo and 733 grams. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, in his *Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam* (vol. 1, pp. 288–291), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian *dirham*, saying that it weighed approx. 3.0 grams, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest's portion is 1 kilo and 560 grams. Others (e.g. Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh) say the Egyptian *dirham* weighed approx. 3.205 grams, which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 grams. Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of Bnei Barak) wrote that the traditional weight used in Yemen for each *dirham* weighed 3.20 grams for a total of 31.5 *dirhams* given as the redemption of one's firstborn son (*pidyon haben*), or 3.36 grams for the 30 *dirhams* required by the Shulhan Arukh (*Yoreh De'ah* 305:1), and which in relation to the separation of the dough-portion made for a total weight of 1 kilo and 770.72 grams.

The word *drachmon* (Hebrew: דרכמון), used in some translations of Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah, has in all places the same connotation as *dirham*.
