Deceuninck


# Deceuninck



**Deceuninck** is the name of an entrepreneurial family from West Flanders, Belgium, who founded several companies with their name. In 1985, the company went public on the Brussels stock exchange (now Euronext).

Founded in 1937, with its headquarters in Hooglede-Gits, the Deceuninck Group operates in over 90 countries and has subsidiaries across Europe, North America and Asia, including the United States, United Kingdom, Russia and Turkey. It was listed on the Brussels Stock Exchange in 1985.


## Cycling

Deceuninck currently sponsors Alpecin–Deceuninck and Fenix-Deceuninck, two Belgian UCI WorldTeam cycling teams. This includes sponsoring the mountain bike and cyclocross teams and nurturing both young talent and female cyclists. Headed by Mathieu van der Poel, the team primarily focuses on success in the spring classics. Yet, with sprinters like Jasper Philipsen, the team also aspires to capture stage wins in the Grand Tours.
From 2019-2021 they co-sponsored the Deceuninck–Quick-Step team.


## Controversies


### Operations in Russia

Deceuninck faced criticism for continuing its business operations in Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. In 2023, Deceuninck was listed in the "Leave Russia" project, which tracks companies that have not ceased their activitiesin Russia. Critics argued that by maintaining operations in Russia, Deceuninck indirectly supported the Russian economy and government during the war.
