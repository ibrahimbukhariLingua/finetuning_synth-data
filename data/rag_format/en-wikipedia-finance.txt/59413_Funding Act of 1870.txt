Funding Act of 1870


# Funding Act of 1870



The **Funding Act of 1870** (41st Congress, Sess. 2, ch. 256, 16 Stat. 272, enacted July 14, 1870) was an Act of Congress to re-fund the national debt. It allowed the exchange of high interest, short-term floating bonds bearing lower interest and terms of up to 30 years. Principal and interest of the new issues would be paid in "coin of the present standard value."


## Legislative history

The debate over the funding bill was long and intense.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The discussion focused very heavily on public virtue, national honesty, and avoiding "repudiation" on the one hand and unearned reward to speculators on the other.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Members generally agreed that an investor should finally receive no more and no less than he lent on a contract at the beginning.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
