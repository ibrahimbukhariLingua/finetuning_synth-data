### Early career

After graduating from MIT, Sonnenfeldt began his career as an associate at Goldman Sachs, from 1978 to 1979, in the Merger & Acquisitions Department and then transitioned to the Goldman Sachs Realty Corp.

In 1974, as a teenager working at the Harborside Terminal warehouse, Sonnenfeldt conceived, and then 7 years later, with his new partner, David Fromer, acquired the building complex and initiated the then-largest commercial renovation in the country They transformed the 2.4 million square foot facility in Jersey City, New Jersey into The Harborside Financial Center. They spearheaded a team of over 100 professionals working on the project.

Sonnenfeldt and his partner sold The Harborside Financial Center in 1986 for over $120 million to a major US pension fund, in what is considered to be one of the most successful real estate deals in the history of the New York metropolitan area. The Harborside Financial Center continues to operate as one of the top-performing assets in the New Jersey marketplace. At the time, the complex was believed to be the most valuable single commercial real estate asset in the state of New Jersey.

After the sale, Sonnenfeldt founded Real Estate Resources Corp, which created online databases of Real Estate information prior to the widespread use of the internet. The business was closed in 1990. In 1991, he founded Emmes & Company, a private real estate investment group based in New York City, to invest in the portfolios of distressed real estate being sold by the Federal Government, previously owned by banks the Federal Government had taken over in the savings and loan crises, peaking at that time.

TIGER 21's membership exceeded 1,000 Members as of January, 2022 and the combined net worth of those Members was approx $120 Billion.
