He finished his early education at the Military Service and School in Switzerland, then pursued economics at Institut auf dem Rosenberg, St. Gallen, Switzerland.


## Career

In 1989, Najadi began working as a public relations assistant for Klaus J. Stöhlker at Klaus J. Stöhlker AG in Zollikon, Switzerland. Later that year, he was hired as an account executive for sales of open-end mutual funds to Swiss banks by Orbitex Finanz AG in Zurich, Switzerland.

From 1993 until 2003, Najadi served as a management board member at Dresdner Bank, London and was in charge of capital markets business covering Central Europe, Central Asia, the Russian Federation, Africa and the Middle East .

After his father Hussain Najadi was assassinated in Kuala Lumpur in 2013, he claimed that the Malaysian government and president covered his father's murderers.

In 2023, Najadi filed a civil case against Pfizer in New York, alleging harm from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

On October 27, 2023, he claimed he was appointed Ambassador-at-large by the "Conseil gouvernemental de l'Etat de Savoie", which self-declared the "Independence of the State of Savoie" from France. The claim has no legal legitimacy, and the Savoie remains a department of France. As with that claim Najadis title is completely fictitious.

In 2023, he affirmed during a meeting in support of Chloé Frammery that justice had dismissed a complaint filed against Alain Berset, whom he held responsible for an illness that he contracted following his vaccination against COVID-19.
