Stock market crashes in India


# Stock market crashes in India



Since the beginning of the Bombay stock exchange, stock markets in India, particularly the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India have seen a number of booms as well as crashes.

This page lists these crashes and sharp falls in the two primary Indian stock markets, namely the BSE and NSE.
*Financial Times* terms a double-digit percentage fall in the stock markets over five minutes as a crash, while Jayadev et al. describe a stock market crash in India as a "fall in the NIFTY of more than 10% within a span of 20 days" or "difference of more than 10% between the high on a day and the low on the next trading day" or "decline in the NIFTY of more than 9% within a span of 5 days". As per the latter definition, the Nifty experienced 15 crashes during the period 2000 to 2008 with a number of them having occurred in the months of January, May and June 2008. According to SEBI, approximately 89% of individual stock traders in the equity Futures & Options (F&O) segment incurred losses during the financial year 2021–22.


## The crash of 1865

As per the *Business Standard*, India experienced its first stock market crash in 1865. Although the Bombay stock exchange had not yet been formed, Gujarati and Parsi traders often traded shares mutually at the junction of Rampart row and Meadows Street. In the preceding years, speculation about the results of the American Civil War had led to irrational increases of stocks of new Indian companies. Shares of the Back Bay reclamation (face value Rs. 5,000) touched Rs. 50,000 and those of Bank of Baroda (face value Rs. 50000000) touched Rs. 29,00,050. Money made from cotton was pumped into the stock market driving prices of stocks higher. Banks loaned money to speculators further fueling the bull run and wealthy merchants like Premchand Roychand dispensed advice that led to ordinary people placing their bets on shares.

On 16 November 1864, the governor warned civil servants not to participate in the current frenzy. New companies were floated with new share issues publicized in the newspapers. Forward contracts further promoted speculative purchases. However, the market crashed in May 1865 when the civil war ended, causing cotton prices to fall. Shares of the Backbay reclamation fell by 96% to under Rs. 2,00,000 and a number of merchants including Behramji Hormuzjee Cama went bankrupt. The crash not only led to a dwindling of the financial fortunes of many, it also led to a decrease of the city's population by 21% due to the closing down of many enterprises. On 1 July 1865, when hundreds of "time bargains" had matured (as the future contracts were then known), buyers and sellers alike defaulted leading to the burst of the bubble. A share of Bank of Bombay which had touched Rs 2,850 at the peak of the market slumped to just Rs 87 in the aftermath of the bust.


## Crash of 1982

In 1982, the bear cartel of Bengal started short selling shares targeted primarily of Reliance. Stocks around 110,0000 was short sold. The value of shares decreased significantly. The BSE was shut down for three consecutive days.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Crash of 1991

After economic liberalization in India in 1991, the stock market saw a number of cycles of booms and busts, some related to scams such as those engineered by players such as Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh, some due to global events and a few due to circular trading, rigging of prices and the irrational exuberance of investors leading to bubbles that finally burst.

## Crashes of 2008

* on 21 Jan 2008, the BSE fell by 1,408 points to 17,605 leading to one of the largest erosions in investor wealth. The BSE stopped trading for a while at 2:30 pm due to a technical snag although its circuit filter allows swings of up to 15% before stopping trading for an hour. Referred to in the media as "Black Monday", the fall was blamed by analysts at HSBC mutual fund and JP Morgan on a large variety of reasons including change in the global investment climate, fears of United States' economy going into a recession, FIIs and foreign hedge funds selling in order to reallocate their funds from risky emerging markets to stable developed markets, a cut in US interest rates, global bourses (often referred to as event related volatility), volatility in commodities markets, a combination of global and local factors ("...other emerging markets were down nearly 20% so India is playing catch-up..."), huge build-ups in derivatives positions leading to margin calls and that many IPOs had sucked out liquidity from the primary market into the secondary market. HSBC mutual funds analysts predicted further falls in the stock market, and the analysts at JP Morgan were of the opinion that market would fall a further 10–15%.
* On the next day on 22 January 2008, the Sensex again fell by 875 points to 16,729. 22 Jan 2008: The Sensex saw its biggest intra-day fall on Tuesday when it hit a low of 15,332, down 2,273 points.

* On 26 November 2008, the Sensex continue to fall, in the bargain (as per the financial newspaper Livemint) "...dashing middle class dreams". Analysts at Livemint and Ajmera associates, Anagram capital and Ace financial services ascribed a number of reasons for this, ranging from large sales by foreign institutional investors (FII), withdrawal of money by the insurance sector.

The reason given for this crash was given as a ripple effect due to fears over a slowdown in China, as the Yuan had been devalued two weeks ago leading to a fall in the currency rates of other currencies and the rapid selling of stocks in China and India. The Shanghai stock exchange too fell by 8.5%. A variety of other reasons too were given for this fall by analysts including disappointing earnings in the first quarter for many Indian companies, somber commentaries by their management leading to doubts regarding their recovery and a below average monsoon for that year.

The Sensex nosedived by 6% to 26,902 and the Nifty dropped by 541 points to 8002. These were said to be due to the demonetization drive by the Modi government. *The Hindu* was of the opinion that the weakening rupee and the US presidential election too had some bearing on the behavior of investors.

## Crash of 2024

After the 2024 general election, stocks crashed. Nifty fell from 23,263.90 on 3 June to 21,884.50 on 4 June (a crash of around 1380 points (5.93% decline) but had recovered to 24141.95 by 1 July. "Speaking on Nifty's remarkable monthly performance post-Lok Sabha elections, Sugandha Sachdeva, Founder of SS WealthStreet, said, "Nifty has posted impressive returns of over 11% one month after the election outcome, significantly surpassing gains seen in previous election years dating back to 1999. After experiencing a sharp decline on the election day, the benchmark index quickly recovered and surged to new record highs of 24401, rewarding investors with substantial returns." The primary reason for the significant market downturn was the unexpected outcome of the 2024 general election. While many anticipated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would secure over 400 seats, as suggested by exit polls, the actual results were markedly different, with the BJP winning approximately 200 seats. This discrepancy contributed to the most substantial market crash in the past four years.

However, The Indian stock market has witnessed a drastic fall since the Sensex touched an all-time high of Rs 85,978.84 on 27 September last year with large-cap stocks leading the downslide. The benchmark index has plummeted by a whopping 10,000 points, or 11.79 per cent, over the past four months, marking a stark reversal of fortunes and leaving investors shaken and grappling with substantial losses. The NSE Nifty Index has also taken a hit, falling by 12.38 per cent during the same period. Large cap stocks took the maximum hit as foreign investors sold heavily, leading to a 13.27 per cent fall in NSE large-cap index in four months.
The sell-off has been widespread, affecting large, medium, and small capital companies across the board – the NSE Mid-cap index has dropped by 13.58 per cent, NSE Nifty Next 50 has dropped by 20.99 per cent while the small-cap index has tanked by 12.80 per cent.
