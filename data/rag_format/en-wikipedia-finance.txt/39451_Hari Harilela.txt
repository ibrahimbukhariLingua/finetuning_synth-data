# Hari Harilela



**Hari Naroomal Harilela**, GBM GBS OBE JP (10 August 1922 – 29 December 2014) was a Hong Kong Indian businessman, hotelier and philanthropist and the founder and chairman of the Harilela Group. The group runs businesses ranging from hotel and real estate investment to import and export trading. He was often dubbed the richest Indian in Hong Kong.


## Background

Hari Harilela was born in Hyderabad, British India in 1922. His father Naroomal Lilaram Mirchandani (later renamed Naraindas Harilela) was the first of the family to venture to Hong Kong and Canton in search of his fortune and opened an antique shop there. Later, on receiving the news that his mother was very ill in Sindh, he rushed to India and was devastated to learn that his mother had just died upon his return. His family, without waiting for him, had already cremated her. Deeply hurt, he renounced the family name of Mirchandani and created his own surname by joining the names of his parents, Haribai and Lelaram. Thus was born the name Harilela.

Harilela moved to Canton with his mother and two brothers in 1930 to join his father, at the time his father owned various buildings and homes throughout China until repercussions of the Great Depression greatly damaged his business. The family once again found financial success selling fair-priced and high quality textile products to British soldiers during the Second World War.


## Business career

Harilela began a tailoring business in Hong Kong, opening a clothing and tailoring shop and then pioneered the idea of supplying custom-made suits by mail order. During his early life, he would act as mediator to settle disputes between Indian families. In 1959, Harilela realised the mail order boom is a temporary phase. So he diversified into real estate and moved into the hotel business, starting the Harilela Group with his brothers George and Peter in 1959.

By 2014, the group owns 19 major hotels in Hong Kong, including the Holiday Inn Golden Mile and the Intercontinental Grand Stanford, both in Kowloon, as well as various others across Asia, two in Canada and one in London. The Harilela Group of hotels in the Asia-Pacific region includes properties in Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Penang, Bangkok and Sydney.

In 2012, Harilela stepped down as chairman but remained the honorary chairman until his death. Harilela's son Aron replaced him as the group's chairman.
