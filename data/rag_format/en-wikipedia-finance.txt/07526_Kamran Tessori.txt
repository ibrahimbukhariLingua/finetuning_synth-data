**Muhammad Kamran Khan Tessori** (Urdu: کامران ٹیسوری) is a Pakistani politician and businessman, and the Governor of Sindh since October 2022. Tessori is a member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement – Pakistan party.


## Personal life

Tessori is an ethnic Muhajir, and belongs to the Tessori family, who runs an international gold business called "Tessori Gold". He is the only politician in his family.


## Political career

He established contacts with Arbab Ghulam Rahim who was the Chief Minister of Sindh at the time in order to enter politics. He was later considered a close aide to him.

The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) has put forward Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori's name as a potential candidate for the interim Prime Minister role. In a recentʷʰᵉⁿ? meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad, the MQM delegation, led by Khalid Maqbool Siddique, had a warm reception. The delegation included Tessori, Dr Farooq Sattar, and Syed Aminul Haq.


## Arrest

He was arrested in 2008 for being involved in a real estate land scam. The land which was 80 acres and a historical graveyard, was allegedly allotted to him by Arbab Ghulam Rahim who was the 27th Chief Minister of Sindh at the time to build a new housing society called **Gold City**. He escaped police custody during a shootout while he was being shifted from Karachi to Badin, which led to another case being filed against him.


## Controversies

In 2017, it was reported that a National Accountability Bureau inquiry against Tessori into a Rs172.3 million default case was still pending in court.

In 2017, a member of MQM-P Faisal Subzwari said that the party (MQM-P) was not for sale, implying that Tessori who is a wealthy businessman involved in gold & commercial real estate businesses, tried using his money to influence party decisions in order to receive a ticket in the Senate.

In 2018, Hanif Merchant, a gold trader based in Dubai, approached the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to request action against Tessori regarding his purported involvement in a gold fraud case.
