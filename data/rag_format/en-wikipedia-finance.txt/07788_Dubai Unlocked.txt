**Dubai Leaks** is a global collaborative investigative journalism project that has revealed the global elite's ownership of properties in Dubai. The project, named ***Dubai Unlocked***, is based on data that provides a detailed overview of millions of properties in Dubai and information on their ownership or use, mostly between 2020 and 2022.


## Overview

The data was obtained by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC, that conducts research on transnational crime and conflict. It was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated a six-month investigative project with reporters from 74 media outlets in 58 countries.
