## History

The Mizos had long been open to the outside world before the advent of the British in the 1870s. In former times the Mizos used to collected rubber and barter that with salt. During the Lushai expedition of 1871, a rupee would have given a fowl. The initial traders after British invasion of 1872 were Bengali Traders in Bepari Bazar near Sairang. in 1922 there were only 91 shops in all of Mizoram. There were only 2 shops in Lunglei in 1914. The Colonial state encouraged people to stop barter and encouraged monetary exchange so that it would be easier to collect household tax. The cash economy encouraged the Mizos to explore new trade routes in Kachin. The practice of shifting cultivation or jhumming started in Mizoram after they learned that their crops could earn them money, earlier agriculture was practised purely for sustenance. Wet rice cultivation was started only in 1809 at Champhai by the British Colonial rulers to boost agriculture so that they could supply rice to their soldiers without having to import them. Chief Khamliana was among the first to plant oranges, pineapples, rubber, jackfruit and guava in Mizoram.

Mizoram's cash economy also quickly expanded to labour. Mizos have a practice of voluntary labour which they do to help those in distress and people in need, the British relied on forced labour and the missionaries on child labour. Later the authorities introduced labour from the 1900s onward and wage was initially paid in the form of salt and later in terms of money. Wage labour catalysed Mizoram's economy and encouraged many to join a career in the army.


## Agriculture

Around 65% of the population of the state depended on agriculture, the sector's contribution to the GSDP was only 19.84% during the same period and that of the industry was 20.20%. The Economic Survey indicated that 32% of the cultivated area was under jhum and only 20%t of the demand for rice could be met within the state while a total of 1,428,600 tonnes of rice was lifted by the state government from outside. More than 70% of the total population is engaged in some form of agriculture. The age-old practice of *Jhum* is being discouraged by the state government with schemes like the New Land Use Policy a Policy to help farmers move away from the traditional slash-and-burn method of cultivation. Recently, Mizoram Government has entered into a new venture wherein Oil Palm and Jatropha cultivation, for biofuels is being promoted.
