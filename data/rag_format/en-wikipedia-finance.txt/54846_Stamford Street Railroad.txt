## History


### Stamford Horse Railroad Company

Starting in 1866, there had been discussions about creating a horse-drawn streetcar company to service Stamford, Connecticut. A charter for such a company was secured in 1870, but it expired before any plans could be made.

A new charter such a service was licensed in 1886, creating the Stamford Horse Railroad Company. Beginning on January 31, 1887, horse-drawn streetcars began running in Stamford.

During its early days, the Stamford Company lost money, and had numerous disputes with the Borough of Stamford.

The Stamford Horse Railroad Company went bankrupt in December 1888.


### Stamford Street Railroad Company

Following its bankruptcy, the Stamford Horse Railroad Company underwent a period of reorganization. As part of the reorganization, the company was sold, and the Connecticut General Assembly approved its use of electricity to power its cars. The Stamford Horse Railroad Company was reorganized as the Stamford Street Railroad Company in 1889. Despite its name change, the Stamford Company continued to run horse-drawn streetcars into the early 1890s.
