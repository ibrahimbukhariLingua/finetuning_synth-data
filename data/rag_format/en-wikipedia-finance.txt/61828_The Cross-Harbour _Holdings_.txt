## History

The Cross-Harbour Tunnel Company Limited was incorporated with a nominal capital of HK$10 million in 1965. The company was backed by Wheelock Marden.

CHHL owned the franchise to build and operate the Cross-Harbour Tunnel up to 1999. Thereafter, CHHL, through an associated company, operated the Cross-Harbour Tunnel under a renewable management, operation and maintenance contract with the Government of Hong Kong until 31 October 2010. From 1 November 2010, the tunnel management passed to Serco Group.

The Cross-Harbour Tunnel Company also managed the Aberdeen Tunnel in the 1990s.

On 17 May 2000, the company's name was changed from Cross-Harbour Tunnel Company to Cross-Harbour (Holdings).

In 2001, Wharf Holdings sold its 26.7 per cent stake in the company to Prestige Properties Holdings Ltd. for HK$614.1 million.

Subsequently, on 13 August 2019, Lanyon outlined a strategy for CHHL to liquidate their securities portfolio, sell the company yacht and return the surplus cash to CHHL shareholders as a special dividend. Lanyon suggested their initiatives would enable the payment of a special dividend of HK$16.80 per share (or 160% of the current share price). ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
