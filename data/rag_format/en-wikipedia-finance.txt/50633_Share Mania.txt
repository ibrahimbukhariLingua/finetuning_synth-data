## Reception

John Harrington reviewed *Share Mania* for *Games International* magazine, and gave it 3 stars out of 5, and stated that "The rules are commendably brief for what is, after all, intended to be a bright and breezy game, but there are some areas of confusion, particularly over the difference between a 'round' and a 'trading period'. As ever, common sense will resolve most issues."
