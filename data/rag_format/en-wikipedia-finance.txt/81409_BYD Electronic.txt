**BYD Electronic (International) Company Limited** is a Chinese company manufacturing handset components and assembling mobile phones for its customers, which have included Nokia and Motorola. An OEM/ODM, the company is a spin-off of BYD Co Ltd initially being a subsidiary of that company.


## History

Created as a subsidiary of BYD in 2002, it issued an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2007 having been incorporated in Hong Kong on 14 June 2007.

BYD Electronics operated several overseas factories, such as in Cluj, Romania; a factory in Komárom, Hungary that was acquired through the February 2008 purchase of Mirae Hungary Industrial Manufacturer Ltd; and a factory in Chennai, India, which was also completed in 2008. In addition, BYD Electronic has production bases in Huizhou, Tianjin, and at Baolong Industrial Park, Longgang District, Shenzhen.

As a "one-site mode supplier" especially for mobile phones, the company provides product design, manufacturing, testing, assembly and after sales services. By 2011, notable BYD Electronics customers include Nokia, Motorola, and Samsung. According to Wang Chuanfu in 2021, the company manufactures most Huawei mobile phones.

Since 2020, BYD Electronics became one of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of Apple's iPad. It also produces iPads in its factory in Vietnam, which went operational in July 2022. The Vietnamese factory is located at the Phu Ha industrial park in the Phú Thọ province. The first phase of the facility has an annual capacity of 4.32 million tablets and 50 million optical prism products. Apple's plan to produce iPads with BYD in India were cancelled due to government regulations stemming from geopolitical concerns between India and China.

In August 2023, BYD Electronics has agreed to buy several Chinese factories operated by Jabil, a U.S. manufacturer that supplies major components to Apple.

In May 2024, it was announced that BYD Electronics would be added to Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index.

In July 2024, reports emerged that BYD Electronics alongside Luxshare Precision became part of the iPhone 16 supply chain, after some production of iPhones were moved back from India to China due to quality issues.
