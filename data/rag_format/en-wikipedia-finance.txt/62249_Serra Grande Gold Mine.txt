Serra Grande Gold Mine


# Serra Grande Gold Mine



The **Serra Grande Gold Mine** is a gold mine located in Crixás in the Brazilian state of Goiás. The mine is jointly owned by AngloGold Ashanti and Kinross Gold Corporation, who share equal partnership. AngloGold Ashanti operates the mine, but revenue from the operation is evenly distributed between the two companies.

In 2008, the Brazilian operations, including the Serra Grande Gold Mine, contributed 8% to AngloGold Ashanti's overall gold production. This mine is one of two operations by AngloGold Ashanti in Brazil, with the other being the Brasil Mineração Gold Mine.


## History

Exploration work at the Serra Grande mine began in 1973, with detailed mapping and diamond drilling conducted until 1976. However, actual mining operations did not start until 1987.

In January 2003, Kinross Gold acquired a fifty percent stake in the Serra Grande mine through a merger with TVX.

Serra Grande currently comprises three underground mines: *Mina III*, *Mina Nova*, and *Palmeiras*, with Palmeiras being the most recent development. Additionally, there is an open pit located above *Mina III*.

The mine recorded one fatality in 2008 but has been fatality free in 2009.
