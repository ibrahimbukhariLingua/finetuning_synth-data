# Federation of Small Businesses



The **Federation of Small Businesses** (**FSB**) is a UK business organisation representing small and medium-sized businesses. It was formed in 1974 as the National Federation of Self Employed (NFSE). The current name for the organisation was adopted in 1991. It is registered with Companies House as The National Federation of Self Employed & Small Businesses Limited (company number 1263540).

FSB is a member-led, not-for-profit and non-party political organisation. FSB is a lobbying organisation representing small firms and the self-employed to UK, national, local and devolved government. FSB offers its members a range of benefits, such as a 24-hour legal advice line and free business banking.


## Structure

The current National Chair of FSB is Martin McTague who was appointed on 8 March 2022

Prior to 2018 FSB had 184 branches around the UK and these were grouped into 33 regions. Each branch and region has its own committee. In addition, there was a national committee which included representatives from each regional committee.

In January 2018, FSB underwent a modernisation programme and the Board of Directors altered the organisation's volunteer structure by switching from elected Branches and Regions to a new election and selection process. In 2021, the Board of Directors appointed a new scrutiny body, made up of members appointed through an independent selection process, to act as a critical friend to the Board of Directors in assessing its performance and effectiveness. The Scrutiny Body’s overall purpose is to obtain assurance on behalf of FSB members that the strategic direction of the organisation is in line with the principles and objectives set out in its Constitution.


## Lobbying

FSB claims that its past lobbying activities have contributed to changes benefiting small businesses:

* The introduction of, and periodic increases to, an Employment Allowance for small business employers: the allowance enables smaller businesses to reduce their National Insurance liability
* Fast introduction and expansion of a range of government support for small businesses and the self-employed affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (‘furlough’); the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS); business rates relief and various grants.
* The reduction or removal of Corporation Tax for small limited companies
* Creation of small business rates relief
