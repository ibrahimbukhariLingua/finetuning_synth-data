Business license


# Business license



**Business licenses** are permits issued by government agencies that allow individuals or companies to conduct business within the government's geographical jurisdiction. It is the authorization to start a business issued by the local government.
A single jurisdiction often requires multiple licenses that are issued by multiple government departments and agencies. Business licenses vary between countries, states, and local municipalities. There are often many licenses, registrations and certifications required to conduct a business in a single location.

Typically, a company's business activity and physical location (address) determines which licenses are required to operate lawfully. Other determining factors may include the number of employees and the business, such as sole proprietor or corporation. Government agencies can fine or close a business operating without the required business licenses.

### China

The business license in China has undergone a series of changes and reforms. From 1978 to the 2000s, China implemented the Reform and Opening Up Policy, which allowed for private entrepreneurship. This resulted in the creation of a registration and licensing system. During the 80s and 90s, the registration process became more formalized. Different licenses were required for various types of businesses, including state-owned, private, and foreign-invested enterprises. Despite this, the regulatory environment was fragmented during this period, with multiple licenses and permits needed to operate a business. Companies were often required to have a business license, tax registration certificate, and organization code certificate, among others.

In 2015, the Chinese State Council implemented the "Three-in-One" Reform to simplify the business registration process and streamline administration. This reform combined the business license, organization code certificate, and tax registration certificate into a single document called the "Three-in-One" business license, featuring a unique 18-digit identifier for every business called the Unified Social Credit Code. Building on the success of the "Three-in-One" reform, China combined the social insurance registration and statistical registration with the previous three in 2016-2017, resulting in a "Five-in-One" business license. These reforms significantly simplified the registration and operation procedures for businesses in China, promoting a more business-friendly environment and reducing unnecessary bureaucracy. These reforms align with China's larger goals of modernizing its business environment, fostering entrepreneurship, and attracting foreign investment.

When reviewing a Chinese company's legitimacy, their business license is a crucial document to examine. This license provides important information about the company's legal status, business scope, and other essential details. The typical Chinese business license includes 13 main components. These components are the Unified Social Credit Code, Company Name, Type of Company, Registered Address, Legal Representative, Registered Capital, Date of Establishment, Operation Period, Business Scope, Issuing Authority, Date of Issuance, Official Stamp or Seal, and License Format. The QR code on the license can be scanned with a smartphone to access the official registration details of the company. Professional services or platforms that offer Chinese company verification services can dispel doubts about licenses' authenticity or use a more thorough due diligence process.
