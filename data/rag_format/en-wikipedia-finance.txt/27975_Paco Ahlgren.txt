## Legal Issues

A federal grand jury indicted Frank Richard Ahlgren III, of Austin for filing false tax returns that underreported or did not report the sale of $4 million worth of bitcoin in which he had substantial gains on February 6, 2024. The indictment also charges that after selling some of his bitcoin to an individual in exchange for cash, Ahlgren made a series of bank deposits of the cash in amounts less than $10,000 each to avoid triggering currency transaction reporting requirements. Ahlgren faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each structuring count and three years in prison for each false return count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
