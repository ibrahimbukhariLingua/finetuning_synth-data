Hipp was born in the Choctaw areas of Oklahoma, grew up in Idabel, and is a member of the Chickasaw Nation. She graduated from University of Oklahoma in 1978, and earned her Juris Doctor from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1984. From there, Hipp spent eight years working in food and agricultural law as a commercial litigator, and four years in the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office as the agricultural and rural legal affairs advisor. Working during the 1980s farm crisis, she worked to launch state-level initiatives, and provide assistance to Oklahoma and the national agriculture sector to help curb the farm foreclosures of the time. Hipp went on to attend the University of Arkansas School of Law to earn a Master of Law in Agricultural Law in 1996.


## Career

Hipp has served in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) as National Program Leader for Farm Financial Management, Trade Adjustment Assistance, Risk Management Education, and the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. She also served as Risk Management Education Director in USDA Risk Management Agency. Under Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack (during the Obama Administration), Hipp served as a senior adviser for tribal relations. During this time, Hipp also founded the USDA's Office of Tribal Relations in the Office of the Secretary and served two terms on the Secretary's advisory Committee for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers.

In 2014, Hipp returned to the University of Arkansas as the founding director of the Indigenous Food and Agriculture Initiative and a visiting law professor. In 2018, Hipp was named the founding Executive Director of the Native American Agriculture Fund (NAAF), a private charity established with leftover funds (*cy pres* fund) from the Native American Farmer and Rancher Class Action Settlement, *Keepseagle v. Vilsack*. The *Keepseagle* case was filed in 1999 and spent 18 years in federal litigation. The case concerned discrimination against Native American farmers and ranchers in the USDA farm and ranch loan program and the servicing of loans once received. The District of Columbia's U.S. District Court approved a $760 million settlement in April 2011. After two rounds of paid claims, $380 million of the settlement remained undisbursed. NAAF was created for the unclaimed amounts, which will be distributed over a twenty year period. Their mission is "to fund the provision of business assistance, agricultural education, technical support, and advocacy services to Native American farmers and ranchers to support and promote their continued engagement in agriculture."
