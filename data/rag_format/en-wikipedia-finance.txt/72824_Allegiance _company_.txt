## History

Allegiance was founded in 2005 when the ethics compliance firm SilentWhistle merged with Allegiance Technologies (founded in 2000), a provider of online feedback tools. Adam Edmunds founded the company to provide organizations with more advanced tools for analyzing customer data in real time.

In 2009, Allegiance acquired Inquisite, a provider of online survey software. In 2012, the company raised $12 million in a Series B round of venture financing, which included investors El Dorado Ventures, Rembrandt Venture Partners, and Allegis Capital.

In December 2012, Allegiance announced its appointment of Carine Clark as President and CEO. Formerly SVP and CMO for Symantec, Clark has a long career of building successful software companies.

In November 2014, Allegiance announced it would be acquired by Maritz Holdings, Inc. and merged with Maritz Research to form a new independent company called MaritzCX. MaritzCX announced the closing of the deal on January 14, 2015.


## Products

Allegiance provided large organizations with tools for collecting and analyzing customer feedback and translating it into business insights in real-time. The company’s flagship product, the Engage platform, is a feedback management platform that generates "customer intelligence" by drawing insights from multiple channels a client organization uses to connect with customers. The Engage platform is used by several organizations with large customer feedback databases, including JetBlue and AT&T. MaritzCX still offers this platform though it's now simply referred to as the MaritzCX platform.
