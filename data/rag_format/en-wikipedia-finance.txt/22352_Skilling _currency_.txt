Skilling (currency)


# Skilling (currency)



The **skilling** (pronounced *shilling* in English) was the Scandinavian equivalent of the shilling. It was used as a subdivision of the various kinds of currencies named rigsdaler in use throughout Scandinavia, including the Danish rigsdaler, the Norwegian rigsdaler, and the Swedish riksdaler.


## Denmark

From 1625 to 1873, one Danish skilling (pronounced [ˈske̝lˀe̝ŋ]) was equivalent to 1⁄96 of a rigsdaler. The word is still used colloquially for a small but unspecified amount of money ("lille skilling"). King Christian IX abolished the rigsdaler and skilling in favor of the kroner and ører in 1873.


## Norway

From 1816, the Norwegian skilling (pronounced [ˈʂɪ̂lːɪŋ]) was equivalent to 1⁄120 of a speciedaler, and before that 1⁄120 of a rigsdaler specie, or 1⁄96 of a rigsdaler courant. It was introduced in Norway in the early 16th century and was abolished 1875.


## Sweden

During the 19th century, one Swedish skilling (pronounced [ˈɧɪ̂lːɪŋ]) was equivalent to 1⁄48 of a riksdaler. It was in use between 1776 and 1855.
