Pensioner


# Pensioner



A **pensioner** is a person who receives a pension, most commonly because of retirement from the workforce. This is a term typically used in the United Kingdom (along with **OAP**, initialism of **old-age pensioner**), Ireland and Australia where someone of pensionable age may also be referred to as an 'old age pensioner'. In the United States, the term **retiree** is more common, and in New Zealand, the term **superannuitant** is commonly used. In many countries, increasing life expectancy has led to an expansion of the numbers of pensioners, and they are a growing political force.
