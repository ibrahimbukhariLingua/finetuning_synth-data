BAS (accounting)


# BAS (accounting)



The Swedish **BAS chart of accounts** (Basic chart), represents the Swedish accounting generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and is an open to use chart of accounts for accounting in Sweden available in Swedish, English and German language texts. Very similar chart of accounts are commonly used in neighbouring countries and applicable internationally.

It was developed by the Swedish industry in the 1960s and is today owned by its own foundation. The BAS chart was reformed in the late 1990s to adapt the IFRS chart layout directives and is known then as BAS2000, but today in general as just the BAS chart.

A nested group of organisations with BAS in the center is forming a common Swedish GAAP and common routines in accounting and domestic reporting standards.


## Commonly used in Sweden

There are no Swedish legal restrictions in charts of accounts, however most parts of the society are commonly and voluntarily using the BAS services and charts.

The SIE (file format) developed with BAS in mind, is used to transport data between different accounting software in the Swedish market. It is commonly used as interfaces between accounting and audits as well for importing data from pre-systems like systems for salaries and payable. SIEs definitions do not allow anything but number digits for account numbers, not even dots (can't transfer IFRS charts). However SIE is one of the most successful standard formats for accounting data interchange. It supports a competition market of multiple compatible vendors of accounting software with interchange of data. It allowed the creation of specialized commercial standard software for functions like income tax declarations and audit importing data from accounting.

The Swedish Companies Registration Office and XBRL Sweden is however not using the BAS chart and the SIE format in the general annual business report routines they worked out together, they use an XBRL taxonomy.


## Versions

The chart is the general guideline and every user can make any amendments and personally created accounts.

The governments authorities accounting led by the Swedish National Financial Management Authority and the communes led by Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions have special versions with adding special accounts for their purpose. Some of these accounts have more than four digit numbers (the SIE specifications allow larger strings of numbers).
