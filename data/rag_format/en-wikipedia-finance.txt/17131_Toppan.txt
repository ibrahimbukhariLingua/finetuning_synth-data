## Critics

Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. faced criticism for continuing operations in Russia despite international calls to exit the market following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company not issued a public statement addressing its activities in Russia, raising ethical concerns among stakeholders. While Toppan implemented policies like an anti-corruption framework and conflict mineral procurement guidelines, its presence in Russia continues to draw scrutiny. Advocacy groups highlight the lack of transparency and accountability regarding its decisions amid the ongoing geopolitical crisis.
