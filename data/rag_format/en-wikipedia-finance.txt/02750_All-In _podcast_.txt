Nitish Pahwa wrote at *Slate* in 2023 that the podcast is "where Silicon Valley's money says what it really thinks", while also condemning the show for "falling back on shallow talking points when it comes to common bugbears—the media, 'woke' and triggered libs, anti-capitalists, tech workers aka the 'surplus elite,' criminal justice reformers".
