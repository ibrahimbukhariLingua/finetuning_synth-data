## Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina forced *CityBusiness* out of its offices on the 14th floor of Heritage Plaza, 111 Veterans Memorial Blvd., when the August 29, 2005, storm bore down on the city. The newspaper never stopped printing, despite the storm. Staff members were able to publish the paper out of the offices of The (Maryland) *Daily Record*, *CityBusiness*’ Baltimore-based sister publication. Staff members scattered across the United States filed stories to fill the paper's pages and update the Web site. While Heritage Plaza remained closed – it did not reopen until November 2005 – *CityBusiness* operated out of offices in Baton Rouge.


## Events

*New Orleans CityBusiness* hosts annual events, all coinciding with special issues of the paper. These include: Women of the Year, Best Places to Work, Health Care Heroes, Leadership in Law and Money Makers. New events include Reader Rankings and ICON Awards.
