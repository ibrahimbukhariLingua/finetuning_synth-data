## Reception

Robin D. Roberts reviewed the game for *Computer Gaming World*, and stated that "While an excellent program, the casual gamer may find his interest wane after a short time. This game is best suited for those who are interested in marketing simulations and are willing to expend the time needed to play them well."

Bob Proctor reviewed the game for *Computer Gaming World*, and stated that " what is happening and includes strategy tips. There is enough information here to qualify this game as an introductory course for Micro-economics; in fact, at a recent seminar, *Cartels & Cutthroats* was shown as an example of Computer-Assisted Instruction. Don't let that fool you; it's a great game!"
