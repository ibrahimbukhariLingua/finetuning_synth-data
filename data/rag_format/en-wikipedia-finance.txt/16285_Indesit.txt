## History

The company was founded in 1975 as **Merloni Elettrodomestici SpA** by Vittorio Merloni as a spin-off from Industrie Merloni.

In the 1980s, with other Italian companies having been taken over by foreign appliance manufacturers, Merloni became the premier domestic producer in the industry. From 1981 the company went through a period of crisis, which ended in 1984, when Vittorio Merloni, having concluded his presidency of Confindustria, returned to managing Indesit. Profits and revenues of the company grew, and this led the Merloni family to decide in 1986 in favor of the company's entry into the stock market.

In 1987, Merloni Elettrodomestici, already publicly listed, acquired Indesit (founded in Torino as **Ind**ustria **E**lettrodomestici **S**pirea **It**alia SpA, a subsidiary of Spirea srl, by Armando Campioni, Adelchi Candellero and Filippo Gatta in 1953), its biggest rival on the Italian market which also had a certain international presence, as well as 33% of Philco Italy. In 2005, Merloni Elettrodomestici was renamed Indesit Company S.p.A.

In 1988, Merloni, under the Ariston and Indesit brands, had a turnover of USD1.059 billion, becoming the fourth largest European manufacturer of home appliances. The following year, it acquired and absorbed the French company Scholtès.

In 1990, the Marcegaglia Group, a supplier of the Fabriano-based company itself, entered the capital of Merloni Elettrodomestici and took over a 7% share. In the same year the company had approximately 6,000 employees in various establishments including France, Portugal and Russia.

In 1994, Merloni had a turnover of 1,920 billion lire with a market share of 10% in Europe. The following year took over one third of the capital of Star S.p.A. (Società Trevigiana Apparecchi Riscaldamento), an Italian company of Conegliano Veneto producer of kitchen hoods, which will be fully acquired in 2002 and merged with the Company in 2003.

In 1999, through Fineldo, the holding of Merloni family, acquired Panini, manufacturer of collectible stickers.

In 2000, Indesit took over the entire capital of Philco and acquired Stinol, the first Russian producer of household appliances.
