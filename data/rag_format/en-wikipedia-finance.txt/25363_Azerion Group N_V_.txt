In 2016, Azerion broadened its scope by entering the distribution of digital goods via e-commerce with the acquisition of Voidu.

Azerion became a publicly-traded company listed on Euronext Amsterdam in February 2022 following a merger with EFIC1, an already publicly traded special-purpose acquisition company.

In 2023, Azerion co-CEO Atilla Aytekin stepped down after an investigation by the Dutch Financial Market Authority was launched, citing possible market manipulations.
