# CD Publications



**CD Publications** began as a news service firm located in Silver Spring, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C. It produces web-based news services and newsletters, whose topics of coverage include housing, health care, education, funding, aging and Native Americans.


## History

CD Publications was founded in 1961 by Ash Gerecht of Kansas City, Missouri, and his wife, Gloria. The company was originally headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland.

The first newsletter published was *Housing Affairs Letter*. It was followed by *Community Development Digest* (1965), *Housing Market Report* (1976), *Managing Housing Letter* (1978), *Housing the Elderly* (1982) and *CD Housing Register* (1983).

In 1984, the company added senior affairs to its housing-related subjects with *Aging News Alert*. In 1986, coverage was expanded to include grant-seeking with *Federal Assistance Monitor* and business in 1987 with *Minorities in Business Insider*. New topics of coverage came in late 1998 when *Youth Crime Alert* and *Workplace Discrimination Alert* were founded.

In 2001, the company began a transition from print-only publications to Web-based online news services. This project was led by veteran newsletter executive Jim Rogers, formerly of Inside Washington Publishers and Phillips Business Information, who served as the company's Assistant Publisher and Editorial Director.

During the decade in which the transition project began, several publications were folded into other publications. For example, *Minorities in Business Insider* became part of *Federal & Foundation Assistance Monitor,* as did *Youth Crime Alert* and *Workplace Discrimination Alert*. *Healthcare Disparities Report* became part of *Community Health Funding Report*, as did *Disabilities Funding Report* and *Substance Abuse Funding News*. Other CD Publications news products include: *Aging News Alert*, *Children and Youth Funding Report*, *Private Grants Alert*, *Native American Report*, and *Community Development Digest*.

In February 2011, the company's oldest publication, *Housing Affairs Letter*, celebrated its 50th anniversary.

In December 2013, the Gerecht family relinquished ownership of the company, selling it to Eli Global Research of Durham, North Carolina. Today, the company operates as CD Publications Group, a division of Eli Global. Rogers continues to serve as its managing editor.


### Acquisitions

In late 1996, LRP Publications, in Horsham, Pennsylvania, sold *Serving Elderly Clients*, which CD Publications folded into the newly launched *Senior Law Report*. In late 1999, CD Pubs bought *The Maturing Marketplace* from Silver Spring-based Business Publishers, Inc., and folded it into *Selling to Seniors*, which at the time was edited by Allison Patterson. BPI then sold *Federal Research Report* in January 2001 (according to one report), which CD Pubs added to *Federal Assistance Monitor*. The company acquired *Inside Housing* from Housing Ink, also of Silver Spring, in mid-2001 and merged it into *Housing Market Report*, the report which also gained the readership of *Construction News* when that title was bought from Evans Publishing of Portland, Oregon, in December 2004.

In the second half of 2004, CD Publications acquired *Health Grants & Contracts Weekly* from LRP Publications of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and folded it into the twice-monthly *Community Health Funding Report*. In Fall 2006, the company acquired *Native American Report* and *Native American Law Report* from Eli Research and combined them into *Native American Report*. It also acquired *Child Protection Report* from the same group.


### Sales, cancellations, internal mergers

In late 2006, *Managing Housing Letter* was merged with *Landlord Law Report* (est. 1998) to form *Landlord Law & Multi-housing Report*. Around the same time, *Child Protection Report* was folded into *Children & Youth Funding Report*, following an attempt to promote the former publication on its own.

In January 2007, *Aid For Education Report*, *Disability Funding Report* and *Substance Abuse Funding News* were converted to online-only publications in an attempt to lower costs and save them from cancellation. However, by mid year, *DFN* had been folded into *SAF* to create *Substance Abuse & Disability Services Report*, and *AFE* was folded into *Federal Assistance Monitor* (higher ed) and *Children and Youth Funding Report* (K-12). As part of the same deal in which the company acquired *NAR* and *CPR*, CD Publications sold *Homeland Security Funding Report* to Eli.

In September 2010, however, the company reprised its coverage of security-related issues with the creation of *Public Safety Funding Report*. One year later, that publication was folded into *Community Development Digest*.

Also known as CD Digest or CDD, "the national newsletter on community and economic development" reports on the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG) [1] and covers congressional legislation, agency regulations, court decisions and funding.

*CDD*'s coverage of community development projects has included transit, as in February 1999 reports on federal light-rail systems to be funded under the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. There's also a consistent emphasis on restoration efforts, of both historical and utilitarian structures.

In early 2008, *CDD* invested news space on lobbying efforts of the National Alliance of Community Economic Development Associations (NACEDA) for legislation to prevent home foreclosures, as well as attacks on the Bush Administration's proposed FY09 budget cuts to CDBG.
Over the years, *CDD* has been sourced, referenced or mentioned in numerous books and reports. These include From *Nation to States: The Small Cities Community Development Block Grant Program* (1986), *Understanding Local Economic Development* (1999), *Urban Planning in a Multicultural Society* (2000) and *Asset Building and Community Development* (2001). *CDD* finds its way into local government meetings, either as a reference source or just through the endorsement of a meeting attendee. Among those who have posted their meeting minutes, with mention of *CDD*, online are the Allegany County (NY) Planning Board (September 15, 2004) and the Warren County (NY) Board Of Supervisors (October 13, 2006). Currently, *CDD* posts updates on such issues as community planning, infrastructure financing, enterprise zones, downtown and rural development, housing rehabilitation and preservation, and neighborhood revitalization. It also provides a "roundup" of state and local development efforts in urban and rural communities.
