Outline of globalization


# Outline of globalization



The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the broad, interdisciplinary subject of globalization:

**Globalization** (or **globalisation**) – processes of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas, and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the Internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities. Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, sociocultural resources, and the natural environment.


## Global studies

Global studies – interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary academic study of globalizing forces and trends. Global studies may include the investigation of one or more aspects of globalization, but tend to concentrate on how globalizing trends are redefining the relationships between states, organizations, societies, communities, and individuals, creating new challenges that cannot be solved by nations or markets alone. Study of the factors contributing to globalization may originate in many academic concentrations, such as political science, economics, and sociology.


## History

History of globalization – generally broken-down into three periods: Archaic, Proto-globalization, and Modern.

* The Archaic period is defined as events and developments from the time of the earliest civilizations until roughly 1600.
* The period of Proto-globalization roughly spans the years between 1600 and 1800. It was largely shaped in this era by the operations of colonialism.
* The **Modern** period of globalization covers from the 19th century until the present time. Imperialism and industrialization have figured largely in shaping modern globalizing forces and trends.
