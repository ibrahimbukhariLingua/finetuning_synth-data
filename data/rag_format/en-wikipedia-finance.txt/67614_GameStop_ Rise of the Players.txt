### Critical response

The documentary holds a 79% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews.

Noel Murray at the *Los Angeles Times* felt that the film was strong from a stylistic and journalistic standpoint and that it did a great job of humanizing the players and supported a business instead of rooting for its failure.

Richard Whittaker at the *Austin Chronicle* found the documentary to be an "interesting analysis of the bubble in GameStop stock," yet he also criticized its "obnoxious enthusiasm" for not showing that the short squeeze investors are also stock market speculators that left the stock behind in a state as volatile as ever.

Josiah Teal at Film Threat stated the film was "tailor-made for a Reddit-savvy audience," and it "captures the unbridled essence of the Internet in a way gamers and meme-lords will adore."

Owen Good at Polygon stated the film introduced nine ordinary people, "who aren’t just the good guys of this story, they’re the best kinds of subjects a documentarian could want." Agreeing with the film's choice to call these nine investors “heroes,” Good believes the title fits. The senior reporter states that the real victory is the validation these investors found, not because they were proven right, but because they were willing to be wrong with all of their money, and that you can’t say the same about the big guys who lost billions of someone else’s.
