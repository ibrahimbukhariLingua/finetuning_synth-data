## Costs

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the act provided $72.535 billion in discretionary budget authority for programs funded through the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill for fiscal year 2012.


## Public perception

The act attracted public attention in April 2013 in a case involving a United Nations whistleblower. James Wasserstrom was awarded $65,000 of his $3.2 million suit after a long legal battle with the UN in which he asserted that he was not protected from retaliation. The act is notable for ending the ban on slaughtering horses for meat and its "Weldon Amendment": "a physician or other health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of health care facility” may refuse abortions, counseling, or referrals, even in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergency".

It has been questioned by the United States Postal Service, since its wording affects the service's decision whether or not to eliminate Saturday mail delivery. The act's continued appropriations assumed six-day delivery.
