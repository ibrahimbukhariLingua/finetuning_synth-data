## History

In 1999, two French pharmaceutical companies, Sanofi and Synthélabo, merged to form Sanofi-Synthélabo. Soon after the merger, the new company divested several businesses, including its animal health and nutrition business, Sanofi Santé Nutrition Animale.

This business was acquired through the first of four leveraged management buyouts (LMBO) and resulted in the establishment in 1999 of Ceva Santé Animal. Following the third LMBO, in 2007 Ceva management and employees acquired the majority shareholding in the company.

In 2014, there was a Reshaping of Ceva's capital structure to accompany the launch of the company's ambition to become the first independent player within the top 5 global animal health companies by 2020. While management still retained the position of majority shareholders long-term strategic partners were selected to support the group's future growth ambitions:Temasek, CDH Investments, Euromezzanine, Sagard and Mérieux Développement.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Business with blood farms

Ceva has funded several studies about the equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) effects on livestock productivity, including one at École nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort, 2001. According to an investigation published in French journal *Libération*, CEVA bought the eCG in Syntex bloodfarms, accused of cruelty to animals by NGOs Eyes on Animals (Netherlands), Tierschutzbund Zurich (TSB – Switzerland ), Animal Welfare Foundation (AWF – Germany) and Welfarm (France), among others.

Pierre Revel-Mouroz, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of the audit at Ceva Santé Animale, alerted in 2015, justified this choice by "the absence of detection of anomalies in the farm where the laboratory gets supplies". According to *Libération*, Ceva continued to supply from Syntex mid-July 2018, despite repeated warnings: the article denounces this "inertia". On July 25, 2018, Ceva announced an investigation to verify the quality of life of the concerned mares. On August 3, 2018, the laboratory indicates (on its website) to renounce to provide in South America. On 16 December 2018, the collectif Boucherie Abolition published an article accusing the multinational CEVA of "zoocide".

The concerned products are marketed as "Fertipig" for pigs, and "Syncro Part" or "Syncrostim" for cattle.
