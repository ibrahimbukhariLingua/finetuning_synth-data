## History

The history of Antai College is linked to that of its parent: Shanghai Jiao Tong University. This university was founded in 1896 as Nanyang Public School by an imperial edict issued by the Guangxu Emperor, under the Business and Telegraphs Office of the imperial government. In 1918, the name of the post-revolution university was changed to Nan Yan College of Chiao Tung and the school started specializing in transportation and communication.

In the same year, the Railway Management Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University was established. In 1984, the reestablishment of the name Management School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University was approved by the Ministry of Education. In 1996, Aetna International Group of the USA invested in the Management School, allowing it to grow to an influential regional institution. Finally in 2000, the school changed its name to Antai College of Economics and Management. Entering the 21st century, large investments allowed the school to expand its educational offering, extend its international reach and invest in state-of-the art facilities in downtown Shanghai.
