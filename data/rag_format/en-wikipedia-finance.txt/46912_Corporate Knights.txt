Corporate Knights


# Corporate Knights



**Corporate Knights** is a media and research company based in Toronto, Canada, focused on advancing a sustainable economy. The company publishes a magazine, *Corporate Knights*, and produces global rankings, research reports, and financial product ratings based on corporate and environmental sustainability performance, including the "Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World" and the "Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada".


## History

Corporate Knights Inc. was co-founded in 2002 by Toby A. Heaps, Paul Fengler and Peter Diplaros. According to Heaps, the trio created the magazine as a "halfway house between Adbusters and Forbes." The magazine was first published in the wake of the accounting scandal at Enron and WorldCom with the objective of holding companies more accountable. The three founders believed that "if you want to make social change, it's through business." Heaps later coined the term "clean capitalism".

Corporate Knights looks to highlight regional and national opportunities for the clean energy transition by acting as an advisor to corporations, governments and people working toward a more sustainable economy.


## Organization


### Corporate Knights media

*Corporate Knights* is published quarterly and maintains an editorial focus on climate change, responsible investing, and the ideas, actions and innovations that shape a sustainable economy. It is distributed in *The Globe and Mail*, *The Washington Post*, and *The Wall Street Journal*. In 2012, *Corporate Knights* was named "Magazine of the Year" by the National Media Awards Foundation.

In 2019, following the publication of "The high cost of low corporate taxes" by Marco Chown Oved, Toby Heaps, and Michael Yow, *Corporate Knights* was awarded the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (SABEW) Canada Silver Award for Investigative Reporting.


### Corporate Knights research

The Corporate Knights research division produces global sustainability rankings, research reports and financial product ratings based on corporate sustainability performance. Corporate Knights publishes upwards of 10 annual rankings, including the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World, released each year in Davos during the World Economic Forum, and the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada.

Since 2005, the Global 100 has looked to emphasize the impact of a company's core products and services. It is the best-performing global sustainability index (CKG100), with more than 10 years of history. Gartner's Market Guide for Corporate ESG Ratings and Research (June 2022) stated that among the main ESG research data providers, "Corporate Knights is the only provider to track the 'clean CapEx', clean R&D', and 'clean acquisitions' against a common taxonomy."

Corporate Knights also acts as a research partner to the Sustainable Markets Initiative for the Terra Carta Seal , awarded to global companies that are leaders on sustainability and have credible net-zero plans, that was launched in 2021 by HRH The Prince of Wales at COP26 in Glasgow.

Corporate Knights rankings are regularly cited in leading business publications, including *Fast Company*, *The Financial Times*, and *Forbes*.
