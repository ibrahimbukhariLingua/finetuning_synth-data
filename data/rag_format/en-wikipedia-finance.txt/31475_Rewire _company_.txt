## History

Remitly Israel was originally the startup company Rewire which was founded in Israel in 2015 by Guy Kashtan, Saar Yahalom, Adi Ben Dayan, and Or Benoz in response to the growing demand for affordable and accessible financial services of the local foreign worker population. Initially it served the thousands of Filipinos working in Israel as domestic caregivers for the elderly and expanded its services to additional migrant populations looking to send money to India, Thailand, and China to name a few. Initial investors included Israeli-based groups such as Our Crowd, Viola Fintech and Moneta VC. Additional initial investors included BNP Paribas (Opera Tech) and Standard Bank of South Africa.

In 2021, the company announced that it had completed a series B funding round of $20 million and also a collaboration with Israel's Bank Hapoalim. New investors joined this round of funding such as Renegade Partners, Glilot Capital Partners, and Jerry Yang, former Yahoo! CEO and director at Alibaba, through AME Cloud Ventures. At the same time, the company announced it had secured an EU Electronic Money Institution license (EMI), granted by the Dutch Central Bank, which allows the fintech startup to (I) issue electronic money, (II) provide payment services, and (III) engage in money remittance. Rewire was also granted an expanded Israeli Financial Asset Service Provider.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
