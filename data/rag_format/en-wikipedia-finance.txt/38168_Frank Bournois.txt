## Executive governance and top management teams

Frank Bournois developed an early interest for the nature of managerial and top leadership work. He led several research programmes including comparative HR management across Europe (1988–1997), business intelligence (1997–2001) and corporate governance (2001–2010). Cegetel, a leading telecoms company, supported the ESCP Business School Chair of Corporate Governance. Academics and business leaders convened to analyze the subtleties of the dynamics of executive committees. The concept of executive governance (*dirigeance* in French) was elaborated during that period.

He is a regular speaker on the topic of benchmarking large European companies, prospective screening of management changes, the prevention of career derailment for leaders and generally what makes organisations and management committees effective or dysfunctional.

In 2012, Ezra Suleiman (Princeton University), Yasmina Jaidi and Frank Bournois (Université Panthéon Assas Paris II) conducted a large survey on « *French Management as Experienced by Non-French Managers* ». The survey results highlight that French management is very specific. The key features of French management are investigated and analyzed using the 3,000+ responses (June 2014) that were gleaned from non French managers working in French CAC 40 companies. Results show what makes French management attractive (creativity, flexibility, using networks effectively,...) and also expectations about what may be improved (e.g. less centralisation, less hierarchy, less implicitness ,...). This research led to the publication of a book by the three authors, *La Prouesse française*.
