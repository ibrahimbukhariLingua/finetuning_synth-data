In Singapore, only public companies must hold AGMs. With effect from 31 August 2018, private limited companies can decide whether they want AGMs or not. Private companies can be exempted from holding AGMs if they send their financial statements to their members within five months after the financial year end (FYE).

To dispense with AGMs, company members need to pass a resolution. All the shareholders must endorse the document for it to come into force. Having dispensed with AGMs, companies pass written resolutions on matters that would otherwise be discussed at AGMs.

The resolution putting an end to AGMs may cease to be in force – members can adopt a new resolution to revoke the dispensation. In this case, an AGM must be held if at least three months remain to its due date.

If a private company decides to have AGMs, it must adhere to the deadlines. The annual general meeting must be held within six months after the FYE. Next, every company must lodge the obligatory annual return within one month after its AGM.
