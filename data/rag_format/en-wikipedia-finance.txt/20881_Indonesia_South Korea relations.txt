Indonesia and South Korea have invested in multiple joint military development projects, including the KFX/IFX fighter jet. South Korean firm Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) is in final contract negotiations to supply Indonesia with three Type-209 submarines. This will be the largest ever bilateral defense deal, valued at US$1.1 billion.

In 2012, there were about 38,000 Indonesian citizens living in South Korea.

Today the cooperation has been expanded to a number of mega projects and advanced industries. With US$27 billion in bilateral trade, South Korea became the fourth biggest trading partner of Indonesia in 2012. It became the third-biggest foreign investor in Indonesia, with US$1.94 billion in investment.

There are large numbers of South Korean companies that have been investing and operating in Indonesia, such as Miwon (Daesang Corporation), Lotte, Yong Ma, Hankook, Samsung, LG, Kia and Hyundai. In 2011, Hankook announced a US$353 million investment into a production plant located in Bekasi, West Java, Indonesia.

In 2019, trade between Indonesia and South Korea was worth $15.65 billion, and between 2015 and 2019 South Korean companies invested nearly $7 billion in Indonesia. In December 2020, Indonesia and South Korea signed the Indonesia–Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. It is equivalent to a free trade agreement, though focuses on a broader scope of economic cooperation. Under the deal, Indonesia will scrap 94.8% of tariffs on South Korean products while South Korea will scrap 95.8% of tariffs on Indonesian products.
In May 2023, the central banks of South Korea and Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding to promote bilateral trade in national currencies, moving away from the US dollar as an intermediary. They said in a joint statement that the step is expected to help South Korean and Indonesian corporations to lower transaction costs and exposure to exchange rate risks.

Korea and Indonesia have been engaged in a variety of public diplomacy, with exchanges between local governments being the first. Local government public diplomacy, which began in 1961, increased rapidly in the 2000s, centered on friendly exchange projects, and entered a maturity period through the Park Geun Hyen government, which established customized public diplomacy projects there, the Moon Jae Inn government, which enacted the Public Diplomacy Act, and the Moon Jae Inn government, which sought to harmonize autonomy and international cooperation.

Korean companies' investment and expansion in Indonesia also began in the 1960s, and it is encouraging that more Korean companies are gradually fulfilling their responsibilities as members of Indonesian society, free from the economic motives of cost reduction and market development. However, it is necessary to investigate how much Korean companies can respond to sensitive issues such as climate change and carbon neutrality that the Indonesian government is interested in.
