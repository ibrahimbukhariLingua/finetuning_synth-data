## Key Subsidiaries

**YTL Power Generation Sdn Bhd - Malaysia**

In 1992, YTL Power started as the first Independent Power Producer (IPP) in Malaysia by securing a 21-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the government for the development of a 1,212MW combined cycle power plant at Paka, Terengganu, and Pasir Gudang, Johor. The development of the combined cycle power plant was financed through a ringgit denominated currency, facilitated by the first 15-year long term bond issued by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). This financing successfully mitigated the influence of the Asian Financial Crisis at that time.

The construction and the commissioning of the first open-cycle plant was completed in a world-record time of 10 months, while the gas-fired combined cycle plant was completed in 22 months. Subsequently in September 2017, the Paka power plant was awarded a supplementary PPA for a further period of 3 years and 10 months.

**ElectraNet Pty Ltd – Australia**

In 2000, YTL Power made its first significant foreign investment by acquiring a 33.5% equity interest in ElectraNet Pty Ltd (ElectraNet) for AUD 58.5 million (approximately RM 122.9 million). ElectraNet is an electricity transmission company in South Australia serving regional transmission under a 200-year lease. ElectraNet transmits power over long distances from regional generators and interstate sources to metropolitan and regional areas including large, direct-connect industrial customers.

In 2022, YTL Power divested its stake in ElectraNet to Australian Utilities Pty Ltd for a consideration of approximately RM 3.07 billion, generating RM 2.2 billion in gains upon completion of the transaction.

**Wessex Water Limited – United Kingdom**

In 2002, YTL Power acquired 100% of Wessex Water Limited (Wessex Water) from Enron. Wessex Water is a regional water and sewerage service company that serves 2.9 million customers across a geographic area of approximately 10,000 square kilometres in the southwest of England, including Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, most of Wiltshire and parts of Gloucestershire and Hampshire.

Wessex Water is regulated by the Water Services Regulation Authority (known as Ofwat), the economic regulator for the UK water industry, and holds a license from the UK government under an instrument of appointment to supply clean water and treat and dispose of wastewater from its operating region. When it was first acquired by YTL Power in 2002, the regulatory capital value of Wessex Water is £1.3 billion. As of 30 June 2023, the regulatory capital value was at £4.1 billion (approximately RM 24.4 billion).

Additionally, Wessex Water was rated as the top-performing water and sewerage company in the latest UK Customer Service Index 2023 by the Institute of Customer Service and retained the National Customer Service Excellent (CSE) quality mark certificate in 2023. As a result, Wessex Water’s outstanding performance has led it to become one of only six companies in the UK to have been a three-time winner of the Queen’s Award for Enterprise in Sustainable Development.

**YTL PowerSeraya Pte Limited - Singapore**

On 6 March 2009, YTL Power acquired 100% equity interest in YTL PowerSeraya Pte Ltd (YTL PowerSeraya) from Temasek Holdings.

The original purchase consideration of SGD 331.45 million, which was to be settled via a combination of cash, shares and shareholder loans in the holding company of YTL PowerSeraya was subsequently restructured to a purely cash deal of SGD 270.0 million. The transaction was completed in June 2022. The plants operated under YTL PowerSeraya contribute more than 30% of Singapore’s total electricity needs.

In 2023, YTL PowerSeraya collaborated with TNB Power Generation Sdn Bhd for the export and import of 100MW of electricity to Singapore via a newly upgraded interconnector. In January 2024, YTL PowerSeraya won the first request for proposal (RFP) for the development of a 600MW hydrogen-ready CCGT under Singapore’s Energy Market Authority’s new centralised process and it is expected to be completed by 31 December 2027.

The Samsung 4G Chromebook was co-developed exclusively by Yes, Samsung and Google to integrate a 4G module that worked seamlessly with Yes’ 4G network which had already covered 85% of the country across over 4,000 base stations. Sundar Pichai noted that the “pace at which 4G connectivity is being rolled out throughout the country and what’s happening in Malaysia can be a role model for many other countries around the world.”
