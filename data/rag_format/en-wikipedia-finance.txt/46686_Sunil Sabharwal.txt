## Early life and education

He was born in 1964 in New Delhi, India to Baldev Raj Sabharwal, a printing entrepreneur who founded the New Roxy Press in New Delhi, and Gabriella de Bessenyey, of Hungarian descent. The de Bessenyey clan is one of the oldest Hungarian noble families, tracing its lineage back to at least the 14th century, with documentary evidence of it being given a right to a coat of arms by the monarch from the 15th century. On occasion, literature refers to Sunil as Sabharwal de Bessenyey. He attended the Frank Anthony School in New Delhi, India and the Dob Utca Elementary School and Imre Madach High School in Budapest, Hungary.

Sabharwal's mother struggled in Hungary under the communist regime because she refused to join the communist party. When she tried to sell pottery to feed her family, authorities would not grant her a vendor's license. The family went to Vienna during the summer of 1983 under the auspices of a cultural tour and pleaded for asylum at the US Embassy, citing political and religious oppression. They gained sponsorship from the Upper Arlington Lutheran Church in Columbus, Ohio, with particular support from Ohio State University (OSU) Professor of Finance David Cole and his wife Edie, and arrived in Columbus in December 1983. Once in the Columbus Hungarian-American network, Sabharwal met OSU fencing coach and Hungarian Charlotte Remenyik.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
