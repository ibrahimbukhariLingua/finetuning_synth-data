## History

Linkurious was founded in 2013 by Sébastien Heymann, David Rapin and Jean Villedieu following the development of Gephi, which was inspired by the prototype for Stanford's Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis project *Mapping the Republic of Letters* and looked at connections across thousands of communities in Europe and North America during The Enlightenment.

In 2023, Linkurious is listed in the TOP 250 French software companies and receives the "International" award of the Year granted by Ernst & Young and Numeum.


## Products

Linkurious technology provides case management capabilities as well as detection, data search, visualization and exploration capabilities for various graph databases such as Neo4j, Azure Cosmos DB, Memgraph, TitanDB, DataStax, AllegroGraph and RedisGraph.

Linkurious has developed a Javascript graph visualization library named Ogma. It provides a graphics engine based on WebGL and supports older machines with HTML5 Canvas.

Linkurious' graph visualization tool is used for NASA's Lessons Learned database, identifying connections between seemingly unlikely subjects, such as a correlation between contaminated fluid and battery fire risk.
