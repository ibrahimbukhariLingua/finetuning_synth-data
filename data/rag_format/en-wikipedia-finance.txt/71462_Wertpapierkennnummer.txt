Wertpapierkennnummer


# Wertpapierkennnummer



The **Wertpapierkennnummer** (WKN, WPKN, WPK or *Wert*) is a German securities identification code. It is composed of six digits or capital letters (excluding I and O), and no check digit.


## Changes in format

There have been several changes in the WKN definition:

* WKN were switched from numeric to alphanumeric on 21 July 2003
* The first 2–4 Letters may show the issuer of the Instrument.
* Until March 2000, the WKNs were divided into different number ranges that represented different types of securities (e.g., stocks, warrants, funds, etc.).

The WKNs and DE-ISINs are provided by WM-Datenservice.

WKNs may be obsolete in future, since they may be replaced by International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs).


## Spelling and meaning

Like most very long German words, *Wertpapierke**nnn**ummer* is a compound word: Wert-Papier-Kenn-Nummer, if translated literally, means value–paper–identification–number (Wertpapier = financial security; Kennnummer = identification number).

Before the German spelling reform of 1996 the correct spelling was *Wertpapierke**nn**ummer* with only two consecutive *n*'s, since the orthography rules allowed the same consonant three times in a row only under special circumstances. Since the reform, the spelling has been *Wertpapierke**nnn**ummer* with three consecutive *n*’s.
