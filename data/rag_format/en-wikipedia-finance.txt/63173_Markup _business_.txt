Markup (business)


# Markup (business)



**Markup** (or **price spread**) is the difference between the selling price of a good or service and its cost. It is often expressed as a percentage over the cost. A markup is added into the total cost incurred by the producer of a good or service in order to cover the costs of doing business and create a profit. The total cost reflects the total amount of both fixed and variable expenses to produce and distribute a product. Markup can be expressed as the fixed amount or as a percentage of the total cost or selling price. Retail markup is commonly calculated as the difference between wholesale price and retail price, as a percentage of wholesale. Other methods are also used.


## Price determination


### Profit

* Assume: Sale price is 2500, Product cost is 1800

### Markup

Below shows markup as a percentage of the cost added to the cost to create a new total (i.e. cost plus).

* Cost × (1 + Markup) = Sale price

* Assume the sale price is $1.99 and the cost is $1.40

* To convert from markup to profit margin:

A different method of calculating markup is based on percentage of selling price. This method eliminates the two-step process above and incorporates the ability of discount pricing.

* For instance cost of an item is 75.00 with 25% markup discount.

Comparing the two methods for discounting:

* 75.00 × (1 + .25) = 93.75 sale price with a 25% discount

* 75.00 /(1 − .25) = 100.00 sale price with a 25% discount

These examples show the difference between adding a percentage of a number to a number and asking of what number is this number X% of. If the markup has to include more than just profit, such as overhead, it can be included as such:

* cost × 1.25 = sale price

or

* cost / .75 = sale price

### Aggregate supply framework

P = (1+μ) W. Where μ is the markup over costs. This is the pricing equation.

W = F(u,z) Pe . This is the wage setting relation. u is unemployment which negatively affects wages and z the catch all variable positively affects wages.

P = Pe(1+μ) F(u,z). This is the aggregate supply curve. Where the price is determined by expected price, unemployment and z the catch all variable.
