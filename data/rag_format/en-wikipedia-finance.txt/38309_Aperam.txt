Aperam


# Aperam



**Aperam S.A.** is a company listed on the Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Madrid and Luxembourg stock exchanges and with facilities in Brazil, Belgium and France, which concentrates on the production of stainless steel and speciality steel. It was spun out of ArcelorMittal at the start of 2011; the facilities that became Aperam had about 27% by turnover of the stainless-steel market as of 2009.

The Brazilian facility uses charcoal from a series of eucalyptus forests owned and managed by the group rather than coking coal to reduce the material; the European facilities use electric-arc furnaces fed with scrap. The use of charcoal reduces the CO₂ footprint of the facility.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
