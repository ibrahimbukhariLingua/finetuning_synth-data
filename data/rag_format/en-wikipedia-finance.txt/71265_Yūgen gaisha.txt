Yūgen gaisha


# Yūgen gaisha



A ***yūgen gaisha*** (有限会社, "limited company"), abbreviated in English as "Y.K." or "Co., Ltd.", was a form of business organization in Japan.

*Yūgen gaisha* were based on the German *Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung* and were implemented in Japan in the Limited Company Act (有限会社法, *Yūgen gaisha hō*) of 1940. The Companies Act of Japan, implemented on May 1, 2006, replaced the *yūgen gaisha* with a new form of company called *gōdō gaisha*, based upon the American limited liability company. Following the implementation, no new YKs were allowed in Japan, but pre-existing YKs were allowed to continue their operations as *kabushiki gaisha* under special rules.

Whether the term is pronounced as *yūgen gaisha* or *yūgen kaisha* is up to the local dialect or the company's preference when it is part of the company's name. While it is pronounced *yūgen gaisha* in standard Japanese, the alphabetic abbreviation is always Y.K. by standard.


## Structure

As of 2005, a Y.K. can have up to 50 investors, called members (社員, *shain*). The members were required to provide at least ¥3 million in capital contributions, with each investment unit (持分, *mochibun*) valued at no less than ¥50,000. The minimum capital amount was much more permissive than the ¥10 million minimum for a *kabushiki gaisha*. A Y.K. was also not required to issue certificates for investment units, whereas stock certificates were required for a K.K.

Unlike a K.K., a Y.K. does not need to have a board of directors or statutory auditors: the minimum requirement is one director (取締役, *torishimariyaku*).

Because of its simplified structure and relatively lax incorporation requirements, the Y.K. form is associated with small businesses. However, some larger companies have used the form: ExxonMobil's principal Japanese subsidiary, for instance, is a Y.K. with paid-in capital of ¥50 billion (US$420 million). In addition to simplified corporate governance, a Y.K. receives some tax benefits under foreign laws such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
