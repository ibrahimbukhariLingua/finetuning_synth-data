## Vodafone - Ghana Telecom Deal

On 3 July 2008 it was announced that Vodafone had agreed to acquire 70% of Ghana Telecom from the Ghanaian government at a cost of US$900 million and a total enterprise value of approximately US$1.3 billion.

After the transaction closed, Vodafone had a 70% stake in the company, while the Ghanaian government retained a 30% stake. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008.

The sale was supported by president John Agyekum Kufuor, but strongly opposed by the opposition party, which would win the presidential elections a few months later. The new president John Atta Mills, head of the National Democratic Congress party (NDC) also launched an investigation into the deal after being elected president a claiming that the government "did not get value for money".

Despite these claims, a few months later Vodafone would write down the value of its stake in Ghana Telecom by Â£250m as the economic climate worsened, damaging the business's prospects.

On 15 April 2009, Ghana Telecom, along with its mobile subsidiary OneTouch, was rebranded as Vodafone Ghana.

In 2016, Vodafone Ghana was the country's second largest operator with a market share for April 2016 as 21.92% and 25.32% of data behind African communications giant MTN Ghana.

In December 2019, Vodafone Ghana announced its acquisition of all of the Vodacom Group's stake in Vodacom Business Ghana.

In February 2023, Vodafone Group has concluded the sale of its 70% stake in Vodafone Ghana to Telecel Group in a bid to streamline its African portfolio.
