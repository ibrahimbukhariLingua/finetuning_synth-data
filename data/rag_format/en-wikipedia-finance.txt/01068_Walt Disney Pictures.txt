Walt Disney Pictures


# Walt Disney Pictures



**Walt Disney Pictures** is an American film production company and subsidiary of the Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company. The studio is the flagship producer of live-action feature films and animation within the Walt Disney Studios unit and is based at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. Animated films produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios are also released under the studio banner. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets the films produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

Disney began producing live-action films in the 1950s. The live-action division became Walt Disney Pictures in 1983, when Disney reorganized its entire studio division, which included the separation from the feature animation division and the subsequent creation of Touchstone Pictures. At the end of that decade, combined with Touchstone's output, Walt Disney Pictures elevated Disney to one of Hollywood's major film studios.

Walt Disney Pictures is currently one of five live-action film studios within the Walt Disney Studios, alongside Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Searchlight Pictures. *Inside Out 2* is the studio's highest-grossing release overall with $1.6 billion, and *Pirates of the Caribbean* is the studio's most successful commercial film franchise, with five films earning a total of over $4.5 billion in worldwide box office gross.


## History


### Predecessor unit

The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day the Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as the **Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio**, by filmmaker Walt Disney and his business partner and brother, Roy, in 1923.

The creation of Mickey Mouse and subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio, which was renamed as **The Walt Disney Studio** at the Hyperion Studio in 1926. In 1929, it was renamed again to Walt Disney Productions. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which becomes a huge financial success. With the profits from *Snow White*, Walt relocated to a third studio in Burbank, California.

In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such as *The Reluctant Dragon* (1941) and *Song of the South* (1946). That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release of Seal Island (1948), the first of the *True-Life Adventures* series and a subsequent Academy Award winner for Best Live-Action Short Film.

Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release of Treasure Island*,* considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures. By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as RKO Radio Pictures and United Artists and formed their own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution. By the 1950s, the company had purchased the rights to the work of L. Frank Baum.


### 1980s–2000s

The live-action division of Walt Disney Productions was incorporated as **Walt Disney Pictures** on April 1, 1983, to diversify film subjects and expand audiences for their film releases. In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEO Ron W. Miller as film president. Touchstone Films was started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for the studio's PG-13 and R-rated films with an expected half of Disney's yearly 6-to-8-movie slate, which would be released under the label. That same year, newly named Disney CEO Michael Eisner pushed out Berger, replacing him with Eisner's own film chief from Paramount Pictures, Jeffrey Katzenberg. and Frank Wells from Warner Bros. Pictures. Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures were formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.

The Touchstone Films banner was used by then-new Disney CEO Michael Eisner in the 1984–1985 television season with the short-lived western, *Wildside*. In the next season, Touchstone produced a hit in *The Golden Girls*.

David Hoberman was promoted to president of production at Walt Disney Pictures in April 1988. In April 1994, Hoberman was promoted to president of motion picture production at Walt Disney Studios, and David Vogel was appointed as Walt Disney Pictures president. The following year, however, Hoberman resigned from the company and instead began a production deal with Disney and his newly formed production company, Mandeville Films. In addition to Walt Disney Pictures, Vogel added the head position of Hollywood Pictures in 1997, while Donald De Line remained as head of Touchstone. Vogel was then promoted in 1998 to the head of Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group, the newly formed division that oversaw all live-action production within the Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Hollywood labels. The move was orchestrated by Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth, as an effort to scale back and consolidate the studio's film production. As a result of the restructuring, De Line resigned.

That same year, Nina Jacobson became executive vice-president of live-action production for Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group. Jacobson remained under this title until May 1999, when Vogel resigned from the company, and Jacobson was appointed by Roth to the role of president of production. During her tenure, Jacobson oversaw the production of films at Walt Disney Pictures, including *Pirates of the Caribbean, The Chronicles of Narnia, Bridge to Terabithia, National Treasure,* *Remember the Titans*, and The Princess Diaries*,* and was responsible for establishing a first-look deal with Jerry Bruckheimer Films. In 2006, Jacobson was fired by studio chairman Dick Cook, and replaced by Oren Aviv, the head of marketing. In July 2007, Disney CEO Bob Iger banned the depiction of smoking and tobacco products from Walt Disney Pictures films.

After two films based on Disney theme park attractions, Walt Disney Pictures selected it as a source of a line of films starting with *The Country Bears* (2002) and *The Haunted Mansion* and *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl* (both 2003). The latter film—the first film produced by the studio to receive a PG-13 rating—began a film series that was followed by four sequels, with the franchise taking in more than $5.4 billion worldwide from 2003 to 2017. On January 12, 2010, Aviv stepped down as the studio's president of live-action production.


### 2010s–present

In January 2010, Sean Bailey was appointed the studio's president of live-action production, replacing Aviv. Bailey had produced *Tron: Legacy* for the studio, which was released later that same year. Under Bailey's leadership and with support from then Disney CEO Bob Iger—and later studio chairman Alan Horn—Walt Disney Pictures pursued a tent-pole film strategy, which included an expanded slate of original and adaptive large-budget tentpole films. Beginning in 2011, the studio simplified the branding in its production logo and marquee credits to just "Disney". Concurrently, Disney was struggling with PG-13 tentpole films outside of the *Pirates of the Caribbean* series, with films such as John Carter (2012) and *The Lone Ranger* (2013) becoming some of the biggest box-office bombs of all time. However, the studio had found particular success with live-action fantasy adaptations of properties associated with their animated films, which began with the commercial success of *Alice in Wonderland* (2010), that became the second billion-dollar-grossing film in the studio's history. With the continued success of *Maleficent* (2014) and *Cinderella* (2015), the studio saw the potential in these fantasy adaptations and officiated a trend of similar films, which followed with *The Jungle Book* (2016) and *Beauty and the Beast* (2017). In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio's smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent.

Despite the acclaim and commercial success of several smaller-budgeted genre films throughout the 2010s, such as *The Muppets* (2011), *Saving Mr. Banks* (2013), and *Into the Woods* (2014), Walt Disney Pictures shifted its production model entirely on tent-pole films as they had found that a majority of the smaller genre films were becoming financially unsustainable in the theatrical market. By July 2016, Disney had announced development of nearly eighteen films consisting of sequels to existing adaptations, origin stories and prequels.

In 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced it was creating its own streaming service platform. The new service, known as Disney+, would feature original programming created by the company's vast array of film and television production studios, including Walt Disney Pictures. As part of this new distribution platform, Bailey and Horn confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures would renew development on smaller-budgeted genre films that the studio had previously stopped producing for the theatrical exhibition market a few years prior. In 2018, nine films were announced to be in production or development for the service. These films would be budgeted between $20 million and $60 million. The studio was expected to produce approximately 3–4 films per year exclusively for Disney+, alongside its theatrical tentpole slate. Disney+ was launched on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, with subsequent international expansions. Within the first two months of the service's launch, Walt Disney Pictures had released three films (*Lady and the Tramp*, *Noelle,* and *Togo*) exclusively for Disney+.

On March 12, 2020, 20th Century Family president Vanessa Morrison was named president of live-action development and production of streaming content for both Disney and 20th Century Studios, reporting directly to Bailey. That same day, Philip Steuer and Randi Hiller were also appointed as president of the studio's physical, post-production and VFX, and executive vice president for casting, respectively–overseeing these functions for both Walt Disney Pictures and 20th Century Studios. In 2023, Walt Disney Pictures celebrated its centennial alongside Walt Disney Animation Studios and their corporate parent company as a whole. That same year, *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny* marked the studio's first official co-production with Lucasfilm.

On February 26, 2024, Disney announced a leadership change, with Bailey stepping down as president and replaced by David Greenbaum, who formerly co-led Searchlight Pictures. Greenbaum will lead Walt Disney Pictures and co-lead 20th Century Studios with current 20th Century president Steve Asbell. On Feburary 19, 2025, Daria Cercek joined the studio as president of theatrical.


## Logo

Until 1983, instead of a traditional production logo, the opening credits of Disney films used to feature a title card that read "Walt Disney Presents", and later, "Walt Disney Productions Presents".

Beginning with the release of *Return to Oz* in 1985, Walt Disney Pictures introduced its fantasy castle logo. The version with its accompanying music premiered with *The Black Cauldron*. The logo was created by Walt Disney Productions in traditional animation and featured a white silhouette of Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle against a blue background, with the studio's name in Walt Disney's signature style and underscored by "When You Wish Upon a Star", in arrangement composed by John Debney. A short rendition of the logo was used as a closing logo as well as in the movie *Return to Oz*, although the film was released months before *The Black Cauldron* was released. An animated RenderMan variant appeared before every Pixar Animation Studios film from *Toy Story* until *Ratatouille*, featuring an original fanfare composed by Randy Newman, based on the opening score cue from *Toy Story*, called "Andy's Birthday". Beginning with *Dinosaur* (2000), an alternative logo featuring an orange castle and logo against a black background, was occasionally presented with darker tone and live-action films, though a few animated films such as *Brother Bear*, the 2003 re-release of *The Lion King* and *The Wild* (the final film to use this logo) used this logo.

In 2006, the studio's vanity card logo was updated with the release of *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* at the behest of then-Walt Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook and studio marketing president Oren Aviv. Designed by Disney animation director Mike Gabriel and producer Baker Bloodworth, the modernized logo was created completely in computer animation by Wētā FX and yU+co and featured a 3D Walt Disney logo. The final rendering of the logo was done by Cameron Smith and Cyrese Parrish. In addition, the revamped logo includes visual references to *Pinocchio*, *Dumbo*, *Cinderella*, *Peter Pan* and *Mary Poppins*, and its redesigned castle incorporates elements from both the Cinderella Castle and the Sleeping Beauty Castle, as well as fireworks and Walt Disney's family crest on the flag. Mark Mancina wrote a new composition and arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" to accompany the 2006 logo. It was co-arranged and orchestrated by David Metzger. In 2011, starting with *The Muppets*, the sequence was modified to truncate the "Walt Disney Pictures" branding to "Disney", which has mainly been used originally in home media releases in 2007. The new logo sequence has been consistently modified for high-profile releases including *Tron: Legacy*, *Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides*, *Oz the Great and Powerful*, *Maleficent*, *Tomorrowland*, *The Jungle Book*, and *Beauty and the Beast*.

In 2022, a new vanity card logo was introduced for the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, which premiered at the 2022 D23 Expo. The new castle logo features an updated opening sequence in computer animation created by Industrial Light & Magic and an arrangement of "When You Wish Upon a Star" composed by Christophe Beck and conducted by Tim Davies. The magical arc that usually flies from right to left above the castle now flies from left to right. A byline appeared below the Disney100 logo during the studio's 100th anniversary in 2023, reading "100 Years of Wonder", which was later removed starting with *Chang Can Dunk* but returned with the international prints of *Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny* in theaters. While containing the same visual references as the previous logo, new references added to it include *Pocahontas*, *Up*, *Hercules*, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*, *The Little Mermaid*, *Tangled*, *Brave* and *Beauty and the Beast*, with the addition of Disneyland's Matterhorn from *Third Man on the Mountain* and Pride Rock from *The Lion King* in the background beyond the castle. Its first film appearance was with the release of *Strange World*. The logo received widespread praise from critics and audiences and won Gold in the "Theatrical | Film: Design" medium at the 2023 Clio Entertainment Awards in November 2023. The standard version of the logo premiered theatrically with *The Beach Boys*.
