He was sentenced to judicial custody.

He was educated at the Laxmisagar Municipal Highschool and BJB College Bhubaneswar. Initially he took Physics for his graduation, but dropped it after one year to take up the study of Economics. He obtained his post graduate degree in economics from the Ravenshaw University.


## Realtor career

After his post graduation in Economics, Kanungo joined a real estate company as trainee field officer. He rose rapidly through the ranks and within two years he floated his own company, Shibani Estate and Promoters Ltd. By 2008, he had become a premier real estate developer of Odisha, winning the State Youth Entrepreneur Award.


## Career in media and film industry

Kanungo has produced four Oriya feature films and a number of music albums. The movies produced by him include the successful *"Rakhi Bandhili Mo Rakhiba Mana"* (2006), which won the ETV Film Award in 2011. On June 17, 2016, the Utkal Cine Chamber of Commerce announced that they would no longer provide any services or support to Kanungo due to fraud charges against him.

Kanungo founded the Oriya daily newspaper *"Ananya"* in 2012, and he also became the editor.


## Career as educationist

Kanungo set up the Sai Shibani International School in 2011 and became its founder chairman.

The mega fraud was a setback for the Shibani group of educational institutions.

Kanungo was involved in the multi-crore Odisha Gramya Bank gold loan scam. With the help of close associates and corrupt bank officials, he defrauded the bank of Rs 130Â million in March 2013 by pledging fake aluminium jewellery as "gold" mortgage. His modus operandi was similar to that of Harshad Mehta of the 1992 Mumbai stock market scam. Kanungo would avail of huge amounts of bank loan by mortgaging fake jewellery and purchase huge tracts of land through the loan. He would repay the loan after reselling the land at sky high prices. He raised hundreds of crores of rupees of bank loan by mortgaging the same fake jewellery 280 times in five years. His bullish activities in real estate was chiefly responsible for skyrocketing property prices in Bhubaneswar. The mega scam was exposed in May 2013 when the head office of Odisha Gramya Bank conducted enquiry into the unusual gold loan transactions at their Dumuduma branch with the help of the Central Bureau of Investigation. On 31 May 2013 CBI confirmed the direct involvement of Ratikant Kanungo in the mega fraud.

In August 2013 and again in December 2015, Kanungo was arrested for fraudulent transactions in which he would take money on the pretence of a land sale, but not transfer any real estate to the buyer.
