# HKR International



**HKR International Limited** (Chinese: 香港興業國際集團有限公司, abbreviated as HKRI) is a conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong. The company was founded by Cha Chi-ming, a textile industrialist from Shanghai and one of the pioneers of Hong Kong's industrial boom in the 1950-70s.

## History
