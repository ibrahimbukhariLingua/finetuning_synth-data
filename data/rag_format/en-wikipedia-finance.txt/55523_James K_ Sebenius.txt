At PON, he chairs the University's annual Great Negotiator Award program, which has recognized negotiators such as Richard Holbrooke, Lakdhar Brahimi, George Mitchell, and Bruce Wasserstein. He also co-directs a project to extensively interview all former U.S. Secretaries of State— including James Baker, George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and John Kerry—about their most challenging negotiations.

In 2021, Sebenius published an article in the Negotiation Journal on "Dealmaking Disrupted: The Unexplored Power of Social Media in Negotiation", and along with co-authors Ben Cook, David Lax and Paul Levy he published a Harvard Business Review article outlining a "Playbook for Negotiators in the Social Media Era."
