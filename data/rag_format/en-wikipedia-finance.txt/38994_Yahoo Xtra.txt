Yahoo Xtra


# Yahoo Xtra



**Yahoo!Xtra** was a New Zealand joint venture between Yahoo!7 and Telecom New Zealand (now Spark) that provided a web portal under the same name. Yahoo!7 held a 51 percent stake in the company and Telecom NZ held 49 percent. Because Yahoo!7 is a 50/50 venture, Yahoo! proper was therefore a 25.5% owner of Yahoo!Xtra. Telecom announced in April 2011 that it had sold its share to Yahoo!7 and Yahoo!Xtra was rebranded as Yahoo! New Zealand.


## History


### XtraMSN

Telecom launched Internet service provider Xtra in 1996, which was New Zealand's largest ISP (as of 2008ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ). In 2001 Telecom partnered with MSN to create the web portal XtraMSN, which by 2006 was receiving over 100 million total page impressions per month. Visitor numbers to XtraMSN grew by 45 percent in its last two years and the website attracted more than 3 million unique browsers per month.


### Move to Yahoo

In December 2006, Telecom made a new agreement, founding a joint venture with Australia's Yahoo!7 – itself a joint company between the Seven Network and Yahoo! – to form Yahoo!Xtra. The six-year-old Telecom and Microsoft portal ended on 1 March 2007, with the users invited to go to either YahooXtra.co.nz or Msn.co.nz.

Telecom reportedly left the content management of the portal to Yahoo!, who operate an Auckland-based office consisting of Sales, Marketing, Ad Operations, Production and Finance Departments. The Editorial team manages local news, sport and entertainment content.

When Telecom sold out in 2011, Yahoo!Xtra staff transferred to Yahoo! New Zealand. Telecom noted that Yahoo!7 would continue to support Telecom's broadband customers.


## Xtra Mail

Even after Telecom released its stake in Yahoo!Xtra, Yahoo! continued to provide Telecom's email service, which came under criticism in early 2013 following a spam and phishing attack described as the biggest to have ever hit New Zealand. Telecom automatically reset thousands of users' passwords. In April, Telecom announced that despite the issue, it would keep Yahoo! on as an email provider.

Between September 2016 and April 2017, Telecom – by this point known as Spark New Zealand – migrated Xtra Mail from Yahoo! to spark.co.nz. Spark partnered with New Zealand email provider SMX.


## Promotion

Yahoo!Xtra's 'X meets Y' promotion at launch featured a television commercial with Regina Spektor's song "Fidelity" playing whilst a young couple undertake in a lingering kiss. This helped throw the anti-folk star under the spotlight in the New Zealand music scene, "Fidelity" becoming a hit single and one of Spektor's most successful tracks.
