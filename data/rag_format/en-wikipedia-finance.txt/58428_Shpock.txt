## History

Shpock is a portmanteau meaning "**Sh**op in your **pock**et" and was first available for free download for iOS and Android devices in September 2012. The app was downloaded frequently within the first year. Their first financing came from their own funds and grants. Later, they were invested in by business angels.

In 2013, the Norwegian media group Schibsted announced a seven figures investment into Finderly GmbH. In September 2015, Schibsted announced to increase its stake from 82% to 91%.

In 2016, the Shpock app was highly ranked in Germany in the App Store and in Google Play, and in 2017, the Shpock app was one of the ten most loaded free iPhone apps in Austria. As of October 2018, the app has been downloaded more than 50 million times on iOS and Android devices.

In November 2018, Schibsted announced that it had purchased the remaining 9% of finderly GmbH from its founders, making it the sole owner of the company. A massive staff reduction was announced shortly after a change of management, with the goal of turning the previously loss-making company into a profitable business.
