The name Manweb continued to be used alongside the Scottish Power logo on home and retail publications until 2007, when it was replaced by ScottishPower. However, the Merseyside, Cheshire and North Wales electricity distributor continues as SP Manweb plc, which is managed, along with the Scottish network operators SP Distribution plc and SP Transmission plc, as SP Energy Networks. A fourth company, SP Power Systems Ltd, maintains the distribution networks for each of these companies.
