## History

Vasan Medical Centre, a chain of medical stores, was established in Trichy and Thanjavur in 1947 by AR Murugaiah, a former MP of Karur constituency. His son Dr. AM Arun, the founder of Vasan Healthcare Group, took over the business in 1991 after the death of his father. He established a diagnostic centre and laboratory and later founded two multi-speciality hospitals in Trichy. Arun, who died on 16 November 2020, started the group's first eye care hospital in Trichy in 2002.

Vasan Healthcare expanded rapidly in the early 2010s. As part of this growth, various businesses invested in Vasan. Among them are Sequoia India, Singapore government-backed GIC Investment, and WestBridge Capital, an Indian private and public equity fund. GIC Investment committed $100 million in mid-2012. In 2014, Sequoia India and WestBridge Capital together committed around $50 million over three rounds into Vasan.


## Controversies

In September 2015, a Chennai-based chartered accountant S Gurumurthy alleged that former Finance Minister of India P. Chidambaram had used firms to launder money using the Vasan Eye Care hospital chain, which he and his son owned through benami companies.


## Insolvency

In 2017, the insolvency process was started based on the order of the National Company Law Tribunal in Chennai in a petition filed by Alcon Laboratories (India) Pvt. Ltd., a supplier. The legal proceedings started after a legal stay from 2017 to October 2019.
