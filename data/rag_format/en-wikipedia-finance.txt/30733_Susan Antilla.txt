### False-light lawsuit

In 1994, Antilla wrote an article for the *New York Times* that repeated rumors spread by short-sellers suggesting Presstek Inc. chief executive officer Robert Howard was really a convicted felon named Howard Finkelstein. In an editors' note the next day, the *Times* said that there was no credible evidence to support the rumor and expressed regret for printing it. Howard sued in 1997, accusing Antilla of defamation and casting him in a false light. The *Times* was not sued by Howard. The jury ruled in Howard's favor on the false light issue, but denied the defamation claim.

In 2000 Antilla was ordered to pay damages of $480,000 to Howard. The court judgment was reversed by a federal appeals court in 2002. The judges wrote that “only a strained reading of the article” would result in a conclusion that Antilla had accused Howard of being Finkelstein.
