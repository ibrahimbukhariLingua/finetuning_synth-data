Sunday Times Rich List 2021


# Sunday Times Rich List 2021



The ***Sunday Times* Rich List 2021** is the 33rd annual survey of the wealthiest people resident in the United Kingdom, published by *The Sunday Times* online on 21 May 2021.

The list was edited by Robert Watts who succeeded long-term compiler Philip Beresford in 2017. He noted that "the fact many of the super-rich grew so much wealthier at a time when thousands of us have buried loved ones and millions of us worried for our livelihoods makes this a very unsettling boom."

The list was widely reported by other media.
