## Early life and education

Langwallner is one of two children born to Roswitha and Werner Langwallner. He was raised in Nussdorf am Haunsberg, north of Salzburg, Austria.

Langwallner holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Finance and Marketing from The Open University Business School in Milton Keynes, UK, following an Ingenieur's degree for Food Technology and Meat Processing at HTL Hollabrunn, and a diploma from the technical school for Agriculture in Salzburg at Schloss Klessheim.


## Career

In 2014, Langwallner co-founded NamZ â€“ a bio-science innovation incubator and predecessor to WhatIF Foods.

The dehydration technology innovated by Langwallner and Peter Cheetham at NamZ allowed the company to develop multi-colored noodles which use regenerative crops like the Bambara groundnut.

Langwallner founded WhaIF Foods, a consumer-facing brand, in 2020 to address what he calls the dysfunctional state of the food industry, which creates calorie-rich, nutrient poor foods in environmentally unsustainable ways, by adopting the technologies developed at NamZ.
