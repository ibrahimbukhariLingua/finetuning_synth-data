He began his business career at Rice Bros. in London and Manchester, prior to the First World War breaking out. He served in France with the 10th Royal Hussars and also served at General Headquarters. He was wounded during the war and mentioned in despatches.


## Career

In 1926, Hanbury-Williams joined textile company Courtaulds in Coventry before being transferred to the company's headquarters in London. He concentrated on the company's yarn trade overseas and soon oversaw administration of Courtaulds' foreign-affiliated companies. In 1930, he was elected to the company's board of directors. In 1935, he was appointed a managing director, concentrating on the companies international trade. He was directly involved in the founding of British Cellophane.

In 1936, Hanbury-Williams was elected to the court of directors of the Bank of England, and served as a director until his retirement in February 1963. From 1940 to his retirement, he also served as a member of the Bank of England's Committee of Treasury.

Prior to the Second World War, Hanbury-Williams was responsible for Courtaulds involvement with nylon, invented in 1935 by DuPont. After the War began, he worked full-time as an executive director of the Bank of England in 1940–41. In 1942, he served under the Minister of Economic Warfare, Lord Selborne. In 1943, he returned to Courtaulds and was appointed deputy chairman. In 1946, he succeeded Samuel Courtauld as chairman of the company.

Courtaulds had suffered during the wartime years and had been forced to sell off its almost wholly owned American subsidiary, the American Viscose Corporation, for badly needed dollars for Great Britain. Post-war, the company also needed to replenish its staff across the board and underwent a period of major recruitment. A particular achievement for Hanbury-Williams was the return to the United States in 1951 with the establishment of a new American subsidiary, Courtaulds, Inc.
