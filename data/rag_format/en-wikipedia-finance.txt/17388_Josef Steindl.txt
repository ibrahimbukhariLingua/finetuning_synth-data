Josef Steindl


# Josef Steindl



**Josef Steindl** (14 April 1912 – 7 March 1993) was an Austrian-born Post-Keynesian economist.


## Career

He was at the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) (1935–38) (Ludwig von Mises Institute) but moved to the UK in 1938 to lecture at Oxford University. There he worked with a group of other European exiles from Fascism, including Michał Kalecki. Kalecki has been described as being Steindl's role-model—with his work resembling part of Kalecki's not only in substance but also in style.

In 1950 he returned to WIFO until his retirement in 1978.
