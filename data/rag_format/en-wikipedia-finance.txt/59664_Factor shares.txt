Factor shares


# Factor shares



In macroeconomics, **factor shares** are the share of production given to the factors of production, usually capital and labor. This concept uses the methods and fits into the framework of neoclassical economics.


## Derivation

In exogenous growth models, the production function can be represented by:

{\displaystyle Y=F(K,L)\,}

with *Y* total production, *K* capital, and *L* labor.
So a representative agent will attempt to maximize a profit function:

{\displaystyle \pi =max\_{\{K,L\}}F(K,L)\*P-(rK+wL)\,}

where {\displaystyle rK+wL\,} is the cost to the firm, *r* the rental rate of capital, *w* the wage rate for labor, and *P* is the price of the output.

As in microeconomics supply and demand models, first-order conditions that the derivative of this function with respect to capital and labor will be zero at the functions maximum. Thus (assuming *P = 1*) we can calculate the wages and the rental rate of capital:

{\displaystyle w=D\_{L}[F(K,L)]\,} and {\displaystyle r=D\_{K}[F(K,L)]\,}.

Now we can write the expenditure allocated to labor as {\displaystyle wL=D\_{L}[F(K,L)]\*L\,}

and to capital as {\displaystyle rK=D\_{K}[F(K,L)]\*K\,}

So the factor share devoted to labor is:

{\displaystyle wL/Y=D\_{L}[F(K,L)]\*L/F(K,L)\,}

and the factor share devoted to capital is:

{\displaystyle rK/Y=D\_{K}[F(K,L)]\*K/F(K,L)\,}
