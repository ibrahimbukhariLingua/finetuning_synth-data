Revenue stamps of Pakistan


# Revenue stamps of Pakistan



**Pakistan** first issued revenue stamps when it became independent in 1947 and continues to issue revenues to this day. In addition to national issues, the provinces of Balochistan, North West Frontier, Punjab, Sindh, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir, West Pakistan and the capital Islamabad also have or had their own stamps.

Until 1947 Pakistan was part of India, and used Indian revenue stamps. A number of princely states which issued their own revenues also became part of Pakistan following independence, and therefore may also be considered as Pakistani forerunner issues. These include Bahawalpur and Las Bela. Prior to 1971, Pakistani national issues were used in both West Pakistan and East Pakistan. Later that year East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh, which issues its own revenues to this day.


## National issues

Like Great Britain and India, some of Pakistan's revenues were keytypes. They showed the star and crescent, Pakistan's national insignia. They were used for the following purposes:

* Agreement (c.1950)
* Broker's Note (c.1950)
* Displaced Persons Adhesive (c.1950-c.1961)
* Foreign Bill (1947-c.1992)
* Identification Card (c.1990)
* Insurance (1947-c.1992)
* Notarial (1947-c.1992)
* Notarial High Court (c.1960)
* Refugee Adhesive (c.1950)
* Share Transfer (c.1947-c.1995)
* Special Adhesive (1947-2003)

Apart from keytypes, some types of revenue stamps had their own specific designs. These include:

* Attestation (c.1960)
* Central Excise Revenue (c.1958-c.1990)
* Court Fees (1948–present)
* Entertainment (c.1965-c.1972)
* Income Tax (1991-1992)
* Insurance (c.1995–present)
* National Identity Card (c.2010–present)
* Passport and Visa (c.1950)
* Revenue (1947–present)
* Welfare (c.1972)

## West Pakistan

Prior to Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 in 1971, the territory of modern-day Pakistan was known as West Pakistan (with Bangladesh being East Pakistan), and some revenue issues were made exclusively for this area. Around 1956, Bahawalpur Court Fee, Notarial and Receipt stamps were overprinted for use in the new state. Later Pakistani Court Fee stamps were overprinted for use as Arms Licence stamps in West Pakistan. In 1969 and 1970, stamps were issued for Arms Licence, Driving Licence and Motor Vehicles Tax, and these were in use before being replaced by separate issues for the provinces in 1971.
