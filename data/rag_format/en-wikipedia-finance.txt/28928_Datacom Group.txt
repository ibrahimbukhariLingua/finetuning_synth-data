## History


### 1960s

Datacom was founded as Computer Bureau Ltd in 1965 by two Christchurch accountants, Dr Bernard Battersby and Paul Hargreaves.

A group of clients put up the original capital for the company - Â£30,000 - and an order was placed for an ICL 1902 computer, which didn't arrive in New Zealand for another year.

The company hired its first systems analysts and programmers in August 1965 and installed the first computer for a client in September of the following year.

In 1968, the company, now called CBL added additional offices in Wellington, Auckland and Hamilton between 1968 and 1970.
