**Cassa di Risparmio della Città e Provincia di Vercelli** was formed by the royal decree on 19 August 1851. Due to Legge Amato, it was split into **Cassa di Risparmio di Vercelli S.p.A.** and **Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Vercelli** on 23 December 1991 (gazetted on 24 January 1992).

The foundation further reduced the ownership as their investment in 1997 by selling around 14.4% shares of the bank to Banca Commerciale Italiana.
