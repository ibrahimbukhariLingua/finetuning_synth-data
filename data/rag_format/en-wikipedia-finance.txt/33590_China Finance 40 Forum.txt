China Finance 40 Forum


# China Finance 40 Forum



The **China Finance 40 Forum** or **CF40** is a Chinese think tank created in 2008 which specializes on issues of economic and financial policy. In January 2021, the University of Pennsylvania's Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program ranked CF40 as #8 top think tank in China, and #31 among think tanks in China, India, Japan
and the Republic of Korea.


## History and development

CF40 was created on 12 April 2008 as a club of 40 finance experts under 40 years of age, thus its name. It was founded and developed by Wang Haiming, previously a journalist and chief editor at 21st Century Business Herald. Chen Yuan was its founding chairman.

CF40 is based in Beijing. It has also created the Shanghai Finance Institute (SFI) in Shanghai and the Northern Finance Institute (NFI) in Tianjin, in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Both these institutes have had Wang Haiming as their Executive President from their creation.

CF40 organizes events and conferences, alone or in partnership with other think tanks that have included Bruegel the Euro 50 Group, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

One of CF40's flagship events is the yearly "Bund Summit" in Shanghai, a series that started in 2019. The 2020 Bund Summit was the venue for Jack Ma's speech on financial regulation in China which has been widely associated with the suspension of Ant Group's initial public offering.

CF40 publishes studies and a periodical journal, *China Finance Review*. Its yearly "Jingshan Report" is a reference publication on China's financial system.
