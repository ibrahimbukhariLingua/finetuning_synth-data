## Valleyfield greenhouse

Green Organic Dutchman's Valleyfield greenhouse is an 820,000-square-foot (76,000 m²) facility on Boulevard Gérard-Cadieux in Valleyfield, Quebec (45°14′02″N 74°06′22″W﻿ / ﻿45.234°N 74.106°W﻿ / 45.234; -74.106). Power rates the company secured were reported to be 4 cents per kilowatt-hour, attributed to the nearby Beauharnois Hydroelectric Generating Station. The greenhouse, when completed, will be over twice the area of Tweed Farms, Canada's largest cannabis greenhouse in 2014. The Valleyfield greenhouse completed construction in 2020 but was eventually sold to Cannara Biotech in 2021 for 27 million dollars as a result of The Green Organic Dutchman’s need to repay creditors.
