## History

DE-CIX was founded in 1995 by three Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Back then, German Internet traffic was still exchanged in the United States. To improve latency and reduce costs for backhaul connectivity, three providers decided to establish an Internet Exchange in the back room of a postal office in Gutleutviertel in Frankfurt. Hamburg-based MAZ, EUnet from Dortmund and XLink from Karlsruhe were the first to connect their networks in Frankfurt at DE-CIX.

DE-CIX was originally managed by Electronic Commerce Forum, now known as eco – Association of the Internet Industry. Other providers joined and made DE-CIX and Frankfurt the hotspot for the German internet. In 1998, DE-CIX moved its switching hardware to the Interxion data center in Frankfurt.

By 2000, DE-CIX had become Germany's largest Internet Exchange and was ranked as one of the larger Internet Exchanges in Europe. DE-CIX added its second switching site at the Interxion campus in 2001 and a third site in close proximity to its original roots at the TelecityGroup data center in 2004.

Until 2006, Cisco switches supported the growth in customers and traffic. DE-CIX extended its reach to additional data centers, introducing Force10 and Brocade switches and scaling the platform to over 700 10-Gigabit ports. Over the years, DE-CIX has attracted networks from all over the world, especially from Eastern Europe, leading to an annual traffic growth rate of up to 100 percent per year.

In 2012, DE-CIX began its international expansion with the establishment of its first IX outside of Germany, UAE-IX powered by DE-CIX, together with partner du/datamena, in Dubai. Following this, in 2014, DE-CIX established its first IX in North America with the launch of DE-CIX New York. Further expansions followed in close succession, in Southern Europe in 2016, in India in 2018 in India with Mumbai-IX powered by DE-CIX, later to become DE-CIX Mumbai, and in 2021 in Southeast Asia.

In 2013, DE-CIX introduced DE-CIX Apollon, its new Ethernet-based platform. Today, the platform utilizes the ADVA Optical Networking FSP 3000 and Infinera CloudExpress 2 gear for the optical backbone, and Nokia’s 7950 XRS series and Nokia’s 7750 SR-s series for the IP network. The optical backbone has a total capacity of 48 Terabits per second across a mesh-network topology and provides transport speeds of up to 8 Terabits per second per fiber. DE-CIX Apollon utilizes DWDM equipment and is built on a switching layer supported by Nokia (former Alcatel-Lucent) service routers, which support up to 1440x100 Gigabit Ethernet ports or up to 288x400 Gigabit Ethernet ports.

In 2017, DE-CIX began to develop interconnection services for the enterprise sector, beginning with the introduction of DirectCLOUD, a service that enables customers to access cloud service providers. In 2022, the DirectCLOUD service enables connectivity to more than 50 cloud service providers, including specialized local CSPs and global hyperscalers. Other interconnection services specifically designed for the needs of enterprises include: the Microsoft Azure Peering Service, Closed User Groups, and InterconnectionFLEX.

In 2019, DE-CIX was one of 3 IX operators to jointly develop the IX-API, which provides the basis for the automation of interconnection services over IXPs. In 2021, DE-CIX received a patent for its security service “Blackholing Advanced”, which enables innovative filtering mechanisms in the protection of networks against DDoS attacks.


### Up from 2020

In September 2022, more than 3,000 network operators (carriers), Internet service providers (ISPs), content providers, corporate networks and other organizations from more than 100 countries were connected to DE-CIX, including major carriers, content and Internet service providers, and numerous enterprise customers. The company operates approx. 40 IXs on 4 continents, and its interconnection services are accessible from data centers in 600+ cities worldwide.

In September 2022, a data throughput of 13.65 terabits per second was achieved at DE-CIX Frankfurt for the first time. According to its Annual Report 2021, DE-CIX had a connected customer capacity of over 96.2 Tbit/s at the end of 2021.

The IX operator experienced massive growth during the Covid-19 pandemic, regularly breaking traffic throughput records. DE-CIX Frankfurt, for example, exceeded 9 tbit/s peak traffic for the first time in March 2020, and 10 tbit/s in November of the same year.


## Interception by BND and NSA

German BND is intercepting DE-CIX traffic since the data-center-neutral Internet Exchanges was build in 2009. German Federal Inteligent Agency is allowed of intercepting 25 German based Internet-Service-Provider like 1&1, Freenet, Strato AG, QSC, Lambdanet and Plusserver. Chanellor office in 2009 put pressure on De-CIX to cooperate with the BND.

The BND mirrors the daily traffic via DE-CIX and evaluates it.

The DE-CIX node in New York is operated by DE-CIX North America Inc., a subsidiary of the German company. This is subject to US law. The DE-CIX node UAE-IX in Dubai must also "comply with the local legal regulations on the transfer of data.
