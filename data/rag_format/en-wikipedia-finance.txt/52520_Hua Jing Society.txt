Hua Jing Society


# Hua Jing Society



The **Hua Jing Society** is an organization based in Hong Kong that serves to network princelings. It is a social club for princelings who have studied outside of China and then moved to Hong Kong.


## Founding by Fang Fang

The organization was started in 2011 by Fang Fang, who was CEO of JP Morgan's China division. Fang resigned in March 2014 while JP Morgan was under investigation for hiring princelings, and was quoted as saying "You all know I have always been a big believer of the Sons and Daughters program." Fang was involved in the giving Gao Jue, son of Gao Hucheng, a job within JP Morgan even though Gao Jue was deemed unqualified by the bank. The New York Times stated that Fang's "deep network of contacts in Chinese government and business circles helped introduce a flow of lucrative underwriting and advisory roles to the bank."

Two days after his resignation, ICAC searched JP Morgan's office in Central to get documents from his office. Fang was arrested by ICAC in May 2014 and released on bail, with the condition that he not leave Hong Kong. In 2016, JP Morgan paid USD $264 million to the United States to resolve allegations it hired Chinese princelings. In 2017, The Federal Reserve of the United States said it was seeking to fine Fang Fang $1 million and permanently ban him from working in the banking industry for his involvement in a corrupt hiring program.


## History

According to the 2019 book *Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Hong Kong*, the organization participates in activities that emphasize cultivating interactions between Hong Kong and mainland China. It was a supporter of CY Leung's election in 2012, and after he became Chief Executive, many members of the Hua Jing Society were appointed into government committees. Examples listed by the book include Fang Fang, who was appointed to the government's Commission of Strategic Development twice, spanning 2013 to 2017. Another member, Judy Chen Qing, served in the Central Policy Unit, the Major Sports Events Committee, and the Civic Education Committee. Chen Shuang, another member, was appointed to the newly-created Financial Services Development Council in 2013.
