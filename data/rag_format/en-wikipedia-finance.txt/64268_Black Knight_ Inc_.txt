## Controversies

The 2010 robo-signing scandal exposed questionable behavior on the part of employees of a small subsidiary of the company. In addition to the federal government, states such as Nevada filed legal proceedings against these employees. The investigation of these business practices were featured in an episode of 60 Minutes. Eventually LPS settled with the federal government and other states and ceased operations of the problematic subsidiary. Some controversy surrounded the resignation of two attorneys who had investigated LPS as part of their work for Florida's Economic Crime Division, as they claimed to have resigned under pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had received campaign contributions from LPS.

On November 4, 2019, Black Knight took the unprecedented step of taking legal action against one of its clients, PennyMac Financial Services for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. Within 24 hours, PennyMac had filed a retaliatory lawsuit against Black Knight for alleged anti-competitive practices. The PennyMac case has since been moved from the California court in which the mortgage lender and servicer had filed suit and to Florida, where Black Knight had filed the original complaint. The case went to arbitration in June 2020.
