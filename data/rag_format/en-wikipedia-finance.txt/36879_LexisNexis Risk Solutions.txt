## History

A subsidiary of RELX (formerly Reed Elsevier), LexisNexis Risk Solutions first began as the Risk & Information Analytics Group (RIAG) within LexisNexis, a corporation offering legal database services. In 2000, Reed Elsevier acquired RiskWise and PeopleWise, which together became the basis of RIAG. The creation of RIAG expanded LexisNexis offerings to include public records collections. In 2000, LexisNexis also launched HPCC Systems, its data-intensive computing system platform.

In 1994, Reed Business Information (later Reed Elsevier and now RELX),acquired ICIS-LOR thereby adding extensive price reporting on chemicals and oil to the Reed Business Information chemicals portfolio.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions moved into Collections after Reed Elsevier acquired the public records businesses of Dolan Media Company in 2003. That same year, the LexisNexis Special Services Inc.

## Corporate social responsibility



### Missing children


#### U.S.

LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the ADAM (Automated Delivery of Alerts on Missing children) program in 2000 to help the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) find missing children. ADAM distributes missing child alert posters to law enforcement, hospitals, libraries and businesses within specific geographic search areas. The system was expanded in 2017 to allow individuals to receive an email alert when a child is reported missing near to them.

In 2017, a feature was added to ADAM to allow NCMEC to focus on a highway where a missing child and abductor may be travelling to distribute posters to recipients along the relevant corridor. Combining this filter along with the system's radius search allows for broad, yet targeted, poster coverage. Functionality was added to ADAM to allow members of the public to sign up for missing child email alerts in their area. More than 1.8 million individuals, private enterprises, hospitals, schools, news outlets and law agencies have signed up to receive automated ADAM alerts.


#### U.K.

In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions began working with the charity Missing People and the UK National Crime Agency to support their Child Rescue Alert service, which disseminates missing alerts via text message. Along with Charlie Hedges Advisory (one of the U.K.’s foremost experts on missing persons), LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Missing People scoped a training course to assist law enforcement, schools, hospitals and others with missing cases, particularly those involving children who are abducted and/or trafficked.


### Food stamp fraud prevention

Since 2013, the Florida Department of Children and Families used LexisNexis Risk Solutions for its identity management solutions to prevent food stamp fraud and improve operational efficiencies, achieving a total cost avoidance of more than $843.7 million.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Humanitarian emergency education

In 2017, LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed the Global Business Coalition for Education's Rapid Education Action (REACT) database to record private sector educational contributions and assets that can be deployed quickly in the wake of a humanitarian emergency.


### Law enforcement


#### PSDE database

The Public Safety Data Exchange (PSDEX) is a contributory database that of more than 1,300 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that was created by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. PSDEX helps its participants solve crimes, identify threats and anticipate future threats. LexisNexis Risk Solutions created an Advisory Committee to advise on policy and governance of PSDEX data, to help assure adherence to federal Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), state and local standards for security and privacy of law enforcement-provided data. The PSDEX Advisory Committee is composed of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Secret Service, metropolitan police department and other criminal justice experts, in partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions leaders.


#### LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center

The LexisNexis Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives law enforcement “greater visibility into crime in both their jurisdictions and nationwide by linking billions of public records with agency-provided data.” It links to PSDEX and brings together disconnected data to provide a more comprehensive view of people's identities so that law enforcement agencies can better target investigations, identify patterns, predict upcoming events and deploy resources more efficiently.


## COVID-19


### COVID-19 analyzer

In April, 2020, LexisNexis Risk Solutions created a free tracking tool to monitor and report the progress of the COVID-19 virus and provide better contextual understanding of the pandemic's evolution. Using data from Johns Hopkins University (daily cases and deaths), the US Census Bureau (US population) and the UN DESA (world population), the tracker provides metrics and analysis for locations across the globe, with maps that drill down to country and regional levels, helping to understand how the virus is propagating.

In July 2020, researchers from Florida Atlantic University's College of Engineering and Computer Science in collaboration with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, received a grant for Rapid Research (RAPID) from the National Science Foundation to develop a model of COVID-19 spread using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools. The project leverages prior experience in modeling Ebola spread to successfully model the spread of COVID-19.


### COVID-19 Data Resource Center

The Health Care segment of LexisNexis Risk Solutions announced in April 2020 the launch of a free COVID-19 Data Resource Center to provide county-level insights on at-risk populations and potential care capacity gaps to support the U.S. healthcare industry's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. By combining its own data and analytics with those of other industry stakeholders, the company created insights to be used by healthcare organizations, public health officials and health researchers to help allocate resources to the populations with the greatest need. The COVID-19 Data Resource Center features heat maps with insights that identify at-risk populations and correlated gaps in provider coverage. Each county is assigned a percentile rank on a scale of 0 (low-risk) to 100 (high-risk) across various parameters. The map is updated regularly to quickly address the care needs of the community. In June 2020, the group added national telehealth trending insights to its COVID-19 Data Resource Center to show exponential growth of telehealth adoption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
