# Drink industry



The **drink industry** (or **drinks industry**, also known as the **beverage industry**) produces drinks, in particular alcoholic beverage, ready to drink and soft drink products.

Drink production can vary greatly depending on the product being made. ManufacturingDrinks.com explains that "bottling facilities differ in the types of bottling lines they operate and the types of products they can run". Drinks may be bottled in glass, plastic or in can. Innovations in the drink industry, catalysed by requests for non-alcoholic drinks, include Hot-fill or cold-fill, drink plants, processing, and packing.
