# Bit (app)



**bit** (**בִּיט**) is a payment application by Bank Hapoalim, allows users to send and receive payments. The app is available for Android and iOS.

In February 2021, the Bank of Israel approved Bit as a digital wallet.


## History

The app developed by Bank Hapoalim and was launched in December 2016 as a platform for smartphone payments, charging the payer's credit card. At first, the app supported person-to-person transfers. Later, a payment request feature was introduced. A group payment option was then added, allowing users to select contacts or share a link via WhatsApp.

Later, Bit enabled its users to receive refunds from insurance companies, pension funds, and healthcare services directly to their bank account. In addition, bit began allowing payments on various websites and applications. Furthermore, bit offers businesses and freelancers the option to receive payments via the app.

In August 2020, Bank Hapoalim announced the opening of the app’s API for developers.


## Payment process

The recipient of the payment is identified by their mobile phone number, which must also have the bit app installed. Once the payer completes the transaction via the app, the recipient receives a notification about the payment and must confirm receipt within three days. The recipient’s phone number can be selected from a list of previous recipients or entered manually.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Money transfers through the app, when conducted between private users, are charged to the payer’s credit card, which is billed on the card’s payment date, while the recipient receives the funds immediately in their account.

The total transfer amount is limited to 3,600 NIS per day and 8,300 NIS per month. The maximum amount a non-business account can receive annually via bit is 50,000 NIS.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
