SignalFx


# SignalFx



**SignalFx** is a SaaS-based monitoring and analytics platform based in San Mateo, California. It allows customers to analyze, visualize, automate, and alert on metrics data from infrastructure, applications, micro-services, containers, and functions. The platform uses a streaming architecture to separate metric data points into two streams: one for metadata, and one for time-series values. These data streams are routed through a pub-sub bus to SignalFlow, an analytics language accessible via the 'SignalFx' GUI and programmable APIs. The platform can handle millions of data points per second at a 1-second resolution, achieving less than 2 seconds of latency from ingestion to alert.


## History

SignalFx was co-founded by Karthik Rau and Phillip Liu in February 2013. SignalFx received $8.5 million in a Series A investment from Andreessen Horowitz, adding Ben Horowitz to its board.
