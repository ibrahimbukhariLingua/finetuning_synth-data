## History

Thomson acquired magazine publisher Faulkner & Gray in 1992. Thomson Financial expanded significantly when it acquired **Primark**, another financial information provider, on June 6, 2000, for $842 million in an all-cash deal. Primark owned many brands in both the U.S. and UK/Europe such as Datastream, Baseline Financial, Intellivate Capital Ventures (ICV), and IBES. The acquisition consolidated and combined competing financial information provision, for example the FirstCall and IBES earnings estimate data, under the same company.

Thomson Financial sold its Thomson Media division in 2004.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
