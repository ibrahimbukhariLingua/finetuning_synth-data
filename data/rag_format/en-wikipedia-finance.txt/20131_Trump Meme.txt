# Trump Meme



**Trump Meme** (abbreviation: **TRUMP**), officially known as **OFFICIAL TRUMP**, is a cryptocurrency announced by U.S. president-elect Donald Trump in January 2025. As of January 18, it has a market capitalization of US$6 billion.


## Implementation

Trump Meme is a cryptocurrency developed on the Solana blockchain platform. According to TRUMP's website, 200 million coins have been issued, with an additional 800 million set to be issued over three years. Four-fifths of TRUMP's supply is held by CIC Digital, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, a company partially owned by CIC Digital whose name refers to the words said by Trump after he was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC are prevented from releasing their tokens for three years. The cryptocurrency is being funded by Binance and Gate.

Prior to Trump Meme's introduction, several Trump meme coins had emerged, including TrumpCoin, MAGA, and Doland Tremp. Convicted businessman Martin Shkreli claimed that he had created TrumpCoin with Trump's son Barron.


## Announcement

On January 17, 2025, three days before the second inauguration of Donald Trump, Trump Meme was released; the lack of an initial announcement led to concerns that the cryptocurrency was a scam and had no association to the president-elect. Trump announced TRUMP several hours later on his X and Truth Social accounts. As of January 18, TRUMP was valued at US$32, giving it a fully diluted valuation of US$32 billion and a market capitalization of US$6 billion. Following TRUMP's release, Solana surged ten percent.

The release of Trump Meme was condemned by ethics lawyers, including Adav Noti, the director of the Campaign Legal Center, and Jordan Libowitz, the vice president for communications at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Nick Tomaino, a former executive at Coinbase, described Trump's ownership and the timing of the cryptocurrency as "predatory". Anthony Scaramucci, who formerly served as Trump's White House Director of Communications for ten days, said that Trump's involvement with TRUMP was "Idi Amin level corruption."
