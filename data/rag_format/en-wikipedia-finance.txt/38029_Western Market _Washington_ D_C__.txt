# Western Market (Washington, D.C.)



**Western Market** was a market located in the city of Washington, D.C. It originally opened in 1802 and closed in 1961.


## History


### Original Market

Western Market was one of the three marketplaces planned in Pierre L'Enfant's plan for Washington, D.C. It also included Center Market and Eastern Market. It was opened in 1802 on 20th and H Streets, in the block between H and I Streets NW, 20th and 21st Streets NW, and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. This market closed in 1856.


### Second Market

After its closing, Western Market moved to a new location at 21st and K Streets NW. This market closed in 1961 and was demolished to make room for an office building to be built on that block. This left Eastern Market to be the only one of the original three markets (Western, Center, and Eastern) left open.
