She is known for her work developing silicon-on-insulator semiconductor manufacturing technologies and more efficient semiconductor chips during her time as vice president of IBM's Semiconductor Research and Development Center.

Su was appointed president and CEO of AMD in October 2014, after joining the company in 2012 and holding roles such as senior vice president of AMD's global business units and chief operating officer. She previously served on the board of Cisco Systems and is currently on the board of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association, in addition to being a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Recognized with a number of awards and accolades, Su was named Executive of the Year by *EE Times* in 2014 and one of the World's Greatest Leaders in 2017 by *Fortune*. She became the first woman to receive the IEEE Robert Noyce Medal in 2021. During her tenure as CEO of AMD, the market capitalization of AMD has grown from roughly $3 billion to more than $200 billion. AMD also overtook Intel in market capitalization for the first time. In 2024, Su was selected the Fellow of Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).


## Early life and education

Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in November of 1969 in Tainan, Taiwan. She was born in a Taiwanese Hokkien speaking family. She immigrated to the United States at the age of 3 with her parents Su Chun-hwai (蘇春槐) and Sandy Lo (羅淑雅). Both she and her brother were encouraged to study math and science as children. When she was seven, her father, a retired statistician, began quizzing her on multiplication tables. Her mother, an accountant who later became an entrepreneur, introduced her to business concepts.

Su sought to become an engineer at a young age. She recalled, "I just had a great curiosity about how things worked". When she was 10, she began taking apart and then fixing her brother's remote control cars, and she owned her first computer in junior high school, an Apple II. She attended the Bronx High School of Science in New York City, graduating in 1986.

Su began attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the fall of 1986, intending to major in either electrical engineering or computer science. She settled on electrical engineering, recollecting that it seemed like the most difficult major. During her freshman year she worked as an undergraduate research assistant "manufacturing test silicon wafers for graduate students" through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). The project, and her summer jobs at Analog Devices, fueled her interest in semiconductors. She remained focused on the topic for the remainder of her education, spending much of her time in labs designing and adjusting products.

After earning her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, Su obtained her master's degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1991. From 1990 to 1994, she studied for her PhD.. in electrical engineering under doctoral advisors Dimitri A. Antoniadis and James E. Chung. *MIT Technology Review* reports that as a doctoral candidate, Su was "one of the first researchers to look into silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a then unproven technique for increasing transistors' efficiency by building them atop layers of an insulating material". She graduated with her Ph.D. in electrical engineering from MIT in 1994. Her dissertation was titled, "Extreme-submicrometer silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFETs"*.*


## Career

Su has been on the boards of Analog Devices, Cisco Systems, Inc., the Global Semiconductor Alliance, and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association. As of 2016 she has published over forty technical articles and coauthored a book chapter discussing next-generation consumer electronics.


### 1994–1999: Texas Instruments and IBM R&D

In June 1994, Su became a member of the technical staff at Texas Instruments, working in the company's Semiconductor Process and Device Center (SPDC) until February 1995. That month, IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics, and she was appointed vice president of IBM's semiconductor research and development center.

During her time at IBM, Su played a "critical role" in developing the "recipe" to make copper connections work with semiconductor chips instead of aluminum, "solving the problem of preventing copper impurities from contaminating the devices during production". Working with various IBM design teams on the details of the device, Su explained, "my specialty was not in copper, but I migrated to where the problems were". The copper technology was launched in 1998, resulting in new industry standards and chips that were up to 20% faster than the conventional versions.


### 2000–2007: IBM Emerging Products division

In 2000, Su was given a year-long assignment as the technical assistant for Lou Gerstner, IBM's CEO. She subsequently took on the role of director of emerging projects, stating that "I was basically director of myself – there was no one else in the group". As head and founder of IBM's Emerging Products division, Su ran an internal startup and hired ten employees to focus on biochips and "low-power and broadband semiconductors". Their first product was a microprocessor that improved battery life in phones and other handheld devices. *MIT Technology Review* named her a "Top Innovator Under 35" in 2001, in part due to her work with Emerging Products.

Through her division, Su represented IBM in a collaboration to create next-generation chips with Sony and Toshiba. Ken Kutaragi charged the collaboration with "improving the performance of game machine processors by a factor of 1,000", and Su's team eventually came up with the idea for a nine-processor chip, which later became the Cell microprocessor used to power devices such as the Sony PlayStation 3. She continued as vice president of the semiconductor research and development center at IBM, holding the role until May 2007.


### 2007–2011: Freescale Semiconductor

Su joined Freescale Semiconductor in June 2007 as chief technology officer (CTO), heading the company's research and development until August 2009. From September 2008 until December 2011, she was senior vice president and general manager of Freescale's networking and multimedia group, and was responsible for global strategy, marketing, and engineering for the company's embedded communications and applications processor business. As head of the company's networking-chip business, *EE Times* credited her with helping Freescale get "its house in order", with the company filing for an IPO in 2011.


### 2012–2014: AMD appointments

Su became senior vice president and general manager at AMD in January 2012, overseeing the company's global business units and the "end-to-end business execution" of AMD's products. Over the next two years she "played a prominent role" in pushing the company to diversify beyond the PC market, including working with Microsoft and Sony to place AMD chips in Xbox One and PS4 game consoles.

On 8 October 2014, AMD announced Su's appointment to president and CEO, replacing Rory Read. Su stated that her plan for the company involved focusing on making the "right technology investments", streamlining the product line, and continuing to diversify, also asserting that she wanted to "simplify" the company and accelerate the development of new technology. A number of analysts praised the appointment due to Su's credentials, noting AMD was seeking growth in product areas where Su had "extensive experience".


### 2015–2016: AMD diversification

When Su joined AMD in 2012, about 10 percent of sales came from non-PC products. By February 2015, roughly 40 percent of AMD's sales came from non-PC markets, such as video game consoles and embedded devices. In May 2015, Su and other AMD executives presented a long-term strategy for the company to focus on developing high-performance computing and graphics technologies for three growth areas: gaming, datacenter, and "immersive platforms" markets.

In January 2016, Su announced that AMD was working on new FinFET-based chips to create a new line of microprocessors, products, accelerated processing units (APUs), graphics chips, and semi-custom chip designs for unreleased video game consoles. AMD's share value spiked in July 2016, when AMD reported strong revenue growth. *Fortune* attributed the "impressive" statistic to Su, stating she "continues to execute on her comeback plan ... key gains in graphics and video gaming console chips have boosted results and a savvy deal to license server chip designs in China".


### 2017–present: Ryzen

After the initial launch of Zen chips in quarter two 2017, AMD's percentage of the CPU market share surged to nearly 11%. Ryzen CPUs have received favorable reviews from a variety of news outlets, specifically highlighting their high thread counts at prices drastically lower than those of Intel's, especially in the high-performance computing market with AMD's Ryzen Threadripper line of workstation processors. Su is the first woman ever to top the Associated Press’s annual survey of CEO compensation, with her 2019 pay package being valued at $58.5 million.

In February 2022, Su became Chair of AMD after completing a reported $49 billion acquisition of FPGA and programmable systems on chip maker Xilinx.

In 2023, Su's total compensation from AMD was $30.3 million, representing a CEO-to-median worker pay ratio of 238-to-1.
