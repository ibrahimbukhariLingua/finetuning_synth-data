## History

The group was founded in 1993 by Marting Bisang, Jürg Schäppi, Hans-Jörg Graf, Daniel Schlatter and Dieter Albrecht. Martin Bisang is still the largest shareholder. The group early on became an important provider in brokerage and block deals on the Swiss market.

In 2014, Bellevue Group acquired investment funds from Zurich Cantonal Bank: Adamant Biomedical Investments.

The venture capital fund BB Pureos Bioventures founded in 2017 specialises in emerging modalities such as nucleic acid, cell- and gene therapies.

With the acquisition of StarCapital for 30 to 40 million francs in 2016 Bellevue Group wanted to increase its service range and presence in Germany. In 2022 Star Capital was integrated into Bellevue Group with Bellevue's German business entirely managed from Frankfurt from this point on. After former owner Peter Huber had left the company, Assets under Management have been considerably reduced.

As part of restructuring and refocusing, Bellevue Group discontinued its brokerage and corporate finance activities in 2017. The attempts of creating a wealth management department were revised until 2020. In 2020, Bellevue sold its banking operations with underlying assets of CHF 1.6 billion to Quintet private bank and became a pure asset manager. Before that Bellevue had sold its stake in the Swiss stock market SIX to Credit Suisse.

In autumn 2020, investor and billionaire Hansjörg Wyss took a 9.7 percent stake in Bellevue Group. This means that the anchor shareholders (31.6 percent: Martin Bisang, Manuela and Jürg Schäppi) together with the employees (11.4 percent) and Wyss hold the majority of shares in Bellevue Group.

In 2022, Bellevue Group started to expand into Asia through its Singapore office on a systematical basis. Since 2023, Bellevue Group Private Markets started to get active in the Private Equity secondary market.
