# Sompo Japan



**Sompo Japan, Inc.** (損害保険ジャパン株式会社, *Songai Hoken Japan Kabushiki-gaisha*, lit. "General Insurance Japan"), formerly known as **Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Insurance, Inc.** (損害保険ジャパン日本興亜株式会社, *Songai Hoken Japan Nihonkoa*), is a Japanese insurance company. It is the second-largest property insurance company in Japan only behind Tokio Marine, with market share of 19.3% in 2007. As of 2010, the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SOMPO Holdings.

The “Sompo” in the company's name means “general insurance" (損害保険, *songai hoken*) in Japanese, though Sompo Japan offers a range of financial services including life insurance, securities, asset management and venture capital businesses.


## History

**Tokyo Fire Insurance Company, Ltd.** was established in 1887 as Japan's first fire insurance company. The company worked to cultivate an awareness of fire insurance, and five branch offices were added within a year. The major Yokosuka fire of 1890, however, nearly toppled the fledgling company.

In 1893, Japanese entrepreneur Zenjiro Yasuda absorbed the Tokyo Fire Insurance Company into the Yasuda zaibatsu. Later, in 1944, Tokyo Fire Insurance, Imperial Marine Insurance, and First Engine & Boiler Insurance merged to become the **Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Company** (安田火災海上保険).

Yasuda Fire made a successful bid for Van Gogh's "Sunflower" paintings for about 5.3 billion yen in 1987.

On July 1, 2002, Yasuda Fire and Nissan Fire & Marine Insurance (日産火災海上保険) merged into a new company, **Sompo Japan Insurance Inc.**

In December 2002, Sompo Japan acquired Taisei Fire & Marine Insurance.

In September 2014, Sompo Japan acquired Nipponkoa Insurance.

In December 2022, the heirs to the Jewish banker and art collector Paul von Mendelsohn-Bartholdly filed suit in Chicago to reclaim the Van Gogh, alleging that the insurance company ignored the Holocaust-linked history of the painting during its acquisition in 1987.

In 2023, Sompo Japan was implicated in an insurance fraud scandal along with Big Motor, then the largest used car dealer in Japan. According to the Financial Services Agency, despite being alerted to systematic insurance fraud at Big Motor in 2022, Sompo Japan decided to continue business with the dealer, despite two other major insurers suspending business and conducting an investigation. When this investigation confirmed systematic and pervasive insurance fraud at Big Motor, suspicion fell on Sompo Japan due to their close business relationship with Big Motor. On September 19 2023, Sompo Japan's offices in Shinjuku, Tokyo were raided by the Financial Services Agency, and it was revealed that Sompo Japan's management was aware of the fraud but decided to ignore it in exchange for Big Motor prioritizing selling Sompo Japan insurance. After the Financial Services Agency ordered Sompo Japan to improve managerial practices in the wake of the scandal, President Giichi Shirakawa resigned on 26 January 2024, and CEO Kengo Sakurada stepped down in March 2024.
