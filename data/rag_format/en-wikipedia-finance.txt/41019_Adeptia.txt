Adeptia's products are designed to help on-board customer data, implement real-time interfaces between systems, connect with cloud applications, automate business processes, publish APIs, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) integration, and enable Service-oriented architecture (SOA). Adeptia is being used by organizations in various industries including Insurance, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Logistics, Government, Health care, and Retail. Adeptia technology provides Data Integration, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), and Business-to-business (B2B) Integration software capabilities.

Adeptia technology has been developed using Java, XML, and Web Services technologies. They are available in both traditional on-premises and cloud-delivery models. For cloud deployments, Adeptia utilizes the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

Adeptia is notable for enabling business analysts and non-technical users to configure data integrations using a no-code web-browser user interface, rather than developer tool approach, although multiple other vendors now offer similar capabilities.
