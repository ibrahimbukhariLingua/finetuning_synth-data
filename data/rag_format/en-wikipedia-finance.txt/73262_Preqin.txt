## History

Preqin launched as ‘Private Equity Intelligence’ in 2003. Founded by Mark O’Hare and Nick Arnott, it began by listing private equity performance data, relying on the Freedom of Information Act (UK FOIA).

In 2018 the business launched a research report titled Women in Alternatives*,* which detailed underrepresentation of women in the alternative assets industry.

In August 2021, Preqin fully acquired Colmore, a leading private markets technology, services and administration business.

Preqin won The Queen's Award for Enterprise in International Trade in 2016 and 2019, was a national winner at the 2019 European Business Awards, and was named as part of the Sunday Times International Track 200 in the same year.

On July 1, 2024, BlackRock confirmed it would acquire Preqin for £2.55 billion. The plan was to combine Preqin’s data and research tools with Aladdin.
