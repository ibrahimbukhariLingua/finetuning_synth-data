## Benchmarking HPC Clusters

There are numerous suites for examining the performance of a High Performance Computing cluster, including

* ADEPT – 4 suites relating to energy measurements
* HPCC, HPCG, Linpack
* IMB (Intel MPI Benchmark) – gives rates for common MPI-1 point-to-point and collectives
* Mantevo – series of "mini apps" from Sandia National Labs (SNL)
* NAS and NPB
* SHOC – for accelerators
* Stream (memory b/w)
