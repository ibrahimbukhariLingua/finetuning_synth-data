# Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme



The **Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme** (**PTAP**) is a bilateral and multilateral initiative primarily responsible for managing civilian foreign aid to other countries. Established in the 1950s, PTAP administers financial assistance, industrial training, and technical expertise to developing countries that maintain diplomatic relations with Pakistan. The programme benefits 65 countries across the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

To enhance Pakistan's standing in the developing world, PTAP regularly offers educational training and expertise in areas such as commercial banking, railways, steel mills, postal services, and information technology, both domestically and internationally. Its military advisory counterpart, focused on defense cooperation, is limited to nations with historically strong ties to Pakistan.
