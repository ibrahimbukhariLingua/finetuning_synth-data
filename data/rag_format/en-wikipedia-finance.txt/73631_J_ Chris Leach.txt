Leach leads the De Soto Initiative to develop business curricula that highlight the role of business in society. The initiative is based on the work of Hernando de Soto Polar, who has highlighted the role of property rights in reducing poverty in his home country of Peru and other developing economies. The World of Business course created by Leach and colleagues has been adopted at many other universities. The course uses gamification to introduce students to fundamental issues on the role of business: the role of governments and markets, the rule of law, ethical issues in business, diversity and inclusion, and fundamental economic concepts such as the role of trade and “externalities” of business activities on others in society.
