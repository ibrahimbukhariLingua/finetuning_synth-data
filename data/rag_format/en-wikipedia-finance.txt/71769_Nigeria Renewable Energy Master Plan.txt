# Nigeria Renewable Energy Master Plan



The **Nigeria Renewable Energy Master Plan (REMP)** is a policy being implemented by Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Environment that aims to increase the contribution of renewable energy to account for 10% of Nigerian total energy consumption by 2025. The Renewable Energy Masterplan for Nigeria was produced in 2006 with support
from the UNDP.
