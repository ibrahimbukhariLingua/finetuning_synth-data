## History

The origin of Corticeira Amorim dates back to 1870 when a factory for the manufacture of natural cork stoppers for port wine bottling was established. Amorim & Irmãos, a cork manufacturing company incorporated in 1922, was the first member company under the current Corticeira Amorim, SGPS, S.A. umbrella of companies.

In March 2001 António Rios de Amorim succeeded his uncle Américo Amorim as CEO of Corticeira Amorim.

The Department for the Development of New Applications for Cork and Cork Products was established in 2004 with a view to developing and designing new cork solutions as well as strengthening knowledge exchange among the different business units. Investment in R&D was again emphasized in 2007 when the creation of a new across-the-board support business unit designed to meet the innovation challenge was announced: Amorim Cork Research.


## Criticism

Corticeira Amorim suspended all exports to Russia and ceased direct investments in the country following the start of the Ukraine war.
