## History

The Georgia Tech Foundation came into existence in 1932. As the result of a petition for a charter by several prominent alumni, including Y. Frank Freeman ('10), William H. Glenn ('10), Robert Gregg ('05), and Frank Neely ('04), the Georgia Tech Alumni Foundation, Inc. was incorporated in January 1932. Originally formed to sell insurance policies to alumni, in 1950 the organization's charter and bylaws were changed, and in 1954, the organization became known as the Georgia Tech Foundation, Inc.
