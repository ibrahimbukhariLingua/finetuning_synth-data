# Arbejdernes Landsbank



**Arbejdernes Landsbank** (lit. 'National Workers Bank') is a Danish bank founded in 1919 with approximately 250,000 customers and 1,075 employees. It is the 7th largest bank in Denmark. As of 2014 the bank has 70 branches in Denmark.


## History

The bank was founded by Danish trade unions, the Social Democrats and Arbejderkul (union of coal workers) with an initial capital of DKK 2 million, most of which was pledged by Arbejderkul, who were particularly powerful after performing a crucial role in securing Denmark's energy supply during World War I. Although the bank was officially a public company, the shares could not be listed and remained with the labour movement. In practice the bank operated as a cooperative.

During the Great Depression, major shareholder Arbejderkul ran into trouble and the trade union federation joined the ownership of the bank. In the 1960s the bank went through a major growth period, attracting new private customers and many independent branches were opened throughout Denmark.
In 1986, ALFINA was bought and later renamed to AL Finans A/S. The bank also owns a share in Østjydsk Bankᵈᵃ.

As of 2014, the bank has 24,000 private shareholders, although the trade unions remain the major shareholders.
