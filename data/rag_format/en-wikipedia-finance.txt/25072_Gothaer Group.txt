## History


### Foundation

In 1820, Ernst-Wilhelm Arnoldi established the Feuerversicherungsbank des Deutschen Handelsstandes, a company run by merchants, for merchants in the Thuringian town of Gotha. Gothaer was one of Europe's first interregional mutual insurance companies. Soon, after the foundation of the Gothaer Feuerversicherungsbank, other mutual fire insurance companies were founded, such as Versicherungs-Gesellschaft gegen Feuersgefahr and Württembergische Privat-Feuerversicherungs-Gesellschaft.

In 1827 Arnoldi set up a second company, the Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank für Deutschland. In 1830 the Gothaer Feuerbank was renamed Gothaer Feuerversicherungsbank für Deutschland.

In 1842 the company faced its first serious challenge – the Great Fire of Hamburg and its devastating consequences. It started in Eduard Cohen's cigar factory at Deichstraße 42 or 44 early in the morning of 5 May. The huge fire lasted for four days (until 8 May 1842) and destroyed about a third of the old inner city. A large muster of about 1,150 firefighters and numerous volunteers fought this fire. Below the line, 1749 houses, three churches (St. Nikolai, St. Petri, Gertrudkirche) (Hamburg-Uhlenhorst), two synagogues, 102 attics, the town hall and a couple of other public buildings were destroyed. The Great Fire of Hamburg caused damage of about 90 million marks. One of the biggest historical city museums, the Museum für Hamburger Geschichte, has an exhibition on the Great Fire.


#### Developments in the 19th and 20th century (1900–1996)

In 1902, the Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank für Deutschland was renamed Gothaer Lebensversicherungsbank auf Gegenseitigkeit. In the recent decades, until 1918, the Gothaer Group achieved an insurance portfolio of 1.24 billion marks and assets of almost 500 billion marks. However, as a result of World War I, the company struggled for its existence and independence. The war caused inflation, whereby the company's insurance portfolio and assets were devalued. The Gothaer Group managed to cope with this crisis and was able in the period from 1924 to 1944 to establish their insurance portfolio of 1.25 billion marks.

In 1924, the Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherungs AG was set up. Its main task was to handle the emergent motor insurance business, which included accident insurance, liability insurance, transport insurance and automobile insurance. The Gothaer Allgemeine Versicherungs AG was founded by Karls August Friedrich Samwer, the great-grandfather of the Samwer brothers. In cooperation with David Schneider and Robert Gentz, the three Samwer brothers founded the European e-commerce fashion company Zalando.

From 1945 on, the Gothaer Feuer was no longer permitted to conduct business operations. At that critical juncture Gotha was occupied by the Soviet Union. The company finally moved to Cologne on 5 March 1946. After World War II, a joint working group between Gothaer and Dresdner Feuerversicherung was established. In 1946, the portfolios of Dresdner Feuerversicherung were taken over by Gothaer Feuer until 1950. In 1970, the Gothaer Feuerversicherungsbank auf Gegenseitigkeit was renamed to Gothaer Versicherungsbank VVaG. In 1993, Dr. Bernd Meyer took over the management of Gothaer Risk Management GmbH in Cologne. In 1994, IBM took over the data processing centers of Porsche, Continental AG, Air Liquide and Gothaer Insurance.


#### Developments in the 21st century (1997–present)

In 1997, the co-ordination concern Parion was formed, evolved by the Gothaer chief executive Wolfgang Peiner. The brand name Parion was composed of the terms "Parität" and "Union". In 1998, the company Asstel was established as the group's direct insurer. With bonus revenues of 3.9 billion euro in 2000, Parion ranked among to the ten biggest German insurers.

Beginning in 2005, the Gothaer Kunden-Service-Center GmbH (GKC) – with circa 100 employees – was trying to process a large influx of applications.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Apart from the Gothaer Group, other insurance companies also outsourced some of their services. Gothaer acquired MLP Versicherung AG and renamed the company Janitos Versicherung AG in 2005, with its head office in Heidelberg. In 2006, Janitos was well-established in the insurance market. In 2006 the Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG moved its head office from Göttingen to Cologne. In 2010, as part of its strategy of expanding into the growth regions of Central and Eastern Europe, the Gothaer Group acquired an interest in Polish non-life insurer Polskie Towarzystwo Ubezpieczeń S.A (PTU), which was previously held by Polish chemicals company Ciech S.A. and its subsidiaries. In 2012, Gothaer entered the Romanian insurance market by acquiring a majority stake in Platinum Asigurari Reasigurari. In the same year, the Platinum Asigurari Reasigurari was renamed Gothaer Asigurari Reasigurari.

In 2013, there was a change at the top of the group. As of 1 January 2014, Dr Werner Görg stepped down as chief executive; the role was taken over by Dr Karsten Eichmann. In 2014 the Asstel Lebensversicherung AG was amalgamated into Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG. In 2015 Gothaer strengthened their equity basis and gained market share in property insurance.
