## History

The Sparkasse Mittelholstein was created in 1823 under the name *Spar- und Leih-Kasse in Rendsburg* as a foundation savings bank. The foundation's capital was 1,500 *Mark courant*. The founder was Johann Georg Röhling.

In 1847, another predecessor institute was founded, the *Spar- und Leihcasse in Nortorf*. In 1979 it merged with the *Verbandssparkasse Nortorf* to create *Sparkasse Nortorf*. In 1862, the *Hademarscher Spar- und Leihcasse - Verein*, the third predecessor institute was created. It was converted in 1899 into a public limited company and thus forms the origin of the present form of the company.

The current institute was founded in 1991. In 2007, the takeover of the public legally *Sparkasse Büdelsdorf* took place. The city Büdelsdorf, as a sponsor of the former *Sparkasse Büdelsdorf*, received in return shares of the Sparkasse Mittelholstein AG and has since participated in their share capital.
