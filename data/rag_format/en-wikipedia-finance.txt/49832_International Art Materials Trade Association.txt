## Corporate history

The National Art Materials Trade Association was established on January 4, 1950, in Chicago, Illinois. Edward Ellison, editor of the *Art Material Trade News*, saw the need for a unified art materials industry and incorporated NAMTA as a nonprofit trade association, scheduling its first meeting of the board of directors the next month. During governance discussions, Frank Peters of Favor, Ruhl & Co. was elected the first president and Ellison was elected secretary/treasurer. There were 17 members when the organization started. In addition to Ellison and Peters, founding members include Henry Levinson, founder of Liquitex.

The goal of the founders was to create an official trade association that would work together with organizations and individuals to identify areas for business development and improvement, ensuring the perpetual existence of the industry, while working jointly to achieve and maintain a high level of professionalism and profitability.

As of 2012ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, NAMTA represents members in the art and creative material industry in 39 countries around the world. In 2011, the Board of Directors changed the name of the organization from the National Art Materials Trade Association, to the International Art Materials Trade Association, in order to better reflect the scope of its membership. The association chose to retain the use of NAMTA as its official acronym.

In November 2021, AFCI (The Association for Creative Industries) merged with Namta. Expanding the Namta membership to include craft materials, in addition to fine art materials.
