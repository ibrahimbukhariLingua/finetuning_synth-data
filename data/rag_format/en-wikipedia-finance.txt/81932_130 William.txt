130 William


# 130 William



**130 William** is an 800-foot-tall (240 m), residential high-rise tower located in the Financial District of Manhattan. The building was developed by Lightstone and designed by Ghanaian-British architect Sir David Adjaye.


## History

Lightstone purchased the former 12-story office building at 130 William Street in May 2014 for $60 million after the previous owner defaulted on a mortgage from East West Bank. Eight months later, the company unveiled Hill West Architects' plans for a 50-story tall mixed-use building that would reach a height of 581 feet (177 m) and contain a hotel and 188 apartments. However, new plans filed in early 2017 removed the hotel portion and increased the building's size to its current height. The project name was *Wall Street Tower* until in 2017, when the name was changed to *130 William Street*.

In March 2017, the project secured $305 million in financing and began construction. Facade installation began in October 2018. The building topped-out in May 2019. 130 William has also been recognized as the fastest selling luxury condominium development in New York City in 2018 and 2019.

Construction of 130 William was completed in June 2023.


## Architecture and design

130 William's custom hand-cast façade features large-scale arched windows and bronzed detailing. It rises approximately 800 feet (240 m) tall at 66 stories and consists of 242 residences and over 22,000 square feet (2,000 m²) of amenities. The building incorporates a new public plaza park, also designed by Adjaye, as well as over 20,000 square feet (1,900 m²) of retail, both located at the building's base.

130 William is adjacent to the Fulton Center transit hub of the New York City Subway. The building is also immediately adjacent to Tribeca, South Street Seaport, the Brooklyn Bridge.
