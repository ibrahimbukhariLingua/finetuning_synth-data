Regions-Harbert Plaza


# Regions-Harbert Plaza



The **Regions-Harbert Plaza** is a 32-story, 437-foot-tall (133 m) office building in Birmingham, Alabama. Originally known as the **AmSouth-Harbert Plaza**, it was renamed on July 13, 2007, after AmSouth Bancorporation - the building's largest tenant - merged with Birmingham-based Regions Financial Corporation. Today, the 200,000 square feet (19,000 m²) that Regions leases makes it the building's largest tenant.


## History

Designed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, the Plaza was built in 1989 by general contractor Brasfield & Gorrie as a multi-tenant office building for Harbert Corporation. Harbert owned the building until 2008, when the Harbert family sold it.

The building's base has a 70,000-square-foot (6,500 m²) retail center and its foundation can accommodate a 8-story tower above the retail area. The building also connects to the adjacent Regions Center through the mezzanine level.


## Tenants

Major tenants include Regions Financial Corporation; law firms Balch & Bingham, Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP and Maynard Cooper & Gale; an IT Professional Services Firm Insight Global, the accounting firm Ernst & Young and Northwestern Mutual, and a custom clothier, John Armstrong Clothier. The 31st and 32nd floors contain the private City Club of Birmingham.
