# RBC WaterPark Place



**RBC WaterPark Place** is an office complex designed by WZMH Architects and located at 88 Queens Quay West in Toronto, Canada.

Home to the Royal Bank of Canada, it features a 31-storey tower with 930,000 square feet (86,000 m²) of space and developed by Oxford Properties outside the traditional financial core of the city. The tower began construction in 2011 and was completed in 2014. When proposed the building was to have taken over head office operations from Royal Bank Plaza and now houses some of the bank's operations.
