Amana Mutual Funds Trust


# Amana Mutual Funds Trust



**Amana Mutual Funds Trust** (Ticker symbols: AMANX, AMAGX, and AMDWX), headquartered in Bellingham, Washington, is a mutual fund company offering investment products consistent with Islamic banking principles.


## Founding principles

The Amana Income Fund, founded by Unified Management Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, in 1986, was the Trust's first fund. The Amana Growth Fund was created in 1994. The Amana Developing World Fund was created in 2009. All three funds are managed according to Islamic principles.

Traditional mutual funds are off-limits to Muslims, because they typically contain securities that are forbidden by sharia law. Accordingly, the Amana Funds are managed under strict guidelines to comply with Islamic principles. Examples of forbidden (haram) investments are companies that:

* Produce or sell alcohol, tobacco or pornography
* Process or sell pork products
* Generate revenue from gambling or interest (riba)
* Maintain a debt ratio of greater than one-third of assets

The funds were created and are still managed under the value investment style. Nicholas Kaiser has been portfolio manager of the funds since 1990. Scott Klimo is the deputy portfolio manager of the funds.

The Amana Funds are unique in that they were specifically conceived to meet the needs of Muslim investors. One of the reasons Muslims are motivated to save and invest is to make financial preparations necessary to make the *Hajj*, a sacred form of a self-presentation before God (Allah in Arabic) that is considered within Islam to be one of life's primary duties. In order to make the *Hajj*, a Muslim must first get his financial house in order, which presents special challenges if the money is to be invested in compliance *Shari'ah*-oriented financial principles. According to Amana's founding chairman Dr. M. Yaqub Mirza,
