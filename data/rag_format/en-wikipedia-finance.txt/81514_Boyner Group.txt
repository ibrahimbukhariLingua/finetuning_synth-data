Boyner Group


# Boyner Group



**Boyner Group** is one of two major groups, alongside Beymen Group that grew out of the Boyner family textile and clothing manufacturing and retailing enterprises.


## History

Ali Osman Boyner co-founded **Altınyıldız** (**Boyner Holding** today) in 1952 with the idea to introduce Turkish fabric to the world, and started exporting in 1956. At the end of the 1960s, Boyner began manufacturing ready-to-wear clothing to fill a gap in the Turkish market for quality goods. After long research, he planted the first seeds of what would become the upscale department store Beymen, collaborating with friend and fashion designer Kerim Kerimol and Italian fashion house owner Silvano Corsini. Beymen's first store, featuring its own private-label products, opened in 1971 in Şişli, Istanbul. From there, Beymen continued to open new stores and compete with Vakko in the upscale department store business.

Boyner Group thus focused as from 2019 on five businesses as shown in the table below. As of 2024 the Boyner Group brands are organized slightly differently than in 2019.

| **Boyner Büyük Mağazacılık** (**Boyner**): multi-brand retail department stores | |
| **Morhipo**: fashion and multi-brand e-commerce |
| **Hopi**: consumer technologies | |
| **Altınyıldız**: textile production | |
| **Altınyıldız Classics**: men's clothing manufacturing and retail | **BR Mağazacılık** (**Altınyıldız Classics** and **Beymen Business** manufacturing and retail) |
