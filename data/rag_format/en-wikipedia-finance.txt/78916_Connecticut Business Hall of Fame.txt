Connecticut Business Hall of Fame


# Connecticut Business Hall of Fame



The **Connecticut Business Hall of Fame**, established in 2005, is an organization created to feature the accomplishments of companies and business leaders and to promote future business activities in the state of Connecticut in the United States.

Connecticut has often been in competition with the states of Massachusetts and New York. Both Boston and the New York City metro area have attracted better economic development opportunities than Connecticut. In the past, Connecticut officials have fought to keep defense dollars in the state and have started to promote Connecticut's tourism industry to national audiences.

Connecticut has also become the home of two of the world's largest casinos, the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods. These facilities have grown into huge entertainment and resort complexes that pull resources from all over Connecticut and contribute to the region. During 2006, the state slowly announced a couple of economic incentive programs in order to attract national business interest. Through the state legislature, an initiative was passed to provide film production companies with significant tax credits in order to stimulate economic growth. The state also stepped up its involvement with grant and incentive tax breaks to establish several new business and residential development programs including one at the former United Technologies Corporation campus in East Hartford. State government and private companies have also taken the lead in aggressively marketing and promoting minor league sports clubs, as well as college sports including University of Connecticut basketball and football teams.

The Connecticut Business Hall of Fame was created to solidify Connecticut's role in the global business community. Director of the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame, Ron Dresner stated that he intends to build an awareness globally about how Connecticut has contributed to the success of so many businesses throughout the years and how talented business leaders flourished in Connecticut.

Already, the organization has gathered support throughout the state as it has created an extensive monthly business networking program which has featured speakers such as then Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Technology Council President Matthew Nemerson and *Business New Haven* publisher Mitchell Young. Other featured speakers and panelists included business management consultants/authors Charles Miller and Claire Thaine, Goodwin College president Mark Scheinberg, Connecticut First Coalition Director Charles LeConche and Middlesex Chamber of Commerce President Larry McHugh.

During its first year, the organization has attracted over 10,000 regional business professionals to the various networking and industry-specific events that it co-sponsored. From business technology updates for business owners, monthly networking events to sales seminars for managers, the Connecticut Business Hall of Fame has made an impact connecting companies throughout the state.
