## History

Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance was incorporated in September 2007 and commenced operations in February 2009 with Rs. 420 crores in funding from its founding promoters. The company operates in the following segments; life insurance, annuity pension fund and unitised insurance fund.

In June 2016, following the deregulation of the foreign ownership limit that took effect in March 2015, Dai-ichi Life decided to purchase an additional 18% stake in SUD from BOI, bringing its ownership in SUD to 44 percent, as a result of deliberation to increase the shareholding. Later in April 2019, BOI solicited non-binding proposals/bids for the purchase of 6,48,739,64 equity shares representing its 25.05% ownership. The proposed stake sale is part of the bank's efforts to dispose of non-essential assets and raise capital.

As of August 2021, the company does its business through a distribution network that includes 15,000 bank branches and serves more than 9.2 million clients.

In January 2023, the company introduced a new product, the SUD Life century gold, a non-linked, non-participating individual savings life insurance plan with returns and life cover protection.


## Asset under management

As of September 29, 2021, the company's assets under management totaled Rs 15,052 crore and nearly 47% of this amount consisted of securities issued by the central government (34%) or state governments (14%).
