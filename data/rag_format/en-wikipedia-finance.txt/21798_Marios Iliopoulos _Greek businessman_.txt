## Insurance fraud

On 6 July 2011, the tanker ship Brillante Virtuoso was damaged beyond repair in what the High Court of London ruled was insurance fraud orchestrated and instigated by Marios Iliopoulos, disguised as a pirate attack.
An investigator into the matter, David Mockett, was killed by a car bomb in what has been described as a targeted assassination after he had made clear that he disagreed with Iliopoulos' insurance claim.

It was also found that another tanker owned by Iliopoulos, Elli, was similarly written off after a fire two years prior with the same salvage companies and chief engineer in charge of that recovery operation as were in charge of the Brillant Virtuoso.
