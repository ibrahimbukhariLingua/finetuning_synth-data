Born to a Jewish family, Malkin graduated with an A.B. from Harvard College (*summa cum laude*, Phi Beta Kappa) in 1955; and in 1958, he graduated with a J.D. from Harvard Law School (*magna cum laude*). In 1958, he joined the law firm of his father-in-law Lawrence Wien as a partner (renamed Wien & Malkin LLP). His father-in-law had pioneered the concept of real estate syndicates in 1930s making the direct ownership of income property accessible to groups of individual investors for the first time. Malkin helped to expand Wien's already substantial portfolio, which included many prominent New York City buildings including the Empire State Building (which they jointly bought in 1961 with Harry Helmsley from Henry Crown), the Equitable Building, the Graybar Building, the Fisk Building, the Garment Centre Capitol Building, the Toy Center, and the Lincoln Building at One Grand Central Place. They also bought many prominent hotels including the Plaza Hotel, the Taft Hotel, Hotel St. Moritz, the Lexington Hotel, and the Hotel Governor Clinton. Malkin also helped to expand the firm's activities to Newark, Palm Beach, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Las Vegas.

In 2013, Peter Malkin and his son Anthony raised $930 million from the secondary offering and IPO of 18 buildings in their portfolio including the Empire State Building. Peter Malkin became chairman emeritus and Anthony became chairman, president, and CEO. The new publicly traded entity is named the Empire State Realty Trust (ticker ESRT). Prior to the IPO, the family firm, Wien and Malkin, was renamed Malkin Holdings.
