# Vestiaire Collective



**Vestiaire Collective** is a global platform for buying and selling pre-owned luxury and designer fashion. It follows a sustainability-focused approach called "Think First, Buy Second," which encourages conscious shopping. The platform connects buyers and sellers of secondhand luxury and designer items, with listings digitally verified and curated by an internal team supported by AI. Buyers can choose physical authentication through international hubs or opt for direct shipping.


## History

Vestiaire Collective was founded in 2009 as "Vestiaire de Copines" by Fanny Moizant, Sophie Hersan, Sébastien Fabre, Alexandre Cognard, Henrique Fernandes, and Christian Jorge. The platform launched with 3,000 pre-owned fashion items sourced from friends and family. In 2012, the company rebranded to "Vestiaire Collective" and began expanding internationally.

Vestiaire Collective started operations in the United Kingdom in 2012, followed by its expansion into the United States in 2014. The company continued its international growth, reaching various European markets in 2015 and further expanding to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia by 2017. Today, Vestiaire Collective operates in over 70 countries worldwide.

In 2019, Maximilian Bittner became the Global CEO, with a focus on increasing the company's presence in the US market. Maximilian Bittner is a tech entrepreneur and CEO of Vestiaire Collective. He started his career at Morgan Stanley’s Investment Banking division in London prior to joining McKinsey & Company in Germany. Bittner founded Lazada Group, the main online shopping destination in Southeast Asia, in 2012.

In 2022, Vestiaire Collective began a three-year plan to ban 63 fast fashion brands, with 30 banned in 2022 and 33 in 2023. The goal is to raise awareness about textile waste and overconsumption. The company, with help from experts, defined fast fashion based on factors like low prices, frequent collections, large product ranges, quick production, and heavy promotion.

By November 2023, Vestiaire Collective's valuation reached €1.1 billion, following a financing round.

In December 2023, Vestiaire Collective's cofounders Fanny Moizant and Sophie Hersan were awarded the "National Order of Merit" by the French Ministry of the Economy.

## Operations

Vestiaire Collective's operations are built around four pillars: Fashion, Trust, Community, and Impact.

* Fashion: Vestiaire Collective offers a curated selection of fashion items, with 30,000 new listings added daily and over 5 million items available on the platform. Since 2021, the company has collaborated with luxury industry players through its "Resale as a Service" program, promoting sustainable fashion. By July 2024, the platform had established 12 partnerships with brands such as Gucci, Chloé, Burberry, and Isabel Marant, in addition to earlier partnerships with Alexander McQueen, Mulberry, and others.
* Trust: Vestiaire Collective has authenticated over 2.5 million items since 2009, with the help of 140 experts across six authentication centers. The company also launched a training program in 2017 to further enhance authentication expertise. Vestiaire Collective is a signatory of the French Anti-Counterfeiting Charter (2012) and the European Commission's Memorandum of Understanding to Combat Online Counterfeiting (April 2024), aimed at addressing counterfeit goods.
* Community: Vestiaire Collective operates in 70 countries, fostering a global community of fashion enthusiasts. The platform's users are focused on buying fewer, higher-quality items, with 85% of consumers expressing a preference for this approach.
* Impact: The company promotes circular fashion to minimize environmental impact, reducing 90% of the environmental costs associated with purchasing new items. Despite business growth, the company reduced its carbon intensity and absolute emissions by 6% in 2023 compared to 2022.

Vestiaire Collective's 2024 Circularity Report, "Exposing the True Cost of Fast Fashion," outlines the environmental and financial downsides of fast fashion, noting that these items are often worn less and discarded quickly. The report suggests that pre-owned luxury fashion is 33% more cost-effective over time and has a lower environmental impact. Vestiaire Collective's circular model is reported to prevent three times more emissions than it produces, contributing to a positive environmental effect.
