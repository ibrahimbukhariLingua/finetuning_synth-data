## History

In 1997, Brill sold ALM to Time Warner, mainly for its CourtTV stake. ALM's legal publications were acquired from Time Warner by U.S. Equity Partners, L.P., a private equity fund sponsored by Wasserstein & Co., L.P., in 1998. Shortly afterward, it acquired National Law Publishing Company (parent of *The National Law Journal* and *New York Law Journal*) from Boston Ventures and the legal publications of Legal Communications (including *The Legal Intelligencer*) from Meridian Venture Partners.

In 1999, U.S. Equity bought real estate publisher Schein Publications.

In 2007, ALM was purchased by Incisive Media for US$630 million. Two years later, Incisive had to restructure the loan used to purchase ALM, and ALM once again became an independent company, owned by the lenders and Apax Partners. Wasserstein & Co. repurchased ALM in 2014.

In 2015, ALM acquired Summit Professional Networks.

In January 2016, the company acquired British legal magazine *Legal Week*.
