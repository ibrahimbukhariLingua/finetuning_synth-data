## Controversies


### Allegations of fraud and money laundering

Blord has faced multiple legal challenges. In July 2024, Linus Williams was arrested by the Nigerian Police following allegations of cryptocurrency fraud, internet-related crimes, and terrorism funding. The charges also include aiding internet fraud and money laundering through his cryptocurrency ventures. His arrest came after complaints were lodged against his companies, leading to an investigation by the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID). The charges involved alleged non-compliance with financial regulations, particularly in relation to his cryptocurrency trading platforms. Although the police have yet to complete their investigation, Blord has maintained his innocence, claiming that his businesses operate within the bounds of the law.


### Previous legal issues

In 2022, he was arrested by Nigeriaâ€™s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over accusations of internet fraud. Following a court case, Blord was acquitted, and the EFCC was ordered to return his seized assets, including luxury vehicles that had been impounded during the investigation. Blord celebrated this victory on social media, emphasizing that the legal ruling exonerated him from any wrongdoing.


### Ongoing investigations

As of mid-2024, the investigations into Blord's businesses are still ongoing, with the police and regulatory authorities looking into the complaints against him.
