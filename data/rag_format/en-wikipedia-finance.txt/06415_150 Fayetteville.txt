## History

In 1999, DRA Advisors bought First Union Capitol Center.

After the merger of First Union and Wachovia, Wachovia moved out of its 11-story 110,000 square feet (10,000 m²) building built in 1961.

On January 31, 2007, Argus Realty Investors LP of San Clemente, California paid $153.4 million for Wachovia Capitol Center and its parking deck, plus retail space across the street. The amount was the most ever paid for a Triangle office building. At the time, Wachovia occupied 105,788 square feet (9,828.0 m²), and other major tenants included Deloitte & Touche, PriceWaterhouse Coopers, Merrill Lynch, and KPMG, as well as the city's largest law firm Smith Anderson Blount.

As a result of six transactions, HighBrook Investors paid $42.74 million for 31.57 percent of Wells Fargo Capitol Center, whose ownership is a tenants in common structure. As of December 4, 2015, the building had 192,181 square feet (17,854.2 m²) of leasable space available, with 20,451 square feet (1,900.0 m²) more expected in 2016.
