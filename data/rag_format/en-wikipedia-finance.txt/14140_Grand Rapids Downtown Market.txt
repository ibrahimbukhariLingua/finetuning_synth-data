Grand Rapids Downtown Market


# Grand Rapids Downtown Market



The **Grand Rapids Downtown Market** is a public market in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Opened in 2013, the market currently has over twenty tenants present and can host over fifty outdoor vendors for a farmers market.


## History

Beginning in the 1990s, Grand Rapids began to experience renewed growth following a partnership between local wealthy philanthropists and the city, especially with the creation of non-profit Grand Action, which focused on downtown development. In 2010, Market Ventures performed a feasibility study that supported the construction of a market in Grand Rapids citing the presence of over 12,000 farms located in surrounding counties, with inspiration for the market being drawn from Eastern Market, Faneuil Hall, markets in Grand Central Station and San Francisco Ferry Building.

Recognized as the first LEED Gold certified market in the United States, it was designed by Hugh A. Boyd Architects and cost $32 million ($40,201,143 in 2022). Many of the materials present in the market were reused from previous structures that existed on the property. Ground source heat pumps also provide heat for the structure while outdoors, a snowmelt system exists on the ground to maintain safe and convenient use during colder seasons.

The Grand Rapids Downtown Market opened on September 2, 2013, and attracted 30,000 people on its opening day. One of its first vendors was Tacos El Cuñado. In its first year, the market experienced $5 million in sales. In 2015, Slows Bar BQ entered as an anchor tenant, leaving the market in 2023. In November 2023, the market announced the opening of a Christkindl Markt that has food vendors, a German-style beverage hall, live entertainment and curling lessons.


## Layout and operation

Located on a 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) site adjacent to U.S. Route 131, the Grand Rapids Downtown Market has a three-story, 132,000 square feet (12,300 m²) building with 24 permanent spaces for indoor vendors and an outdoor canopy providing 52 stalls for a farmers' market. Some vendors at the market accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) food stamps to assist low income individuals.

At the ground level, windows provide visibility to various vendors by the passerby. This first level has a bakery, butcher, chocolatier, grocers and dining options. On the second floor, commercial-grade kitchens exists to help incubate new businesses and to educate students. The educational kitchen, which is used for cooking and nutrition classes, has counters placed on hydraulics that can be lowered to provide increased accessibility. Food storage, event spaces and a two-story greenhouse are also located on the second floor. Office space is available for start-up companies to lease on the third floor. Indoor furnishings are provided locally from Steelcase.
