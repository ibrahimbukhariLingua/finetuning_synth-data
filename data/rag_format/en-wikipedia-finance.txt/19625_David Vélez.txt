## Early life and education

Vélez was born in Medellín in 1981, but his family fled cartel violence when he was nine years old and migrated to Costa Rica. Vélez visited a German school in Costa Rica.

## Career

After graduating, Vélez worked at General Atlantic in Brazil and then got a job as an analyst at financial service company Morgan Stanley. He also worked at Goldman Sachs and Sequoia Capital.


### Nubank

The idea for Nubank came about when Vélez needed to open a bank account in Brazil. To do so, he had to keep his bag in a locker and even then the revolving door locked, trapping him at the entrance to the branch. When he needed a manager, he was kept waiting for a long time and the document requirements were very bureaucratic because he was a foreigner. After he finally managed to open an account, he noticed that everything was very expensive, with high fees for simple services. That's when he thought of creating a bank using technology, taking advantage of smartphones used for other services in Brazil. He founded the online bank Nubank in 2013 together with Brazilian Cristina Junqueira and the American Edward Wible.

The company started with him and his employees as the first customers. The startup went on to receive investments from Sequoia and Khosla Ventures.

He founded his first Nubank branch abroad at the end of 2017, in Berlin, Germany. In 2019, Nubank had over 12 million customers. In 2023, the number of customers had risen to 90 million people in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.

In September 2024, the Congress of the Republic of Colombia honored him with the Simón Bolívar Order of Democracy, conferred at the rank of Grand Knight, in recognition of his entrepreneurial achievements.
