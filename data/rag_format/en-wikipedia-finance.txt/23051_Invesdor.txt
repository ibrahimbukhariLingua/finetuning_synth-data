## Business model

Invesdor focuses on equity crowdfunding for startups and growth companies. Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and UK companies can raise up to 2.5 million euros through Invesdor, while investments can come from anywhere in the world. The minimum for each investment is 20 euros.

The service follows the “All-or-Nothing” model, in which pledged funds are only collected from the investors if the minimum goal set by the company being funded is reached by the end of the crowdfunding campaign.

The company seeks to position their service as a low-threshold option by having a low minimum investment and a general scarcity of paperwork during the process.
