On return to the UK, Robinson was appointed CEO of Velocix, formerly CacheLogic (2007 – 2008), a Venture Capital backed video content delivery network, on the internet. Robinson's remit was to commercialise the proposition, bring the product to market and begin selling to new customers. He initiated a partnership with Verizon and early trials with the BBC for its recently launched iPlayer. However, after 18 months of increasing video delivery traffic on the network, Robinson clashed with investors over product investment levels, and resigned. The business was then sold to Alcatel Lucent.

He was responsible for its Accountancy Software Division, and lead the spin-out of the Accountancy business, from the Group in 2011. Through the sale of the business by Hellman Friedman to Hg, the new company inherited the use of the IRIS brand, and operated as an independent business, to the former Group. As CEO Robinson tripled the size of the business over four years through organic growth and M&A. In 2016 Robinson was appointed chair of the business and worked alongside this as an Operating Partner for Hg. This role included a stint as Interim CEO of Achilles.
