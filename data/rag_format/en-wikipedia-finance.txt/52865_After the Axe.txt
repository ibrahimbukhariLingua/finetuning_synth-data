## Reception

Writing in *Cinema Canada*, Gary Lamphier stated that Gunnarsson and Lucas "establish Biff's decline and subsequent resurrection with economy and a sense of style."

It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Despite its Oscar nomination in the documentary category, *After the Axe* is closer to a docufiction film, made with the cooperation of members of the Canadian business community, which provided locations and helped script scenes during filming. The film's protagonist, D.R. "Biff" Wilson, is a composite character based on the filmmakers' conversations with fired executives, while the other Canadian executives play themselves.
