Stock exchanges of small economies


# Stock exchanges of small economies



A **Stock exchange** is a corporation or mutual organization which provides facilities for stockbrokers and traders to trade stocks and other securities. It may be a physical trading room where the traders gather, or a formalised communications network.
Creation of a stock exchange is a strategy of economic development: it provides a means of raising capital for investment.
Stock markets may enhance economic activity through the creation of liquidity: a liquid equity market makes investment more attractive because it allows individuals to acquire equity and when required to sell it quickly and cheaply. At the same time, companies enjoy permanent access to capital raised through equity issues.
It has been found that countries that open stock markets grow faster, on average, than the control groups.

An alternative view is that market liquidity may also hurt economic growth, because it encourages short-termism. A downside of raising capital on a stock exchange is that it may result in loss of company control, typically to powerful large investors. Foreign ownership of securities and assets is often unappealing. Extremely low income levels keep share ownership beyond the reach of most people in developing countries.

Countries without a stock exchange include Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Mongolian Stock Exchange as of 2006ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ was the world's smallest stock exchange by market capitalisation.

The trading floor is now open six hours a week.

Trading is done with pen and paper. Buyers shout at or call into their brokers, who stand their white dry-erase boards that list each company's share buy and sell price. This continues despite plans to implement electronic trading.

Trading was suspended for several months in 2006 due to violence, and is subject to power outages.
