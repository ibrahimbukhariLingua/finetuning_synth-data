Vietnamese one-hundred-dong bill


# Vietnamese one-hundred-dong bill



The **Vietnamese one-hundred dong bill** (Vietnamese: 100 đồng), is a denomination of Vietnamese currency. The bill technically remains in circulation, however due to its low value (roughly $0.004 USD) it is rarely ever used for transactions. The bill is largely seen as a collectible or an oddity, with it often selling for many times its original face value.

The back side of the bill depicts Phổ Minh Temple, an ancient Buddhist temple in Nam Định province
