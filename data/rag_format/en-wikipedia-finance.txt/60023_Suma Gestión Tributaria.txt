**Suma Gestión Tributaria** (Suma) is a 100% public provincial agency set up by the Provincial Council of Alicante (Spain) in 1990. It specializes in tax administration: assessment, billing, collection and enforcement. Suma collects the taxes on behalf of each city council with own resources.

Its governing body is the Board of Suma, made up of the Executive Director, 7 to 11 Provincial Representatives and it is chaired by the President of the Provincial Council. There is, in addition, a consultative body, called the Council of Mayors, which guarantees the participation of the delegating Town Councils in the strategies adopted by Suma.

The name, Suma (meaning addition), seeks to express a concept of integration, accumulation, growth, and incorporation. In line with this name, it has developed a corporative culture based on the principle of quality services for the rate-payer and lower costs for the municipalities.


## Location.

Suma operates in Spain, more specifically in Alicante, one of the 3 provinces which make up the Valencian Community,
together with Valencia and Castellon.


## Activities

Suma is the local agency responsible for the application of local taxes in all town councils of the Alicante Province. Suma is in fact an advance shared-services scheme based on the economies of scale principle.

Suma performs an integrated tax management service. It is responsible for the processing of local taxes from the first instance of a taxable activity or property to the receipt of tax payment by the municipal authorities. This involves a number of activities: updating the various payment lists, communicating with customers by issuing bills, collecting the taxes by several means (direct debit, credit card). It is also responsible for the enforcement, from notification to selling assets in auction following legal proceedings of the Taxation Act. Suma can also resolve claims and appeals which arise in the collection process, inspect and monitor the proper declaration and payment of taxes. The collected revenue is deposited in the municipal accounts in a monthly basis.

It has delegated powers for the following taxes and fees:

* Property Tax (IBI).
* Economic Activities Tax (IAE).
* Motor Vehicle Tax (IVTM).
* Capital Gains on Land (IIVTNU).
* Tax on Constructions Installations and Works (ICIO).
* Road Traffic Fines.
* As well as other local fees specific to each municipal authority (Waste Disposal Fee, Sewage, Garage Entrances, etc.)
