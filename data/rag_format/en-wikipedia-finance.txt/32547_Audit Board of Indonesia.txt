Audit Board of Indonesia


# Audit Board of Indonesia



The **Audit Board of Indonesia** (Indonesian: *Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan Republik Indonesia*, lit. 'Financial Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia') is a high state body in Indonesia which is responsible for evaluation of management and accountability of state finances conducted by the central government, local governments, Bank Indonesia, state-owned enterprises, the Public Service Board, and institutions or other entities which manage state finances.


## History

The body was initially established under the name *National Supervision Board* at Magelang, Central Java during the United States of Indonesia period on 28 December 1946. The Board currently functions under the latest revision to the laws governing it dating to 2006. The Board has increasingly tackled environmental issues, revealing in 2014 that the Ciliwung River had been polluted by seventeen separate companies, submitting its report to the police.

As of 2015, the Audit Board of Indonesia was chairing the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions' Working Group on Environmental Auditing.

In 2016, Board chairman Harry Azhar Azis was implicated in the Panama Papers due to a previously registered blank company which he hadn't reported. Azis claimed that the company was merely a registered name on paper which he had started for his oldest daughter, but then sold to someone else after his appointment as Board chairman in December 2014.
