**Jeffrey Maurice Sterling, Baron Sterling of Plaistow**, GCVO, CBE (born 27 December 1934 in Stepney, London) is a British businessman and Conservative peer. The Plaistow referred to is Plaistow, West Sussex, reflected in the land holdings in the county.


## Career

Sterling founded Motability, a charity which, amongst other initiatives, oversees the Motability Scheme in providing cars for people with disabilities, in 1977 and today is currently Life President of the organisation. He was executive chairman of the shipping line P&O from 1983 to 2005, having joined the board as a non-executive director on 6 February 1980, and is now Life President of P&O Cruises. In 2002 he served as chairman of the Golden Jubilee Weekend Trust, in commemoration of The Queen's reign of 50 years as sovereign.

In March 2007 Sterling announced that he would be buying the Swan Hellenic brand from Carnival Corporation & plc. In April 2007 he brokered a deal with Roger Allard's All Leisure Holidays, operator of cruise company Voyages of Discovery, to purchase the brand Swan Hellenic. Together they acquired cruise ship Explorer 2, to be renamed Minerva 1. Swan Hellenic began its new summer season in March 2008 with Lord Sterling remaining as chairman.

In October 2010 Sterling said that cruise passengers using Swan Hellenic at Portsmouth should not mix with "ordinary" ferry passengers who were mostly "semi-lager louts" or "lorry drivers smelling of BO". He later said that he meant 'backpackers' or 'people rushing around'.

He led the initiative to build the Queen's Row Barge *Gloriana* in 2012.
