**ChromaDex** is a dietary supplement and food ingredient company based in Los Angeles, California founded in 1999 that is publicly traded on the NASDAQ.

In 2011, ChromaDex licensed patents from Dartmouth College, Cornell University, and Washington University in St. Louis regarding nicotinamide riboside, which it markets and sells as an ingredient under the brand name Niagen. ChromaDex licensed patents from the University of Mississippi and the USDA to commercially develop pterostilbene and sell the compound under the brand name pTeroPure. ChromaDex no longer sells pTeroPure.


## History

Founded in 1999 by Frank Jaksch, ChromaDex first acquired licensed Dartmouth patents on nicotinamide riboside in 2012, leading to the commercialization of Niagen in 2013.

ChromaDex is traded on the NASDAQ (as CDXC) as of April 2016 and was added to the U.S. Small Cap Russell 2000 Index in June 2018.

In 2017, the company acquired HealthSpan Research LLC and its product Tru Niagen, a standalone nicotinamide riboside supplement, sold direct to U.S. consumers. Also in 2017, ChromaDex raised $48 million to support research and development.
