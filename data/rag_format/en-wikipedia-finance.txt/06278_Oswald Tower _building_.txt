Oswald Tower (building)


# Oswald Tower (building)



The **Oswald Tower** is a skyscraper in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, formerly known as the **Ernst & Young Tower**. It stands on the east bank of the Flats completed in 2013. It is an example of post-modern glass curtain and steel studded construction. The building rises 23 stories to a height of 330 feet (100 m) and offers 480,000 square feet (45,000 m²) of office space.

The major tenant was previously the accounting firm Ernst & Young, which moved from the Huntington Bank Building to the new and then-namesake tower in 2013. Ernst & Young traces its roots back to the firm of Ernst & Ernst, which was established in 1903 in Cleveland. E & Y moved to the North Point Tower in 2023.


## Tenants

The building is also the Cleveland office of these law firms: Cleveland-based Tucker Ellis, and Columbus, Ohio-based Porter Wright Morris Arthur.

In addition to these major tenants the tower was home to the former Cleveland-based metal chemical company OM Group which changed its name to Vectra in 2017 then moved its Headquarters to St. Louis, and is the Cleveland office of San Francisco-based financial corporation Wells Fargo. The tower has an attached Aloft Hotels-branded hotel with 150 guest rooms and the WXYZ bar.
