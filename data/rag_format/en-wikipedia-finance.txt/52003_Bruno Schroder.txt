## Personal life

In 1969, Schroder married Piffa Holt. Before their divorce, they were the parents of a daughter:

* Leonie Schroder. In August 2018, Schroders were considering offering his daughter Leonie Schroder his seat on the main board, which he had held since 1963, when he stepped down. Schroder and his daughter were both on the board of the Dunlossit and Islay Community Trust.

His second wife was Danish-born Baroness Suzanne von Maltzahn (*née* Reventlow-Mourier). They divided the estate on Islay with Piffa who has her own part of the estate and is in residence when Schroder was in London.

Schroder flew his private plane and was a keen breeder of Middle White pigs on the Dunlossit Estate. Schroder funded the Islay lifeboat and sponsored the island's Highland games, the Argyllshire Gathering. Schroder also helped restore an old whisky distillery on Islay. Schroder was one of a number of wealthy individuals who cashed a cheque for 97 pence sent to them by *Bizarre* magazine in 2001.

He died on 20 February 2019, aged 86, "after a short illness".
