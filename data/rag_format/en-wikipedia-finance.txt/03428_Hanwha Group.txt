In the same time period, the Korea Explosives Co. started producing nitroglycerin, which gave it a monopoly in the field of explosives and gunpowder. In 1959, the Hanwha group started producing domestic dynamite.

From 1964 to 1980 the Hanwha group started to make investments in various fields, starting the foundation of it becoming a chaebol. Later in the mid 1960s, Korea Hwasung industrial Co. was founded (now Hanwha Solutions), and entered the petrochemical market. Hanwha increased its competitiveness in the machinery market by acquiring Shinhan Bearing Industrial.
