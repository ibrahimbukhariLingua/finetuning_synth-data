## History

*CoinDesk* was founded by entrepreneur Shakil Khan and began publishing in May 2013. Khan is also an investor in BitPay, a bitcoin payment processor.

At the start of 2016, *CoinDesk* was acquired by Digital Currency Group for an estimated US$500,000–600,000. The next year, in 2017, the company acquired blockchain data and research platform Lawnmower. In 2021 the company acquired cryptocurrency data analytics firm TradeBlock.

In December 2017, CoinDesk established *CoinDesk* Korea in collaboration with the 22nd Century Media Co., subsidiary of Hankyoreh Co., Ltd. to provide blockchain news service in South Korea.

In November 2022, *CoinDesk* reported that FTX's partner firm Alameda Research held a significant portion of its assets in FTX's native token FTT. The news led to a bank run and liquidity crisis at FTX, culminating in FTX filing for bankruptcy protection.

In November 2023, CoinDesk was acquired by Bullish Global, run by Tom Farley, a former New York Stock Exchange president. It operates a cryptocurrency exchange.


## CoinDesk TV

CoinDesk TV is an online video channel which produce live news program everyday. The channel produces daily and weekly shows including "First Mover", "The Hash", "All About Bitcoin", "Word On The Block" and so on.


## Consensus Event

## Bitcoin Price Index

The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (CoinDesk BPI) was launched in September 2013. The Bitcoin Price Index is an average of bitcoin prices across bitcoin exchanges, and began by using price data from Bitstamp, BTC-e and CampBX. Although Mt. Gox data was not used initially, due to withdrawal concerns for US customers, in November 2013, Mt. Gox was added to the BPI due to "a reduction in the risk premium and the option of additional deposit/withdrawal methods". The Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange was eventually removed from the index in February 2014 after its "persistent failure to meet the index's standards for inclusion".

The index was restored to an average of three exchanges in March 2014 with the inclusion of Bitfinex price data, according to CoinDesk: "Since the decline of Mt. Gox, we have observed that Bitfinex has been able to sustain a dramatic increase in its share of the total volume of U.S. dollar-denominated bitcoins traded".ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

The aim of the report is: *to provide an overview of key cryptocurrency trends, challenges, and opportunities, while also highlighting the most important developments over the last year*. A follow-up report in Q2 2014 highlighted that venture capital investment in bitcoin companies was up 28 percent compared to the previous quarter, and that VC investment was pouring into European Bitcoin startups.
