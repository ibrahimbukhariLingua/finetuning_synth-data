# Wantitall.co.za



**WantItAll.co.za** is an online shop based in Johannesburg, South Africa that sells over 14 million products. Founded in 2006 by Justin Drennan, Ryan Drennan and Terence Murphy, the company received venture capital and investment from entrepreneurs David Frankel (entrepreneur) and Ronnie Apteker. WantItAll is ranked as the third largest web store in South Africa in terms of sales and the second largest in terms of visitors as per Alexa Internet rankings, with 200 000 customers and over 150 000 products shipped from the US to South Africa.


## International expansion

With the backing of angel investors, WantItAll.co.za has expanded into the Brazilian market with CompreUS.com, which translates to "Buy US" in Portuguese.


## South African expansion

In April 2013, Wantitall invested in online design retailer Citymob.co.za, allowing Citymob to upscale and increase its product offering, as it will have a better distribution system. Subsequent to the investment, citymob was rebranded to superbalist.com

In November 2014 Wantitall launched an outsourced warehouse and logistics business parcelninja.co.za, which attracted R20M investment from C5 Holdings in the United Kingdom.


## Walmart connection

WantItAll.co.za has been tasked to operate and manage the online shop for South Africa's largest cash and carry (sales) distributor Makro, called Makroshop.co.za. Makro in South Africa is part of Massmart which has just been acquired by the world's largest public corporation by revenue Walmart.

In 2014, Walmart partnered with wantitall.co.za to develop makro.co.za


## Amazon

WantItAll formed a strategic partnership with Amazon.com to stock their entire product catalogue partly because Amazon "blacklisted" the South African Post Office for deliveries.
