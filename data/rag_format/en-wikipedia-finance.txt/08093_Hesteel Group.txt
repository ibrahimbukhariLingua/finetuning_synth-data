Hesteel Group


# Hesteel Group



**Hesteel Group Company Limited** is a Chinese iron and steel manufacturing conglomerate, also known as **Hesteel Group** or its pinyin shortname **Hegang**. The company was also known as **Hebei Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd.** or **HBIS** until 2016 (Chinese: 河北钢铁集团有限公司).

Hesteel Group is the second-largest steel producer in the world measured by crude steel output (after European-Indian conglomerate ArcelorMittal) in 2015, according to the World Steel Association (Chinese companies data was provided by China Iron and Steel Association). After the announcement of the merger of Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) in September 2016, Baowu Steel Group's pro forma production volume in 2015 would be the second in the world, exceeding Hesteel Group. However, Hesteel Group, Baosteel Group and WISCO all announced the cut in production capacity, in response to the market demand and government policy, thus the final ranking could not be predicted.

By net assets, Baosteel Group's subsidiary was already exceeding the net assets of Hesteel Group as of 31 December 2015.

Hesteel Group had a second-tier subsidiary listed at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Hesteel Company, which is controlled by the direct subsidiaries Hansteel Group and Tangsteel Group of Hesteel Group.
