## Controversy

After several of USC Professor Greg Patton's students complained to the university about the professor using a common Chinese Mandarin filler word during academic lecture that equated to the English word "that", which the students mistook for a racial pejorative, Geoffrey Garrett advised students that the professor would no longer be teaching the course. "It is simply unacceptable for the faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students", he said. Other USC students backed Prof Greg Patton's academic use of the word, with many on social media noting that Prof Patton's punishment appeared to be discrimination against speakers of Chinese.
