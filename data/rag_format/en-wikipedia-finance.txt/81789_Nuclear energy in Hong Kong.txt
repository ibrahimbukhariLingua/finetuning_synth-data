## Carbon emission mitigation

To reduce the carbon dioxide emission in Hong Kong, new coal-fired power plants have not been allowed to be built anymore since 1997. The government of Hong Kong have been trying to boost the share of renewable energy, natural gas and nuclear energy for power generation in Hong Kong. The current existing coal-fired power plants will be kept on low utilization as reserve.

The government itself plan to cut carbon emission up to 50-60% from the current emission by 2020 by gradually replacing coal-based power generation with more nuclear power and other green energy.
