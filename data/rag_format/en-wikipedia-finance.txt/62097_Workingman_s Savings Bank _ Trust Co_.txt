## History and architectural features

Formerly a Mellon Bank until 1971, this building was sold to the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh with plans to convert it to a church; however, the expense of the project proved too costly and it was instead donated to the ARC House rehabilitation center network. The building was used as its headquarters from 1976 to 2006. It is currently vacant.

It was added to the List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations on March 10, 2009.
