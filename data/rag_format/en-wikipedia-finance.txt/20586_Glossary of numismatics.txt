Numismatics (ancient Greek: νομισματική, meaning "monetary") is the scientific study of money and its history in all its varied forms. While numismatists are often characterized as studying coins, the discipline also includes the study of other types of money, such as banknotes, stock certificates, medals, medallions, and tokens (also referred to as exonumia).

Sub-fields and related fields of numismatics include:

* Exonumia, the study of coin-like objects such as token coins and medals, and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration.
* Notaphily, the study of paper money or banknotes.
* Philately, the study of postage stamps.
* Scripophily, the study and collection of stocks and bonds.
