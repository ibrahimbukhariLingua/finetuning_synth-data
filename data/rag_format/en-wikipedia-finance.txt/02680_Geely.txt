## History

Geely was established in 1986 in Ningbo, Zhejiang by Li Shufu as a refrigerator parts manufacturer located in Taizhou, Zhejiang. To start the company, Li Shufu had to borrow funds from his family. In 1994, Geely transitioned into the motorcycle industry by acquiring a state-run firm, and started producing China's first scooter.

In 1997, Geely completed the construction of relevant factories and initial investment preparations to enter the automobile industry. This made Geely the first private automobile company in China, whereas other carmakers are state-owned enterprises such as Chery. Geely's first car, the Geely Haoqing, rolled off the assembly line in Linhai, Zhejiang on 8 August 1998. However, Geely did not obtain its national production license until 9 November 2001, which delayed mass production until 2002. By 2002, the brand was ranked among the top ten in the Chinese automobile market.

In 2002, Geely was restructured from being a family-operated entity to a joint-stock company managed by professional management. On 24 March 2003, **Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd.** (ZGH) was established with a registered capital of CN¥930 million. In January 2004, Li Shufu bought controlling shares in Guorun Holdings Co., Ltd., a company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under the trading code 0175HK. In March 2004, Guorun was renamed Geely Automobile Holdings Limited, a company under ZGH, retaining the same trading code. This strategy was seen as Geely's "backdoor" entry into the Hong Kong stock market, providing a means to raise funds for the company.

In 2006, Geely bought a 19.97 percent equity stake in British company Manganese Bronze Holdings, the manufacturer of London black cabs. Both companies started a £53 million joint venture to produce the black cabs in China, with Geely holding 52 percent and the British company 48 percent. The company has since reduced costs by producing parts in China. In February 2013, ZGH fully acquired Manganese Bronze Holdings for £11.04 million, after the British company entered administration due to lack of funding. ZGH established a new company under its British subsidiary called The London Taxi Corporation, later renamed London Electric Vehicle Company, to resume assembly of the London black cab in Coventry, UK.

In 2009, Geely bought an Australian transmission company Drivetrain Systems International (DSI), at that time the second largest automatic transmission manufacturer for A$70 million. In 2014, Geely sold 90% of its stake in DSI to multiple other Chinese companies after the company suffered losses.


### Purchase of Volvo Cars (2008–2010)

Following continuing losses in that year, Ford Motor Company offered Volvo Cars for sale in December 2008. On 28 October 2009, Ford confirmed that, after considering several offers, the preferred buyer of Volvo Cars was ZGH. On 23 December 2009, Ford confirmed the terms of the sale to ZGH had been settled. A definitive agreement was signed on 28 March 2010 for US$1.8 billion. The European Commission and China's Ministry of Commerce approved the deal on 6 and 29 July 2010, respectively. The deal closed on 2 August 2010 with Geely paying $1.3 billion cash and a $200 million note. At the time of the purchase, is the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese automaker.

This acquisition facilitated Volvo's recovery and brought significant technological and managerial advancements to Geely. Under Geely ownership, Volvo Cars has developed a new line of 3- and 4-cylinder diesel and petrol engines to replace larger engines. It has also developed a new vehicle platform called the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA). Sales reached 500,000 vehicles in 2015 for the first time in the brand's history, and continued to over 700,000 in 2023. Both company jointly developed engines and platforms, notably the Compact Modular Architecture platform that is used by Volvo, Geely and Lynk & Co vehicles. Improving technical expertise and a sophisticated production management system led to a significant sales surge for Geely from 2010 onwards.


### Further acquisitions and brand establishments (2016–present)

In October 2016, Geely Auto released its new brand called Lynk & Co in Berlin, Germany, which is intended to bridge the gap between Geely and Volvo brands. The brand was launched with three production models, all based on the Compact Modular Architecture (CMA). In August 2017, ZGH, Geely Automobile Holdings and Volvo Car Group signed an agreement at Geely Auto's Hangzhou Bay R&D Center to establish the Lynk & Co joint venture. Geely Auto controls 50% of Lynk & Co, Volvo Cars held 30%, and ZGH held the remaining 20%.

In May 2017, ZGH purchased a 51% controlling-stake in Lotus Cars from its owner, DRB-HICOM, the largest shareholder of Malaysian carmaker Proton Holdings. The remaining 49% were acquired by Etika Automotive, a holding company of Proton's major shareholder Syed Mokhtar Albukhary. Proton had owned Lotus since 1996, and largely struggled to turn the fortunes of the sports car maker around. ZGH also purchased a 49.9% stake in Proton Holdings, which was agreed on 23 June 2017 and finalised on 29 September 2017. The purchase was seen to facilitate future export growth in right-hand drive markets, and making inroads into the lucrative ASEAN region. Proton confirmed that it would not downsize its workforce following its deal with Geely.

In July 2017, the company purchased Terrafugia, an American maker of flying cars. In November 2017, ZGH announced completion of the Terrafugia acquisition, including approval from all relevant regulators.

In October 2017, Volvo Cars and ZGH announced that Polestar, a performance and tuning brand owned by Volvo Cars, would become a standalone brand focusing on electric cars. Polestar introduced its first product, the Polestar 1 coupé on 17 October 2017. The car was produced at the Polestar Production Centre in Chengdu, China. Following an initial public offering, Polestar shares began trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the symbol PSNY on 24 June 2022.

In December 2017, ZGH invested €3.25 billion into Swedish truck and construction company Volvo Group, a former parent company of Volvo Cars. The deal made ZGH the biggest shareholder by number of shares with an 8.2% stake, and second by voting rights, with 15.6%.

In September 2019, ZGH led a round of private funding for Volocopter that raised $55 million for the company. Volocopter's other private investors also include Daimler AG which owns a stake in the company.

In late July 2020, it was announced that the Xingma Group had agreed to transfer a 15.2% stake of its shares in the Ma'anshan-based heavy truck manufacturer Hualing Xingma to Geely New Energy Commercial Vehicle Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of ZGH. After the transaction, Geely New Energy Commercial Vehicle Group would become the *de facto* controlling shareholder of Hualing Xingma.

In February 2020, Volvo Cars and Geely started formal discussions about a proposed merger of both businesses. In the existing arrangement, Volvo Cars has been allowed autonomy with its resources despite being fully owned by ZGH. These merger talks were later halted, and 18% of Volvo Cars shares were listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange in October 2021.

In March 2021, ZGH launched the Zeekr brand for premium electric vehicles. Its first model, the Zeekr 001 was launched in April 2021, and deliveries began in October 2021. In May 2024, Zeekr filed its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange. Zeekr raised around US$441 million, making it the largest IPO of a Chinese company since 2021.

In February 2024, Volvo Cars announced its plan to reduce its stake in Polestar by the third quarter of 2024 from currently 48.3% to around 18% by ceding it to ZGH.


#### Taizhou Declaration and restructuring

In September 2024, Li Shufu, the founder of the Geely, announced the "Taizhou Declaration", a new stage of strategic transformation of Geely that would promote the integration of internal resources, clarify the positioning of each brand, straighten out equity relationships, reduce conflicts of interest and duplication of investment, and improve resource utilization efficiency.

In October 2024, as the first step of the strategy, Geely announced to merge all Geely Geometry dealerships into Geely Galaxy dealership network.

In November 2024, Geely Holding Group (Geely) transferred its 11.3% stake in Zeekr Intelligent Technology (Zeekr) to Geely Automobile Holdings (Geely Auto). Geely Auto's shareholding ratio in Zeekr increased to 62.8%. Meanwhile, Zeekr purchased a 20% stake of Lynk & Co from Geely Auto for 3.6 billion yuan and acquire Volvo Cars 30% stake in Lynk & Co for 5.4 billion yuan. This move made Zeekr hold 51% of Lynk & Co in total, while the remaining 49% of Lynk & Co shares continues to be held by Geely Auto. In addition, the electric pickup brand Radar Auto has been consolidated into Geely Auto.

In January 2025, Geely announced to consolidate LEVC into Geely Auto.


#### Shareholding and partnerships with Daimler/Mercedes-Benz (2018–present)

In 2018, Li Shufu through his investment company Tenaciou3 Prospect Investment Limited purchased a 9.7% stake in Daimler AG (now Mercedes-Benz Group), owner of the Mercedes-Benz and Smart brands. As of 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Li Shufu is the second largest Mercedes-Benz AG shareholder after BAIC Group.

In January 2020, ZGH and Daimler AG announced a 50-50 joint venture to develop and operate the Smart brand as a global electric vehicle brand. The venture, later named Smart Automobile Co., Ltd. is headquartered in Ningbo, Zhejiang. It has a registered capital of CN¥5.4 billion, with each company contributing CN¥2.7 billion. The new all-electric Smart model from this joint venture was launched globally in 2022 as the Smart #1, previously showcased as the Concept #1 at the 2021 Munich Motor Show. Smart electric vehicles from the partnership are based on the Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) electric vehicle platform developed by Geely.


#### Renault partnerships (2021–present)

In August 2021, ZGH through its subsidiary Geely Auto formed a strategic partnership with Renault. In January 2022, the two companies signed an agreement by which Renault's South Korean subsidiary, Renault Korea Motors, would produce vehicles based on Geely Compact Modular Architecture platform, initially intended for the domestic market. As of January 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, production was slated to start by 2024. In May 2022, Renault said a Geely subsidiary was set to acquire a 34% stake of Renault Korea Motors through capital increase as part of their partnership, although the company would continue to be majority owned by Renault and a consolidated subsidiary of it. In November 2022, Renault said it plans to combine its powertrain production and development operations (including internal combustion engines and hybrid systems) with Geely's into a joint venture holding company with both as co-owners. The joint venture was officially established in late May 2024 as Horse Powertrain Limited, headquartered in London, United Kingdom.


#### Baidu partnership (2021–present)

In January 2021, ZGH announced a deal to create an electric vehicle joint venture together with Baidu, a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services, products, and artificial intelligence (AI). Baidu would develop the electric car's software while Geely would manufacture the car. The companies formed Jidu Auto in the same year, combining elements of both company names. Later, in August 2023, they launched the Ji Yue brand, with Geely owning 65% and Baidu 35%. Ji Yue is a subsidiary of Geely Group that was formed to circumvent restrictions on car manufacturing qualifications. Jidu Auto now focuses on technology solutions, including product design and AI development, for Ji Yue vehicles.

In December 2024, Geely and Baidu approached that they would help the management of their troubled electric vehicle venture Ji Yue Auto for the purpose of solving disputes with their employees which included social welfare and severance payments.
