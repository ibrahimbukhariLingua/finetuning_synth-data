## History

Ogden businessman Frank M. Browning founded Bank of Utah on Dec. 1, 1952, with 16 employees and less than $1 million in assets. Today, the bank remains locally owned and operated, and the Browning family remains involved in the bank with Frank W. Browning as chairman of the board, Benjamin F. Browning as vice chairman of the board and CEO, and Jonathan W. Browning as secretary to the board.

Historically, Bank of Utah became the first bank in the state to issue a credit card, called the "Cred-O-Matic Shopping Plan." It was also the first Utah bank to become a "motor bank" by adding a drive-up teller window to its building.

Since its creation, Bank of Utah has acquired the following banks: Bank of Ben Lomond (1974), Bank of Brigham City (1978), Bank of Northern Utah (1978), First Commerce Bank (1999) and American Bank of Commerce (AmBank) (2018).
