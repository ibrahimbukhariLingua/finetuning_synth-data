## Career


### MemoryDealers.com

Ver was the CEO of MemoryDealers.com from 1999 until 2012. In 2000, he attempted to enter politics by running for California State Assembly as a candidate for the Libertarian Party.


### Cryptocurrency

Ver began investing in bitcoin in early 2011. The first investment he made was for Charlie Shrem’s Bitinstant. Ver's investment allowed the company to hire a designer and another programmer. He invested over a million dollars into new Bitcoin-related startups, including Ripple, Blockchain.com, BitPay, and Kraken. In 2011, Ver's company Memorydealers was the first to accept Bitcoin as payment. He has been a prominent supporter of Bitcoin adoption and saw Bitcoin as a means to promote economic freedom.

In 2012, Ver was organizing Bitcoin meetups in Sunnyvale, California. He is one of five founders of the Bitcoin Foundation. Ver wants Bitcoin to rival major fiat currencies.

He is one of the main proponents of a larger block size for the Bitcoin blockchain. He supported the development of Bitcoin XT as a hard fork method towards an increase. Ver and his high school friend Jesse Powell attempted to re-establish the Mt Gox exchange during the June 2011 Bitcoin price crash.

Ver was CEO of Bitcoin.com until 1 August 2019, when he transitioned to executive chairman. In early 2020, *Fortune Magazine* mistakenly referred to Ver as the co-creator of Bitcoin Cash.


#### CoinFlex

As of June 2022, he was a shareholder in CoinFLEX, a centralized yield crypto exchange and he is rumoured to be in a large amount of debt, which caused problems for the site. On 23 June 2022, CoinFlex paused withdrawals after a counterparty, which it later named as Ver, experienced liquidity issues and failed to repay a $47 million stablecoin margin call.


#### Book Publication

In 2024, Ver published his book *Hijacking Bitcoin*, which promised to unveil the hidden history of Bitcoin.


## Personal life

Ver renounced his United States citizenship in 2014 after he became a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis. In 2015, he was denied a visa to reenter the United States by the U.S. embassy in Barbados, which claimed that he had not sufficiently proven ties outside of the United States that would motivate him to leave at the end of his visit, causing fears he might become an illegal immigrant. Later in the same year his visa was approved by the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, and he visited the United States in 2017 to speak at a conference in Aspen, Colorado. Ver's name was published in the 2018 Q1 Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate. In 2019, Ver was denied a visa to travel to Australia. In 2020, Ver also became a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda.

Ver identifies as a libertarian, anarcho-capitalist, voluntaryist, a peace advocate, and an advocate for individualism.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu is one of his major passions in life. Ver can be seen in videos competing in BJJ world championships and has achieved the rank of brown belt.


### Legal issues

In 2002, Ver pleaded guilty to selling fireworks ("explosive materials") without a license, as well as illegally storing and mailing them. Ver sold at least 14 pounds of a brand called "Pest Control Report 2000" fireworks as large firecrackers on eBay. He was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison. The manufacturer was later forced to stop making and selling the product, which contained powder exceeding the legal limit for consumer firecrackers.

He was arrested in Spain on U.S. tax evasion charges in April 2024. In December 2024 Ver's attorneys filed to have the case dismissed and Ver was still in Spain (where he had been arrested by Spanish authorities) fighting extradition to the US.


### Calls for presidential pardon

Ver's tax evasion allegations became a *cause célèbre* in American libertarian and cryptocurrency circles. A pardon, or preemptive pardon for Roger Ver, began to be called for among many libertarian and other interested groups during the first month of President Donald Trump's second term. Many libertarian figures including the then chair of the Libertarian Party in the United States, Angela McArdle (who played a key role in securing Ross Ulbricht's full pardon) suggested that a pardon for Ver might be "on the horizon". Elon Musk has reportedly also taken up the cause of seeking a full pardon for Ver and has commented on his X platform "... whether this is possible [for the president to grant]."
