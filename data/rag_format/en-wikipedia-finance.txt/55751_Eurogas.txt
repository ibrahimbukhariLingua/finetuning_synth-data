Eurogas


# Eurogas



**Eurogas** is an association representing the European gas wholesale, retail and distribution sectors towards the EU institutions. The association aims to strengthen the role of gas in the energy mix by establishing an ongoing dialogue with European industry players, global gas producers and relevant institutions. Eurogas was founded in 1990, with its members currently including 44 companies and associations from 22 countries.

The association supports a robust European gas market that encourages competitiveness, supports security of supply, delivers benefits to customers, stimulates energy efficiency and plays a significant role in reducing CO₂ emissions. Its members work together, analysing the impact of EU political and legislative initiatives on their business, to communicate their findings to the EU stakeholders and to suggest improvements. The association also provides statistics and forecasts on gas consumption in Europe.
