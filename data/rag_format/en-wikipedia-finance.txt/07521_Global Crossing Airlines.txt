Global Crossing Airlines


# Global Crossing Airlines



**Global Crossing Airlines, Inc.** (operating as **GlobalX Airlines**) is an American Part 121 domestic, flag, and supplemental charter airline headquartered in Miami, Florida. The airline was founded in 2018 by Ed Wegel, who previously co-founded the reincarnated Eastern Air Lines. In addition to providing ad-hoc and scheduled passenger charter and cargo airlift to destinations throughout the United States, Europe, the Caribbean, and Latin America, GlobalX operates the majority of deporation flights on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.


## History

In 2020, GlobalX completed a merger & spin-out with Canada Jetlines, an ultra low-cost airline headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario. In late 2020, GlobalX formed **CubaX**, a tour operator that provides weekly non-stop flights from Miami to Havana, Cuba. In 2021, CubaX began operating daily charter flights using GlobalX aircraft on behalf of Havana Air.

In January 2025, a flight operated by GlobalX transporting shackled deported migrants from the United States to Brazil experienced repeated technical problems, including struggles to take off, broken air conditioning, and an unscheduled landing due to technical issues. The conditions on the flight led to diplomatic tensions between the United States and Brazil, with Brazilian government ministers describing the handling of the deportees on the flight as "unacceptable" and "degrading".
