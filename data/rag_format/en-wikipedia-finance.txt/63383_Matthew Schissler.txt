## Professional roles


### Cord Blood America (CBAI) and Subsidiaries

In 2003, Schissler founded Cord Blood America, Inc. (CBAI), a company specializing in harvesting and storing stem cells in the U.S. and abroad, serving as the company's chairman of the board and CEO until 2012. Parents who subscribe to CBAI supply the company with a small amount of blood taken from the umbilical cord at the birth of a child, which the company stores in the event that the family may need it as the result of a medical condition that could benefit from a stem cell treatment. At the time, he also served as CEO and Chairman of the board for Cord Partners Inc., CBAI's original stem storage company, which was absorbed by CBAI in 2005.

In 2006, CBAI purchased the assets of the Cryobank for Oncologic and Reproductive Donors (CORD), a bank in Middletown, New York, with an inventory of 750 donors. In 2007, the company acquired Philadelphia-based CorCell Inc., at the time the fourth-largest umbilical cord blood bank in America. The same year, the company acquired CureSource, a Charleston-based cord blood storage facility that serviced about 340 customers. CorCell maintained its presence and name as CorCell Inc., a subsidiary of the parent company CBAI, being responsible for cord blood storage facilities. Schissler served as CorCell Inc.'s chairman, CEO and president. In 2010, they acquired 51 percent of stellacure GmbH of Hamburg, at the time the third-largest cord blood banking service in Germany, as well as a majority ownership of BioCells Argentina.

In 2010, Schissler relocated the company to Las Vegas, citing multiple reasons, including his frequent travels to Las Vegas for trade conventions, business-friendly tax climates and the ability to have low-cost laboratory space near the airport. Schissler also served as the founder and president of China Stem Cells, Inc., a stem cell storage facility in northeast China. In 2011, CBAI acquired two cord blood companies based in Chicago - Reproductive Genetics Institute, Inc, and NeoCells.
