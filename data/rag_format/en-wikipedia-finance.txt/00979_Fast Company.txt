Fast Company


# Fast Company



***Fast Company*** is an American business magazine published monthly in print and online, focusing on technology, business, and design. It releases six print issues annually.


## History

*Fast Company* was founded in November 1995 by Alan Webber and Bill Taylor, both former *Harvard Business Review* editors, and publisher Mortimer Zuckerman. Early competitors included *Red Herring*, *Business 2.0* and *The Industry Standard*.

In 1997, *Fast Company* created an online social network called the "Company of Friends," which led to the formation of numerous meeting groups. At its peak, the Company of Friends comprised over 40,000 members across 120 cities, though membership declined to 8,000 by 2003.

In 2000, Zuckerman sold *Fast Company* to Gruner + Jahr, majority-owned by media giant Bertelsmann, for $550 million. The sale coincided with the dot-com bubble burst, resulting in substantial losses and a drop in circulation. Webber and Taylor departed in 2002, and John A. Byrne, formerly a senior writer and management editor at *BusinessWeek*, became the new editor. Under Byrne, the magazine received its first Gerald Loeb Award, a prestigious honor in business journalism. However, the magazine couldn't overcome its financial decline following the dot-com bust. Despite not focusing specifically on Internet commerce, advertising pages decreased to one-third of their 2000 levels.

In 2005, Gruner + Jahr put the magazine, along with *Inc.* magazine, up for sale. Byrne contacted entrepreneur Joe Mansueto and assisted him in the acquisition. A bidding war ensued between *The Economist* and Mansueto's company, Mansueto Ventures. Mansueto, promising to keep Fast Company afloat, won the contest, acquiring both magazine titles for $35 million.

Under former editor-in-chief Robert Safian, *Fast Company* was recognized by the American Society of Magazine Editors with the magazine of the year in 2014.

Stephanie Mehta was appointed editor-in-chief in February 2018, after having worked at *Vanity Fair*, *Bloomberg*, *Fortune*, and *The Wall Street Journal*. *Fast Company* is owned by Mansueto Ventures and has its headquarters in Manhattan.

In September 2022, the Fast Company website, fastcompany.com, was compromised in an attack, and racist messages were sent. The site was accessed to send push notifications that the company identified as "obscene and racist." Consequently, the site was taken offline for eight days.

In 2024, the company won The Society Of Publication Designers (SPD) silver medal for its “World Changing Ideas” and six gold medals for its projects, including “Selena Gomez and the Meteoric Rise of Rare Beauty”, “YouTube’s Game Day”, “Brands That Matter”, “The Recommender Gift Guide”, and gold in the Best Of Science/Business/Technology category, as well as for the redesign of the magazine, which launched with the Eva Longoria issue.


## Website

Launched in 1995, FastCompany.com provides coverage of leadership and innovation in business, environmental and social issues, entertainment and marketing, and, through its Co.Design site, the intersection of business and design, spanning architecture to electronics and consumer products to fashion. *Fast Company* also previously managed sites called Co.Labs, Co.Exist, and Co.Create. Co.Exist and Co.Create were rebranded as Ideas and Entertainment sections in 2017. Co.Labs was discontinued in early 2015.


## Franchises

*Fast Company* runs several franchises, including "Most Innovative Companies", "World Changing Ideas", "Innovation By Design", and "Most Creative People". For its Most Innovative Companies feature, *Fast Company* evaluates thousands of businesses to compile a list of 50 companies deemed the most innovative. The Most Creative People in Business is a list of 100 individuals across various industries.
