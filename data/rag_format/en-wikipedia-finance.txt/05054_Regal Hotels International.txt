**Regal Hotels International** (RHI) is one of the largest hotel groups in Hong Kong. Regal Hotels International Holdings Limited is a company incorporated in Bermuda and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.


## Ownership

## REIT

In October 2006, the company announced plans to sell and separately list its hotel properties in a Real Estate Investment Trust. However, as the Sunlight REIT spun off by Henderson Land Development fell by 6.5% on its market debut on 21 December, Regal chose to delay its offer.

## Controversies

On 14 February 2025, the Hong Kong Journalists Association announced that they had to postpone their annual fund raiser dinner due to a power supply issue at the Regal Hotel in Causeway Bay. The hotel refused to reschedule or re-accommodate the event and an undercover journalist subsequently discovered that there was no such issue. This led to speculation that the hotel may have been pressured into becoming complicit in the erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong.
