## History

The bureau was founded in 1932 by business leaders led by Henry Lee Shattuck.

The organization was initially founded as a fiscal watchdog focused on the mayoral administration of James Michael Curley, the powerful Boston mayor who was later elected Governor of Massachusetts, and then later spent a portion of his final mayoral term in prison.

In 1988 Dawn-Marie Driscoll, an executive at former Boston-based department store chain Filene's, became the first woman to lead the organization's board.

Since 1985, the bureau has organized the annual Henry L. Shattuck Public Service Awards to honor employees of the City of Boston. Since 1998, the bureau has also recognized business and nonprofit leaders involved in public service in the Boston area, through the Shattuck City Champions Award.
