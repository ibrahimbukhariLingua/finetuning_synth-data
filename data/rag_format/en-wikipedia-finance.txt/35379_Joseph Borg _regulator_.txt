Borg was first elected as the president of the North American Securities Administrators Association for the 2001–02 term. The NASAA is a nonprofit organization which represents regulators from across North America. He also served in this role for the 2006–07 term and now serves on their board of directors.


## Political views

Borg has been critical of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for not imposing tougher sanctions on financial criminals. He has also argued that financial regulatory power in the U.S. should not be concentrated in one agency. Rather, he proposes that regulatory agencies across the country should attempt to work together more effectively.
