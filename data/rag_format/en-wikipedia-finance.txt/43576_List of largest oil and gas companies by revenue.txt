List of largest oil and gas companies by revenue


# List of largest oil and gas companies by revenue



Total revenue of oil and gas companies is listed in billions of U.S. dollars. Total revenue is usually self-reported by the company, and often reported by neutral, unbiased, reliable publications. Reported data may be subsequently revised or restated due to a wide range of issues such as exchange rates, contract settlements, or mid-year discontinuation of products or services. Fiscal years are for January 1 to December 31, except where noted. Empty cells indicate that no data for that year has been reported yet.

This list is partially sourced from the S&P Global Commodity Insights Top 250 Global Energy Company Rankings for 2022. The S&P Global list is restricted to publicly traded companies, and only integrated oil and gas, oil and gas exploration and production, oil and gas refining and marketing, and oil and gas storage and transportation companies were included on the list below. For state-owned oil corporations, the list below is also partially sourced from data provided by Statista and the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute.

This list provides data for parent companies, not each subsidiary.
