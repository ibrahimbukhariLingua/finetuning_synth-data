Wine Australia is now governed by the superseding law, *Wine Australia Act 2013*. Wine Australia determines the boundaries of Australia's wine regions and sometimes names them. Wine Australia also regulates wine exports, ensuring the quality and integrity of each shipment of wine exported. Wine Australia has three main departments; Compliance, Market Development and Knowledge Development.

## History

Wine Australia is a type of statutory authority known as a statutory corporation, established by the Australian Government. It was originally created as the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, which was established to provide strategic support to the Australian wine sector. It was established as an Australian Government statutory corporation directed by a board appointed by the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry at the time.


### *Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980*

In 1980, the *Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980* was passed, forming the AWBC authority that has progressed to the present. With the passing of this act, the functions of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, and thus the purpose of its formation were declared. Holistically, this act lists out its explicit objectives Part 1 s3 (1):

> *(1) The objects of this Act are:*
> 
> *(a) to promote and control the export of grape products from Australia; and*
> 
> *(b) to promote and control the sale and distribution, after export, of Australian grape products; and*
> 
> *(c) to promote trade and commerce in grape products among the States, between States and Territories and within the Territories; and*
> 
> *(d) to improve the production of grape products, and encourage the consumption of grape products, in the Territories; and*
> 
> *(e) to enable Australia to fulfil its obligations under prescribed wine‑trading agreements and other international agreements;*
> 
> *and this Act shall be construed and administered accordingly.*

The *Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980* was passed in Australian federal parliament to lawfully govern the operational activities of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the Australian wine regions respectively. This process involved the act being presented to the House of Representatives as a bill. In this form, it was subject to three readings and once ministers are satisfied, the bill was then sent to the Senate by the Sarjeant-at-Arms where the same three reading process is followed. The bill was then passed by both houses and given royal assent by the Governor General. The act itself, however came into effect 28 days after consent (in compliance with the legal policy) - known as date of proclamation.

The *Wine Corporation Act 1980*, an amended version of the *Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980*, passed in December 2010, enacting a change of name to Wine Australia.

In 2013, this piece of legislation was amended and thus recompiled to include up to date modifications and to respond to the changing demands of the wine industry in Australia. As such, it now stands as the *Wine Australia Corporation Act 2013* (Cth).

The "Label Integrity Program" is one of the main operational initiatives of the Compliance department within Wine Australia. Its role is to:

> *ensure the truth, and the reputation for truthfulness, of statements made on wine labels, or made for commercial purposes in other ways, about the vintage, variety or geographical indication of wine manufactured in Australia*

This program sets out multiple controls on wine labelling in compliance and adherence to the Geographic Indications regulations explicit in Part 6B of the Wine Australia Corporation Act. In doing so, the compliance department are able to hold administrative control over truth in labelling by ensuring winemakers keep records and by imposing audits where required. These audits under the program can occur randomly, but are also scheduled annually for each region.

Compliance protocols under this program stipulate that the minimum labelling information on wine sold in Australia is:

* producers name
* producers address
* alcohol level
* number of standard drinks
* 'contains sulfites' statement
* 'Wine of Australia' or 'Product of Australia'
* prescribed allergenic substances - milk and casein, egg whites, nuts, isinglass
