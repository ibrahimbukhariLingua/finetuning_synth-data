**Teosto** (Finnish: **Säveltäjäin Tekijänoikeustoimisto Teosto** r.y.) is a non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and composers in Finland. Teosto is a member of the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Auteurs et Compositeurs (CISAC). It represents 29 000 Finnish, and nearly three million foreign composers, songwriters, arrangers and publishers. The organization's clients are 29,000 music-using companies and communities.

Teosto has 75 important people making decisions. Its CEO is Risto Salminen since 2018, and composer Antti Auvinen is the chairman.

Teosto paid its clients 52.3 million euros in 2014 and with reimbursements from other organizations, Teosto's revenue grew up to 60.1 million euros.
