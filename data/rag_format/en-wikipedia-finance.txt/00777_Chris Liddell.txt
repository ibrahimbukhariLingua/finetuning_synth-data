Liddell served as vice chairman and chief financial officer at General Motors, where he managed the company’s $23 billion IPO in November 2010, which, at that time, which was the largest public offering in history. “Chris was a major contributor during a pivotal time in the company’s history,” said Daniel Akerson, former GM chairman and CEO.

In 2014, Xero, the cloud-based accounting software developer appointed Liddell as its new chairman. Xero's chief executive and founder Rod Drury said Liddell’s contribution had seen the New Zealand-founded company’s annualized committed monthly revenue (ACMR) triple during his tenure, stating “Chris leaves us in a good position with strong global revenue growth.” Liddell resigned from the New Zealand-based company to take on a new role in United States president-elect Donald Trump's administration.

### Government

In 2012, Liddell was executive director of transition planning for the Romney Presidential Campaign and helped author The Romney Readiness Project, a comprehensive presidential transition guide. In 2013, Romney Readiness Project 2012: Retrospectives and Lessons Learned was published. In the foreword, Romney wrote, "My campaign was not successful but our Readiness Project team was."

Liddell advocates for a new approach to presidential transitions called the "Five-Year Presidency." He suggests that presidential candidates should view their term not just as a constitutional four-year term, but as a five-year journey that launches at least a year before the election. Liddell proposes that candidates should focus on key tasks during this "Year Zero" to set themselves up for success, such as assembling a leadership team and preparing for crises.

In January 2017, he was appointed as assistant to the president for strategic initiatives in Donald Trump's White House, He was appointed to the Office of American Innovation (OAI) when it was established on 27 March 2017, where he was focusing on federal IT modernization. He opted to receive the minimum salary required to get health insurance, $30,000. He was also appointed director of the American Technology Council and was a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. In March 2018 he was picked to replace Rick Dearborn as White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. In his White House roles he has coordinated administration policy around a number of technology issues, in particular relating to cyber security, and to the Industries of the Future, which include Artificial Intelligence, 5G, Advanced Manufacturing, Quantum Computing and Synthetic Biology.

He served as the White House lead for the Trillion Trees Initiative, part of the Trillion Tree Campaign, which aims to conserve, restore, and grow a trillion trees around the world by 2030. President Trump signed an Executive Order "Establishing the One Trillion Trees Interagency Council" in October 2020. Liddell oversaw the Administration's contribution, and represented the White House during its engagements with 1t.org and the 1t.org Stakeholder Council.

In October 2020 he was nominated by Donald Trump to be the next secretary-general of the OECD. On 20 January 2021, the OECD confirmed that Liddell had withdrawn his nomination to serve as the secretary-general of the OECD.

New Zealand's government did not make a decision to support the nomination. The left-wing Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand said he should be rejected as his work for Trump had eroded multilateral approaches in the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization. The right-wing New Zealand National Party said it would be in New Zealand's interest to have a "boy from Matamata" in the role, but later reversed their support for Liddell.

Prior to the 2021 inauguration Liddell called for legislation that "allows a provisional ascertainment to occur so that an incoming administration [and] the president-elect can get security briefings for a lot of the time-sensitive issues regardless of whether the formal election has been settled or not."

Liddell reportedly considered resigning after the January 6 United States Capitol attack in Washington D.C., but announced he would stay on to ensure a smooth transition to President-elect Joe Biden. Liddell had a key role in the transition.

David Marchick elaborated on Liddell’s role in the tumult of the translation in his book *The Peaceful Transfer of Power: An Oral History of America’s Presidential Transitions*, noting that while Presidential transitions are incredibly complicated endeavors in the best of circumstances, Liddell had “kept order, done heroic work in an impossible environment.”

Author, documentary filmmaker, and White House historian Chris Whipple, in a preview chapter on the transition from his book on the Biden White House, *The Fight of His Life*, published in Vanity Fair, said that Liddell “helped make the transfer of power possible, becoming an unlikely leader of a plot to save democracy.”

Liddell's book, *Year Zero: The Five-Year Presidency*, explores the crucial elements of building and operating an effective White House, emphasizing its pivotal role in the success of a presidency and the democratic process in the United States. Drawing on his experience as the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Liddell provides a strategic framework for a strong presidency. The book, published by the University of Virginia Press, offers concrete, nonpartisan steps to improve White House functionality and rebuild trust in this fundamental institution.

In the Time essay *How Rocky Presidential Transitions Put America at Risk*, Liddell explores the national security risks inherent in political transitions. Liddell draws attention to historical examples and underscores the need for proactive planning by presidential candidates. He advocates for early submission of national security team nominees and emphasizes the importance of cooperation between outgoing and incoming teams to effectively address potential crises.
