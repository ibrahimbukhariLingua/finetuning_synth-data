The community development programme which was launched in 1952 in Himachal, in certain selected areas was later extended to the entire rural Himachal. In Mandi and Kangra, package programmes were undertaken in collaboration with the West Germany to popularising modern techniques of cultivation among the farmers. Suitable agricultural machinery and animal husbandry were introduced in these areas. Well equipped soil testing laboratories, dairy farms and agricultural workshops were set up at various centres, besides an Agriculture University at Palampur.

## Economic History

In tracing the economic history of Himachal Pradesh, influential political figures have played pivotal roles in shaping the trajectory of the state's development. During the post-independence era in the 1950s to 1970s, Yashwant Singh Parmar emerged as a key figure, serving as the first Chief Minister. Parmar's leadership was marked by significant initiatives such as implementing land reforms and modernizing agriculture. In the subsequent decades, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, Virbhadra Singh, a prominent political figure, contributed significantly to the state's focus on tourism and the harnessing of hydroelectric power.

As the 21st century unfolded, the landscape of Himachal Pradesh's economy underwent further transformations. Political leadership, exemplified by figures like Prem Kumar Dhumal, emphasized the diversification of the economy into information technology and service sectors, with cities like Shimla and Dharamshala emerging as IT hubs. In more recent times, Jai Ram Thakur has been a central figure, serving as Chief Minister and contributing to the state's industrial growth. His tenure has seen efforts to establish Special Economic Zones, fostering industries such as pharmaceuticals, textiles, and food processing. It's important to recognize that economic development is a collaborative effort, and the contributions of these political figures have been crucial in steering Himachal Pradesh towards sustained growth and diversification.
