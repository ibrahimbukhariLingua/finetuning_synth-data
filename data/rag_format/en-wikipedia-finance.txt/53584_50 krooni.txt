50 krooni


# 50 krooni



The **50 krooni** banknote (**50 EEK**) is a denomination of the Estonian kroon, the former currency of Estonia. A portrait of Rudolf Tobias (1873–1918), a famous Estonian composer, is engraved on the front side of the bill along with the pipe organ of the Käina church (which features the Eye of Providence).

The vignette on the back features the Estonia Theatre in Tallinn. The only printing of the 50 krooni banknote took place in 1994. Fewer 50 krooni notes were ordered by the Bank of Estonia than any other denominations. A medium size banknote, it was one of the most rarely used denominations. It can be exchanged indefinitely at the currency museum of Eesti Pank for €3.20.
