## History

Prior to 1957, the Indian rupee was not decimalised. From 1835 to 1957, the rupee was divided into 16 annas. Each anna was further divided into four Indian paises (pice) and each paise into three Indian pies till 1947 when the pice was demonetised. In 1955, the Parliament of India amended the "Indian Coinage Act" to adopt the decimal system for coinage. Paisa coins were introduced in 1957, but from 1957 to 1964 the coin was called "Naya Paisa" (English: *New Paisa*). On 1 June 1964, the term "Naya" was dropped and the denomination was simply called "One paisa". Paisa coins were issued as a part of "The Decimal Series". In 2019, new coins were adopted, but the 50 paise coins were not updated as they have ceased to be in common circulation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
