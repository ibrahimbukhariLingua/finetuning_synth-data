The Operator manages a total of five container terminals in Russia, including Petrolesport, First Container Terminal, Ust-Luga Container Terminal and Moby Dik all situated along the Baltic Sea. Additionally, in the Far East they oversee Eastern Stevedoring Company in Vostochny Port on the Sea of Japan.

## History

Global Ports came into existence in 2008, built upon the foundation of port assets belonging to the N-Trans Group. The group included Eastern Stevedoring Company, Petrolesport, Moby Dik Container Terminal, Yanino Logistics Park and a 50% stake of Vopak EOS Oil Products Terminal.

In 2011, Global Ports initiated an IPO on the London Stock Exchange with the entire company’s valuation standing at $2.35 billion. The offering itself totaled $534 million, with $100 million of that amount going to the company and the remainder to N -Trust. The company’s free float was pegged at 25%.

In November 2012, APM Terminals B.V., a terminal division of the A.P.Møller – Mærsk group, acquired half of N-Trans’s shares in Global Ports, representing a 37.5% stake in the company. In preparation for this transaction, Global Ports secured a 25% stake in the Eastern Stevedoring Company from the Arab port operator DP Worl.

In 2013, Global Ports bought the “National Container Company”. This encompassed 100% ownership of the First Container Terminal, 80% of the Ust-Luga Container Terminal and 100% of the Logistics-Terminal company (a dry port located in the south of St. Petersburg). In exchange for this acquisition, NCC transferred $291 million and 18% of its own shares to Global Ports. Consequently, the stakes held by major shareholders N-Trans and APM Terminals dipped from 37.5% to 30.75%, while the share of shares available for public trading dropped from 25% to 20.5%.

In 2017, made a strategic decision to sell 100% of Logistics-Terminal CJSC to TransContainer.

In 2018, Delo Group purchased a 30.75% stake in Global Ports from N-Tran.

In 2019, Global Ports sold the Vopak E.O.S. terminal in Estonia.

In 2022, Delo Group increased its stake in Global Ports to 61.5% by purchasing shares owned by APM Terminals.

In 2023, Global Ports Group initiated the process of delisting and concluding the GDR program on the London Stock Exchange. Additionally, the Company made a strategic decision to redomicile from the Republic of Cyprus to the Russian Federation, establishing a presence in a special administrative region (SAR) on the territory of Russky Island in the Primorsky Krai.
