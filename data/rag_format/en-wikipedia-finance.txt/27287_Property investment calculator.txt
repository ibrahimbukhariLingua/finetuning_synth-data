Property investment calculator


# Property investment calculator



**Property investment calculator** is a term used to define an application that provides fundamental financial analysis underpinning the purchase, ownership, management, rental and/or sale of real estate for profit. Property investment calculators are typically driven by mathematical finance models and converted into source code. Key concepts that drive property investment calculators include returns, cash flow, affordability of financing, investment strategy, equity and risk management.


## Calculations

Here are some of the calculations that one may expect to see from a property investment calculator along with definitions.

1. Cash on cash return – Cash flow in year 1 divided by cash invested in the property.
2. Equity build up rate – Increase in equity in year 1 from mortgage principal payments divided by cash invested in the property.
3. Capitalization rate – Net operating income (NOI) divided by property's asset value.
4. Gross rent multiplier – The ratio between a rental property's gross scheduled income and its market value.
5. Net cash flows – The amount of cash to expect to receive after expenses.
6. Net present value of future cash flows – The sum of net future cash flows discounted back to the present value using the time value of money to understand what future cash flows are worth today.
7. Gross rental income – The total rental income one expects to receive.
8. Operating expenses – All expenses associated with operating the property. These can include homeowner's insurance, property taxes, and maintenance expenses to name a few.
9. Net operating income (NOI) – Net operating income is also known as net income and is income received after subtracting all operating expenses. This will exclude income taxes and interest.
10. Depreciation – The expense associated with the depreciation of your property. For more information on depreciation, see IRS Publication 946.

## History

In response to 2007 subprime mortgage crisis and preceding US property bubble, a number of residential property investment analysis tools and applications have been launched to the public by both government, commercial organisations and as part of open source projects. These analytical tools have been developed to help real estate investors to understand the risk and returns of residential property investing. These tools have included mortgage calculator, residential property depreciation calculators and property investment calculators. A number of web technology companies have also developed comprehensive all-in-one packages that provide financing, risk and return analysis, investment strategy and portfolio management capabilities.
