## Early life

## Public service

Eisenberg was appointed by New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman to chair the New Jersey Commission on Privatization and Competitive Contracting in 1994. He was elected chairman of the board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey on November 9, 1995. Prior to his election as chairman, Eisenberg had served since February 1994 as a commissioner on the same agency's board, having been nominated by Governor Christine Todd Whitman. During his term as chairman, his most notable achievement was the negotiation of a long-term lease with Larry Silverstein for the World Trade Center; the Towers were at their highest occupancy in history in the late 1990s and the desire to privatize the buildings was born from an economic strategy of the Pataki administration.

His term as chairman of the Port Authority ended in December 2001. It was during his time as chairman that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks occurred at the Twin Towers, taking the lives of 84 Port Authority employees including then executive director Neil Levin.

Prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Eisenberg was scheduled to step down as chairman of the Port Authority in preparation for a proposed appointment by then Acting New Jersey Governor Donald DiFrancesco to the chairmanship of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.

Eisenberg chose to stay on at the Port Authority through the days after the 9/11 attack and to provide "continued leadership" in order "to provide a comforting continuity in times of tragedy". Soon after stepping down from the Port Authority, New York Governor George Pataki appointed Eisenberg as a director of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's board in January 2002, where he remained involved with the aftermath of the attacks and contributed to the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. At that time he was appointed by Pataki to chair the Victims' Families and Transportation Advisory Council until April 2003.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
