INCAE Business School


# INCAE Business School



**INCAE Business School** (an acronym for ***In**stituto **C**entroamericano de **A**dministración de **E**mpresas*, English: Central American Institute of Business Administration") is an international business school located at the Walter Kissling Gam campus in Costa Rica. The school was founded with the assistance of professors from Harvard Business School in 1964. Although INCAE is independent, it adheres to the Harvard's case study method.

The case study method allows students to examine past and current business situations, which gives them two years' worth of indirect, real-world experience across industries and regions. The case study method offers students the opportunity to step into the shoes of managers, critique their decisions and provide alternative solutions. While the majority of cases are translations from Harvard Business School case studies, INCAE students are additionally provided with emerging market studies from Latin America.

INCAE offers a 2-year MBA in Costa Rica. Other programs include the Executive MBA and seminars.

The *Financial Times* has ranked INCAE as a top global MBA program and *The Wall Street Journal* has ranked INCAE Business School as one of the top 10 international business schools in the world.


## History

On March 23, 1963, President John F. Kennedy visited Costa Rica and met with the presidents of Costa Rica El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In the meeting, the presidents requested Kennedy's assistance in establishing a business administration program that would produce future managers. On April 10, President Kennedy wrote to George P. Baker, Dean of the Harvard Business School, thanking the school for taking interest in the initiative. Dean Baker sent three professors, George Cabot Lodge, Henry Arthur and Thomas Raymond, to gauge the level of support from the business community and society at large in each of the Central American countries for the project.

Francisco de Sola, a Salvadoran business leader, took the leadership role in consolidating support for the project. On December 13, 1963, a provisional administrative committee was appointed to head the project that would be known as the INCAE Project. Francisco de Sola was named Chairman of the Administrative Committee, a position he would hold for the next twenty years. The founding Rector of the school was Ernesto Cruz.

INCAE's first academic program was the Advanced Management Program, PAG for its name in Spanish. Between the first of July and the seventh of August, 1964, 45 executives from countries in the region gathered in Antigua, Guatemala, for the program. The first PAG was taught by Harvard Business School professors. In subsequent years some PAG students attended Harvard University's International Teacher Program (ITP). Some of them later went on to complete doctoral programs at Harvard Business School and returned to become part of INCAE's faculty. In 1969, INCAE's first MBA was awarded.

Nicaragua was chosen as the permanent site for INCAE, and on June 20, 1969, INCAE's first campus was inaugurated in the Montefresco neighborhood of Managua. The 70-hectare (170-acre) site was purchased with funds raised through donations from the private sector and the governments of Central America, the result of a campaign headed by INCAE's National Committee in Nicaragua. Montefresco was chosen from the other options in Nicaragua because of its scenery and cool climate. It was also close to Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. The campus was built with a loan provided by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration with United States Agency for International Development funding. INCAE's first fifteen MBA classes graduated in Nicaragua.

In 1983, INCAE decided to move its MBA program. The second campus, called the Walter Kissling Gam campus, opened in Alajuela, Costa Rica in 1984. Costa Rica was chosen because of its stable government and existing infrastructure. In 1996, INCAE reopened the full-time MBA program in the Montefresco campus, and in 2000 the Montefresco campus also began to offer the executive MBA program.


## Faculty

This contact occurs through consulting work for firms. Professors are encouraged to conduct research and publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals.
