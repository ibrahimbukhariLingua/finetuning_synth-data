Fair Economy Illinois


# Fair Economy Illinois



**Fair Economy Illinois** is a coalition of four social justice groups, in the United States, that advocates against state budget cuts and for higher income taxes on wealthy individuals and businesses in Illinois by organizing urban, suburban and rural residents. It began in May 2011 as Make Wall Street Pay until it changed to its current name in March 2013. The group has also worked to pass a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing and protested against financial support for the Illinois coal industry. Fair Economy Illinois organizes Moral Mondays Illinois protests.
