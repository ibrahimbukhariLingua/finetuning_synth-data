Brenthurst Foundation


# Brenthurst Foundation



The **Brenthurst Foundation** is a Johannesburg-based think-tank established by the Oppenheimer family in 2004 to support the Brenthurst Initiative in seeking ways to fund African development and to organize conferences on African competitiveness.


## Description

The Foundation was created to build on the Oppenheimers' Brenthurst Initiative of August 2003. The Initiative was designed to instigate a debate in South Africa around policy strategies to achieve higher rates of economic expansion.

Today the Foundation now has a wider African focus and aims to find ways to draw the investment needed for "continental regeneration and prosperity". The organisation intends to make a worthwhile contribution to economic growth in Africa by creating an environment conducive to positive economic change in order to strengthen the importance of Africa in the global market. It works to set up government policy platforms for economic development through organising high-level governmental dialogues, supporting economic and political research on topical and important issues, and disseminating practical policy advice to relevant actors. The organisation has been described as a frontier of knowledge for strengthening Africa’s economic performance.

The Foundation has been active in a range of roles in various countries across the continent, including in Ghana, Zambia, Kenya, Zanzibar, Malawi, Lesotho, Somaliland, Sudan, Rwanda, Mozambique, Mali, Eswatini, Morocco, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Ethiopia.

The Foundation also organises regular policy study-tours for its African partners to a number of countries. These aim to expose African opinion-formers to development 'best practice'. These trips have included participation by officials up to the prime-ministerial level, and incorporated meetings with current and former heads of state. Countries visited in the past include: Vietnam (2007, 2009, 2011), Singapore (2008 and 2009), Cambodia (2011), Panama (2009), Colombia (2009 and 2014), Costa Rica (2009), El Salvador (2009) and Morocco (2008 and 2019) and Poland (2023).

The Foundation publishes op-ed articles and discussion papers on matters related to growth and security and hosts election monitoring missions in Africa. It also conducts opinion surveys on key policy matters and on election attitudes.

Hosted by Jonathan Oppenheimer at the Tswalu Kalahari Game Reserve in South Africa’s Kalahari Desert, the Tswalu Dialogue has involved active collaboration between a variety of international partners.

## The Gdansk Declaration

From 21-23 June 2023, the European Solidarity Centre and The Brenthurst Foundation staged a conference on 'Rolling Back Authoritarianism' in Gdańsk, Poland, the epicentre of political change in Poland and in Europe in the late 1980s. The event was attended by more than 50 leaders from Africa, Latin America, Poland and the Baltic States. At the end of the event, the Gdańsk Declaration was adopted unanimously. It lays out the commitment of all delegates to ending authoritarianism and introducing democracy, accountability and transparency.

The event was held at the historic Gdańsk shipyard where the tide turned against authoritarianism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nobel laureate Lech Walesa, who led the shipyard uprising and later became President of Poland, addressed the meeting and signed the declaration along with 57 other leaders. Ukrainian Nobel laureate, Oleksandra Matviichuk, Head of Centre for Civil Liberties, also signed the declaration.
