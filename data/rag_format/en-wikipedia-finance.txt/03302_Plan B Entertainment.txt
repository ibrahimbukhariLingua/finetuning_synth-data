Plan B Entertainment


# Plan B Entertainment



**Plan B Entertainment, Inc.**, more commonly known as **Plan B**, is an American production company founded in November in 2001 by Brad Pitt, Brad Grey, Kristin Hahn and Jennifer Aniston. The company first signed with Warner Bros. as a replacement for Brad Grey Pictures, a company operated by Brad Grey. In 2005, after Pitt and Aniston divorced, Grey became the CEO of Paramount Pictures and Pitt became the sole owner of the company. The president of the company was for many years Dede Gardner, but she and Pitt named Jeremy Kleiner co-president with Gardner in 2013. Three of the production company's movies, *The Departed*, *12 Years a Slave* and *Moonlight*, have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Pitt, Gardner and Kleiner received the Producers Guild of America's David O. Selznick Achievement Award in Theatrical Motion Pictures in 2020.

This name was previously used for an unrelated production company that was headed by Bruce Berman from 1996 to 1997.

In December 2022, it was reported that Mediawan has acquired 60% of the studio, while Plan B has also taken a stake in Mediawan.
