He began his entrepreneurial journey at a young age, leveraging his experience to identify genuine creative minds capable of working with passion and producing turbulent growth. The center has so far incubated 50 companies, where the companies are trained to identify an idea, understand hi-tech markets, and develop emerging technologies. Roychand has plans to create 500 entrepreneurs in the next five years.

T. V. Mohandas Pai, Chairman of Manipal Global Education, said that Roychand, "is the Indian version of an angel investor with a lot of mentoring and support, where you treat it as a family business and the entrepreneur becomes part of the family. It is not like the Western model of high growth and high return. Here, the person who is mentoring is more important than the investment."
