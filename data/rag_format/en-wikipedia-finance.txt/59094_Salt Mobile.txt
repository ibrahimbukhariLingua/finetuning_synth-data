## History

Salt was founded in 1999 as the Swiss subsidiary of Orange, and began offering its telecommunications services in mid-1999. The merger with Sunrise was prohibited by the Swiss competition authority WEKO in April 2010. Later, in 2012, it was sold to the British investment company, Apax Partners. It continued to license and operate under the Orange name until 2015, when the company was sold by Apax Partners to NJJ Holding of Xavier Niel and the Salt brand was launched.
