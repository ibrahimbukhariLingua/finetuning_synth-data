## History

Charles Cascarilla and Rich Teo founded Paxos in 2012 as the **itBit** Bitcoin exchange. In 2015, the company changed its legal name from itBit to Paxos Trust Company. At the same time, the New York State Department of Financial Services granted Paxos a limited-purpose trust charter, making it the first company in the U.S. approved and regulated to offer crypto products and services.

The company received $65 million in a funding round in May 2018. In September 2018, Paxos launched the Paxos Standard stablecoin as one of the industry’s first regulated stablecoins. Paxos introduced PAX Gold, the first regulated gold-backed digital token, in September 2019.

In October 2019, Paxos received a no-action letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to test a new settlement service for U.S.-listed equities on a private blockchain. The service went live in February 2020. In July 2020, Paxos launched its crypto brokerage with Revolut as the first client.

In October 2020, PayPal announced that it would offer cryptocurrency buy, hold and sell services to its users through a partnership with Paxos.

In September 2022, Canada-based multi-asset retail financial trading services provider OANDA Global Corporation (OANDA) collaborated with Paxos to develop a crypto trading ecosystem. On 20 October 2022, OANDA launched crypto trading function to its forex trading platform in partnership with Paxos. The partnership will allow the U.S.-based clients of OANDA to trade cryptocurrencies on Paxos’ itBit exchange from the OANDA mobile app.
