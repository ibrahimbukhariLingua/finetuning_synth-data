## History

Telekom Srpske was established on 20 December 1996. It was privatized in 2006, through a public tender. Telekom Srbija, made the highest bid with 646 million euros for a 65% majority stake, while the second highest bidder was Telekom Austria with an offer of 467 million euros.

The Government of Republika Srpska declared Telekom Srpske a company of strategic importance and, therefore, the state capital has been privatised according to the special privatisation program enacted by the Government. Raiffeisen Investment was appointed as the financial advisor to the government. The criteria that potential bidders had to fulfil, included a current minimum of 800,000 fixed-line and 1.5m mobile users, suggesting that the Government is hoping for an outside operator who is capable of investing in Telekom Srpske's infrastructure.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
