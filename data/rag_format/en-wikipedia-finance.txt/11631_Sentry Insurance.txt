## History

Sentry Insurance was founded in 1904 by members of the Wisconsin Retail Hardware Association, now the Midwest Hardware Association, to provide insurance for its members in the hardware industry. Its headquarters for many years was the Hardware Mutual Insurance Companies Building, built in 1922 and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Though supplanted by a new headquarters in 1977, the historic building remained in use by the company until 2019, when operations out of the historic building were moved to a newly constructed facility just across from the main headquarters. The new building stands 7 stories in height and filled a long vacant field on the city’s north side.

The company also owns its own golf course, SentryWorld, which opened in 1982. Designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr., it is regarded as a "destination golf course".

## Logo

Sentry rebranded in 2016. A new Sentry word mark includes a symbol made up of two stylized single quote quotation marks paired up into a circle, reminiscent of the yin and yang symbol, representing two sides of a conversation. The negative space between the quotation marks takes on the shape of an S.

The company's previous logo was a Minuteman image based on a sculpture of Capt. John Parker located in Lexington, Massachusetts.
