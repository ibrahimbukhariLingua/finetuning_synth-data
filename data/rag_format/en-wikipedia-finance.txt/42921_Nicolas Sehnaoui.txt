By June 2013, with the infrastructure well on its way to recovery, Sehnaoui turned his attention to Lebanon's knowledge economy, more specifically its digital economy: he created Beirut Angels – Lebanon's 1st tech startup angel network – and actively supported the creation of Banque du Liban Circular 331 – a groundbreaking US$400 million equity investment guarantee initiative that transformed Lebanon's banks into VC-oriented institutions.

Between 91 and 95 the movement published a monthly magazine, ‘Al Mouaten’ (directly translated as ‘the citizen’), in both Arabic and French and produced a short movie titled ‘If the People One Day’ which calls for the organization of a war tribunal to judge war crimes committed during the Lebanese Civil War.
