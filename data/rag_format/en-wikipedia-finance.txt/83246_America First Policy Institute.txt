America First Policy Institute


# America First Policy Institute



The **America First Policy Institute** (**AFPI**) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit think tank that was founded in 2021 to promote Donald Trump's public policy agenda. The organization was founded by Brooke Rollins, who serves as president and CEO and was formerly the acting director of the United States Domestic Policy Council under Trump, and Larry Kudlow, who serves as vice chair and formerly served as the Director of the National Economic Council under Trump. The chairperson of the organization is Linda McMahon, who formerly served as Administrator of the Small Business Administration under Trump and then as chairwoman of America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC.


## Activities

According to *Politico*, the group is often described as a "White House in waiting". The group produced a document about its vision, which includes "job creation and low unemployment, expansion of affordable housing, eradicating COVID-19, reducing federal bureaucracy, cracking down on crime and illegal immigration, passing congressional term limits, and ending foreign war and reliance on China." As of 2023, AFPI had 172 employees, including eight former cabinet secretaries from the Trump administration.


## Role in second Trump administration

According to DeSmog, in mid-December 2024, "Trump's cabinet picks so far have more direct links to AFPI than any other organization."

AFPI sponsored a transition project which was viewed as a rival to Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.


## Positions

According to *New York Times* reporter Ken Bensinger, key policy proposals from the AFPI's policy book, *The America First Agenda*, include eliminating most civil service protections for federal employees, allowing summary dismissals without appeal; expanding domestic oil and gas production by opening up new federal lands for fast-tracked petroleum exploration and drilling, and resumed construction of the Keystone pipeline; imposing supervised ultrasound requirements and mandatory waiting periods before abortions, as well as ending federal funding for organizations like Planned Parenthood; opposing red flag laws that restrict gun ownership for high-risk individuals; and supporting nationwide reciprocity for concealed carry permits, enabling a permit from any state to authorize concealed carry across all 50 states. Other policy proposals include imposing tariffs on imports, reducing corporate taxes, protecting religious freedom, rolling back climate change initiatives and getting out of the Paris climate agreement, opposing transgender rights, adding work requirements for Medicaid and limiting U.S. involvement in global conflicts. It proposes the restriction of immigration by completing the U.S.-Mexico border wall, boosting funding for border agents, and ending legal immigration programs like family-based visas and the visa lottery.


## Funding

The institute does not disclose its donors and has taken meetings with lobbyists hoping to influence its policy agenda. Trump has fundraised for the group and his Save America PAC has donated $1 million to the institute.
