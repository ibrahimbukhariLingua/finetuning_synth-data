Electric vehicle industry in China


# Electric vehicle industry in China



The **electric vehicle industry in China** is the largest in the world, accounting for around 58% of global production of electric vehicles (EVs) in 2023 and more than 1.28 million exports in 2024. In 2024, CAAM reported China had sold 12.87 million passenger electric vehicles, with 60% of those sales being BEVs (battery-only EVs) and 40% being PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). China also dominates the plug-in electric bus and light commercial vehicle market, reaching over 500,000 buses (98% of global stock) and 247,500 electric commercial vehicles (65% of global stock) in 2019,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and recording new sales of 447,000 commercial EVs in 2023.

Plug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales were 47.9% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2024. This is a significant increase from 2020, when plug-in electric vehicles accounted for only 6.3% of total sales. The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots.

The battery industry is closely related to the EV industry as batteries constitute around 1/3 of the cost of EVs and around 80% of lithium-ion batteries in the world are used in EVs. The industry also has significant Chinese presence, with major players including world's largest CATL, BYD, CALB, Gotion, SVOLT and EVE Energy.


## History


## Electric vehicle manufacturers

Plug-in electric vehicle (BEV and PHEV) sales was 15% of the overall automotive sales in China in 2021. NEV adoption rapidly increased to a record 28% in March 2022, and according to BYD chairman Wang Chuanfu could reach 35% by end of 2022, exceeding the government goal of 20% by 2025. The plug-in market in China was dominated by Chinese companies, with BYD Auto and SAIC Motor occupying the top two spots, and 5 out of the top 7 spots.

It is difficult to estimate the comparative size of EV companies in China as foreign companies such as Tesla and VW have significant sales and manufacturing in China, while Chinese companies such as BYD have significant overseas sales. Some Chinese companies also have foreign-based subsidiaries such as Geely, which owns Polestar and Lynk & Co.

According to *Bloomberg*, there were 500 Chinese electric car manufacturers in China in 2019. After fierce competition, only 100 manufacturers remained by 2023. According to *Wired*, as many as 300 manufacturers, both domestic and international, were offering electric vehicles in China in 2023.

Tesla opened its first "Gigafactory" outside the United States in Shanghai, China, in 2019. Giga Shanghai was the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company, and was built in less than 6 months, becoming Tesla's main export hub. In November 2021, total production was 56,965 vehicles and capacity was estimated to be nearing 700,000 vehicles per year, becoming the largest of the Tesla factories. There is an expansion planned to increase capacity to up to 1.1 million in 2022, and possibly 2 million in the future, becoming the company's largest plant by far.

Volkswagen manufactures electric vehicles in China through joint ventures such as Volkswagen Anhui (formerly JAC-VW), SAIC-VW (Anting), FAW-VW (Foshan), producing vehicles based on the Volkswagen MEB platform.

## Other developments


### Energy storage

E-vehicles use only electric motors and gearboxes, and have few parts requiring maintenance. Compared to traditional vehicles and excluding the battery, they are cheaper and easier to build. However, building battery with sufficient capacity and discharge-cycles is a challenge.

BYD Company is a Chinese company that builds rechargeable batteries using a new technology that, according to the company, makes them safer than other lithium-ion models. In 2005, it became the world's leading small battery company and is one of the world's largest manufacturers of rechargeable batteries. It is emerging as a leader in the technology sector.

Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co. Ltd. is another China based battery manufacturer. The company has a partnership with Coda Automotive, a California based company, to develop a Coda electric vehicle and ultimately, batteries for use in electricity generation. The focus of the latter will be to provide energy storage for wind and solar energy generation.

In 2017, the government battery subsidies fell by 30% and Chinese EV sales dropped.


### Energy infrastructure

While the shape of this industry is still emerging, electricity generation and the infrastructure to deliver energy appear to be the areas with the highest potential and relevancy to manage future energy use. According to consulting group Oliver Wyman, "some utilities are already engaging a specific area of the value chain, setting priorities for near-term, medium-term, and long-term initiatives. They have begun to model different market and business impact scenarios, with the goal of identifying the biggest upsides and pitfalls."

Utilities have begun to develop focused strategies in areas where they are well positioned to serve the electric-vehicle value chain. At the moment, a variety of business design ideas are competing to shape the new marketplace. China has invested a great deal into this fundamental component of the value chain, and some of the principal facilitators are as follows:

* State Grid Corporation of China
* Jiangxi Ganneng. Co

An electricity provider, year-end 2009, the Company finished approximately six billion kilowatt-hours of on-grid electricity, and had an attributable installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts, including 1.4 million kilowatts of thermal power and 100,000 kilowatts of hydropower.

* NARI Technology

The Company develops, manufactures and sells software and hardware products serving the power industry, and also provide system integration services. It also provides software and hardware services and system integration services for things such as power grid dispatching automation products, electricity market commercial operating systems, and electrical control automation products.

* XJ Electric Co.

This company is primarily engaged in research, development, manufacture and distribution of automation, protection and controlling products for electric power systems. Specifically, it provides power grid and power generation equipment, transformers, electrical systems, power distribution network products, electrified railway products and direct current (DC) power distribution systems.


### Encouraging policy

China has promoted the development of the electric vehicle (EV) industry through a series of encouraging policy measures to reduce petroleum fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the market for electric cars is small. Against this backdrop, the Chinese government began phasing out EV subsidies in 2018 with the goal of eliminating them by 2022. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced a series of incentive policy measures to promote the development of the electric vehicle industry, such as consumer subsidies, various tax exemptions, toll-free, charging infrastructure construction, research and development grants, etc. (R & D) electric vehicle manufacturers. In February 2024, China approved a joint venture between subsidiaries of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. They would work on building a rapid charging network in the country.


### Export

In 2024 the European Union raised tariffs on EVs imported from China following an anti-subsidy probe, prompting China to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organization.
