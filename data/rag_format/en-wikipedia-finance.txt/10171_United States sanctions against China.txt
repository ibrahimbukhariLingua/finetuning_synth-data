United States sanctions against China


# United States sanctions against China



The United States government applies economic sanctions against certain institutions and key members of the government of the People's Republic of China and its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), certain companies linked to the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and other affiliates that the U.S. government has accused of aiding in human rights abuses. The U.S. maintained embargoes against China from the inception of the People's Republic of China in 1949 until 1972. An embargo was reimposed by the U.S. following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. From 2020 onward, the U.S. imposed sanctions and visa restrictions against several Chinese government officials and companies, in response to the persecution of Uyghurs in China, human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Tibet, military-civil fusion, support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and fentanyl production.

Economic sanctions and export controls against China are administered and enforced by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), respectively.


## History

Due to concerns about national security and human rights, the United States has gradually increased sanctions against Chinese businesses and organizations. According to the United States Department of Commerce, 721 Chinese businesses, organizations, and individuals have been added to an "entity list" that restricts their ability to purchase goods from the United States.


### Sanctions in the early PRC (1949–1979)

After the establishment of Communist rule in China in 1949, an embargo against the sale of military technology or infrastructure, previously levied against the Soviet Union, was expanded to include the newly established People's Republic of China. Following the onset of the Korean War, further trade restrictions were imposed. According to academic Chun Lin, the embargo resulted in increased Chinese nationalism.

The trade embargo was lifted under President Richard Nixon in 1972 right before the opening of China and establishment of official relations.


### Sanctions after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre

Following the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Bush Sr. administration imposed an arms embargo against the PRC after the massacre of the protesters.

This restricts U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei without a government license. Various U.S.-based companies immediately froze their business with Huawei to comply with the regulation. That same year, it was determined that Huawei also provided equipment to build North Korea’s 3G network.
