## History

The ISC Paris business school was inaugurated in the autumn of 1963 at 6 avenue Léon Heuzey, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Founded by Paul Icard, director of the Institute of Industrial Sale Psychology, with the goal of training "business executives adapted to the methods of modern business." The ISC Paris was a non-profit association (law 1901) with a Board of Directors. Students were eligible for admission immediately after the earning their baccalaureate; initially the duration of study was two years. The first promotion (promo 64) was composed of thirty-eight male students. Founded in early 1963, the Board of Students of the ISC Paris directed student life and activities at the school. Extracurricular activities were a core part of the professional degrees. In 1969, the Board of Students separated from the school administration and incorporated as a separate, non-profit association. In 1970 the "Junior Enterprise" of the ISC Paris was founded.

On 19 May 1969 ISC Paris was recognized by the State in a ministerial decree. Simultaneously, it moved to new premises at 13 rue Jacques Bingen in the 17th arrondissement. The school had a student body of approximately one hundred students at the time. In 1971 the length of the course of study was increased by a year to three years. Also in 1971, admission to the school was closed to those who had only earned their baccalaureate, requiring an additional year of preparation. The same year admission to the *Institut supérieur du commerce de Paris* was opened to women.

In 1975, ISC Paris moved to its current location at 22 Boulevard du Fort de Vaux, occupying an area of 2200 m² offering amenities such as a language laboratory, group study rooms, conference rooms, and a computer lab. The entry examination was thereafter opened to parallel admissions to students with 2 to 4-year post-baccalaureate university degrees. In 1976 there were nearly one thousand applicants to the business school. ISC Paris subsequently chose to open examination centers in regional provinces with the support of local chambers of commerce and high schools.

On 21 May 1980 a decree of the Ministry of Education announced that the ISC Paris's degree was guaranteed by the State. In 1981 a Department for Continuing Professional Education was established, offering training solutions to businesses. This was followed by the creation of ISC Master Program for graduate students. The *Institut Superieur du Commerce* was rebranded as the ISC Group. In 1983, the entry examination in the first year was opened to applicants with a 2 years degree, in order to increase the pool of applicants. In October 1983, ISC Paris inaugurated new premises close to the Boulevard du Fort de Vaux. The school grounds expanded, eventually covering over 3000 m².

The number of applicants to the ISC Paris increased as a result of the actions of the School Promotion Committee organizing conferences in preparatory classes across France. In 1992, ISC Paris created a series of examinations with a partner business school with identical written tests, but different oral exams for each school. This system lasted until 1999, when the ISC Paris decided to join the Banque Commune d'épreuves (Examination test base for most Business Schools). Meanwhile, in 1996, ministry-led reforms increased the duration of preparatory classes from one to two years. The number of candidates reached 1 178 in 1982, 2 281 in 1984 and 3 875 in 1992. In 2010, the number of applicants reached more than 2,900 applicants from HEC preparatory classes and about 2,700 via the parallel admission process in 2011.

In March 2007, the ISC Paris was authorized to award master's degree as part of the LMD Europe-wide Bologna process to its students by the Helfer Committee and joined the Conference of Grandes Ecoles.

As of 2 September 2019, Jean-Paul Aimetti was President of the Board of Directors and Jean-Christophe Hauguel was the Chief Executive Officer.

On 19 October 2019, the Business School joined the Principles for Responsible Management Education, an initiative by the United Nations Global Compact.
