**Saman Bank** (Persian: بانک سامان, *Bank Saman*) is a privately owned Iranian bank. It is listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange.

## History

This bank started its activities as Credit Institution in September 1999. Subsequently, in August 2002, it received a full banking license and changed its name to Saman Bank. Saman Eqtesad Credit Corporation was established on September 23, 1999 with a share capital of 11 bln Iranian Rials (US$1.4m).
It opened its first branch on November 22, 1999. In 2002, Saman was the third private financial institution in post-revolutionary Iran to receive a banking license. In this context, the share capital increased to Rials 220 bln (US$26 mln).

In March 2007, Saman Bank had a paid-sup share capital of Rials 900 bln (US$97 mln). It operated 149 branches across Iran.

Saman Bank also launched the first internet banking service in Iran, and has since been at the forefront of expansion and enhancement of electronic banking.

In 2024, Saman Bank was hit by a cyberattack from IRLeaks, which affected 20 of Iran's 29 banks, including the Central Bank of Iran. Politico called it the "worst attack" in the nation's history.
