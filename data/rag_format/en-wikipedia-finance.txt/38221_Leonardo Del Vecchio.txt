## Life and career

Leonardo Del Vecchio was born on 22 May 1935 in Milan, Italy to an impoverished family from Barletta, Southern Italy. His father was a street vendor of vegetables who died before his birth and his mother already had four other children; he grew up in an orphanage. He began his career as an apprentice to a tool and die maker in Milan, but decided to turn his metalworking skills to make spectacle parts. In 1961, he moved to Agordo in the province of Belluno, which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry. The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
