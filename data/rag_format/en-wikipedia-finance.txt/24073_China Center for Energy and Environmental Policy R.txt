China Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research


# China Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research



The **China Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research**, better known as **China CEEP**, was founded in 2009. It is a Chinese think tank that conducts research on energy economics, climate policy and environmental management. Armed with qualitative and quantitative tools, it aims to provide a scientific basis for public and private decisions in strategy planning and management that are needed to cope with China's increasing demand for energy, as well as the challenges of adapting to and mitigating climate change. China CEEP also serves as a professional education center and a platform for international exchange in the area of energy and environmental policy research.

The current director of China CEEP, Prof. Yi-Ming Wei, established the CAS-CNPC Joint Center for Energy and Environmental Policy in 2006, and held the founding director. The core research team then joined BIT and continued to contribute research, education and international communication in the fields of energy and environmental policy.


## Background to its development

The energy problem has already evolved into an important strategic issue due to its influence on human development and the world political and economic situation. Energy systems involve a high degree of complexity, uncertainty and constant change. The coordination of the development of these energy systems along with the economy, society, and environmental regulation is an important part of China's energy economics and energy systems management. At present, it's particularly urgent to carry out energy economics and energy systems management research by establishing a complex, but realistic system model according to related theory, method and technology. Modern mathematical economics (economic mathematics) provides a theoretical basis for energy modeling. Meanwhile, the optimization and overall planning of modern management science also provide method basis for energy modeling. Furthermore, modern computer science and information communication technology form an excellent platform for the model computation.


## China CEEP and SCOPE

The *Chinese Society of Optimization, Overall Planning and Economic Mathematics* (SCOPE) is an academic social group which works directly under the *China Association for Science and Technology* (CAST). As a top-level Chinese organization, SCOPE plays a pivotal role in the development of China's management science and technology, initiated by the famous mathematician professor Luo-Geng Hua. SCOPE aims to connect scientific workers who take up management science specializing in such fields as optimization, overall planning, economic mathematics, and so on. Many academics in SCOPE have carried out a large number of basic and applied research projects in energy economics and in the management field by energy system modeling and have achieved fruitful research results.

Based on the current research on energy system modeling of SCOPE, the Society of Energy Economics and Management of SCOPE will continue to carry out energy modeling and quantitative research by employing economics mathematics, optimization and overall planning approach, and provides a scientific basis for energy policy. In the world, energy modeling and quantitative analysis have been an important means of energy economics and management research. For instance, to this end, department of management science and engineering, Stanford University has set up the world-famous energy modeling forum. The forum has provided a good scientific research and academic communication platform for those on energy economics and management research for thirty years. To promote the development of domestic energy modeling, the Society of Energy Economics and Management of SCOPE also focus on providing a platform on energy system modeling for domestic energy researchers.


## History of its founding

The *Chinese Institute of Energy Economics and Management* (CIEEM) was formally founded with the approval of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of China on Dec. 18, 2009. It is affiliated with CEEP and the Beijing Institute of Technology.

The 2nd workshop on energy economics & management and funding ceremony of the society of energy economics & management of SCOPE was established in Beijing Institute of Technology on November 20, 2010. More than 100 leaders, experts and scholars attended the conference and they came from more than 50 places, including Research Office of State Council, Energy Research Institute National Development and Reform Commission, Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, China Association for Science and Technology, SCOPE, Department of Management Science of NSFC, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Royal Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University and China National Petroleum Corporation et al., of which there were 28 host from National Natural Science Foundation Project (energy economics and management field).

Prof. Shu-Xing Yang, vice-chancellor of the Beijing Institute of Technology, director Lie-Xun Yang of the Department of Management Science of NSFC, and Prof. Jin-Lin Li, party secretary of the School of Management and Economics, BIT, attended and briefed the conference. Former chairman of SCOPE and former director of Institute of Policy and Management, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Prof. Wei-Xuan, Xu read out the approval document from the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

Former director of Energy Research Institute National Development and Reform Commission and vice director of National energy experts consultation committee, Prof. Da-Di Zhou, Vice Dean of the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, Prof. Jin-Nan Wang and director of Department of Management Science of NSFC, Prof. Lie-Xun Yang made presentations titled "*China's Energy Strategy*" and *"'12 5' Energy Development"*, coal consumption amount control under the restriction of the environment and NSFC funded economic management and energy policy respectively. Supported by the second batch of The Recruitment Program of Global Experts and as the editor of Applied Energy, a world-famous academic periodical in energy field, Prof. Jerry Jinyue Yan from the Royal Institute of Technology introduced the Applied Energy and the preparatory work of International Conference of Applied Energy in May 2011.

Chinese Institute of Energy Economics and Management (CIEEM) of SCOPE was formally approved by Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People's Republic of China and founded on Dec. 18, 2009. CIEEM is attached in the CEEP-BIT. The conference is organized by CIEEM and operated by CEEP-BIT, School of Management and Economics, Chinese Committee for Energy Economics and Department of Management Science of NSFC. Moreover, the conference was supported by Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Xiangsu university, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astro, China University of Mining and North China Electric Power University and so on.

The conference elected members of the first board of Chinese Institute of Energy Economics and Management of SCOPE. Prof. Yi-Ming Wei, director of CEEP-BIT and Vice President of SCOPE, was elected the President of CIEEM of SCOPE, and Prof. Zhao-Hua Wang, vice director of CEEP-BIT, was the secretary general.
