Bull (2000 TV series)


# Bull (2000 TV series)



***Bull*** is an American drama series created by Michael S. Chernuchin that aired on TNT from August 15, 2000, to January 31, 2001. The show's name is in reference to the bull market, but the airing of the series coincided with the dot-com bubble crash that turned what had until then been a bull economy in the United States into a bear market. In February 2001 the series was cancelled after airing 12 of the planned 20 episodes.


## Synopsis

*Bull* is about a group of Wall Street investment bankers who risk everything to break away from an established firm and start their own company. Leading the way is Robert "Ditto" Roberts III, the brilliant grandson of the founder of their former company who must betray his family heritage in order to stake a claim to his own life. His partners—Corey Granville, Marty Decker, Carson Boyd, Alison Jeffers and Marissa Rufo—each with a separate agenda, risk losing everything to join him in the new rival start-up firm that will answer the call of the new economy. With no financing, no clients and the rivalry of every player in town, the team's dreams rest on Hunter Lasky, the hard-hitting negotiations shark who has the potential to give the renegade team of Wall Street brokers the edge and legitimacy they need to succeed in the competitive world of high finance.
