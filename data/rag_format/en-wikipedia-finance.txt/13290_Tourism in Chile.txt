Tourism in Chile


# Tourism in Chile

 

Since the mid-1990s, **tourism in Chile** has become one of the main sources of income for the country, especially in its most extreme areas. In 2005, this sector grew by 13.6%, generating more than US$500 million, equivalent to 1.33% of the national GDP.

According to the World Tourism Organization (WTO), Chile was the eighth most popular destination for foreign tourists within the Americas in 2010, after the United States, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. That year, 2,766,000 tourists entered the country, generating a revenue of US$1,636 million. The majority of these visitors came from American countries, mainly Argentina; however, the biggest growth in recent years has been in visitors from Europe, especially Germany.

In 2017, a record total of 6,449,993 international tourists visited Chile, a 13.3% increase from 2016. Argentina remained the most common country of origin, followed by Brazil. European tourists were third in terms of total numbers. The average tourist stayed for 10 nights. The Chilean government attributes the rise in tourism to "promotional campaigns, the development of new products and tourist destinations and a renewed diversification of experiences."

Tourism for the year 2018 was projected to continue the increase in visitors, with more than 7 million international tourists estimated to travel to Chile. Online guidebook Lonely Planet has listed Chile as its number 1 destination to visit in 2018. Lonely Planet emphasizes visiting the city of Valparaiso, the northern Atacama Desert, and Patagonia to the south. However, in 2018 and 2019, the Chilean tourism industry was plunged into a deep crisis by the adverse effects of internal unrest and the Argentine monetary crisis. As a consequence, Chile saw international tourism arrivals fall by more than 20% in 2019, to about 4.5 million. The following year, the COVID-19 pandemic caused further disruption to the Chilean tourism sector, with a fall of 85.7% on 2019 and total visitors estimated at 1,122,858. In 2021, just 161,000 foreigners visited Chile.


## Geographic overview

Occupying the southwest part of South America, Chile is normally divided into three geographic areas:

* Continental Chile comprises a long and narrow strip of land on the west coast of the Southern Cone that extends between the parallels 17°29'57"S and Diego Ramírez Islands at 56°32'12"S, mostly from the southeastern shore of the Pacific Ocean to the Andes, across 4270 km
* Insular Chile corresponds to a set of islands volcanic origin in the South Pacific Ocean: the Juan Fernández archipelago and Desventuradas Islands, belonging to South America, the Salas y Gómez Island and Easter Island, geographically located in the Polynesia.
* The Chilean Antarctic Territory, is an area of Antarctica of 1,250,257.6 km² between meridians 53°W and 90°W on which Chile claims sovereignty, extending its southern boundary to the South Pole. Because of its presence in the Americas, Oceania and Antarctica, Chile describes itself as a tricontinental country.

The latitudinal width of the country, which spans over 39° (over 72° if the Chilean Antarctic Territory is included) its elevation and influence of the Pacific Ocean are the main factors behind the climatic variety and landscape of Chile, which determines the development of the formation of different ecosystems in the country.

The main Chilean attractions are the 6,435 km long coast, the Andean Ski resorts, the mountains and volcanoes, and the islands and archipelagos, including Easter Island.

The country has 14 natural monuments, 36 National Parks, 10 biosphere reserves, 52 natural reserves, 39 sanctuaries of Nature, and 12 Ramsar wetlands, mainly in the extreme parts of the country.

Its most notable feature is the over 1,000 enormous and mysterious statues known as moai, which have been shrouded in mystery since their discovery. To preserve these characteristics, the government has designated, through the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF), the island as Rapa Nui National Park, while UNESCO declared this park as a World Heritage Site in 1995. It is named Easter Island because it was discovered on Easter Sunday in 1722.
