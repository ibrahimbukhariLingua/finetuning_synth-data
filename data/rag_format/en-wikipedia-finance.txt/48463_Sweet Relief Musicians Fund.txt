Sweet Relief Musicians Fund


# Sweet Relief Musicians Fund



***Sweet Relief Musicians Fund*** is a nonprofit charity that maintains a financial fund from which professional musicians can draw when in need of medical care or financial needs. Initially intended as a one-time CD launch benefit for Victoria Williams, Sweet Relief has evolved into a charity organization that relies on donations from artists and the public as a general fund to all professional musicians in need. The fund provides financial assistance to all types of career musicians who are struggling with their finances while facing illness, disability, or age-related problems.


## History


### Founding and first CD release

The organization was started after musician and singer Victoria Williams was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1993 and had no way to pay for her medical expenses. Money was raised through benefit concerts and the release of a CD, *Sweet Relief: A Benefit for Victoria Williams*, featuring artists like Lou Reed and Pearl Jam.


### Second CD release

A second CD titled *Sweet Relief II: Gravity of the Situation* was released in 1996. All of the proceeds went toward Sweet Relief Musicians Fund to aid the organization. A variety of alternative rock artists volunteered their time to perform a variety of songs from Vic Chesnutt. Some well-known artists including Garbage, R.E.M., Hootie and the Blowfish, The Smashing Pumpkins, Joe Henry and Madonna performed for the CD.
