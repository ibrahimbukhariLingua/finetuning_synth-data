Institute for Business and Professional Ethics


# Institute for Business and Professional Ethics



The **Institute for Business and Professional Ethics** (IBPE) is a business ethics research and development center within the Driehaus College of Business at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1985 in a joint effort between DePaul University's College of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences and Driehaus College of Business to encourage ethical deliberation in decision-makers by stirring their moral conscience, encouraging moral imagination, and stimulating research into business innovation and practices. IBPE programming serves as a forum for exploring and fostering ethical practices by the business community as well as for DePaul students and faculty.
The IBPE publishes case studies, books, and journal articles in business ethics, and hosts a series of annual business workshops, conferences and events. It is also the editorial home of the *Business and Professional Ethics Journal*.

## Patricia H. Werhane Business Ethics Scholarship

Through the generous gifts from Professor Patricia H. Werhane and many of her colleagues, the Patricia H.

B Academics also hosts annual roundtables, webinars and workshops. IBPE Executive Director Summer Brown currently serves as a board member and secretary.


## "Big Questions"

Inspired by the prospect of video case studies several years ago, the Institute partnered with the late DePaul College of Communication faculty member Kim Clark to create a documentary television series focusing on issues of social justice and poverty alleviation.

"Big Questions" is part documentary, part talk show, and engages with some of the world's most critical challenges. Patricia Werhane and Kim Clark served as hosts, each bringing years of experience and knowledge to help shed light on new ideas and projects that are changing the way the world works.

The stories range from Chicago-focused issues such as food deserts and national issues like criminal recidivism, to international topics of health care in Ghana and Tanzania, and microlending in Bangladesh.

The series won a 2015 Chicago/Midwest Emmy award.
