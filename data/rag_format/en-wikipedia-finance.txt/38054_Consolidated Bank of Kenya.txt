## History

The Bank was incorporated in 1989, as a result of the merger of the following nine insolvent financial institutions:

3. Kenya Savings and Mortgages Limited
4. Estate Finance Company of Kenya Limited
5. Estate Building Society
6. Business Finance Company Limited
7. Citizen Building Society
8. Nationwide Finance Company Limited
9. Home Savings and Mortgages Limited

Consolidated Bank aims to meet the banking needs of both individuals and institutions. In the beginning, the institution was limited to collecting the debts of the failed legacy financial institutions. However, the Central Bank of Kenya, issued CBKL with a full commercial banking license in 2001.

With decades of banking experience and a special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, it is in a strong position to help growing businesses unlock their potential and sail through the complexities they may face.

Banking services include current accounts, savings accounts, fixed and call deposits, loan and overdraft facilities, local and overseas money transfer services, and local and international trade finance. The bank is also active on the local inter-bank money market.
