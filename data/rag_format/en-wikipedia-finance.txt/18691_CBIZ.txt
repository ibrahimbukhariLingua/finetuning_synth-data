## History

In 1987, Stout Environmental, Inc. ("Stout") was formed as a Delaware corporation. It was acquired by Republic Industries in 1992. In April 1995, Republic Industries spun off the business into an entity known as Republic Environmental Systems, which was merged with Century Surety Company (which was part of Alliance Holding Corporation) into a newly formed entity, International Alliance Services, Inc. (Nasdaq: IASI) in October 1996. In 1997, IASI sold its environmental services operations and changed its name to Century Business Services, Inc. (NYSE: CBZ) in December 1997. In 1998, Century Business acquired Beall Garner Screen & Geare Inc., one of the largest privately owned insurance agencies in the United States (formerly run by U.S. Senator J. Glenn Beall Jr.). The company changed its name to CBIZ, Inc. in August 2005.

Since 1998, CBIZ and CBIZ CPAs (formerly known as Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C.) have operated an alternative practice structure in which they act as separate, independent legal entities that work together to provide accounting services to clients, sharing a tax and consulting practice, CBIZ MHM LLC, which is a division of CBIZ.
