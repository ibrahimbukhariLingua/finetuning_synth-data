### Political career


#### Congressman

In 2016, Olaechea ran for Congress representing Lima under the Peruvians for Change parliamentary list, also serving as a part of the technical team for presidential nominee, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. He ultimately was elected Congressman for the 2016-2021 term, obtaining a majority of 41,669 votes.

In Congress, he was appointed Vice Chairman of the Budget Committee. He is also a full member of the Defense Committee and heads the Special Multiparty Committee in charge of Legislative Planning (CEMOL). His good relationship with the Popular Force legislators, who make up the majority parliamentary group, has been highlighted.

In 2018, he quit the Peruvians for Change parliamentary group and founded the short-lived Concertación Parlamentaria group, proceeding to form the Republican Action group afterwards. He is considered one of the most conservative congressmen to date, due to his strong opposition to the "gender ideology" teachings in the national educational curriculum.

In 2019, he was elected to the Presidency of the Congress, defeating Daniel Salaverry's reelection ticket, receiving the support of the entire Popular Force party and numerous parliamentary groups of the opposition, although his ticket is composed of three Vice-Presidents from different factions.


#### Kuczynski administration

Olaechea was appointed Minister of Production on 25 May 2017, succeeding Bruno Giuffra who was transferred to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Serving during the first phase of the 2017–19 Peruvian political crisis, his tenure ended with the recomposition of the Cabinet after the failed impeachment process against President Kuczynski and promise of instituting a "Reconciliation Cabinet", due to the controversial pardon of former president Alberto Fujimori.


#### Later career

Olaechea would sign the *Madrid Charter*, becoming a member of the Vox-organized international alliance of right-wing and far-right individuals.
