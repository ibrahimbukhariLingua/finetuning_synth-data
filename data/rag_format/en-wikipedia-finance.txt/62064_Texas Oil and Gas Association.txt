## Positions


### Climate change

In an April 2020 statement by association head Todd Staples, the group acknowledged the existence of global warming and the fossil fuel industry's role in it. This is a surprising reversal for Staples, who was previously part of coalitions attempting to block regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. The local public radio station KUT attributed to this change in position to an attempt to stay in line with American Petroleum Institute attempts to focus on Carbon capture and storage instead of climate change mitigation practices which shift away from a petroleum economy.
