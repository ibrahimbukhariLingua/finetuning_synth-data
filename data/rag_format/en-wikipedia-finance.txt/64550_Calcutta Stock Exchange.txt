## History and timeline

In 1830, bourse activities in Kolkata were conducted under a neem tree. The earliest record of dealings in securities in India records trading of the British East India Companyâ€™s loan stock. The exchange was founded on 1 December 1863 by sixteen leading stockbrokers, beginning life in rented premises on 11 Strand Road. The premises also had a library, open to the public, which could be accessed after paying an admission fee. In 1908, the stock exchange was reconstituted in its current form, and had 150 members. The present building at the Lyons Range was constructed in 1928. The Calcutta Stock Exchange Ltd was granted permanent recognition by the Government of India with effect from 14 April 1980, under the relevant provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. The Calcutta Stock Exchange followed the open outcry system for stock trading until 1997, when it was replaced by C-STAR (CSE Screen Based Trading And Reporting), an electronic trading platform.

The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has made a strategic investment in the Calcutta Stock Exchange, acquiring 5% of its shares.
