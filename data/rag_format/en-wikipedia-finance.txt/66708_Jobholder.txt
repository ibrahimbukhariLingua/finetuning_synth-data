Jobholder


# Jobholder



A **jobholder** is a new type of employment status in UK labour law, that was introduced by the Pensions Act 2008, sections 1 and 88. Jobholders are entitled under the Act to be automatically enrolled in an occupational pension.


## Meaning

Section 1 of the Act reads:

> (1) For the purposes of this Part a jobholder is a workerâ€”
> 
> (a) who is working or ordinarily works in Great Britain under the worker's contract,
> (b) who is aged at least 16 and under 75, and
> (c) to whom qualifying earnings are payable by the employer in the relevant pay reference period (see sections 13 and 15).

In turn, section 88 defines a worker in the same way as the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 230, as someone either with a "contract of employment" (on which, see *Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher*) or someone who personally performs work but is not a client or a customer.


## Consequence

The concept of jobholder was a fifth type of employment status in UK labour law. It joins,

* "employee" under ERA 1996 section 230, see *Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher*
* "worker" under ERA 1996 section 230
* "employment relationship" under EU law
* "worker" under EU law, see *Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz*

In the ERA 1996 section 205A, the government also created a new "employee shareholder" status, although the takeup of this was so poor that it has no practical relevance.
