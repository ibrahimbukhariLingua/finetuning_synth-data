## History

Atacadão was founded in 1962, in the city of Maringá in Paraná, by Alcides Parizotto, who was in charge of the network until 1991, the year he left the organization, and in which the company was later acquired by the Lima family and executives Farid Curi and Herberto Uli Schmeil, when it was purchased in 2007 by Carrefour Group for R$2.2 billion reais.

In 2020, the retail chain Carrefour acquired 30 stores from Makro, aiming to increase Atacadão's market share. The acquisition cost Carrefour R$1.95 billion and included 14 gas stations in the package. The transaction would allow Atacadão to expand its presence in Rio de Janeiro and the Northeast.

In January 2023, Carrefour announced that it would relocate one of its stores in the commune of Sevran, France, as part of its strategy to target low-income populations. On 16 January, the city's mayor, Stéphane Blanchet, called Carrefour's choice disastrous. In the following months, the city government launched a petition, promoted discussions, and scheduled a demonstration for 11 March. But the mayor of the city of Aulnay-sous-Bois, Bruno Beschizza, embraced the idea, although the population of the commune also launched a petition.

On 20 June 2024 a first store opened in France, at the O'Parinor shopping center in Aulnay-sous-Bois, Seine-Saint-Denis, which is seen as a response to the impact of inflation on the purchasing power of the French population.
