In 2022, Mansour was awarded an honorary doctorate by North Carolina State University and made "Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters".


## Career

With his two brothers, Mansour maintained an active role in the Mansour Group, the family business, building close ties as distributors for US companies including Caterpillar, General Motors, and McDonald's. Mansour has led the group since his father died in 1976, overseeing all the major corporate developments, including setting up the company's private investment subsidiary Man Capital in London in 2010.

In December 2005, Mansour resigned from his business responsibilities to serve as Minister of Transportation. Mansour resigned in October 2009 after a deadly train crash.

As of February 2023, Mansour had donated £600k to the Conservative Party (UK). He made a donation of £5 million that May. The then opposition Labour Party demanded Tory prime minister Rishi Sunak return Mansour's donation, after it emerged one of Mansour's companies, Mantrac had still been operating in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. In reply, Mantrac claimed it was winding down its business in Russia. In March 2024, Mansour received a knighthood from Sunak for contribution to business, charity and political service. The honour was criticised by opposing political parties and media outlets.
