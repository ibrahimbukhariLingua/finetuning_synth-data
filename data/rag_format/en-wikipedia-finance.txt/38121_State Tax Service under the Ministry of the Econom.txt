## History


### Ministry of Taxes

**The Ministry of the Taxes of Azerbaijan Republic** (Azerbaijani: *Azərbaycan Respublikası Vergilər Nazirliyi*) was the Azerbaijani executive agency that ensured the implementation of state tax policy until 2019 when it was replaced by the State Tax Service. Before it was replaced, its role included the timely and full collection of taxes and other revenues to the state budget, and exercised state control within the framework of a single financial and budgetary policy implemented in the Republic of Azerbaijan. On October 23, 2019, the Ministry of Taxes was dissolved and the State Tax Service was established under the Ministry of Economy (Azerbaijan).

First Tax Inspection under the Ministry of Finance of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was established by the decision of the Parliament dated 17 June 1919. Since that time the tax service began its activity.

From 1920 to 1991, tax matters in Azerbaijan were made part of the tax system of the Soviet Union.

After restoration of the independence in July 1990, a Tax Service was set up within the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan to ensure timely and full collection of taxes and other mandatory payments in the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as to ensure the state control over legal and physical persons' compliance with tax legislation and state pricing discipline.

In October 1991, Tax Service was separated from the Ministry of Finance for the purpose of improving supervision over compliance to tax legislation, strengthening the role of the state tax service in this area and ensuring the objectivity of its independent activities and supervision. As a result, the independent body, the State Tax Inspectorate of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established.

By the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 11 February 2000, the General State Tax Inspectorate was revoked and the Ministry of the Taxes was established to ensure proper state tax policy, timely and full collection of taxes and other mandatory payments as well as state control over that area.

A new complex of the Training Center was inaugurated in the village of Nagarakhana of Shamakhi on September 13, 2011, with the participation of the President Ilham Aliyev.
