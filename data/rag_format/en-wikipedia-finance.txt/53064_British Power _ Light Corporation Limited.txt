British Power & Light Corporation Limited


# British Power & Light Corporation Limited



The **British Power and Light Corporation Limited,** also known as the British Power & Light Corporation (1929) Limited was registered in 1929 to acquire a controlling interest in electricity undertakings in North Wales; East Suffolk; South Somerset; Trent Valley and High Peak; West Hampshire; and Ringwood, Hampshire. The corporation operated for 19 years and was abolished upon the nationalisation of the British electricity supply industry in 1948.


## Background

The British Power & Light Corporation Limited was registered on 7 May 1929 as a holding company by a group of British merchant bankers to assume control of, and develop, a number of electricity undertakings in England and Wales.

The inaugural board of directors were:

* Henry Augustus Vernet
* Edward de Stein
* Constatine Evelyn Benson
* Gerald William Partridge
* George Victor Twiss (managing director)

The company's registered office was 27 Old Broad Street, London EC2.

After establishment the British Power and Light Corporation acquired a controlling interest in two companies:

* The North Wales Power Company Limited
* Electricity Distribution of North Wales and District Limited

In addition, it acquired the whole of the share capital of five electricity undertakings:

* East Suffolk Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (Orford undertaking)
* South Somerset and District Electricity Co. Ltd.
* Trent Valley and High Peak Electricity Co. Ltd. (Chapel-en-le-Frith and Rugeley undertakings)
* West Hampshire Electricity Co. Ltd.
* Ringwood Electric Supply Co. Ltd.

The British Power & Light Corporation was one of a number of electricity holding companies that had a wide and disparate geographical range of interests. Other such companies included: Christy Bros. and Company Limited; Edmundsons Electricity Corporation Limited ; Electrical Finance and Securities Company Limited; Midland Counties Electric Supply Company Limited.


## North Wales Companies

The North Wales Power Company had increased its sales and revenue during the 1920s:

| Year | Electricity sold, Gwh | Revenue£, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1921 | 7 | 29,263 |
| 1922 | 8 | 34,726 |
| 1923 | 12 | 59,247 |
| 1924 | 14 | 71,771 |
| 1925 | 19 | 87,787 |
| 1926 | 30 | 145,801 |
| 1927 | 38 | 168,770 |
| 1928 | 42 | 180,416 |

However, the company's profits had not been commensurate with its capital because of a shortage of generating plant (only 5.5 MW). This meant that electricity had to be purchased.

The North Wales Power Company owned three hydro-electric power stations:

* Cwm Dyli, commissioned in 1906, output 5 MW,
* Dolgarrog, No.1 station commissioned in 1909 and No.2 station in 1925, total output 17.6 MW,
* Maentwrog, commissioned in 1928, output 24 MW.

To raise capital from its inception the British Power & Light Corporation offered 1,600,000 shares of £1 each on the Stock Exchange in May 1929.

The gross revenue of the North Wales company from the sale of electricity rose steadily during the 1930s, as shown:
