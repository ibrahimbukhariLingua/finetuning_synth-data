## History

National School of Business Management was founded in 2011 as the degree awarding university under the National Institute of Business Management to award undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. Followed by a series of government protocols, the approval was granted to set up a higher education institute named National School of Business Management (NSBM). It was registered as a limited company under the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007. The first board of directors of the company was appointed in July 2011, consisting of 5 members. In the wake of the discussions about the location of the proposed institute, a land of 26 acres in Pitipana, Homagama was selected and later obtained in December 2011. The NSBM Green University Town project's construction work officially began at an investment of 10.2 billion LKR in 2013, after clearing government sanctions and approvals. While the construction was underway, NSBM commenced its operations as a city campus.

NSBM city campus was launched in Nugegoda with a modest organizational structure consisting of School of Business, School of Computing, Finance Division, and Administration Division. On 25 February 2012, it officially began the education delivery process inaugurating the first set of students for the University College Dublin and the UGC approved degree programs. Later the same year, the city campus expanded its presence with the addition of three new buildings in close proximity to the main building. Over the period of the next four years since its inception, the city campus continued till it was moved to NSBM Green University Town premises. Along the way, more undergraduate and postgraduate degrees programs and new academic partnerships were added to the NSBM profile. These comprise the Management, Computing, Engineering, and Design degrees offered by NSBM or affiliated with Plymouth University, UK, Victoria University, Australia and Limkokwing University of Creative Technology, Malaysia.

The construction of the NSBM Green University Town was carried out by MAGA Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd together with the design and consultation of Engineering Consultancy (Pvt.) Ltd. On 26 October 2016, the newly constructed university complex was ceremonially declared open, concluding a construction project spanned over two years and ten months.

NSBM commenced the construction of Phase II of the NSBM Green University Project in 2021, adding another 14 acres adjoining the university premises. This new addition plans to house several new facilities including three new faculties: Medicine, Law, and Health Science. Moreover, NSBM envisions Phase III developments in another 20 acres of land, which will include infrastructure for medical and engineering studies.
