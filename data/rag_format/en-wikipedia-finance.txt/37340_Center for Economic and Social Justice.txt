Center for Economic and Social Justice


# Center for Economic and Social Justice



**The Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ)** is a non-profit, educational and research institution organized under § 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. The think tank is registered as a non-stock corporation in Washington, DC, and located in Arlington, Virginia, U.S. Founded in 1984, CESJ studies, promotes, and develops programs incorporating a free enterprise approach to global economic justice through expanded capital ownership.


## Mission and philosophy

CESJ's stated mission is to “advance liberty and justice for every person through equal opportunity and access to the means to become a capital owner.” Its approach is based on a synthesis of - the social doctrine of Pope Pius XI as analyzed by CESJ co-founder the late Reverend William J. Ferree, S.M., Ph.D., detailed in The Act of Social Justice (1943) and Introduction to Social Justice (1948), and the economic justice principles developed by lawyer-economist Louis O. Kelso and Aristotelian philosopher Mortimer J. Adler in their two books, *The Capitalist Manifesto* (1958) and *The New Capitalists* (1961). ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ CESJ considers the subtitle of the latter — “A Proposal to Free Economic Growth from the Slavery of Savings” — to be particularly significant in its challenging of the fundamental assumption of Keynesian economics that the only way to finance new capital is to cut consumption and accumulate money savings. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
Many CESJ members and supporters do not agree that the terms “capitalist” and “capitalism” accurately describe the system Kelso and Adler framed. Karl Marx and the socialists, they claim, invented these terms to condemn what they saw as the inherent greed, exploitation, and injustices inherent in a system where the powers and profits of land and productive assets became concentrated within a tiny elite of private owners. To remedy the abuses of concentrated capital ownership, Marx and Engels in *The Communist Manifesto* (1848) declared, “[T]he theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: the abolition of private property.” ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In contrast, Kelso turned the socialist's central assumption around by asserting that private property, far from being the problem, is essential for creating a truly just free market global economy. An economically just economy is one in which every citizen can be a capital owner without taking property away from the currently wealthy (whom the system allowed to monopolize ownership of increasingly productive labor displacing-technologies). ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

CESJ defines capitalism as "a system in which proprietary rights to profits and control over capital assets is concentrated in a small private elite", and socialism as "a system in which capital ownership or control is vested in the State". In both systems most people are dependent on wages and welfare for subsistence. CESJ prefers the term "Just Third Way" to describe the Kelsonian alternative. According to CESJ, "the Just Third Way is a system based on equality in which capital is broadly owned instead of concentrated, and everyone has equality of opportunity to gain personal income from private property rights both from one's human (or labor) contributions and one's non-human (or capital) contributions to the productive process". ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

CESJ bases its policies and programs on respect for human dignity and "sovereignty of the person." This is realized through empowering every individual economically and politically with non-coercive means to acquire direct ownership of capital. Citing the example of leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), CESJ points out how capital can be and has been acquired by new owners through personal access to capital credit designed to be repayable with the future earnings of the capital itself. Access to such credit and other non-redistributive social means can be universalized by reforming specific institutions of society (see the section below under “Capital Homesteading”). ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## History


### Alexandria Tire Company (Egypt)

In 1990, Norman G. Kurland, CESJ's president, headed the team that implemented the world's first ESOP (called a “Workers Shareholders Association” under a new Egyptian law) in a developing country for the Alexandria Tire Company using funds provided by USAID. Writing to The Wall Street Journal, Melanie Tammen of the Competitive Enterprise Institute cited the Alexandria Tire Company as the sole worthy achievement in USAID's record of aid to Egypt.


### Capital Homesteading

In 1982 Norman G. Kurland (later president of CESJ) wrote a concept paper on the “Capital Homestead Act” at the request of Dr. Norman Bailey, then-Chief Economist for International Affairs of the National Security Council. Conceived as a “New Marshall Plan” for stimulating rapid, non-inflationary growth, the proposal contained Federal Reserve, tax and other expanded capital ownership reforms intended to enable each citizen to accumulate a “capital homestead” of income-generating assets sufficient to meet ordinary living expenses and reduce over time the growing costs of unsustainable Federal entitlement spending.

The Capital Homesteading concept was an expansion of the “Second Income Plan” (later called “The Industrial Homestead Act”) developed by Louis O. Kelso and Walter Lawrence in 1965. Referring to Kelso's ideas, then-Governor Ronald Reagan declared in 1974 that “Lincoln signed the Homestead Act. . . . We need an Industrial Homestead Act.” The Kelso Plan to make every citizen an owner was renamed the “Capital Homestead Act” in CESJ's Capital Homesteading for Every Citizen (2004).


### Communications

Since its founding, CESJ has made as a central part of its mission the dissemination of what it believes is a radical advance in moral philosophy and market economics. Much of CESJ's work involves educating others through writings, meetings, seminars and its web site, about a new global paradigm, which CESJ calls “the Just Third Way.”
