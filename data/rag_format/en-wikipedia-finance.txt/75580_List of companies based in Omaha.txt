## Overview

Although Nebraska's economy is still primarily based on agriculture, Omaha's economy today has diversified to become a national leader in several industries, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, architecture/construction and transportation. Omaha's economy has grown dramatically since the early 1990s. The city has five companies that rank in the Fortune 500. It also is the smallest city to have two major research hospitals, the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Creighton University Medical Center.

Omaha's most prominent businessman is Warren Buffett, nicknamed the "Oracle of Omaha", who was ranked by *Forbes* magazine as the fourth richest man in the world (in 2013). He lives in a relatively modest home in the Dundee neighborhood west of downtown Omaha.
