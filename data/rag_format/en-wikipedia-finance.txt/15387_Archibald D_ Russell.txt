His paternal grandparents were Eleanor (née Oliver) Russell and Dr. James Russell, a former president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His mother was the only surviving child of his maternal grandparents, Dr. John Watts and Anna (née Rutherfurd) Watts (daughter of U.S. Senator John Rutherfurd). Through his maternal grandfather, he was a great-grandson of Robert Watts (son of John Watts and brother of U.S. Representative John Watts) and Lady Mary Alexander (daughter of William Alexander, Lord Stirling).

He was educated at private schools in New York before entering the business world.

### Residences

In New York, the Russells lived at 34 East 36th Street. In 1903, Russell hired his brother William Hamilton Russell, a partner in the architecture firm of Clinton and Russell, to build Edgerstoune, a Tudor Revival mansion on his Princeton estate. Edgerstoune, which cost between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000 to construct, was located across the street from Drumthwacket the estate of his brother-in-law, Moses Taylor Pyne (and currently the official residence of the governor of New Jersey), and directly adjoining the estates of Junius Spencer Morgan, William T. White, and C. B. Lambert. After his death, the 274-acre Edgerstoune estate was sold by his son-in-law, Governor John Gilbert Winant, to Albert Robertshaw who planned a large real estate development with a country club. Less than a month later, it was sold to Professor John G. Hun, headmaster of the Hun School of Princeton for $350,000.
