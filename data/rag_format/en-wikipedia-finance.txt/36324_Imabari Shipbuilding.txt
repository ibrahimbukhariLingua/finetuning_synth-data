**Imabari Shipbuilding** (今治造船株式会社, *Imabari Zōsen kabushiki gaisha*) is a major Japanese ship building, marine engineering, and service company headquartered in Imabari, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.

It is Japan's largest shipbuilder both in terms of tonnage and sales revenue, with design, research, construction and ship repair facilities in Imabari, Marugame and at seven other integrated dockyard and manufacturing facilities across the Seto Inland Sea region.

Imabari Shipbuilding's products include the design, manufacture, purchase and sale of merchant ships, offshore engineering and ship life cycle services.

Imabari Shipbuilding also controls various subsidiaries related to the shipbuilding and shipping industries, including one of the largest Japanese ship owning, managing, and leasing (chartering) companies Shoei Kisen Kaisha, which manages and provides ships to shipping companies under long term charterparty agreements.

The company is privately held and tightly controlled and run by the Higaki family. In 2016 it reported commercial vessel production as measured by cargo-carrying capacity for a total of about 4 million tons, six times more than Mitsubishi Heavy and seven times more than Mitsui Engineering. Its revenue in that year totaled 373.4 billion yen ($3.43 billion). Globally, it boasts the fourth-largest market share, after South Korean rivals Hyundai Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering.
