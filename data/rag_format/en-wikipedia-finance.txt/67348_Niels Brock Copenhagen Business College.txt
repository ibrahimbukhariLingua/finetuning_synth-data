Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College


# Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College



**Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College**, usually referred to simply as **Niels Brock**, is a school of secondary education and post-secondary education in Copenhagen, Denmark. The school offers programmes within business and management including Vocational Education and Training (VET), Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX), Bachelor in Business Administration, Master in International Business Management, Master of Business Administration, and supplementary courses for adults seeking to maintain qualifications. It is an independent self-governing institution under the Danish education system, managed by a board composed of members from the business community in conjunction with a rector that oversees day-to-day operations.


## History

The school is the product of a merger between two educational institutions which were both founded in the 1880s. Copenhagen Business College (Danish: *Købmandsskolen i København*) was founded by the Association for the Education of Young Businessmen (Danish: *Foreningen til Unge Handelsmænds Uddannelse*) in 1881. From 1901, it was based in a building designed by Valdemar and Bernhard Ingemann and situated on the corner of Fiolstræde with Nørre Voldgade. The Brockian Business Schools (Danish: *De Brockske Handelsskoler*) were established in 1888 with funding left by the businessman Niels Brock in his will. In 1908, Copenhagen Business College took over the Brockian Business School but they continued as separate institutions under one management until their official merger when Copenhagen Business College became a self-governing institution in 1964. The name was changed to Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College in 1991. In 2009–2012, Copenhagen Business Academy was spun off as an independent institution along with vocational programmes that had previously been under Niels Brock, including Copenhagen Hospitality College and the Academy of Chemical and Biotechnical Science.


## Accreditation

Niels Brock Copenhagen Business College is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools to award the Post-Secondary Business Vocational Education and Training certificate and the Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration.
