## Scientific work

Von Zedtwitz's work is at the intersection of international business, innovation, and R&D Management. With collaborator Oliver Gassmann, he proposed a widely used behavioral model of evolution of global R&D organization based on internal organizational tension. He and Gassmann also formulated a supply-and-demand model for innovation globalization based external drivers, namely access to markets and access to technology. In managerial writings, he outlined support mechanisms appropriate to lead global innovation teams within such R&D organizations.

Early to study R&D in China, he co-developed theory of reverse innovation and innovation in emerging countries, both inbound R&D investments and management of innovation in China and outbound internationalization of R&D by Chinese firms. In this context, he refined organizational growth models for individual units as well as networks of units. He also contributed to the theory of global R&D flows, pharmaceutical innovation, and business incubator management.
