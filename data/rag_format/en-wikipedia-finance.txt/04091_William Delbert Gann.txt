# William Delbert Gann



**William Delbert Gann** (June 6, 1878 â€“ June 18, 1955) or **WD Gann**, was a finance trader who developed the technical analysis methods like the *Gann angles* and the *Master Charts*, where the latter is a collective name for his various tools like the Spiral Chart (also called the Square of Nine), the Hexagon Chart, and the Circle of 360. Gann's market forecasting methods are purportedly based on geometry, astronomy, astrology, time cycle analysis and ancient mathematics. Opinions are sharply divided on the value and relevance of his work. Gann authored a number of books and courses on shares and commodities trading.


## Biography

Gann was born on June 6, 1878, in Lufkin, Texas. His father was a cotton farmer. He started trading in 1902 when he was 24. He was believed to be a great student of the Bible, who believed that it was the greatest book ever written. He was also a 33rd degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite Order, to which some have attributed his knowledge of ancient mathematics, though he was also known to have studied the ancient Greek and Egyptian cultures.

## Writing style

Gann often wrote in an esoteric and indirect style that many found difficult to follow; it was supposed that he could be doing so deliberately to conceal his true method. For example, Patrick Mikula found that, in his course *How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities*, whenever Gann used the term "natural dates", he was indirectly referring to one of the following astrological phenomena:

1. Double ingresses (when two or more planets, not counting the Moon, enter a new sign within two consecutive days)
2. Stations (when a direct planet turns retrograde, or vice versa)
3. Declination of the Moon at extreme
4. Eclipses

In his private communication, Gann was much more direct and candid about his use of astrology. For example, in a private letter to a student, he openly demonstrated how he used planetary cycles to make predictions in the coffee market.


## Effectiveness

Gann's students have stated that he left a fortune of $50 million (equivalent to $569 million in 2023) that he built by following his methods, but evidence of such a fortune is lacking. Alexander Elder, in his book Trading for a Living, said "I interviewed W.D. Gann's son, an analyst for a Boston bank. He told me that his famous father could not support his family by trading but earned his living by writing and selling instructional courses. When W.D. Gann died in the 1950s, his estate, including his house, was valued at slightly over $100,000." Larry Williams, in the book The Right Stock at the Right Time, also stated he met W.D Gann's son. Larry Williams stated that John Gann said "He asked why if his dad was as good as everyone said, the son was still smiling and dialing calling up customers to trade". Larry Williams in the same book says "I also met F.B Thatcher who had been Gann's promoter and advance man who said that Gann was just a good promoter, not necessarily a good stock trader".
