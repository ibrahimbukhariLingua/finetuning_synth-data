## Controversies


### 2000 Transfer of state funds to Swiss Bank

On 22 March 2000, when he was part of the Labour-PMSD coalition, Xavier-Luc Duval's advisor Éric Stauffer made revelations about the transfer of large amounts of state funds belonging to Mauritius to a Swiss bank account. In preparation for the 1999 General Elections campaign Éric Stauffer also bought and shipped 3 fire-arms from Geneva to Mauritius. Although the fire-arms were illegal Duval managed to organise their clearance by Mauritian customs. Éric Stauffer also revealed that then Minister of Commerce Xavier-Luc Duval spent public taxpayers' funds to pay for international tourist trips during which Duval and his mistress Carole Hardy traveled to the Alps. Carole Hardy, the daughter of Miki Hardy, leader of religious sect *Église Chrétienne*, was also employed by Xavier-Luc Duval as his Communications Adviser. Mauritian authorities suspected *Église Chrétienne* to be also involved in child kidnappings. As a result Éric Stauffer could not return to Mauritius as he feared that Duval's partner Navin Ramgoolam would organise his arrest.


### 2009 more concerns about Église Chrétienne

In 2009 Opposition Leader Paul Bérenger raised his concerns in the press about the dangerous links between Xavier-Luc Duval's PMSD, the Tourism Authority, Events Mauritius and *Église Chrétienne*. Concerns had been raised about the role of a branch of *Église Chrétienne* called ASPA, as well as Church Team Ministries International (CTMI) as Carole Hardy's proximity to Xavier-Luc Duval made government bodies vulnerable to an infiltration risk.


### 2021 importation of Molnupiravir via MERCK

During the Private Notice Question (PNQ) session held on 9 November 2021 in the National Assembly the Minister of Health Kailesh Jagutpal revealed that private firm MERCK was the sole importer of anti-COVID drugs Molnupiravir and Ronapreve on the island of Mauritius.
