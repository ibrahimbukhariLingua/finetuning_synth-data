## Coverage and media


### Inclusion in research

If including central banks, postal savings and subsidiaries of foreign banking groups, the bank was ranked 10th (9th among retail and commercial conglomerates if omitting investment banks and insurance-bank conglomerates of Italy such as Banca Mediolanum and Mediobanca).


### Parmigiano Reggiano cheese wheels as collateral

Credito Emiliano has received widespread publicity from major organizations such as *Forbes*, because they hold wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as collateral for debt, as opposed to holding assets such as gold.

In fact, the bank itself is actually backed by the wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano, rather than bars of gold like conventional banks. The reason behind this is that Parmigiano Reggiano cheese not only holds its value, but it actually increases in value, because the more the cheese ages, the more delicious and valuable it becomes. According to the case, "Eighteen-month cheese gives pasta zing. Thirty-six-month cheese makes angels sing."
