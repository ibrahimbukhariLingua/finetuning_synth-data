## History

Sui Southern Gas Company's history goes back to Sui Gas Transmission Company (SGTC) which was established in 1954 to purchase natural gas from Pakistan Petroleum Limited, which had discovered natural gas in Sui, Balochistan in 1952. The company was responsible for transporting gas to Karachi and other intermediate markets via pipeline. The funding for SGTC came from multiple sources including Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC), Commonwealth Development Finance, Burmah Oil, and general public, with each entity investing approximately PKR 10 million. The remaining funding required, around PKR 90 million, was sourced through a $5 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).

The construction of the 347-mile pipeline with a 16-inch diameter and a capacity of 110 million cubic feet of gas per day was carried out by Pakistan Constructors, a joint venture between Morrison–Knudsen and William Press Ltd. The project commenced in July 1954 and was completed by April 1955. In 1955, it was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange following an initial public offering.

By September 1955, the pipeline was operational, distributing gas to consumers. In the Federal District, Karachi Gas Company was formed to handle local distribution, with a capital of PKR 15 million, funded equally by the public, PIDC, and Industrial Management Limited as the managing agents. Additionally, Indus Gas Company was established under the supervision of PIDC to distribute gas to regions outside the Federal Capital area, with managerial and technical support from Italian firm, Societe Nazionale Metanodotti (SNAM).

In March 1989, following a series of mergers of three companies, namely Sui Gas Transmission Company Limited, Karachi Gas Company Limited, and Indus Gas Company Limited, Sui Southern Gas Company was formed.
