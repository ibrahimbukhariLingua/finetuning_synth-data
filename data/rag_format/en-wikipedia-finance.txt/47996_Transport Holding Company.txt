Transport Holding Company


# Transport Holding Company



The **Transport Holding Company** (THC) was a British Government-owned company created by the Transport Act 1962 to administer a range of state-owned transport, travel and engineering companies that were previously managed by the British Transport Commission (BTC). It came into existence on 1 September 1962, with certain assets of the BTC vested in it on 1 January 1963.


## Assets

The THC's assets were very varied, reflecting its role as the manager of those investments that did not fit elsewhere in the post-1962 structure of nationalised transport. There were essentially six areas of activity:

* bus companies, some part-owned with the British Electric Traction Group, later acquired by the THC,
* bus manufacturing companies (Bristol Commercial Vehicles and Eastern Coach Works)
* road haulage companies, e.g. British Road Services (BRS) and Pickfords
* shipping lines, e.g. the BTC's shares in Associated Humber Lines and the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company
* travel agents (Thomas Cook and Son, to which Lunn Poly was later added)
* miscellaneous (the BTC's shares in the Penarth Dock Engineering Company)

## Demise

With the coming into effect of the Transport Act 1968 on 1 January 1969, the THC's road transport and shipping interests passed to the National Bus Company, the National Freight Corporation and the Scottish Transport Group. Its remaining assets were privatised and the company dissolved in the early 1970s.
