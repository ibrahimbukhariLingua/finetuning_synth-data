Sky Express (Russia)


# Sky Express (Russia)



**CJSC Sky Express** (Russian: ЗАО «Небесный Экспресс»), simply known as **Sky Express** and in Russian as ***Скай Экспресс***, was a Russian low-cost airline. Its main base was Vnukovo International Airport, Moscow, Russia. Sky Express was the first airline to focus on being a low-cost domestic airline in Russia. It operated from January 2007 until October 2011.


## History

The airline was established in March 2006 by a consortium of investors which included KrasAir CEO Boris Abramovich, EBRD, Altima Partners and others, becoming Russia's first low-cost airline. The first flight took off on 29 January 2007 from Moscow to Sochi. Only 20 days after the only other Russian low-cost airline, Avianova, ceased its operations, Sky Express also decided to stop all flights from 29 October 2011. Its fleet and brand name was transferred to Kuban Airlines.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
