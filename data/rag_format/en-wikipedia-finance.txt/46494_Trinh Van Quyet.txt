# Trinh Van Quyet



**Trinh Van Quyet** (born November 27, 1975) is a Vietnamese entrepreneur, who became the second billionaire in Vietnam's stock market on October 27, 2016, with the holding of 22.7 trillion dong ($1.02 billion).

Currently, Quyet is in possession of 108.86 million FLC and 279.5 million ROS shares. At the close on November 11, 2016, with the combined value of ROS and FLC shares, Quyet's holding amounted to over 31 trillion dong ($1.395 billion). Quyet had taken the place of the richest man in Vietnam's stock market, which originally belonged to Pham Nhat Vuong, Vingroup's Chairman for a substantially long time. However, with a surge in price, VIC shares have closed down the gap between Quyet's and Vuong's holdings. According to CafeF, the session will forever go down as the day of the "lightning fight" for the position of the richest man in the stock market.

At the close on November 11, 2016, Quyet's total holdings, which amounted to $1.371 bilion, were only $31.86 million behind Vuong's.

In July 2014, *Forbes Vietnam* published the article "A lawyer doing business" focusing on Quyet who has attracted great attention with a series of major real estate projects. "A right time to invest and a right moment to get "risky" are what led to the successes of FLC Group's Chairman Trinh Van Quyet," states Forbes.

On March 29, 2022, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Security of Vietnam, Lieutenant General To An Xo announced that the Investigative Police Agency of the Ministry of Public Security of Vietnam had issued an arrest warrant for him for allegedly stock market manipulation.
