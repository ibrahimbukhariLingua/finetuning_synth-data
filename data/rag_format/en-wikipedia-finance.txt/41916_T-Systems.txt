## History

T-Systems was founded in 2000, when Deutsche Telekom acquired a 50.1% stake of debis Systemhaus, one of the largest IT services companies in Germany at the time. Most of Deutsche Telekom's existing service and IT businesses were then merged and incorporated under the control of one single company, the newly founded T-Systems. In 2001 T-System's headquarters were moved from Bonn to Frankfurt. In 2002 the remaining 49.9% share of debis Systemhaus was acquired and fully incorporated into T-Systems.

However, the company underwent a leadership crisis during the first years after its creation, due to different agendas of the former debis management and the leadership of the former Telekom subsidiaries.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Since then, T-Systems made a number of acquisitions, most notably the purchase of gedas, the IT subsidiary of Volkswagen Group in December 2005. From 2007 to 2018, Reinhard Clemens was T-Systems' CEO. T-Systems also supported the creation of Silicon Saxony, a major IT cluster in Germany.

In 2008 T-Systems and the Cognizant global IT services provider entered into a global alliance. T-Systems' India operations were taken over by Cognizant following this alliance in late March 2008. T-Systems is also working for the German government and a market leader in Germany.

In 2009, T-Systems came with another wing in India (T-Systems ICT India Pvt. Ltd.) to support its global partners. T-Systems ICT India has its head office in Pune with another 'Point of Production' in Bengaluru established in April 2016 and a 'Cloud and Digital Centre' at Nagpur established in 2022 in partnership with Tech Mahindra. Since January 2022, Anant Padmanabhan is the managing director of T-Systems ICT India.

In 2020, T-Systems employed more than 28,000 people in 20 countries and generated annual sales of EUR 4.2 billion.
