Nicolás Ibáñez Scott


# Nicolás Ibáñez Scott



**Nicolás Cirilo Ibáñez Scott** (born 11 May 1956) is a Chilean economist and businessman commonly known for having been the owner of the supermarket Líder, a shareholder of Papa John’s, and for founding and financing the libertarian think tank Fundación para el Progreso (FPP) and its icon Axel Kaiser. He is also a columnist for newspapers such as *El Mercurio* and *El Líbero*.

Ibáñez's participation in the armed forces has been brought up in Chilean politics. Similarly, he told Revista Caras in 2004 that he has "enormous gratitude" for Augusto Pinochet. As a result, he has been attacked by progressive e-newspapers like *El Desconcierto* (left-wing) or The Clinic (centre-left), who have referred to him as a Pinochetist businessman. Likewise, other centre-left media like *El Mostrador* have criticized him for his defense of the Pinochet dictatorship and his role with the FPP.
