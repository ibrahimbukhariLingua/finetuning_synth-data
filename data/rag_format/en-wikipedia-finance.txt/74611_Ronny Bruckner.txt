**Ronny Bruckner**, also known as **Yaron Bruckner** (31 March 1957 â€“ 4 August 2013), was a Belgian businessman.


## Career

Bruckner started his career aged 20, as director of Zidav, a company specialising in establishing trading partnerships with Romania, Poland and the former Yugoslavia.

In 1981, he founded the company that is now called Eastbridge, and became its CEO. Eastbridge is a private company with more than 40 working subsidiaries in Europe and the United States, employing more than 10,000 people. The company specialises in several areas, including property (the company notably acquired a 25% share in Immobel SA, a property developer listed on Euronext since September 2010), leisure, media, fashion and private educational firms.

In March 2011, Bruckner was appointed a non-executive member of the board of directors of Ageas for a period of three years, until the conclusion of the shareholders' annual general meeting in 2014. Bruckner's name was put forward by Cresida Investments, a shareholder with at least 1% of the capital.

In 1994, with Eastbridge, Bruckner bought out Empik (a national chain of specialised multimedia shops similar to FNAC), which as of May 2009 had 134 shops in Poland and 23 in Ukraine.

From 2003 until his death in 2013, Bruckner, through a series of companies he controlled, built a portfolio of rental residential properties in the Financial District of New York City. His concept was to convert outmoded office buildings into luxury residential rental apartments. His holdings included several notable addresses including 63 Wall Street, 67 Wall Street, 20 Exchange Place, and 70 Pine Street. He utilized a combination of equity and debt provided by US and European Banks. All of his NY debt financing was arranged by The Singer & Bassuk Organization LLC
