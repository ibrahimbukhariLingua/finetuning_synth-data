**Unfair terms in Irish contract law** generally refer to terms in contracts that provide an unreasonable imbalance, usually to the detriment of the consumer, in consumer and other contracts. These unfair terms are provided by common law and more recent statute, most notably Consumer Protection Act 2007 and the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995.


## Consumer Protection Act 2007

The Consumer Protection Act 2007 prohibits numerous unfair practices regarding the formation and implementation of contracts, such as misleading pricing, misleading advertising, aggressive practices and deceptive practices, et al. Most notably, Part 3: Commercial Practices covers:

* Chapter 1: Unfair Commercial Practices
* Chapter 2: Misleading Commercial Practices
* Chapter 3: Aggressive Commercial Practices
* Chapter 4: Prohibited Commercial Practices

## European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations, 1995

The above regulations make general provisions between a seller of goods and a supplier of services in a commercial setting (i.e. not between two individuals) and where the contract was not individually negotiated.

* Flynn & Anor v Breccia [2018] IECA 273
* Sheehan v Breccia & Ors [2018] IECA 286
