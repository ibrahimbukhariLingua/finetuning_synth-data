Nova Scotian dollar


# Nova Scotian dollar



The **dollar** was the currency of Nova Scotia between 1860 and 1871. It replaced the Nova Scotian pound at a rate of 5 dollars = 1 pound (1 dollar = 4 shillings) and was consequently worth less than the Canadian dollar (worth 4s 1.3d). The Nova Scotian dollar was replaced by the Canadian dollar at a rate of 73 Canadian cents = 75 Nova Scotian cents, thus maintaining the difference between the two currencies established in 1860.


## Coins

Between 1861 and 1864, bronze ½ and 1 cent coins were issued. These were the only coins issued for the Nova Scotian dollar. A half-cent coin was required because British six-pence coins in circulation were valued at 12½ Nova Scotian cents.


## Banknotes

Between 1861 and 1866, the Provincial Government introduced Treasury notes for 5 dollars. In addition, three chartered banks issued paper money in Nova Scotia, the *Bank of Nova Scotia*, the *Halifax Banking Company* and the *Merchants Bank of Halifax*. The private banks all issued notes in a single denomination, 20 dollars. They later issued notes in Canadian dollars.

The Province of Canada issued notes dated 1866 overprinted with "Payable in Halifax / only". These were for circulation in Nova Scotia as local currency. Notes for 5 dollars were issued, worth $4.86 in Canadian currency.
