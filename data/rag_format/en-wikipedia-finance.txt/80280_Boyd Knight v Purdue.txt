Boyd Knight v Purdue


# Boyd Knight v Purdue



***Boyd Knight v Purdue*** [1999] 2 NZLR 278 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability for negligent misstatements


## Background

After losing their investment of $750,000 in Burbery Mortgage Finance & Savings Ltd, the plaintiffs sued the auditors to recover their investment, on the basis that without their audit certificate, that under the Securities Act, there would not have been a prospectus, and so no investment in the first place.

In the High Court, they won their claim, albeit reduced by 50% due to contributory negligence due to the fact that it was a speculative investment in the first place.

The auditors appealed.


## Held

The Court of Appeal reversed the High Courts award of damages, on the basis that the plaintiff's had admitted they had not read the advert as a "true and fair view" of the accounts.
