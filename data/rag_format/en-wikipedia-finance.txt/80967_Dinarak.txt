# Dinarak



**Dinarak** (Al-Mutakamilah for Payments Services via Mobile Phone) is a mobile wallet, money transfer, electronic bill payment, funds disbursement service, licensed by the Central Bank of Jordan under the JoMoPay national switch and launched in late 2015 as Dinarak wallet as part of the Jordanian central bank's efforts to advocate financial inclusion for the un-banked segment of the Jordanian population. Dinarak allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money and pay for goods and services via their mobile phone. The service can be accessed by Dinarak mobile application.

JoMoPay, the Jordanian national mobile payments switch, is a unique payment system that has created cross-platform and platform level interoperability for multiple digital payments instruments in Jordan. This includes interoperability between the licensed mobile payment services providers as well as interoperability between mobile wallets, bank accounts, and prepaid cards.
