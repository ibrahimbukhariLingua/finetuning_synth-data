Midas List


# Midas List



The ***Forbes* Midas list** is the annual ranking by *Forbes* magazine of the most influential and best-performing venture capital investors. Described by Kara Swisher as the "Oscars for venture capitalists in tech," the Midas List uses parameters that include the first-day market capitalization of IPOs and the opinions of a panel of experts.

The name alludes to the mythological King Midas, renowned for his ability to turn anything he touched into gold. *Forbes* partnered with venture capital fund TrueBridge Capital Partners to create the list from 2011 to 2016.
