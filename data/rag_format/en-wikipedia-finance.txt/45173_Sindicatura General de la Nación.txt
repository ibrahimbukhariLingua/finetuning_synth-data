Sindicatura General de la Nación


# Sindicatura General de la Nación



The **General Office of the Comptroller** (Spanish: *Sindicatura General de la Nación*, mostly known for its acronym **SIGEN**) is the Argentine institution that undertakes the internal control of the Argentine economy. The agency is part of the executive branch of Argentina, and was established in 1992 by Law No. 24,156. Since 2009 it has been presided over by Daniel Gustavo Reposo.


## Overview

The job of SIGEN is to be an internal auditor of the National Executive Branch. It is an advisory function to the highest Government authority and depends directly on it.

Its function is different from the General Audit of the Nation (*Auditoría General de la Nación*, AGN) so this is a parliamentary body whose leadership is shared with the opposition parties, in accordance with their representation in the National Congress, and carries out control external, also being able to control, where appropriate, the highest national authorities.

SIGEN coordinates internal control systems at the national level, which includes compliance with accounting standards, emanating from the General Accounting Office of the Nation (CGN), legal and operational aspects. That is why we talk about a systemic and comprehensive approach.
For this reason, among its various functions are those of dictating and applying internal control standards, which must be respected by the Internal Audit Units (UAI) that operate in each Ministry and independent body of the National Public Administration.

It was created in 1992 from Law 24,156.

The SIGEN is an entity directly dependent on the President of Argentina and a autonomous body, as established in article 97 of law 24,156. The General Trustee who is responsible for the entity has the rank of Secretary of the Presidency of the Nation (article 108). He is assisted by three Deputy General Trustees.
