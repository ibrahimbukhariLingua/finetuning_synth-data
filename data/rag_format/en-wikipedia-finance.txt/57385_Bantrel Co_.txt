## History


### Oil Sands

Bantrel's parent company, Bechtel Corporation, was involved in oil sands development early. Bechtel designed and constructed the Great Canadian Oil Sands upgrader in 1962, which is now Suncor Energy. Bechtel also developed Syncrude's upgrading facilities.

Bechtel transferred the oil sands portfolio to Bantrel in 1983.
