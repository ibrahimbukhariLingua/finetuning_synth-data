## History

The University started out as a food sciences-specialised college, affiliated to China's Central Ministry of Grain, whose academic development has extensively learned from the development histories of institutions such as the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Wageningen University, and Universidade Estadual de Campinas. It was once renamed Nanjing Institute of Food Sciences and Economics (南京粮食经济学院), dedicated to training technocrats in food science, economics, and engineering. On 6 May 1993, the University was then reorganised as the Nanjing University of Economics (or the Nanjing School of Economics, Chinese: 南京经济学院). Since 2003, the University has become the current Nanjing University of Finance and Economics.
