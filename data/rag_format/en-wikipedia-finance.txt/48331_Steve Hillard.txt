# Steve Hillard



**Steve Hillard** is an American private equity entrepreneur, attorney, author, and television producer.


## Biography

In 1997, Hillard founded Council Tree Communications, a private equity fund, that assisted the first significant Native American investment in a television network and investments in telecommunications providers

In 2011, Hillard's first book, *Mirkwood: A Novel About JRR Tolkien*, was involved in an intellectual property controversy. The dispute was settled in May 2011. The settlement terms included the disclaimer, "This is a work of fiction which is neither endorsed nor connected with The JRR Tolkien Estate or its publisher." The work of Tolkien fan fiction has, according to the scholar Una McCormack, garnered more than its share of attention, while large numbers of "excellent" works of fan fiction by women are overlooked.
