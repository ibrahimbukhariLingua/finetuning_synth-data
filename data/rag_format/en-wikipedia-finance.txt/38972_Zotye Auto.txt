# Zotye Auto



**Zotye Auto** (Chinese: 众泰汽车; pinyin: *Zhòngtài Qìchē*; officially **Zotye International Automobile Trading Co., Ltd.**) is a privately owned Chinese automobile manufacturer based in Yongkang, Zhejiang, China. It is owned by Zotye Holding Group and was established in 2005.


## History

Zotye was founded on 2005 by Zotye Holding Group. Previously, Zotye had contracts to only export automotive parts but increased its production to complete cars to take advantage of the expanding Chinese automotive market. In 2005, because of their reputation as a reliable partner, Zotye established contracts for sales subsidiaries in 10 different countries.
Since 2005, Zotye has expanded its automobile lineup and production numbers. The first model of the brand was a small SUV, the Zotye RX6400, later renamed to Zotye Nomad. The Zotye Nomad bears a remarkable resemblance to the Daihatsu Terios (see also Automotive industry in China).

Zotye's total revenues in 2006 were 2.88 billion RMB (about €290 million). Zotye Auto ranked 352nd with a revenue of 20.80 billion RMB and a profit of 1.13 billion RMB on Top 500 Chinese Companies List released by Fortune China on July 10, 2018.

The company entered bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings in 2021. Its cessation followed complex financial issues caused by consequently worsening debt. Production was reportedly restarted in December 2022.

In March 2023, the company's domicile was changed from the Economic Development Zone, She County, Huangshan City, Anhui Province to No. 1 Beihu Road, Economic Development Zone, Yongkang City, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province. In July 2024 Zotye announced agreements to expand markets in Russia and Algeria.
