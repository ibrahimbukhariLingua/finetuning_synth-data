## History

Minor International was founded in 1978 as Royal Garden Resort Co., Ltd. with an initial capital of three million baht. The company was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) on 14 August 1988 (1988-08-14). In late 2004, the company completed the acquisition of 100 percent of The Minor Food Group PCL, and followed this in January 2005 with its de-listing from the SET.

In 2006, Anantara entered Dubai at The Palm Jumeirah. In 2008, William Heinecke acquired 70 percent of Thai Express, 50 percent of The Coffee Club, and 50 percent of Elewana Afrika for US$12 million. That same year, he opened the Desert Islands Resort & Spa by Anantara on Sir Bani Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.

On June 12, 2009, the company completed a business restructuring plan with Minor Corporation (MINOR). As a result, the company has, directly and indirectly, owned 99.92 percent of MINOR's equity interest. On 22 June 2009, MINOR was delisted from SET.

In July 2011, Minor International completed a compulsory acquisition and purchased most of the shares of Oaks Hotels, Resorts & Suites, expanding its presence in Australia, New Zealand, and Dubai with a portfolio of 36 serviced suites.
