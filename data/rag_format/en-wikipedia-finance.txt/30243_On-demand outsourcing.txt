On-demand outsourcing


# On-demand outsourcing



**On-demand outsourcing** is a trend in outsourcing wherein major internal operations processes of a company are being shifted to a provider that is paid for by the number of transactions involved. The business transferring the services pays for the quality, special skills and the competence of the service provider's employees. There has been an expansion of the outsourcing concept to include on-demand outsourcing. This refers to the process undertaken by business managers to adopt an outsourcing policy that ensures that the specific business and supplies including technical manpower are accessed as the need arises. It focuses a business strategy to improve its goods and services and to drive a business towards quality improvement.


## Background

The reasons for general outsourcing can be summarized in following factors: the rising wages of the domestic worker, or companies wish to gain access to the exceptional capability. The risk of outsourcing service is normally assumed by the outsourcing service provider, not by the companies themselves. Nowadays, outsourcing on demand is preferred by many because of its ability to reap diverse sources of material and labour supply. Under this strategy, the driving motivation is the desire for business diversification and quality.

This type of outsourcing becomes more popular as service providers may not be able to outsource their employees on a daily basis owing to high demand and workload. Therefore, the service provider has to consider the order of resource allocation into different departments, according to the needed level and price offset by the companies. It is common that the companies will always outsource for their core business.


## Essence of strategic on-demand outsourcing

The most important difference between this type of outsourcing and general outsourcing is the critical transfer of ownership of the organisation from to a service provider. In an ideal on-demand outsourcing, there is an important passage of factors of production from the owner to the service provider. It encourages a system where business exists in a simple but comprehensive relationship. In some cases, the employees and entire human resources is transferred to the service provider.
Notably, in order to undertake a strategic outsourcing, there are conditions that have to be met. Firstly, it should include the creation of a competitive advantage; this is an important element that should form the basis of adopting this type of outsourcing.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Secondly, on-demand outsourcing demands that the managers spend more time in streamlining the activities that are important for business success. In addition, they need to undertake repositioning of the business in the marketplace or achieve a dramatic increase in market share. When these elements and motivating factors are met, it will make the outsourcing strategy a competitive edge.


## Application in IT and financial sectors

Leading economists ʷʰᵒ? suggest that on-demand outsourcing use will drive business from local to international platforms. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of each sourcing strategy, a business can gain a competitive edge over the others.


### HSBC

For instance, HSBC Holdings has succeeded in acquiring other companies and integrating their customers. Originally, HSBC made the decision on outsourcing mainly because the bank started to find it difficult to update its technology and services at the same pace with the rapidly changing financial and digital world. Besides their core financial business, they also started to consider improvements on their banking services part, where their reputation could be maintained and developed.

"Moreover, we wanted to be able to turn the tap on and off whenever we wanted," says Rumi Contractor, HSBC's chief information officer for Europe, who helped build the company's outsourcing center. This indicates that HSBC also seeks to put more people to work according to their different talents and skills, as the larger workforce could increase the working efficiency.

Nowadays, HSBC has over 9,500 offices in 80 countries worldwide, a huge increase from the original size of 30 people working on HSBC software maintenance in India in 2002. The "back office" mainly provides call centre and bank process services for HSBC.


### IBM

IBM entered into a $5 billion manufacturing outsourcing arrangement with the Sanmina-SCI Corporation in 1992. During this outsourcing process, the expanded operations of Sammina-SCI passed the $1 billion mark. This case was the only one of the successes that IBM and their outsourcing services providers achieved from the information technology outsourcing in the early 1990s. IBM has also signed a ten-year outsourcing service plan with Bharti Airtel Ltd in Bangalore, India. In 2013, IBM prepared to renew this IT contract in India to compete with intense multinational and local Indian rivals that they had never faced before. The BPO outsourcing contract for managing software application and computer networks for Airtel is now estimated to be worth over $2.5 billion.

The two present good examples of on-demand outsourcing. Both business organizations benefited by acquiring the necessary equipment and labour from the partner company.

### Limitations

However, the expansion of outsourcing services brought up the issue of the loss of employees in the host country. For instance, the New York Post reported that IBM employed more workers in their outsourced service provider places, such as India, than in the U.S.
Also, outsourcing may be making a big comeback, as word leaked that IBM would cut about 5,000 jobs in the U.S. and move the work to India. This may be the beginning of a new wave of exporting of American jobs to developing countries, which have large pools of well-educated workers.


## Countries involved in on-demand outsourcing


### India

India is said to be the dominant country in providing outsourcing services in Asia, as India offers more integrated services across the offshoring spectrum, while countries such as China and Malaysia have limitations in the form of their smaller labour pools and lower-end technology in their outsourcing services.

IBM's architects department started their outsourcing contract with the fast-growing mobile telecom firm Bharti Airtel—Jai Menon, Bharti's former CIO, both IBM and the mobile telecom firm gained great benefits from this ten-year deal. India has become one of IBM's biggest platforms, and this resulted in the fact that IBM has more employees in India than in its U.S headquarters.

The annual revenue in India was growing at two-digit rate from 2005, 55% in 2005, 37% in 2006, and stayed over 30% in 2007. Apart from ITO outsourcing to India, the biggest UK flag carrier airline, British Airways, began their business process outsourcing in India in 1996. Outsourcing services started to include the British Airways customer services, also known as the World Network Services. There have been some predictions that there will be a recession in the Indian on-demand outsourcing industry in the early years.

As a result, India has not yet developed its own technology.


#### Future challenges in India

It seems that India has overcome these difficulties. However, there will still emerge new challenges that India will have to face in such a rapid-growing, competitive environment, such as they should consider recruiting the workforce based on quality and not quantity.

## Failures

Dell, a privately owned multinational company based in the United States, is one of the largest technological corporations in the world, employing more than 103,300 people worldwide. However, the call center operation for the OptiPlex desktops and Latitude laptops was moved back to the United States. Dell moved its customer services and technical support centre to Bangalore in India in 2001, and set their second site in Hyderabad in 2003. However, the company found that the brand started to lose its reputation when the language and culture barrier between the customers and the employees hindered communication, especially when the employee in the Bangalore centre had professional skills but weren't experienced enough to service customers. The lack of training time on outsourcing and resolving these cultural barriers could have contributed to the strategy's lack of success. The outcome was that even though Dell's market continued to grow, customer satisfaction declined. One of the positive outcomes was that Dell started to understand the importance of outsourcing based on the average need and cost.

Forbes also concluded that some factors that may lead to failure for companies using outsourcing services, such as desire for in-house expertise and marketplace pressures.
