List of regions of the United Kingdom by GRDP


# List of regions of the United Kingdom by GRDP



This article lists the **gross regional domestic product (GRDP) of regions of the United Kingdom**, defined as Level 2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2), in nominal values. Values are shown in euros in the original source. For comparison, all figures are converted into pounds sterling and US dollars according to annual average exchange rates. All values are given in millions, and converted values are rounded to the nearest whole number.

Note that 2021 was an exceptional year because of the fall in GDP in 2020 which averaged 11.0% across the country. The recovery in 2021 was therefore a partial "bounce back" from this slump.
