## Philanthropy

The Eram group engages in several social entrepreneurship and philanthropy activities in various sectors such as education, health, sanitation and youth empowerment. A few years ago when the lack of public sanitation affected women and children largely in India, it led Ahmed to focus on and bring about a change in the situation of sanitation. Ahmed set up the Eram Scientific Solutions (ESS), a social enterprise focusing on research and development in Khobar, Saudi Arabia. In 2008, ESS developed eToilets that have been set up in India. ESS was the recipient of a grant of more than 400,000 USD from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for research into toilet hygiene, water and energy related issues. The ingenious 'e-toilet' (an automated public sanitation solution in line with Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan) was illustrated in the UN Innovation exhibition. These unmanned toilets with automated access control were provided on a commercial basis since 2010. The initiative later spread to middle east and north African countries. Dr. Ahmed has also collaborated with the United Nations Information Centre, India, for propagating Sustainable Development Goals. To encourage more young people to pursue a healthy and active lifestyle, he instituted the UN@70 Cup, an All Kerala Inter-School football tournament, thus named to commemorate 70 years of the United Nations existence.

Dr. Ahmed has been supporting individuals in Kerala by donating towards heart transplantations. He also runs a skill-training institute ESPOiR Academy that functions under the Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence (KASE).
