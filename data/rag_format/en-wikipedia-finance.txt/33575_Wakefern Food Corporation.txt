The name "Wakefern" is a portmanteau of the founders' names: **W** for Lawrence Weiss, **A** for Sam and Alex Aidekman, **K** for Abe Kesselman, **E** for Leo Eisenberg, and **FERN** for Dave Fern, although the company adopted the name ShopRite for its stores in 1951.


### Cooperative overview

Wakefern owns one of the Northeast's largest trucking fleets and is the fourth-largest cooperative in the United States. In fiscal year 2016, its revenue was $16 billion, and $16.3 billion in 2017. In 2011, *Supermarket News* gave Wakefern its Retailer Excellence Award and both *The Griffin Report* and *Progressive Grocer* named Wakefern its Retailer of the Year. In 2012, the company was named one of the Best Places to Work in New Jersey by *NJBIZ Magazine*. As of 2011, Wakefern was ranked 17th by sales among all supermarket operators in the United States.

Wakefern also created and operates or franchises the Price Rite limited-assortment chain (based in Wethersfield, Connecticut) of stores in Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Virginia. Dearborn Market is a supermarket in New Jersey.

On August 1, 2013, Wakefern added The Fresh Grocer banner, an eight-store chain based in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, when Burns Supermarkets joined the cooperative. One of the stores was converted to the ShopRite name while the others retained the Fresh Grocer name. The banner has since been adopted by stores operated by other members of the cooperative.

Wakefern supplies all of its members' ShopRite stores as well as the Price Rite and Fresh Grocer chains, and Dearborn Market. In July 2007, the cooperative announced that for the first time it was offering its wholesale services to third-party supermarket operators, in the Northeastern United States and other areas of the country.
