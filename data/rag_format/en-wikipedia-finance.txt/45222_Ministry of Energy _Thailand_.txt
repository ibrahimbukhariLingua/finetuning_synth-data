## Thailand Power Development Plan 2015-2036 (PDP2025)

Thailand's Power Development Plan (PDP). is the nation's roadmap for electric power generation, distribution, and consumption. The plan, prepared by the Ministry of Energy (MOE) and EGAT, is issued iteratively. The previous edition, PDP2010 Revision 3, covered the years 2012-2030.

Along with the PDP, the MOE produces several subsidiary plans that roll up into the PDP:¹–¹

* Thailand's average GDP growth over the period 2014-2036 will be 3.94 percent annually
* Thailand's population growth over the same period will average 0.03 percent annually
* Energy savings over the period as forecasted in the EEDP will total 89,672 GWh
* Renewables, including domestic hydro, will supply 19,634.4 MW of power over the period
* Thailand's new power demands will grow 2.67 percent annually, 2014-2036
* In 2036 Thailand's peak electricity demand will be 49,655 MW and that total electricity demand will be 326,119 GWh

PDP2015 projects the following changes in Thailand electrical power generation fuel mix over the period 2014-2036:²–¹

* Imported hydro-power: Rising from 7 percent in 2014 to 15-20 percent in 2036
