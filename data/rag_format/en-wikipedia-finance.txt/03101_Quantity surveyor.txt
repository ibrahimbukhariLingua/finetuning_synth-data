Quantity surveyor


# Quantity surveyor



In the construction industry, a **quantity surveyor** (**QS**) is a professional with expert knowledge of construction costs and contracting. Qualified professional quantity surveyors can be known as Chartered Surveyors (Members and Fellows of RICS) in the UK and Certified Quantity Surveyors (a designation of the Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors) in Australia and other countries. In some countries, including Canada, South Africa, Kenya and Mauritius, qualified quantity surveyors are known as Professional Quantity Surveyors, a title protected by law.
Due to a shift in the construction industry and the increased demand for Quantity Surveying expertise, today less importance is being placed on Charterships, with a large % of working Quantity Surveyors practising with College / University degrees and without membership or fellowship to professional associations.

Quantity surveyors are responsible for managing all aspects of the contractual and financial side of construction projects. They help to ensure that the construction project is completed within its projected budget. Quantity surveyors are also hired by contractors to help with the valuation of construction work for the contractor, help with bidding and project budgeting, and the submission of bills to the client.


## Duties

The duties of a quantity surveyor are as follows:

* Conducting financial feasibility studies for development projects.
* Cost estimate, cost planning and cost management.
* Analyzing terms and conditions in the contract.
* Predicting potential risks in the project and taking precautions to mitigate such.
* Forecasting the costs of different materials needed for the project.
* Prepare tender documents, contracts, budgets and other documentation.
* Take note of changes made and adjusting the budget accordingly.
* Tender management including preparation of bills of quantities, contract conditions and assembly of tender documents

## Qualification

A university degree or diploma alone does not allow one to register as a Chartered Quantity Surveyor. Usually, anyone looking to qualify as a Chartered Quantity Surveyor, Certified Quantity Surveyor must hold appropriate educational qualifications and work experience, and must pass a professional competence assessment.

The RICS requires an RICS approved degree, several years of practical experience, and passing the Assessment of Professional Competence (APC) to qualify as a Chartered Quantity Surveyor. Some candidates may be entitled to qualify through extensive experience and reciprocity agreements.


## Future of quantity surveying

As construction projects become increasingly complex, the demand for skilled quantity surveyors continues to grow. The importance of Quantity Surveyors becoming Chartered is lessening year on year, with more and more businesses opting to hire staff with a standard Quantity Surveying degree and develop Quantity Surveying skills through their own training programmes. The future of quantity surveying lies in embracing digitalization, automation, and sustainable practices. Quantity surveyors will play a pivotal role in managing costs, optimizing resources, and ensuring the financial success of construction projects.
