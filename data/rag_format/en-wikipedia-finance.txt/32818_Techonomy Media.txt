Techonomy Media


# Techonomy Media



**Techonomy Media Inc.** is an American conference and media company founded in 2011 and headquartered in New York. Techonomy organizes the annual invitation-only thought leadership Techonomy conference.


## Background

Techonomy's name combines "technology" and "economy" to suggest that technology is entwined with society. The company's events and media generally argue that tech, if applied productively, can result in tremendous social progress. The company's programs discuss how businesses in almost every industry are faced with the choice of adapting to take advantage of technology or being rendered extinct as the pace of change quickens.

The first Techonomy conference, in 2010, was organized by a partnership that included Kirkpatrick along with former Fortune editors Peter Petre and Brent Schlender, as well as Michael Christman and Carrie Van Heyst. Techonomy Media was created in early 2011 to continue the annual conference and develop editorial content, including video journalism. Simone Ross, former program director for Fortune's conference division, served as program director for the initial Techonomy conference in 2010, and co-founded Techonomy Media as COO and Chief Program Officer for the company. Michael Federle also was a co-founder of the company. Forbes Media, which includes Forbes and Forbes.com, became a minority investor in the company in July 2011.
