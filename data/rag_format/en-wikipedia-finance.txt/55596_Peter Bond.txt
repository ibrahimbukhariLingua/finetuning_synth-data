# Peter Bond



**Peter Bond** is an Australian mining and energy executive, best known as the former Executive Chairman of Linc Energy and creator of the world's first synthetic crude oil. He is now a director of renewable energy company Infinite Power and ranked among the most influential business executives in Australia in *Who's Who Business*.


## Early life

Bond was raised in Camden, New South Wales. His father was a truck driver and his mother was a teacher. He finished high school in 1981 and became a metallurgist with BHP.


## Career

After leaving BHP, Bond began buying quarries, and soon started making $17,000 a month trucking coal. He became a millionaire by age 26. Bond debuted on the Australian *BRW* rich list in 2008 with a net worth of $352,000,000, made it to number 21 on the *Sunday Mail* Queensland Top 150 Rich List and peaked as the 10th richest business person in Australia, with a net worth of $572,000,000.

As a metallurgist, Bond always had an interest in mining technology and renewable energy, and in 2005 he took over Linc Energy, signing a memorandum with Syntroleum granting a licence to use the company's proprietary gas-to-liquid technology. This technology was used to build a GTL pilot plant in November 2007 at Linc's Chinchilla facility. The plant was commissioned in August 2008. The first synthetic crude oil was produced in October 2008.

In 2012, in a world-first, Bond flew 4,000 km across Australia in a jet powered by the fuel produced at Linc Energy's gas to liquid plant in Chinchilla. The company a signed memorandum of agreement with BP for its jet fuel and was heralding the ability to produce 250,000 litres of jet fuel a year.

The following year Bond signed a deal with Russian Billionaire Roman Abramovich to explore gas to liquid opportunities in Russia, after the two met in a Brisbane restaurant – a meeting which was even covered by major international news outlets, including Fox News.

After Linc Energy entered voluntary administration in 2016, following a court case which was later dropped, Bond put his energy into the restoration of Dunk Island, before starting renewable energy business, Infinite Power.


## Personal life

Bond has six children with his ex-wife Louise. He has no relation to Australian business person Alan Bond.


## Television

Bond appeared on the Australian version of *The Secret Millionaire*, a television program in which prominent millionaires go undercover in impoverished communities and give away substantial sums of money to help those in need. Bond’s appearance and $300,000 donation were widely praised as being among the most generous of the series.
His experience on The Secret Millionaire led him to strike up a friendship with Russell Crowe and launch a television production company called Rough Diamond. Rough Diamond also included a community foundation which received part of the company's profits.
Rough Diamond, under Bond's guidance, was best known for producing the documentary series 'Where it all Began' – a series of "Real life, true stories of "the Aussie battlers" who against all odds came out on top".
