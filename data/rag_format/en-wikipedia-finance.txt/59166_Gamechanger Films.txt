Gamechanger Films


# Gamechanger Films



**Gamechanger Films** is an American company that finances independent films directed by women.


## History

Gamechanger Films was founded in 2013 by Julie Parker Benello, Dan Cogan, Geralyn Dreyfous, Wendy Ettinger. Mynette Louie was the President, Derek Nguyen was the Director of Operations & Creative Affairs, and Mary Jane Skalski is the senior adviser. Louie and Nguyen departed to start their own company, The Population, in 2019. Brenda Robinson is a new partner in Gamechanger Films 2.0, which is led by Effie T. Brown.

Films funded must be directed or co-directed by a woman, but they may be of any genre. Films do not need to be focused on females or female-centric topics. They support films of a budget of $2 million or less. Funding was raised by Chicken & Egg Pictures and Impact Partners and comes from equity investors. Gamechanger Films is for-profit. Louie said that their goal "is to finance films that are critically and commercially viable". As a result of this, they do not fund experimental non-narrative films. In 2014, they established a $2500 grant for female directors who screen their films at South by Southwest.
