Deutsche EuroShop AG has been listed on the German stock exchange since 2 January 2001, and the entire proceeds from the issue went to Deutsche Grundbesitz Management GmbH (later name change to DB Real Estate), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. The chairmen of the board were Knut Neuss and Jürgen Wundrack, and the chairman of the supervisory board was Helmut Ullrich. On 15 April 2003 the company was included in the Prime Standard, and on 14 July 2003 in the SDAX. It was included in the EPRA index on 2 January 2004 and, from 20 September 2004, in the MDAX, which it had to leave on 23 September 2019. It was subsequently listed on the SDAX again.

Further capital increases followed on 7 July 2009 and on 1 February and 23 November 2010, which brought the company a total of 322 million euros. In November 2012, Deutsche EuroShop AG generated proceeds of around EUR 167.7 million from the placement of a convertible bond and shares from a capital increase. The convertible bond was finally converted to 99.5% in November 2017, the total number of shares was 61,783,594.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Deutsche EuroShop suffered loss of rent of 24.2% in the first half of 2020. The valuation of real estate assets was also devalued by an average of 5.5%.

As a result of the successful takeover by Oaktree Capital Management and CURA Vermögensverwaltung, the family office of the Otto family, Deutsche EuroShop AG had to leave the SDAX on 19 September 2022. The Executive Board team consisting of Wilhelm Wellner († 2022) and Olaf Borkers left the company by mutual agreement following the successful takeover bid.

After the COVID-19 pandemic subsided, Deutsche EuroShop experienced a resurgence with rising customer numbers and tenant turnover. At the beginning of 2023, shares in six shopping centres were acquired and a capital increase of around EUR 315 million was implemented. Furthermore, the company increased investments in its shopping centers.
