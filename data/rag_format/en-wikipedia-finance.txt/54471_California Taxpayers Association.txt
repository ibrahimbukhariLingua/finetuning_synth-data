California Taxpayers Association


# California Taxpayers Association



The **California Taxpayers Association** is an advocacy organization in the U.S. state of California founded in 1926 to promote lower taxes in the state. The association, also known simply as CalTax, serves its members through research and advocacy on significant tax and spending issues in the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. CalTax is led by President Teresa Casazza, a certified public accountant with many years of experience working on tax policy.


## Advocacy team

When working on tax policy problems before the Legislature, tax agencies, local governments, in court, or on statewide ballots, CalTax staff members closely monitor legislative, tax agency, and local government tax policy deliberations and coordinate with CalTax members to oppose tax policy changes that would increase taxes. CalTax also supports budget reform to end the state government's boom-and-bust system of budgeting.
