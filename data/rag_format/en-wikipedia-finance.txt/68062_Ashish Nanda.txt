## IIMA Activities

Nanda's vision for IIMA is "to educate leaders of enterprises." His strategic thrust at the Institute has been to (a) **connect** proactively with five constituencies (research, practice, policy, alumni, and connectivity), (b) **nurture** a high performance culture at the Institute (by fostering autonomy, stretch, and community; and) (c) **grow** the Institute in strategic areas (including expansion of Executive Education and PGPx programs, starting a School of Public Policy at the Institute, and recruiting faculty at entry level and lateral positions).

Nanda led significant fund raising efforts at IIMA. He was actively involved in discussions leading to drafting of the IIM Bill, which affords IIMs strategic and operational autonomy. He has recommended that management education capacity should be expanded in India not only by opening new institutions, but also by growing existing ones.

Nanda has led an initiative for greater diversity in admissions to IIMA, leading to an increase in the proportion of women students and students with non-engineering backgrounds in IIMA.
