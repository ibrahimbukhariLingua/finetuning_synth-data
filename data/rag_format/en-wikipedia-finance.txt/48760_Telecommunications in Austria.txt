### Fixed broadband

Austria's fixed broadband connectivity demonstrates both advancement and areas needing enhancement, according to the DESI 2022 report. The country achieves a fixed broadband take-up rate of 78% among households, aligning with the EU average. However, Austria falls short in adopting high-speed broadband (at least 100 Mbps), with an 18% take-up rate, significantly lower than the EU average of 41%. Coverage of Very High Capacity Networks (VHCN) and Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) in Austria, at 45% and 27% respectively, also trails behind the EU averages of 70% and 50%.


### Mobile broadband

The country has demonstrated substantial advancements in mobile broadband connectivity, achieving a 91% take-up rate among individuals, which exceeds the EU average of 87%. Notably, the country has made progress in 5G deployment, providing coverage to 77% of populated areas, surpassing the EU average by 11 percentage points and aligning with its objective of achieving nationwide 5G coverage by 2025. Additionally, Austria has allocated 66% of the total harmonized 5G spectrum as of 2022, surpassing the EU average of 56%.


### Digital public services

In the DESI 2022 report, Austria ranked 12th among EU countries in terms of digital public services, aligning closely with EU averages in the provision of digital public services for citizens and businesses, with take-up rates of 76 out of 100 and 81 out of 100, respectively. The country exhibited strong engagement in e-government services, with a usage rate of 79% among its internet users, surpassing the EU average of 65%. Additionally, Austria demonstrated proficiency in providing pre-filled forms and open data, scoring 71 out of 100 and 92%, respectively. These scores exceed the EU averages of 64 out of 100 for pre-filled forms and 81% for open data.

Under the 'Digital Action Plan Austria', the country has implemented strategic initiatives to improve digital interactions between the government and citizens. One such initiative is the 'Business Service Portal', developed to simplify public service procedures, which has been recently updated to enhance user experience and integrate AI for improved service delivery. The rollout of 'ID Austria' represents an important step towards establishing a unified electronic identification system, aimed at succeeding the 'Mobile Phone Signature' system and ensuring compatibility with the EU-wide e-IDAS regulation for cross-border authentication. Projects like the 'Digital Office App' and the ELGA electronic health record system are part of efforts to make digital public services more accessible in Austria.


### Internet censorship and surveillance

In August 2014, IFPI Austria has requested Internet blocking for several file sharing web sites such as The Pirate Bay and isoHunt, starting the latest August 14, 2014 (postponed from August 1, 2014). This procedure has been heavily criticized in the media, as there is no formal procedure for unblocking such IPs ever again, and no formal review process that incorrect blocks cannot be obtained. Users sharing an IP may be blocked as a side effect, too.

As of May 2016ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Austrian ISPs are now once again free to unblock all previously blocked sites after the government appealed a new law for file sharing similar to the one in Switzerland. Although the IFPI is still trying to challenge this ruling.

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. Individuals and groups engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. Authorities work to restrict access to Web sites containing information that violates the law, such as neo-Nazi and child pornography sites. Authorities restrict access to banned Web sites by trying to shut such sites and forbidding the country's Internet service providers to carry them.

The Austrian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press. The independent media are active and express a wide variety of views with few restrictions. Individuals generally criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.

The law prohibits incitement, insult, or contempt against a group because of its members’ race, nationality, or ethnicity if the statement violates human dignity and the government strictly enforces these laws. The law prohibits public denial, belittlement, approval, or justification of the Nazi genocide or other Nazi crimes against humanity in a print publication, a broadcast, or other media and the government strictly enforces these laws. Strict libel and slander laws discourage reporting of governmental abuse. For example, many observers believed that the ability and willingness of the police to sue for libel or slander discourages individuals from reporting abuse by police.

On 31 July 2012, a 26-year-old man received an 18-month sentence, of which 12 months were to be served, for posting that his favorite book was Hitler’s *Mein Kampf* and linking to Nazi material on his Facebook page.

In February 2007 Austrian authorities were able to uncover a "child-pornography ring" involving seventy-seven countries, based on a report by a man working for a Vienna-based Internet file-hosting service.

As of March 2022 the websites of RT have been blocked by the major Internet service providers.

In August 2022, ISPs were ordered to block further domains, as well as individual IP addresses belonging to CDN providers. The latter rendered a large number of websites to become unavailable.


## Telephones

### Mobile phones

* 7.6 million mobile phone lines in use, 60th in the world (2011).

The Austrian mobile phone market is highly competitive, with some of the lowest rates in Europe. Due to the geographical structures of Austria (mountains, flat lands, lakes) many providers use it as a "testing range" for new services. Mobile number portability was introduced in 2008, allowing users to retain their mobile phone numbers when switching between network operators. The original area codes allocated to each operator can no longer be used to determine the network with which a subscriber is registered.

D-Netz by Telekom Austria. This network was switched off at the end of the 1990s.

There are three nationwide GSM networks which also support additional brands and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs).
