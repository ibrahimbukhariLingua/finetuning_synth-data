## History

**Addleshaw Goddard** traces its roots back to the very first public record of solicitors in the UK – the Law List – published in 1775.


### Addleshaw Booth & Co

In 1775, Nicholas Smith founds a firm in Leeds, and Samuel Lister Booth is admitted as a solicitor in 1823. The successors of these practices combined over the years to become Booth, Clough & Booth in 1869. Further amalgamations lead to the firm becoming Booth & Co. In c.1936. John William Addleshaw begins legal practice in 1857 in Manchester and enters partnership with William Warburton in 1873. The firm becomes Addleshaw & Sons in 1904, and then Addleshaw Sons & Latham in 1917. In 1997, Addleshaw Sons & Latham merges with Booth & Co to become the national firm **Addleshaw Booth & Co**.


### Theodore Goddard

In 1902, John Theodore Goddard founds blue chip, City of London firm, **Theodore Goddard**, which grows through amalgamation with other city practices, such as Rhys Roberts & Co (founded in 1883 by future Prime Minister **David Lloyd George**). The firm developed as a balanced general practice, with an emphasis on high-profile private client work. Goddard was appointed by Wallis Simpson as an adviser to her during divorce proceedings and in relation to her involvement during the United Kingdom abdication Crisis of 1936. Theodore Goddard retained a strong media and entertainment law practice with clients such as *The Rolling Stones*, David Bowie, Michael Jackson and others; and high-profile cases involving celebrities such as the *Hello! magazine* dispute over photographs of Catherine Zeta-Jones's wedding to Michael Douglas.
