## Career

In 1995, Latour was hired as a news assistant in the Washington, D.C. bureau of *The Wall Street Journal*. He later was assigned to the newspaper's London bureau and then to the newspaper's New York City headquarters, where he joined, and later led *The Wall Street Journal*'s technology team.

### Dow Jones CEO

On May 4, 2020, Dow Jones announced Latour would replace William Lewis as CEO. He assumed the role on May 15, 2020.

On July 21, 2020, more than 280 *Journal* journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to Latour criticizing the opinion pages' "lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence," adding, "opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by WSJ reporting." The letter cited a June 2020 opinion article by the U.S. vice president Mike Pence that contained errors, asserting that "scrutinizing these numbers would have required no more than a Google search."

Latour is reported to have a strained relationship with Matt Murray, editor in chief of *The Wall Street Journal*, a Dow Jones publication.
