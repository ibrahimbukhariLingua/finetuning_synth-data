## History

In 1878, Werner von Siemens built a telephone with a horseshoe magnet, which amplified, and improved voice signal quality. In 1913, Siemens introduced the first industrially-produced hearing instrument, the Esha-Phonophor.

During the 1950s, Christian Tøpholm and Erik Westermann formed Widex and began developing hearing devices in Tøpholm's converted cellar. In 1956, the company produced its first model, the Widex 561. In 1959 Siemens developed the Auriculette, a behind-the-ear (BTE) device with small lightweight components that fit together in a single unit. In 1966, they developed their first device worn entirely in-the-ear (ITE), the Siretta 339.

In 1988, Widex produced the first digitally-programmable hearing aid with a remote control, the Quattro Q8. In 1995, Widex created Senso, the first fully digital unit that fits completely in the ear. In 2004, the company created the world's first hearing aid in which right and left devices were synchronized and in 2008, the world's smallest receiver-in-canal hearing aid.

In 2015, Swedish private equity firm EQT bought Siemens Audiology Solutions for more than 2 billion euros and renamed the company Sivantos.

Sivantos Group joined the UN Global Compact Initiative in 2017 and began to streamline its social activities and CSR policy. The company's first Communication on Progress, the annual report to the office of the UN Secretary General, was published on 24 May 2018.

In 2018, Widex and Sivantos announced an $8B merger, creating the 3rd largest hearing conglomerate in the world. The combined company changed its name to WS Audiology in 2019.
