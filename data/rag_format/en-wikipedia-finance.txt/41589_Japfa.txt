The company's operations in Indonesia originated in 1959, when Ferry Teguh Santosa founded PT Ometraco as a diversified group. Japfa was founded in 1971 at Surabaya, as a joint venture between Ometraco and German firm Internationale Graanhandel Thegrau to manufacture copra pellets and coconut oil. Its name was initially PT Java Pelletizing Factory. In 1982, Ometraco took over Thegrau's stake. Ferry's son, Handojo Santosa, joined Japfa in 1986 and later took over management of the company. Japfa entered the aquaculture industry in 1987.

It had its initial public offering at the Jakarta and Surabaya Stock Exchanges in 1989.
