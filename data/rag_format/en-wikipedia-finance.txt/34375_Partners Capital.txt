Partners Capital


# Partners Capital



**Partners Capital Investment Group, LLC** is an investment firm. As of July 2024, the 360-person firm had US$60 billion in assets under management.


## Overview

Partners Capital acts as the OCIO to endowments, foundations and high-net-worth private clients. Its private clients are primarily money managers, including senior partners and founders of investment firms. The firm was founded in London in 2001 by Stan Miranda and Paul Dimitruk. Since its inception, the firm has grown from US$10 million in assets to US$60 billion in 2024. Today, the firm has offices in London, Boston, New York, San Francisco, Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong and has over 360 employees.

The firm invests exclusively with unaffiliated managers with which it shares no economics. The firm believes that the OCIO’s role should be entirely separate from the role of managing assets.

Partners Capital has commented publicly about the need for the ”Yale Model” of endowment investing to evolve to reflect key lessons of the global financial crisis.


### Notable clients

Partners Capital has clients globally. Notable European institutional clients include individual colleges at Cambridge and Oxford universities, INSEAD, the Royal Academy of Arts and the National Gallery Trust.

Notable US institutional clients include the Research Foundation for the State University of New York’s University System, Syracuse University, Milton Academy, the Berkshire School, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Cancer Research Institute.
