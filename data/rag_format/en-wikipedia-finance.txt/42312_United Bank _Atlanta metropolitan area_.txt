## History


### Foundation

In 1905, the *Bank of Zebulon* was founded by a group of local business men from Zebulon, Georgia. In the middle of the Great Depression many banks were failing and losing hope that economic system of the United States would soon overcome this downfall. During this time, however, United Bank (then the Bank of Zebulon) became the 172nd bank in the nation to become a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1935.


### Milestones

In 1972, Lamar State Bank of Barnesville, Georgia was established. This was one of the first new branches taken on by what was later the United Bank Corporation. By 1981, United Bank Corporation was formed as a holding company for its additional banks and branches. At this point, the only banks included in this were the Bank of Zebulon and Lamar State Bank. In the mid 1980s the banks owned by the United Bank Corporation changed their names to United Bank and the mortgage division of United Bank was established. By 1990, United Bank continued to expand with its purchase of First Federal Bank in Griffin, Georgia. Throughout the mid 1990s, United Bank began to provide bank branches within grocery stores and a local call center that provided full customer service over the phone. In 1997 United Bank provided a division of the bank for investment management and also acquired the offices in Thomaston, Georgia of NationsBank, N.A.

Over the years, United Bank not only opened up new branches on its own, but also bought out many failing banks in the area.
