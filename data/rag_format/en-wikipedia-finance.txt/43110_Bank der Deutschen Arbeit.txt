Bank der Deutschen Arbeit


# Bank der Deutschen Arbeit



The ***Bank der deutschen Arbeit*** (**BdA**, lit. 'Bank of German Labor') was a financial institution of the German Labor Front (DAF), based in Berlin.


## Overview

Founded in 1924 as the Bank of Workers, Employees, and Civil Servants (German: ***Bank der Arbeiter, Angestellten und Beamten AG***) by organizations representing these groups, the bank was taken over by the DAF and renamed after the Nazi government banned all independent trade unions on 2 May 1933. Its assets expanded rapidly under the Nazi government, from 151 million Reichsmarks at end-1931 to 918 million in 1939.³⁶

The existence of the BdA came to an abrupt end in 1945, as the allied occupation forces agreed to liquidate it.³²⁶


## Head office

The BdA appropriated an office building at Wallstrasse 61-65 in Berlin, which had been commissioned by the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB, dissolved in 1933) from architects Max Taut and Franz Hoffmann [de] and built in 1922-1923, then extended in 1930-1932 along Wallstrasse on a design by Walter Würzbach [de]. From 1945 to 1990, it became the seat of the Free German Trade Union Federation. It has since been used as a commercial office building.
