# Parag Saxena



**Parag Saxena** (Hindi: **पराग सक्सेना**; born 27 April 1955) is an Indian investment manager that is Co-Founder and General Partner of Vedanta Capital. He had previously founded Invesco Private Capital, a subsidiary of Invesco, and New Silk Route.


## Early life and education

Saxena earned a B.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, an M.S. in Chemical Engineering from the West Virginia College of Graduate Studies and an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.


## Career

Saxena started his career at Becton Dickinson as a product manager in 1978. Saxena was subsequently the Managing Partner and founded Invesco Private Capital, a subsidiary of Invesco. Parag, over the course of four years, consistently qualified for *Forbes* Midas List. Parag was named the 23rd, 38th, 31st and 28th best deal maker in venture capital in the 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 lists, respectively.

He spent 23 years at Invesco Private Capital. He also worked at Chancellor Capital Management, acquired by Invesco in 1998. He stepped down as managing partner of Invesco Private Capital in April 2006, with the *New York Times* noting many investors had been leaving the company, and quoting him as noting that conflict among management and lawsuits against Invesco had made it increasingly hard to raise funds.

In 2006, he co-founded New Silk Route with Rajat Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam, as well as Mark Schwartz. The fund closed to investors in late 2008. Raja Gupta filed a lawsuit against Saxena in 2013, alleging Saxena in 2012 started limiting his access to New Silk Route after Gupta had sentenced in 2012 for securities fraud. The lawsuit was dismissed by a judge in 2013 for being irrelevant.


## Personal life

He and Usha Saxena have several children together.
