## Description

In the spring of 2011, Ostchem Holding strengthened its position in Ukraine by acquiring the right to import Central Asian gas for chemical companies. In 2011, the company bought gas in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, importing 4.8 billion cubic meters of fuel a year. But since 2012, Ostchem has been buying gas directly from Gazprom. Ostchem, having supplanted the state monopoly of Naftogaz Ukrainy, received special price conditions for gas supplies. In January, Naftogaz was the only importer of Russian gas to the country, including Ostchem, which bought 2.4 billion cubic meters from Gazprom. But since February 2013, the situation has changed. "Naftogaz bought in Russia only 0.4 billion cubic meters, and Ostchem - 2.4 billion, exceeding its quarterly needs.

It is among world leading companies in production of nitrate, ammonia, and urea. Ostchem made its mother company Group DF third biggest world producer of ammonia in the world in 2013 yielding only to Norwegian Yara International, American CF Industries and surpassing Canadian PotashCorp.
