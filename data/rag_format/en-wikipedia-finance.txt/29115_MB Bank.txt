## Incident

On January 8, 2020, some individual customers of MB Bank were able to spend beyond their account balance and card limit. A system error allowed them to make payments and withdrawals even if they did not have enough money in their accounts.

Immediately after detecting the incident, MB blocked the accounts of these customers and requested them to refund the overspent amount. The bank confirmed that the incident did not affect the operations of MB and the assets of other customers. A representative of MB Bank acknowledged the occurrence of an online transaction error exceeding the limit.
