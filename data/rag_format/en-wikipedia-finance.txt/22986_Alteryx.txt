**Alteryx, Inc.** is an American computer software company based in Irvine, California, with offices worldwide. The company's products are used for data science and analytics.


## History

SRC LLC, the predecessor to Alteryx, was founded in 1997 by Dean Stoecker, Olivia Duane Adams and Ned Harding. SRC developed the first online data engine for delivering demographic-based mapping and reporting shortly after being founded. In 1998, SRC released Allocate, a data engine incorporating geographically organized U.S. Census data that allows users to manipulate, analyze and map data. Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.

In 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the U.S. Census Bureau that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on CD-ROMs of Census Data sold by the Bureau.

In 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.

In 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.

In 2011, Alteryx raised $6 million in venture funding from the Palo Alto investment arm of SAP AG, SAP Ventures. In 2013, Alteryx raised $12 million from SAP Ventures and Toba Capital. In 2014, the company raised $60 million in Round B funding from Insight Venture Partners, Sapphire Ventures (formerly SAP Ventures) and Toba Capital, and announced plans for a 30% workforce expansion.

In 2015, ICONIQ Capital led an $85 million investment in Alteryx, with Insight Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners also participating. Alteryx announced plans to use the new capital to expand internationally, invest in research and development, and increase its sales and marketing efforts.

On March 24, 2017, Alteryx went public in an IPO listed on the NYSE. In October, it was discovered that Alteryx was subject to a data breach of partially anonymized data records for approximately 120 million U.S. households.

In October 2020, Alteryx announced Mark Anderson as CEO, with Stoecker becoming Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors.

In December 2023, it was announced that two private equity firms, Clearlake Capital and Insight Partners, would acquire the company in a US$4.4 billion deal, intending to make it private until the beginning of the following year. On March 19, 2024, the transaction was completed.

## 2017 data breach

Also included was "consumer demographics, life event, direct response, property, and mortgage information for more than 235 million consumers" according to the company.
