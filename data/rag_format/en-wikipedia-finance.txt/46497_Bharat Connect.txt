## Background

The Committee headed by RBI Executive Director G. Padmanabhan was set up in 2013 to study the feasibility of implementation of Giro based Payment Systems. It had estimated that over 30,800 million bills amounting to ₹6223 billion are generated each year in the top 20 cities in the country.

It was felt that an integrated bill payment system is required in the country that could offer interoperable and accessible bill payment services to customers through a network of agents, allow multiple payment modes, and provide instant confirmation of payment. This should also serve as an efficient, cost-effective alternative to the existing systems and enhance consumer confidence and experience.

On 6 August 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed BBPS cross border inward billing facility for Non-resident Indians. NRIs can now directly pay utility bills, education fees, municipal tax and insurance-related payments without the need to send money first to a resident Indian bank account. The facility became active from 13 September 2022. On 20 September, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das officially launched Bharat BillPay Cross-Border Bill Payments at Global Fintech Fest 2022.

At the Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2024, Vivek Deep, executive director of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), announced the rebranding of the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) to Bharat Connect.


### Unified Presentment Management System

NPCI on 4 January 2022 launched Unified Presentment Management System (UPMS) for recurring payment. Customers can set up standing instructions for any mode of payment. The payment will be done automatically in terms of auto-debit and bill payment management. UPMS will help in payment of mutual funds, insurance, subscriptions, school fee payments etc.


### Bharat Connect QR

Bharat Connect QR operates on a Scan, Fetch, and Pay model. Using this model, customers can make the bill payments by scanning the QR code, which will fetch the latest bill through the BOU. The customer can then proceed to pay directly within the same app. Clickpay QR was launched by Google Pay in collaboration with Bharat Billpay at the Global Fintech Fest 2024. With this functionality, customers can pay their bills by just using the Google Pay app to scan a Clickpay QR code. Users don't need to memorize account numbers or customer IDs because the QR code—which billers can generate—automatically retrieves the most recent bill details.
