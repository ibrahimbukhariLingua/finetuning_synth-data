On June 20, 2012, the Court found that the defendants [Goldfarb] were in breach of the Final Judgment by failing to pay the disgorgement amounts ordered. The Court also found that defendants had failed to establish a good faith effort to fulfill their disgorgement obligations because, among other things, they used available funds for large personal expenses such as courtside seats to Golden State Warriors games, charters of aircraft for personal trips, Goldfarb's mortgage payment and numerous personal vacations, rather than to pay disgorgement.
