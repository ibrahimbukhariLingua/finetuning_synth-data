# Dynatrace



**Dynatrace, Inc.** is a technology company that provides a software observability platform. Dynatrace technologies are used to monitor, analyze, and optimize application performance, software development and security practices, IT infrastructure, and user experience for businesses and government agencies throughout the world.

The Dynatrace observability platform uses a proprietary form of AI called Davis to discover, map, and monitor applications, microservices, container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, and IT infrastructure running in multicloud, hybrid-cloud, and hyperscale network environments. The platform also provides automated problem remediation and IT carbon impact analysis. The platform provides observability across the solution stack to manage the complexities of cloud native computing, and support digital transformation and cloud migration.


## Product

The Dynatrace unified observability and security platform uses AI to provide infrastructure monitoring, applications and microservices monitoring, application security, digital experience, business analytics, and cloud automation capabilities. Dynatrace also provides the Dynatrace Hub, which publishes Dynatrace applications for specific observability use cases and integrations with more than 620 technologies including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker, Java, and Prometheus.

The Dynatrace platform consists of the following technologies:

* OneAgent for automated data collection
* Smartscape for continuously updated topology mapping and visualization
* PurePath for code-level distributed tracing
* AppEngine for building custom applications based on observability, security, and business data
* AutomationEngine for building custom automated DevOps workflows
* Grail data lakehouse with indexless, schema-on-read storage for contextual data analytics and management using massively parallel processing and the proprietary Dynatrace query language (DQL), which uses a sequence of commands to chain (pipe)Â data processing operations.
* Davis, a proprietary AI engine that combines multiple AI techniques including causal-AI for automatic root-cause fault-tree analysis, predictive analytics, and generative AI.

Dynatrace provides multicloud observability to both SaaS and managed service deployment models, in partnership with service providers including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, among others.


## Open source contributions

Dynatrace invests in building DevOps and SRE automation and contributes developments to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), including the contribution of Keptn, an open-source pluggable control plane for cloud-native application lifecycle orchestration. Dynatrace is a key contributor and investor in open-source community activities around observability and performance. Examples include W3C Trace Context, of which Dynatrace is a founding member and co-chair; OpenTelemetry; and OpenFeature. Other open-source technologies Dynatrace contributes to include MONACO, Barista, and Dynahist.
