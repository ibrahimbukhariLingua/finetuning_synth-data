## Critical reception

Leonard Maltin wrote, "engaging Western with two sidekicks (Hayes and Hatton) touches upon Depression-era subjects of corrupt banking institutions and foreclosures; fun to watch Roy riding in a steeplechase and singing in a nightclub (wearing a coat and tie)"; and Dennis Schwartz wrote, "this Roy Rogers film had an undeserved bad reputation. I actually found it to be one of his better B Westerns, it was at least up to par with the typical Rogers action-packed oater except that the singing cowboy only sang a few songs. It uses the present as its setting. Joseph Kane ("The Arizona Kid"/"Jesse James at Bay"/"Frontier Pony Express") directs in his usual credible fashion and it's ably written by Gerald Geraghty and Norman S. Hall."
