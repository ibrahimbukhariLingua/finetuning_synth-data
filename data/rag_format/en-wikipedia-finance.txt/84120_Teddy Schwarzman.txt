## Career

Schwarzman was a corporate lawyer at Skadden, a New York-based firm, where he specialized in real estate and corporate restructuring. He left Skadden to work in the film industry; his first job was as a personal assistant on *The Other Woman*, which was produced in 2009 and released in 2010. He later said of the experience: "It was one of those situations that you had to prove that you actually want to be in this business." He went on to work for John Sloss's film advisory company, Cinetic Media, where he was involved in raising funds to produce the 2011 films *Bernie* and *The Loneliest Planet*.

Schwarzman left Cinetic in 2011 to found his own production company, Black Bear Pictures, of which he is the president and CEO. There, the first film he produced was *At Any Price* (2012), followed by the 2013 films *Broken City*, *A.C.O.D.* and *All Is Lost*. His fifth and most successful film was *The Imitation Game*, a 2014 biopic about Alan Turing, which he produced alongside Nora Grossman and Ido Ostrowsky. Schwarzman bought Graham Moore's screenplay when Warner Bros. sold it in 2012, competing with 30 other producers who wanted to acquire the script. *The Imitation Game* received many accolades, including Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations for Best Picture and Best British Film, respectively. Schwarzman, Grossman and Ostrowsky were also nominated for a Producers Guild of America Award.
