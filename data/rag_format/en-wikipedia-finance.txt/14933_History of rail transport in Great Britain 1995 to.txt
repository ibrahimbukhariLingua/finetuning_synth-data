History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date


# History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date



The period from 1995 covers the history of rail transport in Great Britain following the privatisation of British Rail. During this period, passenger volumes have grown rapidly, safety has improved, and subsidies per journey have fallen. However, there is debate as to whether this is due to privatisation or to better government regulation. During this period, High Speed 1, the West Coast Main Line upgrade and Crossrail were completed and more construction projects are currently under way.
The period also saw the demise of privately-owned Railtrack and its replacement with government-owned Network Rail.

Overall rail subsidies have risen, as shown in the graph, although spend per journey has decreased. Rail subsidies have increased from £3.4 billion in 1992–93 to £4.5 billion in 2015–16 (in current prices), although subsidy per journey has fallen from £4.57 to £2.61. However, this masks great regional variation: for instance, in 2014–15 funding varied from "£1.41 per passenger journey in England to £6.51 per journey in Scotland and £8.34 per journey in Wales."

Due to the increase in passenger numbers and the prospect of high speed rail both within Great Britain and connecting to Europe, this period has been called the start of a new Golden Age of rail travel. However quickly increasing passenger numbers have meant many trains (as many as 1 in 6 in some places) are very crowded at peak times. Peak-time fares have increased by over 200% (since privatisation) to deter people from travelling at these times, whereas the price of advance tickets has halved in the same period. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a massive drop in passenger numbers, even though freight transport held up fairly well.


## Government policy


### Reform under the Labour government (1997–2010)

The Labour government (elected in 1997 after the majority of the privatisation process had been completed) did not completely reverse the railway privatisation of the previous administration. Initially it left the new structure largely in place, however its main innovation in the early years was the creation of the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), initially in shadow form until the Transport Act 2000 received Royal Assent, as well as the appointment of Tom Winsor as Rail Regulator, who took a much harder line with the rail industry, and Railtrack in particular.

In the wake of the Hatfield rail crash in 2000, Railtrack entered into financial meltdown and the industry was in deep crisis. Labour refused to continue to bail out Railtrack and the company was put into Railway Administration in 2001 and a new company, Network Rail emerged to replace Railtrack in 2002. Since September 2014, Network Rail has been classified as a "government body".

The Strategic Rail Authority lasted just five years. Following the passing of the Railways Act 2005, its business was wound up and its functions transferred to the Department for Transport Rail Group and the Office of Rail Regulation. Further changes followed, which saw the government take back a greater degree of control.

Another important development occurred in the aftermath of the Potters Bar accident in May 2002 when a commuter train derailed (coincidentally on the same stretch of the East Coast Main Line as Hatfield) due to poorly maintained points. This resulted in Network Rail taking all track maintenance back in-house and the industry went on to enjoy the longest period in modern times without a fatal accident due to industry error. This came to an end in February 2007 when a Virgin Trains West Coast Class 390 Pendolino derailed near Grayrigg in Cumbria, killing one person. The cause of the accident was identical to that in Potters Bar nearly five years earlier – once again calling into question Network Rail's maintenance procedures.

In 2006, the government launched the *Access for All* programme to improve accessibility at railway stations in Great Britain. The £390 million main programme (extended in 2014 with a further £163 million) has delivered accessibility projects at more than 150 stations.

In 2007, the government's preferred option was to use diesel trains running on biodiesel, its White Paper *Delivering a Sustainable Railway*, ruling out large-scale Railway electrification in Great Britain for the following five years.

Following Gordon Brown's appointment as prime minister in 2007, Andrew Adonis was appointed Transport Secretary. He immediately began work on plans for a new high-speed route between London and Birmingham (later known as High Speed 2), which would augment the West Coast Main Line. Adonis also announced plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London as far as Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England to remove diesel traction from certain key routes. Late in 2009, the InterCity East Coast franchise collapsed for the second time in three years when incumbent operator National Express East Coast (NXEC) proved unable to meet its financial obligations. Adonis transferred the franchise to the state-owned Directly Operated Railways to operate the route under its East Coast subsidiary.

In February 2009, the Department for Transport set up a company called Diesel Trains Ltd with the intention of funding and managing the procurement of up to 200 diesel multiple unit vehicles as part of the British Government's planned purchase of as many as 1300 new rail vehicles. It was incorporated following the announcement of the first 200 vehicles in late 2008 as part of the Pre-Budget Report – the speed of this announcement (the final contract to be signed in April 2009) led the government to take the lead in financing the procurement, through a public company. However, the DfT stated that it did not intend to serve in the long-term as a lessor of rolling stock. As a consequence, the DfT planned to sell Diesel Trains Ltd once the procurement process was completed, either as a whole, or by selling its assets and contracts.

Diesel Trains Ltd was to have responsibility for the purchase and distribution of 202 DMU vehicles to three TOCs – First Great Western, First TransPennine Express and Northern Rail. The order itself was to encompass a total of 61 trains, with 19 four-car and 42 three-car.

Following the announcement in August 2009 that the Great Western Main Line was to be electrified, the order for 202 DMUs was cancelled. After lying dormant for three years, Diesel Trains Ltd was dissolved in July 2012.


### Reform under the Coalition government (2010–2015)

After the 2010 General Election, the new Conservative led Coalition continued Labour's rail policies largely unaltered after a pause to review the finances. There was continuing support for the High Speed 2 scheme and further developing plans for the route, although great debate still rages over the scheme's benefits and costs. Whilst initially showing scepticism towards the electrification schemes of the Great Western route, they later gave the project its backing and work began formally in 2012.

In July 2012, the government published a £9.4 billion High Level Output Specification for the 2014–2019 period, which includes £4.2 billion of new schemes. This includes the Electric Spine project to electrify the railway between Southampton in the south and Nuneaton and Sheffield in the north, electrification of the Midland Main Line from Bedford to Sheffield, Cardiff–Swansea and Valley Lines electrification, and the Western Rail Approach to Heathrow. The Electric Spine, Midland Main Line electrification and Cardiff–Swansea electrification were later scrapped in July 2017. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Western Rail Approach to Heathrow was shelved in January 2021.

In 2012, the franchising system again came under criticism after FirstGroup was awarded the InterCity West Coast franchise. Incumbent Virgin Rail Group initiated a judicial review against the decision, citing the fact that First's bid was even more ambitious than the one which had scuttled National Express East Coast less than three years earlier. Before the review took place however, newly installed Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin scrapped the entire bidding process for the franchise and granted Virgin an extension to its contract when "severe technical flaws" were discovered in the original bidding competition.


### The Conservative government (2015–2024)

The government has moved towards allowing more competition on the intercity network through open access operators. In 2015 it approved a service run by Alliance Rail Holdings to operate between London Euston and Blackpool, and in 2016 it allowed FirstGroup to run open access services on the East Coast Main Line from October 2021 under the operating name Lumo.


#### Fare increases

Much debate continues over annual fare increases, although the government pledged in August 2015 to keep regulated rail fare increases at Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation for the remainder of the 2015 Parliament. In addition much debate has continued over the financing of various rail schemes driven primarily by the huge cost and time overrun on the GWML route modernisation and electrification scheme. In connection with this, and to coincide with the Chancellor's Autumn statement in November 2015, the Bowe and Hendy reports were produced.


#### 2016–2019 rail strikes

Since April 2016, the British railway network has been severely disrupted on many occasions by wide-reaching rail strikes, affecting rail franchises across the country. The industrial action began on Southern services as a dispute over the planned introduction of driver-only operation, and has since expanded to cover many different issues affecting the rail industry; as of February 2018, the majority of the industrial action remains unresolved, with further strikes planned. The scale, impact and bitterness of the nationwide rail strikes have been compared to the 1984–85 miners' strike by the media.


#### Cost of living crisis and the 2022–2023 rail strikes

Due to the cost-of-living crisis, RMT union members at Network Rail and 13 train operating companies voted in favour of strike action on 24 May 2022. It was the first national strike at Network Rail since 1994. On 11 July 2022, ASLEF union members at 8 train operating companies and TSSA members at Southeastern also voted in favour of strike action. RMT members voted to accept a pay deal with Network Rail in March 2023 and the industrial action in Scotland and Wales ended in May 2023, while the RMT dispute with the Rail Delivery Group is ongoing as of September 2023.

As a response to the cost-of-living crisis, the government approved a 5.9% rise in rail fares from 5 March 2023, which was 6.4 percentage points below the RPI inflation rate in July 2022 which is normally used to calculate fare increases.

In July 2023, the government announced plans to close the majority of ticket offices. The plan was abandoned in October 2023.


#### Infrastructure projects

In March 2016, the National Infrastructure Commission said that Crossrail 2 should be taken forward "as a priority" and recommended that a bill should pass through Parliament by 2019 and the line should be open by 2033. Crossrail 2 is a north–south railway through London, similar to the east–west railway Crossrail which is currently under construction.

In July 2017, Chris Grayling, the secretary of state for transport announced a number of electrification schemes were to be suspended indefinitely citing the disruptive nature of electrification works and the availability of bi-mode technology. The schemes included aspects of the GWML including Cardiff to Swansea, the Midland Main Line from Kettering to Sheffield via Derby and Nottingham and Oxenholme to Windermere in the Lake District.

In February 2018, the five-year plan was published by Network Rail with significant investment though much of this was for renewals and smaller projects rather than major projects. In March 2019 the Railway Industry Association published a paper entitled Electrification Cost Challenge.

In July 2019, the Urban Transport Group released a report that showed regional rail travel had experienced a 29% growth in the ten years to 2017/18.

On 24 July 2019, Grant Shapps was appointed Secretary of State for Transport under the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The Transport Select Committee have met on a number of occasions since early 2020 and considered the 'Trains Fit for the Future" ongoing enquiry which was started under the previous session under Lilian Greenwood's chairship. The report, published in March 2021, recommended a rolling programme of electrification and for the DfT to quickly publish a list of “no regret” electrification schemes. It was stated that Network Rail had already supplied a list to the DfT.

The TDNS (Traction Decarbonisation Network Strategy) Interim Business case was published in September 2020. The main theme was electrification of 13,000 single track kilometres (8,100 miles) of UK railways.

In September 2020, the government abolished the rail franchising system. On 20 May 2021, the government announced and published a white paper that detailed how it would transform the operation of the railways. The rail network will be partly renationalised, with infrastructure and operations brought together under a new company Great British Railways. Operations will be managed on a concessions model. According to the BBC, this represents the largest shake-up in the UK's railways since privatisation.

On 18 November 2021, the Integrated Rail Plan (IRP) was published. This affected parts of the HS2 programme including curtailing much of the eastern leg but did include full Midland Main Line electrification and upgrades. Also included was a commitment to the Transpennine north railway upgrade to include full electrification.

On the back of the IRP, the Union Connectivity Review was also published in November 2021. The Union Connectivity Review was announced on 30 June 2020 by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It was stated that Sir Peter Hendy would chair the review. The terms of reference were published 3 October 2020. An interim report was published March 2021.

The final report was published on 25 November 2021. In December 2021 The Telegraph newspaper reported in an apparent leak, that the treasury had decided not to provide funds for further electrification and thus help to decarbonise the railways.

The official announcement and confirmation that the Midland Main Line between Kettering and Market Harborough was being electrified and spades would be in the ground starting 24 December 2021 was made on 21 December 2021.


## COVID-19 pandemic effect on railways in Great Britain

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom occurred in this period and caused a catastrophic fall off in the number of passengers using the rail network although freight held up reasonably well. While passenger numbers had recovered to over 80% of their pre-Covid levels by July-September 2022, how this will affect the long-term health of the rail industry remains to be seen. Despite the pandemic the Traction Decarbonisation Strategy Interim Business case was published in July 2020. In addition, Network Rail also published its Environmental sustainability strategy.

In direct response to falling passenger numbers and revenues, the Wales & Borders operator Transport for Wales Rail was put into public ownership by the Welsh Government on 7 February 2021.


## Infrastructure projects


### Completed projects

The British railway system continues to be developed. Contemporary projects include:

* The West Coast Main Line upgrade (West Coast Main Line route modernisation) was a long-term project covering a series of technical aspects. Improvements included the four-tracking (from three) of the Trent Valley (a bypass of the West Midlands), redesigning the layout of several junction/stations e.g. Rugby and other associated work to increase line speed. This culminated in tilting trains at 125 mph being extended to Glasgow in 2005. The cost overruns of the programme are infamous – attributed to the wide scope of the programme (the promise to Virgin to build a 140 mph railway which would require moving block signalling) and poor project management by the defunct Railtrack.

#### England

* High Speed 1, a project to construct a 67-mile (108 km) high-speed rail line from London to the British end of the Channel Tunnel, and involving a great deal of complex civil engineering including a 1,404-yard (1,284 m) bridge over the River Medway, a 2-mile (3.2 km) tunnel under the Thames near Dartford, a 2-mile tunnel through the North Downs, 12-mile (19 km) twin tunnels running into central London, a major new railway station extension to London St Pancras, and a complex redesign and rebuild of the King's Cross St Pancras tube station. The southern phase 1 of the project opened in September 2003, and northern phase 2 opened in November 2007.
* The Thameslink Programme started in 2009 and was completed in September 2020. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaducts) and new rolling stock, which has allowed Govia Thameslink Railway to expand their Thameslink services to more destinations on the north and south.
* Crossrail was a railway construction project in London and its environs. Its aim is to provide a high-frequency hybrid commuter rail/rapid transit passenger service that links parts of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, via central London, to Essex and South East London. Work began in 2009 on the central section of the line—a new tunnel through central London—and connections to the Great Western Main Line and Great Eastern Main Line that would become part of Crossrail. The central section from Paddington to Abbey Wood opened as the Elizabeth line on 24 May 2022. The introduction of the full peak timetable with 24 trains per hour and direct services between Heathrow Airport and Essex on 21 May 2023 marked the practical completion of the project.
* The Northern Hub was a rail project across Northern England aimed at stimulating economic growth by increasing train services, reducing journey times and electrifying lines between the major cities and towns in the north. The project was announced as the Manchester Hub, entailing a series of upgrades to increase capacity and cut journey times between cities in Northern England by resolving rail bottlenecks around Manchester city centre. Manchester Piccadilly was planned to have two new through platforms constructed to increase the frequency of trains from 10 per hour to 14, but the plan was withdrawn in 2023. Manchester Victoria station was modernised (including electrification, a new Metrolink station and a new roof) to become the east–west rail interchange in northern England. Services from Liverpool to Leeds and beyond will be diverted from the Cheshire Lines route via Warrington Central and Manchester Piccadilly to the electrified line via Newton-le-Willows and Manchester Victoria. Trains from the north east to Manchester Airport now use a new section of railway, the £85 million Ordsall Chord, between Manchester Victoria and Manchester Oxford Road to access Manchester Piccadilly and continue to the airport without the need to reverse at Piccadilly and without conflicting movements at the station throat. The chord opened on 10 December 2017.
* The electrification of both the Liverpool to Manchester northern route and the Liverpool–Wigan line were completed in 2015 and electric Class 319 trains (on the Liverpool to Manchester Airport service) and Class 350s (on the Manchester Airport to Scotland services) have replaced diesel units. The Preston–Blackpool North line and the Manchester–Preston line have been electrified with electric Class 319 trains entering service on 20 May 2018 and 11 February 2019 respectively.
* Electrification of the Cross-City Line to Bromsgrove has been completed, which allowed electric trains to run from summer 2018.

#### Scotland

* The Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine railway, a 13-mile (21 km) extension to the network, to the north of the Firth of Forth in Scotland. A Bill for the railway was passed by the Scottish Parliament and received Royal Assent in August 2004. Work commenced in September 2005, with services running by early 2008. The line re-establishes a railway decommissioned in 1983; the new line provided passenger connections to Glasgow, and freight links between the site of Kincardine power station, now used as a loading point for coal from open-cast sites, to avoid heavy traffic through Kincardine, and Longannet power station, and the coal terminals at Hunterston Deep Water Port. Longannet power station closed in 2016. The passenger part of the scheme, from Stirling to Alloa was in any case secure, and the Scottish Parliament appear to be in favour of passenger services being extended to Rosyth. This could possibly result in passenger stations serving the communities of Clackmannan, Kincardine, and Culross or Valleyfield, and through trains once more from Stirling to Dunfermline.
* A short extension of the Glasgow-Hamilton-Motherwell, which once again links Larkhall to the railway network after 40 years. Larkhall has for some time been the largest town in Scotland without a railway station. The new £35 million line follows an existing formation, and services to Larkhall railway station resumed on 12 December 2005. The new section of route is electrified and is served with trains from Dalmuir, via Glasgow Central Low Level, with connections from other northern suburbs of Glasgow such as Milngavie.
* The Airdrie–Bathgate rail link was a project to upgrade the railway between Airdrie and Bathgate. The route, originally part of the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway, was completely closed in 1982 and reopened as a single track railway in 1986. The project included double tracking, electrification, new stations at Blackridge and Armadale, and the relocation of Drumgelloch and Bathgate station. Passenger services on the upgraded line began on 12 December 2010, but the opening of three new stations was delayed to March 2011 due to severe weather. The project cost £300 million.
* The Glasgow Airport Rail Link was given the go-ahead by the Scottish Parliament in December 2006 but the project was scrapped by the new SNP minority government in September 2009. A new 1.5-mile (2.4 km) spur was to be built onto the existing Inverclyde route. An element of the project that did go ahead was upgrading the Glasgow Central – Paisley line to triple track to increase capacity on the Ayrshire and Inverclyde routes. This work was completed in 2012.
* A 35-mile (56 km) section of the Waverley Route from Edinburgh to Tweedbank in the Scottish Borders has been rebuilt after approval by the Scottish Parliament, which reopened on 6 September 2015. This project, also known as the Borders Railway, restored rail services to communities which have lacked access to the National Rail network since the Beeching cuts.
* The Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme or **EGIP** was an initiative started by the Scottish Government to increase capacity on the main railway line between Edinburgh and Glasgow via Falkirk. As part of the programme, the new Edinburgh Gateway station opened on 9 December 2016. Electric services on the line began on 10 December 2017. The opening of the redeveloped Glasgow Queen Street station on 4 October 2021 marked the completion of the programme. The final cost was estimated to be £870 million.
* The rolling programme of electrification in Scotland saw lines from Edinburgh and Glasgow electrified to Stirling, Dunblane and Alloa.
* The £160 million Edinburgh to Glasgow Central line via Shotts electrification was completed on time and on budget.

#### Wales

* The Welsh Assembly Government re-opened 18 miles (29 km) of Vale of Glamorgan Line between Barry and Bridgend in June 2005.
* The 18-mile (29 km) Ebbw Valley Railway between Ebbw Vale Parkway and Cardiff Central was reopened to passenger services on 6 February 2008. An extension of the line to Ebbw Vale Town opened on 11 June 2015.

### Current developments


#### England

* High Speed 2 (HS2) is a high-speed railway under construction which will initially link the cities of London and Birmingham, followed by further extension to North West England and East Midlands. Construction of the first phase of HS2 began on 3 September 2020 with a planned opening date of between 2029 and 2033, while Phase 2a is expected to open between 2030 and 2034 and the western leg of Phase 2b between 2035 and 2041. Phase 1 of HS2 was planned to run between London Euston and the new Birmingham Curzon Street station, but due to delays at Euston, services will initially terminate at Old Oak Common. Phase 2a will run from Birmingham to Crewe, while Phase 2b will have two branches: a western leg from Crewe to Manchester Piccadilly, and an eastern leg from Birmingham Interchange to the proposed East Midlands Parkway station, the original plan serving Leeds via East Midlands Hub and Meadowhall Interchange having been scrapped by the Integrated Rail Plan. Phase 2a from Lichfield to Crewe received Royal Assent on 11 February 2021.
* On the Great Western Main Line, Network Rail plans to spend £5 billion on modernising the GWML and its South Wales branch plus other associated lines like the North Cotswolds which was completed in 2011. The modernisation plans were announced at separate times but their development time-scales overlap each other to represent a comprehensive modernisation plan for the Great Western and its associated lines in the 2010s. The modernisation includes electrification, resignalling, new rolling stock and station upgrades. According to Network Rail, the modernisation started in June 2010 and was projected to end in 2017. On 8 November 2016 the government announced that several elements of the Great Western Main Line electrification programme would be indefinitely deferred due to cost overruns and delays. Subsequently, in July 2017, Cardiff–Swansea electrification was cancelled. Electric services began running between London and Cardiff on 5 January 2020.
* The Transpennine Route Upgrade is a long-term upgrade project on the railway between Manchester and York via Leeds, which includes the Huddersfield line and part of the Cross Country Route. The upgrade includes line speed increases, electrification and station remodelling (including the relocation of Morley station). As of July 2022, the whole upgrade was projected to be completed by 2041.
* The Midland Main Line upgrade is an upgrade project on the Midland Main Line which includes electrification, line speed increases, station remodelling and power supply upgrades. As a result of the upgrade, East Midlands Railway started running electric services from Corby to St Pancras on 17 May 2021. Work on electrifying the line between Kettering and Market Harborough started on 24 December 2021. Subsequently, the next phase of electrifying the section between Market Harborough and Wigston began on 3 November 2022.
* East West Rail is a project to re-establish a railway line connecting Oxford and Cambridge via Bicester, Bletchley and Bedford, largely following the route of the former Varsity Line which was closed in 1968. The westernmost part of the project coincided with Phase 2 of the Evergreen 3 project and saw the Oxford–Bicester line upgraded to double track and 100 mph (160 km/h) running. Chiltern Railways introduced a new Oxford–Marylebone service on 12 December 2016. The construction of the new Winslow station began in late 2021.
* The Northumberland Line is a project to reintroduce passenger services to the currently freight-only line between Newcastle and Ashington. Originally built by the Blyth and Tyne Railway, passenger services on the line were withdrawn as part of the Beeching cuts. The project involves track replacement, signalling upgrades, closure of level crossings and the construction of six new stations. Following the granting of a Transport and Works Act Order, main works began in early 2022. As of March 2023, the line was expected to open in summer 2024.
* The £145 million Hope Valley line upgrade involves reinstating the second line and platform at Dore and Totley station, a new passing loop between Bamford and Hathersage to allow passenger trains to overtake slower freight trains and platform extensions to accommodate six-car trains. The construction of the second platform at Dore & Totley began on 15 July 2023. As of January 2023, the project was expected to be completed in spring 2024.
* The railway between Bolton and Wigan, which was first built as part of the Liverpool and Bury Railway, has been electrified. The £78 million electrification project was approved by the government on 1 September 2021. As part of the project, the platforms at Hindley, Westhoughton and Ince will be extended. The completion date will be 2025.

#### Scotland

* Scotland has committed to a rolling programme of electrification to decarbonise the network by 2045 but with an even more aggressive target for decarbonisation of the passenger network by 2035. The first announced project is the electrification of the route to Barrhead and East Kilbride. As well as electrification, double tracking from Busby to East Kilbride is planned as well as lengthening platforms at existing stations. Part of the project scope includes relocating Hairmyres station and a complete rebuild of East Kilbride station.
* Scotland has also published a plan and split it into components identified as: in delivery, in development or under active consideration. As of 2021 projects in delivery include improvements to Aberdeen Station and other renewals in the Carstairs area and also Motherwell. The electrification to East Kilbride is also included in this category. In 2021 projects considered in development are mainly those that support the decarbonisation agenda. New electrification will require new 25kV Grid Feeders and upgrading existing ones to handle the increased electrical load. Partial electrification of the Borders Railway are included here along with Barrhead and Haymarket to Dalmeny and Leven. Projects classed as under active consideration again are almost exclusively those supporting the decarbonisation agenda and include most if not all future phases of decarbonisation plan. All of Scotland's seven cities are included and thus include improvements and electrification the routes out of Aberdeen including to the Central Belt and Inverness. The Highland Main Line from Perth to Inverness is also included in the plan. This obviously requires continuation of the previous scheme from Stirling to Dunblane and Alloa. So Dunblane to Hilton junction and Perth along with all the other necessary infrastructure improvements such as route clearance are part of the infrastructure upgrade plan. The Fife Circle line and extensions to Longannet and Dundee and Perth are all part of this. Electrification in Ayrshire and south west of Glasgow are under active consideration too.
* The Levenmouth rail link is a £116 million project to reopen 8 kilometres (5 mi) of railway line in Fife connecting Leven with Thornton Junction. The project includes reinstating 19km of double track, constructing two new stations (Leven and Cameron Bridge) and electrification. Following project approval by Transport Scotland, construction started on 4 March 2022. The construction of Cameron Bridge station began on 24 January 2023, while that of Leven station began on 1 March 2023.

#### Wales

* The Welsh Assembly Government proposes to extend the Ebbw Valley line between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff into Newport in the future. The Assembly Government is also looking into opening the Hirwaun to Aberdare route in the Cynon Valley. In addition to further progress on the South Wales Metro, and North Wales Metro.
* The South Wales Metro is a project to improve services on the Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes. It involves electrification, double tracking, new Class 398, 756 and 231 rolling stock, new stations such as Crwys Road and a new depot and signalling centre at Taffs Well. The project aims to enable four trains per hour to run on each line. The first Class 398s arrived at the Taffs Well depot in March 2023.
