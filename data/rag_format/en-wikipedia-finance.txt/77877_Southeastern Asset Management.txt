## History

Southeastern Asset Management was founded by Mason Hawkins in 1975. In 1987, Southeastern created the Longleaf Partners Fund, its first mutual fund product, in order to allow its employees to invest in the funds owned by its clients. The Longleaf Small-Cap Fund was seeded two years later in 1989 as a way to invest in undervalued businesses that were too small for the firm's existing portfolios. The Small-Cap Fund later closed to new investors in 1997 and remains closed today.


### Longleaf Partners Mutual Funds

The Longleaf Partners Funds is a suite of mutual fund and UCITS fund products introduced into the market by Southeastern Asset Management in 1987 as a way for Southeastern employees to invest in the funds they managed. Southeastern's employees and their immediate families are limited by the firm's code of ethics to invest in public equities through the firm's funds unless granted an exception.

Longleaf's flagship fund, Longleaf Partners Fund, was launched in 1987 and was later followed by Longleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund in 1989, Longleaf Partners International Fund in 1998, and Longleaf Partners Global Fund in 2012.


### Separately Managed Accounts

Southeastern provides separately managed accounts for institutional investors with three mandates: U.S., Non-U.S. and Global. Its U.S. mandate dates back to 1975 and its Non-U.S. mandate began in 1998. In 2000, Southeastern created its Global separately managed account mandate for institutional investors, combining U.S. and non-U.S. companies in one portfolio in 2000.


### Longleaf Partners UCITS Funds

Longleaf Partnersâ€™ Global UCITS fund was created in 2010 for investors outside of the U.S. In 2012, the Longleaf Partners U.S. UCITS Fund was launched for investors outside of the U.S. to invest in U.S.-based companies.
