Salim Group


# Salim Group



The **Salim Group** is Indonesia's biggest conglomerate and refers to companies where the **Salim family** holds majority ownership. Its assets include Indofood Sukses Makmur, the world's largest instant noodle producer; Indomobil Group, one of Indonesia's largest car manufacturers; Indomaret, Indonesia's largest convenience store chain; and Bogasari, a large flour-milling operation. The group was founded in October 1972 by Sudono Salim and his junior partner Sutanto Djuhar (Lin Wenjing). The current CEO is Anthoni Salim, a son of Sudono Salim.

The Salim Group also owns major oil palm plantations (about 1,000 km²) and logging concessions. Salim Group has been involved in property development and the leisure industry for around 30 years. Its businesses include hotel and resort development, golf courses, and commercial real estate.


## History

The Salim Group was closely tied to Indonesian politician and dictator Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 31 years and was Sudono Salim's "friend and patron".
During the May 1998 riots that led to Suharto's downfall, Sudono Salim's house was burned down and he was forced to flee to Singapore.

In 1999, the group called off talks to sell a stake in Indofood to San Miguel Corporation, the largest food and beverage conglomerate in the Philippines, because of control questions.


## Projects in West Bengal

The Salim Group is involved in a number of projects in West Bengal, an eastern state of India. It is involved in the construction of Kolkata West International City. Salim and Universal Success are investors in the project, Ciputra is the developer, and Singapore-based Surbana is the project manager.

The proposal of the Salim Group for chemical hub and multi-product SEZ were cleared in principle by the board of approvals of the Union Commerce Ministry, Government of India, in October 2006.
