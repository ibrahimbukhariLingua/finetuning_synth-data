## History

Corporación Financiera Alba has its origins in Cementos Alba, a Spanish cement company controlled by the March Group, which began manufacturing cement in the 1950s. In 1986, Hornos Ibéricos, also a cement company whose majority shareholder was the Holderbank group (now Holcim Ltd), acquired its cement plants and concrete subsidiaries.

As a result of the sale of these industrial assets, Cementos Alba changed its name to Corporación Financiera Alba and used the proceeds from the divestment to become a financial holding company with a diversified portfolio of holdings in industrial and service companies.

Some of Corporación Financiera Alba's most representative investments, excluding the current ones, have been:

* Airtel, later Vodafone
