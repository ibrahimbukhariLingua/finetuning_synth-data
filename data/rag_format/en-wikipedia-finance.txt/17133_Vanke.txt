## History

Vanke was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 1991, the second listed company in the Shenzhen Stock Exchange after Shenzhen Development Bank. It had the largest market capitalisation in 2006 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

As of 2020, Vanke was ranked 208th in the Fortune Global 500. Fortune reported the company having US$53.253 billion in revenue, US$248.360 billion worth of assets, and 131,505 employees that year.

Vanke was also ranked 96th in the Forbes Global 2000 in 2020.

As of 21 February 2019 its market cap was US$44 billion.


### Financial struggle

In March 2024, Moody's Ratings downgraded Vanke's credit rating score to Ba1, citing "substantial credit risk" in the company.

Since the beginning of 2025, the company has been dealing with a huge amount of debt due amid a struggling property market. It has around 4.9 billion USD in bonds maturing in 2025, half of its public debt.


#### Chinese government intervention

China state media the Economic Observer reported that Vanke's CEO Zhu Jiusheng was detained by public security authorities on January 15, 2025.

Officials in Shenzhen held a closed meeting on January 17, 2025 to discuss Vanke, which is based in the city. The local government has significant control over Vanke due to its largest shareholder being a state firm. The Shenzhen government intended to stabilize Vanke's operations. They planned to introduce new auditors and financial advisers to evaluate Vanke’s finances and property projects for future actions.
