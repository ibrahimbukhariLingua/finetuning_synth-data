## Legal issues


### Bahria Town brand name controversy

In a significant legal dispute, business tycoon Malik Riaz was ordered by a Rawalpindi district court to pay Rs388.13 million as compensation to the Bahria Foundation for unauthorized use of the ‘Bahria’ brand name for his housing society. The dispute began in 1996 when Hussain Global, representing Riaz, partnered with the Bahria Foundation to establish Asia’s largest private housing society, Bahria Town. Despite an agreement to cease using naval nomenclature for his housing society, a case was filed against Riaz in 2002. Despite the setback, Riaz’s legal adviser has stated they will appeal the verdict.
