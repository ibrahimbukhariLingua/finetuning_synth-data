## History

It was in October 2007 that NetLogic Microsystems, Inc. signed a definitive agreement to acquire the privately held Aeluros, Inc., which created interface technologies and semiconductor products. In December 2010 NetLogic began using an implementation system developed by Magma Design Automation Inc, which created chip design software.

In 2011, NetLogic acquired Optichron for $22 million. From its IPO in 2004 through 2011, NetLogic grew at an annual rate of 39%, which was four to five times the average growth rate of semiconductor companies during that period. The company also enjoyed healthy profits, with gross profits in excess of 70% and net income in excess of 25% in 2011.

The Global Semiconductor Alliance named NetLogic the Most Respected Emerging Public Semiconductor Company for three consecutive years, from 2009 to 2011.

On September 12, 2011, Broadcom Corporation agreed to buy NetLogic for $3.7 billion in cash. It was a 57% premium to NetLogic's closing price on September 9, 2011. NetLogic shareholders received $50 a share. It was Broadcom’s largest acquisition and its first acquisition of a publicly-traded company. The acquisition closed in February 2012. According to the publication SlashGear, Broadcom hoped to boost its chipset division with the acquisition of NetLogic.

NetLogic was headquartered in Santa Clara, California, hired approximately 800 employees worldwide, and reported revenue of $405.4 million for its fiscal year 2012, its last fiscal year as a standalone company.
