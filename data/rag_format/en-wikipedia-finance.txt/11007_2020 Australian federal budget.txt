2020 Australian federal budget


# 2020 Australian federal budget



The **2020 Australian federal budget** was the federal budget to fund government services and operations for the 2020–21 financial year. The budget was presented to the House of Representatives by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on 6 October 2020. It is the seventh budget to be handed down by the Liberal/National Coalition since their election to government at the 2013 federal election, and the second budget to be handed down by Frydenberg and the Morrison government.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic recession, the budget was submitted five months later than the traditional annual date of the second Tuesday in May.


## Background

This budget shows Australia reported its largest budget deficit since the Second World War. The COVID-19 pandemic put a strain on Australia’s economy, and emergency measures were taken to keep Australians employed.

The 2020–21 budget, presented 5 months later than its traditional May date, will take this pandemic into account, especially for the Department of Home Affairs, with a COVID-19 response package. Regarding employment, a wage subsidy was introduced earlier in the year titled JobKeeper and JobSeeker, and a new hiring credit for employers in this budget called JobMaker.
