## Controversies


### Environmental damage

In 2009, the company was cited for violations in regard to spills of toxic hydraulic fracturing fluids in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

In 2012, the company was cited for improper well construction that had resulted in polluted drinking water.


### Restraining order on anti-fracking activist

In January 2014, the company sought, and a judge granted, a temporary injunction barring anti-fracking activist Vera Scroggins from entering on any of the 312.5 square miles of land in Pennsylvania owned or leased by the company. The company acknowledged that Scroggins had not violated any laws, but the lawsuit was due to her being a "nuisance" at company sites. In March 2014, the judge narrowed the injunction to prevent Scroggins only from going within 100 feet of an active well pad and 25 feet of an inactive well pad, access road or access road entrance.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
