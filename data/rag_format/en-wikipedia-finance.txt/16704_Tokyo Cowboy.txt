# Tokyo Cowboy



***Tokyo Cowboy*** is a 2023 comedy-drama film directed by Marc Marriott and written by Ayako Fujitani and Dave Boyle. An American and Japanese co-production, it follows Hideki, a Japanese businessman aiming to turn a Montana-based cattle ranch into a profitable asset for the Japanese beef company he works for.

The film stars Arata Iura in his American film debut.


## Plot

Japanese businessman Hideki takes over a chocolate company built by its owner, a grandfather with no grandchildren to inherit the company. With his job security in danger, he leaves for Montana, after convincing his boss and fiancée (Ayako Fujitani) that he can turn a struggling cattle ranch into a profitable business that produced wagyu beef.

In Montana, he meets ranch owner Peg (Robin Weigert) and ranch hand Javier (Gaya Robles). Due to cultural differences, he encounters difficulties with his original plan.


## Production

Development on the film was inspired by an American magazine article that director Marc Marriott came across upon his return to the United States from Japan, where he served as a filmmaking apprentice to Yoji Yamada. The magazine article covered a Japanese beef company which purchased a cattle ranch in Montana "to expand its operations". The company sent salarymen to the ranch in order to educate its staff on American cattle farming, as well as to introduce Americans to "the Japanese palate".

Arata Iura stars as Hideki, marking his American film debut. Filming took place in Tokyo and Montana. Filming in Montana primarily took place in Paradise Valley.
