## History

Brothers William M. Cafaro and John A. Cafaro began developing grocery stores for Kroger starting in 1942. In 1949, the Cafaro brothers formed the Cafaro Company. They began developing shopping centers, starting with a grocery plaza in Sharon, Pennsylvania. The two brothers managed the non-grocery tenants in the centers they developed.

In 1965, Cafaro opened its first regional shopping mall property, American Mall in Lima, Ohio. The company’s first regional mall projects were primarily localized to Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970, Cafaro opened the first enclosed mall in Iowa, Kennedy Mall in Dubuque. In 1988, Target Corporation asked the company to develop centers for the retailer in the Pacific Northwest, expanding the company portfolio to Washington and Oregon and resulting in the establishment of an office in Puyallup, Washington. William M. Cafaro died in April 1998.

The Cafaro Company divulged in portfolio diversification with projects such as the Eastwood Field baseball park and multi-function complexes such as the renovated Millcreek Mall and Spotsylvania Towne Centre in the 2000s. Anthony M. Cafaro, Sr., son of company founder William M. Cafaro, retired as president of the Cafaro Company in December 2009 and was succeeded by his sons Anthony Cafaro, Jr. and William A. Cafaro.
