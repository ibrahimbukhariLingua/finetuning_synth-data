## History


### Overview

Damen was established in 1927 in the town of Hardinxveld-Giessendam in the Netherlands by Jan and Marinus Damen. The two brothers ran a successful, mainly Dutch-oriented, shipyard for decades. Over the years they managed to build up a small, but loyal customer-base.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Damen Shipyards Hardinxveld, located about 10 km from the Damen Group headquarters in Gorinchem, still exists today. It is specialised in designing and building workboats, especially 'multi cats' and shoalbusters.

In 1969 Jan Damen's son, Kommer Damen, took over.


### World Bank Debarment

On March 16, 2016, the World Bank Group announced its debarment of Damen Shipyards Gorinchem for 18 months. As stated in a press release on the World Bank official website : *"The company engaged in a fraudulent practice under the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program"*

The sanction follows an agreement between the World Bank and Damen Shipyards Gorinchem hence a reduced debarment of 18 months, as stated : *"Damen has cooperated with the World Bank’s investigation and has taken remedial action, including strengthening its corporate compliance program"*
