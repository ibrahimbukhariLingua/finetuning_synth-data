Gerald Online


# Gerald Online



**Gerald Online** was an online jewellery retail store run in collaboration with Gerald Ratner and a Mumbai-based jewellery export company, SB&T International Ltd. Ratner partnered with an Indian jewellery manufacturer to import their jewellery into the UK.


## History

In 1984, founder Gerald Ratner inherited his family business, Ratners. About 10 years later, Ratners was one of the biggest jewellers in the world. However, due to several ill-advised jokes from Ratner during his 1991 speech to the Institute of Directors at the Royal Albert Hall, Ratners went into bankruptcy.

In 2003, after re-establishing Ratners under the new name of Signet Jewelers, Gerald Ratner founded online business Gerald Online in collaboration with SB&T, a Mumbai-based jewellery Export Company.

Gerald Online ceased trading in approximately 2014.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Operation

Gerald Online presented itself as selling jewellery directly from its factory, claiming that this resulted in lower prices.

Gerald Ratner and SB&T entered the Indian market under the name Gerald Online India.
