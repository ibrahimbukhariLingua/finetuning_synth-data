## Products

Splunk's core offering collects and analyzes high volumes of machine-generated data. It uses a lightweight agent to locally collect log messages from files, receives them via TCP or UDP syslog protocol on an open port (not preferred), or calls scripts to collect events from various application programming interfaces (APIs) to connect to applications and devices. It was developed for troubleshooting and monitoring distributed applications based on log messages.

Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) provides security information and event management (SIEM) for machine data generated from security technologies such as network, endpoints, access, malware, vulnerability, and identity information. It is a premium application that is licensed independently.

In 2011, Splunk released Splunk Storm, a cloud-based version of the core Splunk product. Splunk Storm offered a turnkey, managed, and hosted service for machine data. In 2013, Splunk announced that Splunk Storm would become a completely free service and expanded its cloud offering with Splunk Cloud. In 2015, Splunk shut down Splunk Storm.

In 2013, Splunk announced a product called Hunk: Splunk Analytics for Hadoop, which supports accessing, searching, and reporting on external data sets located in Hadoop from a Splunk interface.

In 2015, Splunk announced a Light version of the core Splunk product aimed at smaller IT environments and mid-sized enterprises. Splunk debuted Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) in September 2015. ITSI leverages Splunk data to provide visibility into IT performance. Software analytics can detect anomalies and determine their causes and the areas it affects.

Splunk *Security Orchestration, Automation and Response* (SOAR) free community edition, is free for as long as you want, up to 100 actions/day to automate tasks, orchestrate workflows, and reduce incident response times for cloud, on-premises or hybrid deployments.


### Cloud transformation

In 2016, Google announced its cloud platform would integrate with Splunk to expand in areas like IT ops, security, and compliance. The company also announced additional machine learning capabilities for several of its major product offerings, which are installed on top of the platform. Splunk Cloud received FedRAMP authorization from the General Services Administration FedRAMP Program Management Office at the moderate level in 2019, enabling Splunk to sell to the federal government. This allows customers to access Google's AI and ML services and power them with data from Splunk. Also, by integrating with Google Anthos and Google Cloud Security Command Center, Splunk data can be shared among different cloud-based applications. To help companies manage the shift to a multi cloud environment, Splunk launched its Observability Cloud, which combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, digital experience monitoring, log investigation, and incident response capabilities. In 2020, the company announced that Splunk Cloud is available on the Google Cloud Platform and launched an initiative with Amazon Web Services to help customers migrate on-premises Splunk workloads to Splunk Cloud on the AWS cloud.

In 2017, Splunk introduced Splunk Insights for ransomware, an analytics tool for assessing and investigating potential threats by ingesting event logs from multiple sources. The software is targeted toward smaller organizations like universities. The company also launched Splunk Insights for AWS Cloud Monitoring, a service to facilitate enterprises' migration to Amazon Web Services' cloud.

In 2018, Splunk introduced Splunk Industrial Asset Intelligence, which extracts information from IIoT(Industrial Internet of Things) data from various resources and presents its users with critical alerts.

In 2019, Splunk announced new capabilities to its platform, including the general availability of Data Fabric Search and Data Stream Processor. Data Fabric Search uses datasets across different data stores, including those that are not Splunk-based, into a single view. The required data structure is only created when a query is run.

Data Stream Processor is a real-time processing product that collects data from various sources and then distributes results to Splunk or other destinations. It allows role-based access to create alerts and reports based on data that is relevant for each individual. In 2020, it was updated to allow it to access, process, and route real-time data from multiple cloud services. Also, in 2019, Splunk rolled out Splunk Connected Experiences, which extends its data processing and analytics capabilities to augmented reality (AR), mobile devices, and mobile applications.

In 2020, Splunk announced Splunk Enterprise 8.1 and the Splunk Cloud edition. They include stream processing, machine learning, and multi-cloud capabilities.

In October 2019, Splunk announced the integration of its security tools - including security information and event management (SIEM), user behavior analytics (UBA), and security orchestration, automation, and response (Splunk Phantom) — into the new Splunk Mission Control.

In 2019, Splunk introduced an application performance monitoring (APM) platform, SignalFx Microservices APM, that pairs “no-sample’ monitoring and analysis features with Omnition's full-fidelity tracing capabilities. Splunk also announced that a capability called Kubernetes Navigator would be available through their product, SignalFx Infrastructure Monitoring.
