## History

Bentall Kennedy and GreenOak Real Estate merged to form BentallGreenOak in 2019.

Bentall Kennedy was a Canadian real estate investment firm that was a subsidiary of Sun Life Financial and GreenOak Real Estate was an American private equity real estate firm established in 2010 with its seed capital being provided by the Tetragon Financial Group.

In 2019, Sun Life Financial acquired a 56% stake in GreenOak Real Estate by paying $195 million in cash. Then Sun Life merged the two firms to form BentallGreenOak. Bentall Kennedy's CEO, Gary Whitelaw became CEO of the new entity.

In 2020, Whitelaw resigned from his position as CEO and was replaced by GreenOak Real Estate co-founders, Sonny Kalsi and John Carrafiell who are currently serving as co-CEOs.

In February 2023, it was reported that BGO has been building its US commercial real estate lending platform.

In September 2023, BGO introduced move-in-ready offices for SME tenants seeking flexibility in hybrid work arrangements.

In September 2024, BGO stated that while the commercial-property market had hit the bottom and would start to recover, the office sector would still have challenges due to a shift in tenant demand.
