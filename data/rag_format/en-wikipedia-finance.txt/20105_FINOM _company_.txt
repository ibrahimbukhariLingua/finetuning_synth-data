# FINOM (company)



**Finom** (Finom Payments B.V.) is a European financial technology company, neobank and electronic money institution (EMI) that offers banking and financial management services for businesses.


## History

It is headquartered in Amsterdam and was founded in the Netherlands in 2019 by four co-founders Andrey Petrov, Oleg Laguta, Konstantin Stiskin and Yakov Novikov. Prior to founding Finom, they launched a CIS-based neobank called Modulbank.

In 2020, it started providing e-invoicing services in Italy, and then expanded its services and new functionalities to other EU countries, such as Germany and France.

In 2020, as a start-up, Finom received a €6.5 million seed round from Target Global, with participation from General Catalyst.

During 2020 itself, Finom raised an additional €10.3 million, for a total of €16.8 million in capital. This amount was already secured prior to Finom's Series A financing round.

In 2021, Finom obtained its own EMI license granted by the central bank of the Netherlands, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), to operate throughout Europe while continuing to collaborate with partner banks Treezor (France) and Solaris (Germany, Italy).

In 2022, the company attracted €33 million in Series A financing from internal shareholders such as Target Global, Entrée Capital, Cogito Capital and General Catalyst.

In early 2024, Finom raised €50 million in a Series B funding round led by global top-tier investment firms General Catalyst and Northzone. As a result, Finom has raised more than €100 million since its inception.
