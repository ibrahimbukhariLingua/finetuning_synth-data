## Overview

Soriana was founded in 1968 by Mexican entrepreneurs and brothers, Francisco and Armando Martín Borque, in Torreón, Coahuila.

It operates supermarkets and department stores for consumer and wholesale markets.

Soriana competes primarily with H-E-B, La Comer, Chedraui, S-Mart and Walmex. Soriana emphasizes that it is Mexican-owned and operated.

It also had 14 distribution centers. In 2006, for reporting and administrative purposes, Soriana moved its headquarters from Torreón to Monterrey.


## History


### The Beginnings of La Soriana

The Soriana company has its origins in 1905, the year in which Don Pascual Borque (from Soria, Spain) founded a fabric business and perfumery under the name 'LA SORIANA' in Torreón, Coahuila, later incorporating in 1920, a wholesale merchandise offer, which with this became a benchmark in terms of purchases and consumption in Torreón.

In 1930, the brothers Armando and Francisco Martín Borque took over the management of the original business model, which began to expand in different municipalities of Coahuila, Durango, Chihuahua and Sonora. Years later, La Soriana changed its business model to retail.


### The beginnings of Soriana as a supermarket

In 1968 La Soriana abandoned its fabrics and perfumery sector and changed its business model to supermarkets, opening its first hypermarket (commercial center at the time) in downtown of Torreón, Coahuila, marking the official start of Soriana with the aforementioned business model, currently known as Organización Soriana, and with it the beginning of its permanent territorial expansion.

In 1974, Soriana began its first geographical expansion, with the inauguration of its first hypermarket in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey, Nuevo León, with the *Soriana Vallarta* store being the first branch in that city and therefore in the State of Nuevo León. Also in that same year, Soriana inaugurated its first hypermarkets in the States of Durango and Chihuahua with the branches of *Durango Centro* and *Chihuahua Centro* respectively, thus marking its first consolidation in any region of the country (in this case in the North of Mexico) and at its time turning Soriana into a regional supermarket chain. On October 30, 1975, Soriana arrived in the city of Gómez Palacio, Durango (belonging to the Comarca Lagunera) with the opening of its first shopping center in the city center (*Soriana Gómez Palacio Centro*), this being the first supermarket and the first national supermarket chain to be established in said city.


### The 80s

In the 1980s, Soriana continued with its expansion and consolidation in the north of the country, opening its first store in the border city of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua in 1984, as well as opening another branch in the city of Torreón, Coahuila, as is *Soriana Constitución*. Two years later, in 1986, Soriana arrived in another Mexican border city, Reynosa, Tamaulipas with its *Soriana Hidalgo* branch. Likewise, on September 30, 1987, Soriana began trading on the Mexican Stock Exchange under its ticker symbol SORIANA. At the end of the 1980s, the Martín Borque brothers had serious differences that led them to separate business, for which Don Francisco continued to lead Soriana with the company name "Tiendas de Descuento del Nazas" (Sorimex), and Don Armando traveled to the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico to later create the Hipermart store chain, which had the name "Sultana Discount Stores" (Organización Soriana), which in 1989 created the Hipermart store, which established its first stores under that name in Monterrey (*Cumbres* and *San Pedro*), Ciudad Juárez (*San Lorenzo*) and Torreón (*Independencia*).

As part of Sorimex, in 1988 Soriana began to venture into western Mexico, with Aguascalientes being the first city in that Mexican region to open its first Soriana store, known as *Aguascalientes Universidad*. A year later Soriana opens its first store in Zacatecas (*Soriana Zacatecas*).


### The 90s

In 1990, Soriana opened its first store in the Mexican Pacific in the State of Baja California (*Soriana Tijuana Plaza Carrousel*). However, due to an agreement with Casa Ley, said Tijuana branch was closed four years later, in which it was later replaced by Comercial Mexicana, which was ultimately acquired again by Soriana in 2015, which returned with its original name in 2017 with the conversion from Comercial Mexicana to Soriana Híper.

In 1994, the Martín Borque brothers joined forces again and merged both commercial chains (Soriana and Hipermart), leaving the company name as Centros Comerciales Soriana, and as it is currently called Tiendas Soriana. In that same year, Soriana enters the State of Jalisco for the first time with two stores opened, all of them located in the Guadalajara metropolitan area (*Soriana Bugambilias* in Zapopan -which began operations under its pseudonym *Hiperama* until mid-2016 when it was renamed to its original management Soriana Híper-, and *Soriana Río Nilo* in Guadalajara), as well as two stores in Guanajuato, in the cities of León (*Soriana Malecón*) and Irapuato (*Soriana Jacarandas*).

One year later, in 1995, Soriana continued its expansion plan with the opening of its first branch in the port of Tampico, Tamaulipas (*Soriana Ejército*). In 1997 Soriana began to venture into the center of the country in the State of Querétaro (*Soriana Quintana*), in which from 1998 onwards Soriana would reach more federal entities, such as San Luis Potosí in its *Soriana El Paseo* branch; Veracruz at its *Soriana Coatzacoalcos El Palmar* branch and Tlaxcala at its *Soriana Tlaxcala* branch. On May 1, 1998, Soriana opened its first store to the public in Ciudad Mante, south of the State of Tamaulipas, in which 350 million pesos were invested to carry out the opening. In December 1998 Mr. Francisco Martín Borque, founder and important promoter of the Soriana company, passed away.

In 1999, Soriana ventured into more regions of the country, reaching states such as Michoacán (*Soriana Uruapan*), Colima (*Soriana Plaza Colima*), Hidalgo (*Soriana Plaza del Valle Pachuca*), Puebla (*Soriana Torrecillas*), Tabasco (*Soriana Villahermosa Guayabal*, which ventures into the Mexican southeast for the first time) and Sinaloa (*Soriana Culiacán Zapata*), which the latter returns to the Mexican Pacific, this due to the breaking of the pact with Casa Ley of non-invasion of territories.


### 2000 - 2007


#### Opening of store #100 and incursion into new States of the Mexican Republic

But in December 2000, Soriana, entering the State of Nayarit for the first time, opened its 100th branch in the city of Tepic (*Soriana Cigarrera*), becoming the fourth self-service chain to operate a hundred establishments under the same name. commercial, behind Cifra-Walmart, Tiendas Gigante and Comercial Mexicana.

Subsequently, between 2001 and 2003, as part of its geographical expansion, Soriana ventured for the first time into the states of the Mexican southeast (Oaxaca in 2001; Yucatán and Chiapas in 2002 and Campeche and Quintana Roo in 2003) as well as in La Paz, Baja California Sur in 2002. In 2004, Fundación Soriana, A.C. was created as a company plan to strengthen and formalize corporate social responsibility programs.


#### Creation of new store formats: City Club, Mercado Soriana and Súper City convenience stores

On July 17, 2002, the price club, *City Club*, was created in Torreón, Coahuila, whose business model is responsible for serving families with high consumption as well as businesses through merchandise and products with wholesale sales volume and a half wholesale. In that same year, Soriana launched its loyalty card, known as La Tarjeta del Aprecio (Tarjeta Recompensas since 2015 and Tarjeta Recompensas Payback since 2018) with the aim of rewarding customers for their purchases, which were awarded points on the loyalty card, either to accumulate points, obtain free or discounted products or exclusive products.

One year later, in July 2003, the *Mercado Soriana* format was created, opening its first store of its kind in the municipality of Salamanca, Guanajuato, which consists of a medium-sized supermarket with a sales floor of between 3,500 and 5,000 m². With a low investment cost with competitive prices in all departments with a total of 25,000 products, in order to serve consumers located both in cities and towns of 50,000 to 150,000 inhabitants as well as in popular areas of large and medium-sized cities where it is not possible to locate a Soriana Híper, in which later, during 2003, Soriana began to open its first stores of the Mercado Soriana format in cities such as Navojoa and Guaymas (both in the State of Sonora) and the Metropolitan Area of Puebla (*Soriana Mercado Puebla Bosques*). From then on, Soriana began to include cities with fewer than 150,000 inhabitants and popular areas of large cities in its geographic expansion through the Mercado Soriana format, as well as expanding into new cities with its emblematic hypermarket and its price club City Club.

In 2005, in order to satisfy last-minute shopping needs as well as Soriana's goal of venturing into the convenience store business, the Super City format was created, whose objective is to compete against Oxxo and 7-Eleven at through operating under the franchise system as part of its expansion. Likewise, in that same year Carrefour withdrew from Mexico, and consequently, although most of its stores in the center, west, south and southeast of the country were sold to Chedraui and the Monterrey branch was acquired by Walmart, Soriana acquired the Carrefour stores in the states of Coahuila (*Saltillo Echeverría*), Chihuahua (*Chihuahua Saucito* and *Ciudad Juárez Alameda Iglesias*) and Sonora (*Hermosillo Bachoco*), making this the second acquisition of supermarkets by the Soriana company.


#### Soriana expansion in the center of the country; creation of a new supermarket format and the return of Soriana to the State of Baja California Norte

Also, Soriana began to enter the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico for the first time with the opening of *Mercado Soriana Ciudad Azteca*, in the municipality of Ecatepec, Estado de Mexico, which with this opening marked the bases for its consolidation in the center of Mexico being the year 2005 the most important for Soriana.

in April 2006, branch 200 of the commercial chain was opened, with the *Ciudad Frontera* branch (municipality belonging to the metropolitan area of Monclova, Coahuila). Likewise, on May 13, 2006, Soriana opens two new stores of its Soriana and City Club formats respectively within the *Plaza Centerario* shopping complex in the city of Gómez Palacio, Durango. Also in that year, a new supermarket concept was inaugurated in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco (*Soriana Súper Playa de Oro*, which was closed on May 1, 2020), this in turn with a provisional concept as a test that consists of a supermarket that offers consumers an agile and fast shopping experience through products from daily consumption. Likewise, and after 12 years of absence, Soriana returns to Baja California Norte with the *Calafia* and *Otay* store branches, in the cities of Mexicali and Tijuana respectively, in addition to opening its first hypermarkets in the State of Mexico with the *Ixtapaluca*, *Cofradías* (in the metropolitan area of Mexico City) and *Plaza Sendero Toluca* (in the metropolitan area of Toluca), this as part of its expansion plan in central Mexico. A year later, in 2007, Soriana opened its first store in Distrito Federal (today Mexico City) with the branch *Mercado Soriana Ermita*, as well as its first store in the State of Guerrero (*Mercado Soriana Iguala*), the municipality of Iguala de la Independencia was the first city to venture into the Guerrero market.


### 2007 - 2008


#### Third supermarket acquisition: Supermercados Gigante; the creation of the Soriana Súper format; foray into new cities and transition of Soriana now as a national supermarket chain

December 6, 2007, is one of the most significant dates for the company, since Soriana, with an amount of 1,350 million dollars, acquired from Grupo Gigante the 199 Gigante stores that operated Mexican territory under its Gigante, Bodega Gigante formats, Súper Gigante, Súper G and Súper Maz, as well as 7 in the United States in its Gigante USA format (which were later sold to Chedraui, who converted them into their El Súper format). With this purchase and acquisition, Soriana consolidates its presence nationwide and also meant another opportunity for the company to formally compete in the Distrito Federal market.

As of December 7, 2007 and until April 17, 2008, as part of the acquisition and merger of two companies, Gigante becomes a subsidiary of Soriana. At the beginning of 2008, due to said acquisition, the *Soriana Súper* format was officially created, which was created with the aim of offering quick purchases to the consumer and converting the Super G and Super Maz stores to this format, as well as some Gigante and Bodega Gigante branches, which had a sales floor of less than 3,500 square meters.

On April 18, 2008, the Gigante supermarket formats officially disappeared and all its stores, varying the size of the sales floor, were renamed to all the formats that Soriana handles (including the new Soriana Súper format). Likewise, Soriana began operations in the State of Morelos through the only former branch of Bodega Gigante in Cuernavaca, which was converted to Soriana Súper, which with said conversion and purchase of Tiendas Gigante, Soriana consolidates its presence in the 32 States of the Mexican Republic and, therefore, transcends to a national supermarket chain. Also, with the conversion of Tiendas Gigante to Soriana, the company was able to reach cities where Soriana did not previously have a presence but Gigante did (such as Ensenada and Tecate, both in Baja California Norte; Campeche, Campeche; Ciudad de Mexico; Silao and San Miguel de Allende, both in Guanajuato; Acapulco, Guerrero; Cuernavaca, Morelos - where it entered the State of Morelos for the first time through the conversion of Bodega Gigante to Soriana Súper-; Cozumel, Quintana Roo; Apizaco, Tlaxcala; and Valladolid, Yucatán), in addition to adding and even multiplying branches in cities where the company already had a presence.


### 2008-2014

After the purchase of 199 Gigante Stores and their conversion to the different company formats, as of April 18, 2008, Soriana became a national chain with its own hypermarket, supermarket, warehouse and price club formats, it began to compete and fight prices against other national chains, its main competitor being Walmart, which has a considerable presence in central Mexico. Two years later, as part of its permanent geographic expansion and its multi-format strategy, in February 2010 the *Soriana Express* format was created in the municipality of Centla, Tabasco, whose format consists of a supermarket with a sales floor from 800 to 1,500 square meters, which is mainly aimed at localities and small cities that are around 10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants or in areas of high population density in large and medium-sized cities, in which Soriana began from there to include in its expansion plan small cities or communities of 10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants with the *Soriana Express* format, among them the openings of its first stores of the Soriana Express format in the States of Nayarit (in the municipality of *Ixtlán del Río*) and Sinaloa (in the municipality of *El Rosario*) at the end of May 2010.

As part of its geographical expansion in 2011, Soriana expanded its Soriana Express format nationally, and with this opened its first store of its kind in the State of Zacatecas on February 9, 2011, this in the municipality of Jerez de García Salinas (*Soriana Express Jerez*, which has a sales floor of 1,294 m2 and 29 million pesos were invested for its construction). Later, on March 10, 2011 Soriana opens its first stores of the Soriana Express format in the State of Jalisco, starting with the municipalities of Tala (*Soriana Express Tala*) and Zapotiltic (*Soriana Express Zapotiltic*), in which Soriana later opens more stores of the Soriana Express format in several municipalities of Jalisco, such as Tlajomulco de Zúñiga (*Soriana Express Tlajomulco Centro* municipality belonging to the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area which opened on April 27, 2011); Sayula (*Soriana Express Sayula*, which was opened on May 4, 2011) and Ameca (*Soriana Express Ameca*, which was opened on August 25, 2011), likewise, on August 25 of the same year, Soriana opened its first Soriana Express store in the State of Morelos, this in the municipality of Yautepec de Zaragoza (*Soriana Express Yautepec*).

In September 2011, as part of its multi-format strategy, Soriana modified its organizational structure through the division of all its self-service formats for each market niche. Likewise, Soriana launches its new premium supermarket concept, known as *Soriana Super VIP*, with the Soriana Super Marne branch in the municipality of San Pedro Garza García (Metropolitan Area of Monterrey), Nuevo León being the first store with this previously remodeled and renovated gourmet concept , which has a sales floor surface of 2,230 square meters (M2), responsible for marketing a wide variety of national and imported products such as wines and liquors, delicatessen and prepared foods; where one can find dishes from different countries prepared by chefs. On October 7, 2011, Soriana opens new stores of the Soriana Express format in the States of Sinaloa (*Soriana Express El Dorado*, in the municipality of Culiacán, Sinaloa) and Sonora (*Soriana Express Nacozari*, in the municipality of Nacozari de García, Sonora)., and on December 9, 2011 Soriana opens its first stores of its emblematic Hypermarket format in the capital cities of the States of Guerrero and Quintana Roo, in the cities of Chilpancingo de los Bravo (*Soriana Híper Chilpancingo*) and Chetumal (*Soriana Híper Chetumal*) respectively , this as part of its expansion plan during 2011.

After both brothers died, Francisco's youngest son **Ricardo Martin Bringas**, took over as CEO and managing director, Martín Bringas had an estimated net worth of USD 2.1 billion in 2020. Under his leadership, Grupo Soriana grew to more than 600 stores in more than 200 cities and towns, and 14 distribution centers nationwide. In 2006, he moved the headquarters from the company’s original city of Torreon to Monterrey. In 1999 he and his wife founded Innovasport selling athletic footwear, apparel and sporting goods, and a sneaker-focused [spinoff chain, Innvictus. Together they have over 100 stores across Mexico. Ricardo was named *Expansión* magazine’s *100 Most Important Entrepreneurs in Mexico* in 2010.

In 2013, Soriana built its first wind power plant in the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, as part of the company's long-term Sustainability Plan. On April 24, 2014, Soriana opens its first store of its hypermarket format in the State of Morelos (*Soriana Híper Plaza Cedros Jiutepec*), this in the municipality of Jiutepec (municipality belonging to the metropolitan area of Cuernavaca), whose branch has a floor of sales of 5,843 m2 and an investment made of more than 101 million pesos in its construction. At the end of 2014, Soriana renewed its corporate image of both the organization and its different store formats, and with this the first store was opened with the change of image, in this case being the Soriana Súper San Agustín store, in the municipality of Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, Jalisco (belonging to the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area).


### 2015-2018


#### Purchase of the Comercial Mexicana Stores from Soriana

On January 28, 2015, and with a total amount of $39,194,000 MXN, Soriana acquired a large part of the 160 stores of Controladora Comercial Mexicana, along with the Comercial Mexicana, MEGA, Bodega Comercial Mexicana and Alprecio formats. , which would become subsidiaries of Soriana as of January 4, 2016.

In addition to purchasing Comercial Mexicana's supermarkets, Soriana also acquired other assets of high strategic value such as real estate assets corresponding to 118 stores, lease contracts with third parties corresponding to 42 stores, operating equipment and store inventory, also including the promotion of Julio Regalado, created in 1980 by Comercial Mexicana and which as of 2016 becomes part of Soriana. However, and during the purchase and sale process, only 143 branches were purchased, this due to the conditions of the COFECE (Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica in Mexico) which detected that of the 160 branches for sale, if said transaction were completed, it would affect 27 markets, reducing competition and, as a consequence, an increase in prices for consumers, which Soriana, by order of the COFECE, would not buy the branches and, instead disincorporate various stores located in the markets at risk of significantly affecting competition.

As a consequence of this condition, Comercial Mexicana kept 14 conditioned stores, while Soriana kept 13 to later be sold to third parties in the future, and with this the company was divided into two companies, that is, as of January 4 In 2016, the formats of Fresko, Sumesa, City Market and some units passed to Grupo LaComer, while the large formats such as Comercial Mexicana, MEGA, BODEGA and Alprecio, passed to the Soriana staff, which obtained the license to use of Comercial Mexicana brand for more than 2 years to later rename them to the formats managed by the company originally from Torreón, Coahuila.

Derived from the purchase of the Comercial Mexicana Stores and during the transition process, on June 3, 2016 Soriana relaunched the first Julio Regalado, whose summer promotion was shared by its already recently acquired Comercial Mexicana and its formats MEGA, BODEGA and ALPRECIO during the years 2016 and 2017. In this same year, on June 10, 2016, the Soriana Híper Plus format was created, which consists of a new gourmet hypermarket concept aimed at the medium and high socioeconomic level, which is responsible for offering the consumer, in addition to what they offer hypermarkets, high-value products and departments such as a cheese factory, wine and liquor cellars, European and artisanal breads, fine pastries and cuts of exotic meats, this with the opening of the Miyana branch in the Polanco neighborhood in Mexico City , which has a sales floor of 7,245 square meters. Likewise, in December 2016, and with an investment of 154 million pesos, the Soriana Híper San Pedro store was reopened in Monterrey, Nuevo León (which was originally Hipermart between 1989 and 1995), now with the already mentioned new concept of a premium hypermarket within a sales floor of 8,637 square meters, this being the second Soriana Híper Plus store within the Mexican territory.

However, during the purchase and sale process of Comercial Mexicana to Soriana, the company has had to close units as part of its adjustments, starting with the *Soriana Súper Plaza Fiesta* store in Matamoros, Tamaulipas (store previously part of Tiendas Gigante until 2008), which closed to the public definitively on February 16, 2017, whose closure was because in the same shopping plaza there was already another Soriana branch store (*Soriana Híper Matamoros Plaza Fiesta*), later being replaced in its space by a Del Sol department store. On March 7, 2017, the *Soriana Híper Tepeyac* branch store in Zapopan, Jalisco (municipality belonging to the Guadalajara metropolitan area) was permanently closed, whose store was also previously part of Tiendas Gigante until 2008, whose closure was due to low sales, this as a result of already having another Soriana store of the same format in its vicinity two blocks away (in that case *Soriana Híper Cordilleras*, which currently operates).

As of March 2017, Soriana gradually begins the conversion of Comercial Mexicana stores, starting in the State of Baja California, with the virtual conversion of 14 Comercial Mexicana stores to Soriana Híper, in which they were later converted to Soriana Híper the MEGA Comercial Mexicana branches of the States of Baja California Sur, Sonora and Sinaloa. Shortly after, Soriana created the *MEGA Soriana* format in Mexico City with the conversion of the Soriana Híper División del Norte branch (a branch that was previously part of Gigante) to MEGA Soriana, in addition to inaugurating two branches under said format (Patio Tollocan in Toulca, State of Mexico and Plaza Citadina in Villa Corregidora, Querétaro) as well as the initial conversion of 6 Comercial Mexicana stores, a MEGA Comercial Mexicana and a Bodega Comercial Mexicana to the then newly created MEGA Soriana. In November 2017, Soriana virtually converted another Comercial Mexicana store in the city of Zamora, Michoacán into Soriana Híper, which is now Soriana Híper Zamora Madero.

And to consummate the license of the Comercial Mexicana brand, as of March 1, 2018, Soriana converts the remaining branches of Comercial Mexicana into Soriana formats, the result of which was the following:

* **MEGA Soriana**: Which most of the Comercial Mexicana stores, all the MEGA Comercial Mexicana and some existing Bodega Comercial Mexicana in the Mexican Republic were converted to that format, this with the company's attempt to assimilate the change of the Comercial stores Mexican to Soriana.
* **Soriana Híper**: Some Comercial Mexicana and MEGA stores in the cities of León and Celaya (both in Guanajuato); Puerto Vallarta (Jalisco); Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos (also both in Veracruz) and Mérida (Yucatán) went directly to the main Soriana format.
* **Soriana Súper**: The Comercial Mexicana Acapulco Costa Azul and Comercial Mexicana Cancún Tulúm branches moved to this format because their sales floors in their respective branches were less than 3,500 square meters, in addition to being located in residential and hotel areas.
* **Soriana Mercado**: Initially, some Bodega Comercial Mexicana stores in Aguascalientes and Veracruz were converted to Soriana Mercado, as well as the Comercial Mexicana Texcoco Aeropuerto branch (State of Mexico), the latter because its sales floor was 4,900 square meters. The other Bodega Comercial Mexicana branches were temporarily converted to Bodega Soriana until December 31, 2018, due to the high recognition of the brand, which as of January 1, 2019, the branches with the name Bodega Soriana would go to the format Soriana Mercado.
* **Soriana Express**: The three Alprecio branches (Ojo de Agua, Lerma and Yautepec) were first converted to Bodega Soriana in 2018 and later moved to the Soriana Express format on January 1, 2019 with the official disappearance of the Bodega Soriana format.
* **CITY CLUB**: Between 2022 and 2023, the MEGA Comercial Mexicana branches of Ciudad Victoria (Tamaulipas) and Ciudad del Carmen (Campeche) were converted to City Club, this because their properties already had Soriana in their respective surroundings.
* **Sodimac Homecenter**: The MEGA Comercial Mexicana Jacarandas (Cuernavaca, Morelos) and MEGA Comercial Mexicana Boca del Río (Boca del Río, Veracruz) stores were changed to this format.

On May 31, 2018, after converting all store formats to Soriana, Controladora Comercial Mexicana officially disappeared, while the BODEGA Soriana format disappears on December 31, 2018, with a large part of its stores moving to the Soriana Mercado format; while 4 branches with the name BODEGA became MEGA Soriana and another 3 with that name went to the Soriana Express format, this because their stores are less than 1,500 M2 in addition to the fact that it was previously Alprecio Comercial Mexicana.


### 2018-Present


#### Openings and closings of Soriana stores and Sodimac Homecenter's incursion into the Mexican market

In mid-April 2016 and with an investment of 600 million dollars for its expansion, Soriana entered into a strategic alliance with the Chilean company Falabella, whose agreement contemplates the opening of home improvement establishments, under the name Sodimac Homecenter, as well as financial services with the CMR credit card, and with this, in August 2018, the first Sodimac Homecenter store was inaugurated to the Mexican public in the municipality of Cuautitlán Izcalli, State of Mexico, this within the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, whose first store focused on home improvement has a sales floor of 10,700 square meters (M2), in which later, more Sodimac Homecenter stores would begin to open throughout the country, such as Arboledas in Naucalpan; Cuernavaca, Morelos (the first store in the interior of the Mexican Republic, which enters said city to replace a MEGA Comercial Mexicana store); Boca del Río, Veracruz (the first in the Mexican southeast, and like Cuernavaca, also replacing MEGA Comercial Mexicana Boca del Río); Plaza San Mateo in Naucalpan and San Luis Potosí, SLP (In the El Paseo shopping center).

On May 20, 2021, Sodimac opens its seventh store in the country in the city of León, Guanajuato, replacing City Club, which closed on February 29, 2020 due to low sales as a result of the lack of interest from the León public in aforementioned Soriana price club. At the end of August 2021, Sodimac Homecenter enters the metropolitan area of Monterrey for the first time, and with this opens its first branch in Sendero Monterrey, being the eighth branch in the Mexican Republic. Three months later, on December 3, 2021, the ninth Sodimac store in the country opens to the public and, at the same time, the second branch in Monterrey and its metropolitan area, this in the municipality of Santa Catarina, Nuevo León.

On June 16, 2022, Sodimac Homecenter opens its tenth branch in Mexican territory, entering Mexico City for the first time, which opens its first store in the Plaza Central shopping center, whose store is a format with a smaller sales floor, with an area of more than 4,000 m2. Later, at the end of 2022, Sodimac opened branches in the city of Saltillo, Coahulia in the Soriana Echeverría shopping plaza, which at the same time accompanies Soriana Híper and City Club within said shopping complex and in Mexico City as part of the Gran Sur Shopping Center, which at the same time is the first Sodimac Homecenter store in Mexico City in its traditional format. On July 27, 2023, Sodimac opens its thirteenth store in the Mexican territory with the Interlomas branch, this in the municipality of Huixquilucan, State of Mexico (also part of the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico), which has a surface sales area of 5,081 square meters with a merchandise level of 30,000 products.

On the part of Soriana, after having fully completed the purchase of Comercial Mexicana and converting all its stores to Soriana, since 2019 the company has made several adjustments in its control of its more than 800 branches in Mexican territory, and since 2020, As a result of the purchase of Comercial Mexicana, Soriana has had several difficulties in consolidating at a national level, which the company had to face because its newly acquired stores were close to its formats that it already controlled in which adjustments began to be made within the company, and as a result, they began to open and close stores due to cannibalization in their different store formats; due to inventory shortages in some units; due to the strong competition from supermarkets in the center of the country and the subsequent poor reception by consumers.

As a consequence of this adjustment, during 2019-2020 Soriana has closed several branches in the Mexican territory, these closures are due either to comply with the COFECE conditions of the sale of some Soriana units after purchasing the Comercial Mexicana units in 2015, for reporting low sales in their units, for the fact that they already have another Soriana store in their vicinity or for remodeling or reconstruction from scratch to be reopened later, starting with the *Soriana Híper Iglesias* branch store in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, which temporarily closed its branch on February 2, 2020 due to the construction of the Alameda Iglesias shopping center in the previously demolished property, reopening to the public on May 17, 2023 now under the name of *Soriana Súper Alameda Iglesias*. Likewise, on February 29, 2020, due to low sales as a result of low public interest, the only City Club in León, Guanajuato, was closed to the public, being replaced a year later by Sodimac Homecenter.

## Criticisms and controversies


### Mexico's 2012 Presidential Elections Soriana gift cards vote buy

At a news conference, the leftist candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador claimed that the election was "plagued with irregularities" and accused the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of allegedly buying votes in favor of Enrique Peña Nieto. He also claims that the PRI handed out gifts to lure voters to cast their vote in favor of them. During the day of the 2012 presidential elections, people who voted for el PRI would receive pre-paid gift cards. Nonetheless, the PRI and the store denied such accusation and threatened to sue López Obrador. Peña Nieto vowed to imprison anyone – including members of the PRI – if they are found guilty of electoral fraud. Despite Enrique's statement many videos by citizens about the Soriana cards surfaced on YouTube.
