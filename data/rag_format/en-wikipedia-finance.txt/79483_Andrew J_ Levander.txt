He graduated in 1977 from Columbia Law School, where he was a Kent Scholar and the Notes and Comments Editor of the Columbia Law Review. After completing law school, he clerked for the Honorable Wilfred Feinberg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.


## Later career

In the late 1970s, Levander was an assistant to the Solicitor General, and made his first argument before the U.S. Supreme Court at age 25. He later served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York's Securities and Commodities Fraud Unit.

Upon leaving the U.S. Attorney's office in 1985, Levander joined New York-based firm Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman & Goodman, where his clients included fund managers David Askin and John Kaweske, former Sunbeam Corporation chairman Paul Kazarian, Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and Haroon Kahlon, an associate of National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia chairman Sheik Khalid-Bin-Mahfouz who was implicated in the BCCI scandal. Levander continued at Shereff Friedman through that firm's 1998 merger with D.C.-based Swidler & Berlin to form Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman until joining Dechert with a group of 64 other Swidler lawyers in 2005.

In July 2011, Levander became Chairman of Dechert, then a 900-lawyer firm.

Levander obtained a dismissal of the federal class action in September 2011 and negotiated a settlement with the Attorney General's office in 2012. He also successfully resolved numerous investor claims and in June 2018 he settled the claims with the Madoff Trustee for a net settlement payment to the Merkin funds of $280 million.

He was hired in January 2011 by Hewlett Packard's board of directors to conduct an independent investigation into the departure of CEO Mark Hurd in response to a shareholder lawsuit challenging the payment of up to $53 million in severance to Hurd despite reports that he violated the company's conduct standards. A subsequent derivative lawsuit attacking the independence and thoroughness of that investigation was summarily dismissed in September 2012.

Beginning in 2008 through 2015, Levander represented the Board of Directors of Lehman Brothers in several securities actions, ERISA class actions, and other related litigation arising from the bank's 2008 bankruptcy.

Subsequently, Levander obtained a dismissal of a class action regarding Barclaysâ€™ trading operations as to Diamond.
