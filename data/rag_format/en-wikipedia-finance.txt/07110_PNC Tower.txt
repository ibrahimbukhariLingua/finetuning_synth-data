PNC Tower


# PNC Tower



**PNC Tower** is a skyscraper in Downtown Louisville, Kentucky, and located at 101 South Fifth Street. It was completed in 1972 and was originally named **First National Tower**.


## Naming

The building, originally named First National Tower, was named after First National Bank and renamed National City Tower in 1994 when First National Bank was acquired by National City Bank. The building was renamed PNC Tower in 2017.


## Height and construction

Completed in 1972, the 40-story, 512-foot (156 m) high structure was designed by architects Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz based on the timeless designs of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. This is the only building in Louisville that Harrison & Abramovitz designed, although the firm designed more than 15 buildings in New York, including the Socony–Mobil Building and the Axa Equitable Center.
PNC Tower was the tallest building in the state of Kentucky from 1972 until 400 West Market was completed in 1993. The tower is constructed of steel columns on concrete piles of caissons with an anodized aluminum and glass curtain wall. The Annex, constructed of reinforced concrete, houses the garage, retail space on the grade level and office space on the top level.

In February 2010, the National City logos on east and west sides of the tower were replaced with PNC Bank logos, due to PNC's takeover of National City Bank.


## Lease and management

The building is currently leased by Jones Lang LaSalle. and managed by Cushman & Wakefield and owned by DB Oak Barrel LLC. Tenants include Humana Inc., PNC Bank, the Louisville branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Bingham Greenebaum Doll PLLC, Dinsmore & Shohl LLP and Fultz Maddox Dickens PLC.
