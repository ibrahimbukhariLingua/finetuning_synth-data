## History

In 1952, NV Trust Corporation Pierson, Heldring & Pierson was incorporated in Curaçao by Pierson, Heldring & Pierson. In 1975, AMRO Bank acquired Pierson, Heldring & Pierson and ABN Bank acquired Mees & Hope Bankers. After the merger of ABN Bank and AMRO bank into ABN AMRO in 1991, Pierson, Heldring & Pierson and Mees & Hope Bank were merged into MeesPierson in 1993. The trust and corporate management services activities were branded as MeesPierson Trust.

In 1997, MeesPierson was acquired by Fortis. In 2002, MeesPierson acquired Holland Intertrust Corporation and rebranded as MeesPierson Intertrust. The company adopted its owner's name in 2006 and rebranded as Fortis Intertrust.

In June 2009, Fortis Intertrust was rebranded as Intertrust. It was sold to Dutch investor, Rob Thielen's, Waterland Private Equity Investments for a reported price of either €210 million or €250 million.
