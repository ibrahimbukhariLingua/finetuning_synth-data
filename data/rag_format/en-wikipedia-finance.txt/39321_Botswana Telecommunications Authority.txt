Botswana Telecommunications Authority


# Botswana Telecommunications Authority



**Botswana Telecommunications Authority** (**BTA**) is a dissolved independent commission that was responsible for regulating all matters related to telecommunications (wire, cellular, satellite and cable), postal services of Botswana and has been succeeded by Botswana Communications Regulatory Authority. The Minister appoints all five board members, who serve on a part-time basis. The BTA is mandated to promote the development and provision of efficient telecommunications and broadcasting services in Botswana, under the terms of the Telecommunications Act 15 of 1996. There have been legal disputes between the BTA and licensed operators, springing from issues related to interconnection and pricing.


## History

Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) was established in 1980 to provide, develop, operate and manage Botswana's national and international telecommunications services. The Botswana government holds 100 percent equity in the BTC.
Botswana's history of sector reform dates to 1980, when the BTC was created through the Botswana Telecommunications Act. The act established the BTC as a monopoly of telecommunications services and separated it from Posts (which continued to operate as a government department).

Following public concerns regarding unsatisfactory telecommunications services during the 1990s (including lack of competition in providing services, limited private-sector participation, lack of transparency in decision-making and lack of a platform for consumer complaints), the government began public consultations to liberalise the telecommunications market.
In 1992 the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications was tasked with policy transformation.
The consultations culminated in the approval of the 1995 Telecommunications Policy for Botswana: the blueprint for restructuring the telecommunications sector, which embodied principles which guided the form of the government monopoly.
The transformation process led to the formation of the BTA under the Telecommunications Act 1996, as passed in the National Assembly on 1 August 1996.


## Structure and functions

The board, as established by section four of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, is responsible for the overall strategic direction of the BTA and not involved in itsdaily management. It oversees the functions and approves policy and regulations. The board also approves the annual budget and additional expenditures not included in the annual budget.

## Highlights and controversies


### Legal disputes

The BTA was involved in the following cases:

* 1999: The BTA resolved its first interconnection dispute between the Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) and the two major cellular operators in Botswana, Mascom Wireless and Vista Cellular in BTA Ruling No. 1 of 1999. The directive was the agreement of interconnect rates between the providers; the no-charge directive for emergency services, and the agreement of wholesale charges for leased lines.
* 2000: In December 2000, the BTA ordered the BTC to make leased lines available equally to private ISPs and Botsnet. In March, after the BTA threatened a lawsuit, the BTC agreed to provide the leased lines. A similar dispute involving USKO and the BTC was also resolved in 2000.
* 2003: Following a deadlock, Mascom Wireless and Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) jointly signed a declaration of interconnection dispute dated 5 July 2002. The dispute was submitted to the Botswana Telecommunications Authority (BTA) for determination. The legal principle for determining interconnection charges is the "fair and reasonable" test. Interconnection charges may be deemed to be fair and reasonable if they approximate costs, or if they are based on efficiency criteria.
* 2007: Court ruling in dispute between Botswana Telecommunication Authority and Orange. The High Court of Appeal of Botswana has ruled that the Botswana Telecommunications Authority (BTA) should no longer receive tax revenues from mobile phone operators from the sale of scratch cards and free airtime offered by the mobile operators to their customers.
