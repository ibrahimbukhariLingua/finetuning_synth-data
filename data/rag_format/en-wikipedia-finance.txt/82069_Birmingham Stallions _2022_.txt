# Birmingham Stallions (2022)



The **Birmingham Stallions** are a professional American football team based in Birmingham, Alabama. The Stallions compete in the United Football League (UFL) as a member of the USFL Conference. They were a founding member of the second iteration of the United States Football League (USFL) in 2022. The Stallions are owned and operated by Dwayne Johnson's Alpha Acquico and Fox Corporation, and play their home games at Protective Stadium. They have won three league championships since their founding, defeating the Philadelphia Stars 33–30 in 2022 and the Pittsburgh Maulers 28–12 in 2023 as part of the USFL, and most recently the San Antonio Brahmas 25–0 in the inaugural UFL Championship Game in 2024 achieving the elusive "3-Peat" and cementing dynasty status.


## History

The Birmingham Stallions were one of eight teams officially announced as a USFL franchise on *The Herd with Colin Cowherd* on November 22, 2021. On January 6, 2022, it was revealed that former NCAA coach Gene Chizik would become the head coach of the Stallions. Chizik confirmed the report, but the parties have yet to agree. He ultimately took a deal to become the defensive coordinator for North Carolina two days later. On January 20, 2022, it was announced on *The Herd with Colin Cowherd* that former NCAA football head coach Skip Holtz was named the head coach and general manager of the Stallions.

The Stallions finished the 2022 regular season with a 9–1 record, winning the South division title and clinching the South division's first seed. The Stallions hosted their first South Division Championship game, facing the second-seed New Orleans Breakers. The Stallions defeated the Breakers 31–17 and advanced to the 2022 USFL Championship Game.

On July 3, 2022, in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio, the Stallions played against the North division's second seed, the Philadelphia Stars. Following halftime, the Stallions led by eleven points, but a 4-yard Stars' touchdown narrowed the Stallions' lead to five points with 5:17 remaining in the third quarter. On the Stallions' next possession, they were forced to attempt a 38-yard field goal, which was missed. Then Philadelphia's Case Cookus found Devin Gray in the end zone for a touchdown two plays later. The Stars attempted and converted a two-point conversion. This gave Philadelphia a 23–20 lead, their first of the game. Following a pair of field goals and a 26–23 lead with under three minutes remaining, Scooby Wright had a 46-yard interception returned for a touchdown to seal the game for the Stallions effectively. Victor Bolden Jr. won the USFL Championship Game Most Valuable Player Award.

Following the 2022 season, the Stallions hired Zachary Potter. He previously held the title of team director during the Stallions 2022 season.

In September 2023, *Axios* reported that the XFL was in advanced talks with the USFL to merge the two leagues prior to the start of their 2024 seasons. Officials in Birmingham were assured that the Stallions would be part of the merged league should the union go forward. On September 28, 2023, the XFL and USFL announced their intent to merge with details surrounding the merger to be announced at a later date. The merger would also require regulatory approval. In October 2023 the XFL filed a trademark application for the name *"United Football League"*. On November 30, 2023, Garcia announced via her Instagram page that the leagues had received regulatory approval for the merger and were finalizing plans for a "combined season" to begin March 30, 2024. The merger was made official on December 31, 2023.


## Traditions

The Birmingham Stallions has an official supporters group, The Horsemen, as well as the newly inaugurated Shirtless Stallions. Both groups are often recognized by the coaches and players.


### The Horsemen

The Horsemen became the official fan base of the Birmingham Stallions at the beginning of the 2023 season. Stationed in Section 104 of Protective Stadium, The Horsemen are directly behind the home team's benches, allowing easy access and interaction with the players, coaches, and cheerleaders. The supporters group has been the creators of the many chants made during the games--"Giddy Up" and "Buck 'Em"—as well as crowning its team the "Kings of Spring," after the Stallions continues to win League Championships, and hands out crowns to all of the fans.

Many of The Horsemen travel to all of the away games, including the League Championship games; whereas, others remain in Birmingham to host watch parties that has attracted many fans as well as coverage from local media.

The Horsemen work with the team to create unique fan experiences, such as watch parties, signings, meet-and-greets, as well as working with the team to shop for and donate toys to the Children's of Alabama Hospital Sugar Plum Shop each year.

The local media often utilize The Horsemen as the spokespeople for the fan base, ensuring all fans are informed of local events and updates on the season. Coach Skip Holtz often refers to The Horsemen and how the fan base creates an electric environment at both home and away games and how much he appreciates the fans.

For the 2023 National Championship, The Horsemen led the team and cheerleaders in the parade.


### Shirtless Stallions

On April 20, 2024 the Stallions hosted a game against the D.C. Defenders at Protective Stadium in Birmingham, AL. With 1:55 remaining in the first half, the game was halted for a lightning delay. By the time play resumed nearly 90 minutes later, most fans had left the stadium. However of the few devoted fans who remained, a group of men had gathered near the North endzone, taking off their wet shirts and cheering enthusiastically. Having received such significant air time in the game broadcast, a tradition was born. Later dubbed the "Shirtless Stallions", during each home game at the front row of Section 138 a small group of shirtless fans begins to gather. By the end of most games the Shirtless Stallions has typically grown to include several dozen fans as well as the Stallions' mascot, Stanley.


## Championships

The Stallions have won two USFL Championships and one UFL Championship as well as two (USFL) South Division Championships and one (UFL) USFL Conference Championship, winning three championships in a row from 2022 to 2024.
