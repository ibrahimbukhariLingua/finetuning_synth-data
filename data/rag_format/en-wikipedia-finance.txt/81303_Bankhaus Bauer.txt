## History

The business was founded in 1931 as a limited partnership business entity by banker Richard Bauer under the name Bankhaus Bauer KG in Stuttgart. During World War II the business offices were destroyed in a bomb attack. At short notice the headquarter was moved to Schwäbisch Gmünd in 1944. After the war finished the headquarter was moved back to Stuttgart in 1945. In 1986 the business was converted into the joint-stock company *Bankhaus Bauer AG*.

In 1992 the Schuppli-Gruppe in Wiesbaden, the *Hypothekenbank in Essen AG* and the *Hypothekenbank in Berlin AG* joined the business. The shares of the Schuppli-Gruppe and the *Hypothekenbank in Berlin AG* were taken over by the Commerzbank AG in 1994, which then became majority shareholder of the *Bankhaus Bauer AG*. In 2001 the Schuppli-Gruppe, which also owned the *Düsseldorf Hypothekenbank AG*, again purchased the majority of the bank. Under executive board spokesman Wolfgang Kuhn the banks investment volume between 1997 and 2006 was increased to more than 700 million Euros. In May 2006 Kuhn left the *Bankhaus Bauer AG* at his own request.

In the light of the new Mortgage Bond Act the Schuppli-Gruppe merged its two subsidiaries *Düsseldorfer Hypothekenbank AG* and *Bankhaus Bauer AG* in 2006. The *Bankhaus Bauer AG* was added to *Düsseldorfer Hypothekenbank AG* and operated as its non-independent branch.
