# Robert S. Tucker



**Robert S. Tucker** (born March 16, 1970) is an American businessman and philanthropist who is currently serving as the 35th Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department. He was chairman and CEO of T&M USA, a security and investigative services company based in New York City. He is the grandson of American operatic tenor Richard Tucker.

Tucker was appointed FDNY fire commissioner by New York City Mayor Eric Adams on August 12, 2024. Barely a month later it was revealed that Tucker had a prior business relationship with Chinese billionaire and convicted scammer Miles Guo. Guo has been linked to FBI counterintelligence investigations as recently as 2023. It was also revealed that Tucker helped Lin Gui’an obtain a job as a civilian aide in the NYPD despite Lin’s ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Adams’ ties to Chinese-American businesspeople and government officials in New York City are reportedly under investigation by federal prosecutors.

Six weeks before Tucker was appointed FDNY commissioner eight employees of Tucker’s former business made political contributions to Adams on the same day.

Tucker has never been a firefighter or emergency response official. He is a self-described “fire buff” who cites his time as a young boy chasing fire engines as inspiration for his service.
