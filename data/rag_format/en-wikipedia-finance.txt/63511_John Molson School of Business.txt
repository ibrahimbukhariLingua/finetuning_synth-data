## Name origin

The John Molson School of Business is named after businessman John Molson who was an entrepreneur in Canada during the late 18th century and early 19th century after having emigrated from England. Shortly after his arrival, at the age of 23, he founded the Molson Brewing Company, which is North America's oldest brewery.

Concordia University renamed its Faculty of Commerce and Administration after John Molson in November 2000 following a $20 million donation by the Molson family towards the construction of the new John Molson Building.
