## History

Ent was chartered in 1957 to serve military and civilian personnel assigned to Ent Air Force Base (now the United States Olympic Training Center) and Peterson Field (now Peterson Space Force Base) in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ent and Ent Air Force Base were both named for Major General Uzal Girard Ent, commander of the Ninth Air Force during World War II. Ent Air Force Base opened in 1951 when the United States Air Defense Command moved to Colorado Springs.

Ent's community charter change, to serve El Paso and Teller counties in Colorado was approved by the National Credit Union Administration in 1999.

Ent's charter was adjusted in 2004 to include underserved areas in Denver County and Pueblo County.

Ent changed from a federal to a state of Colorado credit union charter on January 1, 2016. In April, its charter was expanded to include Arapahoe, Douglas, Fremont and Jefferson counties.

Ent's charter was expanded in October 2018 to include Adams, Boulder, Broomfield, Elbert, Larimer and Weld counties.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
