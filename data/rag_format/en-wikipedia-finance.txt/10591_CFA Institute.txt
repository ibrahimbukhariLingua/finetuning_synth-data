## History

In 1947, four financial analyst societies—Boston, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia — cooperated for the purpose of promoting the exchange of ideas and supporting the welfare of their profession, calling the new group the National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (NFFAS). In 1959, the NFFAS Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts (ICFA), which was incorporated in 1962. NFFAS changed its name to the Financial Analysts Federation (FAF) in 1961.

In 1962, the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation and code of conduct were established. In 1963, the profession was formalized when 284 candidates sat for the first CFA exam and 268 CFA charters were awarded. The following year, all 3 levels of the exam were administered to more than 1,700 candidates.

The Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR) was founded in 1990 as the umbrella organization for the ICFA and the FAF, still separate entities at that time. ICFA and the FAF consolidated under AIMR in 1999.

In 2004, the Association for Investment Management and Research voted to change its name to the CFA Institute.

In February 2019, The United States Department of Justice announced it will fine CFA Institute more than $320,000 for discriminating against qualified American workers by hiring temporary foreign workers through the H-1B visa program.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, CFA Institute cancelled the majority of the 2020 examinations around the world due to the lack of examination facilities. From 2021 onwards, all examinations were shifted to computer-based testing for the three levels of the CFA program.

In March 2021, CFA Institute launched the Certificate in ESG Investing due to the high profile of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors in socially responsible investing.
