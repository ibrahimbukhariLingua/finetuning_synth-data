# MazaCoin



**MazaCoin** (Maza, MZC) is a cryptocurrency launched in 2014.


## History

MazaCoin was developed by Payu Harris in 2014. MazaCoin was specifically designed for the Oglala Lakota tribe in South Dakota. Some Native Americans adopted the use of MazaCoin to battle the US Government.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In October 2017, a *Mashable* article on the Oglala Lakota included a video about Harris's efforts to get MazaCoin accepted.


## Recognition and use

The currency was adopted by the Lakota Nation in 2014, with half of its supply reserved by the tribe to minimize the price volatility common in cryptocurrencies.

In 2017, The Lakota leadership formally recognized MazaCoin as their national currency, yet this decision encountered skepticism within the community. The concept of digital currencies, heavily reliant on technology such as apps and smartphones, was less accessible to older generations and those without consistent internet access. To counteract this, a system of paper wallets was developed, allowing MazaCoin to be stored and used in a more traditional, physical format. This system allowed tribal members to use MazaCoin in physical form for transactions within the community, converting it back to digital format at the centralized facility.
