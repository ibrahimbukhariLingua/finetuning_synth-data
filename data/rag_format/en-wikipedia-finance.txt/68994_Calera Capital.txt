## History

Calera Capital was founded in 1991 as a partnership between investment professionals and the Fremont Group, a private investment company based in San Francisco. Calera Capital's initial pool of funds was provided by the Fremont Group. Calera Capital raised its first institutional fund, Fremont Partners II, in 1996 with a diverse group of investors. Fremont Partners III was raised in 2001 further expanding the firm's investor base.

Prior to 2007, Calera Capital was known as Fremont Partners, a name the firm derived from the Fremont Group. The name change to Calera Capital occurred as the firm began raising its fourth fund, Calera Capital Partners IV, and reflected the firm's transition to an entirely independent entity owned by the investment professionals and no longer affiliated with the Fremont Group.

Calera is currently investing out of its fifth fund, Calera Capital Partners V, a $555 million fund targeting investments in companies valued between $100 million and $750 million.
