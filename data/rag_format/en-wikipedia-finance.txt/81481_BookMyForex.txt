He introduced forex services for the first time at the Bank of Punjab and later headed the foreign exchange departments at Centurion Bank of Punjab, HDFC Bank, and ING Vysya Bank. BookMyForex launched an online foreign exchange marketplace where licensed brick-and-mortar foreign exchange dealers could bid for customer orders within their geographic area. The company claims it was a pioneer in foreign exchange services such as foreign currency bank notes, prepaid forex cards, and international money transfers in India. In 2016, it received funding from Faering Capital. In 2016, a partnership was formed with MakeMyTrip to integrate forex services into MakeMyTrip's platform.

In August 2019, the company entered the travel industry with the launch of a Multi-Currency Forex Travel Card in collaboration with Yes Bank, and it also formed a partnership with Go First (formerly GoAir). By April 2022, MakeMyTrip's fintech arm, TripMoney, had acquired a majority stake in BookMyForex. In 2024, the company launched its first currency exchange app.
