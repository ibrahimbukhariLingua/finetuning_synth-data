Valmeyer, Illinois


# Valmeyer, Illinois



**Valmeyer** is a village in Monroe County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,233 at the 2020 census. It was originally located in the American Bottom floodplain of the Mississippi River but now occupies higher land to the east.


## History

After the Great Flood of 1993 the residents of Valmeyer decided to relocate the town 2 miles (3 km) to the east, on land that is more than 300 feet (91 m) higher than the floodplain. The town was rebuilt with financial assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The old townsite has been described as a ghost town with few inhabitants but still an important traffic artery. Valmeyer's successful relocation is seen as a potential model for other localities retreating from sea level rise.
