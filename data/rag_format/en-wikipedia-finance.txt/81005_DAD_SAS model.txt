DAD–SAS model


# DAD–SAS model



The **DAD–SAS model** is a macroeconomic model based on the AD-AS model but that looks at the different incomes at different inflation levels.


## DAD curve

The DAD (Dynamic aggregate demand) curve is in the long run a horizontal line called the EAD (Equilibrium aggregate Demand) curve.
The short run DAD curve at flexible exchange rates is given by the equation:

{\displaystyle \pi =\mu -bY+bY\_{-1}+h(\Delta i^{W}+\Delta \epsilon ^{e})}

The short run DAD curve at fixed exchange rates is given by the equation:

{\displaystyle \pi =\epsilon +\pi ^{W}-bY+bY\_{-1}+\gamma \Delta Y^{W}+\delta \Delta G-f(\Delta i^{W}+\Delta \epsilon ^{e})}


## SAS curve

The SAS (Surprise aggregate supply) curve is in the long run a vertical line called the EAS (Equilibrium aggregate Supply) curve.
The short run SAS curve is given by the equation:

{\displaystyle \pi =\pi ^{e}+\lambda (Y-Y\*)}
