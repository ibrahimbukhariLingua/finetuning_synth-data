In 1988, at the MIPCOM, Buena Vista International Television said that they were planning on to develop up to five pay international cable channels on its own, none of them were materialized.

## History


### Capital Cities/ABC Video Enterprises

**Capital Cities/ABC Video Enterprises** (CAVE) was incorporated on January 27, 1987. as an ancillary production, video and distribution company owned by Capital Cities/ABC. In 1992, CAVE launched Capital Cities/ABC Video Publishing as its subsidiary to release videotapes under the ABC Video label. In December 1992, CAVE realigned its upper management by adding a president position to Capital Cities/ABC Video Productions for overseas control of its production units Ultra Entertainment, the Hemisphere Group and Capital Cities/ABC Video Productions and bringing in Archie C. Purvis to fill the position. Joseph Y. Abrams was promoted to replace Purvis as president of ABC Distribution Co. Both have reported to president of CAVE International, John T. Healy.

On July 25, 1993, CAVE and DIC Animation City formed a production joint venture called DIC Entertainment L.P., to provide material for CAVE to distribute in the international market.


### ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group

In early October 1993, CAVE became part of the newly formed **ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group** (ACIBG), moving out of the broadcasting group to directly report to the CEO of CC/ABC, with Herb Granath continuing as president. The group continued oversiting its stakes in cable companies ESPN, A&E and Lifetime, international program sales, co-production and interests in foreign program services Eurosport, Germany's RTL-2, Japan Sport Network and animation company DIC. On October 12, Ambroco Media Group, Inc. was formed under Purvis to work with foreign partners for the development and production of programs. On October 21, Capital Cities/ABC Video Enterprises changed its legal name to Capital Cities/ABC Cable and International Broadcasting, Inc., then on December 15, it changed once again to **ABC Cable and International Broadcast, Inc.** In January 1994, ABC Network announced Purvis' retirement and the closure of Ambroco's operations.


### Disney–ABC International Television

When the Disney-CC/ABC merger led Disney Television and Telecommunications to be split up in April 1996, Walt Disney Television International was transferred to Capital Cities/ABC. CC/ABC combined the international units, Walt Disney Television International and ACIBG, into Disney–ABC International Television (DAIT) in July 1996. On October 19, 1999, ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group was renamed **Disney–ABC International Television, Inc.** By February 1999, DAIT began operating under the Buena Vista International Television name.

On May 14, 2007, Buena Vista International Television was renamed Disney–ABC International Television, due to Disney semi-retiring the Buena Vista name. In April 2008, the Asia Pacific office renewed its multi-year movie agreement with Zee Studio, an Indian basic-cable movie channel. In October 2015, at Mipcom in Cannes, Disney Media Distribution France extended its film and TV agreement with Canal Plus Group, adding first-run rights to films including those from Lucasfilm and SVOD rights for CanalPlay, which is effective in January 2016.

With the March 14, 2018, strategic reorganization in anticipation of integrating 21st Century Fox's assets, Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International was formed with distribution units being moved over from Disney-ABC Television Group. In July 2019, Marinelli announced her resignation, ending a 34-year long tenure with the company. Janice Marinelli, president of global content sales and distribution, would report to Mayer. Disney announced it would combine all the company's media sales and channel distribution into one organization. ESPN's executive vice president Justin Connolly was promoted to the newly created role of president of media distribution, reporting to Mayer. With a leadership change in this new segment in May 2020, the media distribution group was moved to Disney Media Networks.


### Disney Platform Distribution, Inc.

On October 12, 2020, Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced a strategic reorganization that created a new division of the company, Media and Entertainment Distribution, that is being led by Kareem Daniel. Under the new structure, Disney created a group responsible for both the dissemination and ad sales for all of its content, including across streaming services including Disney+. Effectively, that makes Disney Platform Distribution responsible for Disney–ABC Domestic Television, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.

In February 2023, the reinstated Disney CEO Bob Iger restructured the company, restoring theatrical distribution and Disney Music Group back to Walt Disney Studios chairman. The rest of Disney Platform Distribution would serve as a shared service for both Disney Entertainment and ESPN.
