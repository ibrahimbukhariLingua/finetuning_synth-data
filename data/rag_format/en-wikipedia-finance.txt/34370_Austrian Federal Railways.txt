Austrian Federal Railways


# Austrian Federal Railways



The **Austrian Federal Railways** (German: *Österreichische Bundesbahnen* [ˌøːstəʁaɪçɪʃə ˈbʊndəsˌbaːnən], formally ***Österreichische Bundesbahnen-Holding Aktiengesellschaft*** or ***ÖBB-Holding AG*** (lit. 'Austrian Federal Railways Holding Stock Company') and formerly the *Bundesbahnen Österreich* [ˈbʊndəsˌbaːnən ˈøːstəʁaɪç] or ***BBÖ*** [beːbeːˈʔøː]), now commonly known as **ÖBB** ([øːbeːˈbeː]), is the national railway company of Austria, and the administrator of Liechtenstein's railways. The ÖBB group is owned entirely by the Republic of Austria, and is divided into several separate businesses that manage the infrastructure and operate passenger and freight services.

The Austrian Federal Railways has had two discrete periods of existence. It was first formed in 1923, using the *Bundesbahn Österreich* name, as a successor to the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways (kkStB), but was incorporated into the *Deutsche Reichsbahn* during the 1938–1945 Anschluss. It was reformed in 1947, under the slightly different name *Österreichische Bundesbahnen*, and remains in existence in this form.

Major changes currently being made to the Austrian railway network are the construction of the Koralm Railway, the Semmering Base Tunnel and the Brenner Base Tunnel connection with Italy.

Eurobarometer surveys conducted in 2018 showed that satisfaction levels of Austrian rail passengers are among the highest in the European Union when it comes to punctuality, reliability and frequency of trains. Furthermore, with their *Nightjet* brand, ÖBB operates Europe's largest night train fleet.

Unlike other major railway companies in Europe that offer more flexible cancellation policies, ÖBB only offers two types of tickets: full-price tickets, and cheaper but non-exchangeable and non-refundable tickets.


## History

* 1882 – Gradual nationalisation of the railway network of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways (*Kaiserlich-königliche österreichische Staatsbahnen*, kkStB). By the outbreak of the World War I, the only major railway in Austria to remain in private hands was the Austrian Southern Railway (*Südbahn*).
* 1918 – After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following the World War I, the Austrian rump of kkStB remained in state control under the name *Deutschösterreichische Staatsbahnen* (DÖStB), which was renamed the *Österreichische Staatsbahnen* (ÖStB) in 1919.
* 1923 – Foundation of the independent, commercial enterprise, the *Bundesbahn Österreich* (which used the abbreviation BBÖ, because ÖBB was already taken by the Swiss *Oensingen-Balsthal-Bahn [de]*). This company took over the assets of the ÖStB and the *Südbahn*, together with other minor railways.
* 1938 – The Anschluss of Austria into the Third Reich. The BBÖ was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. During World War II about 41% of the Austrian railway network was destroyed.
* 1947 – The company was reformed using the slightly different name of *Österreichische Bundesbahnen* and the abbreviation ÖBB (by that time the Swiss private railway used the abbreviation SP for its goods wagons in international traffic, so its abbreviation ÖBB could now be appropriated) as a state-owned company. Their infrastructure was rebuilt and electrification was accelerated.
* 1969 – A new federal railway law was enacted. The ÖBB became a non-independent, economic entity, that was run as a branch of the government's industrial programme and remained entirely within the Federal budget.
* 1992 – The ÖBB were broken out of the federal budget and turned into company with its own legal status (a cross between a *GmbH* and an *AG* in Austrian commercial terms). The company is 100% owned by the Republic of Austria. This change had two primary aims: 1. It had to conform to EU rules on the admission of Austria into the European Union. 2. The financial demand on the public purse was to be reduced as a result of improvements in efficiency and the pressure of competition.
* 2004 – The ÖBB were reorganised into ÖBB Holding AG and a number of operating subsidiaries. The holding company was to oversee the operations of the companies assigned to it, coordinate a coherent strategic approach and allocate tasks for the whole enterprise.
* 1 January 2005 – The subsidiaries of ÖBB-Holding AG became autonomous and independent operationally.
* In 2012, ÖBB celebrated the 175th anniversary of the *Nordbahn*, the earliest predecessor company marking the start of rail transport in Austria. ÖBB CEO Christian Kern inaugurated an exhibition on the company's collaboration with Nazi Germany, named "The Suppressed Years – Railway and National Socialism in Austria 1938–1945". He referred to that period as "the darkest chapter of our company history," adding that the company must accept this period as part of its legacy. The exhibition later went on tour and was presented at the European Parliament's parliamentary building in Brussels.

The Austrian rail system is largely electrified. Electrification of the system began in 1912 but did not reach an advanced state until the 1950s. The last steam locomotive in regular service on the standard gauge network was retired in 1978.

The post-war laws related to the Austrian railways were the:

* *Eisenbahngesetz* (EisbG 1957),
* *Schieneninfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesetz* (SCHIG 1999),
* *Eisenbahnhochleistungsstreckengesetz* (HIG 1999) and
* *Bundesbahngesetz* (1992).
