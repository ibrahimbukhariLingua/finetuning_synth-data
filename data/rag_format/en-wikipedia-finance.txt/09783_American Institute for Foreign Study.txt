## History

In 1964, Cyril Taylor and his partners left Procter & Gamble to form the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS). With the assistance of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1967, AIFS created the AIFS Foundation, which awards grants and scholarships to students for participation in study abroad programs and provides grants to high schools and other institutions for the purpose of international and educational travel. The AIFS Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) tax exempt public charity and a U.S. Department of State designated sponsor of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa. In 1972, AIFS established Richmond, The American International University in London, a non-profit university with 1,000 full-time students from 100 countries.

Sir Cyril continued to serve as AIFS Chairman and Chancellor of Richmond, the American International University in London, until his death at age 82.
