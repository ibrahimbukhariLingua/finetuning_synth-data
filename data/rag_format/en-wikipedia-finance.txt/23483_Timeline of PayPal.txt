Timeline of PayPal


# Timeline of PayPal

 

This is a timeline of online money transfer and e-commerce service PayPal, owned by eBay from 2002 to 2015 and an independent company before and after that.


## Big picture

| Time period | Key developments at PayPal |
| --- | --- |
| January 1999 – March 2000 | The two companies, Confinity and X.com, that will eventually merge to become PayPal, launch separately and build competing financial products. The first iteration of the PayPal product is released by Confinity in later 1999. |
| March 2000 – July 2002 | Confinity and X.com merge. The combined entity, initially called X.com, later changes its name to PayPal. PayPal adopts eBay as a key platform to grow its userbase, because of the need for an online payment system on eBay. eBay responds with its own payment service, Billpoint. PayPal competes fiercely with Billpoint, raises a large amount of money, and IPOs in February 2002. |
| October 2002 – mid-2010 | PayPal is acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in eBay stock. The product and userbase grow steadily, faster than the parent company eBay. |
| mid-2010 – September 2014 | PayPal moves aggressively into new territory, including micropayments, mobile payments, in-store payments, international expansion, and more tools for small and medium businesses. It debuts new hardware and collaborates with brick and mortar stores for its in-store payments options. It acquires competitor startup Braintree, a payments gateway company. |
| September 2014 | It is announced that PayPal will be split off eBay. |
| July 2015 onward | The spinoff from eBay is completed on July 20, 2015, with the company trading independently under the ticker "PYPL" on the NASDAQ. |


## Full timeline

| Year | Month and date | Event type | Event |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1998 | December | Company launch | Confinity, the company that would later launch the first version of PayPal, is founded by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek, Yu Pan, Ken Howery, and Russel Simmons. The company idea is due to Max Levchin, and Thiel is initially interested only in being an investor, but Levchin convinces Thiel to become CEO of the company. |
| 1999 | January | Company launch | X.com, the company that would later merge with Confinity to become PayPal, is launched by Elon Musk. |
| 1999 | July | Product launch | Confinity announces the launch of online payment service PayPal, intended to be usable via a web browser and via a Palm Pilot. At the launch party in July, Nokia Ventures uses PayPal to send $3 million in venture capital investment on-stage. |
| 1999 | September | Product launch | The product is launched to the public. |
| 1999 | November | Product launch | Confinity launches a fully functional PayPal website and the staff send emails to their friends offering $1 for signing up. |
| 1999 | December | Product launch | Financial services company X.com, headed by chairman Elon Musk and CEO Bill Harris, adds online payment to its online account service, and makes it their product focus. |
| 1999–2000 | December–February | Customer focus shift | Confinity identifies eBay as a promising area to acquire users, because of the high concentration of buyers and sellers and the absence of any standard payment system for them to use. |
| 2000 | March 1 | Competition | EBay announces Billpoint, its in-house payment service, in collaboration with Wells Fargo. This could pose a serious threat to PayPal, because eBay auctions are a major source of user acquisition for it. |
| 2000 | February (discussions), March 2 (announcement) | Merger | Confinity and X.com merge, and the new entity is officially called X.com. Bill Harris remains CEO of the new entity, while Elon Musk remains chairman. The top tier at Confinity receive vice-presidential titles at the new company. |
| 2000 | April | Leadership change | Bill Harris is ousted from the CEO role. Musk takes over the role of CEO and Thiel becomes chairman. The reason for Harris' departure appears to be his inability to handle the scaling issues posed by PayPal's rapid growth, as well as his continued focus on unproductive approaches such as striking deals with small and unreliable startups. |
| 2000 | June | Product | PayPal introduces paid accounts for buyers and sellers that require verification and offer guarantees against fraud. |
| 2000 | October | Leadership change | Elon Musk steps down as CEO and Peter Thiel takes over as interim CEO. Musk continues to stay on the board of directors. |
| 2000 | October | Product | The company closes X.com's financial services in order to focus on the online payment system. The company also decisively switches away from the X.com brand, even though its official name continues to be X.com. |
| 2000–2001 | Mid-2000 through all of 2001 | Product | Max Levchin spearheads efforts to reduce fraud. This would prove to be one of PayPal's decisive sources of advantage, as the costs of fraud had constrained its ability to offer affordable services. Innovations include one of the web's first commercial implementations of CAPTCHA (in the form of the Gausebeck-Levchin test) and a program called "Igor" that identified and froze online activity that appeared fraudulent. |
| 2002 | February 15 | Company IPO | PayPal has its initial public offering. The offering is for 5.4 million shares at a share price of $13 (determined the previous evening by Salomon Smith Barney, their investment bank), for a total of $70 million. The valuation of the company is about $800 million. On the launch date, the price of the shares peaks to $22 and closes at $20. |
