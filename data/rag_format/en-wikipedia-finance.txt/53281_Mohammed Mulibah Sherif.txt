## TRANSCO CLSG

In January, 2006, Members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) established articles of agreement establishing a new West African Power Pool (WAPP) organization. The objective of the WAPP is to establish a regional electricity market in West Africa through the development of key priority infrastructures that will permit accessibility to economic energy resources, to all member states of the ECOWAS. The Côte d'Ivoire – Liberia – Sierra Leone – Guinea Interconnection Project is one of the major sub-programs of the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP), with the aim to integrate the four post conflict countries into the same regional electricity market; by a high capacity transmission interconnection from Côte d'Ivoire to Guinea through Sierra Leone and Liberia. Supply of adequate and reliable electric power supply will improve security, good governance, the development of industry as well as improve the quality life of local communities.

Cote 'd'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are part of what many consider a flagship electricity project that could pay off handsomely for Sub-Saharan Africa - and spark an economic transformation for countries struggling to stay afloat. Andrew M Herscowitz, the Coordinator for US President Barack Obama's Power Africa and Trade Africa initiatives has said that investment in energy infrastructure in Africa will help unlock potential in what is already the world's fastest-growing continent, with positive results for global growth.

The CLSG's line is a 1,303 kilometer stretch, coming from Man to Danane; from Danane to Yekepa; from Yekepa to Buchanan; from Buchanan to Mount Coffee; from Mount Coffee to Bo Waterside, which provides huge opportunities for Liberia. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), through its West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) has made regional power grid access a priority for the next decade. Thus, the establishment of TRANSCO CLSG has created burgeoning opportunities across the region.

The WAPP intends to integrate the various national power systems into a unified regional electricity market - with the expectation that such mechanism would, over the medium to long-term, assure the citizens of ECOWAS member states a stable and reliable electricity supply at affordable costs, facilitating the balanced development of diverse energy resources for their collective economic benefit, through long-term energy sector cooperation, unimpeded energy transit and increasing cross-border electricity trade.
