## History


### 1959-2019

The company was founded in 1959. In 1987, British and Commonwealth Holdings acquired Mercantile House and gained control of OppenheimerFunds. OppenheimerFunds was acquired by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1990 for $150 million.

Bill Glavin was CEO of the company from 2009 to 2014. He also served as chair. Arthur Steinmetz became president in 2013, CEO in July 2014, and chairman in 2015, simultaneously serving in all three roles.

In July 2012, OppenheimerFunds acquired SteelPath, enabling clients to invest in master limited partnerships. The firm acquired RevenueShares in 2015 to expand its offerings into the smart beta space. In 2016 it launched a suite of smart beta exchange-traded funds, including environmental, social and corporate governance offerings.

In 2017, it acquired SNW Asset Management, expanding its fixed income offerings into high-quality municipal bonds and customized separately managed accounts. The firm opened its headquarters for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in London in October 2017. Also in October 2017, the firm formed a joint venture with The Carlyle Group to provide global private credit for high-net-worth individuals and advisors primarily focused on the U.S. market.

### 2019-2024

As of February 28, 2019, the company managed over $260 billion in assets in over 13,000,000 investor accounts. On May 24, 2019, Invesco acquired the company for about $5 billion.
