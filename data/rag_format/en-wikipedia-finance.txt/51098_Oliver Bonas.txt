## History

In 1993, Oliver Tress, aged 25, opened the first Oliver Bonas store on Fulham Road in west London. He initially sourced products from trade shows around the country. On its first Saturday trading, the shop made £1,000 worth of sales.

The chain was named after Tress's then-girlfriend, Anna Bonas, the cousin of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.

In June 2020, the chain secured £3.5 million of additional funding from HSBC as part of the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.

As of July 2023, Oliver Bonas has 1,500 employees and 83 shops across the UK and Ireland. Revenues were £92.8 million in the 2021 financial year and pre-tax profits came in at £7.5 million.
