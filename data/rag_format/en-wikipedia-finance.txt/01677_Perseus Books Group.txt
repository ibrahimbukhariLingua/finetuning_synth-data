Perseus Books Group


# Perseus Books Group



**Perseus Books Group** was an American publishing company founded in year 1996 by investor Frank Pearl. Perseus acquired the trade publishing division of Addison-Wesley (including the Merloyd Lawrence imprint) in 1997.

In 2005, Perseus acquired Client Distribution Services, the former distribution arm of Random House. It was named Publisher of the Year in 2007 by *Publishers Weekly* magazine for its role in taking on publishers formerly distributed by the Publishers Group West and acquiring Avalon Publishing Group.
In January 2007, the Perseus Books Group purchased Avalon Publishing Group, the parent company of Carroll & Graf and Thunder's Mouth Press; the purchaser folded both imprints and stopped publishing books under those names in May 2007.

In 2014, following the bankruptcy auction of Good Books assets, Skyhorse Publishing sold the Mayo Clinic line to Perseus. It was then incorporated and released through Perseus' Da Capo Lifelong imprint.

After the death of Frank Pearl, Perseus was sold to Centre Lane Partners in 2015, a private equity firm. In April 2016, its name and publishing business was acquired by Hachette Book Group and its distribution business by Ingram Content Group.

In December 2018, Hachette Books became an imprint of the Perseus Books division. Concurrently, Da Capo Press and Da Capo's Lifelong became part of Hachette.
