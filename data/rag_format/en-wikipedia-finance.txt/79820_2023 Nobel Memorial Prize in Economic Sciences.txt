2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences


# 2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences



The **2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences** was awarded to the American economist Claudia Goldin (born 1946) "for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes." At age 77, she became the third woman to have won the economics Nobel, which was first awarded in 1969, and the first woman to win the award solo. The pressed release of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted:

> "This year’s Laureate in the Economic Sciences, Claudia Goldin, provided the first comprehensive account of women’s earnings and labour market participation through the centuries. Her research reveals the causes of change, as well as the main sources of the remaining gender gap."

Goldin's key contribution to economics was her vast analysis of historical experience of women in the economy, especially on women's work and labor market outcomes as well as the root causes of the gender pay gap.


## Laureate

Goldin studied economics at Cornell University, where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1967, and the University of Chicago, where she graduated with a master's and a doctorate in 1969 and 1972, respectively. At the University of Wisconsin, Princeton University, Harvard University, and the University of Pennsylvania, among other universities, she served as a professor or lecturer of economics. She was named Henry Lee Professor of Economics and Lee and Ezpeleta Professor of Arts and Sciences at Harvard after becoming the first woman to be appointed to a tenure-track economics professorship in 1990. In addition, Goldin was president of the Economic History Association, director of the National Bureau of Economic Research's (NBER) Development of the American Economy Program, and president of the American Economic Association, and co-director of the NBER's Gender in the Economy working group.
