## Career


### Early years

In 1991, Gurinov started his business in export-import operations and consumer goods trade. Together with his partners, he created the DealMakers company and a retail chain of denim stores selling clothes of the Turkish brand Colin's [uk]. In 1998, the business was sold.

In 1996, Gurinov was one of the founders of Petrosoyuz [ru] (formerly Petroimport), which produced grocery food. In 1999, he became the company's deputy CEO. In 2003, he sold his share in business to Heinz.

Under his management, in 2002, the company became one of the leaders in confectionery production in Russia. Lyubimiy Kray had 450 employees. Gurinov sold his stake in the company in 2013. In 2001, Petrosoyuz's and Lyubimiy Kray's turnover increased to over $250 million.


### Cordiant

From 2003 to 2011, Gurinov was the CEO of Sibur's subsidiary, Sibur-Russian Tyres. Prior to his appointment, Sibur's tyre business was unprofitable, and its organization was fragmented. Vadim Gurinov united these disparate business units under one holding company, bringing it to profit in 2006.

At the end of 2011, Gurinov reached an agreement with Sibur that Sibur-Russian Tyres's top managers and third-party investors would buy out the company. In December 2011, the deal was finalized, and Gurinov became the owner of the controlling stake of 80%. After that, Sibur-Russian Tyres was renamed into Cordiant, and Gurinov was appointed the company's Chairman of the board of directors. In addition, he proposed a development strategy that allowed the company to expand significantly. As a result, in 2021, Cordiant became the second largest player in the market.

In 2017, Gurinov transferred his shares in Cordiant to his wife, Galina Gurinova. Consequently, she became the company's controlling shareholder, and the company was considered a family asset.

A 100% stake in Cordiant was sold to S8 Capital Group in May 2023.

Thus, Service-Telecom took 21% of the tower infrastructure market in Russia.
