# Exclusive economic zone of Greece



Greece has claimed an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with a total size of 505,572 km² (195,202 sq mi), which is the 53rd largest in the world.


## Geography

Greece forms the southernmost part of the Balkan peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea. It includes many small islands which vary between 1,200 and 6,000 in the Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea. The largest islands are Crete, Euboea, Lesbos, Rhodes and Chios.

Greece's EEZ is bordered to the west by Albania and Italy, to the south by Libya and Egypt, and to the east by Cyprus and Turkey.

## Agreements and disputes

According to published maps, the Government of Israel has recognized the EEZ of Greece and Cyprus. They describe the course of the gas pipeline which will transfer gas produced by American Νoble Εnergy Ltd. from the Leviathan reservoir to Europe, through an undersea pipeline crossing Greece. By this proposal, Israel recognizes the Greek EEZ in the area and offers an advantage that Greece can use during negotiation procedures to support its claims on the area. In practice, this cooperation will set up a powerful energy coalition between Greece, Cyprus and Israel. The mining and operating part will be undertaken by an American company. "The substance of the issue is that in an effort to protect and secure vital Israeli interests in the Mediterranean Sea, Israel has been left with no choice other than to officially delimit its maritime borders".

On 8 June 2020, Greece signed an agreement with Italy, establishing an EEZ between the two countries and resolving longstanding issues over fishing rights in the Ionian Sea.

On 6 August 2020, Greece signed an agreement with Egypt designating an EEZ in the Eastern Mediterranean between the two countries.
Both agreements are in line with Greece's claimed EEZ as per UNCLOS 1982 as well as customary international law.

In October 2020, Greece and Albania agreed to refer their EEZ boundary delimitation to the International Court.

Of the remaining neighbouring countries, Greece is yet to sign EEZ boundary agreements with Cyprus, Turkey and Libya. Turkey doesn't recognize a legal continental shelf and EEZ around the Greek islands.
