## History

Zerodha was founded in August 2010 by brothers Nithin and Nikhil Kamath. The name Zerodha, indicates a combination of words for the company's ideals: *zero* and *rodha*, the Sanskrit word for 'barrier'.

In June 2020, Zerodha became a "unicorn" with a self-assigned valuation of around $1 billion based on an ESOP buyback. Zerodha had about 1.3 million customers in early 2020, which rose to nearly 10 million by the end of 2022.

In 2020, Zerodha applied for a licence to set up an AMC mutual fund in India and launched its fund house in 2023.

## Technical problems and interruptions

There have been multiple reports of technical issues including glitches, system outages and connectivity issues on Zerodha's Kite platform, especially on days with high market volatility and F&O expiry days.

In November 2020, Livemint reported that some Zerodha traders complained of being unable to access its Kite platform due to a technical issue. Several users took to Twitter to report a login issue. Zerodha, in an official statement, acknowledged the problem.
