## History

Fifth Wall was formed in 2016 and announced the close of its $212 million real estate technology fund (Fund I) in May 2017. Wallace said that the firm identified real estate technology as an underserved investment niche because the industry has traditionally used very little technology and was therefore open to disruption.

In July 2019, the firm announced the close of its second real estate technology fund, or Fund II, which closed at $503 million. While Fund I was raised from nine investors in the US only; Fund II consisted of a global investor base from over 50 investors from 11 countries. The fund's investors included CBRE Group, Cushman & Wakefield, Equity Residential, Gecina, Merlin Properties, Mitsubishi Estate, British Land, Prologis and Segro. Fund II invested in a number of companies, but was focused on business-to-business enterprises such as the California-based Cobalt Robotics.

As of February 2020, the firm managed over $1.1 billion in assets. In 2021, Fifth Wall announced that it had raised more than $1.1 billion across its funds and had a global investor base of over 90 investors. In addition, several large real estate investors announced their investments into the firm's Climate Tech Fund, including Equity Residential, Hudson Pacific Properties, Invitation Homes, and Ivanho√© Cambridge. "Real estate is kind of this massive industry when it comes to climate change, but at the same time we haven't seen the industry commit a significant amount of capital to the tech that's required to decarbonize it," Wallace said.

In 2022, Fifth Wall announced its inaugural "Climate Tech Fund," a sustainability venture fund investing in technologies that would decarbonize the real estate industry, which drives an estimated 39% of global emissions. The fund is focused on technologies related to energy efficiency, water reuse, decarbonization, climate resilience and risk management. The firm closed its climate fund with $500 million in commitments to invest in companies which decarbonize the real estate industry. This fund brought the firm's assets under management to over $3.2 billion. The firm's limited partners include Camden Property Trust, Hilton, Host Hotels & Resorts, Marriott, Koch Industries, Starwood Capital Group, Lowe's and MGM Resorts International.
