Self-service


# Self-service



**Self-sourcing** is a term describing informal and often unpaid labor that benefits the owner of the facility where it is done by replacing paid labor with unpaid labor.

**Selfsourcing** (without a dash) is a subset thereof, and refers to developing computer software intended for use by the person doing the development.

Both situations have aspects of *Self-service*, and where permitted involve benefits to the person doing the work, such as job & personal satisfaction, even though tradeoffs are frequently involved, including long term losses to the company.


## Doing someone else's job

When a loan officer is asked to "self-source" they are taking on a responsibility that is not one of the top seven "Loan Officer Job Duties" listed by a major job placement service.

A situation where no payment is madeᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ is self-service, such as airport check-in kiosks and checkout machines. International borders have also experimented with traveler-assisted fingerprint verification.


## History of self-sourcing

An early use of the term is a 2005 HRO Today article titled "Insourcing, Outsourcing? How about Self-sourcing?" that mined Wikipedia's history of a pair of banks that merged decades ago as Standard Chartered and, after September 11, rebuilt its personnel department in an innovative way.

The concept is similar to self-service, and one USA example is pumping gas: New Jersey banned customers from doing this in 1949; now NJ is the only state "where drivers are not allowed to pump their own gasoline."


### Self-service

In 1994 it was considered a radical change to propose permitting self-service at the gas pumps, in Japan, and the New York Times reported that "the push .. (came) from Japanese big business ... trying to cut costs."

Automatic Teller Machines are another example, and their expansion beyond banks have led
to signs saying **A**ccess **T**o **M**oney, which refers to a company with that name; the technology began over half-a-century ago.


## Selfsourcing

**Selfsourcing** is the internal development and support of IT systems by knowledge workers with minimal contribution from IT specialists, and has been described as essentially outsourcing development effort to the end user. At times they use in-house Data warehouse systems, which often run on mainframes.

Various terms have been used to describe end user self service, when someone who is not a professional programmer programs, codes, scripts, writes macros, and in other ways uses a computer in a user-directed data processing accomplishment, such as End user computing and End user development.
In the 1990s, Windows versions of mainframe packages were already available.


### Data sourcing

When desktop personal computers became nearly as widely distributed as having a work phone, in companies having a data processing department, the PC was often unlinked to the corporate mainframe, and data was keyed in from printouts. Software was for do-it-yourself/selfsourcing, including spreadsheets, programs written in DOS-BASIC or, somewhat later, dBASE. Use of spreadsheets, the most popular End-user development tool, was estimated in 2005 to done by 13 million American employees.

Some data became siloed Once terminal emulation arrived, more data was available, and it was more current. Techniques such as Screen scraping and FTP reduced rekeying. Mainframe products such as FOCUS were ported to the PC, and business intelligence (BI) software became more widespread.

Companies large enough to have mainframes and use BI, having departments with analysts and other specialists, have people doing this work full-time. Selfsourcing, in such situations, is taking people away from their main job (such as designing ads, creating surveys, planning advertising campaigns); pairs of people, one from an analysis group and another from a "user" group, is the way the company wants to operate. Selfsourcing is not viewed as an improvement.

*Data warehouse* was an earlier term in this space.


### Issues

It is crucial for the system's purposes and goals to be aligned with that of the organizational goals. Developing a system that contradicts organizational goals will most likely lead to a reduction in sales and customer retention. As well, due to the large amount of time it may take for development, it is important allocate your time efficiently as time is valuable.

Knowledge workers must also determine what kind of external support they will require. In-house IT specialists can be a valuable commodity and are often included in the planning process.

It is important to document how the system works, to ensure that if the developing knowledge workers move on others can use it and even attempt to make needed updates.


### Advantages

Knowledge workers are often exactly aware of their immediate needs, and can avoid formalizations and time needed for project cost/benefit analysis and delays due to *chargebacks* or need for managerial/supervisory signoffs.

Additional benefits are:


### Disadvantages


#### Inadequate expertise

Some knowledge workers involved in selfsourcing do not have experience or expertise with IT tools, resulting in:


#### Shadow IT

Although departmental computing has decades of history, one-person-show situations either suffer from inability to interact with a helpdesk or fail to benefit from wheels already invented.


## Self-service tools

**Self-service tools** are offered to professionals as well as laymen. Among the basic examples of various categories are:

* simple office equipment - even in a "paperless office" individual office workers use scotch tape dispensers, staplers and staple-removers. The *New York Times* mentions their applicability to *Home Office* businesses.
* hand-operated tools - screwdrivers, pliers, wrenches, hammers, handsaws
* mechanized/power hand-held tools - power drill, power saw
* software tools - the individual parts of office suites represent areas of functionality used for knowledge management, both in finding stored information and in entering new content. Versions of these exist both for locally stored (desktop computer) programs and internet/cloud-based.
 + Human resource departments offer employee self-service, including providing employees with tools for skill building and career planning.
* self-service kiosks - interactive kiosks have become common in industries like QSR, transportation, hospitality, healthcare, cannabis, and more. They serve applications like self-ordering, check-in, ticketing, wayfinding, and more.
