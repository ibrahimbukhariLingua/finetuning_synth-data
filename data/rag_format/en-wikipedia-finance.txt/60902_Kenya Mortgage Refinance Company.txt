Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company


# Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company



**Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company Plc** (**KMRC**), is a financial services company in Kenya, that specializes in lending to other financial institutions in the country, for onward lending in form of mortgages. In addition, KMRC buys good mortgages from other lenders to make more money available to banks for onward lending to eligible homeowners. It also plans to "invest in government debt securities or other guaranteed debt".


## Overview

The institution is a greenfield start-up, established in August 2018, as a public private partnership between the government of Kenya and the major mortgage lenders in the country. As of July 2020, it had shareholders equity of KES:2 billion (US$20 million), with committed total assets of KES:37 billion (US$351 million). At that time KMRC was awaiting regulatory approval to commence business operations.


## Operations

KMRC will be regulated and supervised by the Central Bank of Kenya. The KMRC Board of Directors will comprise seven individuals who will set policy that will govern and guide the company. The World Bank and the African Development Bank have committed to lend KES:25 billion (US$250 million) and KES:10 billion (US$100 million) respectively, to KMRC.

It is expected that KMRC will provide financing to mortgage institutions at 5 percent for onward lending at 7 percent to homeowners earning less than KES:150,000 (US$1,500) per month. Such a homeowner could borrow up to KES:4 million (US$40,000), paying KES:31,000 (US$310) monthly, for 20 consecutive years. This is approximately 50 percent of the least expensive mortgage product on the market, before KMRC began operations.
