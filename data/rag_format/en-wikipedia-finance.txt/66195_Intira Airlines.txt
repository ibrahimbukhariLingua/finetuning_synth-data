# Intira Airlines



**Intira Airlines** (also spelled "Airline"; formerly **Business Air**) was a charter airline based at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand.


## History

Business Air was formed in 2008 to accommodate the tourism industry and other aviation charter services. It was granted the Air Operator License and Air Operator Certificate from Department of Civil Aviation (Thailand) (DCA) in November 2009, permitting international operations, with its first flight in December 2009.

The carrier has since experienced financial difficulties, with unpaid fees of fuel surcharge, air traffic control services and aircraft lessors for more than 1 billion THB (approx. 30.7 million USD), which caused the DCA to ordered Business Air to suspend its operation on 16 January 2015, leaving more than 1,000 passengers affected. However, on 24 January 2015, the Administrative Court of Thailand granted a preliminary injunction, allowing the airline to resume operations in the wake of ongoing liability and litigation. The airline was rebranded as "Intira Airlines" in June 2015 under the new ownership, but never launched.
