## Career

His career in the entertainment industry began in 1991 when he founded Urban Sound Exchange, an independent chain of retail music stores. Building and acquiring several music distribution ventures over ten years, including CDPlus.com and Records on Wheels, Throop became CEO of ROW Entertainment (ROW) in 2001. Throop diversified its operations through a series of acquisitions, including overseeing the purchase of Video One Canada, Canada's largest home entertainment company.

As CEO of ROW, Throop took the company public in 2003 and then orchestrated the acquisition of Koch Records, North America's largest independent music label and subsequently changed the company name to Entertainment One. With the company's comprehensive U.S. Canadian distribution network, Throop began aggressively acquiring the rights for specialty content. In 2007, to fund expansion into independent feature film distribution and rights ownership, Throop orchestrated the movement of Entertainment One to London's Alternative Investment Market in a $200 million IPO.

Shortly after the listing, Throop began acquiring leading content producers and distributors around the globe. Stepping up to the main market of the London Stock Exchange in 2010, Entertainment One was confirmed as a FTSE 250 entrant in the FTSE UK Index Series in 2013. In 2019, he sold the company to American toy manufacturer Hasbro for nearly $4 billion and he remains the CEO to date.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
