# Michael Lewis



**Michael Monroe Lewis** (born October 15, 1960) is an American author and financial journalist. He has also been a contributing editor to *Vanity Fair* since 2009, writing mostly on business, finance, and economics. He is known for his nonfiction work, particularly his coverage of financial crises and behavioral finance.

Lewis was born in New Orleans and attended Princeton University, from which he graduated with a degree in art history. After attending the London School of Economics, he began a career on Wall Street during the 1980s as a bond salesman at Salomon Brothers. The experience prompted him to write his first book, *Liar's Poker* (1989). Fourteen years later, Lewis wrote *Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game* (2003), in which he investigated the success of the Oakland Athletics baseball team and their general manager Billy Beane. His 2006 book *The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game* was his first to be adapted into a film, *The Blind Side* (2009). In 2010, he released *The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine*. The film adaptation of *Moneyball* was released in 2011, followed by *The Big Short* in 2015.

Lewis's books have won two Los Angeles Times Book Prizes and several have reached number one on *The New York Times Best Seller list*, including his most recent book, *Going Infinite* (2023).


## Early life and education

Lewis was born in New Orleans, the son of corporate attorney J. Thomas Lewis and community activist Diana Monroe Lewis. He went to Isidore Newman School. He later attended Princeton University and graduated *cum laude* with a B.A. in art and archaeology in 1982 after completing a 166-page senior thesis titled "Donatello and the Antique." At Princeton, Lewis was a member of the Ivy Club. He briefly worked with New York City art dealer Daniel Wildenstein. In an interview with Charlie Rose, Lewis said that his initial ambition was to become an art historian, but he was quickly dissuaded once he realized that there would be no jobs available for art historians and that even the handful that existed did not pay well.

Lewis subsequently enrolled at the London School of Economics and received an MA in economics in 1985. He was hired by Salomon Brothers, stayed for a while in New York for its training program, and then relocated to London, where he worked at its London office as a bond salesman for a few years. He has said that the journalism from this era found in *The Economist* and *The Wall Street Journal* inspired him to explore becoming a writer.


## Career


### Writing

Lewis described his experiences at Salomon and the evolution of the mortgage-backed bond in *Liar's Poker* (1989). In *The New New Thing* (1999), he investigated the then-booming Silicon Valley and the obsession with innovation. Four years later, Lewis wrote *Moneyball* (2003), in which he investigated the success of Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics. In August 2007, he wrote an article about catastrophe bonds, "In Nature's Casino", that ran in *The New York Times Magazine*.

Lewis has worked for *The Spectator*, *The New York Times Magazine*, as a columnist for Bloomberg, as a senior editor and campaign correspondent to *The New Republic*, and a visiting fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. He wrote the *Dad Again* column for *Slate*. Lewis worked for Conde Nast Portfolio, but in February 2009 left to join *Vanity Fair*, where he became a contributing editor.

In September 2011, after the successful release of the film adaptation of *Moneyball*, it was reported that Lewis planned to take on "a much more active role in the what could be the next film based on one of his books" and would start writing a script for a *Liar's Poker* film.

During 2013 in *Vanity Fair*, Lewis wrote on the injustice of the prosecution of ex-Goldman Sachs programmer Sergey Aleynikov, who is given an entire chapter in *Flash Boys*. *Flash Boys*, which looked at high-frequency trading of Wall Street and other markets, was released in March 2014.

Lewis's 2015 *Vanity Fair* article "How Tom Wolfe Became ... Tom Wolfe", about the journalist and writer Tom Wolfe, became the basis for the documentary film *Radical Wolfe*, directed by Richard Dewey and released in 2023.

In 2016, Lewis published *The Undoing Project*, chronicling the close academic collaboration and personal relationship between Israeli psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. The duo found systemic errors in human judgment under uncertainty, with implications for models of decision-making in fields such as economics, medicine, and sports.

In 2017, Lewis wrote a series of articles for *Vanity Fair* in which he described the Trump administration's approach to various federal agencies, including the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture. His articles described a sense of incredulity and disillusionment from career civil servants, particularly because of the Trump administration's lack of attention to some of their work, and the lack of care, knowledge, experience, and respect from Trump political appointees.

That material was incorporated into Lewis's book *The Fifth Risk*, which was on the *New York Times* nonfiction best-seller list for 14 weeks, and described the disconnect between the Obama administration's well-prepared transition plans and the incoming Trump administration's apparent lack of concern. Along with Energy and Agriculture, this book added Commerce among the main departments described.

In September 2018, *The Guardian* published an excerpt from the book, using a quote by Trump advisor Steve Bannon in its title: "This Guy Doesn't Know Anything". The excerpt was republished again among a review of the most popular articles of the year.

In 2018, Lewis wrote and narrated *The Coming Storm* for Audible Studios, which released the short nonfiction story as part of its new Audible Originals series of audiobooks.

In 2023, he wrote *Going Infinite*, about the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and what came to be the collapse of FTX.


### Broadcasting and podcasts

Lewis's podcast, *Against the Rules*, first aired on April 2, 2019. The first season comprised seven episodes, each taking on a different aspect of society addressing the concept of fairness "in realms ranging from art authentication to consumer finance". The show often refers to the growing social distrust for authority, and refers to different types of public officials as "referees." *Against the Rules* is produced by Pushkin Industries, the media company founded by journalist Malcolm Gladwell and former *Slate* executive Jacob Weisberg.

On January 12, 2020, Lewis appeared as one of the castaways on BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs*.


## Reception

In a review of *Moneyball*, Dan Ackman of *Forbes* said that Lewis had a special talent: "He can walk into an area already mined by hundreds of writers and find gems there all along but somehow missed by his predecessors". A *New York Times* piece said that "no one writes with more narrative panache about money and finance than Mr. Lewis", praising his ability to use his subject's stories to show the problems with the systems around them.

Critics from outside the financial industry have criticized Lewis for what they consider inaccuracies in his writing. In a 2011 column in *The Atlantic*, American journalist and sports author Allen Barra took issue with Lewis's characterization of Major League Baseball in *Moneyball*, writing, "From a historical standpoint, Lewis is, well, way off base. By the end of the 20th century baseball had achieved a greater level of competitive balance than at any time in the game's history... *Moneyball* doesn't just get the state of present-day baseball wrong; it also misrepresents the history of the sport."

Lewis's *Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt* ignited a new round of controversy surrounding high-frequency trading. At a House Financial Services Committee hearing in April 2014, Mary Jo White, a former Wall Street insider (as a Debevoise & Plimpton lawyer primarily for Wall Street financial firms) who later served as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, denied the book's premise, saying, "The markets are not rigged". In June 2014, White announced that the SEC would undergo a new round of regulatory review in response to concerns about dark pools and market structure.

Book critics widely praised Lewis's *The Undoing Project*, with Glenn C. Altschuler writing in the *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* that it "may well be his best book".

His 2023 book *Going Infinite*, an intimate account of Sam Bankman-Fried and his firm FTX, was written while FTX was collapsing and published the day Bankman-Fried's trial on charges of fraud and money laundering began. Lewis was criticized for giving Bankman-Fried's explanations for FTX's losses excessive deference, with journalist Michael Hiltzik calling the Bankman-Fried hype a "torrent of nonsense". *The New York Times* wrote of Lewis's extensive access to Bankman-Fried that he had "a front-row seatâ€”from which he could apparently see nothing." Others praised Lewis's storytelling, with *The New Yorker* calling the book "stupefyingly pleasurable" to read and filling "many gaps" in the story, ultimately predicting that the book "may one day be regarded as either the pinnacle or the nadir of his career".


## Personal life

Lewis has been married three times. He married his first wife, Diane de Cordova Lewis, in 1985. His second marriage was to former CNBC correspondent Kate Bohner; they got engaged three weeks after their first date. In October 1997, he married former MTV reporter Tabitha Soren. She gave birth to their three children, daughters Quinn and Dixie, followed by son Walker. In 2021, their middle child, daughter Dixie, was a passenger in a head-on collision with a semi truck near Truckee, California; the driver, her boyfriend, had inexplicably crossed the median. Both Dixie and her boyfriend were pronounced dead at the scene.

Lewis and Soren reside in the Oakland Hills above Berkeley, California.

Lewis is an atheist.
