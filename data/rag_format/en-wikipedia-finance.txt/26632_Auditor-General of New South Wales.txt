Auditor-General of New South Wales


# Auditor-General of New South Wales



The **auditor-general of New South Wales** helps the Parliament of New South Wales hold government accountable for its use of public resources.

The auditor-general is responsible for audits of NSW Government agencies, universities, and NSW local government, and also provides certain assurance services for Commonwealth grants and payments to the State under Commonwealth legislation. The auditor-general is the head of the Audit Office of New South Wales (AONSW), a statutory authority and integrity agency established under the *Government Sector Audit Act 1983* to conduct audits for the auditor-general.

The auditor-general is independent of the Government, and is accountable to the Parliament of New South Wales and regularly reports on the audits. Parliament promotes independence by ensuring the auditor-general and AONSW are not compromised in their roles by:

* providing that only Parliament, and not the executive government, can remove an auditor-general
* mandating the auditor-general as auditor of public sector agencies
* precluding the auditor-general from providing non-audit and assurance services

The Legislative Assembly Public Accounts Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor-general, prior to the official appointment by the governor of New South Wales.

In 2016, the *Local Government Act 1993* expanded the auditor-general's mandate to include financial and performance auditing of NSW local government.

In 2016-17, AONSW completed 426 financial audits of NSW Government agencies and NSW universities, as well as seventeen performance audits. In 2017-18, this increased to 550 financial audits of NSW Government agencies, NSW universities and NSW local councils, and nineteen performance audits, as a result of the mandate to audit NSW local government.

## Legislative Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC)

The auditor-general and the Audit Office of New South Wales work closely with Legislative Assembly Public Accounts Committee. The committee was first established in 1902 to scrutinise the actions of the executive branch of government on behalf of the Legislative Assembly.

The Public Accounts Committee has responsibilities under Part 4 of the *Public Finance and Audit Act 1983* to inquire into and report on activities of government that are reported in the Total State Sector Accounts and the accounts of the State's authorities. A key part of committee activity is following up aspects of the Auditor-General's Reports to Parliament. The committee may also receive referrals from ministers, the Legislative Assembly and the auditor-general to undertake inquiries. The committee may also recommend improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of government activities.
