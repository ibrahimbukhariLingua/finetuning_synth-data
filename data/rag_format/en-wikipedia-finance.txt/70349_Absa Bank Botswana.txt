## History

According to the bank's website, it started operating in Botswana as a branch of Barclays Bank Plc of the United Kingdom, in 1950. In 1975, Barclays Bank of Botswana was incorporated as a legal business entity and continued to operate in the country, as a subsidiary of Barclays. On 19 June 1989, the shares of the bank were listed on the Botswana Stock Exchange, where today, they trade under the symbol **ABBL**.


## Name change

Barclays Bank Plc, which owned 62.3 percent of Barclays Africa Group (BAG), the then majority shareholder of Barclays Bank of Botswana Limited in 2016, decided to divest its majority shareholding in BAG, worth Â£3.5 billion at that time. In 2017 Barclays reduced its shareholding in BAG to 14.9 percent.

Subsequently, in 2018 BAG re-branded to Absa Group Limited.
Under the terms of that re-brand, Absa had until June 2020 to change the names of its subsidiaries in 12 African countries.

Beginning in December 2019, Barclays Bank Botswana Limited began re-branding to Absa Bank Botswana Limited. The re-brand concluded on 10 February 2020, when both the bank's legal and business names became Absa Bank Botswana Limited.


## Governance

The bank is supervised by a five-person board of directors, chaired by Oduetse Andrew Motshidisi, one of the non-executive directors. The managing director and CEO is Keabetswe Pheko-Moshagane.
