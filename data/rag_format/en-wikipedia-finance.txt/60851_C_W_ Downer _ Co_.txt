## History

Charles W. Downer founded C.W. Downer & Co. in 1975 to provide cross-border merger and acquisition advisory services with a primary focus on middle-market company ($20–500 million) transactions. In 1980, the firm opened its first international office in Paris. It later established offices in Sydney, Dublin, Frankfurt, Shanghai, Madrid, Oslo, and Mumbai.

In April 2008, the firm changed its name from Downer & Company to C.W. Downer & Co. The firm trademarked its tagline, “Because the middle-market is global,” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Charles W. Downer was awarded the Association for Corporate Growth's 2010 Lifetime Achievement Award.

On April 27, 2016, C.W. Downer & Co. completed its previously announced merger with N+1, a global investment bank and asset management firm headquartered in Madrid, Spain. In addition to M&A advisory, N+1 offers debt advisory, restructuring, and equity and debt capital market services. The combined entity employed 240 investment banking professionals across 14 offices in 13 countries. The company was renamed **N+1 Downer**.

On September 26, 2016, N+1 Downer became Alantra. With this decision, the partners of the 19 countries and different businesses did away with brands that existed from 15 to 40 years, including N+1, Downer, Swiss Capital, Daruma, and Dinamia. Alantra's 57 partners and 345 professionals operate from 25 global offices.
