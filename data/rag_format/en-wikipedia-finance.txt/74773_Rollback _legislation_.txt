Rollback (legislation)


# Rollback (legislation)



In government and economic contexts, **Rollback** metaphorically denotes action to repeal, dismantle or otherwise diminish the effect of a law or regulation.


## Trade legislation

The term was utilised by the MAI Negotiating Group in the 1990s in the context of seeking to enforce legislative progress toward "free trade". Rollback of trade-protective measures was to be made compulsory under the agreement.

> Rollback is the liberalisation process by which the reduction and eventual elimination of nonconforming measures to the MAI would take place. It is a dynamic element linked with standstill, which provides its starting point. Combined with standstill, it would produce a “ratchet effect”, where any new liberalisation measures would be “locked in” so they could not be rescinded or nullified over time.
