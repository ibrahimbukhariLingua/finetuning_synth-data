# Castlight Health



**Castlight Health** was a San Franciscoâ€“based healthcare navigation company. It offered comparison tools showing price and quality metrics for tests and procedures offered by healthcare providers.

The Castlight platform was licensed through a business-to-business-based model. Employees of companies that had purchased subscriptions got access to the Castlight platform. Health plan partners, such as Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, provided commercial members with access to Castlight's tools as well. In 2012 the company secured $100 million in investment funds. In 2014 the company had its initial public offering, valued at $2 billion. The company claimed to have grown to work with "over 260 customers covering 10 million lives" on the platform.


## Acquisition by Vera Whole Health, Inc

On the 5th of January 2022 it was announced that Castlight would be acquired by Vera Whole Health for $370 million USD. Vera launched a tender offer of $2.05 for all outstanding Class A and B shares.

The same day of the announcement, Halper Sadeh LLP, an investor rights law firm, announced an investigation into whenever $2.05 per share was a fair price for investors. As of November 7th 2023, it is unclear what that the fate of this investigation is.
