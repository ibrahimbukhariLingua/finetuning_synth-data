## History

Afrinvest was founded in 1995 by Godwin Obaseki as Securities Transactions & Trust Company (Nigeria) Limited (“SecTrust”). Over the years, SecTrust established a close relationship with its London-based partners (“Afrinvest Limited”), an investment banking firm regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority (“FSA”). Following commencement of its business restructuring in 2005, SecTrust combined with the Nigeria-based corporate finance business of Afrinvest (UK) Limited.

This phase of business restructuring was concluded in December 2005 and culminated in the renaming of SecTrust as Afrinvest (West Africa) Limited.

The company is registered as an Issuing House by the SEC while its other two subsidiaries, Afrinvest Securities Limited and Afrinvest Asset Management Limited, house the company's broker-dealer and fund manager licenses respectively.
