# Ningbo Merchants Group



The **Ningbo Merchants Group** (simplified Chinese: 宁波商帮; traditional Chinese: 寧波商幫; pinyin: *Níngbō Shāng Bāng*), or just simply **Ningbo Group**, also known as the **Grassroots Businessmen**, was one of the ten largest commercial groups during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and it became the single biggest commercial regional group of China in the Late Qing dynasty.


## History

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the Ningbo Group had business in banking and insurance; shipbuilding, both junks and steamships; clothing, both locally produced and imported from western countries; medicine; and fishing. During the Beiyang government period, their trade influence spread to Shanghai, Wuhan, and Tianjin.

In the mid-20th century, Ningbo merchants expanded to Hong Kong and overseas to Taiwan, amongst other places.

In 2004, the Ningbo Gang Conference was held and called for the creation of a "New Ningbo Gang" to aid to development of Ningbo. The legacy of the Ningbo Group is taken up by the International Ningbo Merchants Association
