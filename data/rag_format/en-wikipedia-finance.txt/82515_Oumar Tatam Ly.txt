### Prime minister

Tatam Ly was appointed as Prime Minister of Mali by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta on 5 September 2013, a day after Keïta was sworn in as President. After being swore in, Tatam Ly focused on achieving the President's promises of bringing the people of Mali together and ending Mali's systemic corruption. In order to fulfill Keita's promises, Tatam Ly created the post of Minister of Reconciliation and assigned the position to Cheick Ouamar Diarrah.

At the end of November 2013, his proposed visit to the northern city of Kidal and the consequent police repression of protests led to the MNLA aborting the ceasefire agreement.

Tatam Ly and his cabinet resigned on 5 April 2014. Moussa Mara was appointed to replace him on the same day.
