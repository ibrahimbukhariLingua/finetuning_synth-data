## History

On November 30, 1998, Tibet Everest Motorcycle Industry Company, as the principal promoter, established Tibet Everest Industry Company Limited in collaboration with Tibet Autonomous Region Trust and Investment Company, Tibet Autonomous Region Native Animal Products Import and Export Company, Tibet International Economic and Technical Cooperation Company, Tibet Saiya Economic and Trade Service Company, and four additional promoters.

In August 2005, the company executed a significant asset reorganization, finalizing the transition of its core activity from the production and sale of motorcycle products and components to the smelting of non-ferrous metals such as zinc and indium. In August 2015, the Company executed a significant asset reorganization and performed a non-public share issuance to acquire assets, obtaining 100% equity stake in Tajik-Chinese Mining (Chinese: 塔中矿业) situated in Tajikistan. Simultaneously, the Company finalized the divestiture of its first non-ferrous metal smelting assets in 2017, successfully transitioning into a specialized developer of non-ferrous metal mining resources.

In April 2018, the Company fully acquired two lithium salt lake assets in Argentina (Angeles Salt Lake Project and Alizaro Salt Lake Project), thereby joining the upstream lithium resource development sector of the new energy industry.
