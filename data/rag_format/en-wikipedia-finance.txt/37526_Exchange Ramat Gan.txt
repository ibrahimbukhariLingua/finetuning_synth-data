# Exchange Ramat Gan



**Exchange Ramat Gan** is a building complex that includes two skyscrapers located near the Diamond Exchange District in Ramat Gan, Israel. Of the two towers, the taller tower, at 206 m (676 ft) tall, will serve as a residential building, and contains 61 floors: 3 commercial floors, a mezzanine, 55 residential floors, and 2 mechanical floors, and will overall include 355 residential units. The shorter tower, at 198 m (650 ft) tall, will serve as an office building and includes 50 floors.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The complex sits on 11 of the 15 dunams (2.7 out of 3.7 acres) of land that used to house an Elite chocolate factory, of which 4 dunams remains preserved and contains a building that is currently used by Shenkar College.


## History

Following the closure of the Elite chocolate factory, Strauss Group sold the site to the Trump Organization and Crescent Heights for $44 million in 2006, and plans began to build a $300 million skyscraper at the site named Trump Plaza Tower. The skyscraper was to be a luxury 70-story apartment building which would have been tallest building in Israel. Plans for the Trump Plaza Tower were shelved in 2007 when the site was sold for $80 million to Israeli construction company Azorim and other private investors.

Azorim planned to build a $175 million, 74-floor skyscraper which would have also been the tallest building in Israel at 270 m (890 ft). The tower was planned to have 72,000 m² (780,000 sq ft) of residential, office, and hotel space. Planning for the tower was frozen by Azorim as a result of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, but resumed in late 2009.

By early 2014, the plans for the site had shifted to two separate towers: an all-residential building to be developed by Azorim and an office building to be developed separately by the private investors. Azorim announced that the all-residential skyscraper would have a height of 265 m (869 ft), which still would have been the tallest building in Israel, with a total of 65 stories and 338 residential units as well as a lounge that is accessible to all of the building's residents. On the top floor, the architect said that there were plans for a viewing room with a cafe. Construction was expected to begin sometime in 2014 and be completed by 2017.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In early March 2015, Azorim announced to purchasers of units in the tower that construction of the tower was canceled due to a delay in obtaining a permit from the Ramat Gan city council, in part due to the city council's new requirements for obtaining the permit.

In August 2016, the district committee presented a plan to construct a complex that included a 60-story tall residential building and a 45-story tall office building, which was later changed to 50 stories tall after the private investors sold it to the Israeli insurance company Migdal for ₪325 million. The office building was to have its bottom 2 floors be dedicated to commercial space, and share a parking lot with the residential tower. Adjacent to the two skyscrapers, Maslavi Construction had completed a 30-story tall residential tower with 153 residential units called the Elite Tower, which was previously a name commonly used to call buildings that were planned to be built at the former site of the Elite chocolate factory.

In July 2020, the casting of the foundations was completed and construction of the towers had officially begun.

Near the end of 2023, both towers had reached their final height,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and the residential tower had become the second tallest building in Ramat Gan as well as the second tallest residential building in Israel (after the Hi Tower in Givatayim).
