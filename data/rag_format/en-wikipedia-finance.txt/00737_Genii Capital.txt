On 8 December 2010, Renault made public it would sell its remaining 25% share in the Enstone-based team, Renault F1 team, to Genii Capital, from that moment the sole shareholder. Group Lotus immediately became a partner of the team, renamed Lotus Renault GP. It was projected that the carmaker company would purchase a significant share of it.
