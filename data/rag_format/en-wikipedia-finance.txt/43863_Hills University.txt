## Background

According to the McKinsey Global Institute, Africa is projected to be the world's second-fastest growing economy by 2020. With growth comes a need for leaders who can address and navigate challenges and opportunities. UC strives to contribute to the region's human and economic development by educating leaders committed to making an impact on the continent.
