IDFPR became responsible for licensing and regulating the dispensaries that sell medical cannabis to patients, along with each dispensariesâ€™ Principal Officers, Agents-in-Charge, and Agents.

On June 25, 2019, Governor Pritzker signed the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which made Illinois the 11th state to legalize adult use cannabis. IDFPR oversaw the successful rollout of the program, which allowed existing medical cannabis dispensaries to begin selling adult use cannabis on January 1, 2020. Similar to its medical cannabis licensing responsibilities, IDFPR licenses adult use cannabis dispensaries, along with the Principal Officers, Agents-in-Charge, and Agents at each dispensary.
