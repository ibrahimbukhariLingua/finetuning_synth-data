Desert Financial Credit Union


# Desert Financial Credit Union



**Desert Financial Credit Union** is a credit union based in Phoenix, Arizona, that operates 47 branches and service centers throughout Coconino, Gila, Maricopa, Pinal, and Yavapai counties and now statewide in Arizona. Desert Financial remains federally insured by the NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) and in addition will be regulated by the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions, which regulates state chartered credit unions in Arizona. Desert Financial is the largest credit union in Arizona, managing nearly $8.5 billion in assets as of October 2022.


## History

Desert Financial was originally named Arizona Educational Association (A.E.A.) #1 Federal Credit Union and was chartered in 1939 to serve the financial needs of area teachers. In 1972, the credit union rebranded to Desert Schools Federal Credit Union (following a brief existence as Desert School Employees Federal Credit Union) to better define its niche market. In 1996, they expanded their charter to serve three counties in Arizona and disregarded vocation as a membership qualifier. In 2020, Desert Financial became a statewide charter.

In 2018, the Desert Schools Federal Credit Union was renamed Desert Financial Credit Union, in order to address misconceptions that it still only served members of the education community. The rebranding was promoted during a commercial aired locally during Super Bowl LII, featuring Phoenix native Alice Cooper and playing upon his band's 1972 song "School's Out".

In 2019, Desert Financial bought the naming rights to the Arizona State University arena and renamed it to the Desert Financial Arena. The agreement cost $1.5 million per year for 5 years.
