## History


### 1989-2007


#### Asia Netcom

In 1999, Global Crossing, Microsoft and Softbank started Asia Global Crossing as a venture to build a US$2 billion cable system, East Asia Crossing (EAC), to connect key Asian markets. In 2000, Asia Global Crossing was listed on NASDAQ, before its listing was moved to NYSE in 2001.

Following the dotcom crash, Asia Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, and was subsequently delisted from NYSE. To raise additional funding to continue operations, the company sold its assets to a consortium led by China Netcom, Newbridge Capital and Softbank Asia Infrastructure Fund for US$120 million, forming Asia Netcom.

In late 2003, China Netcom acquired 100 percent of Asia Netcom, and the wholly owned subsidiary became part of the China Netcom's public listing on NYSE and SEHK in 2004.

In 2006, China Netcom sold Asia Netcom to Connect Holdings Limited, an investor group consisting of Ashmore Investment Management Limited, Spinnaker Capital Limited and Clearwater Capital Partners, for US$402 million.

In 2007, Asia Netcom's EAC merged with C2C, another submarine cable network owned by Connect Holdings, to form a 36,800 km submarine cable network, EAC-C2C.


#### Pacific Internet

In 1989, TechNet was started as a research and development computer network for use by academia at the National University of Singapore. Funded by the National Science and Technology Board of Singapore (NSTB), it became Singapore's first Internet Service Provider. In 1995, it was acquired by SembMedia, a division of Singapore conglomerate Sembawang Group, and renamed Pacific Internet Corporation Private Limited. In September the same year, Pacific Internet began its commercial operations in Singapore.

In 1996, Pacific Internet expanded into Hong Kong via an acquisition, increasing its equity stake in the ISP to 100 percent in 1999. In 1997, the company commenced its Philippines operations through a local partner, which was acquired by Pacific Internet a year later.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

It was announced on 23 December 2014 that Pacnet would be acquired by Telstra, Australia's largest telecommunications and media company. Telstra's acquisition of Pacnet was expected to be completed by mid-2015, and includes interests in its China joint venture, Pacnet Business Solutions (PBS), licensed to operate a domestic Internet Protocol Virtual Private Network and provide data centre services in most major provinces in China. Telstra announced the completion of the acquisition in April 2015.

In November 2015 – SGX-Catalist listed DeClout Limited has signed a deal with Pacnet Internet (S) Pte Ltd ("Pacnet Internet Singapore"), a subsidiary of Telstra Corporation Limited ("Telstra"), Australia's leading telecommunications company, to acquire certain Internet Service Provider assets and business in Singapore and Thailand from Pacnet Internet Singapore. Upon the completion of the acquisition, the acquired assets were merged with Acclivis’ existing ISP business, OSINet, and together, rebranded as Pacific Internet, allowing Acclivis to broaden its offerings and achieve further economies of scale in the ISP segment.

In July 2018, Telstra Global is closing Pacnet and migrating users to Telstra's network.


## Submarine communications cable network


### EAC-C2C

Pacnet's pan-Asia EAC-C2C network was formed from the integration of the EAC (East Asia Crossing) and CSC systems in 2007. The fibre optic subsea cable network spans 36,800 km between Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore and China. It has a design capacity of 17.92 Tbit/s to 30.72 Tbit/s to each of these landing countries. The EAC-C2C network lands at 18 cable landing stations across Asia.
