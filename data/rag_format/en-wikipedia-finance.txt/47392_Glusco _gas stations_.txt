## Overview

Previously before Rosneft acquired the TNK network of filling stations in Ukraine which was owned by TNK-BP, in 2010 the TNK-BP Commerce bought for a record sum for Ukrainian market of $313 million a network of 114 Ukrtatnafta filling stations belong to "Vic Oil" (through UTN-Vostok). Before that in 2009 TNK-BP acquired several filling stations Zolotoy Gepard around Kyiv.

The company was established in 2016 after the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine and boycott of the Rosneft gas stations.

In January 2016 Greenenergo Trading S.A. petitioned to obtain the network after Rosneft announced that it is leaving the Ukrainian market of crude oil products. In March 2016 Greenenergo Trading S.A filed a second petition to the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine after the initial petition was denied.


### Establishment of Glusco Ukraine

The company was registered in July 2016. In December 2016 Greenenergo Trading S.A. received approval from the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine to buy a network of gas station from Rosneft Management Company Limited (Nicosia, Cyprus) represented in Ukraine as "Vostok". The Vostok's gas stations operated under various names such as TNK, Zolotoy Gepard, Formula, others. Sometimes before 2011, the TNK-Rosneft acquired the Kyivan Zolotoy Gepard and the All-Ukrainian Vic Oil. The transfer of assets was finalized in December 2017. Along with a network of filling stations, Glusco also obtained the Lysychansk Oil Refinery earlier belonging to TNK-Rosneft, while some news media speculated that oil refinery in Lysychansk was not intended for sale.

Several journalists and experts of crude oil product markets pointed out that, several traditional importers of liquified gas to Ukraine began having problems with the Security Service of Ukraine, Ministry of Economic Development and customs, while other started to import, such gas in large quantities from Russia. The press service of public organization "Ukrainskiy vybor" that is headed by Viktor Medvedchuk on journalist inquiry about the Medvedchuk's connection with the transfer denied any allegations or implies for such connection.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### Conflicts

In 2018 the company had a conflict over a land lot with the Dovzhenko Film Studios in Kyiv that was previously working as TNK, but The Dovzhenko Film Studios posted at its website a denial of its allegations towards the Glusco's subsidiary company.

In March 2021 the Security Service of Ukraine arrested Glusco's fueling stations because of the criminal case of sale of low-quality petroleum products. This situation blocked the company from selling petrol, however they could still sell gas and products and their minimarkets were in operation. In June Glusco tried to renew the selling of petrol, but the attempt was failed. In August, being on the edge of bankruptcy, the company decided to rent out around seven of the company's fueling stations, due to that some of their stations in Kyiv were rebranded as WOG, KLO and BRSM Nafta.
