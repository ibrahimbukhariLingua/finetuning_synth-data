### Famous Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios

**Famous Studios** (later renamed **Paramount Cartoon Studios** in 1956) was Paramount Pictures' first animation division. It was founded as a successor to Fleischer Studios after Paramount seized its founders, Max and Dave Fleischer's control in 1941. The studio's productions included three series started by the Fleischer Popeye the Sailor, Superman, and *Screen Songs*. It also featured Harvey Comic characters such as *Little Audrey*, *Little Lulu*, *Casper the Friendly Ghost*, *Honey Halfwitch*, *Herman and Katnip*, *Baby Huey*, and the anthology *Noveltoons* series. After the animation studio shut down in 1967, Paramount sold most of these original characters back to their original owners.


### Terrytoons

**Terrytoons** was founded in 1929 by Paul Terry, Frank Moser, and Joseph Coffman. The studio has brought many cartoon characters such as Mighty Mouse, Heckle & Jeckle, Gandy Goose, Sourpuss, Dinky Duck, Luno, and Farmer Al Falfa (from Bray Productions, the studios' predecessor). 20th Century Fox (and its precursor Fox Films) originally released Terrytoons theatrical shorts. In 1955, CBS purchased the studio. The theatrical library was transferred under Paramount Pictures (via the ViacomCBS re-merger). Its television library still remains under CBS Entertainment Group.


## Paramount Television Group


### CBS Eye Animation Productions

Founded in 2018, **CBS Eye Animation Productions** is the animation production arm of CBS Studios. Its first projects announced were two *Star Trek* animated series, *Star Trek: Lower Decks* and *Star Trek: Prodigy* (for Nickelodeon & Paramount+).

Founded in 1990, Nickelodeon Animation Studio was originally named **Games Animation** (previously **Games Productions Inc.**); it oversaw the production of animated programs for Nickelodeon such as Doug, *Rugrats*, and *The Ren & Stimpy Show* with *Rocko's Modern Life* becoming Games Animation's first fully in-house series produced for the network. In 1998-99 the studio's name was changed to **Nickelodeon Animation Studio** following relocation from Studio City, California to Burbank with a second facility in New York City in 1999.


### MTV Animation

Established in 1986, **MTV Animation** began by producing several animated shorts that aired as bumpers for its namesake network. While its department is often grouped with that of Nickelodeon's, the two entities are completely separate. MTV's cartoons typically have more dark humor, sexual jokes, graphic violence, and pop culture references than its sister studio. In the early 2000s, MTV Animation branched out to Web-based content. As of recently, the current state of the studio remains unknown.
