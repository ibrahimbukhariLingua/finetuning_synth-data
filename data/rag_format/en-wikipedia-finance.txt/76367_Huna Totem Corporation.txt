Huna Totem provides financial benefits to its shareholders primarily in four ways: dividends from corporate profits, distributions from the Huna Totem Corporation Shareholders Settlement Trust, a one-time payment to original shareholders upon reaching age 65 from the HTC Elders' Benefit Trust, and funding of educational scholarships which are awarded by the Huna Heritage Foundation. In 2012 Huna Totem Corporation generated revenue from several business lines, including tourism, natural resources, interpretive services, commercial real estate and leasing, construction, and its investment portfolio. In earlier years, the timber industry brought in money for many village corporations.
