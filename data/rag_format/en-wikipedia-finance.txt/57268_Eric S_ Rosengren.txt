As President and CEO of the Federal Reserve, Rosengren supported a number of efforts to expand the Boston Fed's outreach and impact on low- and moderate-income communities - including hosting foreclosure-prevention workshops for New England residents during the Great Recession, and running a competition for postindustrial New England communities to develop cross-sector collaboration and ultimately help improve the lives of lower-income residents.

In 2020, Rosengren directly traded sizeable amounts of four REITs, including Annaly Capital Management Inc., a REIT that holds mortgage-backed securities. During the time that he made these trades, the Fed had begun buying $40 billion of this type of debt per month, a fact that Rosengren, as a Federal Open Market Committee participant in 2020, would have had non-publicly available knowledge of; he had also advocated specific Fed policies that would have a bearing on the value of these assets. Rosengren was criticized for these activities, which involved trades of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars, and which critics claimed undermined confidence in the activities of the Federal Reserve. After the revelations concerning these trades by Rosengren and millions of dollars worth of trades by Robert Kaplan, his colleague at the Federal Reserve, Sen. Elizabeth Warren called on all Federal Reserve presidents to be banned from trading and owning individual stocks. In response, Rosengren said he would sell his individual stocks.

On September 27, 2021, Rosengren announced his retirement beginning on September 30, citing a deteriorating kidney condition. The announcement comes after the Federal Reserve began a review of how it oversees the investments of officers. Rosengren was due to retire in June 2022 when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 65.

On January 22, 2024, the Federal Reserve inspector general concluded a probe that cleared Rosengren of trades in 2020, concluding that the trades were allowed under the Fed’s rules and there was no violation of central bank policies or the law.
