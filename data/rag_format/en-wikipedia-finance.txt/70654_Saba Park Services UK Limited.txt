## Operations

* University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff - a 15 year contract. It made a profit of £2.8 million in 2016 from this contract, from charges and fines. 80 staff who have been fined challenged the fines in court. The staff also claimed that just finding a space used up to an hour a day of their time and that their earnings may be insufficient to cover the fines. In July 2017 the doctors and nurses lost the case and were required to pay £128 per ticket issued, leading to a number of them handing in their notice. The hospital employs 6000 staff but only has 1800 parking spaces.
* Ninewells Hospital- a 30 year lease. Three nurses were ordered to pay the company more than £4,000 in September 2017 for a total of 30 unpaid fines at the hospital.
* It offers “premier parking” at most of the car parks it operates on behalf of Govia Thameslink Railway north of the Thames.
* Edenbridge Town railway station
* Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust which it took over October 2022.
