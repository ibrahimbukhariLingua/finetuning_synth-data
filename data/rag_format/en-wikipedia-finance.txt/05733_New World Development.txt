# New World Development



**New World Development Company Limited** (NWD), is a Hong Kong–based company focused on property, hotels, infrastructure and services and department stores. It was established on 29 May 1970 by Cheng Yu-tung. The company is publicly listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK: 17) since 23 November 1972 and was formerly a constituent stock of Hong Kong Hang Seng Index.

Over the last four decades, the group has also actively participated in various businesses in Mainland China and established itself as one of the largest foreign direct investors in the country. The group's existing investments in Mainland China has exceeded US$16.5 billion, spreading across four municipalities and over 19 provinces.


## History

New World Development was founded on May 29, 1970, with Dr. Ho Sin Hang as chairman and Cheng Yu-tung as Director and General Manager. The group went public on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK) (SEHK: 17) in 1972.


### Group Reorganization

To bring together infrastructure projects in Hong Kong and Mainland China, New World Infrastructure Limited (NWI) was created and listed on SEHK (SEHK: 301) in October 1995. New World Services Limited (NWS) was then formed in April 1997 to integrate the group's service-related businesses. By July 1999, New World China Land Limited (NWCL) was launched to consolidate the group’s property projects in Mainland China and was listed on SEHK (SEHK: 917).

In September 2001, NWS purchased all outstanding shares of Ngo Kee Construction Company Limited. A year later, Pacific Ports Company Limited (PPC) acquired NWI and took ownership of NWS from NWD.

Reorganization of New World Group was finalized in January 2003. Following a name change from Pacific Ports Company Limited, NWS Holdings Limited emerged as the group's service flagship, overseeing operations in services, infrastructure, and ports across Hong Kong, Macau, and Mainland China. All group shares were consolidated under NWS Holdings Limited, which then commenced trading on SEHK.


### Recent Developments

New World Department Store China Limited (SEHK: 0825) went public on SEHK in July 2007. The Guangzhou Dongxin Expressway—in which NWS Holdings owned a 40.8% ownership stake—officially inaugurated in December 2010.

In April 2015, NWD formed a 50-50 joint venture with HIP Company Limited, a subsidiary of The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, to acquire the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, Renaissance Harbour View, and Hyatt Regency TST with a deal valued at HK$18.5 billion, resulted in NWD receiving approximately HK$10 billion. NWD then launched its new healthcare brand, Humansa, and acquired FTLife in November and December 2018, respectively.

In October 2020, the group revealed plans to conserve Hong Kong’s 68-year-old State Theatre, a Grade I historic site, partnering with local and international designers and artisans. In that month, the group began selling THE PAVILIA FARM I, attracting 22,700 registrations in the first round, the highest for any residential property in Hong Kong since 1997. The group also committed over HKD 10 billion to create a large-scale cultural and retail complex in Prince Bay, Shenzhen.

In November 2020, NWD named its mixed-use development project within the SKYCITY complex at the Hong Kong International Airport "11 SKIES". NWD established Share for Good, Hong Kong's first large-scale crowd-donation platform in March 2022, to meet the immediate needs of the impoverished in the fifth wave of COVID-19. In collaboration with Rafa Nadal Academy, Hong Kong Golf & Tennis Academy welcomed Asia's first Rafa Nadal Tennis Center in July 2022.

NWD collaborated with 4 corporations in July 2023 to establish the first "Smart Community" in a transitional housing complex. NWD signed Hong Kong's first "Project Cooperation Agreement regarding Northern Metropolis" in December 2023, to develop a commercial and residential project in the Northern Metropolis with CR Land.

In 2024, NWD reported a HK$19.7 billion net loss for the year ended 30 June, the worst since the company was founded in 1970. Adrian Cheng Chi-Kong, the grandson of Cheng Yu-tung, was forced to step down as CEO in September. In December, NWD was kicked out of the Hang Seng Index (HSI). In the same month of being kicked out of HSI, Debtwire reported that NWD have sent out a letter to its bank lenders, seeking a waiver on loan conditions. NWD was seeking forbearance, after its net debt-to-assets ratio breached the 100 per cent threshold that may allow its lenders to recall their loans.

Upon linking their Visa cards to the K11 HK app, customers who spend with Visa can earn K Dollars automatically.


## Controversies


### Hung Hom Peninsula

The Hung Hom Peninsula was sold for a below-market land premium of HK$864 million to New World Development, who subsequently sold off half share to Sun Hung Kai Properties. In 2004, the consortium announced the demolition of these buildings to make way for luxury apartments, to be faced with huge popular outcry about the needless destruction of "perfectly good buildings" to satisfy "corporate greed". In an unprecedented about-turn, the developers withdrew the plan on 10 December 2004.


### Leung Chin-man

In 2008, New World was the subject of controversy when it announced it had hired former Permanent Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands Leung Chin-man as deputy managing director and executive director of its China subsidiary, New World China Land Ltd. The Secretary for the Civil Service Denise Yue Chung-yee, signed off on the approval for him to take up the job within three years of leaving, failing to take into account the appearance of conflict of interest resulting from the Hung Hom Peninsula affair. New World argued that they hired Leung in good faith, after the government had given clearance. New World announced in the early hours of 16 August that the parties had agreed to rescind the contract.


### Avenue of Stars

The company has managed the Avenue of Stars for 11 yearsʷʰᵉⁿ?, and its contract is due to expire. It was announced that the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong government would redevelop and expand the avenue jointly with the company. The Hong Kong government declared that the enhancement project would contain limited commercial appeal, and no luxury shops or high-end restaurants would be added. The walkway, very popular with tourists, was closed off for three years while the expansion was undertaken.

The decision to award the contract for the redevelopment to the company without putting it out to tender, on the justification that the project was non-profit, sparked controversy locally. Residents' groups and other development companies owning properties adjacent to the walk expressed discontent, whilst the LCSD claimed that consultations with the local district council had been favourable. In an apparent attempt to de-fuse the public furore at the apparent collusion between government and big business, the government promised a public consultation.


### **Chubby Hearts**

HK$7.8 million was granted by the Hong Kong Mega Arts and Cultural Events Committee to host in February 2024 Chubby Hearts by British designer Anya Hindmarch, who has a shop in K11 Musea, a mall founded by New World Development.
