Yale School of Management


# Yale School of Management



The **Yale School of Management** (also known as **Yale SOM**) is the graduate business school of Yale University, a private research university in New Haven, Connecticut. The school awards the Master of Business Administration (MBA), MBA for Executives (EMBA), Master of Advanced Management (MAM), Master's Degree in Systemic Risk (SR), Master's Degree in Global Business & Society (GBS), Master's Degree in Asset Management (AM), and Ph.D. degrees, as well as joint degrees with nine other graduate programs at Yale University. The Yale School of Management is one of six Ivy League Business Schools.

The school conducts education and research in leadership, behavioral economics, operations management, marketing, entrepreneurship, organizational behavior, and other areas. The EMBA program offers focused study in healthcare, asset management, or sustainability.

The school also offers semester-long student exchange programs with HEC Paris, IESE, the London School of Economics, the National University of Singapore Business School, and Tsinghua University. Students may also propose a quarter- or semester-long exchange program with any of the 25 other schools of the Global Network for Advanced Management.


## History

Beginning in the 1950s, Yale University started to expand coursework offerings in business and organization management. A precursor to the School of Management, the Department of Industrial Administration, grew out of the Labor and Management Center, and conferred the master in industrial administration from 1958 through 1973. Professors Thomas Holmes, Chris Argyris, and David Votaw were instrumental in founding the MIA. In 1971, Yale University received a donation establishing a program in management from Frederick W. Beinecke, PhB 1909. Arriving in 1976, the first class of the two-year program that awarded a master's degree in public and private management (MPPM) attended the campus on Hillhouse Avenue.

Historically known for its strength in studies regarding nonprofits and the public sector, the school's focus began to evolve and changed its name to the Yale School of Management in 1994. Shortly thereafter in 1999, the School began offering a master of business (MBA) degree and discontinued the MPPM degree.

Yale SOM launched an executive MBA program for healthcare professionals in 2005, and in 2006, it introduced its mandatory, team-taught "Integrated Curriculum" for all MBA students.

In 2014, Yale SOM enrolled its first class of students in an expanded MBA for Executives program, offering the Yale MBA integrated core along with advanced study in asset management, healthcare, or sustainability. That same year in January, SOM's new building, Edward P. Evans Hall, opened at 165 Whitney Avenue, one block away from the old campus on Hillhouse Avenue.

Foster and Partners, the firm chaired by Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureate Lord Norman Foster ARCH ’62, designed the building with Gruzen Samton stated as the Architect of Record. Edward P. Evans Hall houses technology-enabled classrooms, faculty offices, academic centers, and student and meeting spaces organized around an enclosed courtyard.


## Academics


### Integrated Curriculum

For the 2006–07 academic year, the school introduced its "Integrated Curriculum", an effort to move away from the typical "siloed" teaching approach to a more cross-disciplinary curriculum. A multi-year, in-depth case study of the curricular reforms undertaken by Yale SOM demonstrated that while most business school curricular reforms happen at the fringe of the curriculum, mostly as fad, Yale SOM reforms were effective, extensive and substantial (Ashish Jaiswal, 2015). The new curriculum is composed of two components: foundational skills classes in a program called "Orientation to Management" that take place during the first semester of the MBA program and a set of classes called "Organizational Perspectives" that take place during the second through fourth quarters of the first academic year and are case- and lecture-focused courses that decompose business components into the perspectives of different stakeholders.


#### Orientation to Management

The Orientation to Management is the first segment of the curriculum, which introduces students to core concepts and business skills. The constituent courses include Managing Groups and Teams, Global Virtual Teams, Basics of Accounting, Probability Modeling and Statistics, Basics of Economics, Modeling Managerial Decisions, and Introduction to Negotiation.


#### Organizational Perspectives

Organizational Perspectives is a series of interdisciplinary, team-taught master classes that make up the majority of required MBA courses at SOM. These courses include Employee, Innovator, Operations Engine, Sourcing and Managing Funds, Competitor, Customer, Investor, The Global Macro-economy, and State and Society. The final Organizational Perspectives course, the Executive, focuses on solving a series of case studies involving cross-national or global business challenges and draw on the subject matter taught in the other Organizational Perspectives courses and Orientation to Management skills.

The Organizational Perspectives courses are both in lecture and case format which include cases from multi-media "raw" cases developed by SOM and the Global Network for Advanced Management.


#### Electives

MBA candidates are able to take electives courses at the School of Management commencing during the second semester of the MBA candidates' first year of instruction and during their entire second year of study. These electives include pedagogy drawing from traditional lecture and case-based instruction as well as includes independent reading and research with professors and instructors.

SOM students are also permitted to enroll in the classes offered by other graduate and professional schools and at Yale University including the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Yale Law School, Yale School of Public Health, and undergrad classes at Yale College.


### Global Studies Requirement

MBA candidates are required to complete a Global Studies Requirement prior to graduation. This requirement can be fulfilled a number of ways including an International Experience Course, a Global Network Week, a Global Network Course, The Global Social Entrepreneurship Course, the Global Social Enterprise Course, or a term-long international exchange with a partner school.


### Admission

Admission requirements for the MBA include an earned four-year bachelor's degree from an accredited U.S. institution or the international equivalent, completion of an online application form and essay, GMAT or GRE score, academic transcripts, two professional recommendations, completion of video questions, a behavioral assessment, and a fee. The behavioral assessment is a forced-choice, multiple-choice online module lasting 20–25 minutes that measures inter- and intra-personal competencies associated with business school success.

During the admissions cycle of 2020-2021, for the class of 2023, the MBA class was composed of 20% under-represented students of color, 49% of the US students are students of color, 9% are first-generation college graduates. Matriculating students represented 38 different countries and 176 different academic institutions with 15% having previously earned a graduate degree. Yale SOM is the fourth most selective MBA program with approximately 10.9 applicants competing for each seat.

The program is a specialized master's degree for early- and mid-career students who are interested in the role of central banking and other major regulatory agencies. The *Wall Street Journal* has described the program as a "Degree of Danger" as it focuses on training the "next generation of regulators."


### Master of Management Studies in Asset Management

The Master of Management Studies in Asset Management is a graduate degree program that targets students as well as working professionals. The degree has been developed in parallel with and also runs in collaboration with the Yale Investments Office. The program is highly rigorous and quant-heavy, with Asset Management students taking on advanced PhD level coursework. Strong computer programming, mathematics, and statistics skills coupled with financial modeling and business-related experiences are needed for success in this program. The first cohort of 56 students was welcomed in 2021 with an acceptance rate of approximately 2%, making it the most selective out of all Yale University programs.


### Doctor of Philosophy

The doctoral program (PhD) at Yale SOM is a full-time, in-residence program intended for students who plan scholarly careers involving research and teaching in management. There are five major tracks for PhD students follow at SOM: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Operations, and Organizations and Management. The program is structured so that it can be completed in three to five years. The curriculum for the first two years of PhD candidates is composed of 14 courses, which include two core courses, a social science sequence, an empirical methods sequence, a depth requirement, a breadth requirement, and electives. The program is small and admits only a few students each year; there are currently 51 doctoral candidates in the program. All admitted students are given a full stipend for five years if they satisfy the program's requirements.


### Joint Degrees

The School's joint-degree programs include the MBA/JD with Yale Law School, MBA/MD with Yale School of Medicine, MBA/PhD with Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, MBA/MEM or MF with Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, MBA/MArch with Yale School of Architecture, MBA/MFA with Yale School of Drama, MBA/MDiv or MBA/MAR with Yale Divinity School, MBA/MPH with Yale School of Public Health, and MBA/MA in Global Affairs with the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. Approximately 11% of MBA candidates of the class of 2021 are pursuing dual degrees. Further, in the 2018–2019 academic year, over 1,300 instances of non-SOM students from Yale College and other Graduate and Professional schools registered for SOM classes.


### Global Pre-MBA Leadership

The school offers a Global Pre-MBA Leadership Program that introduces recent college undergraduates from cultural backgrounds that are under-represented in graduate management education to the benefits of an MBA degree.


### Silver Scholars

Initiated in 2001, it was originally open only to Yale undergraduates and was intended to attract more non-traditional MBA candidates with experience outside business and finance. It has since expanded to consider applications from college seniors around the world. Even so, the program remains small. In 2014, SOM admitted only 15 Silver Scholars.

Despite conventional wisdom that MBA programs require previous work experience, Silver Scholars' job placement and scholarship statistics are at least as good as Yale's traditional MBAs. With an approximately 5% admit rate, the program is more selective than the traditional MBA program at Yale, as well as most other early admission MBA programs, including those at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Harvard Business School.

The School offers the Silver Scholars Program to exceptional college seniors with a "combination of Intelligence, Maturity, and Curiosity, who aim to be leaders in their field." It's been called an "alternative" to deferred admissions policies for undergraduate applicants offered by other top MBA programs. It is distinct in that it is one of a very small number of schools to offer an MBA schedule specifically tailored to recent graduates, and the only one to offer a mid-program internship.

Silver Scholars matriculate immediately from undergrad into the School of Management and participate in a one-year, full-time internship after completing the first year of the Integrated Core Curriculum. Following their internship, Silver Scholars return to campus to complete their second year of MBA coursework. At SOM, that second year has minimal requirements, and students may take courses across all Yale's grad schools. In some circumstances, Silver Scholars receive permission to defer their matriculation as a result of fellowships or other extraordinary circumstances or extend their internships by an additional year. A total of 17 Silver Scholars matriculated in the fall of 2019.


## Community
