## Career

At the age of 21, Hirsch dropped out of the University of Bridgeport to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions. In 1969, Hirsch founded Telerate, a global communications network that provided real-time financial information to institutions worldwide. Under Hirsch's leadership as president and chief executive, Telerate became a crucial platform in the financial services industry. By 1990, the company was sold to Dow Jones & Company for over $1.5 billion, marking one of the most successful business deals of its time.

Hirsch later founded Loanet, a firm that specialized in securities-tracking, and served as its chairman. Loanet had become a dominant player in the US securities lending market by the time Hirsch sold to SunGard Data Systems in 2001, bolstering Hirsch’s reputation as an innovator in financial technology.

In December 2013, Hirsch expanded his business portfolio by purchasing *Backstage* magazine and Sonicbids, companies that served the entertainment and music industries. Hirsch's RZ Capital sold its share of these ventures in 2018.

In 1999, Hirsch purchased the Player's Club Restaurant in Wellington, Florida.


## Polo

In 1995, Hirsch co-founded the Bridgehampton Polo Club with his childhood friend Peter M. Brant. The club quickly attracted top players. Hirsch served as its president for many years, until he sold his share to Peter Brant in 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
