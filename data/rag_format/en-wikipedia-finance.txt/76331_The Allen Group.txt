## Projects

MRI Global developed high-tech biocontainment pods measuring 44 feet long and 8 feet tall, designed for use during the epidemic of 2014 Ebola crisis. The pods resemble freight containers and were designed to eliminate the risk of carrying contagious disease patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, additional pods were built to rescue over 300 Americans quarantined on a cruise ship off Japan's coastline. The Allen Group and State Department developed a private-public agreement of $5 million to compensate for this project.
