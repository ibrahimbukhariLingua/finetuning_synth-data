He has been the Wolfson Cheving Fellow at Cambridge University where he specialized in the lifecycles of emerging markets.

Aiyar's news articles in 1991, about the Indian government's pledging of its gold reserves internationally, and its subsequent plans to ship bullion outside the country, is believed to be one of the contributing factors to drawing international and Indian attention to India's impending Balance of Payments economic crisis, and subsequently accelerating efforts toward the 1991 Economic Liberalization of India.
