**Flynn Group LP** is a major operator of franchise restaurants and health clubs. They operate approximately 2,600 franchise locations around the world, primarily Applebee’s, Pizza Hut, Arby's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Panera Bread and Planet Fitness.


## History

The Group was founded in 1999 by Greg Flynn. Its first acquisitions were eight Applebee's franchises. Early financing was provided by Goldman Sachs. Applebees was initially wary of the Flynn Group controlling too many franchises and entered an agreement which limited the Group to 11% of franchises. In 2007, Applebees, then under new ownership, lifted the restriction and sold the Group a number of company owned stores. The Group expanded its Applebees holdings during the Great Recession.

In 2018, the Group reported yearly sales of 2.3 billion. The Group historically avoided hamburger franchises, preferring niches with more differentiation between competitors.

In 2021, the Group acquired 937 Pizza Hut franchises during the bankruptcy of NPC International.

The Group began buying Wendy's franchises in 2021. As of 2024, it operated approximately 5% of Wendy's in the United States with a total of around 300 stores. It is also the master franchisee for Wendy's in New Zealand and Australia. The New Zealand franchisee Wendco (NZ) Ltd. was acquired in 2023 from the Lendich family.

In 2024, they claimed to be the largest operator of franchises in the world. They were also the largest Applebees operator in the world with more than 450 restaurants. Annual sales were approximately $4.5 billion.

In 2024, the Group reportedly explored the sale of a majority stake in the company. However the company quickly denied that they had with Greg Flynn clarifying that they were instead undergoing an equity recapitalization.

In March 2024, in response to claims that the Group had inserted a loophole into California law which would allow Panera franchises to charge lower wages than other restaurants, Gregg Flynn said that all of the Group's restaurants in California would pay 20 dollars an hour or better.
