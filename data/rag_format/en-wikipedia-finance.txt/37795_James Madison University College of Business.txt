## History

The College of Business at JMU was first accredited in the 80s by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. The graduate and undergraduate programs in accounting and business were reaccredited in 2012.


## Academic program

Each student majoring in one of the college's fields must take a core set of classes referred to as the Bachelor of Business Administration Core. At the end of sophomore year, students apply for admission into the College of Business. Admission into the college is competitive and each student must achieve a 2.7 grade point average in the COB prerequisite courses to be considered for admission. These classes are taken throughout the student's career, culminating in a course called COB 300, which is a 12-credit integrated class where the student connects the fundamentals of business in four functional areas: management, marketing, operations, and finance. Students are separated into groups for the task of creating a business plan for a business they create. The grade on the business plan factors into each student's final grades in all four COB 300 courses. The program maintains a "no entitlement mentality" that provides students with "a dose of a practical business environment."


### Accounting

The School of Accounting offers a Bachelor of Business Administration degree and a Master of Science degree in accounting (MSA).

The JMU MSA program is ranked as the number one university in the country in pass rate for the Certified Public Accounting (CPA) exam, according to the 2011 National Association of State Boards of Accountancy report.
