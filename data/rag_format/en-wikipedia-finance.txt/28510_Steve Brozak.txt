Brozak was Chairman and CEO of StormBio, Inc, a development stage biotechnology company focused on the attenuation of Cytokine Storm, specifically in influenza. StormBio was developing therapeutics to minimize the mortality and morbidity resulting from Highly Pathogenic Influenza infections, such as H5N1 and H1N1 influenza strains.

StormBio's approach was to modulate runaway inflammation. Many of the deaths and much of the permanent damage from influenza is caused by a runaway inflammatory process called cytokine storm. It was anticipated that StormBio's therapeutics also could be used to treat a variety of other inflammatory conditions. StormBio was affiliated with leading scientists in the field of inflammation and had in-licensed intellectual property and novel therapeutics directed at treating people in the event of an influenza pandemic.


### Political life

Campaigning for Congress during the 2004 election, Brozak kicked off his campaign with a front-page feature story, "A Marine Jumps Party Lines to Join Democrats in Trenches", in *The Wall Street Journal*, where he gave early warning of the nearly insurmountable challenges faced by the shortage of U.S. troops in Iraq and the need for a modified strategy to subdue insurgency and create a secure nation in Iraq. His campaign focused on the lack of planning for the Iraq war, the strain it placed on our military, and the severe economic repercussions that would ensue—specifically the rise in energy prices. He also stressed the need for unfettered research in stem cells and the need for a fair trade policy with other countries. Brozak was featured in an article in the magazine Salon, which described his campaign as "a referendum on Bush's military folly."

During his Congressional campaign, Brozak was invited to speak during prime time at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, where he criticized the Bush administration for lack of planning prior to the war in Iraq. He was later criticized by bloggers in the Internet publication, *The Weekly Standard* for his strong position against administration partisanship in political appointments at the Pentagon. Brozak was defeated by incumbent Mike Ferguson (Republican) for New Jersey's 7th Congressional District.


### Military career

Brozak is a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps, having served in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Caribbean. He has been attached to units within the United Nations, specifically as a Foreign area officer at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and as a Public Information Officer in the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH). Brozak was also attached to units within NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and has worked with the Inter-American Defense Board.

Brozak resumed active duty service in the Marine Corps immediately after the September 11 attacks in 2001 as Officer in Charge of Mobilization Training Unit NY- 17 in New York City. He later served as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, leading a team to the Middle East to evaluate National Guard and Reserve mobilization. Upon returning from Iraq, his team wrote a report that criticized the lack of troop strength and drain on the reserves caused by the Iraq/Afghanistan deployments. His subsequent active duty assignment before retiring was Chief Spokesperson for OSD's National Committee for the Employer support of the Guard and Reserve in Washington D.C. Brozak participated as a Marine Corps officer representing the Department of Navy and Marine Corps retirees on the SECNAV Retiree Council. Brozak was twice awarded the Navy/Marine Corps Meritorious Service Medal, his last one for his efforts in Washington.
