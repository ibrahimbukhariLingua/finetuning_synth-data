Frankfurt School has a second campus in HafenCity in Hamburg, a study center in Munich and a further study location in Düsseldorf, as well as offices in developing and emerging countries in cities such as Nairobi and Amman.

In recent years, Frankfurt School has steadily improved its rankings in German and international university and business school ranking tables, regularly achieving top positions.


## History

Frankfurt School began life as Bankakademie e.V. (the Banking Academy), which was established in 1957 by Gabler Verlag, a publishing house in Wiesbaden. Initially, the institution focused exclusively on providing professional development programs for bankers. In 1966, the Banking Academy was re-established with regional private banking associations and the association of German cooperative banks as members, and the portfolio of programs was further developed and expanded.

The professional development portfolio grew to include seminars and training programs on specific topics. In the early 1990s, the International Advisory Services (IAS) unit was set up to manage advisory and educational projects in developing and emerging countries all over the world.

In 1990, the institution set up its own university for banking, the *Hochschule* für Bankwirtschaft (HfB), and the first 35 students completed their business administration degrees in 1995. The course's main differentiator was in allowing students to study for a business administration degree while completing an apprenticeship or, if they had already done so, to study alongside a part-time job. A semester and work placement abroad were also a mandatory part of the program right from the start. HfB was granted the right to award doctorates in 2004.

On 17 January 2007, all the Banking Academy business activities, including HfB, were absorbed into Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. Since January 2008, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management has been a non-profit company with limited liability (gGmbH), funded by the foundation of the same name.

In the winter semester of 2017/18, Frankfurt School moved to a new campus on Adickesallee in the Nordend district of Frankfurt. Constructed between 2014 and 2017, the new building stands on the site of Frankfurt's old regional tax office.


## Organization

Frankfurt School's executive board consists of: Professor Nils Stieglitz, President and managing director; Fatma Dirkes, Director and Vice President of International Advisory Services; Karolina Kristic, Chancellor and Chief Financial Officer; Vera Hübner, Chief Marketing Officer; Professor Ansgar Richter, Vice President Academic Affairs; Angelika Werner, Vice President Strategic Relations; Professor Sascha Steffen, Vice President Research.

**International Advisory Services (IAS)**

Since 1992, the International Advisory Services (IAS) unit has been working to improve financial markets and provide easier access to financial resources for low-income segments of local populations. Since then, IAS has extended its commitments: as well as removing financial bottlenecks in various sectors of the financial services industry, IAS also works to improve food security and energy efficiency worldwide. The unit's services are aimed primarily at developing and transition nations, as well as emerging economies. To achieve its objectives, IAS designs, structures and implements advisory, training and educational projects and carries out applied research. To increase the institutional or entrepreneurial capacities of beneficiary institutions, the unit develops approaches tailored to local market conditions.

IAS products and services are grouped into the following areas: Advisory Services, the FS-UNEP Center and the Sustainable World Academy.

The International Advisory Services unit operates through regional offices in Kenya (for Sub-Saharan Africa), Jordan (MENA region), Turkey (Central Asia and Turkey), the United Arab Emirates (Gulf States), Belgium (Europe), through various country offices (including China and India) and from the main Frankfurt campus, supporting and advising partners and customers in more than 130 countries worldwide.

In developing its products and carrying out its services, IAS makes use of far-reaching synergies both between the different clusters and with Frankfurt School's academic and Executive Education departments. IAS also collaborates closely with the independent Frankfurt School Financial Services unit.

Sustainable development is a central goal of all IAS activities, which build on the three pillars of sustainability: society, economy and environment. Frankfurt School's various advisory and training projects contribute to achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

## Additional information

**Admission procedures**

There is no numerus clausus (NC) at Frankfurt School. There is a two-stage application process for admissions. A written application is followed by an Assessment Center in either German or English. The Assessment Center for the Bachelor programs consists of a mathematics test, cognitive tests and a personal interview. English language abilities are also tested during the Assessment Center.

**Quality of teaching**

All taught courses are evaluated by the students. Learning objectives are also defined for the different study programs. These are skills and abilities which the students are expected to have acquired by the end of the course. In this way, the university assesses not only its students, but also its own teaching performance. There are dedicated members of staff for quality management.

**Image and logo**

The logo is an invented symbol incorporating elements of the dollar, euro, yen and pound currency symbols, as well as the mathematical signs for equals/does not equal and integration. The colors were originally dark blue (the color of the Banking Academy) and yellow-orange (the former HfB).

On 30 March 2007, the Maleki Group, a Frankfurt communications agency, filed an objection against the logo, attempting to prevent Frankfurt School of Finance & Management from using the words "Frankfurt" and "Finance" in its name and from using the logo and the blue-yellow color combination.

In a conciliation hearing at the regional court in Frankfurt am Main on 10 November 2009, the presiding judge declared that there was no trademark resemblance between the two symbols. With respect to the color combination, the parties were advised to accept a compromise in which Frankfurt School would cease to use yellow tones in its logo. Frankfurt School has been using the blue and white version since 30 August 2010.

Frankfurt School of Finance & Management adjusted its logo on 1 September 2015, omitting the reference to the HfB Banking Academy ("HfB Bankakademie") and replacing it with the motto "German Excellence. Global Relevance".

**Temporary right to award doctorates**

Since 2005, Frankfurt School has offered a doctoral program that leads to the academic title Dr. rer. pol. The right to award doctorates was originally granted with a time limit, which ended on 31 December 2010. This was extended for five years. The right of the private business school to award doctorates has not been without controversy. The German Council of Science and Humanities noted in an opinion statement in 2010 on Frankfurt School's accreditation that Frankfurt School had been very late in taking energetic steps to support the temporary entitlement it had been granted with adequate research achievements, and expressly excluded the right to award doctorates when it issued the ten-year accreditation. According to the German Council of Science and Humanities, Frankfurt School had neglected to create the institutional and infrastructural conditions required for a research environment. It therefore saw "no sufficient academic basis at the present time for removing the time limit or further extending Frankfurt School's temporary right to award doctorates." Following accusations of plagiarism, the first student to be awarded a doctorate by Frankfurt School, in 2007, was stripped of his title. In 2015, in another review of the school's right to award doctorates, the German Council of Science and Humanities established that "Frankfurt School has the academic standards of a higher-education institution that is on a par with a university." The German Council of Science and Humanities therefore recommended that the State of Hesse extend the existing right of Frankfurt School to award doctoral degrees. Based on the expert opinion of the German Council of Science and Humanities, as part of the "compact process for granting the right to award doctoral degrees", the Hessian Ministry for Science and the Arts announced its final decision to remove the time limits on Frankfurt School's entitlement to award doctoral degrees at the end of 2016.
