Chop My Money


# Chop My Money



"**Chop My Money**" is a song by Nigerian duo P-Square, featuring additional vocals from Akon and May D. The song originally appeared on their fifth studio album, *The Invasion* (2011), and was recorded shortly after P-Square signed a partnership deal with Akon's Konvict Muzik. The music video for "Chop My Money" was directed by Jude Engees Okoye and Ben Marc.


## Background and recording

"Chop My Money" loosely translates to *Spend My Money*. In an interview with Tim Westwood in 2012, the duo were asked about their collaboration with Akon and how it came about. They said they've known Akon for several years and their collaboration with him was an easy transition.


## Live performances

On August 26, 2012, P-Square performed "Chop My Money" at the Love AfroBeats Festival, a concert they headlined. The duo also performed the song to a sold out crowd at the HMV Apollo.
