KDI School of Public Policy and Management


# KDI School of Public Policy and Management



The **KDI School of Public Policy and Management** (**KDI School**, Hangul**:** KDI 국제정책대학원대학교; Hanja: KDI 國際政策大學院大學校) is a government-run graduate school located in Sejong City, South Korea and is affiliated to the **Korea Development Institute** (KDI) and a member of the National Research Council for Economics, Humanities, and Social Sciences. The school was first established in 1997 in Dongdaemun District, Seoul, before moving to Sejong City in 2015 under the South Korean government's actions to establish the city as the de facto administrative capital of the country. The school specializes in fostering international experts in the field of development economics and public policy.

Highly selective, the school takes on a small number of Korean and international students for its Master and Ph.D. programs taught in an institute-style research environment.


## History

The KDI School was established in 1997 under the authorization of the Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development by the Korea Development Institute (KDI), an autonomous economic policy think tank set up by the South Korean government in 1971 to provide research and analysis of economic policy decisions and to monitor South Korea's rapid economic development. As Korea's leading think tank, the Korea Development Institute established the KDI School of Public Policy and Management to educate and develop the next generation of leaders in a rapidly changing global economy.

Throughout its young history, the KDI School of Public Policy and Management has formed partnerships with major institutions and agencies related to South Korea's economic and international activities. In 1999, the school was appointed by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) as a partner institution, sharing knowledge and resources while also supporting a small number of students with scholarships. In 2001, the KDI School was designated as the Korean hub for the World Bank's Global Development Learning Network. More recently, the World Bank has appointed the school with the role of Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) Global Secretariat.

In 2015, the KDI School was relocated from Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun District, to Sejong City. This move was, in part, due to the earlier creation of Sejong City from parts of both South Chungcheong Province and North Chungcheong Province by the Korean government. The Korean government established Sejong City as a de facto administrative capital for South Korea and since construction, over 36 government agencies have relocated from Seoul and other cities to it. As the Korea Development Institute's main mission is to conduct economic research and produce reports for government agencies and private businesses, the move of the KDI School was in coordination with the greater movement of government agencies that the Korea Development Institute works closely with.

Since its establishment, KDI School of Public Policy and Management has developed an innovative educational program focusing on policy and international issues in order to transform mid-career professionals into leaders of their respective fields by equipping them with new knowledge, vision and a global perspective. The curriculum is largely policy-focused and draws upon the wealth of research and resources from the Korea Development Institute. From the institute's history in documenting South Korea's economic growth, the affiliation between the institute and the graduate school has contributed in disseminating Korea's unique economic and social development experiences with the global community. The KDI School has been recognized throughout Korea and the world as a premier institution for research and learning in the field of development studies, development economics, and public policy. The KDI School is counted as 6th Top think tank in Asia, 22nd in the world and 8th best affiliated think tank in the world.

The postgraduate programs have undergone significant change since the school's establishment. While currently offering a Master of Development Policy (MDP), Master of Public Management (MPM), Master of Public Policy (MPP), and a Ph.D. program, in the past, the KDI School has offered a Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Business (MB), Master of Foreign Direct Investment (MFDI), Master in Asset Management (MAM) and an International Master's Program in Practicing Management (IMPM).


## Academic programs

The KDI School of Public Policy and Management offers master's degree programs and a Ph.D. program. The school's curricula draw from accumulated resources of KDI and strive to meet the diverse and professional demands of the global economy.

The Master's programs are divided into full-time and part-time courses. Full-time students are able to complete their coursework by the end of the first year and usually spend the second year working on their research component (thesis, capstone project, or supervised research project). Full-time students are able to graduate in 18 months. Part-time programs operate in a flexible combination of evening and weekend classes. Part-time students may graduate within two years while maintaining their current careers. Both full-time and part-time courses are available for the MDP and MPP programs. All classes are conducted in English.

The Master's programs in the KDI School are divided into three programs:

* **Master of Development Policy Program (MDP)**

Based on KDI's hands-on experience in development policy, the Master of Development Policy (MDP) program examines various socio-economic issues in both theoretical and practical frameworks. The program provides capacity building for international professionals, including government officials, development consultants and regional specialists who wish to contribute to development policy-making. Additional focus falls on fostering professionals in the field of official development assistance (ODA). The goal of the program is to build capacity in designing and implementing economic and social policies in developing countries. It also seeks to train professionals in the field of sustainable development and international development cooperation through the practical combination of development theories and the development policies of South Korea. Students may declare a concentration among seven choices but must take development-focused core courses. In 2017, the MDP program was accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA).

* **Master of Public Policy Program (MPP)**
* **Master of Public Management (MPM)**
* **Concentrations**

For each Master's program, a student must elect one concentration within the focus of their respective program. The current concentrations with their programs denoted in parentheses are:

* Finance and Macroeconomic Policy (MPP)
* Trade and Industrial Policy (MPP)
* Public Finance and Social Policy (MPP)
* Regional Development and Environment Policy (MPP)
* Sustainable Development (MDP)
* International Development (MDP)
* Public Administration and Leadership (MPM)
* Strategic Management (MPM)
* Global Governance and Political Economy (MPM)

Students may declare a second concentration at the end of their studies if they have taken the required amount of credits from the elected second concentration. The second concentration may be from any of the concentrations provided by the school's courses.

* **Ph.D. Program**

The KDI School offers a Ph.D. in public policy with two specializations to choose from: Economic policy and development policy. A one-year residency is required for all students, during which students must take at least 9 classes (27 credits). Afterwards, students are required to pass a comprehensive examination covering their field of study. Pending successfully passing the exam, students must take 9 more credits (36 credits in total), upon which they are required to pass an oral examination in their field of study, followed by the submission of a thesis. Starting from their second year, students have the option of pursuing work and study simultaneously. Ph.D. students at KDI School are encouraged to collaborate with the school's faculty on research projects in order to foster a strong environment where students work closely with professors.

The Ph.D. program contains required courses for the program and also field requirements. Common requirements for the program are two econometrics courses, one microeconomics course, and a course on public policy. Field requirements dictate that students take one microeconomics course and an advanced macroeconomic policy course for the public policy field. For the development policy field, students are required to take two development economics courses.
