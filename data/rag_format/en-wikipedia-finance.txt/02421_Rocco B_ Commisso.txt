## Early life and education

Born in [Marina di Gioiosa Ionica,[Calabria]], Italy, Commisso migrated to the United States at age 12. Commisso attended Mount Saint Michael Academy high school in the Bronx and attended Columbia University on a full undergraduate scholarship where he earned a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering in 1971 from its School of Engineering and Applied Science. He earned an MBA in 1975 from Columbia Business School. He was co-captain of Columbia's varsity soccer team; elected president of the business school student body; and received the business school service award.


## Career

Commisso began his business career at Pfizer Inc. After returning to Columbia and graduating from business school, he spent ten years in the financial industry, initially at Chase Manhattan Bank (now J.P. Morgan Chase). In 1978, he began working with cable companies and other entertainment enterprises as a part of Chase's corporate financing department. He later worked at Royal Bank of Canada, where he led the bank's U.S. lending activities to the media and communications sectors. From 1986 to 1995, he was executive vice president, chief financial officer, and director of Cablevision Industries Corporation. During this time, Cablevision Industries grew from the 25th to the 8th largest cable company in the United States, with around 1.3 million customers at the time of its merger with Time Warner.

Commisso has been the chairman and CEO of Mediacom Communications Corporation since he founded the company in 1995 out of his basement. Initially, Mediacom acquired cable systems in underserved smaller American communities. Commisso took Mediacom public in 2000 after which time it grew to become the 8th largest cable operator in the United States with annual revenues of over $1.6 billion. In March 2011, the company then went private and wholly-owned by Commisso. Since that time Mediacom was named the best cable company in the US in 2016 and in 2009 by *CableFAX magazine*.

Commisso played soccer for the Columbia University Lions in the 1967–1970 period. He is a three time All-Ivy League Honouree. In 1967, Commisso was a member of a freshman squad that finished with an undefeated record of 8-0. Commisso served as co-captain of the 1970 team that went 9-4-0 and made Columbia’s first ever appearance in the NCAA men's soccer tournament.

### New York Cosmos

In January 2017, Commisso purchased a majority ownership stake in the New York Cosmos soccer club and became the club's new chairman. As the owner, he has moved the team's games to MCU Park in Coney Island. At the time, both the team and its league (the North American Soccer League) were struggling financially, and the move was seen as a sign of support for both. At the time, several of the other bids for the team were to shut down the franchise in order to prevent it from remaining a competitive threat in the league.

In January 2025 during the NASL's antitrust lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) and Major League Soccer (MLS), it was revealed that Commisso had used sockpuppets to attack leaders of both MLS and the USSF where his activity showed that he compared MLS commissioner Don Garber and then USSF president Sunil Gulati to criminals like convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein and Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff, made threats to commentator Alexi Lalas after he criticised the NASL, and compared the North American closed league model MLS has instead of promotion and relegation to prostitution.


### ACF Fiorentina

On June 6, 2019, the purchase of ACF Fiorentina by Commisso was formalized giving him recognition for field development. The purchase was finalized on June 24, 2019. It is believed that Commisso bought Fiorentina for somewhere between $150–200 million.

Commisso is planning to grow Fiorentina's brand in the US market. The club's first venture will see it play in the preseason tournament, the International Champions Cup 2019.

In the spring of 2020, Commisso led a GoFundMe campaign, Forza e Cuore, to raise over $1 million (€872,000) for hospitals in Florence during the Coronavirus pandemic.

In Fall of 2023, Rocco B. Commisso Viola Park, a state-of-the-art sports training center hosting the ACF Fiorentina men's, women's, youth teams, opened in Bagno a Ripoli in the outskirts of Florence. This new facility was designed by architect Marco Casamonti, and spans over 31 hectares.
