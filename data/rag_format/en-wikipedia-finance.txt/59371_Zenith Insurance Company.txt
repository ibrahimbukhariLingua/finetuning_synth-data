## History

Zenith National Insurance Corporation was established in 1949. In 1971, Zenith went public and was listed on the NASDAQ stock market. In 1978, Stanley Zax was hired as Zenith's chief executive officer. In 1987, the company was listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ZNT.

In 2010, Fairfax Financial agreed to buy Zenith in a deal that valued the company at around $1.3 billion US. The deal was negotiated by Fairfax CEO Prem Watsa. A group of Zenith shareholders sought to prevent the sale by going to court, but a court dismissed their claims on April 22, 2010. The combined company became seventh-largest workersâ€™ compensation insurer in California.

In 2015, the company was part of a settlement with the city of San Mateo arising from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
