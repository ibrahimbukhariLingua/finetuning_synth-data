**Allianz France** is a French insurance company, headquartered in Rue de Richelieu, Paris.

*Assurances Générales de France* (the company only refers to itself as **AGF**) is a majority-owned subsidiary of the German multinational Allianz SE. The company provides insurance and financial services in France and internationally.


## History

In 1990, AGF was 72% state owned by the French government. Thus, AGF was among those companies owned in large part by the government in 1993 when passage of a French "denationalization law" took place. AGF was privatized as part of the law's implementation in 1996,¹³⁷ though the French government retained a 57% ownership stake. This level of ownership is consistent with the company remaining a part of French economic infrastructure in a crossed share holding set of relationships with Société Générale and Alcatel-Alsthom. A second such "pole" at the time (1996) consisted of Banque Nationale de Paris, Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez.

The year after privatization, in 1997, AGF was purchased by Allianz of Germany,¹³⁷ part of a period of acquisitions for Allianz from 1992 to 1999 during which it purchased 11 companies.¹¹⁵

As of 2007ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, AGF was traded on the Euronext stock exchange under the symbol "AGF" and represented in the United States under the symbol "ASGFF".
