## Production and release

*Wanda Whips Wall Street* was shot on film using a script as most better quality adult films were in the early 1980s. The movie showed up edited on venues such as the Washington D.C. areas long defunct Super TV, an early afterhours only form of Pay-per-view. The theatrical release of the film coincided with the beginning of the home video Beta/VHS era and the film enjoyed success and popularity on the home video market and still does on the DVD. Some production locations were used, one such obvious location had Ron Jeremy and Lisa Be in a scene on a boat in the middle of New York Harbor, a scene virtually impossible to shoot today with nearly every would-be passerby possessing a smartphone with camera.
