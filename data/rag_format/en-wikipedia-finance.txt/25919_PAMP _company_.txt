**PAMP SA (Produits Artistiques Métaux Précieux)** is an independent precious metals refining and fabricating company, and a member of the MKS Group. Established in 1977 in Ticino, Switzerland, PAMP began as a minting facility for small bars and an alloy specialist for jewelry and watchmaking. It now offers services from mining to bullion production, producing bars from 1 gram to 12.5 kilograms, along with custom minting for private companies and government mints.
