Differentiated Bertrand competition


# Differentiated Bertrand competition



As a solution to the Bertrand paradox in economics, it has been suggested that each firm produces a somewhat differentiated product, and consequently faces a demand curve that is downward-sloping for all levels of the firm's price.

An increase in a competitor's price is represented as an increase (for example, an upward shift) of the firm's demand curve.

As a result, when a competitor raises price, generally a firm can also raise its own price and increase its profits.


## Calculating the differentiated Bertrand model

* q₁ = firm 1's demand, \*q₁≥0
* q₂ = firm 2's demand, \*q₁≥0
* A₁ = Constant in equation for firm 1's demand
* A₂ = Constant in equation for firm 2's demand
* a₁ = slope coefficient for firm 1's price
* a₂ = slope coefficient for firm 2's price
* p₁ = firm 1's price level pr unit
* p₂ = firm 2's price level pr unit
* b₁ = slope coefficient for how much firm 2's price affects firm 1's demand
* b₂ = slope coefficient for how much firm 1's price affects firm 2's demand
* q₁=A₁-a₁\*p₁+b₁\*p₂
* q₂=A₂-a₂\*p₂+b₂\*p₁

The above figure presents the best response functions of the firms, which are complements to each other.


## Uses

Merger simulation models ordinarily assume differentiated Bertrand competition within a market that includes the merging firms.
