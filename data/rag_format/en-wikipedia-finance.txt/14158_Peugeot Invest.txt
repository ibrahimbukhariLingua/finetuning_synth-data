# Peugeot Invest



**Peugeot Invest S.A.** is the listed holding company of the Peugeot family.

It is incorporated in France, listed on Euronext Paris, and controlled through the privately held company *Établissements Peugeot Frères S.A.*, which represents the interests of the Peugeot family. Peugeot Invest was founded in 1929 as the *Société Foncière Financière et de Participations*, later renamed **FFP**.


## History


### Founding and growth

In 1929 the company was created by the Peugeot family as a family investment company, the *Société Foncière Financière et de Participations*. From the outset, the company built on the legacy of the Peugeot brothers, who founded the Peugeot automobile manufacturer in 1810. The Peugeot family is one of the historic shareholders of Stellantis (and previously of PSA Group). Drawing on its industrial experience, the company has developed an investment activity in diversified assets, consisting mainly of direct minority holdings, private equity vehicles, co-investments and real estate.

In 1966 the family group companies were reorganised, with FFP becoming the main shareholder in Peugeot SA.

In 1989 the company was listed on the Nancy Stock Exchange. For several years, it remained focused on its stake in PSA Peugeot Citroën. By the early 2000s, it had only €200m of assets outside the automobile manufacturer.

In 2002 Robert Peugeot (1950–), great-grandson and namesake of the founder of the PSA Group, took over as head of the FFP family investment company and began an ambitious diversification strategy. Since then, it has diversified considerably under his leadership, leading the holding company to take long-term minority stakes in groups such as SEB, Taittinger, Lisi, Zodiac Aerospace and Sanef.


### Restructuring as Peugeot Invest

In May 2020 Bertrand Finet was appointed managing director of Peugeot Invest, continuing the diversification strategy led by Robert Peugeot. In March 2023, FFP announced a change in its general management and the departure of Bertrand Finet. In September 2020, FFP and *Établissements Peugeot Frères* transferred all their shares in the PSA Group to their joint subsidiary "Maillot I", which in February 2021 became "Peugeot 1810", 76.5%-owned by the FFP and 23.5%-owned by *Établissements Peugeot Frères*. This subsidiary then owns 7.2% of Stellantis, which was created by the merger between PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in January 2021.

On 22 February 2021 FFP announced its name change to "Peugeot Invest". At 31 December 2021, 80% of Peugeot Invest's capital was held by the Peugeot family through *Établissements Peugeot Frères*, with 20% corresponding to free float. The net asset value was €5.9 billion. Today, the company is listed on Compartment A of Euronext Paris and remains 80% owned by family members, via *Établissements Peugeot Frères*.

In 2023 the company invested in the Anglo-French investment bank Rothschild & Co, and sold its stake in Groupe SEB the following year.

Prior to the merger of PSA Group with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, its main asset (28% at 30 June 2020) was a 9% stake in the capital of PSA (the family held around 13% of the capital through various channels). The remaining assets (72%) are part of a diversification strategy implemented since 2003, which consists of decorrelating the Peugeot Invest portfolio by investing in a variety of sectors and geographical areas.


#### Forvia

When PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Stellantis' stake in Faurecia (now Forvia) was reduced from 46.3% to 39% and then redistributed to its own shareholders at the beginning of 2021. Peugeot 1810 held 3.14% of the capital as at 27 March 2021.
