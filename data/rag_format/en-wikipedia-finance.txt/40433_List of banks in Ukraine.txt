## Virtual banks

Virtual bank (also often referred to as "Mobile bank", "Digital bank" or "neobank") in Ukraine is currently a type of bank that operates on the basis of a license from another (parental) bank. Such banks position themselves in the market as separate banking institutions with a different marketing and pricing policy, but from a legal standpoint, they continue to operate on behalf of the parent institution, so their financial condition remains completely dependent on the financial condition of the parent bank.
