## Biography

Born in January 1965, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Henri Beaufour is the son of Albert Beaufour, who died in 2000, and the grandson of Dr. Henri Beaufour, founder of the Ipsen group.

He holds a bachelor's of arts from Georgetown University (Washington, D.C.).

When Albert Beaufour died in 2000, the 76% of the capital held by the family was divided between the three brothers and sisters. One of the daughters, VÃ©ronique Beaufour, sold her share, representing 6% of the capital. Anne and her brother Henri Beaufour thus control 57% of the Ipsen group, and both sit on the Board of Directors of Ipsen and Mayroy, the Ipsen controlling holding company. Their share in Ipsen is still 52% in 2020.

In 2018, his fortune is estimated at Euro 3 billion.
