## History

mytaxi was founded in 2009 by German entrepreneurs Niclaus Mewes and Sven Külper. Later that year, the pair founded the legal entity behind mytaxi, Intelligent Apps. In September 2014, Daimler acquired mytaxi's parent company, Intelligent Apps, entering the vehicle for hire market.

In 2016, the German e-hailing app mytaxi merged with Hailo. Founded in London in 2011, Hailo was a British technology platform that matched taxi drivers and passengers through its mobile phone application. The merger between mytaxi and Hailo made mytaxi the largest licensed taxi e-hailing operator.

Following regulatory approval in February 2019, Daimler and BMW announced the €1bn mobility joint-venture; the parent company is known as YOUR NOW which also operates SHARE NOW, ReachNow, Park Now and CHARGE NOW. On 1 July 2019, myTaxi was rebranded to FREENOW and has transformed from a taxi app into a fully integrated multi-mobility platform.

In January 2021, FREENOW announced a €6 million investment to fund its 14,000 drivers in Ireland with home charging kits to encourage them to switch to electric vehicles. Overall, FREENOW wants to allocate more than EUR 100 million of resources in the coming five years to push the electrification of its rides across Europe.
