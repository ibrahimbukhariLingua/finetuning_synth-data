### Entrepreneurial Journey

At the age of 19, Zaw Win Shein completed his first academic year in Chinese Major at the Yangon University of Foreign Languages, Myanmar.

In 2007, in order to promote his family-owned business, Zaw Win Shein formed his first company, Ayeyar Hinthar Trading Co., Ltd, exporting high-quality rice and other agricultural products abroad. Thus, helping to increase and distribute domestic products. The abolition of the quota system for Rice Export and the replacement of competitive market practices by the Government in 2007, helped the growth of the export business through Ayeyar Hinthar Trading Co., Ltd. Within 3 years, Ayeyar Hinthar Trading Co., became one of the top exporters for rice generating gross revenue of approximately US$60 million to US$100 million per year.

An international trading wing was set up in 2009 to export other agricultural products such as sugar, beans, and pulses from Myanmar.
