In October 2020, it purchased Asda from Walmart for £6.8 billion, as part of a consortium with Zuber and Mohsin Issa, with whom it owns EG Group.

In August 2022, TDR and brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, co-owners of petrol station operator EG Group and Asda acquired the 129 The Co-operative Group's petrol court stations for a sum of £600 million.

in February 2024, TDR and Andy Bond announced that they would acquire a majority stake in the pet chain Jollyes.


## Investigations

In December 2020, following a referral from the EU Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into the £6.8 billion Asda joint takeover by brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR, joint owners of petrol forecourt firm EG Group, probing for significant adverse effects on competition in the UK.

In October 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority began an investigation into the completed acquisition by Asda, TDR and brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, of petrol forecourt business from the Co-operative Group.

TDR's Managing Partner, Gary Lindsay and COO and Deputy General Counsel appeared before a Parliamentary select committee in January 2024 to answer questions about the company's debt burden with regard to Asda and Stonegate in particular.

The chair of the select committee, Labour’s Liam Byrne, said that “The private equity model creates big tax incentives for people to load up some of these companies with a lot of debt.” Byrne added, “When it comes to Stonegate then, you have lost Manjit Dale from the board, you have debt of £2.5 billion, you have a debt increase of about £650 million, and you have significant loans maturing this year. It is not completely clear that the cash in the business can cover that interest payment at the moment.”
