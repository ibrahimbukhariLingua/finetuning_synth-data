National Social Security Fund (Uganda)


# National Social Security Fund (Uganda)



The **National Social Security Fund** (NSSF) (also **NSSF Uganda**), is a quasi-government agency responsible for the collection, safekeeping, responsible investment, and distribution of retirement funds from employees of the private sector in Uganda who are not covered by the Government Retirement Scheme. Participation for both employers and employees is compulsory. The Uganda National Social Security Fund is the largest pension fund in the countries of the East African Community, with total assets of USh18.58 trillion (approx. US$4.981 billion), as of June 2023.


## History

In February 2009, the President of Uganda fired the minister of finance, whose ministry supervises the activities of NSSF. Also terminated were the managing director of the NSSF. A new board of directors and a new management team were appointed in 2009.

In late 2010, NSSF underwent a restructuring process aimed at making it more efficient, competitive, and responsive to the needs of its members. It was then poised to provide a wide range of social security products and be the lead institution for domestic capital formation and deepening the financial sector. Analysts in the country said in 2013 that the NSSF had become a leading player in the country's economy.

In November 2024, NSSF management introduced a voluntary savings plan called *The Smartlife Savings Plan*, available to Ugandan citizens, legal non Ugandans and refugees. One has to be at least 16 years of age and authorized to work in Uganda. The minimum investment is USh 5,000 (approx. US$1.37).

## Pension Towers

Beginning in the early 2000s, NSSFU has been developing an office complex known as Pension Towers, along Lumumba Avenue, on Nakasero Hill, one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Kampala, Uganda's capital city. The complex consists of three interconnected towers; one central tower of twenty-five stories in height, flanked on either side by a ten-story tower. Roko Construction Company, a Ugandan construction company constructed the four basement floors between 2008 and 2012, but failed to qualify for further works on the project. Three Chinese firms are in a final bidding process to complete the construction, between 2012 and 2015. Construction costs for the complex are estimated at UGX:260 billion. When finished, the three towers will contain in excess of 59,410 square metres (639,500 sq ft) in office space. Parking for over 500 vehicles will be provided in the development.


## City House Jinja

Jinja City House is owned by the Uganda National Social Security Fund (NSSF), who developed the building, between 2015 and 2018. The building houses the NSSF offices in Jinja and the remaining space is rented out to qualified businesses and corporations. The mixed use building consists of 1,500 square metres (16,146 sq ft) on four floors, of which 1,200 square metres (12,917 sq ft) are rentable. NSSF will occupy the remaining 300 square metres (3,229 sq ft).
