The "Crude Flexibility Project" (CFP) has made significant progress in 2020, with the ADNOC having a 73% project delivery which is constantly increasing from the refining capabilities in Ruwais. The CFP is to be completed in mid-2022, allowing the ADNOC to process up to 420,000 bpsd (Barrels per Stream Day) of the heavier grades of crude oil at the Ruwais refinery, which processes in total 840,000 bpsd. The necessary physical infrastructure required for the CFP has been put into place, only the structural elements such as 2 new fractionators and 24 atmospheric residue desulfurizer reactors were installed in the months of June and July 2020.
