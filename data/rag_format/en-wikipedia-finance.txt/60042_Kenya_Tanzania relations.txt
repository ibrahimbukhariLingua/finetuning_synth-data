Kenya–Tanzania relations


# Kenya–Tanzania relations



**Kenya–Tanzania relations** are bilateral relations between Tanzania and Kenya. Tanzania is a partner of Kenya in many areas, particularly trade, security (military), education, agriculture and energy.


## History

The first high commissions of Kenya in Tanzania and vice versa were opened after the independence of Kenya. However, after the breakup of the EAC in 1977 both countries severed diplomatic ties. The breakup of the first EAC which was founded in 1967 was brought about by ideological differences between Tanzania and Kenya. As it was during the cold war African countries were making decisions on whether to become socialist or capitalist. Kenya's leader Kenyatta was intent on making sure that Kenya wouldn't become socialist and Kenya stuck to capitalism. Tanzania on the other hand championed for Ujamaa, a major African socialist policy.

Tanzania and Kenya resumed diplomatic ties in 1983. By that time, a lot of factors were slowing the idea of Ujamaa in Tanzania among them the war with Uganda and many other social factors.

Today both countries enjoy healthy relations. Both countries are inhabited by the world's largest Swahili speaking populations, Swahili is the official and national language in both countries. Kenya and Tanzania share a lot of cultural similarities.
