## History

Peñoles' history begins in 1887, with the mining concession of certain mines located within the Sierra de Peñoles in the state of Durango and the foundation of the Compañía Minera de Peñoles under the regime of President Porfirio Díaz.

From 1890 to 1960 the company suffered several mergers, fusions and acquisitions with others mining companies. During this time the company was owned by different shareholders, among them some from the United Kingdom, United States and Germany.

During the decade of 1960 to 1970 the Mexican mining industry was "mexicanized" and therefore Mr. Raúl Bailleres acquired the majority of the company shares, after that the company received the name of Industrias Peñoles.
