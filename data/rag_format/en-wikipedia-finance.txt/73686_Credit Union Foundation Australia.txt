## History

Cufa Ltd was created in 1971 as the development agency of the Australian Credit union Movement. Cufa was previously a subsidiary company of Customer Owned Banking Association (COBA), became an independent entity 1 July 2013, when Cufa Ltd became the holder of the two shares in Credit Union Foundation Australia Pty Ltd.

As a subsidiary company, Cufa's members were the members of the Australian credit union movement. As an independent entity, Cufa now has its own membership through Cufa Ltd. Cufa Ltd also has its own constitution.


## Current Work

Cufa's focus is on promoting financial inclusion and increasing financial literacy and improving economic livelihoods. Cufa develops community access to affordable financial services working cooperatively from the grass-roots through to government levels, building capacity in emerging financial cooperative movements to create sustainability, improve lives, and relieve poverty.


### Building Community-Owned Financial Institutions

Cufa's Credit Union Outreach project is supporting existing community owned financial institutions in Cambodia and Timor-Leste to have improved sustainable financial management, governance and operational processes by providing tailored support and training programs.

Through tailored training the Project is assisting community owned financial institutions to help develop their operational practice across governance, savings and membership mobilisation, managing delinquency, roles and responsibilities of committee members, loan application practices, book keeping skills, micro-enterprises, dividend calculations and monthly interest allocations.

Cufa's Credit Union Development project helps to build, develop and promote community owned financial institutions in rural Cambodian and Timorese communities that previously had no access to financial services. The project works in collaboration with communities to establish community owned financial institutions based on the principles outlined by the International Credit Union Movement, codified by the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU).


### Financial education

Cufa's financial education programs focus on teaching children and adults about having good money skills through an understanding on how to manage household expenses, savings and creating profitable micro-businesses.


### Micro-business development
