2008 United States federal budget


# 2008 United States federal budget



The 2008 United States Federal Budget began as a proposal by President George W. Bush to fund government operations for October 1, 2007 – September 30, 2008.
The requested budget was submitted to the 110th Congress on February 5, 2007.

The government was initially funded through a series of four temporary continuing resolutions. Final funding for the Department of Defense was enacted on November 13, 2007 as part of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, while the remaining departments and agencies were funded as part of an omnibus spending bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, on December 26, 2007.
