Algeria–European Union relations


# Algeria–European Union relations

## History

Algeria was a part of the European Community during its incorporation within the French Republic, when it was known as L'Algérie Française and was considered an integral part of the Metropolitan France. Following its independence from France in 1962, the legal status of its relationship with the EEC was unresolved, as the text of the Treaty of Rome continued to refer to Algeria by name as an overseas territory of France to which the treaty provisions applied. In 1976 the European Economic Community signed a treaty with Algeria, formalizing their relationship as a neighboring entities.

The EU's main exports to Algeria are machinery (22.2%), transport equipment (13.4%), agricultural products (12.8%), chemicals (12.8%) and iron and steel (10.2%).
