STOCK Act


# STOCK Act



The **Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012** (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 112–105 (text) (PDF), S. 2038, 126 Stat. 291, enacted April 4, 2012) is an Act of Congress designed to combat insider trading. It was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 4, 2012. The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading, by members of Congress and other government employees. It confirms changes to the Commodity Exchange Act, specifies reporting intervals for financial transactions.

Originally written and introduced by Washington Congressman Brian Baird, the STOCK Act gained popularity following a *60 Minutes* segment on congressional insider trading in 2011, after which Republican Senator Scott Brown and Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand reintroduced bills to combat the practice. In February 2012, the STOCK Act passed in the Senate by a 96–3 vote; the only no votes were senators Jeff Bingaman, Richard Burr, and Tom Coburn. Later the House of Representatives passed it by a 417–2 vote. The bill was supported heavily by vulnerable incumbents and signed into law by President Obama. According to the current United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics, "A member, officer, or employee of the Senate shall not receive any compensation, nor shall he permit any compensation to accrue to his beneficial interest from any source, the receipt or accrual of which would occur by virtue of influence improperly exerted from his position as a member, officer, or employee."


## Background

The law is yet another addition to the series of policy created to mandate and regulate the transactions of securities. The Securities Act of 1933 was the first policy created to protect the sale of primary security transactions by companies. Also known as the "Truth in Securities" law, it paved the way to provide investors with more protection and a fair opportunity for their liquid assets. Congress saw the lack of information provided to investors was a large disadvantage to investors and derailed their interest, causing a lack of liquidity in the market during the recovery. It also laid out examples and identified situations of fraudulent activity that has been previously committed by companies. In addition, it provided guidelines for companies with registered publicly held securities to publicly disclose annual and quarterly reports to properly educate their individual investors.

The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 was established decades later to create a code of ethics as a means for political representatives to abide by. Amongst other regulations placed, this piece of legislature also had large implications on the effects of information asymmetry and was intended to create honest and just security transactions. These acts were necessary to prevent fraudulent activity imposed by large corporations and political representatives to which were very capable of hiding information that would benefit their company or their applicable assets.


## Summary

The STOCK Act is an original bill to prohibit members of Congress and employees of Congress from using private information derived from their official positions for personal benefit, and for other purposes. With this bill in place, members of Congress are no longer allowed to use information garnered through official business for personal reasons. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act prohibits members and employees of Congress from using "any nonpublic information derived from the individual's position ... or gained from performance of the individual's duties, for personal benefit". The bill also applies to all employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the federal government. The STOCK Act required a one-year study of the growing political intelligence industry and requires every Member of Congress to publicly file and disclose any financial transaction of stocks, bond, commodities futures, and other securities within 45 days on their websites, rather than once a year as was required previously. The Act also requires members of Congress and Executive branch officials to disclose the terms of mortgages on their homes, prohibits them from receiving special access to initial public stock offerings, and denies federal pensions to members of Congress who are convicted of felonies involving public corruption. The bill is divided into nineteen sections. The following summary was written by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of the Library of Congress, which serves Congress.

## Reception

Overall, the STOCK Act has garnered positive support from both houses of Congress. However, guarded optimism has been expressed by politicians such as Eric Weissmann. Weissmann, a candidate for Congress in Colorado's 2nd Congressional District, recently claimed that STOCK was long overdue and that "The passage of the STOCK Act by both the House and Senate is a good first step in deterring these abusive practices, but doesn't go far enough to protect the American people from members of Congress who chose to act with self-interest over public good."

Other examples of positive support for STOCK include President Obama who upon signing the bill reassured that congressional members must play by the same rules as regular citizens. Obama regards the STOCK act as a way to monitor congressional activity and create transparency within the branch. He spoke to this point by adding, "It's the notion that the powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else. ... If we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply to our elected officials."

As a result of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there are new calls to expand or reform the STOCK Act. There have been several reports by various prominent news agencies of alleged violations of the STOCK act by members of Congress. Analysis in 2021 by Business Insider shows fifty four members of Congress, executive officials, and numerous staffers violating the STOCK Act. As of 2021, in the approximately nine month period up to September 2021, Senate and House members disclosed 4,000 trades worth at least $315 million of stocks and bonds. The list of alleged violations include members from both parties. A majority of respondents supported a ban for members of Congress to hold individual stocks as shown in a recent poll conducted in March 2020. Support for the ban appears to be bipartisan and ideologically agnostic as the demographic representation of the poll results present.

The real world effectiveness of the STOCK Act at curbing insider trading is up for debate. Insider trading laws which already existed to stop such practices lack specific definitions making them difficult to enforce, the STOCK Act attempts to rectify this but critics argue it does not do enough. The enforcement of the STOCK Act is left up to the executive branch which may be reluctant to pursue cases against the legislature because of concerns regarding the separation of powers and the inherent imbalance this may present if executive were to abuse the law. This can lead to a situation where the most egregious cases are pursued while milder cases which may be difficult to define are not pursued. A recent study did not find a difference between the expected returns of public equities owned by public officials tracked between 2012 and 2020 when compared to randomly choosing stocks. Suggesting that public officials either did not engage in insider trading or if they did, it did not result in better returns than if they had chosen stocks randomly.


## Amendment

The STOCK Act was modified on April 15, 2013, by S. 716. This amendment modifies the online disclosure portion of the STOCK Act, so that some officials, but not the President, Vice President, Congress, or anyone running for Congress, can no longer file online and their records are no longer easily accessible to the public. In Section (a)2, the amendment specifically does not alter the online access for trades by the President, the Vice President, Congress, or those running for Congress. The reasoning for this change was to prevent criminals from gaining access to the financial data and using it against affected persons. The amendment also eliminated the requirement for the creation of searchable, sortable database of information in reports, and the requirement that reports be done in electronic format, rather than on paper. This bill was introduced by Senator Harry Reid on April 11, 2013. It was considered by the Senate and passed by unanimous consent. In the House, S.716 received only 14 seconds of discussion before being passed by unanimous consent.

The main provision that was repealed would have required about 28,000 senior government officials to post their financial information online, something that had been strongly criticized by federal government employee unions. A report by the National Academy of Public Administration, published in March 2013, said that the provision could threaten the safety of government employees abroad, as well as make it difficult to attract and retain public sector employees.
