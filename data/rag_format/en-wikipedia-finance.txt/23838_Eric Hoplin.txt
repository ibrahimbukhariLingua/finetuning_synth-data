Hoplin is a former Republican organizer and official who was elected Deputy Chairman of the Republican Party of Minnesota in June 2005 and served until 2007. Prior to that he was elected Chairman of the College Republican National Committee (CRNC) in July 2003 and served until 2005. Hoplin focused on strengthening the national College Republican organization's political influence during his tenure as Chairman. His administration was the subject of a fund-raising scandal involving direct mail solicitations from senior citizens by Response Dynamics, Inc.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Hoplin is credited and widely lauded for completing the task begun under predecessor Scott Stewart of terminating the decade old contract with Response Dynamics, Inc.

In 2004, Hoplin and his administration organized a program of paid field staffers to recruit College Republicans across the country, helping to provide volunteers for numerous Republican campaigns, including the successful reelection effort of President George W. Bush.

Hoplin chose not to run for reelection as CRNC Chairman in 2005, pursuing the post of Deputy Chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party instead. He was elected to that position in June 2005. Hoplin was succeeded as CRNC Chairman by Paul Gourley of South Dakota in a highly contested election against Michael Davidson. The contest gave rise to a rapid but short-lived proliferation of CRNC related blogs, most of which have since ceased publishing updated content.

In March 2007, Hoplin announced that he would not seek re-election to the position of Deputy Chairman of the Republican Party of Minnesota. He gave his reasons as wishing to continue a further education and work abroad.

Hoplin serves on the board of the Trust for the National Mall.
