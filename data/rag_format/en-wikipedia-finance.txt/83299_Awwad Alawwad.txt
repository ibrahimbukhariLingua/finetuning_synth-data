Dr. Alawwad previously served as an adviser for economic and financial affairs in the Office of the Crown Prince (2013), as a consultant for the Governor of Riyadh and as Vice Governor for Investment Affairs at Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority – SAGIA (2003).

During his tenure, SAGIA established a more liberal ecosystem for investment in Saudi Arabia. It implemented the Investment Environment Obstacles Program, designed to identify and resolve barriers to foreign investment, and promote an open and transparent environment in business within the Kingdom. Dr. Alawwad was responsible for establishing the National Competitiveness Centre, which spearheaded the national ‘10 by 10’ program to establish Saudi Arabia as one of the Top 10 most competitive economies globally.

As part of these efforts, Alawwad chaired the Saudi negotiation team for bilateral investment treaties and was acting leader of the Saudi team overseeing disputes elevated to the WTO. Furthermore, he represented Saudi Arabia on the OECD-MENA Committee on Investment and Arab Investment Promotion Association. He was the deputy chief of the joint Swiss-Saudi commission and Russian-Saudi commission.

Alawwad's first job in the government was at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) where he was head of financial studies and banking supervision at the Banking Institute.

He also served as a Member of the Saudi Government's Anti-Trust Committee, The Commission for Resolution of Commercial Papers Disputes (United States/Saudi Arabia strategic dialogue), The Saudi American Investment and Trade Board, the regional Arab Investment Authorities Committee and the Arab Investment Court.


### Agnes Callamard Accusations

In 2020, Alawwad was uncovered as allegedly having twice threatened the life of outgoing United Nations investigator Agnes Callamard who told The Guardian on that a senior Saudi official had threatened to have her "taken care of" at a "high-level" meeting if she wasn't kept in check following her damning findings into MBS direct connection to the murder of Khashoggi. The UN later confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday that Callamard's remarks were accurate.

Alawwad has denied the allegations and has stated that he rejects "this suggestion in the strongest terms" and that he never "would have desired or threatened any harm upon a UN-appointed individual or anyone in that matter". He added: "I am disheartened that anything I have said could be interpreted as a threat".
