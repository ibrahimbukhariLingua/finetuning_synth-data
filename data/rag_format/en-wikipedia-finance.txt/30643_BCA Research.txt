## History

BCA was founded in 1949 by A. Hamilton Bolton in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Bolton was known for his work on the Elliot Wave Theory, and he published *Money and Investment Profits*, a book on investments and the business cycle, just prior to his death in 1967. He was succeeded by J. Anthony Boeckh, who led the company from 1968 to 2001.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ During that time, Bolton's original work on supercycles was refined into what BCA calls the "debt supercycle."

Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC bought Metal Bulletin along with BCA Research in 2006.
