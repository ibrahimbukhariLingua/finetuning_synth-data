## Description

The bank is headquartered in Chiba Prefecture, which lies adjacent to Japan's capital Tokyo on Tokyo Bay and has one of the most important industrial concentrations anywhere in Japan. The bank's strategy is to expand its branch network into adjacent prefectures along Tokyo-bound commuter rail lines. It is also putting an emphasis on developing southern Chiba Prefecture as a tourist and resort area, particularly around the city of Kamogawa.

Chiba Bank has a 36.6% market share of lending and a 23.0% share of all deposits in the prefecture. Of the bank's network of 173 branches, 154 are within Chiba Prefecture. Chiba Bank is the third-largest of Japan's 64 regional banking groups in terms of total assets. As of March 2008, it had total assets of ¥9.8 trillion and a loan portfolio topping ¥6.6 trillion, which also made it one of the world's 200 largest banks. The bank is one of the few banks that discloses net interest margins (NIM) on their lending.
