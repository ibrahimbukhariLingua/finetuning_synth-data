## History

During the socialist era, Burma had a single registered drug producer, the Burma Pharmaceutical Industry (BPI), whose brand had a solid reputation among domestic consumers. It was renamed the Myanmar Pharmaceutical Factory (MPF) in 1988. MPIE continues to use the BPI trademark, because the brand name remains reputable and highly recognized domestically.


## Operations

MPIE operates 3 state-owned pharmaceutical factories throughout Myanmar:

* Insein, Yangon Region
* Inyaung, Kyaukse Township, Mandalay Region
* Ywathagyi, Hlegu Township, Yangon Region
