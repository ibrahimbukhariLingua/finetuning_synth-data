## Controversies

In 2016, the Competition Commission of Switzerland fined Swisscom and what was known as Cinetrade back then an amount of 71.8 million Swiss francs "for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the provision of national football and ice-hockey coverage between 2002 and 2012". In June 2022, the Federal Administrative Court confirmed the fine. Swisscom argued that it was expanding sport offerings beyond what were offered by rivals.
