## History


### 1989–1999: A construction company

Electronics and Communication Equipment Corporation (SIGELCO), the forerunner of Viettel Group (Viettel), was established on 1 June 1989.

In December 1992, SIGELCO applied for the State's permission for transforming into an Electronics and Communication Equipment Company under the management of the Signal Corps.

On 13 June 1995, the Prime Minister issued Notification No. 3179/DM-DN on the permission for the establishment of Military Electronics and Telecommunications Company. On 14 July 1995, the Minister of National Defense decided to officially change the company's name to Military Electronics and Telecommunications Company, VIETEL in short. At that time, Vietel was the second firm to get a business license for all telecommunications services in Vietnam.

### 2000–2009: A boom in telecommunications services market

On 3 February 2000, Mr. Mai Liem Truc, General Director of the General Department of Post and Telecommunication signed a decision that allowed Vietel to pilot long-distance call services using VoIP technology. For the first time, Vietnam had an operator licensed to supply VoIP. On 15 October 2000, Vietel officially piloted VoIP service for Hanoi - Ho Chi Minh City route with "178 - your saving code" campaign. Vietel was the only VoIP service provider in Vietnam then. The campaign hit the market with a phenomenal success, bringing huge revenue and prestige to Vietel. They continued to expand the service to 62 more provinces (Hanoi and Ha Tay was separate at that time) and broke even only 9 months later.

On 5 December 2001, Vietel launched the international call service using VoIP technology. One year later, they launched the Internet service, connecting internationally at the speed of 2 Mbit/s while costing only one third of the current price.

## Controversies


### Mytel

Following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état and subsequent unrest, it was revealed that Viettel actively does business and assists the State Administration Council in cracking down protesters throughout Mytel, a joint-venture that owned by Viettel and the Tatmadaw, as for the result, its Burmese branch was sanctioned by the United States Treasury Department with assets frozen.

Viettel has also been embroiled, indirectly, for having business ties with the Lebanese diversified investment holdings company M1 Group (owned by the Mikati family's Taha and Najib), a supporter of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East, throughout Mytel. M1 Group has also bought Telenor's Myanmar after the Norwegian company exited due to instabilities.


### Smuggling of US military equipment

In June 2015, Bui Quang Huy, a representative of the Viettel Group in the United States, negotiated with the company EO Imaging to purchase missile tracking equipment using video technology. This type of equipment is used for missile launch systems, however Viettel did not have a license to export this equipment from the United States at that time. In August 2015, Bui Quang Huy bought a vibration damping system for the rocket camera. The selling company advised him to comply with ITAR regulations on arms exports. Mr. Huy replied that he did not have time to ask for permission.

On March 10, 2016, Bui Quang Huy proactively contacted a US company called Sandia Technical Supply LLC to start business negotiations. The employees of this company were undercover agents of the Telecommunications Division. The content of the purchase was 11 Teledyne J402-CA-400 jet engines. These engines are used for the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles developed by Teledyne for the US Navy. On May 9 and 10, 2016, the two sides signed documents, and Viettel's representative transferred a deposit of $20,000 to Sandia even though there was no export license to Vietnam.

On October 26, 2016, Bui Quang Huy was arrested by US police with an indictment stating two serious criminal charges: illegal smuggling and illegal export of defense equipment. The official trial of this case in September 2017 concluded that Bui Quang Huy had pleaded guilty to illegal smuggling. According to the sentencing document, Mr. Huy said that he "worked under the direction of his employer. Viettel asked him to buy this engine and send it back to Vietnam." This employee was fired by Viettel a few weeks earlier. Viettel's internal investigation sent to the US FCC concluded that Bui Quang Huy's acts of smuggling military equipment were entirely his own initiative and not directed by the company.
