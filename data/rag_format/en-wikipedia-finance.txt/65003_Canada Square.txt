# Canada Square



**Canada Square** is a square at Canary Wharf in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, located in London. Canada Square is surrounded by three of the tallest buildings in the United Kingdom, including One Canada Square, which was the tallest building in the United Kingdom from 1990 until late 2010, when it was surpassed by The Shard in the London Borough of Southwark.

The complex is named for Canada by Olympia and York, the original developers of the site owned by the Reichmann family of Toronto.

The complex and the square is served by Canary Wharf Underground station on the Jubilee line and Canary Wharf DLR station on the Docklands Light Railway.
