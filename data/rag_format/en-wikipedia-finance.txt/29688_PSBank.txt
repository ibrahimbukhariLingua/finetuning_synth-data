## Controversies


### Impeachment of Renato Corona

In February 2012, PSBank officials were about to receive a subpoena request in connection with the Impeachment of Renato Corona due to the allegations of a secret US$ account under the name of Renato Corona. The PSBank executives were also asked to bring consumer identification and specimen signature card(s) of the bank account(s) under Corona's name which won ₱1 million in the PSBank Monthly Millions Raffle Promo.


### Pork barrel case

During the senate investigations involving the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, also known as the pork barrel scam, PSBank was one of the domestic banks included in the senate inquiry about the bank accounts of the whistleblowers. Moreover, the bank was included as one of the banks from which Senator Ramon Revilla Jr. and his family, as well as those of Janet Lim-Napoles and her pseudo-NGOs, have utilized to launder the controversial "pork barrel" funds.
