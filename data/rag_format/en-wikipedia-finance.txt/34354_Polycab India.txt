## History

The company's origins date back to 1964 with the establishment of Sind Electric Stores in Lohar Chawl by Thakurdas Jaisinghani, who had moved to Bombay from Pakistan after the Partition of India. This store dealt in various electrical products like fans, lighting fixtures, switches, and wires. By 1975, the company established Thakur Industries and a land was acquired from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation in Andheri, Mumbai, for the construction of a cable and wire manufacturing facility.

In 1983, the company formally entered the electrical goods manufacturing sector with the founding of Polycab Industries by Inder T. Jaisinghani and his brothers. A factory was established in Halol, Gujarat, for the production of PVC insulated wires and cables, copper and aluminum, and bare copper wire.

In May 2008, the company entered into a joint venture with Nexans, a French cable manufacturer. The joint venture, with an initial investment of $37 million, focused on the production of rubber cables for the shipbuilding, railway, and wind power industries. In 2009, the company entered the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) sector, offering services covering the design, engineering, supply, execution, and commissioning of power distribution and rural electrification projects.

In September 2008, the International Finance Corporation, the private investment arm of the World Bank, acquired a 12% stake in Polycab Wires for ₹551.5 crore (US$120 million). This transaction valued the company's cable manufacturing business at ₹4,600 crore (US$1 billion). In 2014, Polycab India Limited expanded its product range to include electric fans, LED lighting and luminaires, switches and switchgear, solar products, and conduits and accessories.

In 2013, the company formed a joint venture with Nexans, holding a 49% stake, to establish production facilities in Gujarat. The investment for this venture amounted to $55 million (approximately ₹320 crore). In 2014, Polycab India Limited expanded its product range to include electric fans, LED lighting and luminaires, switches and switchgear, solar products, and conduits and accessories.

Polycab India Limited established a 50:50 joint venture named Ryker Base with Trafigura (Singapore) in 2016 to strengthen its backward integration for copper. The company acquired full ownership in May 2020 and subsequently, Ryker Base was acquired by Hindalco Industries, a subsidiary of the Aditya Birla Group in November 2021 for ₹323 crore.
