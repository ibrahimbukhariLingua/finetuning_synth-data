## Biography

His parents were clerks, and he and his older sister were the first in his family to attend university. His father died while Salzberg was in high school, so he worked to help his family financially, and continued to live at home and work while he attended college. He is the father of Matt Salzberg co-founder of Blue Apron.

Salzberg earned an undergraduate B.S. degree in accounting from Brooklyn College in 1974, a JD from Brooklyn Law School (1977), and an LLM in tax from the New York University School of Law.

Salzberg joined Deloitte in 1977, and became a partner of Deloitte U.S. in 1985. He was the Chief Executive Officer of Deloitte LLP (United States) from 2007 to 2011.
