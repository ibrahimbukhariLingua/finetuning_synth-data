## Early life

Ruslan Kogan was born to Belarusian parents, and moved with his sister Svetlana and parents to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1989. Kogan grew up in the Elsternwick Housing Commission flats, and started his first business at the age of ten by finding lost golf balls, cleaning them and selling them for $0.50/each to golfers at Elsternwick Golf Course on Saturday mornings. Kogan was interested in technology from an early age, building his first computer at the age of nine. He has started approximately twenty businesses since the age of ten, with Kogan.com being his most recent and most successful venture.

Kogan attended Brighton Secondary College and Melbourne High School before graduating from Monash University with a Bachelor of Business Systems (Information Technology).


## Career

By the age of 23, Kogan had worked at the IT departments of Bosch, GE, Telstra, and was a management consultant at Accenture, until 2006.


### Kogan.com

Kogan started Kogan.com in his parents' Melbourne garage in 2006, aged 23 years. The company rapidly expanded to a broader range of products such as Digital Radios, GPS devices, netbooks, tablets, and video cameras,ˢᵉˡᶠ-ᵖᵘᵇˡⁱˢʰᵉᵈ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ? and in September 2011 began selling complementary products from a range of brands including Apple, Canon, Nikon, Samsung, Motorola and others.

Kogan achieved A$3 million in sales in its third year, followed by A$8 million in year four, A$22 million in year five, A$70 million in year six, and over A$200 million in the seventh year. In 2013 *The Wall Street Journal* speculated that Kogan was worth over US$400 million. More than two million products were delivered by Kogan.com, with daily sales of more than A$1 million.

Having started with no external funding or capital, as of 2011, Kogan.com has grown to become one of Australia's fastest-growing businesses in any industry.


### Open source

Kogan has been a strong believer in open-source solutions for many years, telling Computerworld: "We are huge believers in cloud computing and open-source software. The reasons are simple: open-source software is usually faster, better and has more features." Kogan believes that open-source tablets like Android present a significant challenge to the Apple iPad's dominance of the tablet market, and was the first to launch an open-source tablet in the UK for under £100. In Australia, he launched a laptop running the open-source version of Google's ChromeOS before multinationals like Samsung and Acer could launch their own products.


### Criticism

Kogan is known for using social media to take a swipe at his competitors and has been accused of making 'outlandish statements' through his company's blog about giant retailers like JB Hi-Fi. At Kickstart Forum 2008, in Gold Coast Australia, Kogan was called a 'loudmouthed punk', when he said the future of retail was heading online. On International Transgender Day of Visibility in 2018, Kogan was asked to apologise after a transphobic tweet referencing the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal and Caitlyn Jenner.


## Personal life
