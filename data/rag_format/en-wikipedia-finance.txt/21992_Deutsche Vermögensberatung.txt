## History

In 1975, Reinfried Pohl began to build the company under the name “Kompass Gesellschaft für Vermögensanlagen GmbH“. Pohl had worked for Investors Overseas Services (IOS) from 1967 to 1969, and had been employed by Bonnfinanz from 1970 to 1974. On 1 July 1975, he started out with around 35 of his former Bonnfinanz colleagues. Pohl developed the "all-finance concept" that DVAG is based upon in the 1950s.

“Allgemeine Vermögensberatung AG” (AVAG) was founded in 1976. In 1983, AVAG was renamed “Deutsche Vermögensberatung AG”. Reinfried Pohl's sons Andreas and Reinfried Jr. joined the company's Executive Board in 1984. An Austrian subsidiary, now operating as “Deutsche Vermögensberatung Bank Aktiengesellschaft”, was founded in 1993. Cooperation with Deutsche Bank began in 2001.

In 2003, the company restructured to form “Deutsche Vermögensberatung Holding” headquartered in Marburg. The company entered the Swiss market in 2004 with “SVAG Schweizer Vermögensberatung”. In 2007, DVAG became the exclusive distributor for AachenMünchener insurances and has since managed this segment as an independent subsidiary called “Allfinanz Deutsche Vermögensberatung”. That same year, FVD was integrated into the organization. In 2008, DVAG took over the distribution of Deutsche Bausparkasse Badenia and in 2018 became exclusive distributor for Generali (EVG).


## Business partners

In Germany, the most important partner is the Generali Deutschland group with its member companies such as Badenia Bausparkasse and Advocard Rechtsschutzversicherung (legal insurance). There are several other collaborations, e.g. with BKK Linde health insurance.

As part of its partnership with Deutsche Bank Group, DVAG has been distributing Deutsche Bank (DB) banking products and DB subsidiary DWS investment funds since 2001. Further partners are Commerzbank, HypoVereinsbank, DSL Bank, Santander Bank, Allianz Global Investors, and Geiger Edelmetalle AG.

The Deutsche Verrechnungsstelle (DV), also based in Frankfurt/Main, specializes in professional invoice management for tradespeople and the SME sector. It offers products and services to ensure the liquidity of these companies. It was founded in 2015 by Andreas Pohl and Reinfried Pohl.

In Austria, DVAG has partners with Generali Versicherungs AG, Unicredit Bank Austria, BAWAG P.S.K., Allianz Global Investors, DWS and s Bausparkasse. The DVAG's Swiss business partners have been Generali, PAX, bank zweiplus, CSS, Innova, assura, Sanitas, Glarner Kantonalbank, and, since 2021, Global Sana AG. A holding company is to be founded in which the activities of Deutsche Vermögensberatung on the Swiss market will be bundled. This holding company will include the two independently operating companies Global Sana AG and SVAG Schweizer Vermögensberatung AG.


## Sponsorship

DVAG has been active in sports sponsoring since 1996, and in this context the company has worked with a number of athletes. Apart from the current partnership with Jürgen Klopp, sponsoring partners include Fabian Hambüchen, Britta Heidemann, Joey Kelly and Mick Schumacher.

Seven time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher has been working with DVAG since 1996. The existing sponsoring contract remains in effect even after Schumacher's serious skiing accident in December 2013. In February 2016, the Michael-Schumacher exhibition was opened in Marburg to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the partnership and ran through December 2018. Schumacher's son Mick is also currently sponsored by the company as he himself was a Formula One driver.

DVAG also sponsored 1. FC Kaiserslautern from 1998 to 2010.
