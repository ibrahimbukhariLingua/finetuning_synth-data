# Lennox International



**Lennox International Inc.** is an American provider of climate control products for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration markets. Based in Richardson, Texas, the company is 9.8% owned by John W. Norris, III, a descendant of DW Norris, who acquired the company in 1904. The company's largest production facilities are in Saltillo, Mexico, Marshalltown, Iowa, and Orangeburg, South Carolina.


## History

The company was founded in 1895, in Marshalltown, Iowa, by Dave Lennox, the owner of a machine repair business for railroads. Inventors Ezra William Smith and Ernest Bryant brought their idea for a riveted steel coal-fired furnace to his machine shop to build parts for a prototype. In lieu of payment, Lennox accepted their patent, obtaining rights to the idea and founded the Lennox Furnace Co.

In 1904, DW Norris acquired the company. He managed the company until his death in 1949.

From 1964 to 1965, Lennox produced a small crawler tractor and mower called the Lennox Kitty Track 600. It featured a 6 hp (4.5 kW) Briggs & Stratton engine and a 32" mower deck.

In 1999, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.
