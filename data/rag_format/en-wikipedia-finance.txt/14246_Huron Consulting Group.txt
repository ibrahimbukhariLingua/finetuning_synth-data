## Accounting violations investigation

In 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an investigation in Huron for a series of major accounting errors dating over several years. Six related shareholder class-action lawsuits were also filed against the company. On July 31, 2009, Huron announced that the company would restate its financial statements for 2006, 2007, 2008, and first quarter 2009. The chairman of the board and CEO Gary Holdren, CFO Gary Burge, and Chief Accounting Officer Wayne Lipski all resigned.

In 2010, Huron reached a settlement in its shareholder lawsuits in return for a payment of $38m. On July 19, 2012, Huron announced it had reached a final settlement with the SEC resolving the previously disclosed SEC investigation into the Company's August 2009 restatement of its financial statements for the years ended 2006, 2007 and 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. The Company agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, but also agreed to pay a $1m civil fine.


## Other controversies

Huron's role in higher education restructuring has attracted criticism. The company advocates for using post-Hurricane Katrina dispossessions as a model for how universities should operate, in the form of staff and faculty layoffs, program closures, salary reductions, and hiring freezes. Peter Stokes, Managing Director of Huron’s Higher Education Practice, has argued that higher education institutions should align their curriculums with corporate needs.

Huron's austerity-based recommendations led to major layoffs and the termination of many non-STEM programs at the University of Wisconsin in 2017, the University of New Hampshire in 2019, and the New School in 2022. In 2023, faculty at West Virginia University stated that Huron had provided "ill-informed consulting and faulty data" which contributed to the institution's major budget shortfall, debt crisis, and program cuts.
