Workbench


# Workbench



A **workbench** is a sturdy table at which manual work is done. They range from simple flat surfaces to very complex designs that may be considered tools in themselves. Workbenches vary in size from tiny jewellers benches to the huge benches used by staircase makers. Almost all workbenches are rectangular in shape, often using the surface, corners and edges as flat/square and dimension standards. Design is as varied as the type of work for which the benches are used but most share these attributes:

* A comfortable height for working with provisions for seated or standing work
* A way to fix the workpiece to the surface so that it may be worked with both hands
* Provisions for mounting, storing and accessing tools

Workbenches are made from many different materials including metal, wood, stone, and composites depending on the needs of the work.

* Wood: Typically built of thick and solid maple.
* Plastic or laminate
