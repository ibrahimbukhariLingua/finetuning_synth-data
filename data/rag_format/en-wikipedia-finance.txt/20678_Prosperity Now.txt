# Prosperity Now



**Prosperity Now**, formerly known as the **Corporation for Enterprise Development** (**CFED**), is a national nonprofit based in Washington, DC, dedicated to expanding economic opportunity for low-income families and communities in the United States. CFED uses an approach grounded in community practice, public policy, and private markets. CFED publishes research, partners with local practitioners to carry out demonstration projects, and engages in local, state, and national policy advocacy work. The organization works domestically with satellite offices in San Francisco, California, and Durham, North Carolina.


## History

CFED was founded in 1979 by Bob Friedman. Initially, the organization focused on economic development and microenterprise. It worked to reduce unemployment and expand opportunity by advocating for policies that would make it easier for entrepreneurs to start or expand a small business. In 1988, CFED launched the Development Report Card (DRC) for the States, a broad-based report that used multiple indicators to rate the economies of all 50 states. The DRC was widely used across the field and provided policymakers and businesses with a comparative measure to assess each state's business climate. The DRC was retired in 2007 and was replaced with the Assets & Opportunity Scorecard.

CFED was one of the first champions of Individual Development Accounts (IDA) – matched savings accounts that help low-income people save for a particular goal, such as buying a home, paying for post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business. In 1997, CFED launched the American Dream Demonstration, which was the first large-scale test of IDAs as a social and economic development tool. After seeing the success of IDAs, Congress passed the Assets for Independence Act (AFIA), providing $125 million over five years to fund IDAs. The AFI Program is administered by the Office of Community Services, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families. CFED is well known in the field as the expert on Individual Development Accounts, as well as other asset building programs and policies.
