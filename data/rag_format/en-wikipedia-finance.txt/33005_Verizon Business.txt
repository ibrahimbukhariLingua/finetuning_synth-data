# Verizon Business



**Verizon Business** (formerly known as **Verizon Enterprise Solutions**) is a division of Verizon Communications based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, that provides services and products for Verizon's business and government clients.

It was formed as Verizon Business in January 2006 and relaunched as Verizon Enterprise Solutions on January 1, 2012. Verizon reorganized into three units in January 2019, which included Verizon Business Group.


## Overview

According to analysts, Verizon is strengthening its position as a global leader in enterprise managed services. David Molony, Principal Analyst for Enterprise Services at Omdia, highlighted that Verizon leads worldwide based on the number of contracts and their overall value. As Verizon adapts its training approach to cater to the evolving needs of future leaders, it is also equipping its executives to act as catalysts for change. A recent RootMetrics report declared Verizon the "undisputed leader" in network reliability and coverage. The analysis showed Verizon outperformed competitors across both urban and rural regions. Additionally, Verizon Business has unveiled an advanced smartphone management solution aimed at simplifying processes and addressing challenges faced by business owners and IT teams.

Verizon Business was created following Verizon's acquisition of MCI Communications in January 2006. The division became Verizon Enterprise Solutions on January 1, 2012 and is based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. Verizon Enterprise Solutions is the division of Verizon Communications that manages Verizon's business and government clients. The division's network and services were available in more than 150 countries and it had employees in 75 countries in 2013.

Verizon Business operated 200 data centers in 22 countries, providing cloud, hosting and Internet colocation services to customers in 2013. It also had partial ownership in 80 submarine cable networks worldwide, including the SEA-ME-WE 4, Trans-Pacific Express, and the Europe India Gateway systems in 2011.

John Stratton led the division from January 2012 until April 2014 when Chris Formant was named president of the unit.

Verizon reorganized into three distinct units starting in January 2019 Verizon Consumer Group, Verizon Business Group, and Verizon Media Group. When this was announced, it was also announced that Tami Erwin, then executive vice president of wireless operations, would lead Verizon Business.

Erwin was replaced in July 2022 by Sowmyanarayan Sampath as CEO of Verizon Business. In March 2023, Kyle Malady replaced Sampath as CEO.


## Products and services

Verizon Business provides products both wireless and wireline for enterprise, small business and government.

Verizon Business Complete delivers a comprehensive, end-to-end solution, offering exceptional scalability and flexibility through Verizon’s high-speed, dependable 5G network. As IT departments take on the challenge of driving digital transformation—ranging from integrating GenAI to bolstering cybersecurity—Verizon Business Complete allows these teams to delegate smartphone management and focus on more strategic, high-value initiatives,” said Iris Meijer, Chief Product & Marketing Officer at Verizon Business.


### Networks

The company provides Private IP services and networks, as well as managed WAN and LAN services, among other networking services. Verizon also operates a global IP network that reaches 150 countries. In January 2012, Verizon began its Private IP Wireless (LTE) service, which combines 4G LTE with Verizon’s MPLS IP VPN.

Verizon Business offers cloud and data center services through its 11 cloud-enabled data centers.

Verizon offers colocation and managed services through these data centers.

In August 2011, Verizon purchased CloudSwitch. CloudSwitch's software allowed Verizon to offer clients the ability to use their existing applications with cloud services.

Verizon offers machine to machine (M2M) solutions for clients. Verizon established "Innovation Centers" in both Boston and San Francisco to help clients with M2M development.

Examples of Verizon Business M2M offerings include digital signage, smart cities, smart meters, fleet management, and asset tracking.

Verizon acquired Hughes Telematics in June 2012, expanding the division's M2M capabilities, particularly in telematics, which deals with vehicle telecommunications and technology.

After the acquisition, in March 2013, Verizon Enterprise Solutions began offering Networkfleet solutions, a service which tracks and analyzes data about commercial vehicle fleets to help customers optimize routes and manage their fleet vehicles and employees.
