InsWeb


# InsWeb



**InsWeb Corporation** formerly operated an online insurance marketplace designed to allow consumers to compare insurance products and rate quotes from a variety of providers. InsWeb does not provide insurance directly. The company connects consumers with multiple providers via a proprietary online technology platform. Customers receive price quotes for the various insurance products they choose and are contacted by outside insurance agents and/or companies to continue the purchasing process. In conjunction with the consumer-facing insurance quote system, they also operate a lead generating site as a marketing source for insurance agents.


## History

InsWeb was founded in 1995 by Hussein A. Enan and Darrell Ticehurst and became a publicly traded company in 1999. As of its IPO date it was the exclusive provider of auto insurance quotes on the Yahoo! internet portal.

In 2011, the primary business was sold to Bankrate. The unpurchased assets became the Internet Patents Corp which then changed its name to Prism Technologies.
