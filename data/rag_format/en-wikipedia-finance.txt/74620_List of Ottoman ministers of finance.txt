List of Ottoman ministers of finance


# List of Ottoman ministers of finance



This is a list of the top officials in charge of the finances of the Ottoman Empire, called ***Defterdar*** (Turkish for bookkeepers; from the Persian دفتردار *daftardâr*, دفتر *daftar* + دار *dâr*) between the 14th and 19th centuries and *Maliye Naziri* (**Minister of Finance**) between 19th and 20th centuries. They were originally in charge of the defters (tax registers) in the Ottoman Empire, hence the name *defterdar*.


## History of the office

The exact date of the formal establishment of the office is unknown. According to some sources, the first *defterdar* was the *Kadı* (judge) of Mihaliç, Çelebi bin Mehmed, appointed in 1359 or 1360, during the reign of Murad I. During the reign of Bayezid I (1389–1402), the poet Zahiri is mentioned as the *defterdar*.

In the classical period, the finances of the Empire were organized under a single *Defterdar*, literally the main bookkeeper, in charge of a single imperial treasury (*Hazine-i Amire*). Starting in 1793, smaller treasuries independent of the imperial treasury were organized, each with a separate *defterdar* in charge. In 1837, a modern ministry was founded under the name of *Maliye Nezareti*, merging most of the independent treasuries back to the Imperial Treasury. In 1840, the merging of the remaining independent treasuries was completed.


## Rank and title

Ministers of Finance in the classical period were called *Defterdar*, were members of the *Divan-ı Hümayun* and held rank higher than agha (military commander of the central organization, situated in Istanbul) and bey (provincial governor), and lower than vizier and kazasker (chief judge). Starting from 1837, Ministers of Finance were called *Maliye Nazırı*, held the rank of vizier, and were titled Pasha.
