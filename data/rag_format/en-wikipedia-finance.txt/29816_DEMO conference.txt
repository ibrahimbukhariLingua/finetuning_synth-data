DEMO conference


# DEMO conference



The **DEMO conference** is a series of technology-focused business conferences in which pre-selected companies and entrepreneurs launch new products and services. Produced by IDG, DEMO seeks to identify and promote new technology with the potential to solve big problems with careful selection and coaching. Products launched at DEMO include: Salesforce.com, TiVo, VMware, Evernote, E\*Trade, WebEx and Fusion-io. DEMO Conferences are held under the names DEMO Enterprise, DEMO Africa, DEMO China, DEMO Brazil, DEMO Asia (Vietnam), DEMO India, DEMO Europe (Russia), DEMO Pakistan, DEMO Traction, DEMO Tour, and DEMO Fall.

In 1990, Stewart Alsop II realized he was more intrigued by the one-on-one demonstrations of coming technologies conducted in hallways and hotel rooms during the off hours during technology conferences. This prompted Alsop to found the first DEMO Conference in 1991.

The conference draws media attention for its emerging technologies. At the DEMOSpring 2010 Conference, media attendees included *Business Week*, CBS, *Forbes*, *Los Angeles Times*, *Popular Science*, *USA Today*, and The Wall Street Journal. Entrepreneurs launching their products and services often cite publicity as a reason for choosing to pitch at DEMO. Additional conference attendees include venture capitalists, angels and other investors, corporate development officers, and entrepreneurs.

DEMO Conferences also feature prominent entrepreneurs and technology professionals as speakers and panelists at each event.
Previous speakers include Twitter cofounder and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, SAP CEO Bill McDermott, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Hewlett-Packard CTO Phil McKinney, and Google Enterprise President Dave Girouard.
