## History

Miller Buckfire was founded in July 2002 as Miller Buckfire Lewis & Co. by Henry Miller, Kenneth Buckfire and Martin Lewis, who previously led the restructuring groups at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and Wasserstein Perella & Co. Following the acquisition of Wasserstein Perella by Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in 2001, Miller, Buckfire and Lewis found they were being precluded from many restructuring assignments due to conflicts with Dresdner's loan portfolio. As a result, the trio acquired their business through a spinout from Dresdner and launched Miller Buckfire as an independent firm.

In 2003, the firm added a fourth partner David Ying to form Miller Buckfire Lewis Ying & Co. but following the 2004 departure of Martin Lewis and the 2005 departure of David Ying, the name of the firm was shortened to its current Miller Buckfire & Co.

In 2007, Sal. Oppenheim acquired 10% of Miller Buckfire as part of a strategic partnership between the two firms.

Former American Express Chairman and CEO Harvey Golub was appointed Chairman of Miller Buckfire in October 2011.

In 2012, the company was acquired by Stifel Financial.
