## History

eCircle was established in 1999 by Volker Wiewer and Thomas Wilke and entered the markets in the United Kingdom, Italy and France in 2000. In the same year the company was transformed into a public limited company (plc).

Originally eCircle's business was an email list management service, used to create and recruit members to mailing lists, including an archive of sent messages, similar to the eGroups.com product. The model was adapted to the service which eCircle provided. In 2009, eCircle opened offices in the Netherlands and Spain. In 2010 another office in Poland followed and in 2011 eCircle expanded into the Nordics region with a Scandinavian HQ in Copenhagen.

The company had 4 investors, Wellington Partners, Cipio Partners, Steadfast Capital and TA Associates, totaling €72.5million. In 2010, private equity firm TA Associates invested €60million, as the company estimated more than 200 employees.

US-based Teradata announced the final acquisition of eCircle on 4 June 2012, and it was merged into Teradata's Aprimo business.

eCircle had in excess of 350 employees in 2012.
