The establishment of Avenga took shape from 2019 when Ukrainian-American Corevalue and Germany's Sevenval joined the group. Then, IT Kontrakt, Solidbrain, Corevalue, and Sevenval came together to create the company.

In 2021, Avenga acquired a big Ukrainian software development firm, Perfectial. Finally, through the acquisition of IncluIT in 2022, Avenga expanded its delivery capabilities to the Americas.

On February 28, 2024, KKCG completed the acquisition of Avenga.
