Raghuram Rajan Committee on Financial Sector Reforms


# Raghuram Rajan Committee on Financial Sector Reforms



The **Raghuram Rajan Committee on Financial Sector Reforms** was a committee constituted by the Government of India in 2007 for proposing the next generation of financial sector reforms in India. It was chaired by University of Chicago economist Raghuram Rajan who had earlier been the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. The committee, in its report titled *A Hundred Small Steps*, recommended broad-based reforms across the financial sector, arguing that instead of focusing "on a few large, and usually politically controversial steps", India must "take a hundred small steps in the same direction".


## Background
