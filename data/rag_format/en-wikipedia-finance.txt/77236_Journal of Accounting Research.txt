## Alleged research misconduct

Non-academically-employed and non-peer-review published "researcher" Stephen Walker critiqued a 2020 JAR article, which resulted in JAR publishing a 2022 "Erratum." Walker characterized the "Erratum" as a mischaracterization of the original research, alleged it contained a falsehood, and called for a misconduct investigation. The University of Melbourne's Ian D. Gow published the paper "Should Bao et al. (2020) be retracted?" in 2022, followed up by another paper where he called the "Erratum"'s explanation less than plausible, said it was belied by the original paper, and claimed it failed to account for the "claimed error." Overall, Gow argued that a "retract and republish" approach may have been superior to an "erratum" approach in order to most clearly correct the record from the original paper. JAR performed an extensive investigation and shared its findings with Walker in a 2023 document created as a result of Walker's request for the misconduct investigation, but did not publish the document.
