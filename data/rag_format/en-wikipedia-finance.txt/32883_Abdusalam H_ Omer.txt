In May 1997, Omer was appointed deputy chief financial officer of the Washington, D.C. government. His duties therein included managing a yearly budget of $2 billion in addition to a $6 billion operating budget. He also formulated developed comprehensive policy and budget analysis, advanced format and process reforms, and achieved balanced budgets for three straight years.

He also provided guidance and support to the agency directors and deputy mayors, maintained political relations with Congress and the Council, fielded concerns of local constituents, liaised with the national media, and developed performance benchmarks, strategic planning, and other aspects of the overall policy agenda of the District of Columbia.

Between 2002 and 2006, Omer began serving as the head of the United Nations Development Program's Governance and Financial Services Program (GFS) in Somalia's autonomous northern Puntland and Somaliland regions. The program entailed training in tax collection, government budget and financial management, and allocating land management and establishing urban planning and design units vis-a-vis select cities in conjunction with UNHABITAT.

### Central Bank of Somalia

On 17 January 2013, Omer was appointed the new Governor of the Central Bank of Somalia by incumbent President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. His duties include restructuring the monetary authority.

In order to facilitate the task of post-conflict reconstruction and development, Omer announced in May 2013 that the Central Bank would replace the provisional licences it is issuing to commercial banks with full licenses by the end of the year. The provisional licences are intended to familiarize commercial banks with the general banking regulations, including anti-money laundering rules, that must be complied with once full licences are issued. Several foreign banks are reportedly already interested in acquiring the permits.

For policy making, Omer also indicated that the Central Bank was collecting data to ascertain price levels and other indicators related to the growing informal economy.

Additionally, he announced that the Somali government was planning on releasing a new currency to replace the Somali shilling. The shilling had strengthened by around 80% after the eviction of insurgents from Mogadishu in 2011. However, it was in short supply since it was last printed prior to 1991. The International Monetary Fund is expected to provide support in this endeavour, as it formally recognized the Somali government in April 2013.

Omer also stated that the Central Bank would resume debt sales after a period of around 24 months, including treasury bills.

In July 2013, the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea (SEMG) alleged that 80 percent of withdrawals from the Central Bank of Somalia were made for private purposes. While acknowledging that the new national leadership presented an opportunity for change, the panel also suggested that the Bank was operating as a patronage system for government officials. The report alleged that Omer was at the center of the purported irregularities, arguing that he made all banking decisions in the absence of a board and that the Bank was not subject to the legislature or government oversight institutions. Omer described the charges as an attempt to discredit the nation's budding financial institutions and him personally as the new Governor of the Central Bank, and called for an audit by Transparency International. Additionally, he indicated that most of the funds that the panel alleged were missing had been deposited in a Finance Ministry account at the Central Bank, while the rest had been deposited in an account that a former prime minister had established for regional relations. According to Omer, the bank deposits had been made with the assistance and signatures of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) representatives. The president's office concurrently issued a statement rejecting the allegations, indicating that they dated from a previous administration. Shortly afterwards, the Somali authorities hired forensic accountants from FTI Consulting, Inc. and a legal team from the US firm Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy & Ecker, PA to investigate the charges. In September 2013, the Somali government announced that the auditors had found that the methodology and conclusions of the SEMG report's Annex 5.2 were "deeply flawed and entirely unreliable." The auditing firms consequently recommended the removal of the section of the SEMG's report containing corruption allegations. They also requested that the United Nations Security Council publicly sanction the SEMG for failing to adhere to and apply the UN's internal fact-finding standards.

Omer was shocked by the allegations. He recalls his past job in Washington and how he typically was the one calling out financial mismanagement. "I don't know if anybody knows the magnitude of problems at D.C. public schools. It's mind-boggling," he told *The Washington Post* in 2007, after he had been named chief business operations officer.

"He denies the U.N. monitoring group's claim that the central bank funds went missing at all, but particularly on his watch."

"During the period they claim funds were missing, I was not the governor and I was not part of the government," he said in an interview.

On 13 September 2013, Omer resigned as governor of the Central Bank of Somalia a few hours after the presidential office informed him that changes would be made at the institution. He was succeeded at the position by Yussur A.F. Abrar. She is the first woman to be appointed as the Central Bank's governor.

In response to a call from President of Yemen Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi for Arab League cooperation in stabilizing the situation, he and Mohamud also reaffirmed Somalia's support for the legitimacy of the incumbent Yemeni government and its anti-terrorist efforts.
