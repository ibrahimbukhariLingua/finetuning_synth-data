## History

The Indian Poultry industry suffered an unusual series of crises in the early 1980sᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, since the selling price had dropped below production costs. Many poultry farmers shut down operations due to heavy losses. A group of farmers motivated by Dr. B. V. Rao and Ch. Jagapati Rao traveled across the country, organizing over 300 meetings with groups, individuals, and traders. Their objective was to unite poultry farmers from all over India. In May 1982, NECC was formally registered as a trust under the Indian Societies Registration Act and on 14 May 1982, NECC started declaring egg prices.
