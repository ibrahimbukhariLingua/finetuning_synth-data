**Forvia SE** (stylized in all-uppercase), formerly **Faurecia SE**, is a French global automotive supplier headquartered in Nanterre, in the western suburbs of Paris. In 2022 it was the 7th largest international automotive parts manufacturer in the world and #1 for vehicle interiors and emission control technology. One in two automobiles is equipped by Faurecia. It designs and manufactures seats, exhaust systems, interior systems (dashboards, centre consoles, door panels, acoustic modules) and decorative aspects of a vehicle (aluminium, wood).

Faurecia's customers include the Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi, Ford, General Motors, BMW, Daimler, Toyota, Tesla, Inc., Hyundai-Kia, Jaguar Land Rover and BYD among others. Faurecia employs 8,300 engineers and technicians. The company operates over 300 production sites and 35 R&D centres in 37 countries worldwide, with 403 patents filed in 2017. About half of these sites are manufacturing plants operating on the just-in-time principle. Faurecia joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2004.

The company was at the core of a bribery scandal in 2006 which led to the resignation and legal conviction of its then CEO Pierre Lévi.

In 2022, the company merged with German auto parts manufacturer Hella, the merged business being named Forvia.

In April 2024, L&T Technology Services partnered with Forvia Forge at €45 million deal.
