## History

The company was co-founded in 1982 by Nemir Kirdar, Elias Hallak, Savio Tung, Mike Merritt, and Cem Cesmig and acquired Tiffany & Co in 1984, floating in 1987. In 1988, Maurizio Gucci sold almost 47.8% of Gucci to Investcorp, and withheld the other 50% until 1993.

The company diversified in 1997 into hedge funds. Kirdar stepped down as CEO and executive chairman in 2015. With Kirdar resigning, Mohammad Alardhi became the Executive Chairman of the company. The changes also involved an update to the business model, which is now focused on raising funds, raising institutional capital, and diversifying strategies further.

Investcorp made several acquisitions between 2016 and 2019, pushing into China with investments into tech and the food sector. In 2019, the company also pushed into the US market with the acquisition of Mercury Capital, which ceased operations in late 2024 "due to the very challenging capital raising environment". Investcorp's portfolio company, Moneybookers, ended its relationship with WikiLeaks in August 2010.

The company was regulated in Bahrain as a wholesale bank until 2019, when it voluntarily surrendered its wholesale banking license. It remained listed on the Bahrain Bourse (BSE) for four decades until 2021, when it delisted itself as a result of low trading volumes.
