# Baltimore Community Foundation



The **Baltimore Community Foundation** (**BCF**) is a community foundation created by and for the people of Baltimore to serve the current and future needs of the Baltimore region.

The foundation distributed $30.7 million in 2020 to more than 1,500 nonprofit organizations in the Baltimore region and beyond. It comprises more than 850 different charitable funds created by individuals, families, and corporations, totaling more than $240 million in assets. In addition to managing donor-advised funds, BCF makes grants and impact investments, and advocates for policies to improve public education and quality of life in Baltimore neighborhoods. Its role as an advocate was highlighted in FSG Social Impact Advisors’ 2009 report, *Raising Money While Raising Hell*.


## History

In 1972, leaders of Baltimore's five major banks joined to establish the Community Foundation of the Greater Baltimore Area. Inspired by the success of the nation's first community foundation in Cleveland, Ohio, and a rapidly growing network of community foundations nationwide. Co-founder Robert Levi of Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust, the fledgling organization's first chairman, felt strongly that Baltimore needed “a philanthropic organization that was a gathering of all people—no color line, no religious affiliation, no special cause.”


## Governance

BCF is governed by a 30-member board of trustees, selected to represent diverse community interests. Its staff includes professionals in community investment, donor services, development, finance and administration, and communications.
