Camunda


# Camunda



**Camunda** is a process orchestration platform used to control complex business processes for enterprise companies. The software is classified by specialist media as a business process automation tool or digital process automation software and therefore represents a further development of the classic workflow management platform.


## Overview

Process orchestration is the main topic at the biannual CamundaCon (formerly BPM Con)[‚Å∂], which is organized by Camunda. Other conferences such as JAX (and W-JAX) or Devoxx are also regularly dedicated to the topic.


## History

Camunda 7 is an originally commercial workflow management system, which was based on Activiti, a free business process management system. Alongside Alfresco, Camunda was one of the biggest contributors of Activiti.

On 18 March 2013, the further development of Camunda was spun off from the development of Activiti.


## Features

Camunda consists of a number of components and applications that are used together to define and execute business processes:

The Camunda Modeler desktop application and web modeler allow developers to create and edit BPMN process diagrams and DMN decision tables.

External endpoints can be integrated into processes via Connectors, which are pre-built and customizable packages consisting of BPMN-elements and API templates. With the release of Camunda 8.3, Camunda Marketplace was added, allowing users to share and download additional Connectors for various business systems.

Created files are deployed in the Camunda Engines, which use a BPMN parser to transform BPMN 2.0 XML files, and DMN XML files, into Java Objects, and implements BPMN 2.0 constructs with a set of BPMN Behavior implementations.

Typical use cases for the Camunda BPMN Workflow Engine can be microservices orchestration and human task management.

The Camunda DMN Decision Engine executes business-driven decision tables. It is pre-integrated with the Workflow Engine but can be used as a stand-alone application via REST or inside Java applications.

Camunda's additional web applications provide the following tools for developers and business users:

* Operate: A tool for technical process operations enabling users to monitor workflows and decisions in production, to analyze and solve technical problems.

* Tasklist: Allows end users to work on assigned tasks and provides additional visibility when using the Camunda Workflow Engine for human task management.

* Optimize: An analytics and reporting tool to identify errors and bottlenecks in workflow processes.

* Modeler: A collaborative modeling tool allowing multiple users to create, edit and specify BPMN process diagrams.

* Console: Allows users to manage Camunda web applications or REST API users. Existing user management can be integrated via LDAP.

## Architecture

Camunda Platform is a lightweight, Java-based framework. It can be used as a standalone process engine server or embedded inside custom Java applications. It offers non-Java developers a REST API and dedicated client libraries to build applications connecting to a remote workflow engine.
