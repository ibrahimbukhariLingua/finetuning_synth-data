Distortion risk measure


# Distortion risk measure



In financial mathematics and economics, a **distortion risk measure** is a type of risk measure which is related to the cumulative distribution function of the return of a financial portfolio.


## Mathematical definition

The function {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}:L^{p}\to \mathbb {R} } associated with the distortion function {\displaystyle g:[0,1]\to [0,1]} is a *distortion risk measure* if for any random variable of gains {\displaystyle X\in L^{p}} (where {\displaystyle L^{p}} is the Láµ– space) then

where {\displaystyle F\_{-X}} is the cumulative distribution function for {\displaystyle -X} and {\displaystyle {\tilde {g}}} is the dual distortion function {\displaystyle {\tilde {g}}(u)=1-g(1-u)}.

If {\displaystyle X\leq 0} almost surely then {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}} is given by the Choquet integral, i.e. {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}(X)=-\int \_{0}^{\infty }g(1-F\_{-X}(x))dx.} Equivalently, {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}(X)=\mathbb {E} ^{\mathbb {Q} }[-X]} such that {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} } is the probability measure generated by {\displaystyle g}, i.e. for any {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {F}}} the sigma-algebra then {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} (A)=g(\mathbb {P} (A))}.


### Properties

In addition to the properties of general risk measures, distortion risk measures also have:

1. *Law invariant*: If the distribution of {\displaystyle X} and {\displaystyle Y} are the same then {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}(X)=\rho \_{g}(Y)}.
2. *Monotone* with respect to first order stochastic dominance.
 1. If {\displaystyle g} is a concave distortion function, then {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}} is monotone with respect to second order stochastic dominance.
3. {\displaystyle g} is a concave distortion function if and only if {\displaystyle \rho \_{g}} is a coherent risk measure.

## Examples

* Value at risk is a distortion risk measure with associated distortion function {\displaystyle g(x)={\begin{cases}0&{\text{if }}0\leq x<1-\alpha \\1&{\text{if }}1-\alpha \leq x\leq 1\end{cases}}.}
* Conditional value at risk is a distortion risk measure with associated distortion function {\displaystyle g(x)={\begin{cases}{\frac {x}{1-\alpha }}&{\text{if }}0\leq x<1-\alpha \\1&{\text{if }}1-\alpha \leq x\leq 1\end{cases}}.}
* The negative expectation is a distortion risk measure with associated distortion function {\displaystyle g(x)=x}.
