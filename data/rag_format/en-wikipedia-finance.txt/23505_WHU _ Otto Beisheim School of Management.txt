## History


### Founding and name change

WHU was founded in 1984 by the Koblenz Chamber of Commerce as the *Wissenschaftliche Hochschule für Unternehmensführung*, with preparations for the founding starting in 1983. Starting in 1986, the school began offering a doctoral studies program, and the process for offering postdoctoral studies began in 1997.

The name was modified in 1993 to honour WHU's benefactor, the businessman Otto Beisheim, after he donated 50 Million Deutsche Mark.


### Later development

In 1997, an executive MBA with Kellogg School of Management was started. A year later, the school received a EQUIS-accreditation, followed by a FIBAA in 2005 and the beginning of MBA studies the same year. In 2006, the school became a member of AACSB, and was re-accredited by EQUIS in 2009.


### Accusations of problems with the internal culture and excessive stress since 2010

The business school has been accused of fostering an overly competitive environment, even at the cost of the mental health of its students. Additionally, they were accused of overly focusing on rankings and grades but insufficiently developing the ability for critical discourse and not succeeding at creating a student body with an appropriate diversity of backgrounds. Additional criticisms, including by former students, often focus on excessive memorisation and a failure to foster a culture of out-of-the-box thinking.

After the death of a student who was believed to have died due to overworking himself during an internship but was found to have died due to an underlying condition, the school responded that high pressure is an unfortunately norm in the business world and that they are taking steps to address it.


### Controversy about the academic work of Ulrich Lichtenthaler in 2012

A former student and then-professor at the University, Ulrich Lichtenthaler, was accused of repeated and significant misconduct in his research and publications.

WHU and the University of Mannheim later withdrew his right to teach, and he resigned from his position.
