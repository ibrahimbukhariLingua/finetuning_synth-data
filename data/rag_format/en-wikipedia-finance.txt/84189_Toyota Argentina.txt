## History

The first Toyota vehicles were imported to Argentina in the 1950s because of a law that allowed the import of duty free vehicles in Patagonia. Nevertheless, Toyota cars did not experience a real success until the late 1970s to mid-1980s with the imported models like the Celica coupe and Hilux pickup.

In 1993, Toyota decided to establish itself in Argentina as part of a global strategy within Mercosur. Since the end of the 1950s, Toyota already had an assembly plant in Brazil where it produced the Bandeirante utility vehicle, and the regime in force in the region allowed a complementation between both factories.

That same year, countries of Central America and the Caribbean were added to the list of export markets.
