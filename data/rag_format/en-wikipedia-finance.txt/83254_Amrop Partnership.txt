**Amrop Partnership** is a Belgium-based global partnership of executive search firms. The largest executive search firm in Europe and a top-3 globally with 59 offices worldwide as of 2018, Amrop was founded in 1977.


## History

Amrop was founded in 1977 as a network of four retained executive search firms in France, Italy, the UK, Australia and the US. This network was called Amrop International.

In Canada, Amrop is known as Massey Charbonneau Inc., and it is one of Canada's leading senior executive search firms.

Mülder & Partner, the strongest partner of Amrop, was acquired in 1997 by the integrated firm Heidrick & Struggles and left the network. The American and Italian network members of Amrop, namely, Lamalie Amrop and TMC Amrop were taken over by TMP Associates and also left the network. Amrop International attempted to fill the gaps in the German market in 1999 by including Hofmann Herbold & Partner in its network. Shortly afterward, Korn Ferry bought the new German associate, Amrop Hofmann Herbold.

In 1998, Amrop Hofmann Herbold & Partner Management-Beratung GmbH (German subsidiary of Amrop) reported revenue increase to 26.6 million DM which made the company among the top executive search firms in Germany.

In June 2000, Amrop acquired Delta Management GmbH, a Düsseldorf-based firm and a founding partner of the Hever Group since 1986. This merger led to the creation of what was claimed to be the largest international organization of independent personnel consulting firms at the time. Operating as "The Hever Amrop Alliance," it spanned 52 countries with 81 offices and boasted a total fee revenue exceeding 220 million DM, ranking as the seventh-largest consulting organization globally.

According to *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,* in 2002, Amrop, with over 80 locations worldwide, saw a 10% revenue drop in 2002 to $102 million. Delta Management Consultants GmbH, was its largest member at that time with six German offices, also faced a 16% revenue decrease to 14 million euros.

In 2003, Delta Management achieved 12 million euro in sales in Germany, becoming the largest company within Amrop Hever group.

In 2005, Delta Management Consulting, as a member of the Amrop network operating in Germany, got a 26 percent increase in fee sales, rising to €15.1 million. It was primarily due to the acquisition of five new partners. As of that year, the company maintained six offices throughout Germany and, in 2004-2005, expanded its reach by acquiring Battalia Winston International in the U.S., with the network's revenue in 2004 totaling approximately $150 million, as reported by *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*.

In 2006, Arno Röss was appointed managing director of Amrop Hever Delta Management Consultants GmbH, Munich office. He was previously managing partner of Accentum Human Capital GmbH, Munich.

In 2000, Amrop International merged with the Hever Group, creating the newly formed Amrop Hever Group. In 2005, Amrop Hever had more offices worldwide than any other search firm. In 2005, the firm had a €128 million in turnover.

According to the 2005 the Economist special report *Headhunters and How to Use Them*, Amrop Hever, is a network of 59 independent search firms, operating internationally through a semi-integrated network guided by French law following a dual-branding approach with firms like Rossignol Todd & Associates in France, Saxton Bampfy in the UK, Seeliger y Conde in Spain and Dr Besmer Consulting in Switzerland. Those firms are more famous in local markets then Amrop brand, that help in enhancing local recognition.

In 2008, NewsWeek included four Amrop's executives in the list the Most Influential Headhunters.

In 2009, the name was changed to Amrop.

In 2011, Amrop forged a partnership with the Swiss business school International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and launched its Trusted Advisor Program under the umbrella of Amrop University.

In 2014, Amrop and the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) published a global C-suite study: 'Welcome to the Flight Deck' — exploring the human dimension of globalizing mid-caps. In the same year, Amrop was named among the 20 leading global executive search firms.

Since 2015, Amrop has increased its presence in EMEA and relaunched its global Leadership Advisory and Board Services practices.

In 2016, Russell Reynolds Associates completed the acquisition of the Norway-based Amrop AS. Following the acquisition, Amrop AS will operate under the Russell Reynolds Associates brand.

In 2017, Amrop strengthened its global footprint across EMEA and Asia Pacific.

Amrop also released a report titled '*Wise Decision-Making: Stepping Up to Sustainable Performance*'.

In 2021, Amrop Partnership and JM Search (an independent retained search and leadership advisory firm) announced a strategic alliance to expand global client reach. In the same year, Seeliger y Conde (SyC) which had been for 25 years the partner of Amrop left the group. While in Peru, the local firm consolidated the market share to 40% according to the analysis of *El Comercio*.

As *Diario Financiero* reported, in 2022 the Chilean Pension Fund (AFP) selected Max Vicuña's Amrop headhunting firm to oversee the election of company directors, entrusting Amrop with the task of identifying candidates to represent administrators on the boards of companies in which AFP invests.
