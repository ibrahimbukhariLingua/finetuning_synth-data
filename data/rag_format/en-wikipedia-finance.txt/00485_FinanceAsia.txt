# FinanceAsia



***FinanceAsia*** is a Hong Kong–based publication reporting on Asia Pacific’s financial and capital markets through a daily website and weekly newsletter. At the end of 2005, *FinanceAsia* was acquired by Haymarket Group, the largest privately owned publishing company in the UK, created in part by Lord Heseltine, the former UK deputy prime minister.

*FinanceAsia* was established in 1996 as a monthly magazine and has since evolved into a more digital format with daily news and a weekly newsletter sent by email. *FinanceAsia* organises two annual awards for Asia's financial industry, the *FinanceAsia* Achievement Awards, which each year recognise the region's most significant transactions and the financial institutions that advised on them. In addition, the *FinanceAsia* Awards recognises the most significant banks, rating agencies and law firms across the region. The trophies are given out at two separate dinners.
