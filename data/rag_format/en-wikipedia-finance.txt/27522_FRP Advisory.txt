## History

The firm was formed in June 2010 to undertake a management buyout of the Business Recovery Services division of Vantis plc. FRP did not make a cash payment for the business, but took on £11 million of Vantis' debt.

In March 2020, FRP Advisory Group PLC listed on the Alternative Investments Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange, with a market capitalisation on admission of £190m.


## Stanford International Bank

Former Vantis executives Nigel Hamilton-Smith and Peter Wastell were the joint liquidators of Stanford International Bank Limited and Stanford Trust Company Limited, a high-profile appointment which was reported as contributing to the collapse of Vantis. Hamilton-Smith and Wastell transferred to FRP Advisory and continued to act on the liquidation, and FRP Advisory fought to have them reinstated as liquidators of Stanford after a court decision to remove them, but the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal confirmed their removal in May 2011, passing the case to Grant Thornton.
