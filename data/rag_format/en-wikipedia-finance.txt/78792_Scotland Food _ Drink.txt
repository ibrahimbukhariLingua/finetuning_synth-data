**Scotland Food & Drink** is the industry leadership trade association established in 2007. It aims to collaboratively grow the value of the industry to £30 billion by 2030 and to reinforce the reputation of Scotland as a Land of Food and Drink.

Every year Scotland Food & Drink helps organise the Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight.


## History

Scotland Food & Drink was created in June 2007, and aims to brings together all key sectors of Scotland's food and drink industry, plus trade organisations and public sector agencies (Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise).

Its launch was the first official engagement of Richard Lochhead MSP in his role as Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment for the Scottish Government. Since then, the organisation has developed and launched a new strategy for the entire industry called Ambition 2030 which looks to grow the industry to a value of £30bn by 2030.

Its inaugural chief executive, Paul McLaughlin, left in August 2011 to join Scotty Brand Ltd and was replaced in September 2011 by James Withers.
