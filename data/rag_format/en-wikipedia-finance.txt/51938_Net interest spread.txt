Net interest spread


# Net interest spread



**Net interest spread** refers to the difference in borrowing and lending rates of financial institutions (such as banks) in nominal terms. It is considered analogous to the gross margin of non-financial companies.

Net interest spread is expressed as interest yield on earning assets (any asset, such as a loan, that generates interest income) minus interest rates paid on borrowed funds.

Net interest spread is similar to net interest margin; net interest spread expresses the nominal average difference between borrowing and lending rates, without compensating for the fact that the amount of earning assets and borrowed funds may be different.


## Example

For example, a bank has average loans to customers of $100, and earns gross interest income of $6. The interest yield is 6/100 = 6%. A bank takes deposits from customers and pays 1% to those customers. The bank lends its customers money at 6%. The bank's net interest spread is 5%.
