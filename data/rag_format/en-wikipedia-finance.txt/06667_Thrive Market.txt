## History

Thrive Market was launched in November 2014 to address the geographical and monetary challenges that bar communities from healthy food. Green and Lovelace met via Green's involvement in Launchpad LA. Lovelace grew up on an organic farm in Ojai, California and saw the power of group buying as a way to make healthy food affordable and build community.

When Green and Lovelace initially tried to raise money for Thrive Market, they were rejected by more than 50 venture-capital firms. They then focused on building a network of more than 200 health and wellness investors—including Deepak Chopra, Tony Robbins, and Jillian Michaels—to support Thrive Market individually. As of 2016, Thrive Market has raised $141 million from Greycroft Partners, E-Ventures, Cross Culture Ventures, and Invus.

Thrive Market has three fulfillment centers from which distribution is made, one at Batesville, Indiana, and another at Tahoe Reno Industrial Center near Reno, Nevada. The most recent center opened in 2021 in Hanover Township, PA. They advertise delivery to 85% of the United States within two days. The company currently employs more than 500 people.

In 2016, the company raised a $111M Series B led by Invus. At the time, the company had 300,000 paying members and sold $200,000 worth of goods per day. That February, Thrive Market launched a mobile app, available for iOS and Android systems.

In June 2016, Thrive Market launched an online petition asking the USDA to accept food stamps online. Soon after the petition launched, Gunnar Lovelace participated in a congressional briefing hosted by Congressman Tim Ryan and actress-activist Shailene Woodley. Lovelace also met with Senior Nutrition Policy Advisor Debra Eschmeyer and USDA officials in the White House. On September 25, 2016, the USDA announced plans for its pilot program for online shopping and called for volunteers to apply for participation.

Thrive Market launched 165 self-branded products in 2018. Thrive Market grew rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues grew by 90%.

In 2021, it was reported Thrive sought a valuation of over $2 billion while considering going public. Two of Thrive’s three distribution centers were TRUE-certified in 2021.

As of November 2022, Thrive Market serves 1.2 million members. In April 2023, Thrive Market converted to a Public-benefit corporation. On February 26, 2024, Thrive Market became the first online-only grocer to accept SNAP EBT.
