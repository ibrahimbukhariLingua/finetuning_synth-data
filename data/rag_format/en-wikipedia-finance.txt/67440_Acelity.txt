**Acelity L.P. Inc.**, was a privately held medical device company. It was a non-operating holding company whose wholly owned subsidiaries developed advanced wound therapeutics products. The advanced wound therapeutics business was conducted by Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI) and its subsidiaries, including **Systagenix**.

The company reported $1.87 billion in annual revenue globally in 2015.

## History

Acelity began as Kinetic Concepts Inc., a medical technology company founded in 1976 by Dr. Jim Leininger, an emergency room physician in San Antonio, Texas. Over time, the company developed or acquired a line of therapeutic specialty beds, introducing a specialty bed for acute care patients with pulmonary complications. Initially KCI's product development focused on therapeutic beds and surfaces then expanded to introduce V.A.C. Therapy, the first commercial negative pressure wound therapy products in the mid-1990s. In 2016, more than 10 million wounds were treated with V.A.C. Therapy worldwide since its introduction. In 2008, KCI acquired LifeCell, a company specializing in regenerative medicine, in a non-hostile transaction for US$1.7 billion. In October 2013, KCI acquired Systagenix Wound Management, originally Johnson & Johnson's professional wound care business for $485 million. In September 2014, KCI's parent company announced that KCI, LifeCell and Systagenix would operate under one global medical technology brand known as Acelity. On December 21, 2016, pharmaceutical company Allergan announced it would acquire LifeCell Corp. for US$2.9 billion. The sale completed on February 1, 2017.

In April 2017, Acelity announced R. Andrew Eckert would replace Joseph Woody as chief executive and president.


## Financial information

From the founding of KCI in 1976 to 1988, the revenue of KCI grew to US$153.2 million. The growth in revenue allowed KCI to go public and trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the first time in 1988. KCI stock was traded on the NYSE until 1997, when the company went private. In February 2004, KCI became a publicly listed company for the second time and was listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol KCI. By the late 2000s, the company's revenue was over $1 billion and reported an increase of 17 percent in 2007 to $1.61 billion. Revenue for 2008 was $1.88 billion, increasing to $1.99 billion in 2009 and in 2010 increased to $2.02 billion. In 2011, the company went private again at a price of $68.50 per share. In August 2015, Acelity filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a proposed initial offering of its common stock. On December 7, 2016, the company withdrew its IPO registration statement with the SEC, citing a challenging IPO market.
