## Early life

C. B. Bhave was born in Nagpur, Maharashtra. He is an electrical engineer from Jabalpur Engineering College and 1975 batch IAS officer.


## Career

C. B. Bhave started out an IAS officer in Maharashtra. He was additional Industries Commissioner of Maharashtra for three years. He moved up to the Centre with a position as undersecretary in the Ministry of Finance and deputy secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum.

When G. V. Ramakrishna became chairman of SEBI, he invited Bhave to join SEBI. This gave a highly successful first stint at SEBI, which ushered in the revolution of the Indian equity market.

Bhave had irreconcilable differences with D. R. Mehta, the SEBI Chairman, and strong views about the direction of reforms of the equity market. He left SEBI to lead what was then a startup, the National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL). NSDL had been incubated inside NSE but for all practical purposes, it was a startup when Bhave took over as managing director. This was also a highly successful period, where India made the transition into dematerialised settlement at the depository.

After this, Bhave came back to SEBI as chairman for three years.
