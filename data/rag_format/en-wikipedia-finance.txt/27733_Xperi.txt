# Xperi



**Xperi Inc.** is an American multinational technology company headquartered in San Jose, California, that develops software for consumer electronics and connected cars, as well as media platforms for video service over broadband. The company is organized into four business units: Pay-TV, Consumer Electronics, Connected Car, and Media Platform. Xperi's brands include DTS, HD Radio, and TiVo.

Xperi Inc. was formerly part of Xperi Holding Corporation, which was itself the result of significant M&A over many years, including publicly traded firms such as DTS, Inc. and TiVo Corporation.


## History

Xperi Holding Corporation traces its roots to **Tessera, Inc.**, which was founded in 1990 and renamed **Tessera Technologies, Inc.** prior to its initial public offering in 2003. Tessera developed chip-scale packaging technologies that were broadly licensed in the semiconductor industry.

In 2008, Tessera acquired FotoNation, which specialized in image enhancement and analysis, and in 2016 Tessera acquired DTS, Inc., an audio technologies company. DTS had previously acquired iBiquity Digital Corporation in 2015, which developed the North American digital audio broadcast standard known as HD Radio.

At the completion of the acquisition of DTS in December 2016, Tessera Technologies, Inc. became Tessera Holding Corporation, and two months later began operating under the new corporate name Xperi Corporation.

On December 19, 2019, Xperi Corporation and TiVo Corporation announced their intent to merge. The merger was completed on June 1, 2020. The combined entity operated under the name Xperi Holding Corporation, and became one of the largest intellectual property (IP) and product licensing companies in the world. On October 1, 2022, the product business of Xperi Holding Corporation was separated from the IP licensing business and spun-off as a stand-alone public company named Xperi Inc., trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol XPER. At the same time, Xperi Corporation, consisting of the remaining IP licensing business, changed its name to Adeia Inc. and began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ADEA.
