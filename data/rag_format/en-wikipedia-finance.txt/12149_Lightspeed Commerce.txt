## History

Lightspeed was founded by Dax da Silva in 2005, with its headquarters in Montreal, to provide point-of-sale and e-commerce software for retail businesses. In 2014, it expanded its customer base to include the hospitality industry. It has its offices in Montreal, New York, Ottawa, Toronto, London, Paris, Belfast, Amsterdam, Berlin, Geneva, Ghent and Melbourne. The company is backed by iNovia Capital and Accel Partners. *Profit* has ranked Lightspeed 24th in 2011 and 61st in 2012 on its list of "Canada's 200 fastest growing companies".

Accel Partners led a $30 million investment round in 2012 and from 2012 to 2013, the company observed a 120% growth in annual transactions. It acquired MerchantOS, point-of-sale software developer, and Lightspeed Retail, an HTML5 web-based product that can be used from any computer in 2013. Lightspeed's customers processed $7.5 billion in 2013. At the time, the company had more than 15,000 store locations.

On June 18, 2014, the company added Advanced Analytics to Lightspeed Retail's feature roster. In September, Lightspeed closed a $35 million investment round led by iNovia Capital.

## Criticism

On September 29 2021, short seller Spruce Point Capital Management publicly accused Lightspeed of exaggerating its finances to investors. The stock fell 11% following the firm's report, closing at $126 a share on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The firm alleged that Lightspeed has covered up "massive inflation" of how many customers it has, how much money it makes from them and how much growth potential it has. Spruce Point argued that the company is massively overvalued and is poised to plummet to as low as $22 a share.

Following Spruce Point's report, Lightspeed released a statement saying, "The report contains numerous important inaccuracies and mischaracterizations which Lightspeed believes are misleading and clearly intended to benefit Spruce Point, which itself has disclosed that it stands to profit in the event that the stock price of Lightspeed declines."
