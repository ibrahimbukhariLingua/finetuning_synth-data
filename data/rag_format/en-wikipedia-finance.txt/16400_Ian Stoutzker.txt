## Philharmonia Orchestra

Following the death of its principal conductor, Otto Klemperer, in 1973, the New Philharmonia Orchestra needed financial support and new musical leadership. The financial support was provided when for the first time a non-playing member of a London orchestra was appointed chairman. He also proposed and oversaw the complicated legal issues of restoring its name, in 1977, from the "New Philharmonia Orchestra" to the original name of the "Philharmonia Orchestra". He held the appointment as chairman from 1973 to 1976 and was president of the orchestra from 1976 to 1979.


## Live Music Now

In 1977, Yehudi Menuhin asked Stoutzker if he would realise a dream close to his heart. The scheme was to be called "Live Music Now". Menuhin's experiences during the Second World War playing to the sick and the wounded together with his desire to help talented young musicians had given him the idea of creating an organisation that would have a dual purpose. Its aim would be to reach out to those less fortunate in society to enjoy the benefits of live music and at the same time help young musicians at the start of their career. Stoutzker was appointed chairman in 1978. In 2018, Stoutzker passed the role of chairman to Sir Vernon Ellis while remaining as president.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## European Union Youth Orchestra
