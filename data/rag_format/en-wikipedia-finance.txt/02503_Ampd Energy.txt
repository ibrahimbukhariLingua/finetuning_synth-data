## History

Ampd Energy was founded in December 2014. Its founder, Brandon Ng created an electric motorcycle company during a blackout in the city; they reasoned that the batteries of their motorcycles could be redesigned to power buildings.

## Product

In December 2016, the company launched an energy storage system called Ampd Enertainer, which aims to replace lead acid battery, Uninterruptible Power Supply systems (UPSs) and diesel generators primarily in countries affected by frequent blackouts.

Unlike many related companies such as Tesla and Sonnen, Ampd Enertainer is primarily aimed at on-grid energy storage.

Ampd Enertainer uses 1,792 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries cells, with each Ampd Silo offering a storage capacity of 16.8 kWh.
