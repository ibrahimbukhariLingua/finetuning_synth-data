The large-scale conglomerate is active in healthcare, energy, building and industrial systems, real estate, e-commerce, and transport; with 22% annual growth in recent years. The company is wholly owned and operated by the Link family. The chairman and CEO, Harald Link, is a noted polo player and philanthropist.


## History

B.Grimm was founded in 1878 when German pharmacist Bernhard Grimm and his Austrian partner, Erwin Mueller, started a chemist's shop, the Siam Dispensary, on Oriental Avenue off New Road. The shop, one of the earliest incorporated businesses in the country, prospered and it was soon appointed official pharmacist to the Thai royal family.

As early as 1900, the company had secured a partnership with global heavyweights like Siemens Corporation. In 1903, Adolf Link was hired as a manager to help expand the growing business. After King Chulalongkorn returned from his grand tour in Europe, he began putting in place measures to modernize the country to bring it more in line with European nations.

Following the outbreak of World War I, all of the assets in Siam (then Thailand) of Adolf Link, a German national, were seized on orders of the British government and was sent with his wife, Erma, and their two children, Herbert and Gerhard, to concentration camps in India.

The Links had much credibility in Thailand and they knew the Thais had not taken away their assets on their initiative. The family returned to Thailand in 1920 after the war had ended in 1918. In 1928, Prince Bhanurangrsi built on his property the new premises for the company at Wang Burapha, and King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambhai Barni presided over the opening of the new offices.

Herbert Link reopened the company in Thailand in 1949, while brother and partner Gerhard remained in Germany to help expand the B.Grimm name in Europe. In 1953, Gerhard Link was appointed Thailand's honorary consul and later its consul general in Hamburg.

Over the next decade, the brothers expanded the business so that by 1964 it included engineering and equipment for healthcare, power generation, telecommunications, air conditioning, and mechanical engineering.

The Princess Mother opened the company's new offices and warehouse on New Petchaburi Road in January 1967. In 1975, Herbert's wife, Alma, was bestowed the title of *Khunying* (equivalent to 'Dame') by the King Rama IX in recognition of her work for various charitable foundations. She was the first foreign woman to receive such an honor in Thailand.

In 1988, Dr. Gerhard Link's son Harald Link expanded B.Grimm into power generation, manufacturing, and real estate, and also forged joint ventures with some of the world's largest corporations.

Harald Link, who had been raised in Germany and had graduated from University of St. Gallen business school, had joined his uncle Herbert in Thailand in 1978 to help manage the growing business. He moved to Thailand with his wife, Princess Assunta of Liechtenstein, a descendant of Prince Aloys of Liechtenstein.

In 1992, the company built new factories and work also began on another new head office. Soon afterward, B.Grimm expanded into power generation, bio-diesel production, and the lifestyle industry. The company has since expanded into power generation which now accounts for 80% of total revenues.

*Forbes* magazine reported that Harald Link's daughter, Caroline Link, is being trained to play a key part in the business. She was named as one of "12 women to watch" by Forbes.


## Logo

B.Grimm's logo comes from the Phra Prang of Wat Arun ('Temple of Dawn'). A prang is a Buddhist tower-like spire, usually richly carved, that was especially symbolic during Thailand's Ayutthaya Kingdom (1350–1767) and Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782-1932). Phra Prang was selected as the company's logo as the site of the first B.Grimm & Co. by the Chao Phraya River overlooked the Phra Prang of the Temple of Dawn.
