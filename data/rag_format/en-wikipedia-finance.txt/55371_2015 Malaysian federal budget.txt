## Supplementary supply bill

On 23 March 2015, the Government tabled a supplementary supply bill to augment its Budget 2015 by an additional RM2.2 billion, some two months after the prime minister revised this. The Bill was tabled for the first reading after question time today by Deputy Finance Minister Chua Tee Yong. The bulk of the requested amount — RM1.2 billion — will be channelled to the Treasury's consolidated fund, while the Education Ministry will be allocated with RM428 million. The Public Services Department will receive RM287 million and the Health Ministry, RM200 million. The Federal Territories Ministry and the Home Ministry will respectively get RM34 million and RM26 million. The Dewan Rakyat approved the Supplementary Supply Bill (2014) 2015 after it was debated at the committee level on 1 April 2015. The bill allocated a supplementary financial allocation of RM2,223,520,310 to several ministries as additional management expenditure for services.

Last year, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak tabled a budget of RM273.9 billion, an increase of RM9.8 billion from 2014. He revised this in January following a sharp drop in global crude oil price and the devastating flood that ravaged the east coast states in the country. Despite announcing cuts to operating expenditure that could trim RM5.5 billion from government spending, Najib maintained that allocations for development totalling RM48.5 billion will be maintained.
