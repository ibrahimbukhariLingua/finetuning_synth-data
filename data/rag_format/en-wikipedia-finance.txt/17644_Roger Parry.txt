In both 2011 and 2012 Parry was the Chairman of the Global Festival of Media held in Montreux

In November 2010 Parry was named by bookmakers Paddy Power as the 11/8 favourite to become the next Chairman of the BBC Trust – a role which in fact went to Lord Patten

In 2009 he was commissioned by the UK's Conservative Party to write a report on the future of local media. His proposals on local TV were subsequently adopted as Government policy by Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

During 2006 he was linked with a number of private equity bids including one for the retail chain HMV and another for the British television broadcaster ITV. He was twice forced by the UK Takeover Panel to deny rumours that he was about to bid for ITV.

Between 2000 and 2005, he was frequently mentioned as a possible bidder for the radio station Capital 95.8 and in 2003 the CEO of Capital said that if Parry did make an offer it would be rejected out of hand. According to The Guardian newspaper, Parry responded to this by saying: "It would be like Ann Widdecombe turning down a date from Brad Pitt".

In 2003 it was suggested that Parry as Chairman of Johnston Press might have agreed to the sacking of the editor of a local paper in Hartlepool who had been critical of his local MP Peter Mandelson at the request of the Prime Minister Tony Blair. Parry was highly critical of the Hartlepool Mail editor in a speech he gave to the Johnston Press Editors' conference. The attack was so pointed that North East Press (a division of Johnston Press) Editorial Director Andrew Smith raised the speech with Chief Executive Tim Bowdler. Mandelson, Blair and Parry had been contemporaries at Oxford University in the late 1970s. All three men subsequently denied the allegation. Hartlepool Mail editor Harry Blackwood subsequently accepted an out of court settlement from Johnston Press.
