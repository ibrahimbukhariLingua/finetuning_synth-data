# CoreFirst Bank & Trust



**CoreFirst Bank & Trust** (formerly **Commerce Bank & Trust**) is an American community bank headquartered in Topeka, Kansas.

The bank also offers Internet Banking, Internet Billpayer, E-Statements, Debit & ATM Cards, a network of ATMs with the option of English or Spanish, and an Automated Phone Information System in English and Spanish.
