Klaipėda Free Economic Zone


# Klaipėda Free Economic Zone



**Klaipėda Free Economic Zone** (Klaipėda FEZ) (Lithuanian: Klaipėdos laisvoji ekonominė zona) is the first free economic zone in the Baltic region. It was established in 1996 and officially launched in 2002.

Klaipėda FEZ covers 412 hectares of land, primarily consisting of manufacturing plants, logistics operations, and a business park. It is located in Klaipėda, Lithuania, a port city on the Baltic Sea, with road and railway connections to the rest of continental Europe.

The first steps for the establishment of the Klaipėda zone were undertaken in 1996. In 1997, a management company was selected after reviewing five proposals. The Klaipėda FEZ is managed by Klaipėda FEZ Management Company (Lithuanian: *Klaipėdos LEZ Valdymo Bendrovė*), a private limited liability company. The Baltic Fund, an investment fund, financed through foreign investors which owned about 60% of the management company. The remaining shares are owned by city enterprises, municipalities, and the government of the Lithuanian Republic. In 2001, the Rockefeller Foundation sold its shares to Pierre J. Everaert Family Trust based in Demarest New Jersey, which then became the largest private shareholder of the KFEZ.

Another set of obstacles was raised during Lithuania's negotiations for accession to the European Union. Klaipėda FEZ began its activities in December 2001. In 2003, Thailand-based Indorama announced an investment of 80M euros into a plastic production factory. To further attract investors to FEZ, Lithuanian-based companies have been allowed to participate since 2004. A year later, the FEZ began plans for expansion and further development of its land, requesting assistance from structural funds of the European Union. By the end of 2007, FEZ attracted some 600M litas (174M euros) of investments. The total attracted investments since 2002 are 783M Eur.

Currently, more than 5000 employees work at the FEZ investor and supporting companies.
