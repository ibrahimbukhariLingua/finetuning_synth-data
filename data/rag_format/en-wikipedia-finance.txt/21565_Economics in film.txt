Economics in film


# Economics in film



Portrayals of **economics in film** include the depiction of economic principles, themes, and concepts within cinematic narratives. Films often use economic elements as part of their stories, even when not explicitly focused on economics. Films can incorporate economic ideas into their narratives, often without the audience consciously recognizing them.

The integration of economic principles include portrayals of consumption decisions, resource allocation, and production costs. Film has been used as a tool to illustrate economic principles, and numerous academic and popular works explore its potential in teaching economics. By embedding economic ideas into storytelling, films reveal the pervasive nature of economic principles and their relevance to everyday life, illustrating the connections between theoretical concepts and real-world decision-making.


## Background

Economics is an inescapable reality of human existence, as noted by Alfred Marshall, who described the discipline as examining "that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of well-being". The omnipresence of economics in daily life, from personal budgeting decisions to global resource allocation, ensures its inevitable presence in cinematic storytelling. Films as diverse as *Workers Leaving the Lumi√®re Factory* (1895) and *A Corner in Wheat* (1909) illustrate how economic themes have been central to film since its inception.

Film's depiction of economic principles mirrors the work of economists. Just as economic models simplify reality to focus on critical factors, films create symbolic worlds with enough realism to be credible. This parallelism extends to the exploration of human behavior under constraints such as laws, institutions, and social norms. For instance, films like *The Big Short* (2015) and *The Wolf of Wall Street* (2013) not only depict financial crises and speculative behavior but also challenge audiences to reflect on the motivations and consequences of economic decision-making.

The bidirectional relationship between film and economics is noteworthy. While economic conditions influence the content and themes of films, films significantly shape public perceptions of economics and economic policies. The disparity between the reach of films like *The Big Short*, which sold 8.2 million tickets in the United States alone, and Thomas Piketty's *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* (2013), which sold 2.5 million copies worldwide, underscores film's broader cultural impact. Additionally, films such as *Blood Diamond* (2006) and *Dark Waters* (2019) have served as catalysts for socio-economic discourse and policy change.

Cinematic narratives often convey a dismissive attitude toward economics and markets, reflecting broader societal anxieties and misunderstandings. Such portrayals reveal valuable insights into public attitudes and the generational perspectives of filmmakers and audiences. While critics often accuse filmmakers of bias or ignorance, these depictions serve as a cultural commentary on the discipline's perceived limitations and societal implications.
