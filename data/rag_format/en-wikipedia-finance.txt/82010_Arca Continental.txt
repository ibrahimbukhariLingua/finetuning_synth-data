## History


### Arca Continental

Arca Continental was created in 2001 as a merger of 3 old already-established bottlers in Mexico: Argos, Arma, and Procor. This merger made what people know as the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico. At that time, the company distributed its products only at Northern Mexico.


### Merger with Continental

In 2011, Arca and Grupo Continental—a Coca-Cola bottler headquartered in Tampico, Tamaulipas—agreed to merge into Arca Continental. Estimates at the time of the merger suggested that sales would be about 1.2bn.


### Acquisitions

Embotelladoras Arca Continental fuelled its growth during the 2000's by acquiring companies in Mexico, Argentina, and Ecuador. In 2017, Arca Continental announced the closing of a transaction with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Great Plains Coca-Cola Bottling Company. This acquisition operates in some areas of the Southwestern United States, including the Texas, parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In May 2018, Arca Continental announced the construction of the first new bottling plant in the United States in over a decade. The new $250 million plant has been fully operational since March 2020.
