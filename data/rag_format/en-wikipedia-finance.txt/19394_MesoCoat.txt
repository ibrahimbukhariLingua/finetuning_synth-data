## History

MesoCoat was spun out of advanced materials company Powdermet, Inc. in 2007 to be an independent firm. One of the core technologies acquired and licensed for MesoCoat's start-up phase was developed at the Department Of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

In 2009, Abakan, Inc. acquired a controlling interest in MesoCoat.

In 2011, MesoCoat signed a cooperation agreement with Petrobras to help verify the effectiveness of the CermaClad™ process and finance an Euclid plant.

In 2015, Abakan, Inc. acquired 100% of MesoCoat, Inc.

Mesocoat was put into receivership in 2015 by U.S. Federal Court Judge Denise Cote of the Southern District of New York. Judge Cote appointed Robert W. Seiden as Receiver who steered the company to settlement of a dispute with its creditors and resolved a litigation.


## Technology

Since 2007, MesoCoat has funded its primary research and development activities through government grants, third-party licensing arrangements, and venture and equity financing.
