Certified International Investment Analyst


# Certified International Investment Analyst



**Certified International Investment Analyst** (**CIIA**) is a global finance designation offered by the **Association of Certified International Investment Analysts** (**ACIIA**) to financial professionals; candidates may be financial analysts, portfolio managers or investment advisors.

The CIIA maintains standards both at the national and international levels: ACIIA tests candidates at the local level (at their home country), and, having cleared those country specific exams, at the common international level.
Because of similarity in exam structure and difficulty, CIIA is sometimes described as the "European version of the CFA(says who?)". ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
