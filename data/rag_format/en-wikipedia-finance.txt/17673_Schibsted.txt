## History

In 1839, Christian Michael Schibsted founded the publishing company *Chr. Schibsteds Forlag* and in 1860, he started publishing the newspaper *Christiania Adresseblad*, from 1885 known as *Aftenposten*. In 1966, Schibsted also acquired *Verdens Gang* (*VG*). These were Norway's two largest newspapers, with *VG* surpassing *Aftenposten* in 1981. In 1989, under the leadership of Tinius Nagell-Erichsen, Schibsted went from being a family-owned company to a corporation, and was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 1992. From 1992 to 2006, Schibsted owned part of TV 2, and in 2004 Schibsted bought part of TV 4 Sweden. While retaining its newspapers division, the company later shifted its focus from television to Internet classifieds/marketplaces, such as Finn.no [no], Blocket.se [sv],Tori.fi [fi], and InfoJobs. In 2021 Schibsted acquired dba.dk [dk] and Bilbasen [dk].
