# Optimer Pharmaceuticals



**Optimer Pharmaceuticals Inc** (Nasdaq: OPTR) was a biopharmaceutical company, originally headquartered in San Diego, California, and later moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, United States.

The company focused on developing specialty drugs to treat gastrointestinal infections and related diseases. In 2011, it received regulatory approval for the first antibacterial drug, Dificid, in 25 years approved to treat certain types of diarrhea (i.e., *Clostridioides difficile* induced diarrhea) in adults.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ But sales of the drug Dificid failed to meet expectations and the drug faced strong competition from cheaper generic alternatives.
