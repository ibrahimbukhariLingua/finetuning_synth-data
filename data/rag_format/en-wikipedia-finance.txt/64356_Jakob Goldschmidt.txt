# Jakob Goldschmidt



**Jakob Goldschmidt** (also Jacob Goldschmidt; born 31 December 1882 in Eldagsen; died 23 September 1955 in New York) was a German-Jewish banker.


## Career

Goldschmidt studied banking from H. Oppenheimer in Hanover. In 1907, he worked at the Nationalbank für Deutschland in Berlin. In 1909, Goldschmidt founded the private bank Schwarz. Goldschmidt held up to 123 supervisory board mandates, including in Ufa, founded in 1917, and IG Farben (1931–1932).


## Art Collector

Goldschmidt's extensive art collection, which was auctioned off by the Nazis in the 1940s, has been the subject of restitution claims. In 1963, a Dutch court ruled that an Honore Daumier bronze sculpture, *Ratiapil*, should be returned from a museum in Cologne. In 2002, the heirs of Jakob Goldschmidt sought the return of a painting *Portrait of a Young Girl in a Bow Window*, attributed to *Nikolaus Alexander Mair von Landshut* from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
