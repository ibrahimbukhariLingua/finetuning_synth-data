## Business activity

In the late 1980s, Zhukov founded the cooperative "Byte" and started the business of selling personal computers.

In the early 1990s, jointly with his acquaintances Leonid Lebedev and Mark Garber, he founded the cooperative named "Sintez". In 1991-1992, Sintez started to trade oil and oil products.

In 1992, Sintez founded a company named "Negusneft" that acquired a license to explore and develop a small Varyngskoe field in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District. Also, Sintez acquired 10% share in "Nizhnevartovskneftegaz" (the core of the future company TNK), 15% in "Rosneft-Sakhalinmorneftegaz" and 15% in the Yaroslavl Oil Processing Plant. In 1997, the group’s turnover reached US$1.5 billion.

In 1993, the group began to cooperate with the Odesa Oil Processing Plant. At the same time the group were making investments to the port development. The investments amounted to US$100 million. By the end of the nineties the capacity of the oil intake, storage and transshipment facility reached 25 million tons per year.

Sintez transshipped oil through the Odesa port terminal and arranged for oil trading in the international market through its traders located in the UK, Switzerland and Finland.

In 1995, the group acquired a Ukrainian bank which later became Marine Transport Bank. Initially its operations were limited to the processing of the group’s transactions but later it expanded its operations and started to service public agencies and enterprises in the Odesa Region.

In the late 1990s, the Sintez business partners decided to divide the business. The transshipment business and the bank in Ukraine passed to Zhukov, while the Russian assets - to Lebedev.

In 1998, Zhukov started to cooperate with Lukoil. A joint venture "Luk-Sintez Oil" was established to supply the Lukoil-produced oil. In 1999, the company acquired the Odesa Oil Processing Plant. In 2000, Zhukov sold his share in the company to Lukoil.

In the beginning of 2000, Zhukov consolidated his transshipment business in Ukraine under the Transit brand. Later in 2001-2002, the business was sold.

In 2004, Marine Transport Bank was sold.

After the sale of the transshipment business and bank Alexander Zhukov focused on investing in Russia. The Interfinance group was founded with "Interfinance SA", Switzerland as the headquarter company. The group invested in various sectors such as port infrastructure, oil and oil extraction, food industry, portfolio loans, construction, including road construction, development, land assets, portfolio investments.


### Key projects of the Interfinance group

In 2003-2007, Zhukov jointly with Ziyavudin Magomedov and Boris Davletyarov conducted successfully portfolio investments in the Gazprom, Sberbank and Transneft shares.

In 2004, Zhukov acquired a considerable lot of shares in a UK oil and gas company - JKX Oil & Gas plc. through his corporate vehicle "Glengary Overseas Ltd". In 2007, he sold a part of his stake to the structures owned by Ihor Kolomoyskyi. At the time the entities of Zhukov and Kolomoisky were the two major shareholders in JKX. In 2009-2010, the shares in JKX lost 1/3 in value and in the next two years the loss in value reached 80%. In 2013, the major shareholders attempted to change the management of the company, however the directors then in office attempted not to allow the same stating that the two shareholders were acting in concert. In spite of being informed by the shareholders to the contrary JKX nevertheless decided to restrict the shareholders’ voting rights claiming the information provided being incorrect. The shareholders initiated court proceedings to protect their rights. The proceedings went through all of the three instances in the UK. At the end of 2015 the Supreme Court of the UK finally resolved the matter by holding that JKX by restricting the shareholders’ rights had acted with improper purpose, namely, with a view to influence on the outcome of the voting at the general meeting (and not with a view to encourage the shareholders to provide information). However, the issue of whether the shareholders were acting in concert and the nature of arrangements between them was not the subject of the dispute and was neither reviewed nor assessed by the court.

In 2005, the group acquired the Ice-Fili ice-cream production and sale business later reorganized into Iceberry group of companies. Interfinance continues to own and develop this business.

In 2005, Zhukov started transport logistics business in Russia. He acquired a site and built a bulk cargo (sulfur) transshipment terminal at the port of Ust-Luga, Russia. Currently the construction of the second stage - a mineral fertilizer transshipment terminal - is being finalized.

In 2007, the Interfinance group sold its Russian gas asset – the Koshekhablskoe field in Adygeya to JKX.

Early in 2016, Glengary sold its shares in JKX and Zhukov ceased to be a shareholder therein.
