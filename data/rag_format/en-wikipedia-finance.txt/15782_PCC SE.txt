# PCC SE



**PCC SE** is an international chemicals, silicon and logistics corporation. Headquartered in Duisburg, Germany, the PCC Group has about 3,300 employees worldwide. It comprises 66 subsidiaries located at 41 sites in 17 countries, with production facilities in Europe, Asia and the United States. The sole shareholder of the group's parent and holding company PCC SE is Waldemar Preussner, chairman of the supervisory board.


## History

In October 1993, Waldemar Preussner and partners established *Petro Carbo Chem Rohstoffhandelsgesellschaft mbH* (today PCC Trade & Services GmbH), a commodity trading company, in Duisburg. In 1998, PCC AG was formed as a spin-off and in February 2007, converted into a Societas Europaea (SE). In 1998, PCC SE was one of the first medium-sized German companies to start issuing bonds directly, independently of banks. Since then, corporate bonds have formed the main financing instrument of the group holding company.

The PCC group has expanded and diversified through acquisitions and project investments. Particularly in Poland and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe, PCC acquired various previously state-owned companies, which it then modernized and expanded. In 2010, PCC completed the takeover of a Polish chemicals producer, known today as PCC Rokita SA, the largest group subsidiary.

PCC SE has placed minority stakes of two Polish chemical companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, PCC Rokita SA (initial public offering in 2014) and PCC Exol SA (2012). Logistics company PCC Intermodal S.A. (IPO in 2009) was delisted from the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2018. As a major divestiture, in 2009, PCC sold its Polish subgroup PCC Logistics to Deutsche Bahn AG (today DB Cargo Polska).

Investments further afield include US specialty surfactants developer PCC Chemax, Inc. Activities are also being pursued in Asia through the acquisition of a total of 50% of Thai polyols and polyurethane producer IRPC Polyol Company Ltd. In Iceland, PCC commissioned, in 2018, a silicon metal production plant at a cost of around US$300 million powered by geothermal energy.

In 2023, PCC generated consolidated revenue of €993.6 million. Earnings before interest and other financial items, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to €112.3 million, and earnings before taxes (EBT) were €-20.8 million.
