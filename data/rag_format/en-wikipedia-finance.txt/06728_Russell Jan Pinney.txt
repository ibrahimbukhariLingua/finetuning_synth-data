# Russell Jan Pinney



**R. Jan Pinney**, CLU, ChFC, CPCU (born December 11, 1946) is an American businessman, author, speaker, and consultant. He received national attention for various issues discussed during his tenure on the Roseville Joint Union High School District Board of Trustees. He has also testified before Assembly and Senate committees on insurance and finance. Jan is a prominent and active figure within the insurance industry where he advocates at the State and National levels for common-sense laws, transparency in regulatory oversight, and a consumer-first focus on insurance company product designs, sales distribution, and consumer protection. Most recently, he has led a coalition of NAILBA, LIDMA, and NAIFA leaders in fighting for an insurance agent exemption to the TCPA Laws that currently prevents a licensed agent from contacting a consumer (their client) regarding an existing insurance policy via telephone without written permission. Under the current rules, agents may only have telephone contact with their clients without written permission for a period of 18-months from the inception of a new insurance policy or are subject to fines.
