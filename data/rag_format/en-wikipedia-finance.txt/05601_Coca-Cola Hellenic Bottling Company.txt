## History

*Hellenic Bottling Company S.A.* (Greek: Ελληνική Εταιρεία Εμφιαλώσεως) was incorporated under the laws of Greece in 1969, with headquarters in Athens. The Coca-Cola Company granted to the company its bottling rights in the country in 1969. In August 2000 Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. acquired Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd, the former European operations of Coca-Cola Amatil, and formed *Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A.*

In October 2012, the company announced that it was moving its operational headquarters to Switzerland and would switch its main market listing to London. This was a major blow to the Athens stock market, as Coca-Cola Hellenic was its largest listed company by value. Reasons for the move included better access to financing and a move away from crisis ridden Greece, which had prompted ratings agencies to downgrade its credit over the summer to three notches above "junk" level.

On 29 April 2013 Coca-Cola HBC AG, now a Swiss holding company, was admitted to the London Stock Exchange’s main market.

On 11 September 2013 Coca-Cola HBC AG announced its inclusion into the FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices. Coca-Cola HBC was named the industry leader among beverage companies in the 2014 Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

On 24 July 2014 Coca-Cola HBC AG announced its delisting of its American depositary receipts (ADRs) from the New York Stock Exchange, the termination of its ADR programme, and the deregistration and termination of its reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In October 2017 the company's chief executive officer, Dimitris Lois, died after a period of illness. On 7 December 2017, Zoran Bogdanović was appointed as new chief executive officer by the board of directors.

In January 2019, the Coca-Cola HBC announced that its carbonated water brand Valser would use captured carbon from the direct air capture company Climeworks, and in 2021, a Coca-Cola HBC official stated in an interview with *The Wall Street Journal* that 30 percent of their production was done with captured carbon from Climeworks.

On 18 February 2019, the company announced a deal valued at €260 million to acquire Serbian food company Bambi from Mid Europa Partners.
