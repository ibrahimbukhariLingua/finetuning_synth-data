## Views

In 2007 Chandler began advocating the dollar and has maintained that viewpoint throughout the crisis.

His new book picks up a theme presented in the first book and develops it at length. Drawing on the work of Charles Conant, a late 19th century/early 20th century journalist and strategic adviser to senior government official, Chandler suggests that the biggest challenge of the market economy comes from its successes (not it failures) and these cannot be simply reformed away. Capitalism produces more wealth than it can absorb. The surplus generates instability and forces social relationships to change in order to accommodate the surplus.
