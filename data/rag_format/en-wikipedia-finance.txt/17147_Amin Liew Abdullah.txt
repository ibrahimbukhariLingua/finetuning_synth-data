**Mohd Amin Liew bin Abdullah** (Chinese: 刘光明; pinyin: *Liú Guāngmíng*; born December 1962) or also referred to as **Dato Dr Amin**, is a Bruneian politician and businessperson whom is the incumbent second Minister of Finance and Economy II and the Minister at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) since 2018, and the chairman of the Brunei Economic Development Board (BEDB) and Bank Islam Brunei Darussalam (BIBD).


## Education

Amin earned a Bachelor's degree from Queen Mary College, University of London in 1984, as well as a Master's degree and a PhD from Imperial College, University of London, in 1989 and 1993, respectively. He has been a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) since 2004. He belongs to CFA Singapore as well.


## Early career

Prior to joining the Brunei government, Amin spent the middle of the 1990s working as a crude oil trader for Brunei Shell Petroleum after returning from the United Kingdom, where he had previously spent the late 1980s and early 1990s as a research analyst for ICI Finance. Amin sits on the boards of numerous Brunei Government-affiliated businesses in a variety of industries, such as telecommunications, healthcare, hospitality, oil and gas, information technology, and education.

Amin held the position of CEO of Darussalam Assets (DA), an investment holding company owned by the Minister For Finance Corporation, Brunei Darussalam. Before joining DA, Amin joined the BIA in October 1997, and in May 2005, he was named the organisation's managing director. He was promoted to the position of permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and permanent secretary of the Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources in October 2008. His achievement is particularly impressive considering that Prince Jefri, whose Amedeo business collapsed in 1998, leaving approximately US$16 billion in debt, recruited him. On 20 January 2012, he was named the new Finance and Business Development Director of Progen Holdings after the Nominating Committee emphasized his extensive commercial, research, and development skills, as well as his prior employment with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources. The company's announcement on the removal of Amin Liew from the board of directors of Progen Holdings Ltd became affective on 9 February 2015.

On 8 October 2018, he was appointed as the chairman of the BEDB. At the 2019 Legislative Council (LegCo) Meeting, he recommended a government budget of B$5.86 billion for the 2019–2020 fiscal year. He stated on 14 March 2019 that CFLD (Singapore) Investment Pte Ltd's financial difficulties had caused the construction of Brunei's special economic zone to be postponed.
