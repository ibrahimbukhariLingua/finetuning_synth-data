## History

The university was founded in 1976 and received full accreditation in 2003 from the Distance Education and Training Council.

In 2009, the DETC's scope of authority was expanded to include professional doctorates and the program was resumed.

Since 2006, the university has offered the degree of Master of Education. In 2010, it began offering the Doctor of Business Administration and B.S. in Business Administration.
