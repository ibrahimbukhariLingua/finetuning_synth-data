## History

Leclanché was founded in 1909 in Yverdon-les-Bains in the Swiss canton of Vaud. The company is named after the Leclanché cell invented and patented by the French scientist Georges Leclanché in 1866. Through the integration of a spin-off from the German research organization Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft in 2006, the company pivoted from a traditional battery manufacturer to become a developer and manufacturer of lithium-ion cells.

In 2017, the company announced a trial to install energy storage batteries at sites owned by Dutch charging station operator Fastned.

Since 2020, the company has been quite active in the production of heavy duty industrial battery packs for usage in rail, marine and heavy-duty ground vehicles applications.

As of 2021, Leclanché was producing about 400,000 cells (pouch/flat cells) per year.


## Technology

Through a licensed ceramic separator technology and focus on lithium–titanate technology, Leclanché manufactures large-format lithium-ion cells. At the end of the second quarter 2012, Leclanché started operations of its first production line with an installed annual capacity of up to 76 MWh in lithium titanate cells.
