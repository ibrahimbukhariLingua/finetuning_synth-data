## History

Banco de Occidente began operations as a commercial banking corporation, duly incorporated, on May 3, 1965, under the administration of the first manager, Mr. Alfonso DÃ­az. Its orientation and scope initially maintained a regional tone during the first years, a period during which the development of the banking sector was really slow.

The first offices outside Cali were opened in Palmira, Pereira and Armenia. In 1970, the Bank had a network of 15 offices, a net worth of approximately 74 million pesos and total assets of around 685 million.
