# Wealth of Khamenei family



The **Khamenei family**, led by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is reported to control substantial wealth and assets, both personally and through affiliated organizations.


## Ali Khamenei

Investigations have revealed that Ayatollah Khamenei oversees a financial empire valued at approximately $95 billion. This wealth is primarily managed through the Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO), also known as Setad. Setad has amassed a vast portfolio by systematically seizing thousands of properties, often under the pretext that they were abandoned. These properties belong to various Iranians, including religious minorities and expatriates.


## Mojtaba Khamenei

Mojtaba Khamenei, the Supreme Leader's second eldest son, is reported to have accumulated wealth exceeding $3 billion. His assets are allegedly distributed across banks in the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Venezuela, and several African countries. Additionally, Mojtaba is said to possess approximately $300 million in gold and diamonds. He has also acquired extensive land near Mashhad, transforming it into personal property.


## Masoud Khamenei

Masoud, another of Ayatollah Khamenei's sons, manages several of his father's institutions. He reportedly holds over $400 million in banks in France and the UK, with an additional $100 million in Tehran. Masoud also controls the sales of Renault vehicles in Iran, further contributing to his wealth.


## Meysam Khamenei

Meysam, the youngest son, is married to the daughter of a prominent Iranian bazaar merchant. He partners with his brother Masoud in the Renault enterprise, receiving a commission from each vehicle sold. Meysam's wealth is estimated at over $200 million, with around $10 million allocated for domestic trade.


## Affiliated Organizations

Beyond personal wealth, the Khamenei family exerts control over significant economic entities:


### Mostazafan Foundation

Mostazafan Foundation was originally established as the Pahlavi Foundation. It was renamed after the Islamic Revolution. The foundation's assets grew substantially post-revolution, encompassing numerous factories, agribusinesses, construction firms, mines, and commercial companies.


### Astan Quds Razavi

Astan Quds Razavi manages the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and its associated endowments. It holds vast assets, including land, businesses, and industries, contributing significantly to the family's influence.

These organizations, while presented as charitable entities, have been criticized for lacking transparency and allegedly serving the ruling elite's interests.
