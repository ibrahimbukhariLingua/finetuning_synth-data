Asia Media was the first Malaysian company to be awarded 10-year licenses to operate three (3) blocks of L-Band Spectrums for both fixed and mobile broadcasting. The licenses cover both free and paid broadcasting models. The company opted for DMB-T technology for its mobile TV application.


### Bright Packaging

On 10 February 2014, non-executive director Datuk Seri Syed Ali Alhabshee has ceased to be a substantial shareholder of the company following the disposal of his entire shareholding in a direct business transaction to Wong. Wong currently holds a 32.81% stake in Bright Packaging. In October 2013, Wong emerged as a dominant shareholder in Bright Packaging Industry Berhad, a main board listed company on Bursa Malaysia. This is the second public-listed company in which the 31-year-old Wong has a controlling stake after Asia Media. Wong acquired a 22.73% equity stake in the packaging company which also owns two freehold sites with a combined area of 136,998 square feet in Prime Klang valley's Subang Hi-Tech Industrial Park where its headquarters and factories are located. As of 31 August 2013, debt-free Bright Packaging had cash of $19.94 million while net assets per share stood at 62 cents. The market reacted positively after news of Wong's investment was made public and the stock increased another 17% on news of its expansion plan through rights issue. News of Wong's interest in taking the company private were denied by the Board in its annual general meeting held on 24 February 2014. Wong has quietly built up his stake in the company and currently holds 32.81% which is just short of the 33% threshold required to trigger a mandatory general offer.


### Techfast Holdings

In May 2014, Wong made an offer of to acquire Techfast Holdings. The offer was submitted on the same day that Techfast held its AGM raising speculation that the offer may turn hostile. Wong had previously built a 14.45% stake in the company. TechFast noted its listing status is expected to be maintained should Wong's offer be accepted. This offer has been perceived as a takeover, an attempt by Wong to control three public-listed companies. Techfast Holdings's conditional voluntary takeover offer by Wong to acquire all the remaining shares in the company could only gather 22.48% of the share capital in Techfast with the offer tabled. The offer failed to meet the acceptance conditions within the proposed timeline.

Since the failed takeover by Wong in May 2014, Wong through his personal investment company Wong SK Holdings Sdn Bhd, has quietly emerged as the second largest shareholder of Techfast Holdings bearing 24,518,700 shares which equivalent to 16% of the share capital.

According to its Annual Report 2014, the largest shareholder is AVB Ventures Sdn Bhd which is controlled by its Managing Director Mr. Yap Yoon Seng, bearing 18.42% of its share capital. It remain to be seen that Wong emergence as the second largest shareholder of Techfast Holdings will again turn hostile to the incumbent Board of Directors.
