# BroadVoice



**Broadvoice** is a privately owned company headquartered in Northridge, California. They provide Voice over IP (VOIP) cloud-based telecommunications services to small, medium, and enterprise businesses in the United States. Broadvoice offers telephone services, unified communications as a service (UCaaS), SIP Trunking, telecommunications network and security, along with virtual call centers, so business customers can use voice and video communications via a broadband Internet connection or cellular phone.


## History

Broadvoice started as a pager company, Rampage Cellular, in the San Fernando Valley in the early 1990s. After the Northridge Earthquake in 1994, its founders Jim Murphy and Ari Ramenzani lost all their inventory stored in their apartment due to flooding of an aquarium, and used the funds from FEMA to lease their first office. This led to the founding of DSL Extreme, a residential broadband internet provider, in 1999.

After the sale of DSL Extreme in 2005 Jim and Ari founded Phone Power in 2005, a residential VOIP Telecommunications service offering telephone services throughout the United States and Canada.

In 2012, Phone Power acquired Broadvoice; that same year, Phone Power rebranded itself as Broadvoice.

Before the acquisition by Phone Power, Broadvoice was a subsidiary of Convergent Networks, which was founded in December 2003 by David Epstein and Nathan Stratton and was based in the Billerica, Massachusetts area as of 2008. Convergent was purchased by Eastern Photonics, a subsidiary of Global NAPs, a competitive local exchange carrier.

Jim Murphy serves as the CEO of Broadvoice.
Sam Ghahremanpour serves as President and is responsible for corporate strategy, business development, and brand development.
George Mitsopoulos serves as the chief operating officer (COO). He joined Broadvoice with the re-acquisition of IKANO's Broadband internet provider DSL Extreme in 2015.
