## History

In 1959 German businesses in Thailand founded a "German Business Group" and soon led to the creation of bilateral Chamber of Commerce.

The German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC) was officially founded by 57 German and Thai business representatives on 19 July 1962. The inauguration ceremony took place at the Erawan Hotel, Bangkok. By 1965, the GTCC had grown to 100 member companies, and to around 300 during the following 20 years. Since 2017, total membership has been more than 600, making it one of the largest foreign chambers of commerce in Thailand.
