List of countries by age structure


# List of countries by age structure



The following **list of countries by age structure** sorts the countries of the world according to the age distribution of their population. The population is divided into three groups:

* Ages 0 to 14 years: children.
* Ages 15 to 64 years: working population or adults.
* Over the age of 65: elderly, senior citizens.

The age structure of a country has a strong impact on society and the economy. If the proportion of 0–14-year-olds is very high, there may be a so-called youth bulge. If, on the other hand, the proportion of over 65 is very high, the social systems of a country can be heavily burdened.
