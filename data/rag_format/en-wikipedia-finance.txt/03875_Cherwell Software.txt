# Cherwell Software



**Cherwell Software**, LLC, was a privately held American technology company specializing in IT service management software. The company headquarters is in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It also has offices in Swindon, UK. The company name is taken from the River Cherwell, which runs through Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire, England.


## History

Cherwell was founded in 2004 by Vance Brown, a former CEO of GoldMine Software (later, a product by Ivanti), Arlen S. Feldman and Timothy G. Pfeifer. Cherwell announced their first product in 2007.


### Venture capital

In November 2012, Cherwell received a $25 million investment from Insight Venture Partners. The investment was highly unusual for the industry: in exchange for their capital investment, Insight Venture was only granted common stock in the company and did not receive control over day to day operations.
CEO Vance Brown told the media that he did not want to worry about having an exit strategy.

In January 2013, the Service Desk Institute accredited Cherwell service management.

On February 27, 2017, Cherwell secured a $50 million investment from investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR).
In January 2018, Craig Harper resigned as CEO, and was replaced by Vance Brown on an interim basis.
On April 4, 2018, an additional $172 million investment from KKR included acquiring much of the Insight Venture Partner stake, made them a majority owner.
In August 2018, Brown left to lead the National Cybersecurity Center, and Sam Gilliland became chief executive.

On June 4, 2020, Cherwell announced Rob Salvagno of KKR and Drew Harman of Insight Venture Partners joined their board. Dave Welsh from KKR, a board member since 2018 became chairman.
In January 2021, Ivanti announced it would acquire Cherwell for undisclosed terms.
