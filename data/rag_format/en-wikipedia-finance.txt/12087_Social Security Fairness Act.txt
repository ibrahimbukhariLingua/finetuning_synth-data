Social Security Fairness Act


# Social Security Fairness Act



The **Social Security Fairness Act** is a United States law that repealed the Social Security Government Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination Provision. The bill passed the House in November 2024 and then passed the Senate in December. It was signed into law by President Biden on January 5, 2025.


## Background

In the United States, Social Security offers government-sponsored Retirement Insurance Benefits to retired individuals that have reached 40 quarters of work, following the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings formula; this is generally applicable to all workers, but there are some exceptions.

Indeed, over fears that the system would run out of money in 1983, however, Congress passed the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which created the Windfall Elimination Provision, which reduces the benefit formula for those with a non-covered pension as well as qualified for social security benefits. Those with uncovered pensions include some government employees, railroad workers, non-profit workers, and teachers, among others.
