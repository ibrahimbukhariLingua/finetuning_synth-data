**Stepping down from Bupa**

Bupa Chairman, Roger Davis commented: *"Our deepest thanks go to Evelyn for all that she has contributed to Bupa. She leaves the organisation in excellent shape. The hallmark of her leadership has been her systematic focus on Bupa’s customers, putting them front and centre right across the organisation. She has also transformed many of the fundamentals across the Group, investing in technology and operational resilience, and strengthening internal controls and risk management.
