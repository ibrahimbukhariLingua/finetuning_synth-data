However, reported GDP per capita is below the national average, and the regional wage levels are one-sixth below the national average. However, the likelihood of not being paid regularly is also below the national average. The discrepancies between these data and positive optimism of individuals can be influenced by the fact that in the Volga economic region those reporting having a second job are also above the national average.
