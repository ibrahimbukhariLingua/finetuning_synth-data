## Description

The magic store is located at Pike Place Market in Central Waterfront, Seattle.

In 2018, John Prentice of *Seattle Refined* wrote, "Market Magic stocks a wide variety of reasonably priced miracles starting at under $10, something for every age and skill level, from complete kits for the beginner to complex illusions used by the best in the business." The shop has stocked century-old posters, juggling pins, practical joke devices, and various tricks.

Operated by spouses Sheila Lyon and Darryl Beckmann, the business has been described by Harrison Jacobs of *Business Insider* as one of the oldest operating magic shops in the United States and a "staple" of Pike Place Market.
