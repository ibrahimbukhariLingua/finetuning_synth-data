## Biography

Jean-Pierre Léon Louis Joseph Marie Berghmans, born on 23 January 1949 in Namêche (Belgium), is the son of Jean Berghmans (1918–1999) and Baroness Elisabeth Lhoist (1921–2020). In 1972 he married Countess Catherine d'Aspremont Lynden, daughter of mayor, senator and minister Count Harold Charles d'Aspremont Lynden (1914–1967), with whom he had three daughters. On his mother's side, he is a descendant of the Lhoist family dynasty, industrialists specialising in lime, dolime and mineral solutions since the late 19th century. He is notably the grandson of Léon Lhoist who expanded the industrial activities of the family in the 20th century.

He studied at university, obtaining a degree in pure economics from the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) and an MBA from INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France. In 1974, he joined the Lhoist group, a family business on his mother's side. In 1979, he became managing director and a member of the board of directors. In 1985, he became chairman of the executive committee.

Under the impetus of Jean-Pierre Berghmans, the Lhoist group extended its activities to the American continent in the 1980s, then to eastern Europe and Germany in the 1990s. In the 2000s, further acquisitions were made in southern Europe, Brazil and Asia. It employs some 6,650 people and sells its products and solutions in over 80 countries. The company operates 135 sites and terminals in over 25 countries. The Lhoist group's head office is located at Limelette (Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve) in Walloon Brabant since 1989.
