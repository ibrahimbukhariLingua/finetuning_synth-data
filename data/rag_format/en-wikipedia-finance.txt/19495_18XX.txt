18XX


# 18XX



**18XX** is the generic term for a series of board games that, with a few exceptions, recreate the building of railroad corporations during the 19th century; individual games within the series use particular years in the 19th century as their title (usually the date of the start of railway development in the area of the world they cover), or "18" plus a two or more letter geographical designator (such as *18EU* for a game set in the European Union). The games *2038*, set in the future, and *Poseidon* and *Ur, 1830 BC*, both set in ancient history, are also regarded as 18XX titles as their game mechanics and titling nomenclature are similar despite variance from the common railroad/stock-market theme.

The 18XX series has its origins in the game *1829*, first produced by Francis Tresham in the mid-1970s. 1829 was chosen as it was the year of the Rainhill Trials. *1830* was produced by Avalon Hill in 1986, and was the first game of the series widely available in the United States; it is seen as the basic 18XX game by the U.S. audience.

In addition to traditionally published games, the 18XX series has spawned self-published variants and games published by low-volume game companies.

With few exceptions (such as *2038*), 18XX titles are multiplayer board games without random variables in their game mechanics.


## Gameplay


### Common features

*18XX* games vary, but most follow this general pattern:

* The objective is to enhance personal wealth, not the assets of any companies a player may be operating. Personal wealth consists of cash, company stock (which increases wealth both by receiving dividends and by capital appreciation), and other investments (such as private companies).
* Players don't directly interact with the game board, but do so indirectly through companies they control. Generally, the player who owns the most stock of a company is the president of that company and makes all decisions on behalf of that company. The president is also often required to help fund the company when it lacks sufficient funds to satisfy a mandated expense (such as owning a train by the end of its turn).
* Game play alternates between "stock rounds" and one or more "operating rounds". In a stock round, players buy and sell stock (some games have company actions during a stock round as well), while in an operating round players take actions on behalf of companies they control, including laying track, placing station tokens, operating trains, withholding income or paying dividends, and buying trains.
* "Certificate limit": there is usually a limit to how many corporate shares and private companies a player may own, to keep the game competitive by preventing snowball effects resulting from early leads by some players.
* The "President's certificate" (or "Director's certificate") represents control of a railroad corporation, usually represents a greater percentage of corporate stock than other certificates (e.g., 20% as opposed to 10%), and is usually the first one purchased for a company (with its purchaser setting the price, or "par value", for regular shares of stock in many titles in the series). If another player accumulates more shares in a company than the current president, they acquire the President's certificate (with attendant side-effects for both players regarding certificate limits) in exchange for their own lesser shares, and becomes the new controller of the corporation.
* Certain games may impose restrictions on the order in which companies may be started (generally to impose a historical context upon the game), and they vary in how many shares must be purchased before the company may operate ("floats").
* The map is usually a hex grid that depicts cities and terrain features. Hexagonal "track" tiles (representing available land-rights) are laid on top of this map to represent the growth of railroad networks, and tokens are placed on the board to represent stations (as well as special abilities from private companies). Cities have values which can vary based on which tiles have been laid on the city, the phase of the game, their historical importance to a corporation, or type of train used to reach them. Different color tiles are available in succession, and in phases that are typically determined by the first purchase of a more advanced type of train.
* A company's stock price is adjusted based on the revenues earned and whether the president chose to pay dividends or to withhold the earnings in the company treasury. Stock prices are usually also affected by actions in the stock round, and some games have other mechanisms that affect the stock price.
* Scarcity (forcing future-turn planning by players) of available corporations, shares thereof, train types, and track tiles.
* Trains eventually become obsolete and must be replaced by more-expensive trains that also have greater capacity for earning revenue. Purchase of a new type of train usually triggers other phase-changes in the game, such as the obsolescence of older trains, the availability of different sets of tiles, increased valuation of certain non-tiled cities, closure of private companies, and the ability to merge corporations or form them at higher valuations.
* Game end is usually determined when the bank runs out of money, and also by player bankruptcy (when a player cannot pay the debt of a company they control). Some games do not end when a player goes bankrupt, while others add other conditions for ending the game such as when a stock reaches a certain value on the stock market, or the most advanced type of train has been purchased. Other games do not feature bankruptcy at all, and enable a player to place a moribund company in "receivership", or be incorporated into a government railway, and walk away from debts.

### Differences

While adhering to common similarities (see preceding section), each *18XX* game differs from the others in subtle or significant ways in rule set as well as game map. As with games in general, each individual mechanic has probably been used before, but a new game can put together a set of mechanics which provide a new and interesting challenge. Some typical areas of difference are:

* **Initial Auction** – there are many different ways to distribute initial private companies and starting major corporations.
* **Private Companies** – most *18XX* games have private companies which are entirely owned by one player, and represent the earliest companies in the game and/or provide special abilities. "Privates", as they are called, generally do little other than provide revenue, but in some games they control access to or enhance the revenue of certain hexes on the map. Some games have very similar private companies, some have very different private companies, and some dispense with having private companies at all. Some titles (e.g., *1835* and *1861*) also have **Minor Companies**, which are again owned entirely by one player but play a more dynamic role than Privates.
* **Corporation Funding** – some games have full funding for a corporation as soon as it floats, while others have the company receiving money only as each share is sold. Some games require the corporation to reach a historically relevant destination in order to receive some of its capital or earn the best level of income.
* **Company Types** – some games have multiple company types. These types may vary based on how many shares are available for purchase, the funding model for the company, the number of station tokens available, or which types of trains may be purchased by the company.
* **Corporate mergers and demergers** – some games feature optional, or forced, mergers or splits of one or more companies.
* **Corporate stock-ownership** – some games enable companies to hold their own stock, purchase private corporations, and/or own the stock of other companies (even to the point of owning or as prelude to merger).
* **Train Types** – some may offer multiple types of trains with distinct capabilities or lifetimes.
 + Some trains may "degrade" into other train types upon certain events (for example, delayed obsolescence of 4-trains in *18MEX*, or normal trains becoming H-trains in *1844*).
 + Trains may become available in unusual sequences. For example, in *1830*, diesel engines are available as soon as the first 6-train is purchased — all the 6-trains are not required to be purchased first. In *1824*, G-train availability is controlled by when normal trains are purchased.
 + Certain trains may be restricted in terms of which locations they may run to or may count revenue from, or they may provide bonuses for running to certain locations. For example, in *1844*, H-trains are prohibited from running to off-board locations. In *1854*, only Orient Express trains may run to certain off-board areas. In *1889*, diesels get special bonuses for off-board locations. In *1826*, E-trains and TGVs ignore dot-towns. TGVs in 1826 and 4D-trains in *18MEX* double the value of cities they count. In *1824*, only G-trains may run to mines and the corporation always gets the value of the mine rather than it being potentially paid to stockholders.
* **Theme** – a few titles eschew the common railroad/stock-market theme. For example, *2038* involves space exploration of the asteroid belt, while *Ur, 1830 BC* involves building dams and canals in ancient Mesopotamia (in the latter game, "corporations", "presidents" and stock "shares" are represented by kingdoms, rulers and parcels of land).

## Conventions and tournaments

A number of conventions have at least some emphasis on 18XX games, including the Chattanooga Rail Gaming Challenge, held in January or February in Chattanooga, Tennessee and run by Mark Derrick. 18XX games also figure prominently in various "RailCon" and "Puffing Billy" tournaments at many conventions.


## Play by email and Online

18xx games are often played remotely using various tools that support
play by email games.

Many games in the genre are implemented on 18xx.games , which is open-source and supports both multiplayer and local play.

Another open source project which supports a large number of 18xx titles is BOARD18.
BOARD18 was designed for use in play by email games and is not recommended for live play.


## Publishers

Following Tresham's initial design, many different designers and publishers have made games using the same basic mechanics and theming. Today, many different publishers offer 18XX games. Some of the most notable include:

* All-Aboard Games, a publisher dedicated solely to 18XX games
* GMT Games, notable for its collaborations with designer Tom Lehmann (also known for the Race for the Galaxy series)
* Golden Spike Games, which manufactures games by hand for Deep Thought Games (a now-inactive publisher of 18XX games)
* Grand Trunk Games, publishing previously self-published titles
* Lonny Games, a German publisher reprinting games and the original designs of Leonhard Orgler
* Marflow Games, a German publisher mainly publishing the designs of Wolfram Janich
* TraXX Games, offering print-and-play titles
* 18Wood, offering mainly handmade 18XX accessories

## List of 18XX titles

The 18XX series is prolific, with many different publishers offering games and many fans designing and self-publishing titles in the series as well. The website BoardGameGeek lists 293 titles (including games and expansions) in the series as of January 2025. Not all of these titles are necessarily in production: many titles are only available as print-and-play games, offering rules and digital assets but requiring fans to print and assemble the games independently.

Due to the large number of games, the disparate designers and publishers, and the question of what constitutes a complete 18XX game, it is difficult to create an exhaustive list of all 18XX titles. This list contains the most notable titles from major publishers as well as some notable self-published 18XX titles.
