## History

The bank, initially known as 北京城市合作银行, was incorporated on 29 January 1996. (or founded on 8 January 1996 according to another source; the establishment of the bank was approved by various departments in June–December 1995.) The bank was founded as a holding company for the credit unions (Chinese: 城市信用社) in the city. However, in 1997, it was discovered that one of the former credit union of the banking group in Zhongguancun, had an accounting scandal with a huge deficit. The manager of that branch was arrested in 2011 and was sentenced 14 years imprisonment in 2012; the governor of that branch was arrested in 1998 and was sentenced capital punishment in 2003.

It was known as 北京市商业银行 (literally *Beijing City Commercial Bank*) since 1998, as one of the licensee of urban commercial bank (Chinese: 城市商业银行). In 2004, China Banking Regulatory Commission approved the renaming to **Bank of Beijing** (Chinese: 北京银行). It became effective on 1 January 2005.

In 2005, the bank became a Sino-foreign joint venture, which ING Group purchased 19.9% shares of the bank. On 19 September 2007, the bank became a listed company on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The bank also purchased a Sino-foreign joint venture insurance company, which was previous known as ING Capital Life Insurance in 2010, from municipal-owned Beijing Capital Group. As of 31 December 2017ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the bank still owned 50% stake of the insurer, which now known as BOB-Cardif Life. Despite that it was now a joint venture of the bank and French multinational company Cardif, the insurer was still known as 中荷人寿 in Chinese, literally *Sino-Dutch Life Insurance*.

In December 2017, ING subscribed the capital increase of the bank, despite that the ownership ratio of the ordinary shares was still diluted from 13.6% to 13.0%. Before the capital increase, Beijing municipal government only owned 8.84% shares via Beijing State-owned Assets Management, as well as additional 5.08% via Beijing Energy Investment Holdings. However, it also caused a minor controversy in 2013, as Ren Zhiqiang (Chinese: 任志强), an independent director of the bank, accused the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of Beijing municipal government had influenced the election of the supervisory board (Chinese: 监事会) of the bank, which Qiang Xin (Chinese: 强新), the deputy of Beijing SASAC was elected as the chairwoman of the supervisory board (Chinese: 监事长), replacing Shi Yuan (Chinese: 史元). Qiang also served as the Deputy Party Committee Secretary of the bank since 2010. Qiang was succeeded by Zeng Ying (Chinese: 曾颖) in 2016; she was the deputy of Beijing Bureau of China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2011.

The bank also faced another minor scandal in February 2015, in which a director of the bank, Lu Haijun (Chinese: 陆海军) was under investigation for corruption. He was dismissed by the shareholders' meeting during 2015. Since 2008, Lu was also the chairman of Beijing Energy Investment Holdings, a shareholder of the bank. Lu was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment for his crime as the manager of Beijing Energy Investment Holdings in 2016.
