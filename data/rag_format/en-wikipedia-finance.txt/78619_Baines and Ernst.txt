The company was also approved to provide Debt Relief Orders to people living in Northern Ireland in 2011.

Baines & Ernst was the first company to be established from its parent company, the Paymex Group. Baines & Ernst associated companies include Baker Evans for Bankruptcy and Baines & Ernst Corporate for business insolvency.

## Financial Services

Baines & Ernst's main service is the Debt Management Plan – also referred to as a DMP.

A Debt Relief Order – also known as a DRO – came into force in the UK and Wales in April 2009 and in Northern Ireland in 2011 following its introduction in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 as a new form of Bankruptcy.

Debt Relief Orders are suitable for people who do not own their own home, have little surplus income and assets and less than £15,000 of debt.
Baines & Ernst was approved by the Secretary of State as a Competent Authority for the provision of Debt Relief Orders in the UK, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The company provides the DRO service for free but those applying for a DRO must pay a fee of £90 to the Insolvency Service.
