## History

MINISO was founded in 2013 by Ye Guofu, a Chinese entrepreneur based in Guangzhou and later a billionaire. MINISO opened its first pilot store in Guangzhou, China in 2013, near its factory. It then expanded to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia before opening several stores in Sydney, Australia The company was co-founded by Japanese designer Miyake Junya who met Ye Guofu in 2013 through a friend’s introduction according to himself. The company initially employed a Japanese-influenced branding strategy, despite previously operating under Chinese company Aiyaya. MINISO’s first overseas store was opened in Singapore in 2015, two years since its debut in Guangzhou. MINISO has since expanded outside of the Chinese market and operates 6,868 in Asia, Europe, Oceania, Africa, North America, and South America.

In January 2017, MINISO announced that they were seeking to enter the North Korean market, opening their first store in Pyongyang four months later. According to *The Economist*, the store was popular among the country's wealthy but only accepted foreign currency, including the U.S. Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and Euro as payment. Soon after opening, the company's Japanese branch came under pressure for violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 2321 prohibiting trade with North Korea, distanced themselves from the move, and blamed the Chinese offices for the decision. As a result of the controversy, MINISO promised not to ship any more products to North Korea and the Pyongyang store was rebranded as "Evolution".

In September 2018, MINISO received its first external strategic investment funding of one billion RMB from Tencent and Hillhouse Funding Group. On December 18, 2018, MINISO Canada filed for bankruptcy. In March 2019, MINISO China took over the operations of MINISO Canada.

In August 2022 MINISO apologized for "wrong brand positioning and marketing", admitting that the company was a "proud Chinese brand through and through", and said it would remove its Japanese inspired elements (including their katakana logo, which read in Japanese is actually "MEISOU") by March 2023.

In 2023, MINISO released new brand strategies including launching different store types such as IP-themed stores, “super stores” and national flagship stores and changed the font on the logo. Their stores have been revamped, removing most Japanese references, and are much larger in size for more products.

In May 2024, MINISO ceased to exist in the Republic of Ireland and went into administration in Australia.

## Intellectual property concerns


### Copycat controversy

Since its opening, MINISO has focused on "Japanese style." Its logo, store image, and products are similar to those of UNIQLO, MUJI, Daiso and even caused controversy over plagiarism due to being too similar. Their business methods are also known as "cottage-style" business methods.

Laura Wen-Yu Young, a managing partner at San Francisco-based law firm Wang and Wang believes that there are no restrictions on creating a brand that simply sounds Japanese or Korean. She ultimately thinks that it will be up to the customers to decide whether such businesses "will succeed or fail based on normal market principle".

Simon Collins, founder of Fashion Culture Design Unconference and former Dean of Parsons School of Design, suggests that the criticism MINISO has been facing doesn't stand to a certain extent. He does not think that "Muji or Uniqlo represent Japanese cultural brand", given that they are "100% international".

MINISO allegedly started to remove Japanese elements from its stores and shopping bags in late 2019 across its 3,100 shops in China. MINISO’s "de-Japanisation" process has allegedly been completed in March 2023.


### Copyright infringement

Several products of MINISO were also accused of infringing copyrights rather than authorizing the use of characters designed by different cartoonists and illustrators. In mainland China, MINISO and its trademark owner Saiman Investment have been involved in many intellectual property infringement lawsuits, most of which ended with MINISO compensation.

The commodity director of MINISO said that their products "are similar to other famous brands because they are the original factory of the favorite brand products, so the similar appearance is reasonable."


## Finances

According to reports, the address, chairman, founder, and investment fund of Fenlibao, a P2P online lending platform, are all the same, and there are reports that the platform was established to support MINISO. However, after the Fenlibao platform collected funds from individual investors, MINISO guaranteed it, and then loaned to MINISO’s franchisees at an annual interest rate as high as 18%, and the franchisees were asked to pay MINISO Chuangyoupin, this financing method has been questioned to transfer operating risks to franchisees to conduct "self-financing" (self-financing) behaviors that violate mainland Chinese laws and regulations, and is also suspected of violating regulations that prohibit providing "self-guarantees" to lenders. Its individual financing amount is also suspected of exceeding the upper limit. However, MINISO replied that its "industry-finance integration model" is not self-financing, and believes that doubters do not understand the operating nature of its P2P financing. At the same time, according to the official announcement, the main assets of Fenlibao, an online loan investment docking platform, come from MINISO, and investors can get an annual interest rate of 6-11%, which is relatively "stable." This financing method allows MINISO to "transfuse blood" for franchisees and circulate assets internally to realize its business empire.


## Marketing

While MINISO is a company from China, the company has stated that its products tend to reflect Japanese design which they attributed to having a lead designer from Japan. MINISO's marketing strategy has been compared to Japanese retailers such as Muji and Uniqlo due to similarities in both store aesthetics, brand design, and inventory. Because of its Japanese-influenced branding strategy, the company's products have been criticized as "made in China to look Japanese", particularly when most of the company's stores are located in China, where people trust Japanese brands more than domestic offerings. It has also been criticized for affixing grammatically incorrect Japanese-language labels to many products, a consequence of using Baidu Translate to produce Japanese language copy, as admitted by MINISO's management.

Nevertheless, because of MINISO's success in expanding its number of retail stores, AllianceBernstein, a global asset management company, called its market strategy a success by "filling a price-point niche left unaddressed by the Japanese formats it was imitating".

IP collaborations, word-of-mouth, celebrity endorsements and the ability to launch viral products are the basis of MINISO's success in China. Apart from collaborating with international brands, its store designs that attract customers and encourage social media engagement, it also uses blind boxes to increase sales, especially among young consumers.


## Social responsibility

In February 2022, MINISO entered into partnership with Peruvian NGO ECOAN to plant a tree in the Andes mountains for each certain number of items it sold. The project was joined by entities from 37 countries and donated 115,000 plants. On June 22, 2022, MINISO launched a charity campaign - Penpen2PENPEN focused on supporting children around the world. MINISO alongside its customers and fans donated goods to children in 18 different countries. In September 2022, MINISO and the China Green Foundation jointly launched the #PlantForPanda# campaign to raise awareness for panda conservation and bamboo planting. The campaign resulted in planting over 50,000 clumps of bamboo for pandas. MINISO’s 2023 ESG Report indicated that it supports women through its marriage and childbirth incentive programs and has established a fund of US$1.38 million. The proportion of women in senior management positions in China is 61.8%.
