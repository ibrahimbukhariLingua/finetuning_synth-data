# Masaaki Kijima



**Masaaki Kijima** (born 1957) is a Japanese economist and mathematician. The Dean of the School of Informatics and Data Science at Hiroshima University, he has made significant contributions to applied probability and financial engineering. The most familiar of his contributions in the field of applied probability was the development of the G-renewal process. Kijima graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1980, then obtained a Ph.D. in business from the University of Rochester in 1986.


## Work

Kijima and Sumita were the first to develop the generalized renewal process (GRP). Two years later, Kijima, Morimura, and Suzuki adapted the G-Renewal process to model the failure process of repairable systems with general repair conditions through the notion of the virtual age.
