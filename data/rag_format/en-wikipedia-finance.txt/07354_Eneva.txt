## Coal mining

Eneva has coal mining rights in Colombia and a 70% stake in the Seival coal mine in southern Brazil. Through MPX Columbia it developed Canaverales coal mine in northern Colombia. The project includes Reeds, Papayal and San Benito open pit mines and the San Juan underground mine. The mining complex was expected to become operational by 2014. However financial pressures forced Eike Batista to sell the project to Yildirim Holding AS of Turkey for some $450 million. For coal export it developed a coal terminal at a 521 hectares (1,290 acres) site on the Atlantic coast in Dibulla, La Guajira. In addition to the terminal, a 150-kilometre (93 mi) railroad was to be built from the coal mine to the terminal. MPX had announced spinoff its coal mining assets in Colombia to form a new company called Colombian Coal (CCX), listed on the São Paulo stock exchange.

Together with OGX, Eneva has a 70% stake in seven natural gas exploration blocks in Maranhão.
