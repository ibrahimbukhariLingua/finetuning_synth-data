#### Family feud

Although spun off from Samsung in 1993, CJ is still related to Samsung through family ties. The CEO of Samsung, Lee Kun-hee, is the younger brother of Lee Maeng-hee, the former president of CJ. The family came to the center of the media spotlight when Lee Maeng-hee and sister Lee Sook-hee filed civil suits against Lee Kun-hee, claiming that Lee Kun-hee had illegally acquired his inheritance by concealing parts of their father's, Lee Byeong-chul, assets. As a remedy, they asked for shares of Samsung Life Insurance, which controls Samsung Electronics.

Since then, the feud was highly publicized as the brothers were quoted in attacking each other through the media, and intensified after it was found out that a Samsung employee had tailed Lee Jay-hyun,ʷʰᵉⁿ? the chairman of CJ group.

In January 2013, the court ruled against Lee Maeng-hee on the basis that there was not enough evidence to prove that the dividends and proceeds of Samsung was part of the inheritance.


#### Conviction of chairman

Company chairman Lee Jay-hyun was arrested in 2013 and convicted in 2014 of tax evasion and embezzlement. He was released from prison in August 2016 in an annual presidential pardon.
