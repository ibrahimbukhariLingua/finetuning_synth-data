In late 2019, Kvamme joined Rick Ware Racing's Asian Le Mans Series program, where he shared the No. 52 Ligier JS P2 with Cody Ware. In their first race at Shanghai International Circuit, despite missing qualifying and only having two laps of practice, Ware and Kvamme finished second in the LMPS Am class and 14th overall.

Kvamme's team MDK Motorsports was also active in motocross during the early 2000s, and returned to the sport for the 2022 season of the reborn FIM World Supercross Championship.
