### DATRAN 1500

As reported in 2010, an indigenous engine, capable of providing a power output of 1,500 hp (1,100 kW) was to be developed for DRDO's Future Main Battle Tank (FMBT) programme. A national team had been formed including members from the academia, the user, industry and the DRDO. The first prototype would be ready by 4-5 yrs. Another project to develop the automatic transmission system for the tank was being launched. The indigenous engine along with the transmission will be collectively form the **Bharat Power Pack** which will meet the FMBT's mobility requirements.

As of 2012, DRDO had launched a “mission mode” project to develop the engine. The development project includes companies like Kirloskar Oil Engines, BEML, and the Mahindra & Mahindra; research institutions like Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs); and bodies like the Automotive Research Association of India, Pune. An Indian “prime contractor” would assemble the engines from sub-components delivered by a network of sub-contractors. As reported, the DRDO had been trying to bring in international consultants for assistance in designing the engine. By then, German companies MTU and Renk had refused to provide consultancy and, as of then, consultancy proposals from Ricardo of Britain and AVL of Austria was being evaluated. DRDO had also issued an Expression of Interest (EoI) to select an Indian partner to manufacture the engine. The selected consultant will work in a consortium including DRDO, the Army (user) and the Indian manufacturing partner. As per the 2012 timeline, the programme includes 12 months for designing, additional 18 months for prototype development – a total of 30–36 months to begin testing of the prototype.

As of February 2024, reports suggest the German-origin engine of Arjun Mk1A variant will be replaced by the DATRAN 1500 engine which is being developed by DRDO and currently under testing phase. This is because of the sudden closure of MTU Friedrichshafen's supply chain which is expected to take four years more to restart.

The DATRAN 1500 engine had its first testing in 2023. On 20 March 2024, the prototype engine was again successfully tested at BEML's Engine Division Mysuru facility. The engine has electronic control, self-cleaning air filter, CRDi fuel injection system, and electronic warning control. In addition, the engine has a high power-to-weight ratio and can run in a variety of harsh environments, such as 5,000 meters or more above sea level, in sub-zero temperature of -40 °C, and up to +55 °C in a hot desert environment. Twenty such engines, with an emphasis on technology stabilization, will be produced in 2024 and put through additional testing to evaluate their performance, robustness, and dependability. The project is expected to be completed by the middle of 2025.

A total of 20 DATRAN prototypes are to be delivered by BEML. After initial trials, the performance of the engine is to be tested onboard a modified Arjun MBT prototype which would be heavier than the in-service main battle tanks of the Army or the MBTs the engine would power (Arjun variants, FMBT and FRCV). The engine could also be integrated on T-90MkIII (advanced Indian variant) from 2027-28.

## Controversy

In 2014, BEML made headlines when former army chief VK Singh alleged he was offered a bribe of 14 crores to clear sub-standard trucks for the army. These trucks, known as Tatra trucks, are supplied to BEML via a London agent for assembly. The CBI was investigating allegations of the bribe, as well as the alleged violation of basic rules by BEML, where defense equipment must be purchased directly from the manufacturer without involving middlemen.
