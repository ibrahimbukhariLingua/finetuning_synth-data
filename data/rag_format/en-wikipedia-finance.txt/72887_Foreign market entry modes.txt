Foreign market entry modes


# Foreign market entry modes



In international trade, **foreign market entry modes** are the ways in which a company can expand its services into a non-domestic market.

There are two major types of market entry modes: equity and non-equity. The non-equity modes category includes export and contractual agreements. The equity modes category includes joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries. Different entry modes differ in three crucial aspects:

* The degree of risk they present.
* The control and commitment of resources they require.
* The return on investment they promise.

## Exporting

Exporting is the process of selling of goods and services produced in one country to other countries.

There are two types of exporting: direct and indirect.


### Direct Exports

Passive exports represent the treating and filling overseas orders like domestic orders.


#### Types


#### Advantages

* Control over a selection of foreign markets and choice of foreign representative companies
* Good information feedback from target market, developing better relationships with the buyers
* Better protection of trademarks, patents, goodwill, and other intangible property
* Potentially greater sales, and therefore greater profit, than with indirect exporting.

#### Disadvantages

* Higher start-up costs and higher risks as opposed to indirect exporting
* Requires higher investments of time, resources and personnel and also organizational changes
* Greater information requirements
* Longer time-to-market as opposed to indirect exporting.

### Indirect exports

Indirect export is the process of exporting through domestically based export intermediaries. The exporter has no control over its products in the foreign market.


#### Types


#### Advantages

* Fast market access
* Concentration of resources towards production
* Little or no financial commitment as the clients' exports usually covers most expenses associated with international sales.
* Low risk exists for companies who consider their domestic market to be more important and for companies that are still developing their R&D, marketing, and sales strategies.
* Export management is outsourced, alleviating pressure from management team
* No direct handle of export processes.

#### Disadvantages

* Little or no control over distribution, sales, marketing, etc. as opposed to direct exporting
* Wrong choice of distributor, and by effect, market, may lead to inadequate market feedback affecting the international success of the company
* Potentially lower sales as compared to direct exporting (although low volume can be a key aspect of successfully exporting directly). Export partners that incorrectly select a specific distributor/market may hinder a firm's functional ability.

Companies that seriously consider international markets as a crucial part of their success would likely consider direct exporting as the market entry tool. Indirect exporting is preferred by companies who would want to avoid financial risk as a threat to their other goals.
