NeuConnect


# NeuConnect



**NeuConnect** is a high-voltage direct current submarine power cable under construction since 2023 between the Isle of Grain, England and Wilhelmshaven Germany, expected to operate in 2028. It will be the first interconnector between the UK and Germany. The cost of £2.4 billion (€2.8 billion) is financed by Meridiam from France, Allianz Capital Partners from Germany, Kansai Electric Power Company from Japan, and Tokyo Electric Power Company from Japan. The Chair of NeuConnect is Julia Prescot CBE.


## Project status

The main construction phase started in 2023. As of June 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, operation was expected to start in 2028. On 21 May 2024, Gregory Hands and Robert Habeck made a symbolic groundbreaking in Germany. As of November 2024, subsea cabling works had started in UK waters.


## Route

The cable will run between a new substation on the Isle of Grain, in Kent in England to the Fedderwarden substation in Wilhelmshaven in the Lower Saxony region of Germany. Landfall will be next to Grain Coastal Park, in Kent, and at Hooksiel, near Wilhelmshaven in Germany.

At 725 km in length, the interconnector will be one of the longest worldwide.


## Economics

As of 2022 the project was expected to cost £2.4 billion (€2.8 billion). The project is expected to deliver £1.7 billion in consumer benefits to UK consumers over 25 years, and could deliver a net reduction in carbon emissions of over 13MtCO2 in the same time.

The project is privately financed by Meridiam from France, Allianz Capital Partners from Germany, Kansai Electric Power Company from Japan, and Tokyo Electric Power Company from Japan. It is planned to exchange electricity on days with excess production on one side and a deficit on the other side of the Channel, as both countries have been expanding their wind turbine capacities and production has become more volatile. Britain, an electricity importer, where 5.4 percent of its 2020 demand was covered from abroad, hopes that the connection will lead to lower electricity costs for consumers, where the price of electricity has been permanently higher than in Germany.


## Technical specification

The HVDC link will consist of two main cables, each approximately 720 km (450 miles) long, together with a much thinner fibre optic cable for temperature and acoustic sensing for about 150 km (93 miles) from each landfall. The DC element will operate at 525 kV, with a maximum capacity of 1,400 MW.


## History

Historically, both countries already have had interconnectors through the North Sea with other countries: NordLink between Norwegian hydropower plants and German wind power and Britain as net electricity importer has interconnectors with France, Ireland and the Netherlands. NeuConnect will become the first direct interconnector between the UK and Germany.

Neuconnect Britain Ltd. was established in 2018.
NeuConnect received Interim Project Approval from Ofgem in January 2018.
Public consultation events were held in July 2019.
In December 2019, the planning application was submitted to Medway Council
and invitations to Tender were launched
In January 2020, the Federal Network Agency in Germany (BNetzA) confirmed the NeuConnect interconnector project in its 2019-2030 grid development plan.
In April 2020, Neuconnect completed site survey work on the Isle of Grain.
A €1.2 billion cable contract was awarded in February 2022, and substations contract in April.

In July 2022, the project reached financial close, allowing early construction works to begin later in 2022.
In October 2022, the cable manufacturer Prysmian started production of the 725km cable.
As of December 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, early construction works had started in Wilhelmshaven and Isle of Grain, and manufacture of the cable had started. As of November 2024, subsea cabling works had started in UK waters.
