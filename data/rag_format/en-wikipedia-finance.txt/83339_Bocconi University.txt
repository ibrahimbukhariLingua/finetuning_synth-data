# Bocconi University



**Bocconi University** or **Università Bocconi** (formally known in Italian as *Università Commerciale Luigi Bocconi* [universiˈta kommerˈtʃaːle luˈiːdʒi bokˈkoːni] - Luigi Bocconi Commercial University) is a private university in Milan, Italy. The university is consistently ranked as the best in Italy in its fields and among the best in the world.

The university provides education in the fields of economics, finance, law, business administration, management, political science, public administration, information science, data science, and computer science. Bocconi is a founding member of CEMS - The Global Alliance in Management Education, and the university through its graduate business school, SDA Bocconi School of Management, has received triple accreditation from the AACSB, EQUIS, and the AMBA where it offers MBA, Executive MBA, DBA, professional development, executive education, and professional certification programs.


## History

Bocconi University was founded in 1902 by Ferdinando Bocconi and was named after his son, who died in the Battle of Adwa during the First Italo-Ethiopian War. The university was originally affiliated with the Polytechnic University of Milan engineering school and incorporated a teaching model that was based on what was in use at the École Supérieure of Antwerp.


## Campus

The campus was originally located in Via Statuto near the Pinacoteca di Brera, where its first building was inaugurated in 1902. The campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings within walking distance to Porta Ticinese, the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio:

* The Sarfatti Building is the oldest building on campus. It was designed in 1936 by the Italian architect Giuseppe Pagano. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a restaurant, and most of the administrative offices. Its entrance features two lion statues which are the subject of several university myths.
* The *pensionato* building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the canteen and dormitory facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric "L" letter, which stands for Laude.
* The SDA Bocconi building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and featured two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus football pitch is placed between the *pensionato* and the SDA Bocconi building.
* The modern *Velodromo* building was projected by Ignazio Gardella and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an ellipsoid velodrome. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The *Velodromo* uses a geothermal exchange heat pump as its air conditioning system, which provides energy conservation. A marble statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.
* Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the Library building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus chapel *"San Ferdinando"*, and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other extracurricular activities.
* In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielmo Roentgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice Grafton Architects which designed the innovative building. The Grafton Building won the "World building of the year" at the World Architecture Festival 2008 held in Barcelona. The new building houses the offices of the entire Faculty, with its Departments and Research Centers in Viale Bligny. Its underground levels include, in addition to the new Aula Magna, seminar rooms, a spacious foyer, an exhibition area and parking. It is situated next to the *Velodromo*. The 2020 Pritzker Architecture Prize was awarded to its designers, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara of Grafton Architects.

Several other administrative and research offices of Bocconi's institutes are scattered across the area, especially around Parco Ravizza and Viale Isonzo.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Student life


### Student publications

The university hosts student-run publications:

* **Tra i Leoni**: a campus magazine run by the eponymous society.
* **Bocconi School of Law Student-Edited Papers**: the Law School's official student publication. The journal's editorial board are selected by way of an annual write-on competition, and go on to select and provide feedback on submitted papers, as well as organizing the annual call for papers.

* **Be OBjective Magazine**: a bimonthly pdf magazine founded by students from the ACME course. The magazine focuses on art, culture, media and entertainment.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

### Superstitions

In the atrium of the oldest building of the university, there are three sets of doors. The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions on either side of them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate. This derives from the adage "Chi passa tra i Leoni non si laurea alla Bocconi."

If seen from the top, the three main buildings of Bocconi seem to spell "30L" (30 *cum laude*), the maximum achievable grade in any exam. The building in Via Roentgen is the "3", the velodrome is the "0" and the main building is a cross of two "L"s.
