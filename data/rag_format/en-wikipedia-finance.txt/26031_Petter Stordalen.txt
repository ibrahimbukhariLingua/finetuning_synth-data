Stordalen was the architect of the conversion of the market area in downtown Trondheim and the re-launch of the Liertoppen shopping centre outside Oslo.

In the span of three years, the company, Steen & Strøm Invest, became the country's largest holder of commercial real estate. The expansion lasted until 1996, when Stordalen had a falling out with the largest shareholder, Stein Erik Hagen, and was asked to leave his position as CEO.


### Hotels

Stordalen bought Swedish hotel chain Home as well as Norwegian hotel company InterNor and took Choice Hotels Scandinavia public. During a three-year period, Choice Hotels Scandinavia bought, on average, a new hotel every other week and added 50 people to the payroll every 10 days.

In December 1997, Sveaas sold his 37 percent share of the now 77 hotels. In 1999, Christian Ringnes and his company Eiendomsspar acquired a 35 percent share in Choice Hotels Scandinavia. Ringnes folded. The same year, Stordalen also acquired the Danish hotel company Nordisk Hotel Group, Stenungsbaden Yacht Club, and Stockholm Globe Hotel. At age 37, Stordalen became a billionaire (in Norwegian krone).

At the opening, 10,000 people were gathered to watch a light-and-fireworks display that included Stordalen ascending from the top of the hotel playing the drums inside a 6-by-6-metre (20 ft × 20 ft) disco ball. In 2022, Stordalen opened the 231-room, art-deco Somerro Hotel in Oslo, built from the 1930s office that previously belonged to Oslo Lysverker. The hotel featured a rooftop pool and terrace and is situated in Frogner.

In 2006, Capona changed its name to Home Properties. In 2005, Home Invest bought the remaining shares in Choice Hotels Scandinavia and delisted the company.

In 2006, Home Properties spun off Home Capital as an investment company and listed it on the First North Stock Exchange in Stockholm. In 2007, Stordalen's Home Invest acquired all the shares in Home Capital and delisted the company. In 2009, Stordalen did the same with Home Properties.

### Art collection

As his fortune grew, Stordalen started investing in art, mostly contemporary. His first purchase was a painting by the American artist Ross Bleckner. Stordalen had spent five million dollars on contemporary art on his two latest hotels alone, Clarion Hotel Post in Gothenburg and Clarion Hotel & Congress in Trondheim, and has a private collection that is valued at around 30 million dollars.

In January 2013, Stordalen opened a new hotel called The Thief in the Tjuvholmen neighborhood in Oslo. Every one of the 119 rooms has unique original art. In one of the elevators there is an animation by Julian Opie, one of Stordalen's favorite artists. The Thief has signed a sponsorship deal with the neighboring Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art. Under the agreement, The Thief can borrow some signal work. Stordalen also owns some of Andy Warhol's interpretations of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch. The value of his total collections (private and business combined) has been evaluated to be valued at more than 50 million dollars.


## Business philosophy

The foundation for his business philosophy, coined *The strawberry philosophy*, stems from his memory of selling strawberries for his dad during his childhood summers. When complaining to his dad about the quality of the berries, his dad retorted, "Sell the berries you have, they are the only berries you can sell".

Stordalen hosts an annual winter conference for Nordic Choice managers that is usually held in Sweden. In addition to a big party that has previously included live camels and specially composed music and stage acts, Stordalen gives his employees a motivational speech that, in the media, has been likened to a religious revival.

In 2002, he broke into Sellafield, a British nuclear treatment plant, and chained himself to the bridge of the plant for nine hours to protest the discharging of the radioactive element technetium-99 into the sea. In 2007, he was charged with trespassing after entering a restricted area in Malmøyakalven to protest the dumping of toxic mud in the Oslofjord.

Together with his wife, Gunhild Stordalen, he founded the Stordalen Foundation. At the annual environmental organization Zero-conference in 2011, the couple secured their personal acquaintance Arnold Schwarzenegger as keynote speaker. The foundation also supports the European Climate Foundation (ECF); his wife Gunhild Anker Stordalen serves on the organization's supervisory committee. In January 2012, the couple participated in Al Gore's Climate Reality Project's expedition to the Antarctic

In June 2011, the couple founded GreeNudge. The foundation was to give decision-makers information for informing them to create climate policies.
