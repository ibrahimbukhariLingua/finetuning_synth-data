## Business career


### Early career

Together with his two friends, Sandiaga Uno and Elvin Ramli, Rosan started his business as financial advisors. The business that was started in 1996 was officially established into a company in 1997 under the name PT Republik Indonesia Funding, which is better known as Finance Indonesia. The entrepreneurial segment, which was scorned by a number of people, finally yielded sweet results. The economic crisis that has hit Indonesia since the end of '97 requires national companies to look for people who are able to revive the companies and businesses they manage. The crisis turned into a blessing for Rosan. Starting from a small office with an area of 70 square meters in Setiabudi area, Kuningan, South Jakarta, Finance Indonesia began to take the attention of large capital owners.


### Finance

In 2002, Indonesia Finance changed its name to Recapital. From a small financial advisory firm, Recapital has become a large, reputable and competent company in terms of strategic cooperation, financial asset management and investors. "One time we were chatting, we could bring in investors to help unhealthy companies. Why don't we bring in investors for our company too?" said Rosan. This idea sparked the idea to expand the line of business. With finance and banking as the leading sectors, Recapital's business is growing by entering other sectors in the industrial sector where mining, infrastructure, property, to media and communications are included. In the financial sector, Recapital is present through Recapital Securities, Recapital Asset Management, Global Sarana Lintas Artha, Recapital Life Insurance (Relife), Recapital General Insurance (Reguard), and Bank Pundi.
