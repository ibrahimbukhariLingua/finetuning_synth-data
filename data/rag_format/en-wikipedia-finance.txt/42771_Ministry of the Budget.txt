# Ministry of the Budget



The **Ministry of the Budget** (Swedish: *Budgetdepartementet*, B) was a ministry in Sweden established in 1976. The ministry was primarily responsible for budget regulation as well as the general administration and accounting of state funds, the state and municipal tax system. The ministry was headed by the minister for the budget. The ministry ceased to exist in 1982.


## History

The ministry was established after the 1976 Swedish general election when the Ministry of Finance was divided into the Ministry of the Budget and the Ministry of Economics. The division officially took place on 25 November 1976 following a government decision on 11 November. Most of the old Ministry of Finance's approximately 9,000 cases a year were taken care of by the Ministry of the Budget, e.g. the taxes, the budget and salary issues. The Ministry of Economics would primarily work with general guidelines for economic policy and the principled direction of fiscal and credit policy measures.

The ministry was primarily responsible for budget regulation as well as the general administration and accounting of state funds, the state and municipal tax system. State land and buildings, alcoholic beverages, resident registration, press support and information, personnel administrative planning, personnel health care, etc. within the state's area of responsibility, administrative democracy, etc. and training of government employees. The ministry's internal organization initially consisted of a Budget Department (BA) which would be responsible for the state budget and related issues. Furthermore, there were a number of so-called *sakområden* ("subject areas") for various issues and a secretariat for statistical data. In 1978, a secretariat for personnel policy matters (PP) was added to the Government Offices (*Regeringskansliet*). A part of this secretariat that dealt with negotiation issues regarding the personnel in the Government Offices was transferred in 1979 to the newly established body Government Office's Negotiation Delegation (*Regeringskansliets förhandlingsdelegation*), from 1982 the Government Office's Personnel Policy Delegation (*Regeringskansliets personalpolitiska delegation*, RPD). The PP Secretariat was merged in 1983 with the ministry's Organization Department where the RPD was also brought and then formed the independent Administrative Office of the Government Offices (*Regeringskansliets förvaltningskontor*). In 1978–79, certain internal reorganizations were made and from 1980 the ministry had the organization that would exist as long as the Ministry of the Budget remained.

The ministry was headed by the minister for the budget. In addition, there was two state secretaries, two directors general for administrative affairs (*expeditionschef*), two directors general for legal affairs (*rättchef*), a head of budget and other officials in different fields.

The ministry was abolished after the 1982 Swedish general election and the Ministry of Finance was re-established by Palme's Second Cabinet on 1 January 1983.
