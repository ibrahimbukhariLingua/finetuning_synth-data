List of animation studios owned by the Walt Disney Company


# List of animation studios owned by the Walt Disney Company



The Walt Disney Company has owned and operated several animation studios since the company's founding on October 16, 1923, by Walt and Roy Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio; the current Walt Disney Animation Studios in Burbank, California is the company's flagship feature animation studio and claims heritage from this original studio. Adding to the growth of the company and its motion picture studio division the Walt Disney Studios, several other animation studios were added through acquisitions and through openings of satellite studios outside the United States. These expanded the company's animation output into television, direct-to-video, and digital releases, in addition to its primary feature animation releases.

Currently Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Lucasfilm Animation (through Lucasfilm) and 20th Century Studios's animation division are parts of the Walt Disney Studios unit. This article does not include other animation studios whose films were released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (the company's distribution unit) and not acquired by the company, nor does it count the Laugh-O-Gram Studio (1921–23), Disney's first animation studio, which predated the founding of the Walt Disney Company. For example, certain Studio Ghibli films were distributed by Disney internationally but never owned by the company. Also, Miramax, an independently operating unit of the Walt Disney Studios, also purchased US rights to foreign animated movies.

## Walt Disney Studios


### Walt Disney Animation Studios


#### Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida


#### DisneyToon Studios

**DisneyToon Studios**, formerly **Disney Movietoons**, was an American animation studio owned by the Walt Disney Company, responsible for producing direct-to-video and occasional theatrical films for Disney Animation Studios, a part of the Walt Disney Studios.


#### Disney Circle 7 Animation

**Circle 7 Animation**, or Disney Circle 7 Animation, was a short-lived division of Walt Disney Feature Animation specializing in CGI animation and was originally going to work on making sequels to the Disney-owned Pixar properties, leading rivals and animators to derisively nickname the division "Pixaren't". The company released no movies during its tenure.

Steve Jobs, Pixar CEO, announced in January 2004 that Pixar would not renew their agreement with Disney and would seek out other distributors for releases starting in 2006. In 2004, Disney Circle 7 Animation was formed as a CG animation studio to create sequels to the Disney-owned Pixar properties. In late January 2006, new Disney CEO Bob Iger and Jobs agreed to have Disney purchase Pixar which led to Disney closing Circle 7.


#### The Secret Lab

**The Secret Lab** was an American special effects company that operated from 1979 to 2005, and was the result of a merger between **Dream Quest Images** and Walt Disney Feature Animation's Computer Graphics division.

Dream Quest was founded in a Santa Monica, California garage in 1979 by Hoyt Yeatman, Scott Squires, Rocco Gioffre, Fred Iguchi, Tom Hollister and Bob Hollister. Initially, they did piecemeal work on *Escape from New York,* *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,* and *One From the Heart* before moving to Culver City. DQ Films, the company's television commercial production division, remained in Santa Monica. In 1987, DQI model-making operations moved into a Simi Valley industrial park with most of the company following them later on. Their work on *The Abyss* and *Total Recall* each earned the company an Academy Award

The Walt Disney Company purchased the company in April 1996 and subsequently moved it to Burbank, California. DQI was purchased to replace Buena Vista Visual Effects. Soon after 1997, Andrew Millstein was appointed general manager of the company.

In October 1999, Dream Quest Images merged with Walt Disney Feature Animation's computer graphics division to form The Secret Lab, with Millstein continuing as general manager and vice president. The DQI and WDFA units were moved into a new location at Disney's Northside facility on Thornton Avenue just east of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, Lockheed Corp.'s former Skunk Works Building 90 until it was renovated for WDFA's headquarters in 1995. DQI's physical production facilities remained in Simi Valley.

The Secret Lab produced one CG animated motion picture, *Dinosaur,* in 2000. After *Dinosaur,* the Lab and WDFA began working on *Wildlife,* which was canceled that September.

The Lab being passed over for Disney work (and general industry decline) led to the unit being closed in 2005. The Secret Lab's last work with Disney was for the Touchstone Pictures/Spyglass Entertainment film *Reign of Fire* and the Castle Rock Entertainment/Warner Bros. comedy *Kangaroo Jack.* An artist at The Secret Lab purportedly confided to Harry Knowles of *Ain't It Cool News* that the studio was shut down by Disney when it proved to be too expensive.

**Pixar** (/ˈpɪksɑːr/) is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. The studio is best known for its CGI-animated feature films created with PhotoRealistic RenderMan, its own implementation of the industry-standard RenderMan image-rendering application programming interface used to generate high-quality images. Pixar began in 1979 as the Graphics Group, part of the computer division of Lucasfilm before its spin-out as a corporation in 1986 with funding by Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority shareholder.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Pixar and Disney had a seven feature agreement that allowed Disney to distribute the films with Disney owing the character rights. With the success of *Toy Story 2* in 1999, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs began to disagree on how Pixar should be run and the terms of their continued relationship. Eisner claimed that Toy Story 2 would not count towards the "original" film count of the agreement. Jobs announced in January 2004 that Pixar would not renew their agreement with Disney and would seek out other distributors for releases starting in 2006. In 2004, Disney Circle 7 Animation was formed as a CG animation studio to create sequels to the Disney-owned Pixar properties. In late January 2006, new Disney CEO Bob Iger and Jobs agreed to have Disney purchase Pixar which led to Disney closing Circle 7.

## Overseas studios

Three overseas animation studios (Australia, Japan and Canada) were set up to produce the company's animated television series. As direct-to-video increased in importance, the overseas studios moved to making feature films.


### Disney Animation Australia

**Disney Animation Australia** (DAA), also **DisneyToon Studios Australia**, was a Disney animation studio located in Sydney.

DAA was started in 1988 at the former Hanna-Barbera overseas studio in St Leonards, Sydney. Initially, Animation Australia worked on various television shows including *Aladdin*, *Timon & Pumbaa*, and *Goof Troop*. As staffing increased, the studio moved to Castlereagh Street.

Disney began producing direct-to-video sequels of its Feature Animation productions, the first of which was the *Aladdin* sequel *The Return of Jafar*. When *Aladdin* was selected as a possible candidate as an animated TV series (before the film's release), as with many animated series, the first three episodes were one multi-part story which Disney used as a potential 'family movie special' for the Friday night before the series' premiere. With work handed out to the Australia animation studio, the opening story was instead greenlit for a direct-to-video release. Thus with "Jafar" and its success, the direct-to-video unit, Disney Video Premieres, started. A second sequel, *Aladdin and the King of Thieves*, provided work to both the Sydney and Japanese animation units.

Australia was assigned additional film sequels: *The Lion King II: Simba's Pride*, *An Extremely Goofy Movie* and *Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure*. The company's first feature film was *Return to Never Land* in 2002 grossing over $100 million worldwide at the box office. In 2005, the studio produced three animated movies: *Tarzan II*, *Lilo & Stitch 2* and *Bambi II*. Disney Animation Australia was closed in mid-2006 after finishing *Brother Bear 2*, *The Fox and the Hound 2*, *Cinderella III*, and *The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning*.

DAJ worked on *The Tigger Movie* (2000). In 2003, the company produced *Piglet's Big Movie* for DisneyToon Studios and *101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure*. In September 2003, Disney announced the closure of the studio, with *Pooh's Heffalump Movie* (2005) to be its final work.

DAJ was closed in June 2004 with 30 employees expected to be transferred to one of the two Disney's remaining animation units. With the closure of the Japanese studio, its remaining work for DisneyToon Studios was split between its US and Australia animation units. Employees not transferred decided to launch a new company, The Answer Studio [ja].
