It occupies the most important streetscape location in the town opposite the end of Otho Street, and contributes significantly to the surviving nineteenth century character of the town centre.

It is an outstanding intact Victorian Italianate style bank building and one of the finest and most sophisticated buildings in the Shire. Its presence is enhanced by the raised ground floor level.
