# Bitium



**Bitium** was a developer of the cloud service Bitium, which provided single sign-on and identity management for software as a service (SaaS) cloud-based applications before its merger into Google Cloud. Bitium allowed end users to access all of their cloud software accounts using a single set of login credentials. The product could integrate with cloud apps using SAML for enhanced security.

Bitium also allowed companies to extend their existing directory structured to cloud apps. Bitium could integrate with Active Directory, LDAP, HRIS, Google Apps and other on-premises directories to allow for centralized user access and control.

Bitium was founded by Erik Gustavson and Scott Kriz.

Bitium was backed by venture capital firm Polaris Partners and was an early graduate of the Amplify.LA accelerator. The corporate office was located in a building which was the former studio of artist Richard Diebenkorn. Bitium had been featured at CIO.com.
