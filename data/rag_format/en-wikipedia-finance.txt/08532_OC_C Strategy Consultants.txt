OC&C Strategy Consultants


# OC&C Strategy Consultants



**OC&C Strategy Consultants LLP** (OC&C) is a British strategy-focused management consulting firm headquartered in London. The firm's core expertise is in the retail industry.


## Background

OC&C was set up in London in 1987 by Chris Outram, Geoff Cullinan and Michael Jary who were previously Booz Allen Hamilton consultants that specialized in consumer goods. They were tired of the fact their previous employers had spent so much time on operational issues instead of strategic ones and though it would be more fun and challenging to start their own firm. The firm's first client was Schweppes Cola.

Although OC&C was focused on Europe, it has expanded into other markets. In June 2007, OC&C acquired Boston-based consulting firm Callidon Group to expand its presence in the US market. Callidon focused on media and publishing. In April 2012, OC&C expanded towards the east by partnering with Valuecom Partners in Warsaw. In 2013, OC&C announced its strategic partnership with Advisia in Brazil.

OC&C initially grew as a loose federation of franchises which allowed it to expand internationally at a low cost. However this model soon faced problems as it affected decision-making since each office tended to focus only on its own local territory rather seeing things globally. In 2014, OC&C shifted to an integrated partnership model similar to its peers.

In the period between 2014 and 2015, Oliver Wyman acquired OC&C's businesses in Boston and China. This was a blow to OC&C which was seen as becoming an increasingly less global franchise.

In the period between 2016 and 2018, EY-Parthenon acquired the Benelux, French and German practices of OC&C which dealt a further blow to OC&C. However OC&C gradually rebuilt its teams in the three countries while making sure they were aligned with the firm's integrated partnership model. The French office which was closed briefly relaunched in 2017 under a more global approach and aimed to regain its presence in France.

In July 2019, OC&C acquired Italian consulting firm Long Term partners. The acquisition would allow OC&C to leverage Long Term partners' luxury sector expertise as well as well improve its position in Italy.

From 2021 onwards, news surfaced that many former OC&C partners who went to EY-Parthenon wanted to return to their original firm. In 2021 it was noted that five partners and 40 consultants in the Netherlands returned to OC&C with similar activity occurring in France but on a smaller scale. In October 2024, seven partners with over 30 consultants and staff members returned to OC&C in Germany.

In March 2022, OC&C acquired Australian Strategy Partners to obtain a presence in Australia. The firm had a strong track record of performing due diligence for private equity clients.

In December 2023, OC&C was certified as a B Corporation.


## Business operations

OC&C's core expertise is in the retail industry which it has built on by expanding into fast-moving consumer goods. In addition, the firm also covers technology, media and telecoms, business services and manufacturing. OC&C also provides services for private equity clients such as investment scoping and due diligence.

OC&C focuses on strategy rather than implementation.

OC&C also produces research reports on sectors. In 2008, it produced *State of Retail 2008* which was the first sector-wide study of its kind into the profitability and dynamics of the retail industry.
