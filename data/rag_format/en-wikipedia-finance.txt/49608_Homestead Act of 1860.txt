Homestead Act of 1860


# Homestead Act of 1860



The **Homestead Act of 1860** in the United States would have made land available for 25 cents per acre. This act was passed by the United States Congress, but was ultimately vetoed by President James Buchanan.


## Proponents

This was at a time where Northerners believed that the federal government should give 160-acre (0.65 km²; 0.25 sq mi) plots of vacant Western land to pioneers for free. People went to the West to start new lives and wanted cheap land.


## Opposition

There was much concern about the free land idea. Southerners, who were very pro-slavery, worried that this would result in the West becoming populated with free-soilers. This in turn would create many new anti-slavery states, creating an imbalance in the Senate, destroying the South's control. This was the main reason for Buchanan's veto; he consistently did what the South wanted. Another group who opposed this idea was the Eastern industrialists. They feared employees would be drained into the West for free land.
