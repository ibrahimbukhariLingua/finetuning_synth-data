## Premise

On the program, contestants answered questions about current events. The player would be asked five questions based on three newspapers which he or she studied before the show. Each correct answer earned $300. Three correct answers allowed the player to play the "investment segment" in which he or she wagered any amount of the money won on answering a question. A correct answer won the wager and a prize, plus the option to risk any prizes won and return the next week to play another "investment segment" or keep any prizes won and leave the show. A fourth win would earn that player his or her "dream prize", such as a miniature golf course or a restaurant. A fifth successful "investment segment" won that player an additional $75,000.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Contestants on *High Finance* included boxer Joe Louis and his wife, who sought to win money to pay part of the more than $1 million that Louis owed the Internal Revenue Service in back taxes. They won $41,000 as they appeared as special guests for eight weeks.


## Production

Robert Jennings and James created *High Finance*. Peter Arnell was the producer; Lou Sposa was the associate producer and director. The program originated live from WCBS-TV, replacing *Damon Runyon Theater*. Monsanto and Mennen were the sponsors. Mennen sponsored two episodes per month, and Monsanto had one. During each fourth week *Ford Star Jubilee* pre-empted *High Finance*. Mennen's sponsorship ended when the show completed its second cycle. The trade publication *Billboard* said that Mennen was "reportedly unhappy" with the program's summer ratings, which included 11.1 for August. Ratings remained a problem in the fall, diminishing as time went on, when "They should have gone higher to keep even with the sharp general viewing upswing from September to November. At the beginning of the Fall 1957 season, CBS relinquished the 10:30 p.m. Saturday time slot to affiliates.
