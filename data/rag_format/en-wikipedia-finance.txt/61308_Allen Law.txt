**Allen Law** (Chinese: 羅正雄; born 1980) is a Hong Kong-born business magnate and founder of Park Hotel Group.


## Background and family

Allen Law was born in Hong Kong to a working-class family, which found success years later. Law's father, Law Kar Po (born 1948), first started off as a small-time clothing merchant with his father, before switching to real estate. Law is the second child in the family. He has two sisters, a businesswoman in the fashion industry and a homemaker. His grandfather is Law Ting Pong, the founder of Bossini.


## Early life and career

At the age of 24, Law completed his bachelor's degree in mathematics and management at King's College London. Initially planning to continue his endeavors abroad, he received an enticing proposition from his father, Law Kar Po, urging him to return to Hong Kong immediately and take charge of the recently acquired hotel. In 2003, amid the SARs crisis, Law embraced the challenge, flying back to Hong Kong to oversee the Park Hotel brand, which included a 16-story hotel acquired at the bargain price of $67 million.

During the following months, Allen Law underwent an intensive crash course in hotel management, working two shifts at Park Hotel Hong Kong in Tsim Sha Tsui. Progressing from the role of a bellhop, he swiftly ascended to become the general manager within 18 months. Despite the initial challenges, Law recalls, "In the beginning, you feel thrown into the deep end of the ocean, but you learn how to swim."

At the age of 25, Law clinched the $300 million purchase of Crown Prince Hotel in Orchard Road, Singapore, where he headed the operations and had to simultaneously serve as the stand-in human resource manager, housekeeping manager, front-office manager, and general manager.

Allen is currently the founder of Park Hotel Group, headquartered in Singapore. He has led Park Hotel Group to grow from a single hotel in Hong Kong to a multinational company with multi-property portfolio across key destinations in countries including Singapore, China, Japan, and the Maldives. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
