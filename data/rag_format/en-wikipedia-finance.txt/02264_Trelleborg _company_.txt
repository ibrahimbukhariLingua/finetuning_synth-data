**Trelleborg AB** is a multi-national engineering company specializing in polymer technology, headquartered in Trelleborg, Sweden.

The company, which became public in 1964, currently trades on Nasdaq Stockholm.


## History

The company was founded in 1905 as "Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB" (the Rubber Factory Corporation of Trelleborg) by Henry Dunker and Johan Kock, who were both already active in the rubber industry. Initially, the company had 150 employees and produced bicycle tires and rubber for industrial applications. During World War I, the Swedish Armed Forces placed substantial orders.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

By the mid-1930s, the number of employees had reached 1,000. Beginning in the 1950s, the share of revenue from sales outside of Sweden increased; in 1950, it was 4%, and in 1970, it was 40%. In 1964, Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB was floated at the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Its current name was adopted in 1977.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Between 1983 and 1991, the strategy was to act as a wide-ranging industrial conglomerate, with a particular focus on mining and metals. Later, the company's focus shifted back to rubber products. In 1999, the scope was further narrowed by specializing in industrial applications. In 2003, polymer-based precision seals were added to the product offerings.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2009, the European Commission fined several marine hose producers, among them Trelleborg AB, "...for participating in a cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and 2007 in violation of the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices in the EC Treaty (Article 81) and the EEA Agreement (Article 53)."

In mid-2012, Trelleborg and Freudenberg formed a 50–50 joint venture in anti-vibration applications for light and heavy vehicles, TrelleborgVibracoustic. Trelleborg divested its shares in this venture to Freudenberg in 2016.

In 2022, Trelleborg acquired the Lindau-based aerospace interiors company, MG Silikon GmbH, an entity within Saint-Gobain Group, and the US-based company Minnesota Rubber & Plastics from private equity firm KKR for US$950 million.


## Criticism

Trelleborg Group faced criticism for its activities in Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The company initially pledged to suspend deliveries and sales to Russia. However, reports indicated that sales continued until February 2023, contradicting their earlier commitment.


## Operations

Trelleborg AB is divided into the following business areas:

* **Trelleborg Industrial Solutions** (hose systems, industrial anti-vibration solutions and selected industrial sealing systems)
* **Trelleborg Sealing Solutions** (precision seals for industry, aviation and vehicles) – Founded in 1952, Trelleborg Sealing Solutions was previously a part of the Smiths Group's precision seals business. This business, Polymer Sealing Solutions, consisted of four rubber units. These were Busak+Shamban, Dowty Automotive, Shamban and Forsheda. In 2003, Polymer Sealing Solutions was acquired by Trelleborg AB. The name Busak+Shamban remained with all marketing locations, but the manufacturing locations became known as Trelleborg Sealing Solutions. As of April 2, 2007, the Busak+Shamban name was retired, with all locations being brought under the Trelleborg Sealing Solutions umbrella.
* **Trelleborg Medical Solutions** – A global supplier of polymer-based integrated solutions for medical devices and biopharma
