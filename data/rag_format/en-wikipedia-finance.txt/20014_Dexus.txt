## History

Dexus was listed by Deutsche Bank on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1984 as the Deutsche Diversified Trust, followed by the Deutsche Industrial Trust in 1984 and the Deutsche Office Trust in 1998.

In 2004, all three were stapled to form the DB Rreef Trust. In 2008 it was rebranded as the Dexus Property Group after purchasing Deutsche Bank's remaining 50% shareholding. On 27 March 2017, the company was rebranded to Dexus.

In April 2022, Dexus purchased AMP Capital's real estate and domestic infrastructure equity business.
