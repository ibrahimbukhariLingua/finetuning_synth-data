## #ULSB16 controversy

In January 2021, sixteen academics were targeted for redundancy by the University of Leicester School of Business because they had published articles in *Critical Perspectives on Accounting*. Publishing in this journal was treated as evidence of unsuitable scholarship, hence a basis for redundancy. The University of Leicester aimed to shed critical management scholarship as part of a strategic reorientation of the School towards a more mainstream outlook. The sixteen faculty members were being targeted because of their engagement in critical scholarship areas deemed not sufficiently congenial with the new vision of the School. The Head of the College of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities (a sociologist) stated that management research should not be informed by a sociological perspective.
