# 2013–14 Pakistan federal budget



The **Federal Budget 2013–14** was the federal budget of Pakistan for the fiscal year beginning from 1 July 2013 and ending on 30 June 2014. The budget was presented by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on 12 June 2013 during a session of the National Assembly. This is the first federal budget presented during the tenure of newly elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his cabinet since the change of government following the nationwide general elections held in 2013.

The new budget has an outlay of ₨. 3.51 trillion and is designed to achieve a 4.4% growth rate in the economy over the next fiscal year. The budget seeks to address the country's energy crisis, reduce non-development expenditures and bring about a range of new economic policies of the elected government. The government has termed the budget as "an investment and business friendly budget."

Although no new property taxes were levied in Federal Budget but the provincial Punjab Budget 2013–14 imposed new taxes on property. Property sellers were made liable to pay a fixed percentage of tax which decreases as the retention period increases. Despite imposition of the heavy taxation, country's leading economists and financial experts believe it won't hamper the growth of the booming property market of Pakistan. The budget also allocates ₨. 57.4 billion for development of various areas in higher education— highest in the history of Pakistan.

## Opinions


### Commercial and public opinion

Responding to the budget, dr. Farrukh Saleem hailed the budget and termed it "Historic budget", as large portion of the budget was related towards the development of country's civil sector, higher education, highway infrastructure, and electricity sector. Spending on governmental infrastructure was drastically reduced to 45.5% and the Prime Minister's Secretariat had voluntarily given up its ₨. 42 billion discretionary fund. According to Farrukh Salim, the budget had shown as sign of "political maturity" as in the past governments had always abandoned schemes—whether good or bad—of their predecessors.

The budget was aimed to fill the ₨. 500 billion circular debt in state-owned enterprises for the first time since the nationalization programme began back in the January 1972. The budget deficit was to be scaled down from ₨. 2.2tn to ₨. 1.6tn with increasing the investment-to-GDP ratio to 20.9% as well as increasing international reserves by 100% and keeping inflation in 6.3%.

The main focus of the budget was to increase the spending on higher education, with the allocation of ₨. 57.1 billion and a 50.0% jump in the number of scholarships. As dr. Farrukh Saleem maintained: "Our minister of finance may not make favourable headlines, but he has made history. The document that he has presented makes him a dreamer and an artist —two in one. Someone intelligent once said, "An artist is a dreamer consenting to dream of the actual world."


### Criticism

The budget was criticized over the increase in the GST and the zero-increment on salaries of government personnel. The pro-leftist MQM rejected the budget for the new 2013–14, terming it "a burden on the masses." Addressing a press conference at Nine Zero Secretariat, MQM's convener dr. Farooq Sattar said that the increase of General sales tax (GST) is a "merciless step" for the low-income class people. Dr. Sattar said that no measures were taken to provide relief to the poor masses. He further said that the first priority of the government should be to eliminate electricity loadshedding in the country, but, he added that no steps were taken in this regard. The MQM leader said the PML-N government also failed to introduce any policy to bring back looted money. While criticizing the government, Sattar said that money should be allocated in the budget to counterterrorism efforts."

Schools teachers and educators on the other hand, describe the budget as the "Budget worst in history of Pakistan". The Punjab based SST Teachers Association lashed out at the government for providing no incentives to government employees, including teachers, in the budget. The SST Teachers Association criticised the government for not making increase in salaries of government employees. According to SST Teachers Association, it was for the first time in the country's history that government employees have been totally neglected. The Sindh based APTA association appealed to the PML(N) to reconsider the budget policy to fixing the minimum salary of workers at ₨. 18,000. The salaries of government employees should be increased in accordance with the prevailing price hike, he demanded. The Sindh-based APTA association quoted that the "APTA association, together with the Punjab Teachers Association, would launch a protest movement against the government."


### Adjustments

After the severe criticism from the public, the adjustments were carried out Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and raised salaries of government personnel by 10.2% following recommendations of the committee tasked to review its feasibility. To review the budget, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had constituted a review committee to review the possibility of an increase in the salaries of government employees.
