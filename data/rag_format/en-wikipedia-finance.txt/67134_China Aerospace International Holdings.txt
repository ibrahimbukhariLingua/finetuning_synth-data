After the completion of the capital increase, China Resources and Bank of China Group (at that time as unincorporated group of companies) became the controlling shareholder in 1984 for 35% ordinary shares via Sin King.¹³⁹ Conic at that time declared that the company did not faced any difficulties, thus the takeover was not related to the situation of the company.
