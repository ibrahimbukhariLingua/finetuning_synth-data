# Hassan Khosrowshahi



**Hassan Khosrowshahi** CM OBC (Persian: حسن خسروشاهی; born 1940) is an Iranian and Canadian business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He founded Future Shop, a Canadian consumer electronics chain store that was acquired by Best Buy in 2001 for c. $580 million. He currently invests via his family office, Persis Holdings Ltd.

Khosrowshahi had an estimated net worth of $1.16 billion in 2016.


## Early life

Hassan Khosrowshahi was born into a wealthy family in Tehran in 1940. His father, Ali Khosrowshahi, founded the Minoo Industrial Group, a conglomerate specializing in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food distribution under both its own brands and under license for major international brands.

He was educated in Iran and England and obtained his degree in law and economics from the University of Tehran. In 1961, at the age of 21, he joined the family business. In 1979, during the Iranian Revolution, Minoo Industrial Group was nationalised and the family was targeted for its wealth. The family left the country and settled in Vancouver in 1981.


## Career

In 1982, in Vancouver, Khosrowshahi founded Inwest and its subsidiary, Future Shop. By 1996, the company was the largest computer and electronics retailer in Canada. It tried to expand into the United States but was unsuccessful and suffered significant losses. In 2001, the company was acquired by Best Buy for C$580 million. In 2015, Best Buy shut down Future Shop.

The amount of this deal was 580 million Canadian dollars. This sale to Best Buy was not only a successful end for the Future Shop business as an independent brand, but also provided a new opportunity for Hassan Khosrowshahi to move towards new economic activities.

After the sale of Future Shop, Khosrowshahi focused on real estate development, pharmaceuticals, investments, and philanthropy through his family office, Persis Holdings Ltd.

Khosrowshahi has served as a director of the Bank of Canada, Canada Post, been an executive committee member of the Business Council of B.C., and has served as chairman and is a director of the Fraser Institute.
