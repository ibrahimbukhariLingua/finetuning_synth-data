## History

Masterworks was founded in 2017 by Scott Lynn to make the art market more accessible to investors. However, the company has since strayed from this business model and has begun to prioritize wealthy clients.

In 2021, Masterworks raised $110 million in Series A funding, led by Left Lane Capital. The backing valued the company at more than $1 billion. By February 2022, the company had bought more than 100 paintings, worth nearly $450 million

In June 2023, it was reported that only 5% of the sites registered users had actually made an investment. The company is also known for its large marketing push, as the company nearly doubled its marketing from $5 million to $9 million. Several employees have also reported "unethical" tactics to get better Ad placements on websites.

Scott Lynn was quoted as saying, "They know who Basquiat is, or Kaws...They don’t know the other artists. Out of 150,000 investors, very few are art world people."
