## Influenza

In April 2015, as head of the IMSS, he had to face the outbreak of influenza, the H1N1 virus that for several days paralyzed the country's economy. Together with President Calderón and the head of the Ministry of Health, he took measures to prevent the spread of this virus, such as the cancellation of classes, mass events and the closure of restaurants.

All this experience allowed him to participate in May 2015 as coauthor of the book The Mexican influenza and the pandemic that is coming next to José Luis Romo, Juan Lozano, Mauricio Ortiz, Roberto Albiztegui and Santiago Echevarría Zuno, published by Siglo XXI, in which he describes his experience at the head of the IMSS during the emergence of the virus, the management of the information, the coordination of health services and the decision-making for their combat.


## The ABC day care case

On June 5, 2009, the ABC day-care center in Hermosillo , Sonora caught fire, causing the death of 49 children. The tragic event prompted the parents of the victims to demand from the IMSS the clarification of the facts as it is a child care center subrogated by the Institute.

As head of the IMSS, Daniel Karam was in charge of leading the dialogue roundtables and following up the investigation. In early 2010, he was blame by members of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation as a possible responsible for the fire at the ABC day-care center and although he was exonerated, three judges of the Supreme Court considered that his conduct in the case was incorrect.

Karam was summoned to several appearances in the Mexico's Congress to clarify the responsibility of those involved and the name of the owners of the day-care center concerned.

Upon his departure from the IMSS, Daniel Karam assured that he left an orderly Institute, walking and with well-diagnosed challenges.
