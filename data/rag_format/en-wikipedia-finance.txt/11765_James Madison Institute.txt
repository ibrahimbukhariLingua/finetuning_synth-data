James Madison Institute


# James Madison Institute



The **James Madison Institute** (**JMI**) is a conservative American think tank headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida in the United States. It is a member of the State Policy Network. The organization's stated mission is "to tether the Sunshine State to the wisdom of free-market capitalism, limited government, the rule of law, economic liberty, and the principles that have made our nation great."


## History

JMI was founded in Tallahassee, Florida in 1987 by J. Stanley Marshall, a former president of Florida State University. The institute is named after James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, third Secretary of State, author of the U.S. Constitution, and co-author of *The Federalist Papers*.


## Policy positions

The institute is a supporter of increasing access to all educational options available in Florida through educational savings accounts (ESAs).

The institute works to promote small government solutions to the fast changing technological environment. JMI works to close the digital divide, stop federal regulatory overreach of American tech innovators, and prevent digital discrimination.

The institute believes that direct personal responsibility for health care controls costs and provides individuals with incentives to make healthy choices. JMI supports market-based, consumer-driven reforms such as health savings accounts (HSAs) as a way to improve the quality of health services and increase access to the uninsured as well as promoting greater price transparency in healthcare.

Various JMI studies have shown that economic growth varies inversely with tax growth and that, dollar-for-dollar, private sector activity is more productive than public sector activity. JMI supports reforms that emphasize low tax rates and less government spending. In 2015, JMI launched the Center for Economic Prosperity.

JMI is a member of the advisory board of Project 2025, a collection of conservative and right-wing policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation to reshape the United States federal government and consolidate executive power should the Republican nominee win the 2024 presidential election.
