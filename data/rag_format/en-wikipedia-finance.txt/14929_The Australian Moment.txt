The Australian Moment


# The Australian Moment



***The Australian Moment: How We Were Made for These Times*** is a 2012 Australian economics book by George Megalogenis. It explains how Australia has been able to weather recent world economic problems relatively unscathed.


## Reception

Dennis Altman, writing in *The Sydney Morning Herald*, described *The Australian Moment* as "a detailed and rather economist account of mainstream politics during the past 40 years.", and although calling Megalogenis "one of the country's sanest political journalists" found that "in the end his views reflect the dominant consensus of the chattering classes: Hawke is the best post-Menzies leader because he led the way in deregulating the economy.", and concluded "The thesis of The Australian Moment is fascinating, but it deserves a far more thought-through argument and one that recognises the equal claims of countries such as Brazil or Turkey that seem more likely than Australia to be seen as global models. .. It is unfortunate that there is not more time for our best journalists to step back, reflect more and write more slowly."

*The Australian Moment* has also been reviewed by *The Spectator*, *Australian Book Review*, *Inside Story*, *Institute of Public Affairs Review*, and *Policy*.
