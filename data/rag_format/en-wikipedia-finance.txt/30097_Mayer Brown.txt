## History

Mayer Brown was founded in Chicago in the late 1800’s. Among its earliest clients were retail giant Sears Roebuck and Co.

The three firms that now form the core of Mayer Brown were all founded in the 19th century. The US portion of the firm was founded in 1881 in Chicago, by Adolf Kraus and Levy Mayer, and was shortly thereafter known as *Kraus, Mayer & Brackett*. After several changes in name to reflect its growing membership, the firm eventually became known in the US as *Mayer, Brown & Platt*.

In 2002, the firm merged with British law firm Rowe & Maw which was established in 1895 in London and operated under that name until joining with *Mayer, Brown & Platt* in 2002 to form *Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw*. In 2007, the amalgamated firm shortened its name to *Mayer Brown*.

Johnson Stokes & Master was formed in 1863 in Hong Kong, and known formerly as Mayer Brown JSM after merging with *Mayer Brown* in 2008.

Mayer Brown has offices in Asia, Europe, the Americas and the Middle East. In Brazil, the firm has an association with Tauil & Chequer Advogados. The firm operates as a collective of separate legal entities with offices in 14 countries. In October 2022, the firm launched its own joint law venture with Singapore law firm PK Wong & Nair LLC known as Mayer Brown PK Wong & Nair PTE. Ltd. The firms' other Asia office is in Tokyo.

As of 2009, the firm represented 89 companies of the Fortune 500.

In May 2024, It announced that it had reached an agreement to split from its China operations, with its Hong Kong entity JSM set to oversee the Beijing and Shanghai offices, amid tensions in U.S.-China relations.


## *Pro bono* work

Mayer Brown is a signatory to the Pro Bono Institute's Law Firm Pro Bono Challenge, which commits the firm to devote 3 percent of total billable time to pro bono work and a member of the UK Joint Protocol on Pro Bono Work, which stipulates that pro bono legal work must be carried out to the same standard as chargeable work.

Partner John F. Halbleib represented the Milton Hershey School on a pro bono basis from 1998 to 2002.

In 2001, lawyer Lee Rubin represented the National Security Archives in an effort by the U.S. State Department to recover 10,000 pages of transcripts of telephone conversations from former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger

Ward Johnson, a managing partner in the firm’s Northern California office, secured the release of Ken Oliver who had been convicted in 1997 to life in prison under California’s "three strikes" law. Oliver spent 23 years in prison before Johnson secured his release in 2017 along with a $125,000 settlement for violating Oliver’s civil rights.

Attorney Brian Netter spent four years working pro bono to have the District of Columbia’s budget freed from federal control in a case tied to the 2012 Budget Autonomy Act.

Partner Marcia Maack, the director of pro-bono activities for the firm, helped secure a special immigrant visa in 2017 for an interpreter who had served American forces in Iraq.

In 2017 attorney Andrew Pincus represented the city of Seattle in a pro bono lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s threats against sanctuary cities that refused to aid in federal immigration crackdowns. That same year, Pincus and others represented two Yemeni men who had been detained at the Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. after Trump signed the first ban on travelers from seven majority Muslim countries.

Partners Nicole Saharsky, Michael Scodro and Marcia Goodman along with associates Minh Nguyen-Dang and Carmen Longoria-Green, obtained a landmark settlement for the players on the US Women’s National Soccer Team (USWNT) in their 2019 equal-pay lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation (USSF). The parties agreed to settle for $24 million in backpay damages and a guarantee of equal pay going forward for all games, including for the World Cup. This is the first commitment from a major US sports federation to pay female and male athletes equally.

In 2019, Mayer Brown obtained a nationwide injunction against the US government and its decision to terminate temporary protected status for 60,000 Haitians.

Attorneys Matthew Ingber, Christopher Mikesh, and Justin Perkins secured asylum in the United States for a 12-year old Nigerian chess prodigy and his family.

Attorneys from Mayer Brown represented a group of migrants in 2021 and successfully argued that asylum seekers coming to U.S. ports of entry have rights under U.S. law that cannot be denied by preventing them from physically crossing the border.

Beginning in 2021, the firm led a coalition of 20 law firms and corporate legal departments working to evacuate nearly 150 Asian University for Women (AUW) students in Afghanistan and placing them at universities throughout the U.S. to continue their studies.

## Role in Refco Inc. collapse

Refco was a New York-based broker of commodities and futures contracts. In 2005, the company filed for bankruptcy after significant evidence of accounting fraud surfaced. In the wake of the collapse, a lawsuit was filed in 2007 against Mayer Brown and one of its partners, Joseph Collins. In November 2012, Collins was found guilty on multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud for his role in preparing Refco's IPO. Meyer Brown agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle legal claims that it "aided a $1.5 billion fraud scheme that produced a flurry of criminal convictions.”


## Role in the removal of a Tiananmen Square massacre statue

In October 2021, Mayer Brown was hired by the University of Hong Kong to help remove a statue memorialising the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre from its campus. The statue, known as the *Pillar of Shame*, was on loan from its creator, Danish sculptor Jens Galschiøt, had been placed in the campus for more than 20 years.

The law firm issued a letter to Hong Kong Alliance, a pro-democracy organization which had erected the statue, requesting that that sculpture be removed. The request to remove the statue attracted global criticism. Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod raised the matter with the Chinese government while United States Senator Pat Toomey criticized the removal attempt as an attempt to "rewrite history". Galschiøt, the sculpture's creator, compared the law firm's handling to Italian mafia methods and said, "I believe that Mayer Brown is morally and ethically responsible for helping to destroy the only mark of remembrance of the Tiananmen peace plan that exists on Chinese territory."

In response, the university defended its position by saying that the decision was based on “the latest risk assessment and legal advice”. In a statement, Mayer Brown said, "We were asked to provide a specific service on a real estate matter for our long-term client, the University of Hong Kong... Our legal advice is not intended as commentary on current or historical events." This response prompted the press and activists to draw comparisons with the law firm's reaction following the murder of George Floyd. The firm had issued a statement following Floyd's murder in June 2020, that "[a]s members of the legal community, we bear a special and heightened responsibility. We understand that the rule of law requires that everyone, and especially those in power, be held accountable for their actions."

Two days after the removal deadline set by the law firm, and while the sculpture was still in place despite the deadline had already passed, Mayer Brown confirmed that they would stop representing the university regarding the sculpture removal.
