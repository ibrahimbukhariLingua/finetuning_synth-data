Gross metropolitan product


# Gross metropolitan product



**Gross metropolitan product** (**GMP**) is a monetary measure that calculates the total economic output of a statistical metropolitan unit during a specific time period. It represents the market value of all final goods and services produced within the unit, similar to how GDP measures national economic output.


## European Union

GMP is calculated annually by the Eurostat for NUTS 3-based metropolitan regions.


## United States

GMP is calculated annually by the Bureau of Economic Analysis within the United States Department of Commerce. This is done only for metropolitan statistical areas and not for micropolitan statistical areas, metropolitan divisions, combined statistical areas, and BEA economic areas.
