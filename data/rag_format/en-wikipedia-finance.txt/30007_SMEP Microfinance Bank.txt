## History

SMEP Mircofinance Bank started out in 1975 as a relief arm of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). This program's objective was to feed the poor people in Nairobi's Mathare slum. Later on, NCCK realized that the poor needed to be self-reliant and economically empower and thus converted the feeding program into a micro-credit scheme known as **Small Scale Business Enterprise** (SSBE).

In 1998 the Small Scale Business Enterprise (SSBE) was renamed **Small and Micro Enterprise Programme** and in 1999 it was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. In 2008, Small and Micro Enterprise Programme adopted its acronym "SMEP" as its official name and was registered as a company limited by shares. SMEP partnered with Kiva in 2009 and has seen them been able to extend credit on behalf of other Kiva lenders.

On 14 December 2010, SMEP was awarded a deposit taking licence by the Central Bank of Kenya. Making it the third deposit taking microfinance institution (MFI) in Kenya. The firm's name was then changed to SMEP DTM i.e. SMEP Deposit Taking Microfinance. SMEP DTM sought to raise capital through private placement in the last quarter of 2012. The share offer was valued at KSH 1.6 billion. This share offer only manage to receive 16.7 per cent subscription making it an unsuccessful offer.

The firm adopted the name **SMEP Microfinance Bank** in 2013 in line with the Microfinance Amendment Act of 2013. The firm entered the insurance business in 2015 with the launch of its subsidiary, the SMEP Insurance Agency company.
