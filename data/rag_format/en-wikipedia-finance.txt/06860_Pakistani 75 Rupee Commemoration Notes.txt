### Legal status

During Eid al-Fitr, shopkeepers across Pakistan refused to accept the 75-rupee notes, sparking rumors of their potential demonetization. In response, State Bank of Pakistan spokesperson Abid Qamar addressed the issue in a video posted on the central bank’s official Twitter account. He reassured the public that the 75-rupee commemorative note remains fully valid for transactions and clarified that all currency is issued under Section 25 of the State Bank of Pakistan Act, with no expiration date for the note. Qamar also dismissed claims that the government had withdrawn or discontinued the banknote.


### Omissions of key figures

The commemorative note, issued in 2022 for Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary, features portraits of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Fatima Jinnah, Muhammad Iqbal, and Syed Ahmad Khan. This selection generated some debate, with critics noting the omission of figures such as Pakistan’s first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, which they viewed as significant.


## Supply

The State Bank of Pakistan's finance director, Qadar Baksh, explained that the Rs. 75 banknote, a legal tender, will not impact the overall money supply. Of the 4.3 billion notes being circulated in 2023, only 65 million will be the Rs. 75 denomination, making it a limited, one-time release.
