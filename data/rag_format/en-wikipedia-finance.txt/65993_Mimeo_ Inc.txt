## History

Mimeo was founded in 1998 by Key Compton, Jeff Stewart (Mimeo.com board member and first Mimeo.com chief executive officer) and Dave Meadows. A few months later, David Uyttendaele (Mimeo's Chief technology officer), Scott Klemm and John Delbridge (former Chief operating officer and Chief financial officer, current Mimeo CEO), joined the founding team. Stewart, Delbridge and Uyttendaele first met on the second floor of their freshman dormitory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. They reunited in 1998 after Stewart and Uyttendaele launched and sold Internet consulting company Square Earth to Proxicom, which is now ICrossing.
In 1998, the company launched with the goal of becoming the print dial tone for the Internet. The company developed proprietary technology and a proof of concept, leading to the release of a functional version in mid-1999. The strategy was to leverage the time and cost savings that come from being adjacent to major shipping and distribution hubs.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The first print facility was located next to the FedEx distribution hub in Memphis, Tennessee.

In 2000, the company reported employment levels of 80 people and 422 customers. Unfortunately, Mimeo was spending more than it was taking in, losing $1M per month. To accelerate growth the company hired an experienced sales professional, John F. Lyons as CEO in May 2001, replacing company founder Jeff Stewart. As of 2002, Customers included 300 of the Fortune 2000.

In October 2004, the company's growth was recognized by Inc. (magazine), as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. having been ranked at number 186 on the Inc. 500. The CEO, John Lyons left the company at this time replaced by John Delbridge while a search for a full-time CEO was launched.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2005, Adam Slutsky, former COO, CFO and director of Moviefone joined the company as CEO, replacing John F. Lyons. In September 2006, the company purchased three Kodak Nexpress Color printers and reported a total of 328 employees. They also added add several key executives, including Tom Karrat, EVP Sales and Marketing, Charlie Corr, as VP Corporate Strategy and Coleen Smith as Chief People Officer. At the time, Mimeo reported growth rates of 50% over the past four years. The company achieved growth rates of 68% in 2005 versus 2004, reaching $50 million in total revenue.

In December 2008, Mimeo opened a 75,000-square-foot web-enabled print production and distribution facility in Newark, New Jersey, with a capacity of 1,000,000 pages per day. This was the second print and distribution facility owned by the company. By 2008 Mimeo employed more than 500 people, serving 4000 customers, 38% of which are Fortune 500 customers. From 2007 to early 2010, Mimeo.com saw steady growth and expansion with revenues growing from $39.6 million in 2006 to $60 million in 2009. In June 2018 the company announced it would close the facility.

In July 2011 Mimeo expanded into Europe with the acquisition of Cambridgeshire, England-based CLE, led by Jamie Wardley. Wardley was immediately appointed general manager of Mimeo Europe. The acquisition expanded Mimeo's business to include custom products such as school yearbooks via SPC Verlag and on-demand funeral cards via Gateway Funeral Cards. In Q4 2011, CLE moved into a new facility in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England, that serves as the headquarters for Mimeo Europe as well Mimeo's first production and distribution centre in Europe.

In 2013, Mimeo had more than 600 employees and revenues of approximately $100 million. The Memphis facility has 324 people with plans to expand to 514 employees by 2016. The company hires approximately 200 temporary workers to meet holiday season demand for photo greeting cards, calendars and albums. In 2014, Mimeo expanded in Europe with an acquisition of Germany's Koebcke. With this acquisition, the employee count grew to over 800 employees.

In January 2013, John Delbridge took over as the CEO and president, following Adam Slutsky's departure. For the period 2005 to 2012 Mimeo reported an annualized growth rate of +25%.

In 2017, Mimeo launched MimeoPhotos, continuing its expertise from its former white-label relationships with Apple, Snapfish, and American Greetings. MimeoPhotos helps amateur and professional photographers turn meaningful moments into premium photo products you can touch, hold, or hang.
