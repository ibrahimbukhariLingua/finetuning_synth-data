Blockchain Global


# Blockchain Global



**Blockchain Global Limited** is a Bitcoin mining and management consulting company. Its headquarter is located at Melbourne, Australia. Founded as **Bitcoin Group**, after attempting to become the first digital currency company to launch an IPO without 'backdoor listing', the company expanded its focus into consulting and corporate fraud and extortion prevention.


## History

Bitcoin Group was founded in 2014 as a bitcoin mining company as a result of a partnership between Sam Lee, Allan Guo and Vincent Vu.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

As of September 2015ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, with seven bitcoin mining locations in Australia, China, and Thailand, Bitcoin Group's mining operation generated 6.2 peta hashes, approximately 15.7% of the Global Hash Power. The company made a submission to the Australian Senate’s Economics References Committee for their 2015 inquiry into digital currencies. The submission advised the committee that while the company did not agree with the ruling on the GST treatment of digital currencies by the Australian Taxation Office, its ambitions would have been more difficult to realize without the regulatory clarity that it provided.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Bitcoin Group announced that it would pursue an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in October 2014. The attempt was delayed by two stop orders from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Following ASIC's request for an Independent Expert Report, the company undertook a third attempt to list on the ASX through an IPO, planning to issue 100 million new shares by January 2016 and thereby raise $20 million at 20¢ a share and achieve a market capitalisation of $32.9 million based on 164,870,930 shares on completion of the offer. Bitcoin Group closed their offer on 25 January 2016 after raising $5.9 million, less than a third of the target, and in March 2016 withdrew the offer and refunded subscribers after ASX deemed their liquidity insufficient. The company said the capital report by an independent accounting firm which the exchange had required did not take into account the expected rise in bitcoin prices following block halving in July 2016.

In August 2016 Bitcoin Group rebranded as Blockchain Global to reflect a broadened focus including management consulting and business incubation. The company later developed the blockchain exchange platform ACX.io; in February 2017 it reached an agreement with Digital X to take over the function of that company's blockchain exchange platform, Digital X Direct. ACX subsequently ceased operations abruptly with customers unable to access their assets.

Former director of failed crypto company Blockchain Global has been banned from leaving Australia, with the company owing $58 million after its collapse. Chinese citizen Liang ‘Allan’ Guo was issued a travel ban on February 20, being deemed a flight risk, and has been ordered to surrender any passports in his possession.
