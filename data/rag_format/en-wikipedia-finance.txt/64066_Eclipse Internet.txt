## History

*Eclipse Internet* began in 1995 as a South West internet service provider utilising an 0845 dialup number.

In 2001, Eclipse launched its first Broadband product, based on BT's wholesale ADSL service. In 2004, the company was purchased by KCOM Group PLC for a total of £12.5 million. £9.5 million was paid in cash, whilst the remainder was paid in KCOM Group PLC shares. In 2005, Eclipse began trials of a combined digital television, telephone and broadband service.

Eclipse also rejigged its broadband packages into three new packages and removed its fair use policy, the only restrictions on use now being the amount of data downloaded.

In 2010, Eclipse gave an official response to proposals by Ofcom to investigate Net Neutrality in the UK.

In 2021, KCOM sold the Eclipse customer base to Global 4 Group who serves the customers as Eclipse Broadband Limited.
