## Work

The BSA has commented publicly on a range of topics, including transparency in business, VAT levels for public service providers, and the role of outsourcing in delivering public services. It publishes an Annual Review of the Business Services Sector, which outlines the economic and social contribution of the sector to the UK.

The BSA submits statements to government ahead of the Autumn Statement and Spending Reviews and responds to consultations from the Scottish and UK Governments. It is a signatory of the Armed Forces Corporate Covenant, Let Britain Fly, and makes annual statements to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on sustainable palm oil.

In 2015, the Business Services Association launched the Responsible Cleaner Scheme for companies in the contract cleaning sector. It promotes the welfare and development of cleaners and the professionalisation of the industry.

The BSA commissions research by Oxford Economics, which has shown that the business services sector accounts for 8 percent of all gross value added UK economic output and supports 3.3 million jobs in the UK.
