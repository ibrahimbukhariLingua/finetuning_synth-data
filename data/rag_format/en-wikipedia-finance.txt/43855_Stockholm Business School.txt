# Stockholm Business School

SBS offers BSc, MSc programmes along with PhD. Through close ties with other academic departments and regular collaborations with key business actors, the School has become a melting pot for interdisciplinary research and education generating new perspectives on current topics within business and beyond.


## History

SBS had a modest beginning at the end of the 1950s when Stockholm School of Economics offered a dozen study places to students at the Stockholm College (the University was founded in 1960). As interest from students was high, the number of study places however multiplied rapidly and the courses offered increased in number and content.

In 1960 Stockholm College received university status and became Stockholm University. Two years later, in 1962, SBS became an independent department of the University. Two people in particular were of great significance during the establishment of Stockholm Business School; Professor Gerhard Törnquist and Professor T. Paulsson Frenckner.
