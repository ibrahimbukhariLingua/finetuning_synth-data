## Controversy

From 2003 to 2010, Agility supplied food and related products to U.S. troops and contractors in Kuwait and Iraq under a series of Prime Vendor contracts awarded by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). In May 2017, Agility and the U.S. Justice Department reached a legal settlement to resolve legal issues involving allegations that the company overcharged DLA on the food contracts. The company pleaded to a misdemeanor involving a single invoice for $551. The misdemeanor was unrelated to the Justice Department's original felony allegations, which were dropped. The company also agreed to a payment of $95 million to resolve parallel civil proceedings.
