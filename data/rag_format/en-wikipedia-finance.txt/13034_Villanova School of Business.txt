## History

Villanova University was founded in 1842 and named after St. Thomas of Villanova, a 16th-century Augustinian saint, writer, educator, and bishop. In the early 1900s, there was a trend to specialize collegiate studies in specific fields. Thus, the Villanova School of Business, then called The Division of Commerce and Finance, was founded by Joseph C. Bartley in 1922. The school was later renamed The Villanova School of Business in 2006.

Since 1922, VSB has had nine deans:

* Joseph Bartley:1922-1962
* Phillip F. Barrett: 1962-1976
* Alvin A. Clay: 1977-1995
* John A. Pearce II: 1995-1996
* Tim Monahan: 1996-2003
* James M. Danko: 2005-2011

## Bartley Hall

The Villanova School of Business is based in Bartley Hall, located on the main campus of Villanova University. When Villanova College became a university in 1953, it undertook an extensive building program which benefited the school of business. The new facility, now known as Bartley Hall, represented a major expansion of classrooms and laboratory facilities for business students at the university.

Bartley Hall has continued to improve and underwent a $30M renovation in 2002, adding 65,000 square feet to the building. Today, Bartley Hall includes 33 classrooms, 6 lecture halls and a 130-seat auditorium.

In addition to its classrooms, Bartley Hall has continued to add spaces. Two notable features are The Laboratory for Advancement of Interdisciplinary Research (LAIR) and The Victoria and Justin Gmelich '90 Lab for Financial Markets. The LAIR provides a physical space for VSB faculty and students to conduct research using experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups and other primary sources. The 1,500-square-foot Gmelich Lab for Financial Markets replicates a Wall Street trading desk.

Bartley Hall is not only used as a learning space for students, but also as a study space and dining hall. Bartley also houses a coffee shop.
