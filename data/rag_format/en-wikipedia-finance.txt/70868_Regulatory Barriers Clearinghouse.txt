Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse


# Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse



The **Regulatory Barriers Clearinghouse** (RBC) collects, processes, assembles, and disseminates information on existing barriers that inhibit the production and conservation of affordable housing. RBC is part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) overall effort to help create cohesive, economically viable, and healthy communities. It was created in response to the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000 and in recognition that as much as a third of the cost of a new home is driven by state and local regulations.


## RBC's Services

RBC maintains a searchable online database, which categorizes actual state and local regulatory reform strategies that support affordable housing. The database now contains over 4,000 barriers and proposed solutions. Database entries are divided into the following 10 categories: administrative processes, building and housing codes, fair housing and neighborhood deconcentration, fees and dedications, planning and growth restrictions, redevelopment/infill, rent controls, state/local environment and historic rules, tax policies, and zoning and land development.

RBCâ€™s webpage hosts a *This Just In* section that highlights a variety of useful and interesting database entries, and the Strategy of the Month Club, a bimonthly listserv that features new and innovative approaches to overcoming regulatory barriers.

RBC also staffs a toll-free phone line, Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m, Eastern Time, along with email support.
