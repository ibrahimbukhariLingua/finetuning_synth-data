After the 2010 floods, MJSF established refugee camps accommodating more than 10,000 affected individuals, providing food supplies to over 20,000 people and clean water for over 100,000 people during the 4-month relief operations period. MJSF worked in coordination with the UN agencies and INGOs.

Apart from humanitarian services, Siddiqui is also known to support the arts.

He served on the board of Acumen, a global social enterprise investment firm, for nine years.


### Special Assistant to the Prime Minister

Soon after Shahid Khaqan Abbasi became Prime Minister of Pakistan, Siddiqui joined the Government and served as a Special Assistant to the Prime Minister with the status of a Minister of State from August 2017 until May 2018.


### Ambassador to the US

In March 2018, he was appointed as the Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and commenced his duties on 29 May 2018.

As Ambassador, he handled numerous regular engagements and meetings such as Congressional Outreach Programs, Think-tank meetings, Trade & Economy sittings, Embassy events, and Media as well as academia addressing.

Prior to his appointment as the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) claimed that Siddiqui was involved in matters relating to three companies: Azgard, Agritech, and Monte Bello which caused losses to investors and shareholders. Their claim was that he's the director of Azgard which siphoned moneys amounting to €23.758 million to purchase the company Monte Bello SRL using another company Fairytal SRL Sweden which resulted in loss for shareholders. He also sold shares under Azgard to government institutions at higher market rate in order to compensate for the company's loans.

On the contrary, other reports suggested that the allegations from NAB were baseless. These allegations were politically driven because the Azgard and Agritech matters were already sub-judice prior to Siddiqui's appointment and Siddiqui was neither a party nor a respondent in these proceedings. Siddiqui had also left the board of directors of Montebellos parent company four years prior to its bankruptcy. The counterclaims, thus, indicated that the allegations in the investigation were an attempt to defame him and impede his appointment as ambassador. The court decided in favour of Siddiqui.

Siddiqui's reputation and work was acknowledged by US commentators while it was frequently criticized by Indian media.

In June 2018, Siddiqui presented his credentials to US President Donald Trump.

In July 2018, Siddiqui met James Mattis, the US Secretary of Defence. The meeting took place at the Pentagon where Siddiqui received a guard of honor on behalf of Pakistan.

During celebrations for Pakistan's 71st Anniversary of Independence in August 2018 at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Ambassador Alice Wells, the chief guest at the event, acknowledged Pakistan's sacrifices against terrorism.

In October 2018, the Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi announced a change in Pakistan's ambassadorial appointments to multiple countries including the United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Serbia, Cuba amongst others. The individuals being changed were appointed during the regime of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

Speaking of Siddiqui’s role with regards to Pak-US relations at the launch of the Pak-Americana Report by Tabadlab on February 12, 2021, the Former Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, Salman Bashir, credited Ali Jehangir Siddiqui for overcoming obstacles and specifically making possible the Pakistan PM's visit to the White House.


### Ambassador for Foreign Investment

On 13 June 2019, Ali Jehangir Siddiqui was appointed as the Ambassador for Foreign Investments in an Honorary Capacity.

Under his tenure due to the efforts of the PTI government in encouraging foreign and local investments in the country, Hutchison Port Holdings—Hong Kong–based port operator—committed on 15 October 2019 to invest US$240 million in Karachi Port in order to make it a major trading hub.

The Pakistani Prime Minister, Imran Khan, received the delegation of the group in October 2019, led by their Managing Director, Eric Ip.

## Court cases

Siddiqui has earlier been called by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) with respect to allegations that one of his companies, Azgard Nine Limited (ANL) had manipulated its stock price resulting in financial losses to investors. Despite passage of several years, no allegations have yet been proven and Ali Siddiqui has based his defence on the premise that he was neither a party nor a respondent to the cases which negates any connection with the same. After a period of 1.5 years, NAB dismissed the case due to inability to establish facts. All allegations were dropped and Siddiqui was cleared by the court of law.
