# Fred D. Schaufeld



**Fred D. Schaufeld** (born September 23, 1959) is an entrepreneur, venture capital investor, sports team owner, philanthropist and patent holder.

Schaufeld is a co-founder and managing director of SWaN & Legend Venture Partners (SWaN). He is a partner in Monumental Sports & Entertainment. He also is a partner in the Washington Nationals (MLB), Team Liquid (esports), the Professional Fighters League and the Hill Top House Hotel, Harpers Ferry, WV.

Schaufeld owns American Bike Ride, parent of the DC Bike Ride and currently sits on the boards of Sugar23, DuraStat, José Andrés Group, Mindshow, Georgiamune and Telos (Nasdaq: TLS). He previously was an advisor to the boards of Cava, ClassEDU, Growcentia and Biothred and previously sat on the boards of American Honors College, Anonymous Content, Asurion, Bio-Warn, Framebridge, KIND Healthy Snacks, NEW, OrderGroove and SocialRadar.

Prior to SWaN, Schaufeld founded and led National Electronics Warranty Corporation (NEW), which was acquired by Asurion in 2008 (now NEW Asurion). NEW Asurion is the world's largest consumer product protection company, employing more than 20,000 people worldwide. During his tenure, NEW was recognized by Inc. Magazine in its "Inc. 500" list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. Mr. Schaufeld is the patent holder of the Rigid Insurance Form (Patent #4,874,187) and a Founder and former President of the Service Contract Industry Council (SCIC), a national Extended warranty trade association that works with lawmakers across the country to develop fair and uniform regulation to protect consumers.

In 1996, Schaufeld and his partner, Tony Nader, presented the financially troubled Best Buy Corporation (NYSE: BBY) with their concept: "Making Best Buy Even Better," suggesting comprehensive consumer extended warranties could be sold without pressure or sales commissions at significantly lower prices than offered by BBY's main competitor, Circuit City. The adoption of the program led BBY to become the single biggest NYSE large-cap turnaround/growth stock as of that time.


## SWaN & Legend

Along with Anthony Nader and Cliff White, Schaufeld co-founded SWaN Investors in 2006. He is one of five managing directors of SWaN & Legend, a multi-stage venture capital firm that invests in high-growth, high-quality organizations and the entrepreneurs behind them. A few of the companies in which the firm has invested include Anonymous Content, Sugar23, Custom Ink, KIND Healthy Snacks, Optoro, Quad Learning, Inc., José Andrés Group, Bigteams, Framebridge and UrbanStems.
