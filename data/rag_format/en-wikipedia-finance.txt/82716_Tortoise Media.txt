Tortoise Media


# Tortoise Media



***Tortoise Media*** is a British news website co-founded in 2018 by former BBC News director and *The Times* editor James Harding and former US ambassador to the United Kingdom Matthew Barzun. Tortoise produces podcasts and holds live discussion events called "ThinkIns" and "Discussion Lates" in the London area. It is part of the slow journalism movement.


## History

*Tortoise Media* was announced on Kickstarter in 2018, where it raised more than £500,000. Permanent invitations to ThinkIns and Discussion Lates were part of higher-tier Kickstarter reward packages. It also received private investment. Its website went live in April 2019.

Writing for *The Guardian* in 2018, Emily Bell said that Tortoise drew from ideas tried by *The Guardian*, *Axios*, *Vox* and *Quartz*. She said there was a trend of increased involvement of private wealth in the journalism industry, comparing Tortoise and its wealthy, well-connected founders and backers to Mark Benioff's purchase of *Time* and Jeff Bezos's purchase of the *Washington Post*. She also said that Tortoise's financial strength allowed it to attract high-profile journalists. The company received the Innovation of the Year award from the British Journalism Awards in 2019.

In September 2024 it was reported that Tortoise had approached the Guardian Media Group—proprietor of *The Guardian* and *The Observer*—with an offer to purchase *The Observer* for an undisclosed price. *Guardian* and *Observer* journalists voted to strike on 4 and 5 December 2024 in protest over a sale that they said would betray the commitment of the Scott Trust—owner of the Guardian Media Group—to the *Observer*.

As the strike was taking place, the Scott Trust agreed in principle to go through with the sale.
