**PharMerica** is a Fortune 1000 company formed in January 2007 from the merger of Kindred Healthcare's pharmacy business with a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen.

The company is the second largest in the institutional pharmacy services market, with revenues of $1.9 billion and a customer base of 330,000 "beds" in 41 U.S. states.
