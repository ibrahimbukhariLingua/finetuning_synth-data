## History

At its initial launch in 2004, Infosys Consulting focused on recruitment in the United States to launch programs in a Global delivery model.

In 2012, Infosys acquired Lodestone Management Consultants, based out of Zurich, Switzerland for $350m USD. Lodestone increased the Infosys Consulting client base by nearly 200 companies across different industry segments, and at the time of acquisition, Infosysâ€™ consulting and systems-integration business contributed to 31% of total revenue. The acquisition brought on 850 new employees, with 750 being front-line consulting delivery professionals.

In 2015, Infosys Ltd decided to integrate Lodestone, at the time a subsidiary of Infosys, and the Management Consulting Services unit into the singular Infosys Consulting unit that resides within Infosys Limited.

In 2015, Infosys acquired Noah Consulting LLC for $70m USD. Noah Consulting is based out of Houston, TX and primarily serves customers in the oil and gas industry, providing information and technology services. As of September 2017, it was unclear whether the brand would be a subsidiary or merged into the larger Infosys Consulting.

After three-years as interim CEO of Infosys, Dr. Vishal Sikka resigned in August 2017. In a personal note to board colleagues, he cited a 'drumbeat of distractions' and "false, baseless, malicious and increasingly personal attacks" as his reason for leaving Infosys. Anonymous employees of the company were quoted in the press as saying that this was due to a long-running feud with Infosys' founders over the new direction Sikka was reportedly taking Infosys. The current director and CEO is Salil Parekh, former executive at Capgemini business consultancy.

In 2020, Infosys made an alliance with Avaloq to improve wealth management capability across digital channels.
