## History

As the business grew and more stores opened, Wood T. Brookshire and cousin W.A. Brookshire withdrew from the company and started Brookshire's, which now operates independently in Tyler, Texas.

The following growth through the 1950s and 60s, Austin Brookshire's three sons, Oscar, Eugene, and R.A., assumed leadership and grew the company to more than 70 stores. In 1999, as the surviving brothers neared retirement, the company embarked on an employee-owner stock buy out. By 2006, Brookshire Brothers achieved 100% employee-ownership. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Brookshire Brothers continue to expand its footprint. It acquired the assets of David's Supermarkets out of Grandview, Texas in 2014 and built additional stores in Zavalla, Apple Springs, Pilot Point (at the location of a closed ALCO when that firm went out of business), Hamilton, and Canyon Lake, Texas.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2018, Brookshire Brothers announced they would provide delivery and curbside pickup from select locations. The services are offered through Rosie, which is a grocery delivery and pickup provider. The service was initially offered at 2 locations in Lufkin, Texas.

Brookshire Brothers Company is now owned entirely by its 5,600 employees; Brookshire's Food and Pharmacy have stayed in the family but are a separate chain.
