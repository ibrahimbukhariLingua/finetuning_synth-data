Armenia Fund


# Armenia Fund



**Armenia Fund** (full name **Hayastan All Armenian Fund**, Armenian: Հայաստան համահայկական հիմնադրամ) was established in 1994 in Los Angeles, California. Armenia Fund, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, non-governmental, non-political corporation, headquartered in Yerevan. Serving as the United States' Western Region affiliate of the "Hayastan" All-Armenian Fund along with its nineteen subsidiaries around the world, Armenia Fund, Inc. has issued over $120 million of electricity development guarantee and humanitarian revenue for Armenia. Lately, the government of Armenia has been contributing to the fund since the fund has been receiving less support and not being able to meet its initial goals.


## Goals

Armenia Fund attempts to rebuild Armenia's economy and assist in the well-being of life in the region. Additionally, the organization attempts to rebuild major infrastructures damaged in Karabakh during the first Nagorno-Karabakh War. The Fund has adopted a policy to go "Beyond Bricks and Mortar" to provide sustainability for projects it sponsors.


## Network

"Hayastan" All-Armenian Fund, Armenia Fund USA Inc.'s parent organization, through its affiliate organizations has presence in 16 countries around the world: United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Great Britain, France, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Greece, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, and Australia.
