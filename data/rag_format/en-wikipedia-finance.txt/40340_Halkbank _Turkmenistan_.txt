## History

The first savings bank in the Turkmen SSR was opened on August 4, 1923.

Since January 1, 1941, 419 savings banks have been operating on the territory of the Turkmen SSR.

In 1963, the savings banks were transferred to the department of the State Bank.

After the banking reform of 1988, which resulted in the formation of a two-tier system of banks (the Central Bank and specialized banks), state savings banks from a specialized state bank serving the population and legal entities turned into a Savings Bank.

On April 30, 1993, the Turkmen Republican Bank of the State Bank of the USSR was transformed into the Savings Bank of Turkmenistan, and in 2001 it was renamed the **State Commercial Bank of Turkmenistan Halkbank**.

In 2021, the State Commercial Bank Halkbank was transformed into an open **Joint Stock Company Halkbank**. President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov signed the decree on reorganization of the bank at a government meeting.
