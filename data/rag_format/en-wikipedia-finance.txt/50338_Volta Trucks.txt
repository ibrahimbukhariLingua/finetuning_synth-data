Additionally, the company also confirmed the appointment of Meritor as the supplier for the Volta Zero's drivetrain component.

**2022**

In May 2022, Volta Trucks confirmed its entry strategy for products, services, and manufacturing for the North American market. The plan will see the first Volta Zero vehicles operating in Los Angeles by the end of 2023 by introducing a ‘Pilot Fleet’ of 100 Class 7 trucks in mid-2023. This fleet will be evaluated by US customers, before a scaling up of production for US Volta Trucks in 2024.

In June 2022, Volta Trucks announced the production of its first Volta Zero vehicle at its manufacturing facility in Steyr, Austria. Series production of customer specification vehicles is due to start in early 2023.

Volta Trucks also confirmed the location of its first Volta Trucks Hub in the UK, on White Hart Lane in Tottenham, north London. The facility covers 30,000 sq feet, operating eight workshop bays. The property, managed by LaSalle Investment Management, has a photovoltaic panel system on its roof, converting sunlight into energy for the site, and a passive solar wall, optimising the heating and ventilation of the building. It is also designed with a charging infrastructure to support 50 kW fast charging of Volta Zero vehicles while they are being maintained. Overall, the facility has an A+ EPC rating and has been designed to achieve the BREAAM ‘Excellent’ rating.

Volta trucks filed for bankruptcy in Sweden 17 of October 2023., but was almost immediately bought out of administration by Luxor Capital Partners, a hedge fund that had been one of its main financers. The UK site was closed and 600 staff lost their jobs. The business is expected to continue as a going concern once a new battery supply is agreed.


## The Volta Zero

In September 2020, Volta Trucks launched the 16-tonne Volta Zero, the world's first purpose-built, all-electric commercial vehicle designed for city-centre deliveries. The driver sits in a central driving position in a lowered cab to mirror the eyeline of other road users and pedestrians. Symmetrical sliding doors allow access in-and-out of either side of the cab. A glasshouse-style cab provides the driver with a 220 degree field of vision and has been designed to exceed the highest Direct Vision Standard rating of 5 stars by Transport for London. The Volta Zero is fitted with 160-200kWh batteries delivering a range of up to 200 km. Volta Trucks claim that the Volta Zero will have a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) that is less than the cost the same as petrol and diesel equivalents.

Volta Trucks launched the 16-tonne Volta Zero in September 2020, and confirmed in the same month that Nobl (formally Drinks Cubed), the London-based sustainable drinks brand, had signed the first multi-million-pound order for the supply of a fleet of Volta Zero vehicles into their distribution operations between 2022 and 2023.

In April 2022, Volta Trucks revealed the design of the 7.5- and 12-tonne variants, which bear a close visual relationship to the larger 16-tonne vehicle. The 7.5 and 12-tonne variants will be visually identical at the front, with the 12-tonne vehicle having a longer chassis and body, and second set of rear wheels and tyres, to accommodate the increased vehicle payload.

Battery capacity 150/164 kWh (usable/gross) standard range, 225/246 kWh (usable/gross) long range. As of mid-2023 refrigerated models only come with long range battery.


## Truck as a Service

In April 2022, Volta Trucks revealed its first ‘Volta Trucks Hub’ which will be in Bonneuil-sur-Marne, Paris. The hub will carry out routine servicing of vehicles. A further was announced Tottenham, London in late 2022 with two more in Madrid, Spain and Duisburg, Germany in March 2023.
