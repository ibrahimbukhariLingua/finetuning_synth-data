## Qualifications

The Accounting Technicians Ireland qualification combines professional exams with work experience. The Accounting Technicians Ireland diploma is divided into two parts, each of which is a qualification in its own right:

* Certificate for Accounting Technicians (1 year)
* Diploma for Accounting Technicians (2 years)

The certificate and diploma are National Framework of Qualifications Level 6 qualifications. The certificate and diploma are recognised as Qualifications and Credit Framework(QCF) level 4 and level 5 qualifications, respectively, in the UK.

Students study for the ATI qualifications full or part-time (normally as part of an apprenticeship with an accountant or company) through a college, or since 2008, directly with the ATI.

Members of the Accounting Technicians Ireland body are entitled to use the letters MIATI after their name. After eight years, members may be eligible to apply for fellow membership, who use the designation FIATI after their name. Other professional accountancy bodies recognise the qualification and offer exemptions from their examinations to Accounting Technicians Ireland graduates.

Students who complete the diploma can transfer to third year of some business, accounting, and finance degrees in DBS, IPA, Institute of Technology, Sligo, Waterford Institute of Technology, and CIT.
