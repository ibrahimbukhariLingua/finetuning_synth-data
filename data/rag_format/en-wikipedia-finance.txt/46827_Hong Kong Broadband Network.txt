### Founding and initial growth

HKBN Group became a listed company on 12 March 2015 under a new Cayman Islands-incorporated holding company **HKBN Ltd.**; Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited was under listed company City Telecom (or known as CTI) until CTI sold Hong Kong Broadband Network Limited. In May 2012, private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, acquired the company for HK$4.9 billion. City Telecom (Hong Kong) was then renamed into Hong Kong Television Network. The current holding company of the group, HKBN Ltd., was incorporated on 26 November 2014.


### Violation of the use on personal data

HKBN is the first company in Hong Kong to be convicted under section 35G of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance by the Magistrates' Court since the law amendment in 2013, which states that it is a criminal offence to fail to comply with a requirement from a data subject to cease to use their personal data in direct marketing.

HKBN's conviction relates to a customer complaint in April 2013; the customer had made an opt-out request to HKBN via both email and post and HKBN subsequently acknowledged receipt of the request in writing. However, the customer still received a voice message through their mobile phone in May 2013, informing the complainant of the termination of their service contract as well as to promote other services of HKBN.

HKBN pleaded not guilty since the call was merely a service renewal "reminder", however Magistrate Debbie Ng Chung-yee ruled that HKBN used the contract's expiry as an excuse to pitch new services, as promotions of new contracts has not been included in the service scope agreed to by subscribers. HKBN was fined HK$30,000 in September 2015.


### Expands to mobile broadband

In July 2016, HKBN has secured the Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) license from the Office of the Telecommunications Authority, as Hong Kong's 26th MVNO, to offer mobile services using its infrastructure of established mobile network operators. Partnering with SmarTone and China Mobile (Hong Kong), HKBN launched mobile services plans for personal and corporate consumers.
