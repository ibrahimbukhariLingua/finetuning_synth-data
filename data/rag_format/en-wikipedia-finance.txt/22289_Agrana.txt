## History

Agrana was founded in 1988 as a holding company for the Austrian sugar and Starch industry. Operations started with 3 sugar plants (Tulln, Leopoldsdorf and Hohenau), a potato starch plant (Gmünd) and a corn starch plant (Aschach). Company history should however be considered dating back to 1902, when raw sugar production started in Leopoldsdorf. Similarly, sugar production in Tulln had started in 1937.

The company went public on the Vienna Stock Exchange in 1991.

In 1990, Agrana took stakes in sugar and starch plants in Hungary, and investment in neighbouring countries followed.

From 2003 to 2005, Agrana started reducing its sugar business due to European Union quotas, and diversified in the fruit processing and juice concentrates businesses, acquiring several companies: Steirerobst, Vallosaft, Wink, Atys... As of 2012, Agrana operated 9 sugar plants, 5 starch plants and 37 processing sites for fruits throughout central Europe.
