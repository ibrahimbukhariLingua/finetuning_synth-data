## NHS competition and privatisation controversy

In 2010, while discussing British health reforms at a private healthcare industry conference in the US, Britnell said: "In future, The NHS will be a state insurance provider not a state deliverer", and that "The NHS will be shown no mercy and the best time to take advantage of this will be in the next couple of years." In the light of the subsequent controversy, KPMG issued a press statement on his behalf on 16 May 2011 which did not deny the accuracy of the quotations, but asserted that "The article in *The Observer* [15 May] attributes quotes to me that do not properly reflect discussions held at a private conference last October. Nor was I given the opportunity to respond ahead of publication." The *Health Service Journal* website published a longer statement from Britnell on 17 May. Commenting on the UK health service in an article for the Guardian Health Network, Britnell said "I'm proud to have worked for the NHS, with its great people, and now feel privileged to be able to work on health systems internationally."
