## Biography

Konstantin Nikolaev was born in Dnipropetrovsk on 5 March 1971.

In 1996, Nikolaev, Nikita Mishin, Andrei Filatov, and Alexey Mordashov formed Severstaltrans (Russian: "Северстальтранс") with Mordashov holding a 50% stake and the other three holding equal stakes of the remaining shares. In 1996, Igor Levitin became an employee of Severstaltrans and was the deputy director for transport engineering, rail transport and the operation of seaports from 1998 to 2004. In early 2008, Mordashov sold his 50% stake in Severstaltrans to Nikolaev, Mishin, and Filatov and then Severstaltrans changed its name to N-Trans (Russian: "Н-Транс"). In 2008, 70% of Globaltrans shares were held by N-Trans. In 2008, 30% of the shares of Cypriot-based Globaltrans Investments Plc were offered as an IPO in July 2012 in London for $520 million.

He is a major investor in American Ethane and serves on its board.

While he was the Minister of Transport of the Russian Federation from May 20, 2004, to 2012, Igor Levitin ensured in 2010 that Mostotrest would construct the toll roads for the Russian federal highway network. According to Finance Magazine (Russian: Журнал «Финанс») in February 2011, Nikolaev as co-owner of the N-Trans holding group was ranked 117 richest Russian with an estimated worth of $920 million which was nearly identical to his business partners Nikita Mishin ranked 116th worth an estimated $920 million and Andrey Filatov ranked 118th worth an estimated $920 million. In 2010, they each had an estimated worth of $690 million according to Finance magazine.

Late in 2011, Nikolaev and Mishin sold to Gennady Timchenko their 13% stake for $150–200 million in Transoil, which is one of the largest railway transporters of oil and oil products in Russia.

In 2014, Nikolaev, Mikhail Yuriev, Andrey Kunatbaev, Roman Abramovich, Alexander Abramov, and Alexander Voloshin became the majority investors in John Houghtaling II's American Ethane. After Roman Abramov divested his investment in American Ethane in April 2017, Nikolaev, Yuriev, and Kunatbaev became co-owners of American Ethane with a combined stake of 88%.

Before October 2014, Nikolaev and his investment partners owned a combined 31.55% stake and Arkady Rotenberg held the other 68.45% stake in Marc O'Polo Investments which held a 38.63% stake in the major road construction firm Mostotrest (Russian: "Мостотрест"), but, in October 2014 after Rotenberg fell under international sanctions because of the Russian interference in Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, Rotenberg transferred his stake to his son Igor. In April 2015, Marc O'Polo investments sold its stake in Mostotrest to NPF Blagosostoyanie (Russian: НПФ "Благосостояние").

Nikolaev, Mishin, and Filatov own 34.5% of Globaltrans (an 11.5% stake for each) but sold the stevedore and ports holding company assets, Global Ports, in December 2017. Sergey Shishkarev's Delo Group purchased the stakes of Nikolaev, Mishin, and Filatov in Global Ports which includes the management of the ports at the First Container Terminal, Petrolesport, Ust-Luga Container Terminal, and the Moby Dick in northwestern Russia; Eastern Stevedoring Company in the Far East; and two in Finland: the Multi-Link Helsinki and the Multi-Link Kotka.

Since 2014 Nikolaev is a major investor in a satellite imagery company ScanEx (Russian: Сканэкс) that supplies classified imagery intelligence to the Russian government which received its license for classified intelligence from the FSB. ScanEx is closely associated with Arkady Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg and his Mostotrest.

Although Nikolaev, as a member of the 13 August 2011 established Right to Arms (Russian: Право на оружие), supports liberalization of arms ownership in Russia in 2011, Vladimir Lisin, who is the head of the Russian Shooting Union (Russian: Российский Стрелковый Союз), opposed Nikolaev.

During the summer of 2013 as an investor, Nikolaev through his managers actively discussed with Alexander Tarasov, who is a representative of the Cyclone Institute and the son of Viktor Tarasov who is the owner of the Cyclone Institute, and the mediator Alexey Beseda, who is the son of Sergey Beseda, about the production of matrices for thermal imagers and "photoelectronic devices". Nikolaev supports the FSB to develop night vision devices for Russian forces in order to avoid sanctions which cripple Russia obtaining the special matrix needed for mini displays and could only be obtained from EU and the United States before the 2014 sanctions against Russia.

In January 2017, Konstantin Nikolaev, his wife Svetlana Nikolaeva and Maria Butina attended the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States.

During Russian war against Ukraine, the Tula Cartridge Plant, which Nikolaev along with Igor Rotenberg are a co-owners since a 2 February 2017 announcement, has supplied very large amounts of ammunition to support Russian forces.

Nikolaev owns the La Madonnina winery in Bolgheri, Tuscany, which he purchased for 4 million euros. Riccardo Cotarella, who is an oenologist, heads the association of Italian winemakers (Italian: *Assoenologi*) and, with his brother Renzo, produces wine under the Familia Cotarella brand, is the manager of both the La Madonnina estate and the cellar for Nikolaev.


## Sanctions

As of July 2023, only Ukraine has Konstantin Nikolaev and Svetlana Nikolaeva under sanctions. No other countries have sanctioned Konstantin Yuryevich Nikolaev, his wife Svetlana Ivanovna Nikolaeva, their son Andrey Konstantinovich Nikolaev or other family members. According to Ilya Yashin (Russian: Илья Яшин), who is an outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin and was incarcerated in Russia for his violations of laws in support of Russia during the Russia-Ukraine War, the family of Konstantin Nikolaev, defense plants in Russia, the NRA, Donald Trump, Trump's gun lobby, Steven Seagal, Maria Butina and others are supporting and financing Russia during its war in Ukraine and have effectively blocked more appropriate sanctions. Ilya Yashin also claims that twenty year deal worth $26 billion between Konstantin Nikolaev's firm American Ethane to supply ethane to China is preventing better sanctions. According to Yashin, Svetlana and Konstantin Nikolaev have met with King Charles III.
