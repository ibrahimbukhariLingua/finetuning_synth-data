## Early life and education

Elting was born in Westchester County, New York, to Everett Elting, an advertising executive, and Judy Elting, an educator. Her family traveled frequently, including long-term residences in Portugal and Canada, where Elting first developed interest in studying languages. In Toronto, a young Elting worked at many jobs over the years including as an usherette for the Toronto Blue Jays. She speaks English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin and earned a BA in Modern Languages and Literatures from Trinity College in 1987, and her MBA from NYU Stern School of Business in 1992.


## Professional career

After graduating from Trinity College, Elting interned in Caracas in the finance department of a cement company and then worked at a language services company in New York City, and interned at Moody’s Investors Service during graduate school. Very briefly after graduation, Elting worked in the proprietary trading division of a French bank; however, she quickly grew dissatisfied with the “boys’ club” atmosphere and the expectation that she would perform administrative and secretarial work alongside her official responsibilities, and left to found her own company.

Having spent several years working in the translation industry, Elting felt there was a need for a service-minded enterprise that could deliver complex projects quickly and accurately. To that end, Elting co-founded TransPerfect in 1992 out of an NYU dorm room. Elting served as co-CEO of TransPerfect for almost 26 years, during which it became the world's largest provider of language and business solutions. Headquartered in New York City, the company has over $600 million in revenues and more than 4,000 employees in over 90 cities around the globe.

During Elting's time as co-CEO, TransPerfect was recognized eight times with the Inc. 5000 Award, six times as one of the Deloitte Technology Fast 500, and earned multiple Stevie Awards, including “Company of the Year” and “Fastest Growing Tech Company of the Year” in 2016. Her tenure also saw Crain's New York Business name TransPerfect one of the largest privately held companies for 12 consecutive years, and one of the largest women-owned companies 11 times. The company was a winner of the 2015 SmartCEO Corporate Culture Awards and was also recognizes by SmartCEO as a “Future 50” company five years running. During her tenure, TransPerfect was also awarded “Best Translation Solution” by the Internet Marketing Association for three consecutive years. It was also named one of the fastest-growing women-owned/led businesses in North America by Entrepreneur and the Women Presidents' Organization.

Elting left TransPerfect in 2018. She currently serves as founder and CEO of the Elizabeth Elting Foundation.


## Corporate divorce

In May 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a decision causing the sale of Elting's 50% ownership of TransPerfect to cofounder Phil Shawe for $385 million, which closed the same month.


## Political views and opinions

Elting, through her regular column at *Forbes*, has articulated a vision of aggressive advancement of women's rights through professional and entrepreneurial development and advancement and women's health. Vocal about women's equality, she strongly advocates for women to act forcefully in the workplace and to own and operate their own businesses, arguing that economic power is social power.

In addition to her work in business, Elting is the founder and CEO of the Elizabeth Elting Foundation, through which she has partnered with the American Heart Association’s Go Red For Women Campaign, where she also serves as co-chair of the New York branch of the movement.
