Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981


# Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981



The **Atomic Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1981** (c. 48) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. The effect of the act was to allow the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, and the secretary of state for energy, to sell, or otherwise dispose of, shares in relevant companies held by them.


## Rationale

The principal aim of the act was to enable the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and the secretary of state for energy to dispose of shares in companies working with radioactive substances. Under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act 1971 the UKAEA's interest in radioactive substances used for medicine was transferred to The Radiochemical Centre (TRC). It was envisaged that TRC would eventually have a private shareholding free from government intervention. Although the UKAEA and secretary of state had powers to buy shares in relevant companies there was no power to dispose of shares. The 1971 act provided for a majority of shares in TRC to be in the public sector, however, the government now thought it expedient that the private holding may have a majority interest. The 1981 act provided for these requirements.
