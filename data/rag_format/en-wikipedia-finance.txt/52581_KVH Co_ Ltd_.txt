## History

After being established by Fidelity Investments in April, 1999, KVH began constructing its own low latency, fiber optic networks in Tokyo and Osaka. Following the dot-com crisis of 2000, KVH was one of the few foreign-owned carriers that continued to invest and do business in Japan.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2001, KVH introduced the first 2.4 Gbit/s leased line Services to Japan and opened its first data center in Osaka. The following year, KVH opened its second data center in Japan and first in Tokyo, KVH Tokyo Data Center 1 (TDC1). TDC1 was the second largest data center in Tokyo and was accompanied by the launch of KVH's ethernet services, voice TDM services, and co-location and data center operational services within the same year.

Since then, KVH has been expanding its portfolio of services as well as its presence across the Asia-Pacific region. Today, KVH's network extends beyond Japan and connects to Chicago, Singapore, and Hong Kong. In February 2011, KVH opened Tokyo Data Center 2 (TDC2), which is located in Inzai City, Chiba. In 2012, KVH (Singapore) Pte Ltd., KVH Services LLC, KVH Hong Kong Ltd., and KVH Korea Ltd. were established. In March 2013, KVH launched Japan’s first 100G metro Ethernet network service. In April 2013, KVH expanded its business further into Asia Pacific and launched two data centers in Hong Kong and Singapore, KVH Hong Kong Data Center 1 (HKDC1) and KVH Singapore Data Center 1 (SGDC1), and a 10-site cloud platform reaching across Europe and Asia.

On November 12, 2014, Colt, a London-based Telecom firm, announced the acquisition of KVH.
