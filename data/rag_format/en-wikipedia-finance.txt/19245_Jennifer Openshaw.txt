Openshaw attended three undergraduate colleges. She graduated from UCLA with a BA and an MBA in finance. She also studied at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, which she attended as a Rotary Scholar. She then attended the UCLA Anderson School of Management, specializing in finance.

As an undergraduate student, Openshaw was named Finance Director of UCLA's Internship Association, where she broke the fundraising record and launched two new businesses—an annual furniture fair (“The Bruin Bear Market”) and a cookbook of politicians’ recipes, which was recognized in the San Jose Mercury News.
