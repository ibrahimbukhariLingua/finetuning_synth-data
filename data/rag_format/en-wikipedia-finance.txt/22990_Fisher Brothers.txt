Fisher Brothers


# Fisher Brothers



**Fisher Brothers** is a real estate firm in New York City. It was formed by Martin Fisher in 1915, and later joined by his brothers Larry (born 1907) and Zachary (born 1910). The Fisher family has substantial real estate holdings in New York City and elsewhere and are considered one of the "royal families" of New York real estate, alongside the Dursts, Roses, Rudins, and Tishmans.


## History

The Fisher family's construction company was founded in 1915 by Martin Fisher. Later, his brothers Larry and Zachary joined to form Fisher Brothers. They built homes in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Riverdale, and Mount Vernon. By the mid-1950s, they had branched out into commercial construction and management. In the 1960s, Fisher Brothers continued to diversify, developing Midtown Manhattan office buildings at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 605 Third Ave., and 299 Park Ave.

Second-generation partners Richard, Anthony, and Arnold Fisher led the firm in the 1980s, brokering deals which included the acquisition of a nine-acre parcel south of the United Nations Headquarters, one of the city's largest available development sites, and the expansion of the Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters in Washington.

The family invested in other businesses including banking and once owned a stake in CBS. The company has been listed in the Fortune 500.

In 2004, Fisher Brothers partnered with Morgan Stanley to form the $770 million City Investment Fund, intended to stimulate investment in Manhattan in the wake of the September 11 attacks.

The firm is currently led by second-generation partner Arnold Fisher as well as third-generation partners Kenneth, Steven, and Winston Fisher.
