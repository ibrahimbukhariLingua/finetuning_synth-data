Commercial Tire


# Commercial Tire



**Commercial Tire** is a chain of tire stores located in the United States, providing tires and related services to owners of passenger, commercial, and agricultural vehicles.


## History

The original store was founded in 1968 by J.R. "Bob" Schwenkfelder, in downtown Boise, Idaho. The store remains active to this day among an ever-growing expansion of stores throughout Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Utah. Their corporate headquarters resides in Meridian, Idaho, and is managed by Bob and his son Trent.

An important factor in the company's success was Bob's acquiring of the Bridgestone tire line in 1969, a time when it was fairly new to the US market and yet to grow popular. Bridgestone is still one of Commercial Tire's featured tire brands, along with Firestone, Cooper, and Yokohama tires.


## Recognition

In 2015, industry news magazine *Modern Tire Dealer* listed Commercial Tire under their Top 100 Independent Tire Dealers and Top 25 Commercial Tire Dealers, ranked #30 and #16 respectively. Bob has also received honorable mention by the *Idaho Business Review* for his work as an influential CEO.
