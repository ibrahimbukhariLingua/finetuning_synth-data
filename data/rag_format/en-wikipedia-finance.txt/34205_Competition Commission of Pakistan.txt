# Competition Commission of Pakistan



The **Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP)** (Urdu: کمپیٹیشن کمیشن آف پاکستان), formerly **Monopoly Control Authority**, is an independent agency quasi-regulatory, quasi-judicial body of the Government of Pakistan for the enforcement of economic competition laws in Pakistan that helps ensure healthy competition. It was created in 2007 by the President of Pakistan through the promulgation of the Competition Ordinance, 2007 replacing Monopoly Control Authority, later Parliament of Pakistan passed Competition Act, 2010 to give legal cover and powers to the commission. The Commission was established to provide for free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity to enhance economic efficiency and to protect consumers from anti competitive behavior.


## History

Prior to the Competition Ordinance, 2007, Pakistan had an anti-monopoly law namely ‘Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (Control and Prevention) Ordinance’ (MRTPO) 1970. The Monopoly Control Authority (MCA) was the organization to administer this Law.
Pakistan decided to update its monopoly law after becoming a member of the World Trade Organisation in 1995, and thereby becoming increasingly aware that if it wanted to avail of the benefits of trade and globalization, it needed a new competition law and policy framework to improve the competitiveness of its domestic markets. To this end, Pakistan approached the World Bank for technical assistance, and in 2006, a team led by World Bank experts commenced discussions with Pakistani officials, economists and lawyers, to develop the parameters of such a law and policy. In 2007, the World Bank team submitted its report to the Pakistani government and with it, a draft law was prepared by them.
The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) was established on 2 October 2007 under the Competition Ordinance, 2007, which was repromulgated in November 2009. The law was later promulgated as Competition Act, 2010.
The Competition Act, 2010 is based on international best practices, considers the current economic realities, and corrects the deficiencies of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Ordinance (MRTPO) of 1970 related to definitional aspects, coverage, penalties, and other procedural matters. It covers all sectors of the economy, regardless of their public or private ownership.


## Workings

The Competition Act, 2010, prohibits undertakings from abusing a dominant position in the market, participating in anti-competitive agreements, and resorting to deceptive marketing practices that could result in a transaction based on incorrect or inaccurate information. It also reviews mergers between undertakings that could result in significant impediments to effective competition. Through advocacy, the Commission encourages voluntary compliance and promotes a ‘competition culture’ to take root in the economy. Anti-competitive business conduct can have harmful effects on the level of competition in the economy and thus, on consumers.

The Competition Commission of Pakistan under Competition Act, 2010 principally deals with

* Abuse of Dominant Position (Section 3)
* Prohibited Agreements (Section 4)
 + Section 4 is divided into three sub-sections:
 - Section 4(1) states that a practice may be anticompetitive if it has the object or effect restricting competition
 - Section 4(2) provides a non-exhaustive list of the types of agreements that are prohibited under section 4(1)
 - Section 4(3) declares that any agreement contrary to section 4(1) shall be void.
* Deceptive Marketing Practices (Section 10)
* Approval of Mergers (Section 11)
* Exceptions (Section 5 to 9)
 + Section 5 of the Act allows parties to obtain exemptions for their agreements if they are able to establish their pro-competitive effects in terms of section 9.
