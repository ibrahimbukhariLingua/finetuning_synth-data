Molsons Bank


# Molsons Bank



The **Molsons Bank** was a Canadian bank founded in Montreal, Quebec, by brothers William (1793–1875) and John Molson, Jr. (1787–1860), the sons of brewery magnate John Molson.


## Operations

In 1837, the bank opened and issued its first banknotes. In 1850, it was constituted under the *Free Banking Act* passed by the parliament of the Province of Canada. To increase its powers and its revenue, the bank was incorporated in 1855. It was granted a charter on May 19, 1855 in Montreal allowing it to operate its bank in the same way as other banks. With its head office at the corner of St. James & St. Peter streets (today known as Saint-Jacques and Saint-Pierre streets) in Montreal, it continued in operation until 1925 when it merged with the Bank of Montreal.


## Branches

The bank operated 125 branches primarily in Quebec and Ontario. It also had branches in western Canada and agents in the US and UK.

The Bank of Montreal at 3 King Street South, Waterloo, Ontario, is a former branch of the Molson Bank that was built in 1914 and is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.
