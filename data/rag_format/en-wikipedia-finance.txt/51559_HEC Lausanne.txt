## History

In 1537, the Academy of Lausanne was founded as a school of theology. In 1890, the Academy of Lausanne received the status of a University; economics was taught within the Faculty of Law. This period was strongly influenced by Léon Walras (1834–1910), the founder of the Lausanne School and creator of the general equilibrium theory. It was also the time of Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923), the famous author of the concept of Pareto efficiency.

On April 15, 1911, the "Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales" (HEC) was founded by Léon Morf and Georges Paillard within the Faculty of Law. The same year, the school welcomed its 12 first students. Léon Morf, professor of management tools, public accounting, and financial mathematics was its first dean, followed by Georges Paillard.ᵖᵉʳᵐᵃⁿᵉⁿᵗ ᵈᵉᵃᵈ ˡⁱⁿᵏ
