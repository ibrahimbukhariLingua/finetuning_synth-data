The remaining branches (most of them) were sold to Grupo Chedraui, except for the Valle Oriente branch in Monterrey, Nuevo León, which was transferred to Walmart, due to Chedraui's reluctance and refusal to invest in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey, despite having a distribution center in its northern area.
