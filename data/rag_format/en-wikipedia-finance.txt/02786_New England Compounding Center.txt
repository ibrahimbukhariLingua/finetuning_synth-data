## Ameridose

Ameridose was established to be a large manufacturer of prescription medications for use in hospitals. The original location of the company's plant was in Framingham, Massachusetts next to its sister-companies New England Compounding Center and Medical Sales Management. In 2009, they purchased and started operations at two new locations, 205 and 203 Flanders Road in nearby Westborough, Massachusetts, to accommodate the steady growth of the company. Ameridose would eventually employ over 1,000 people and report annual revenues of 300 million.


## NECC 2012 outbreak

The company became the center of national headlines resulting from a meningitis outbreak that started in September, 2012. NECC recalled more than 2,000 products after distributing 17,000 vials of methylprednisolone for injection contaminated with fungi to 23 states.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations dictate that compounding pharmacies like NECC combine, mix, or alter ingredients only to create specific drugs for individual patients. Massachusetts state regulators reported NECC was licensed only to prepare individual patient prescriptions. Doctors, hospitals, and clinics had turned to compounding pharmacies like NECC because they often charge much lower prices than the major manufacturers.

On December 21, 2012, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing less than $2.34 million in debts. Following the bankruptcy, a *Reuters* investigation into financial filings revealed company payments exceeding $33 million to the top executives and private equity investors in 2012. Additionally, The Tennessean reported that between 2007 and 2013, majority shareholders Carla and Doug Conigliaro received a total of $120 million from NECC and its sister company, Ameridose.
