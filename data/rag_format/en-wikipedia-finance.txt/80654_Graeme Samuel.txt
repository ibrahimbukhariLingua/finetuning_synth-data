* The AFL is being damaged by maintaining 11 clubs in Victoria
* Fitzroy should consider merging with Brisbane
* Commission should no longer deal with issues of discipline
* Waverley Park's future will depend on how many clubs are in the competition
* A minimum salary cap should be considered for clubs
* Western Oval is not necessarily the best place for Footscray
* Minimum level of contribution to AFL revenue a condition of clubs keeping license

Samuel was also the chairman of the Melbourne and Olympic Parks Trust, which oversees both Melbourne Park and Olympic Park.
