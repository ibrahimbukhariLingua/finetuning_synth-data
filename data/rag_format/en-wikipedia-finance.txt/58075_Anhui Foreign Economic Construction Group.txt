# Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group



**Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group** (AFECC) is a Chinese construction and mining company with an international focus that includes 14 overseas subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and Pacific Islands. Based on the value of 2011 deals, the company ranks among the top 225 contractors in terms of international projects.

In its charitable giving, the company contributed $1.5 million towards a week long phase of a medical mission called the "Brightness Trip", in which a medical team visiting the hospitals of Malawi treated patients with cataract conditions.

Due to a high debt burden, the company defaulted on RMB 6.7 billion in bonds in June 2019. Chinese regulators were slow to recognize the risk, rating the company's bonds AA+ a month before the default.

In 2016, Robert Mugabe accused Anjin out stealing the country's diamonds and ordered all diamond mining to cease. By 2020, Anjin reportedly returned to the country, but there were no reports of Anjin's diamond production from Zimbabwe's Chamber of Mines.
