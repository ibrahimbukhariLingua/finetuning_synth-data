## Operations

IndiGo became one of the fastest growing low-cost carriers in the world and the largest airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single type of aircraft (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus, reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as baggage handlers. In July 2023, Indian aviation watchdog Directorate General of Civil Aviation imposed a ₹30 lakh (US$35,000) fine on IndiGo for certain systemic deficiencies concerning documentation pertaining to operations, training, and engineering procedures.
