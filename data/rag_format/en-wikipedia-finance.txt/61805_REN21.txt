REN21


# REN21



**REN21** (**Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century**) is a policy network and a multistakeholder governance group which is focused on renewable energy policy.

REN21's goal is to facilitate policy development, knowledge exchange, and joint action towards a rapid global transition to renewable energy. REN21 brings together governments, non-governmental organisations, research and academic institutions, international organisations, and industry to learn from one another and advance the adoption of renewable energy.

To assist policy decision-making, REN21 provides knowledge about what is happening now in the renewable energy sector and how the latest trends will impact future developments. REN21 facilitates the collection of information on renewable energy. It does this through six products: the *Renewables Global Status Report* (GSR), regional status reports, global futures reports (GFR), thematic reports, the REN21 Renewables Academy, and the International Renewable Energy Conference (IREC) series.

The REN21 Secretariat is based in Paris, France, and is a registered non-profit association under German law (e.V.). The organisation has more than 100 member organisations as of 2024 and over 4000 active community members.
