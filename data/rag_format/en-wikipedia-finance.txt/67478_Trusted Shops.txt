# Trusted Shops



**Trusted Shops** is a company founded in Cologne, Germany in 1999, which offers online shops and their customers trust-building services by means of a trustmark, a money-back guarantee process and a system of customer reviews.

## Company history


### Foundation

The company was founded in Cologne (Germany) in 1999 as a joint venture between *Gerling Speziale Kreditversicherungs AG* and the business consultancy *Impact Business & Technology Consulting GmbH*. Jean-Marc Noël and Ulrich Hafenbradl were among the founders. The company began operations one year later. Its offer consisted of a trustmark for online shops, and from the very beginning the company also offered customers of online shops displaying the trustmark a money-back guarantee. By mid-November 2000, around 100 shops had obtained the trustmark.
