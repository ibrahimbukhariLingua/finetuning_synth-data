## History

A process for separating magnesite from talc in talc ore was developed in Finland in the 1960s; the company Suomen Talkki Oy was founded in 1967 to commercialise this invention. Following several production expansions and developments such as rotogravure paper coating talc, Mondo Minerals was established as a joint venture between Omya AG and Western Mining Ltd in 1998. This joint venture included the former Finnminerals Oy, Westmin BV Amsterdam and the talc business of Norwegian Talc AS. Ownership of Mondo Minerals was transferred to Omya AG in 2001. In 2007, Mondo Minerals was acquired by Hg Capital. The company received patents for highly delaminated talc and for talc use in beverage filtration the following year. Recent developments include the first commercial paint talc slurry production, the introduction of compacted talc for the plastics industry, the launch of talc for pharmaceuticals, and a patented exfoliant in personal care formulations.
In July 2011, Mondo Minerals has been acquired by Advent International. In October 2018, Elementis, a global specialty chemicals company, has closed the acquisition of Mondo Minerals from Advent International.
