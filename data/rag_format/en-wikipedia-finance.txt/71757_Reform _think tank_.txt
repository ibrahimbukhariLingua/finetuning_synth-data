## Name of trust

The Trust was originally named "The Reform Research Trust" however it sometimes refers to itself as the abbreviated "Reform" such as the website www.reform.uk which has led to some disputes regarding the name.

In November 2020 the trust voiced its opposition to the electoral committee when the Brexit Party, a British political party, intended to change its name to Reform UK. The charity feared that its non-partisan status would be brought into disrepute by the name change, and requested for the party to come up with an alternative. In January 2021, the Electoral Commission approved of the Brexit Party's name change to Reform UK.


## Funding

In November 2022 Reform was given a 'B' grade for funding transparency by Who Funds You?, meaning that they named at least 85% of donors that provided more than £5,000 of funding.
