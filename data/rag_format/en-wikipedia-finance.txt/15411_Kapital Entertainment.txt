Kapital Entertainment


# Kapital Entertainment



**Kapital Entertainment** is an American entertainment company founded by Aaron Kaplan in 2009. Prior to founding Kapital, Kaplan was the worldwide head of scripted television at William Morris Agency, which he joined in 1991. He exited the company in 2009 when WMA was going through the regulatory process to finalize their merger with Endeavor to form WME Entertainment.

Kapital has since produced shows for many different networks such as CBS, Netflix, Amazon, Showtime, MTV, ABC, NBC, Fox, and HBO. Some of the company's productions including, *Terra Nova*, *Life in Pieces*, *The Mysteries of Laura*, *American Housewife*, *The Chi*, *Fam*, and *Santa Clarita Diet*.

Kapital also has two pod deals, one in 2014 with development executive Tracy Katsky via KatCo, which produces *Santa Clarita Diet* and another in 2016 with former longtime head of comedy at CBS Wendi Trilling to launch TrillTV. Both pods are based at Kapital's offices in West Hollywood.

On February 10, 2017, Kapital formed a joint venture with CBS Corporation and acquired a 50% ownership stake. CBS will also provide Co-financing for Kapital projects and will serve as worldwide distributor. However, Kapital will continue to operate as it had previously as an independent production company that is completely separate from CBS Television Studios (later CBS Studios) and CBS Television Network and it will have no first-look or any other agreements with either of them. In 2019, CBS Corporation merged with Viacom to form ViacomCBS, now Paramount Global.
