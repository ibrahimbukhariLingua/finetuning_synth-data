# Housing Affairs Letter



***Housing Affairs Letter*** is a news service (or newsletter) produced in Silver Spring, MD by CD Publications that covers the public, private and subsidized housing industries. It is one of the oldest continuing publications of its kind.


## History

*Housing Affairs Letter* was the first newsletter produced by CD Publications upon its founding in 1961. It began publication four years before the creation of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and a significant percentage of its coverage since then has focused on HUD.

Over the years, *HAL* articles have been reprinted, referenced, quoted or mentioned in numerous periodicals and journals, including *The Washington Post*, the *National Review*, *The Journal of Housing*, and the *Journal of Urban Law*.

*HAL* has been mentioned in or used as a reference for many books, including:

Additionally, HAL has appeared in Congressional reports, in documents of city planning and development committees, and in multiple publications of such housing organizations as the Fannie Mae Foundation. In 2007, *HAL* appeared as "suggested additional reading" on Dr. Sammis B. White's syllabus for a class entitled "Housing Markets and Public Policy." It was mentioned alongside such respected national publications as *Fortune*, *Forbes* and the *Wall Street Journal*.
