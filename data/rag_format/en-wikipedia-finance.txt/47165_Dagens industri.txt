***Dagens industri*** (**Di**) is a financial newspaper in tabloid format published in Stockholm, Sweden.


## History and profile

*Dagens industri* was founded in 1976 with two issues per week. In 1983 it increased its periodicity to five issues per week and to six in 1990. It has since started affiliate newspapers in Austria, Estonia (Äripäev), Latvia (Dienas Bizness [lv]), Lithuania (Verslo žinios), Poland (Puls Biznesu), Russia (Delovoy Peterburg), Scotland and Slovenia (Poslovni dnevnik Finance). *Dagens Industri* is owned by the Swedish family-owned media group Bonnier AB and is published in tabloid format.

The stated position of the editorial page is independent liberal-conservative. The newspaper's online edition, *di.se*, has been voted as Sweden's "best economics online site" 20 years in a row between 1999 and 2019, in a competition held by the PR-firm Hallvarsson & Halvarsson.

In January 2016, former Managing Editor Lotta Edling succeeded Peter Fellman as the editor-in-chief of *Dagens industri*. Fellman returned as editor-in-chief in August 2018.

In 2022 the paper received criticism for its marketing methods by the Swedish consumer agency. Consumers have been targeted by affordable offers, which have later on changed into more expensive 12-month subscriptions without their approval or knowledge.
