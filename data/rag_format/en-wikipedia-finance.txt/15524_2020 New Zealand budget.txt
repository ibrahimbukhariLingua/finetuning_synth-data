2020 New Zealand budget


# 2020 New Zealand budget



**Budget 2020**, dubbed "**Rebuilding Together**", was the New Zealand budget for fiscal year 2020/21 worth NZ$50 billion, presented to the House of Representatives by Finance Minister Grant Robertson on 14 May 2020, the third budget presented by the coalition government of 2017–2020. This budget occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand and on the same day that the country exited the lockdown brought about by alert level 3.


## Background

The 2020 budget was released in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which spread to New Zealand in late February 2020.
In response to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the country entered into a nationwide lockdown on the evening of 25 March, in which all non-essential businesses were closed.
Because of the closure of businesses, the government offered a $12.1 billion wage subsidy scheme to offset employment costs in an attempt to keep as many New Zealanders as possible in their jobs.

The original contents of the budget were set aside and replaced with a plan on how New Zealand will recover from the lasting effects of COVID-19, of which this budget is only the first step. Finance Minister Grant Robertson states that the economic recovery for New Zealand will create an extended operating deficit and increase debt to above previous targets, however he points out that New Zealand entered the COVID-19 crisis with a debt of below 20% of GDP compared to the United States with 90% and the United Kingdom with above 75%. The budget expands on the $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme infrastructure project.


## Major announcements

The 2020 budget included the allocation of NZ$50 billion to the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which would be spent on several areas including a $3.2 billion wage subsidy scheme, business support, trades training support, a $1.1 billion environmental jobs package, $900 million to support Māori, housing, and extending the school lunch programme. $15.9 billion would be spend on rejuvenating the economy while $20.2 billion would be put aside for future investment.
