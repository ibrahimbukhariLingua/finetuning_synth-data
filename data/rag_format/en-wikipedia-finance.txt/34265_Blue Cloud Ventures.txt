# Blue Cloud Ventures



**Blue Cloud Ventures** is a New York-based venture capital fund specializing in software-as-a-service, infrastructure, and open source software companies. The fund focuses primarily on growth stage companies with annual revenue between $10 and $50 million that are expected to reach an exit within three - five years. Blue Cloud is noted for offering a relatively high degree of flexibility with regards to financing terms, including the exit timeline, board representation, and the amount of funding.


## Founding and Partnering

Blue Cloud was founded by Rami Rahal, Mir Arif and Joel Lou in 2012. Both Rahal and Arif were working at Madison Park Group, a New York investment bank, which Arif was leading when Rahal, then 25 years old, proposed the idea to him.
