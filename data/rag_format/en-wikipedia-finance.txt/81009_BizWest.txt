***BizWest*** is a print and electronic business paper in Northern Colorado.


## History

In 2010, Brown Publishing Company, the owner of the newspapers *Boulder County Business Report* and *Northern Colorado Business Report* declared bankruptcy and, in September, sold them to Ohio Community Media. In February 2011, the publishers of the two papers formed BizWest Media to acquire their publications, the *Wyoming Business Report*, and ancillary other assets from Ohio Community Media. In March 2014, the *Boulder County Business Report* and *Northern Colorado Business Report* were merged into a biweekly printed paper called *BizWest*, with initial circulation of 9,000 to cover Boulder, Broomfield, Larimer and Weld counties, as well as the Denver-Boulder corridor.

In September 2016, *BizWest* reduced its print publication frequency to monthly and laid off four of its eighteen staff, including one writer. The company cited subscribers shifting to digital-only subscriptions and management's desire to focus on growth areas of the business as reasons for the changes.
