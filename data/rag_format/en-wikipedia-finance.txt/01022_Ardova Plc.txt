## Acquisition

Energy mogul Femi Otedola was awarded $19 million in an arbitration case regarding the share purchase agreement (SPA) relating to the acquisition of Forte Oil, now Ardova Plc.

The agreement was reached in response to a decision made by the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) in October, which mandated that Ignite Investments and Commodities Limited, Chairman Abdulwasiu Sowami of Ardova's special purpose acquisition company, make SPA payments less the sum granted for one of Zenon Petroleum's claims.

Later, the business would argue that Zenon Petroleum had infringed on its warranty with regard to the SPA, which prompted Ignite Investments to file a lawsuit in which it asserted claims against Zenon.

In order to acquire their 25.9% holding (970.7 million shares) and take Ardova private, Mr. Sowami offered minority shareholders N17.38 per share, or N16.9 billion, in February.
