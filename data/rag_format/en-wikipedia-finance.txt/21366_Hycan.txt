# Hycan



**Hycan Automobile Technology** (Chinese: 合创汽车科技有限公司) is a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer headquartered in Guangzhou, China.


## History

On 10 April 2018, GAC Group, GAC New Energy Technology (now GAC Aion) and Nio Inc. established a joint venture called GAC-Nio New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and almost a year later, on 1 April 2019, GAC and Nio announced the upcoming revealing of a new brand Hycan and electric SUV under this joint venture.

In early 2021, Guangdong Pearl River Investment Management Group has become GAC-Nio's largest shareholder, while Nio's stake in Hycan was diluted to 4.5%. Later that year, GAC-Nio changed its name to Hycan. In 2022, Nio withdrew as a shareholder of Hycan.

On January 11, 2025, GAC Group disclosed that as the shareholder, it is solving the employee placement issue of Hycan in accordance with its investment ratio. GAC Aion will take over the after-sales service of Hycan products. Hycan has been confirmed as substantially defunct.
