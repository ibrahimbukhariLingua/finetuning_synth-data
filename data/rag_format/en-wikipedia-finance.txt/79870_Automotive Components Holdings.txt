Automotive Components Holdings


# Automotive Components Holdings



**Automotive Components Holdings, LLC** (informally **ACH**) is a Ford Motor Company-managed temporary business formed by the 2005 transfer of 17 automotive components factories and six research, testing and other facilities from Visteon Corporation to Ford. The creation of ACH was intended to ensure that Ford continued to receive a flow of parts from the facilities, whilst enabling them to be prepared for sale or other disposition.

ACH is headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, United States.


## History

ACH was established by Ford Motor Company as a temporary business structure to hold and manage 17 automotive components factories and six research, testing and other facilities acquired from Visteon on October 1, 2005. The plants were acquired by Ford primarily to ensure that its operations were not affected by parts-supply disruptions or Visteon's ability to invest in future programs whilst Visteon was experiencing a period of severe financial challenge.

Two plants â€“ Converca (power transfer units) and El Jarudo (fuel rails) - were sold in 2007. The driveshaft business based at the Monroe Plant was sold to Neapco Drivelines, LLC in January 2008, and its equipment and employees were moved to another location in southeast Michigan. On April 14, 2008 the ACH glass business, including three plants (Nashville, Tulsa and Vidriocar) and the Carlite glass distribution facility, were sold to Zeledyne Glass Products, a company specifically formed to acquire all of the former glass operations of ACH and run them as an independent company. Three facilities - Utica (idled), Monroe (idled), Ypsilanti (idled) - were sold in 2009 and 2010.
