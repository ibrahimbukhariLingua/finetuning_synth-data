In 1972, Friedlaender became a visiting professor at the MIT Department of Economics. In 1974, she was a professor at MIT's Department of Economics and Civil Engineering.

## Contribution

Friedlaender was a scholar who published many professional and academic articles, influential books, and several monographs. One of the most well-known publications she wrote was *The Interstate Highway System*, which quickly made her an authority in the field of transportation economics at the age of 27.

Her later works on the public finance and regulations of the public transportation system became fundamentals in these fields, and her analysis was considered in future regulation and policymaking. Her use of econometric modelling on the transport system was innovative for its time.

Friedlaender's work with Spady, *Transport Regulation: Equity, Efficiency, and Competition in the Rail and Trucking Industries,* raised a lot of attention along with significant policy implications. Also, Friedlaender was very invested in improving learning materials for students. Friedlaender joined John F. Due as the second author and edited the fifth and later editions of *Government Finance: Economics of the Public Sector* in 1973, helping to improve the classic textbook published in seven editions from 1954 to 1981. The then provost, Professor John M. Deutch, described her as "one of the best deans to have graced MIT in its history," adding, "She is a person of enormous wisdom and her accomplishments for the school have been just as enormous."

Aside from being productive in the academic field, Friedlaender was a member of the American Economic Association and the chair of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. There, she actively provided help and was committed to inspiring more women to choose academic careers and attend graduate school.
