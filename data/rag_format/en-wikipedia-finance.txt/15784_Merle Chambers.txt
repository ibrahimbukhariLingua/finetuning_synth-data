## Early life and education

Chambers was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Jerry G. Chambers and Evelyn Hemmings Chambers. She graduated from the North Shore Country Day School in Winnetka in 1964.

She earned her B.A. in political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, where she was a student protester in free speech and civil rights demonstrations. She earned her J.D. at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law and her M.A. in tax law at the University of Denver.


## Career

Chambers worked as an attorney in San Francisco before moving to Denver in 1977; she began working as an attorney in private practice in the latter city in 1978. In 1980 she founded and became chief executive officer of Axem Resources, a private oil and gas exploration and production firm, which she oversaw for 17 years until selling the company in 1997. Since 1997 she has been president and CEO of Leith Ventures, a private investment firm.


## Philanthropy

In 1997 she established the Chambers Family Fund (renamed the Merle Chambers Fund). This private foundation supports social justice and equity, and women's economic security. Historically, the foundation also supported early education. The fund established women's foundations in Wyoming and Montana in 1999 and in Oklahoma in 2003. Chambers was a significant donor for the establishment of the Merle Catherine Chambers Center for the Advancement of Women at the University of Denver. The foundation has supported various arts and culture organizations in Colorado, including the Denver Art Museum, which features the Merle Chambers and Hugh Grant Modern Gallery; the Colorado Ballet; the Ellie Caulkins Opera House at the Denver Performing Arts Complex, to which the fund gave $2 million to Denver Arts & Venues toward the opening of the Chambers Grant Salon; the Clyfford Still Museum; and Kirkland Museum of Fine & Decorative Art.

In 2020, Merle Chambers launched Chambers Initiative, with an objective to empower systemic, sustainable change to create a more fair and just society. Both Merle Chambers and Merle Chambers Fund are part of this broader philanthropic endeavor fueled by a heightened commitment in the areas of social justice and women's economic security. The goal of Chambers Initiative is to ensure that more people - particularly those most impacted by economic, social, and political injustice - have a good chance to reach their full potential.


### Political contributor

Chambers is an active contributor to state and national political campaigns. During the 1992 United States presidential election, she and Swanee Hunt hosted a $1,000-per-person fund-raising event called "Serious Women, Serious Issues, Serious Money". They chose to feature the Democratic candidates' wives, Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore, rather than the male candidates themselves. While setting a fundraising goal of $1 million, they also invited 300 women whom they knew could not contribute large sums but who could participate in the exchange of ideas. According to *Mother Jones*, Chambers contributed $210,000 in soft money donations to the Democratic Party in 1992. In 2015 Chambers and her (then) husband Hugh A. Grant co-hosted one fundraiser to benefit Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

A 2014, a *Rocky Mountain News* report identified Chambers as one of Colorado's top 10 political contributors between 2011 and 2013, with $430,260 in contributions. The report noted that "[m]any of Chambers' contributions focus on Democratic female leadership, including Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota".

During the 2024 elections, Chambers donated $200,000 to support Colorado Amendment 79, a measure to ensure abortion access in the state.
