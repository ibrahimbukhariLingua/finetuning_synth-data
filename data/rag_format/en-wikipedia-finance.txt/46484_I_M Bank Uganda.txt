## History

The bank was founded in 1993 by a group of business people who were related by blood and marriage.

In 1996, the bank opened its second branch in the city of Jinja, about one hour's drive east of the capital Kampala. In 2002, the bank acquired Trans-Africa Bank Limited, which had been declared insolvent by the BOU.

Following a spate of Ugandan bank failures in the 1990s and early 2000s, the banking laws in Uganda were changed to bar family members from jointly owning more than 49 per cent in the same financial institution. Orient Bank was given a grace period to find a suitable investor.

In April 2009, Bank PHB Group, a Nigerian financial services group, acquired 80 per cent shareholding in Orient Bank for a cash payment of US$62 million. In August 2011, the group was itself declared insolvent by the Central Bank of Nigeria, and its assets and some liabilities were acquired by Keystone Bank Limited, which was owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.

In July 2014, international media reported that Keystone Bank planned to divest from Orient Bank. In February 2015, Keystone Bank divested from Orient Bank by selling 42 per cent shareholding to the private equity firm 8 Miles Fund, whose shareholders include the celebrity and activist Bob Geldof. The remaining 38 per cent was sold to three individuals, namely Ketan Morjaria; one of the founders of the bank, Alemayehu Fisseha, and Zhong Shuang Quan.
