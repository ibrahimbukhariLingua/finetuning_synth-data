## Sanctions

On 17 April 2019, the United States Treasury Department sanctioned and issued Office of Foreign Assets Control designations against the Central Bank of Venezuela and Iliana Ruzza to prevent it from being used "as a tool of the Maduro regime, which continues to plunder Venezuelan assets and exploit government institutions to enrich" corrupt officials. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that while the designation disqualifies most of the Central Bank actions taken by the Maduro administration, the United States has taken steps to ensure that debit and credit card transactions could proceed, and that both personal remittances and humanitarian assistance remained intact and could help those suffering "under the repression of the Maduro regime".
