## History

The **Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce and Tourism** was a member of the Oklahoma Governor's Cabinet.

The second and last Secretary was Dave Lopez, who was appointed by Governor Mary Fallin on January 27, 2011.

The position of Secretary of Commerce and Tourism was established in 2003 when Governor Brad Henry issued an executive order merging the former positions of **Secretary of Commerce** and **Secretary of Tourism and Recreation** into a single position. Previously, both positions had existed since 1986 when they were established by the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986.

On July 16, 2013, Governor Mary Fallin announced the re-creation of the Secretary of Tourism position and restored the original title of Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce as a result.
