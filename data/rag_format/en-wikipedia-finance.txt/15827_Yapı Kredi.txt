## History

Yapı Kredi was acquired by Mehmet Emin Karamehmet's Çukurova Holding in 1984, and Hüsnü Özyeğin was its general manager until 1987. In 2003, Çukurova Holding reached an agreement with the Turkish bank regulator to sell the majority of its shares in Yapı Kredi within two years. In 2005, the majority of shares in Yapı Kredi were acquired by the owners of Koçbank. Koç Finansal Hizmetler (KFH; Koç Financial Services, KFS), was an equal partnership between Koç Holding and Italian banking giant UniCredit. In 2006, Koçbank was merged into Yapı Kredi, leaving 80% of Yapı Kredi owned by KFS. In November 2019 Unicredit exited the joint venture KFS which controls the bank and acquired a smaller stake in the company. In 2024 it expanded to Germany.
