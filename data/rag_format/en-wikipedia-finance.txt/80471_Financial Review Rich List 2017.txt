Financial Review Rich List 2017


# Financial Review Rich List 2017



The ***Financial Review* Rich List 2017** is the 34th annual survey of the wealthiest people resident in Australia, published by *The Australian Financial Review* on 25 May 2017. From its establishment in 1984 and up until the publication of the 2016 list, the survey had been published in either hardcopy and/or online format in the *BRW*, or formerly, the *Business Review Weekly*. On 4 March 2016, Fairfax Media announced the closure of the *BRW* website, and redirected the site to a new section of *The Australian Financial Review*. Rich lists are now published in *The Australian Financial Review Magazine* and in 2017 were rebranded as the *Financial Review Rich List*.

In the 2017 list, the net worth of the wealthiest individual, Anthony Pratt, was A$12.60 billion. The combined wealth of the 200 individuals was calculated as A$230 billion; compared with a combined wealth of A$6.4 billion in 1984 when the *BRW* Rich 200 commenced. Fifteen women and 185 men made the 2014 list.
