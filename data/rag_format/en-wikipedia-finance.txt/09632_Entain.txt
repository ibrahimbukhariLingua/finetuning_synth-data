# Entain



**Entain plc**, formerly **GVC Holdings**, is an international sports betting and gambling company. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It owns brands such as bwin, Coral, Ladbrokes, PartyPoker and Sportingbet.


## History

The company was incorporated in Luxembourg in 2004 as Gaming VC Holdings. It was founded by a group of four American businesspersons, led by Steve Barlow, as a vehicle to acquire Casino-Club, an online casino established in 2001 that was reportedly the largest online gambling operator in German-speaking countries. The company made its initial public offering on the AIM exchange on 21 December 2004, raising funds that were used to complete the €105-million acquisition of Casino-Club on the same day.

In 2010, Gaming VC was reorganised in the Isle of Man as GVC Holdings.

In 2012, GVC and William Hill bought Sportingbet, with William Hill taking the Australian and Spanish markets, and GVC taking the rest of the world.

GVC acquired Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment in 2016 for £1.1 billion after a bidding battle with rival gambling group 888 Holdings, leading to a marked recovery in GVC's financial situation. After the acquisition, Bwin.Party returned to growth after many years of falling sales.

In December 2017, GVC agreed to buy Ladbrokes Coral in a deal which could be worth up to £4 billion. The acquisition was completed in March 2018.

In mid-2018 a shareholder rebellion forced out GVC director, Peter Isola, after reports showed that two executives at the company earned a disproportionate £67 million in salary.

In July 2018, GVC agreed to a $200-million deal with MGM Resorts International to capitalise on the newly liberalised US sports betting market.

In 2019, GVC chairman Lee Feldman left the company. While Feldman was overdue to leave under UK corporate governance code that recommends chairs of listed companies not stay in position longer than nine years, the news came two weeks after Feldman sold £6m worth of his GVC shares and CEO Kenny Alexander sold shares worth £13.7m, which led to GVC's share price falling nearly 14% in a single day. Barry Gibson took over as Chairman upon Feldman's departure.

In July 2020, Shay Segev, GVC's chief operating officer (COO), succeeded Alexander as CEO following his "surprise departure" after 13 years in charge. The same month, the UK tax authority HM Revenue and Customs announced that it was widening the scope of its investigation into “potential corporate offending” related to GVC's former Turkish-facing online gambling business, which it had sold in December 2017. GVC dismissed public reports that the HMRC probe was related to insolvent payment processor Wirecard, saying there was “no evidence of any link between the HMRC investigation and the payment service providers mentioned in the newspaper report.”

In December 2020, GVC Holdings changed its name to Entain plc. The rebranding was said to reflect a "new era of sustainability and conduct", which also included a commitment to operate only in regulated markets by 2023.

In 2021, Entain's joint venture partner MGM Resorts made an offer to buy Entain, valuing the business at $11 billion. The board and Segev rejected the offer saying, that it "significantly undervalues the company and its prospects". MGM Resorts subsequently withdrew the offer.

In January 2021, Segev stepped down as Entain CEO and was succeeded by Jette Nygaard-Andersen, who became the first woman to lead a UK-listed gambling company.

In August 2021, Entain acquired US-based esports betting company Unikrn for £50 million.

In November 2021, it was reported that Entain had sold the Betdaq business, which had been acquired by Ladbrokes eight years earlier, back to its original founder Dermot Desmond. The sale price was reportedly substantially less than £25 million the company was originally acquired for. Also in November 2021, Entain sold its InterTrader business to Raven Ventures International.

In February 2022, Entain acquired the Canadian sports betting operator Sports Interaction from Avid Gaming for £175 million.

In November 2022, Entain acquired the Croatian sports betting company, SuperSport.

In January 2023, Entain acquired the Dutch online gambling company, BetCity, from Sports Entertainment Media for £398 million.

In March 2023, Entain acquired the New Zealand based esports betting developer Sportsflare for CA$13.2m.

In December 2023, Nygaard-Andersen stepped down as Entain CEO and was succeeded on an interim basis by Stella David, a non-executive director of Entain. Nygaard-Andersen had been criticised by shareholders in relation to the company's poor business performance.

On 29 February 2024, Entain, announced its decision to withdraw from Responsible Wagering Australia, coinciding with the Australian government's preparations to implement stricter betting advertisement restrictions.

In April 2024, Entain announced that its interim CEO, Stella David, would succeed Barry Gibson as chairman, following Gibson's retirement in September.

In July 2024, Entain Plc appointed Gavin Isaacs as CEO, replacing interim CEO Stella David. Isaacs will start as CEO on 2 September 2024.
In December 2024, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), took legal action against Entain, for failing to meet anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) requirements. The regulator accused Entain of inadequate checks on high-risk customers, including using pseudonyms to obscure identities. Isaacs warned of significant fines and said the company was cooperating fully while improving its compliance measures.
