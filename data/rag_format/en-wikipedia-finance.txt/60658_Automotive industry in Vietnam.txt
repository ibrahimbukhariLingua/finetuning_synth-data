Automotive industry in Vietnam


# Automotive industry in Vietnam



The **automotive industry in Vietnam** is a fast-growing sector mainly reliant on domestic sales. All currently produced models are designed abroad by foreign brands, and many rely on knock-down kit production. Due to high import taxes on automobiles, the Vietnamese government protects domestic manufacturing. Although Vietnam is a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, automobile imports fall under an exception. Since January 1, 2018, the 30% import tax has been discontinued as part of ASEAN agreements. Currently,ʷʰᵉⁿ? the Vietnamese motor industry is not deemed competitive enough to make exports feasible.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ As of April 2018, 85% of car sales in Vietnam were produced domestically from knock-down kits.

Before Đổi Mới, automobile ownership in Vietnam was limited, and the vehicles present were imported from Second World countries that were more politically aligned with the government. In 1995, the first automobile factories were built, using knock-down kits to produce vehicles, starting with Mitsubishi, Toyota, and Isuzu. Between 2003 and 2006, the automobile sales tax increased from 5% to 50%, slowing down car sales.

The Vietnamese car market is relatively small, albeit the fastest growing in Southeast Asia.

Most automobile manufacturers in Vietnam are members of the (non-governmental) Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers' Association (VAMA).


## Auto parts

Vietnam has a US$900 million trade surplus in car parts, totaling US$4.4 billion of car part exports. Most of this production is by foreign owned businesses operating in Vietnam. In total the number of parts suppliers was 226 in 2018. In 2018, the share of locally produced parts in the Vietnamese automotive industry was just 10%, compared to up to 80% in Thailand and Indonesia. Due to most advanced parts having to be imported, locally produced vehicles are generally more expensive than foreign built vehicles.


## Taxes on motor vehicles

Vietnam has a Special Consumption Tax that applies to cars. For small cars with less than nine seats and 1.5-litre engines or smaller, it adds an extra 35 percent to the price. However, this increases with every additional litre or so to 150 percent for cars with engines with a capacity of 6 litres or more. Despite this, Lamborghini, Porsche, and McLaren all have dealerships in Vietnam.

Furthermore, cars in Vietnam are also subject to Vietnam’s Value Added Tax–this is normally 10 percent, but, is currently sitting at 8 percent as part of a government stimulus package.
