**Cheil Industries** was an affiliate of the Samsung Group.

Since its establishment in 1954, Cheil Industries has been a Korean textile firm.

Thereafter, from the 1980s, the company expanded its business areas into fashion, chemicals and electronic chemical materials (ECM).

* 2015: Cheil announced plans to acquire Samsung C&T for $7.7 billion, in an all-stock transaction viewed as consolidating Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong's control over the Samsung Group. Elliott Associates, an American hedge fund that owned 7.1% of Samsung C&T's stock, opposed the transaction and attempted to block it in court on the basis that it was not in the best interest of shareholders. The merger was approved by the shareholders in July and executed in September 2015. The combined company was named 'Samsung C&T' (http://www.samsungcnt.com/eng/overview/info.do).

## Fashion

Cheil Industries began its business by producing textiles since 1954. The company then expanded its business areas into fashion by launching its first men's wear range in 1989. Since then, it has diversified into casual wear, ladies' wear and sportswear.

Cheil Industries was the first Korean fashion company to introduce the just-in-time (JIT) system as part of its restructuring efforts, considerably enhancing management efficiency through reduced lead time in the manufacturing process. It also made moves via consistent brand restructuring initiatives to enter into new business lines that it deems to have high growth potential. Through these initiatives, Cheil Industries was successful in building a profitable business structure, thereby establishing itself as a fashion company.
