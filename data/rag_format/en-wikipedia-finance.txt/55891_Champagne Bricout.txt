## History

Martin Financial acquired the company in 1998, but due to financial difficulties, sold it to the financial holding US-Luxembourg Opson Schneider in 2003. Opson Schneider filed for bankruptcy, which caused a scandal unprecedented in Champagne, Following the liquidation of the assets of Pierre Martin, LVMH, and Vranken-Pommery Monopole, 400 hectares of vineyards are now shared, including 200 hectares from Bricout, Avize.
