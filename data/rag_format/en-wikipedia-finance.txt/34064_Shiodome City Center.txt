It was planning on moving its headquarters from Tokyo International Airport. ANA announced that it was also moving some subsidiaries to the Shiodome City Center. When Shiodome City Center opened, Nippon Cargo Airlines moved its headquarters into the facility. The airline had its headquarters and its East Japan sales office on the 8th floor.
