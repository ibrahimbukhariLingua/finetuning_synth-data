**Nationstar Mortgage LLC**, doing business as **Mr. Cooper**, is a home loan servicer headquartered based in Dallas, Texas, area. It is the consumer-facing mortgage lender and servicer of its parent company Mr. Cooper Group. It is one of the largest mortgage servicers in the United States with a servicing portfolio of approximately $1.2 trillion and more than 5.4 million customers.


## History

Nationstar was founded in Denver, Colorado, in 1994 as Nova Credit Corporation. In 1997, the company moved to Dallas, Texas, where homebuilder Centex Homes established Nova Credit Corporation as their in-house lender for new construction and changed the company name to Centex Credit Corporation. In 2001, Centex Credit Corporation was merged into Centex Home Equity Company, and it operated as the subprime mortgage originator and servicer for Centex until 2005.

In 2005, the decision was made to withdraw Centex Homes from non-homebuilding businesses, including the mortgage business. Fortress Investment Group acquired Centex Home Equity and renamed it Nationstar Mortgage in 2006.

In March 2012, Nationstar Mortgage Holdings, Inc. went public with an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.

Nationstar Mortgages, LLC, is the consumer-facing mortgage lender and servicer that operates under the service mark "Mr. Cooper". In August 2017, Nationstar Mortgages, LLC, announced it was changing its name to Mr. Cooper after releasing its worst financial report to date. The company stated that the name change was meant to "personalize the mortgage experience". In 2018 Nationstar and WMI Holdings Corporation (WMIH), the corporate successor to the defunct Washington Mutual, merged. As a result, Nationstar was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and WMIH changed its name to Mr. Cooper Group.


## Controversies

In 2020 Nationstar Mortgage was ordered to pay $73 million by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to roughly 40,000 homeowners for failing to provide basic operations as a mortgage servicing company from the span of 2012 to 2016. Along with that Nationstar also failed to inform borrowers they no longer needed to make private mortgage insurance payments, and has customers making payments on a mortgage they no longer had and foreclosed on borrowers after promising it would not foreclose.
