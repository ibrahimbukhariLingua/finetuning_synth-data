## History

In 1926, Elyria Memorial Hospital administrator John R. Mannix began experimenting with the idea of hospital pre-payment and the basic principles of insurance, eventually leading to the formation of the Cleveland Hospital Service Association in 1934. At this time, hospital associations such as the CHSA became known as Blue Cross Plans. In 1939, Blue Cross Plans united to form the Blue Cross Association

In 1956, Medical Mutual of Cleveland was formed to provide coverage for doctor fees. CHSA merged with Akron Hospital Service to form Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio in 1957, and four years later, Medical Mutual of Cleveland became affiliated with the Blue Shield system.

In 1984, Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio and Medical Mutual of Cleveland merged to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Northern Ohio. Two years after the merger, the new company joined Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Northwest Ohio to form Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio.

In 1997, the company left the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association and re-claimed the name of one of its predecessors, becoming the present day Medical Mutual of Ohio.
