## History


### Background

NOV's two main predecessors, Oilwell Supply and National Supply, were founded in 1862 and 1893, respectively. These two companies manufactured and distributed pumps and derricks. In 1930, United States Steel acquired Oilwell Supply. In 1958, Armco Steel merged with National Supply. In 1987, National Supply merged with USS Oilwell to become "National Oilwell".

Varco was founded as Abegg and Reinhold Company by Walter Abegg and Baldwin Reinhold in 1908. "VARCO" is an acronym for: **V**uilleumiere, **A**begg and **R**einhold **Co**mpany after Edgar Vuilleumiere became a partner in 1915, and Varco International in 1973. In 2000, National Oilwell merged with IRI International Corp. (founded as a merger of **I**ngersoll **R**and Oilfield Products Co. and **I**DECO Inc. (**I**nternational **D**errick and **E**quipment **Co**mpany)), founded and managed by Hushang Ansary, which manufactures and sells drilling rigs and specialty steel products.

In 2005, National Oilwell and Varco merged to become **National Oilwell Varco**.


### Recent history

The company acquired major drill pipe and drill bit manufacturer Grant Prideco in 2008 for $7.37 billion. At the time, Grant Prideco held 60% of the global drill pipe market and operated 25 manufacturing sites worldwide. The acquisition included Grant Prideco's subsidiaries IntelliServ, a producer of drill pipe with built-in equipment to transmit data from a wellhead to surface operators, ReedHycalog, a drill bit producer, and XL Systems, a producer of oil and gas connectors. Grant Prideco, IntelliServ, and ReedHycalog became part of NOV's Wellbore Technologies reporting segment and XL Systems joined the Completion & Production Solutions segment.

In February 2012 NOV acquired Russian coring company Interval Ltd. and purchased Dutch oil rig design company GustoMSC in 2018. GustoMSC, originally the engineering office of Gusto Shipyard, became part of NOV's Rig Technologies segment. In late 2019, NOV bought Bellingham, Washington-based Ershigs, a fabricator of custom pipes and tanks.

National Oilwell Varco changed its name to **NOV Inc.** on January 1, 2021.
