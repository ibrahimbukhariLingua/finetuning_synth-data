**Zeacom** was a software company based in Auckland, New Zealand, with offices in the USA (Orange County, CA), the United Kingdom and Australia. The company sold Call Center and Unified Communications software applications to customers worldwide through large vendors and accredited resellers.

Zeacom Communications Center was the company's flagship product, and was in use at over 3,500 sites worldwide. It integrated with NEC, Cisco and Avaya PBX platforms, and interoperated with Microsoft Lync.

In 2012, the company was acquired by Phoenix, AZ-based communications company Enghouse Interactive, and the Zeacom Communications Center was rebranded as Enghouse Interactive Communications Centre (EICC).
