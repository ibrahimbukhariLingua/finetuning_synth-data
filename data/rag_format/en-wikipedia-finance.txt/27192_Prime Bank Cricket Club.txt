## History

Prime Bank Limited established its cricket club and associated cricket academy in 2012, when it bought the ownership rights of the Old DOHS Sports Club cricket team. When the Dhaka Premier Division resumed in 2013–14 after a one-season hiatus, with List A status for the first time, Prime Bank Cricket Club was one of the 12 competing teams.

In 2014–15 Old DOHS returned to the Dhaka Premier Division as a separate team. Prime Bank won the first encounter between the two teams by 41 runs, and went on to win the championship.
