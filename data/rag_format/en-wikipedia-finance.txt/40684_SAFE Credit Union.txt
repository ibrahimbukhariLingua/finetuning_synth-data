## History

The credit union was founded in 1940 as the Sacramento Air Depot Federal Credit Union and originally served employees at the Sacramento Air Depot. By 1998, their members voted to convert to a state charter which changed the name to what it is today.

In 2007, the credit union acquired Capital Power Credit Union, founded in 1954, and rebranded its one location, retaining the staff.

In 2009, the credit union announced a merger with Rancho Cordova-based American River HealthPro Credit Union which resulted in the closure of three of the four American River HealthPro credit union branches, and the rebranding of the fourth branch as a SAFE Credit Union branch.

In 2019, the credit union acquired a 25 year naming rights for the area's convention center and performing arts district.

In 2023, Faye Nabhani became the first female President & CEO of the credit union.
