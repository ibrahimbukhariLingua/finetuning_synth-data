# Farmfoods



**Farmfoods Limited** is a Scottish frozen food and grocery supermarket chain based in Cumbernauld, Scotland. It is owned by Eric Herd, and has over three hundred shops in the United Kingdom, of which more than a hundred are in Scotland.

Farmfoods primarily focuses on frozen foods, however they also stock a range of grocery, fresh produce, chilled, household, electrical and beauty products.


## History

The company started in 1954 as a meat-processing business. A shop was opened in Aberdeen in the 1970s, and by the mid-1980s the company had about twenty outlets.

In the 1990s, it bought Capital Freezer Centres and Wallis Frozen Foods. In 2005 it had annual sales of just over £400 million, the highest of any private mid-market firm in Scotland in that year, and fourth-highest in the United Kingdom.

In 2011, Farmfoods and Asda made an unsuccessful bid for Iceland; Farmfoods would have acquired two hundred of the eight hundred stores.

In recent years Farmfoods have been opening larger stores and closing smaller ones as they enlarge their non food range. They have also taken over numerous old Aldi and Lidl supermarket sites.

In 2023, Farmfoods began revamping some of their stores with a new interior design.

Farmfoods announced in May 2024 an expansion plan that would mean opening 20 to 30 new stores a year with more stores in the London area being a priority. In the first four months of 2024 Farmfoods secured sites for 24 new stores throughout the country.

The company is headquartered in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, with some head office functions operating out of Solihull and Yardley, Birmingham in the West Midlands.
