UCLA Anderson School of Management


# UCLA Anderson School of Management



The **John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management** (branded as **UCLA Anderson**) is the graduate business school at the University of California, Los Angeles. The school offers MBA (full-time, part-time, executive), Post Graduate Program for Executives (PGPX), Financial Engineering, Business Analytics, and PhD degrees. It was named after American billionaire John E. Anderson in 1987, after he donated $15 million to the School of Management (the largest gift received from an individual by the University of California at the time).


## History

The School of Management at UCLA was founded in 1935, and the MBA degree was authorized by the Regents of the University of California four years later. In its early years, the school was primarily an undergraduate institution, although this began to change in the 1950s after the appointment of Neil H. Jacoby as dean; the last undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969. UCLA is rare among public universities in the United States for not offering undergraduate business administration degrees. Undergraduate degrees in business economics are offered through the UCLA College of Letters and Science.

In 1950, the school was renamed the School of Business Administration. Five years later, it became the Graduate School of Business Administration; in the 1970s the school's name was changed again to the Graduate School of Management.

In 1987, John E. Anderson (1917–2011), class of 1940, donated $15 million to the school and prompted the construction of a new complex at the north end of UCLA's campus. He later donated additional $25 million. The six-building, 285,000-square-foot (26,500 m²) facility, was designed by Henry N. Cobb of the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and Executive Architects Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Associates. It cost $75 million to construct and opened officially in 1995.

On May 13, 2015, Marion Anderson, widow of the late John Anderson, announced a $100 million donation (4th single-largest donation to a business school in the United States) to the school for fellowships and research, along with $40 million earmarked for initiating development of what is now known as the Marion Anderson Hall.

Recently, the school has been mostly self-funded, with only $6 million of government funding out of its $96 million budget in 2010-11. In fall 2010, the school proposed "financial self-sufficiency": Giving up all state funding, in return for freedom from some state rules and freedom to raise tuition. Critics called this proposal "privatization", but the school rejected this description, with former Dean Judy Olian saying, "This is not privatization.... We will continue to be part of UCLA and part of the state." The proposal met objections in the UCLA Academic Senate (faculty members from all UCLA departments), but was ultimately approved by the University of California President Mark Yudof in June 2013. The year 2010 also marked UCLA Anderson's entry into the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, with its inaugural Consortium class enrolling in the full-time MBA program during Fall 2011.

In July 2018, Judy D. Olian, who served as the eighth dean of UCLA's Anderson School of Management, became Quinnipiac University's first female president when she took over for John Lahey, who retired in June 2018. Alfred Osborne, Associate Senior Dean of External Affairs and a professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, began serving as the school’s interim dean on July 1, 2018. Antonio Bernardo, a member of the finance faculty since 1994, was appointed UCLA Anderson’s ninth dean, effective July 1, 2019.


## Campus

The school is located on north part of the UCLA campus. The four main buildings, Mullin, Cornell, Entrepreneurs, and Gold, form an inner circle at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Westwood Plaza, which is the extension of Westwood Boulevard. Connected to the Gold building is the Collins building, which is named for alumnus James A. Collins, who is the chairman emeritus of Sizzler International, Inc. and who funded the John R. Wooden statue in front of Pauley Pavilion.

The new Marion Anderson Hall addition opened February 12, 2020. The 64,000 square-foot campus addition is estimated to cost $80 million and is one hundred percent donor-funded. Marion Anderson Hall is designed by a collaboration of Gensler, leading the interior architecture, and exterior design by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, the same architectural firm that designed the original Anderson complex. The new building features four floors, interactive work, learning and event spaces, LEED Platinum certification, and will serve as the prominent entrance to the Anderson complex.

Students complete strategic projects for companies partnering with the school, ultimately presenting recommendations to senior management. The program has been around since the late 1960s and is presently led by Professor Gonzalo Freixes, its Faculty Director. In 2004, two alternatives to the field study were introduced: a Business Creation Option, and a research study option.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
