United Hotels Company of America


# United Hotels Company of America



**United Hotels Company of America**, also known as **United Hotels Company**, was a chain of upscale hotels in the United States. The company was headquartered in Niagara Falls, New York, with administrative offices in New York City. The company was founded in 1910 by Frank A. Dudley and by the 1930s, the company was "the largest hotel group in the world under one control."


## History

The "United Hotels Company" was founded in 1910 and incorporated in the state of New York by Frank A. Dudley and F. W. Rockwell. On February 16, 1917, the company reorganized as "United Hotels Company of America" and was incorporated in the state of Delaware.

The company built and operated "first class fire proof hotels" in the more important cities of the United States and Canada. The strategy of the United Hotels Co. was to control 51% or more of the stock of all of its subsidiary operating companies (with certain exceptions, such as "The Onondaga Co.", where 90% of the stock was controlled by the officers of the United Hotels Co.). All of the companies operated the hotels under leases (except King Edward Hotel Co. Ltd., Clifton Co. Ltd., and Mount Royal Hotel Co. Ltd.). The United Hotels Co. owned substantial interests in the company stocks of the real estate companies whose hotels are leased to the operating companies.

Under the direction of hotelier and president Frank A. Dudley, the company eventually grew to become one of North AmericaÂ’s premier hotel companies, operating some of the finest hotels across the United States and Canada. By 1922, the company was operating eighteen hotels, and twenty-five by 1928. In 1924, Gen. J. Leslie Kincaid became president of the company.

By the 1930s, and with the onset of the Great Depression, the company was forced into receivership in November 1933, but it managed to reorganize in May 1934. The earnings of the individual hotels had shrunk by such a percent in the preceding four years that 80% of mortgages were in default, and in some cases, taxes and interest on first mortgages were unpaid. Continuing under Dudley, the newly organized "United Hotels Co. of America" was once again incorporated in New York with headquarters in the United Office Building in Niagara Falls. At that time, the company was also affiliated with the "American Hotels Corporation" chain, making it "the largest hotel group in the world under one control."

When Dudley, who was president of "United Hotels Company of America", vice-president of "American Hotels Corporation", and president or vice-president of 24 subsidiary hotel companies, died on September 21, 1945, at the age of 81, the hotel chain was managing 60 hotels. After his death, many of the company's hotels were acquired by other hotel chains, such as the Hilton Hotel.
