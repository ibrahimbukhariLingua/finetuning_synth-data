**Land Bank of Taiwan** (**LBOT**; Chinese: 臺灣土地銀行; pinyin: *Táiwān Tǔdì Yínháng*; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: *Tâi-ôan-thó͘-tē-gîn-hâng*) is a wholly state-owned bank in Taiwan.


## History

It was owned by the government before its downsizing on December 21, 1998, when it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan.

It is the only bank designated by the ROC government as a specialised bank for handling real estate and agricultural credit. Its objective is to develop national economic construction in coordination with the implementation of the government's housing, agricultural, and land policies.

The history of the Land Bank of Taiwan dates from 1945 and the end of World War II. To facilitate the implementation of land policies such as land-rights equalization and the land-to-the-tiller program in Taiwan, the ROC government allocated 60 million dollars from the national treasury and took over the five branches of the Nippon Kangyo Bank (NKB) set up in Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung during Japanese rule. The “Land Bank of Taiwan” was established in accordance with ROC law on 1 September 1946.

In May 1985, the Land Bank of Taiwan became qualified as a juristic person according to Article 52 of the Banking Act; on 21 December 1998, it became a state-run organization upon implementation of the Province Simplification Statute; on 1 July 2003, it was reorganized as the "Land Bank of Taiwan Co., Ltd." On 21 May 2004, it was transformed into a public company to prepare for initial public offering on privatization.
