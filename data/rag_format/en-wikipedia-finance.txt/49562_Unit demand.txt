Unit demand


# Unit demand



In economics, a **unit demand** agent is an agent who wants to buy a single item, which may be of one of different types. A typical example is a buyer who needs a new car. There are many different types of cars, but usually a buyer will choose only one of them, based on the quality and the price.

If there are *m* different item-types, then a unit-demand valuation function is typically represented by *m* values {\displaystyle v\_{1},\dots ,v\_{m}}, with {\displaystyle v\_{j}} representing the subjective value that the agent derives from item {\displaystyle j}. If the agent receives a set {\displaystyle A} of items, then his total utility is given by:

since he enjoys the most valuable item from {\displaystyle A} and ignores the rest.

Therefore, if the price of item {\displaystyle j} is {\displaystyle p\_{j}}, then a unit-demand buyer will typically want to buy a single item â€“ the item {\displaystyle j} for which the net utility {\displaystyle v\_{j}-p\_{j}} is maximized.


## Ordinal and cardinal definitions

A unit-demand valuation is formally defined by:

* For a preference relation: for every set {\displaystyle B} there is a subset {\displaystyle A\subseteq B} with cardinality {\displaystyle |A|=1}, such that {\displaystyle A\succeq B}.
* For a utility function: For every set {\displaystyle A}:

## Connection to other classes of utility functions

A unit-demand function is an extreme case of a submodular set function.

It is characteristic of items that are pure substitute goods.
