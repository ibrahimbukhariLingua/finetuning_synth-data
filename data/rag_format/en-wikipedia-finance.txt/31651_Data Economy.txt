# Data Economy



***Data Economy*** is an international technology business news and opinion website, magazine and broadcaster founded in 2016. The media outlet is headquartered in London, UK and focuses on the business strategy and finance and investment within the IT infrastructure space, mainly data centres.

Broadmedia Communications, trading as BroadGroup and established in 2002, and a member company of FTSE 250 firm Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC (LSE: ERM), is registered as Data Economy's publisher. The title is also a member of the Professional Publishers Association (PPA).


## History

The Data Economy news website was created in September 2016 following a business dinner in Monaco between publisher and Broadmedia Communications CEO Philip Low and journalist João Marques Lima.

The publication acquired in November 2016, datacentres.com, created in 2005 and whose reporting focused on the development of data centres and cloud infrastructure across the globe. Before the end of the year, Data Economy also launched the Frontline video series, in which it interviews executive officers, technology entrepreneurs and government figures.

Data Economy became part of the Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC portfolio in March 2017, when the organisation acquired Broadmedia Communications. The Daily Mail and General Trust (LSE: DMGT) is the majority shareholder of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC with 49% of the company's stake.

The news source released in June 2017 its first print magazine, with production amounting to six editions yearly. Data Economy also runs a special supplement for specific market regions on a monthly basis.

In late 2017, Data Economy launched its Live series of events made of forums and summits targeted at industry executives, especially investors, operational companies, government and regional investment authorities and law firms. Data Economy is also the official global media partner of all Broadmedia Communications events including the Datacloud and Edge Congress series.

In September 2018, the group revamped its slogan, changing from "Defining data centres and cloud 24/7" to "Invest Wisely", matching its finance and investment focused coverage of the IT infrastructure sector.


## Readership and content

Data Economy is aimed at a worldwide elite of senior IT and operations professionals in the data centre, cloud and data spaces. The publication also targets executives in the finance and investment spectrum and legal ecosphere.

Each issue also contains a special focus such as the Data Economy EMEA 50, America's 50, APAC 50, Women 50, Power 200 or 30 Under 30, which lists the industry's top minds in data centre, cloud and edge in the given region or topic.


### Biannual Lists

In 2017, Data Economy launched the "EMEA 50", a regional ranking of the data centre and cloud sector's top 50 influencers. The list is composed biannually and realised in the publication's June magazine, during the Datacloud Global Congress in Monaco. In the first edition, English industry entrepreneur, businessman, author and philanthropist Michael Tobin OBE ranked as EMEA's most influential leader.

Following the launch of the "EMEA 50", Data Economy also initiated other rankings including 'The 30 Under 30', showcasing the young people who are leading the data centre, cloud and data industries, the world's top 25 finance and investment movers and shakers in data centres and cloud, and the world's first top 50 edge computing influencers.
