## History

A consortium of banks comprising Banco Ambrosiano, Banca d'America e d'Italia, and Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, founded **Interbanca – Banca per i Finanziamenti a Medio Termine** in 1961. By 1997 it had come under the control of Banca Antonveneta, which in 1999 acquired Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura. In June 1999, its parent listed Interbanca on the stock exchange, but then in February 2003 wholly acquired it. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2006, ABN AMRO acquired Antonveneta, only to be itself acquired by a consortium consisting of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis, and Santander. Banco Santander took control of Antonveneta in October 2007 and sold it on to Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena in November at a 36% premium over the valuation for the acquisition. Although Banco Santander had sold Antonveneta, it retained Interbanca for the time being.

In March 2008, Santander sold Interbanca to GE Commercial Finance, receiving in return GE Money businesses in Germany, Finland and Austria, and GE's Card and Auto Financing Businesses in the UK.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Interbanca was merged with the parent company Banca IFIS on 23 October 2017.
