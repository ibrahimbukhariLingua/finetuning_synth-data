## History

Cassa di Risparmio di Fermo was found on 5 July 1857 in the Papal States, which was approved by Pope Pius IX on 29 April. In 1920s, the bank absorbed Cassa di Risparmio di Montottone, Cassa Rurale di Montottone, Cassa di Risparmio di Falerone and Cassa Rurale di Santo Stefano di Monterubbiano. In 1940 Cassa di Risparmio di Sant'Elpidio was absorbed into the bank.

Due to Legge Amato, the bank was split into a company limited by shares (Italian: *società per azioni*) and **Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Fermo** (the banking foundation) in 1991 (approved on 21 December 1991; gazetted on 24 January 1992).

Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo) acquired a minority interests in the bank for 33.3% shares in late 1990s. Cariplo also had a minority interests in neighboring savings bank (Italian: *Cassa di Risparmio*): Ascoli Piceno (Marche), Teramo, Pescara, Chieti (Abruzzo), Foligno, Spoleto (Umbria), Rieti (Lazio) as well as Banca delle Marche (the successor of CR Jesi) and a majority interests in Città di Castello. However, despite Cariplo was merged with Banco Ambrosiano Veneto in 1998, Banca Commerciale Italiana in 1999, Sanpaolo IMI in 2007, Banca CR Firenze in 2008, the foundation remained to control Carifermo, with Intesa Sanpaolo, a successor of Banca Intesa and Cariplo, was the latest owner of the remaining 33.3% shares.

The bank is the only independent savings bank of Marche which is still controlled by the banking foundation; Cassa di Risparmio di Loreto (Carilo) was a subsidiary of Banca delle Marche; Banca delle Marche was bail-out and nationalized in 2015 by Italian National Resolution Fund; both Carilo and new Banca Marche were absorbed by new owner UBI Banca in October 2017.
