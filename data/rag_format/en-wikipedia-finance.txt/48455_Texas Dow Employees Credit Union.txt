The Texas Dow Employees Credit Union was founded by employees of Dow Chemical Company in December 1954, receiving its charter from the State Attorney General that month.

Membership was initially limited to Dow and Ethyl-Dow employees. In 1958, the credit union had 780 members and assets totaling $210,000; by 1971, it had a reported 8,500 members, with assets over $7.5 million.

## TDECU Stadium

In July 2014, the University of Houston and TDECU announced a naming rights partnership to rebrand the Houston Cougars' new 40,000-seat football stadium as TDECU Stadium, with TDECU paying $15 million over 10 years for the rights. The deal runs through June 16, 2024 and at the time was the third-most lucrative naming rights deal among NCAA facilities. There is also a mutual option to extend the deal for another five years at an additional $7.5 million after the original 10-year deal expires. It was the first major corporate sports venue sponsorship for TDECU, which previously had deals with the Texas Bowl game, Sugar Land Skeeters of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.
