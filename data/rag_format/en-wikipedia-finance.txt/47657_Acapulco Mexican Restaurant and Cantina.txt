## History

In 1985, Restaurant Associates acquired Acapulco. When Compass Group acquired Restaurant Associates in 1998, Acapulco became owned by Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Co., a private equity firm that had an ownership stake in Restaurant Associates. Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Co. used Acapulco as the starting point of Real Mex Restaurants, acquiring such chains as El Torito and Chevys Fresh Mex. In 2006, Sun Capital Partners, Inc. purchased Real Mex Restaurants for $359Â million from Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Co.

On October 4, 2011, Real Mex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced that it was putting itself up for sale citing the poor economy as a reason. It was acquired by a group of its noteholders in a bankruptcy auction in 2012. In 2018, FM Restaurants HoldCo, LLC acquired Acapulco Mexican Restaurant and Cantina out of bankruptcy and begun operations under Xperience Restaurant Group.
