## Congressional action

On March 5, 2004, Senate Concurrent Resolution 95, sponsored by Senator Don Nickles, was introduced in the Senate. Debate occurred in the Senate from March 8 to 12 and the Senate adopted an amended resolution shortly after 1 a.m. Friday March 12, 2004 with a vote of 51 to 45 along strict party lines except for Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia, voting Yea. The resolution was then sent to the House.

House Concurrent Resolution 393 was introduced in the House on March 19, 2004 sponsored by Representative Nussle. The resolution was agreed to in the House on March 25 by a vote of 215 - 212; all 215 Yea votes came from Republicans while all Democrats, the Independent Bernie Sanders, and 10 Republicans voted Nay. On March 29, the House amended Senate Resolution 95 to contain the text from House Resolution 393 and agreed to the resolution as amended.

The versions from each chamber being different, a conference committee was convened. The House appointed Representatives Nussle, Portman and Spratt; the Senate appointed Senators Nickles, Domenici, Grassley, Gregg, Conrad, Hollings, and Sarbanes. The committee filed its conference report (House Report 108-498) on May 19, and the House agreed to the conference report later that day by a vote of 216 - 213. The Senate never took up consideration of the report, therefore Congress ultimately did not finalize a budget resolution for fiscal year 2005. In lieu of a budget resolution, the House passed H.R. 649 which resolved that once the House adopts the conference report: "(1) the provisions of the conference report and its joint explanatory statement shall have force and effect in the House" and "(2) for purposes of title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the conference report shall be considered adopted by the Congress." The Senate laid out the budget allocations as part (Section 14007) of the Defense Appropriations Act, 2005.
