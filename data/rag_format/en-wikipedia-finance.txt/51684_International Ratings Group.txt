International Ratings Group


# International Ratings Group



**International Ratings Group** is an international rating agency grouping established the end of 2005, following a comprehensive study undertaken on the total global ratings industry. The study demonstrated the need for a truly international ratings group which focuses exclusively on Emerging Markets (i.e. Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe, South America and Asia).

Accordingly, the basic objective was to bring together a number of independent regional agencies, with a view to agreeing common rating standards, methodologies & symbols, and operating under a single “brand”. The ultimate end goal is the establishment of a single international ratings group covering all the emerging markets.
