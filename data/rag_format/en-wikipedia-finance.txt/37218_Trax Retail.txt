## Partnerships

In January 2019, Trax announced a partnership with Google Cloud Platform. Using Google Cloud Platform, Trax aims to deliver its Retail Watch image recognition product and machine learning capability to retailers to provide real-time shelf insights, such as out-of-stock products.


## Products and services

Trax offers Computer Vision-led products and services to CPG manufacturers and retailers. Its products and services fall into several categories: In-store execution, space planning, market measurement & strategy, and store management.


## Technology

Trax's computer vision technology uses artificial intelligence, fine-grained image recognition, and machine learning engines to convert store images into shelf insights. The technology can recognise products that are similar or identical, such as branded drinks or shampoo bottles but can also differentiate between them based on variety and size.

Trax piloted its machine learning algorithms with initial customers, allowing its algorithm to learn about different products. As the company processes more images, the better the technology gets at recognizing the same products in different shapes and sizes.
