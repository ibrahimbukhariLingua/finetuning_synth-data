# Gerald Loeb Award winners for Local



The Gerald Loeb Award is given annually for multiple categories of business reporting. The "Local" category was awarded for business, financial, or economic stories centered in a geographic area intended for consumers in that area from a local newspaper, magazine, television station, radio station, or website. "Local" replaced "Small & Medium Newspapers" in 2015.
