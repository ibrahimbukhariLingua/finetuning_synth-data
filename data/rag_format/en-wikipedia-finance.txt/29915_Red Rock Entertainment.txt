| *HollyWood Bulldogs* | Bulldogs, tells the rough-and-tumble story of the small community of British stunt performers who went on to dominate Hollywood in the 1970s and 80s. Growing out of the ragtag community of bouncers, gangsters and de-mobbed soldiers who were prepared to take a punch or chuck themselves down a flight of stairs for a few quid, the next generation went on to turn stunt work into a legitimate profession. |

| *War Above the Trenches* | From the origins, the technology and the personal stories, this presenter-led two-part documentary uses actuality and drama on location to reveal how Britain and France together were at the forefront of aerial combat one hundred years before their battles in the Middle East today. War Above the Trenches is an investigation into the bitter struggle for air superiority by France and Britain against Germany on the Western Front during World War One. |
| *An Officer and his Holliness* | The popularity and interest of millions of people around the world in Tibet and their exiled leader, His Holiness 14th Dalai Lama continues even half a century after China invaded Tibet. Why are so many people interested in his story and what can we learn from his principles of love and compassion? Fifty-eight years after China's Most Wanted Man escaped from occupied Tibet, this powerful documentary film follows The Dalai Lama as he returns to the Tibetan borderlands for the first time to retrace his remarkable journey and escape into exile in 1959. Remarkably, this is the first time that the story will have ever been told on film! Narrated by Joanna Lumley. |
| *Walking with Elephants* | Walking with Elephants is about the last great herds of elephants in Africa. With a population of barely 350,000 Savanah elephants left, the biggest of the planet's land animals face extinction within our lifetime. Half of these elephants during the dry season are densely populated in northern Botswana as they are protected by the government there. However, across the border into Namibia, Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe – where many of the elephants return in the wet season, their future is fraught. In Kenya and Tanzania and South Africa, nearly all of the surviving elephants are enclosed in game reserves and no longer roam the wilderness that once saw them travel up to one hundred miles a day. |
