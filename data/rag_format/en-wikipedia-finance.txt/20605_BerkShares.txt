# BerkShares



**BerkShares** is a local currency that circulates in The Berkshires region of Massachusetts. It was launched on September 29, 2006 by BerkShares Inc., with research and development assistance from the Schumacher Center for a New Economics. The BerkShares website lists around 400 businesses in Berkshire County that accept the currency. Since launch, over 10 million BerkShares have been issued from participating branch offices of local banks (as of February 2020, nine branches of three different banks). The bills were designed by John Isaacs and were printed by Excelsior Printing on special paper with incorporated security features from Crane & Co. BerkShares are pegged with an exchange rate to the US dollar, but the Schumacher Center has discussed the possibility of pegging its value to a basket of local goods in order to insulate the local economy against volatility in the US economy.


## Use

BerkShares are a local currency designed and issued for the Berkshire region of Massachusetts. As of 2013 according to the BerkShares website, residents purchased BerkShares at 95 cents (USD) per BerkShare from one of sixteen branches of four local participating banks. Businesses then accept BerkShares at full dollar value, differentiating the business as one supporting the BerkShares values of local economy, ecology, sustainability, and community, and creating a five percent discount incentive for those using the currency. BerkShares can then be used by accepting businesses to purchase goods and services from other participating businesses, make change, pay salaries, or support local non-profits, increasing the local economic multiplier effect and keeping value recirculating in the region. If businesses have an excess of BerkShares, they may also be returned to a participating bank at the equivalent rate of 95 cents per BerkShare (i.e., charging no exchange fee).

Over 400 locally-owned businesses currently accept BerkShares for donations. Four participating banks provide BerkShares with 16 brick-and-mortar offices where residents can exchange dollars for BerkShares and receive more information on the project.

Number of exchange points and businesses involved is steadily decreasing. As of 2024 there is six offices of two banks and just over 300 businesses accepting payments in BerkShares. The six bank offices exchange US Dollars for BerkShares at 1:1 rate. Businesses can convert BerkShares back to US Dollars at the same rate with 1,5 % fee. Individuals can convert maximum of $5 equivalent with $0.5 fee. Membership in BerkShares costs 25 BerkShares or $25 annually.
