Grand Duke Ramon, ruler of Abacco, is suffering from financial difficulties. He has already had to sell almost all his possessions. His biggest financier and creditor, the shady crook Mircovich, is already devising a devious plan to overthrow the duke, because he wants to rule the country himself.

However, when the American Bekker discovers underground sulfur deposits, the situation changes because he offers the duke a large sum in order to be able to mine the sulphur. However, the Duke refuses to accept the purchase offer. A short time later he has to resign because he no longer has any financial means.
