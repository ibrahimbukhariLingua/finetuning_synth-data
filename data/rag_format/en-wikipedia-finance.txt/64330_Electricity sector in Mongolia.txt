Electricity sector in Mongolia


# Electricity sector in Mongolia



The **electricity sector in Mongolia** ranges from generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity in Mongolia.


## Generation


### Capacity

In 2018, Mongolia generated 8.2 TWh of electricity in which 6.5 TWh (79.7%) was generated domestically and 1.7 TWh (20.3%) was imported from China and Russia.


### Power plants

In 2010, the total amount of electricity produced by all types of power plant in Mongolia are 4,256.1 GWh (thermal power), 31 GWh (hydroelectric), 13.2 GWh (diesel) and 0.6 GWh (solar and wind).


### Fuel types

In 2012, coal was used to generate 98% of the electricity in Mongolia.

| Electricity generation by power source (GWh) | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year | Coal | Oil | Hydro | Wind |
| 2015 | 4670 | 10 | 70 | 150 |
| 2014 | 4510 | 10 | 60 | 120 |
| 2013 | 4280 | 10 | 60 | 50 |


## Transmission

Due to its large and sparse population, the electrical grid in Mongolia is divided into four areas, which are Central Energy System (CES), Western Energy System, Eastern Energy System and Altai-Uliastai Energy System. The CES is interconnected with electrical grid of Russia at 220kV level.


## Distribution

The sole electrical distribution company in Ulaanbaatar is the Ulaanbaatar Electricity Distribution Network.


## Consumption

In the 2023â€“2024 winter, the maximum electrical load in Mongolia is expected to be about 1,567 MW.

In 2018, much of Mongolia's electricity consumption was driven by industry and construction.
