In May 2011, Mavenir Systems acquired Airwide Solutions, a Massachusetts-based mobile messaging and wireless internet infrastructure company.

Mavenir Systems provided VoLTE service to MetroPCS in 2012. The company partnered with Radisys in February 2013 on VoLTE deployments in Europe and the United States. 4G Americas, a wireless industry trade association, elected Mavenir Systems to its Board of Governors in April 2013. The company opened a user experience center in Zagreb, Croatia in April 2013. The center intended to demonstrate and bring new offerings for VoWi-Fi, VoLTE and rich communication services (RCS) to the market.

The company priced its shares at $10 and raised approximately $44.5 million in the initial public offering.

The gateway furthered T-Hrvatski Telekom's Terastream project, a simplified service delivery model. In May, Mavenir Systems released a mobile voice and messaging client software for handsets and tablets. The software was aimed to allow mobile operators to differentiate their Voice over LTE (VoLTE), Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) and Rich Communication Services (RCS).

The company began developing a VoWiFi mobile app for 3UK on HockeyApp, a service to develop and test mobile apps, in June 2014.

## End

In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million; the acquisition became effective the following month. Thus the first incarnation of Mavenir came to an end.

Two years later, as the result of the merger of established company Xura with the Mavenir Systems part of Mitel and the startup Ranzure, a new company named Mavenir was formed.
