# James Altucher



**James Altucher** (born January 22, 1968) is an American hedge-fund manager, author, podcaster and entrepreneur who has founded or cofounded over 20 companies. He has published 20 books and is a contributor to publications including *The Financial Times*, *The Wall Street Journal*, *TechCrunch*, and *The Huffington Post*.


## Early life and education

Altucher was raised in a Jewish family in North Brunswick, New Jersey. Altucher attended North Brunswick Township High School and graduated in 1986. Altucher graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 1989.


## Career

Altucher's first job after graduating was in the IT department at HBO. At one point, Altucher hosted a web-series for HBO.com called *III:am*.

In 1998, Altucher left HBO, sold a company he founded, Reset Inc., for approximately $15 million, and used the proceeds to fund new internet investments. Altucher has said he began this period with $15 million and lost it all in two years, which led him to re-evaluate his approach to both business and life. During this time, Jim Cramer of TheStreet.com hired him to write about stocks, and Altucher began trading for hedge funds.

From 2002 to 2005, he traded for several hedge funds, and, from 2004 to 2006, ran a fund of hedge funds.

In 2006, Altucher founded the financial social network, StockPickr. The website was named one of *Time Magazine'*s 50 Best Websites of 2007. Altucher sold the company for $10 million in 2007.

In 2017, he began advising on cryptocurrency investing, despite having condemned Bitcoin in 2013 as "a fad, or a scam, or a ponzi scheme, or worse." However, in May, 2013, he built a store to sell his book, "*Choose Yourself*" for Bitcoin a month before he released it on Amazon. He was interviewed by *Business Insider* about why he reversed his stance on Bitcoin.

Altucher was a seed investor in Buddy Media, which later sold to Salesforce.com for $745 million in 2012.
