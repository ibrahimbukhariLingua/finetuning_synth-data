## History

The company was founded in 2004 by Tatyana Kim. Kim started the business at the age of 28 in her Moscow apartment while on maternity leave from teaching. She realized how difficult it was for her and other young mothers to shop for clothes for themselves with a newborn at home. Her husband, Vladislav Bakalchuk, an IT technician, soon joined her to help build the business.

In 2017, Wildberries became Russia's largest online retailer, surpassing Ulmart. The company, originally based in Milkovo, Moscow Oblast, relocated to Moscow in 2018.

In July 2021, Ukraine imposed sanctions against Wildberries and its owner Tatyana Kim. Trade in military uniforms and anti-Ukrainian books was named as the reason. The company said it didn't have assets in Ukraine or capital, so sanctions wouldn't harm Wildberries, but only Ukrainian entrepreneurs using its platform.
