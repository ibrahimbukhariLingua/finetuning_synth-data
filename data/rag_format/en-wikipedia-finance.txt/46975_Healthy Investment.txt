# Healthy Investment



**Healthy Investment** is a British mutual friendly society that provides a range of ethical With-profits savings and investment products. It was originally formed in 1835 as Independent Order of Rechabites, and traded until 2004 as The Rechabite Friendly Society. As of 2018ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ it had more than 100,000 members and looked after over £115m of members' money.


## History

On 25 August 1835 a small group of men, already committed to the total abstinence of alcohol, met in Mrs Meadowcroft's Temperance Hotel, Bolton Street, Salford in order to discuss a friendly society for those who had "signed the pledge" and abstained from alcohol. From its first procession on New Year's Day in 1836 the organisation grew rapidly with local groups known as "tents" being formed throughout the country. In 1842 contributions of two shillings per year for the under 35s entitled them to £5 death benefit and a further penny a week provided them with a sickness benefit of two shillings and six pence.

In 1999 the Society, by now known as The Rechabite Friendly Society, modernised and centralised its various local groups and regions into one Manchester-based Head Office. In 2004 the Society developed further and opened its membership to include temperate members or those who "enjoy alcohol in moderation".ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Today The Rechabite Friendly Society trades as Healthy Investment.

The Society's head office is now based in Bury, Greater Manchester.
