# McLaren Applied



**McLaren Applied** is a British technology and products company. Capabilities include design, development, manufacture and test of electronic, mechanical, electrical and software products. The company is focused on four industries: motorsport, automotive, transport and mining. McLaren Applied was formerly a part of McLaren Group and since 2021 a fully independent company, which owned by the private investment firm Greybull Capital.


## History

The present company was formed when two McLaren Technology Group companies merged - 'McLaren Composites and TAG Electronics. The companies merged due to the sale of Audiolab to International Audio Group. TAG Electronics Holdings was the parent company of TAGMcLaren Audio (Now Audiolab) and also TAG Electronics Systems. When Audiolab was sold, the holding company TAG Electronics Holdings was scrapped and the remaining technology company merged with McLaren Composites, which both together then formed McLaren Applied Technologies.

In September 2014, Ian Rhodes replaced the founder, Ron Dennis, as CEO of the company. McLaren Applied was initially known as "McLaren Composites", its main work being the manufacture of parts for the McLaren F1 and Mercedes SLR. However, it also won contracts to manufacture parts for other companies and moved into the energy industry, mainly solar panels. It was dissolved in 2003 and replaced with "McLaren Applied Technologies" a short while after in 2004.

The company name was changed again on 2 January 2020 to McLaren Applied Limited.

In 2021 McLaren Group, suffering financial distress as a result of the Covid19 pandemic, sold the company to Greybull Capital. McLaren Applied has seen substantial new investment in its facilities, products and staff under Greybull's ownership.

McLaren Applied handled electronics and data for the Ekofisk drilling plant in the North Sea.
