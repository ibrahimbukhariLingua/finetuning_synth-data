## History


### 1984-1997: Asymetrix

**Asymetrix Learning Systems**, based in Bellevue, Washington, was founded in 1984 by Paul Allen and funded through his Vulcan Ventures. Asymetrix then spent around ten years developing software for online education. Among the first products from this development period were ToolBook, *Asymetrix Librarian,* and the *e-Learning Network* – an early software as a service product. Additionally, an early three-dimensional rendering system Asymetrix 3D F/X was released in 1994 and later renamed Web3d.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Asymetrix also produced a variety of screen savers for a short period and developed *Compel* (a graphical presentation and prototyping program).

The company was recapitalized in 1995 with more funding from Allen. In October 1996, SoftBank invested about $3.8 million in Asymetrix. In September 1997, Asymetrix acquired Aimtech for about $3.1 million in stock. In October 1996, the company spun off its client/server tools into a newly created wholly owned subsidiary, ASX Corporation, which was renamed ConQuer Data, Inc.
