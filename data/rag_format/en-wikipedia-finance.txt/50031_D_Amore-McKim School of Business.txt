# D'Amore-McKim School of Business



The **D'Amore-McKim School of Business** is the business school of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. The business program was founded in 1922, followed by the Graduate School of Business Administration in 1952.

Northeastern University's cooperative education program, which allows students to alternative semesters of study and full-time professional experience, works with more than 3,500 employers in nearly 50 countries around the world.

The D'Amore-McKim School has more than 50,000 living alumni, including graduates from both the graduate and undergraduate programs, in 137 countries globally.


## History

The D'Amore-McKim School of Business can trace its history back to the earliest days of Northeastern's existence, when commerce and industry courses were offered in 1907 by the School of Commerce and Finance of the Boston Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). The fundamental aim of the school was to provide students with courses in commerce, accounting and finance in preparation for business positions. During that first year, 25 courses were offered, 18 instructors were hired and 208 students enrolled. Through evening study, B.C.S. and M.C.S degrees were eventually offered. After years of consideration, a School of Business Administration opened in September 1922, offering courses in general business, industrial management, marketing, finance and accounting. The first two years of the four-year program were devoted to learning sound business principles and the last two years were dedicated to specialization leading to definite marketable skills. The first MBA program was launched in 1951 as part of an Evening Division, and in 1958 the program became part of the Graduate School.

The business school is housed in Dodge Hall on Krentzman Quadrangle off Huntington Avenue in Boston. Constructed in 1952, it was named for Robert Gray Dodge, chairman of Northeastern's Board of Trustees from 1936 to 1959. The basement of the five-story building once housed the university's main library, from 1952 until 1990, when Snell Library opened.


### Naming donation

On September 12, 2012, Northeastern University announced a $60 million gift by alumni Richard D'Amore and Alan McKim, as "the largest philanthropic investment in the university's history...[and] the fourth-largest gift to name a business school in the United States." As a result of the gift, Northeastern's College of Business Administration was renamed the D'Amore-McKim School of Business. It was the first college or school to be named at Northeastern.
