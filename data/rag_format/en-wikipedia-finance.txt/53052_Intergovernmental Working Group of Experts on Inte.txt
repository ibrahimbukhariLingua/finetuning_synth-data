# Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting



The **Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR)** is hosted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Created in 1982 by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), its mission is to facilitate investment, development and economic stability by promoting good practices in corporate transparency and accounting.


## Annual sessions and workshops

The Working Group holds its annual sessions and workshops at the United Nations Office at Geneva, Switzerland, with several hundred delegates attending from more than half of the UN member states. Participants include policymakers, regulators, and representatives from academia, civil society, private industry and various national, regional and international accountancy organizations.
