## Early life and education

Irons was born in Hulbert, Oklahoma on August 29, 1923, the third of four children in a partially Cherokee family. After graduating from high school as valedictorian of the Attucks School, he served in the U.S. Navy. He graduated from Wilberforce University with a BS degree in business administration around 1948, worked for a year at Tulsa's Moton Memorial Hospital, and then attended the University of Minnesota, where he graduated in 1951 with an MA degree in hospital administration, winning an award for the best management thesis in his class.

He was hired by Oklahoma governor Johnston Murray to manage the Oklahoma state hospital system, resigning when he was unable to raise salaries. He then worked as a business manager for Florida A&M University. He left this position over his participation in the Tallahassee bus boycott in 1956, to pursue doctoral work in finance at Harvard.

In 1959, he was the second Black person to receive a doctoral degree from Harvard Business School, writing a thesis on "The Organization of a Bank; a Study of Selected New Banks."
