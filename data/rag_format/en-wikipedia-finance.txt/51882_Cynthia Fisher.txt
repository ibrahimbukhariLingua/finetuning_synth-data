## Career

Fisher began her career at IBM in sales and marketing in 1983. After receiving her MBA in 1990 from Harvard Business School, she joined Haemonetics and was marketing manager of the Blood Bank Division. In 1993, Fisher set up ViaCord, Inc., a company that tests, types, freezes and stores the umbilical cord blood of newborns for its potential use in treating some cancers, blood disorders, and genetic diseases. She served as CEO from ViaCord’s inception until 2000.

In 2000, Fisher co-founded and was president of ViaCell, a cellular medicines company. ViaCord then became a division of ViaCell. ViaCell went public in 2005 at a $260 million valuation. Fisher’s role in the "rearing" of ViaCell was the subject of a Harvard Business School case study. PerkinElmer acquired ViaCell in 2007 for $300 million for its ViaCord business. Fisher served on the Board of Directors of ViaCord and ViaCell. From 2002 to 2004, she was Chair of the Board of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council.

In 2011, she set up WaterRev, LLC, an investment firm focused on companies with novel technologies that enable sustainable practices of water use. Through 2018, Fisher was on the board of Water.org, the nonprofit organization founded by Gary White and Matt Damon.

Fisher became a director in 2012 of The Boston Beer Company, the maker of Samuel Adams Beer, Angry Orchard Cider, and Twisted Tea. She was the first woman on the company's board, but her appointment was criticized because she was married to Jim Koch, the company's founder.

Since 2015, Fisher has been a director of Easterly Government Properties, a real estate investment trust focused on Class A commercial properties leased to U. S. Government agencies.

In 2016, Fisher co-founded FitMoney, Inc., a nonprofit organization providing K-12 curriculum for financial literacy.
