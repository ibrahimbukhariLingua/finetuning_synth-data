## Early life and education

Adam Blumenthal attended Stuyvesant High School and Harvard College. He was a community organizer in his youth; following his freshman year at Harvard, he took several years off from school to work on the implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act in St. Louis, Missouri, before returning to college. He graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. from Harvard before earning his M.B.A from Yale School of Management in 1989.


## Career

In 1989, Blumenthal joined American Capital, a private equity firm where he was the second employee before the firm began institutional fundraising. Blumenthal served on American Capital's board of directors and held several positions including chief financial officer, chief operating officer, president and vice chairman. By the time he left the firm in 2002, American Capital was managing more than $1 billion in assets and was publicly traded on NASDAQ. After leaving American Capital in 2002, Blumenthal became chief financial officer (CFO) at the New York City Comptroller's office. He succeeded Jane Levine in managing the city's pension funds as First Deputy Comptroller and CFO at the NY Comptroller's office under Bill Thompson until 2005.

Blumenthal is currently chairman and managing partner of Blue Wolf Capital Partners, a mid-size private equity firm that he founded in 2005. At Blue Wolf, Blumenthal makes control investments in middle market companies and adheres to Environmental, Social, and Governance principles. He also serves on the board of directors of several Blue Wolf portfolio companies.

Blumenthal received the 2017 Civic Champion Award from the nonprofit New York City-based magazine City Limits for his work to "preserve union workplaces and promote economic development".

In October 2019, Blumenthal conceived of the term "polarization tax" to describe the burden businesses now face amidst challenging political and economic environments, which contrasts with the benefits of the peace dividend in the 1990s.
