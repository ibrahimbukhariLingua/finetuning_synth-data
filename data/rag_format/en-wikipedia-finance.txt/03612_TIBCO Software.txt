**TIBCO Software Inc.** is a business unit of Cloud Software Group that provides enterprise software. It has headquarters in Palo Alto and offices in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.


## History

TIBCO (The Information Bus Company) was founded in 1997 by Vivek Ranadivé as a subsidiary of Reuters Holdings. Ranadivé originally developed the information bus software at his previous company, Teknekron Software Systems, which he sold to Reuters for $125 million in 1994. TIBCO's software allowed companies to receive and respond to information in real time. Later in 1997, the company became one of 13 to partner with Microsoft in the development of push technology. Its software products which primarily served the financial sector helping automate Wall Street's trading floors during the company's early beginnings, had evolved to be used in energy, semiconductor manufacturing, and other industries, by 1999. The company held an initial public offering (IPO) of stock on July 14, 1999. The company said it raised $109.5 million from its IPO.

In 2000, Yahoo! introduced Corporate Yahoo, a platform developed with TIBCO Software that allowed companies to bundle services including email, calendars, and news into enterprise portals. The company partnered with Hewlett-Packard, WebEx, and Citrix Systems on its development. The company survived the dot-com bubble burst and was listed among *USA Today'*s e-Consumer and e-Business index of 50 technology companies that remained relevant in 2001 following the boom. By the spring of 2001, TIBCO had a market capitalization of $2 billion.

By 2011, the company's annual revenues had grown to $920 million, its customer base to 4,000, and its number of employees to 2,500. TIBCO was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $4.2 billion in December 2014. Murray Rode replaced Ranadivé as chief executive officer (CEO) following the acquisition. In 2019, Rode became vice chairman of the company and Dan Streetman succeeded him as CEO.

TIBCO acquired data and analytics company Information Builders for an undisclosed sum in January 2021. In September 2022, Vista and Elliott Investment Management acquired Florida-based Citrix Systems for $16.5 billion and merged the company with TIBCO, forming Cloud Software Group. Tom Krause was named CEO of the new company.
