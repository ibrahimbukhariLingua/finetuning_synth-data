## Accession of the United Kingdom


### Background

In January 2018, the government of the United Kingdom stated that it was exploring membership of the CPTPP to stimulate exports after Brexit and had held informal discussions with several of the members. In October 2018, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would welcome the United Kingdom joining the partnership post-Brexit.Liz Truss, the UK Secretary of State for Trade, expressed in a joint *Daily Telegraph* article with Simon Birmingham, David Parker, and Chan Chun Sing, the trade ministers of Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, the intent of the United Kingdom to join the CPTPP.

On 1 February 2021, the United Kingdom formally applied to join CPTPP. The UK is the first non-founding country to apply to join the CPTPP. If successful, Britain would become the second-largest CPTPP economy, after Japan. Japan had expressed support for the UK's potential entry into CPTPP in 2018, and as 4th CPTPP Commission (2021) chair, Japan's minister in charge of negotiations on the trade pact, Yasutoshi Nishimura, expressed hope on Twitter that Britain will "demonstrate its strong determination to fully comply with high-standard obligations" of the free trade accord, and mentioned that "I believe that the UK's accession request will have a great potential to expand the high-standard rules beyond the Asia-Pacific."

In June 2021, the CPTPP agreed to open accession talks. A working group was established to discuss tariffs and rules governing investment and trade, led by Japan.

By March 2023, the United Kingdom was set to join the CPTPP, as the 11 members had reached an agreement to Britain's accession. The UK government also announced it had secured an extension mechanism, which could extend the whole agreement to any Crown Dependency or British Overseas Territory. On the same day, Guernsey and Jerseyconfirmed their intentions to participate in CPTPP. In May 2023, a UK government spokesman confirmed that "the deal will cover goods trade between the Crown Dependencies and CPTPP countries, with a mechanism to include trade in services in future."

The United Kingdom formally signed the CPTPP trade deal during the 7th CPTPP Commission - or members ministerial meeting - in New Zealand on 16 July 2023, becoming the first non-original signatory and European country to sign the agreement.
