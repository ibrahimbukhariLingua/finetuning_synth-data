Rangers Sports Network


# Rangers Sports Network



**Rangers Sports Network** is the media division of the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball. Owned by Rangers Sports Media & Entertainment, it will produce and distribute the team's regional broadcasts beginning in the 2025 season, which are planned to be carried via platforms such as over-the-top streaming and agreements with television providers within the team's designated market. It will also syndicate a package of games throughout the season to a network of over-the-air stations within the Rangers' market.


## History

The Texas Rangers were one of several Dallas teams impacted by the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group (now Main Street Sports Group), the owner of the Bally Sports (now FanDuel Sports Network) regional sports networks. The team's contract with Diamond's Bally Sports Southwest expired following the 2024 season, and was not renewed. Diamond also opted out of its contracts with the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and NHL's Dallas Stars, leading to both teams adopting new distribution models for their regional broadcasts; the Mavs partnered with Tegna Inc. and Endeavor Streaming to air its games on KFAA-TV and a direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming service known as MavsTV, while the Stars partnered with A Parent Media Co. to launch Victory+, a free service that would stream the team's games.

The Rangers were reported to be pursuing the distribution of games via multiple platforms, including a streaming platform and *ad-hoc* agreements with local television providers; this "direct-to-distributor" model would be similar to MLB Local Media, except managed in-house by the team. Ahead of official announcements, the Rangers announced on January 15 that it had reached an agreement with Victory+ to host a DTC subscription service.

On January 27, 2025, the Rangers officially announced the formation of Rangers Sports Network, its new in-house broadcasting unit. The team also announced the formation of a new division known as Rangers Sports Media & Entertainment; the subsidiary will house both Rangers Sports Network and Rev Entertainment—a sister event production and marketing firm.


## Carriage

The Rangers pursued a multi-platform approach, including direct-to-consumer options, and partnerships with television providers in the team's home market. The team has reached agreements with AT&T, Charter Communications and DirecTV (including DirecTV Stream) to distribute games to their subscribers via part-time channels. Games will stream on Victory+, which will be available through a paid season pass priced at $100 per-season, or at no additional charge to authenticated subscribers of television providers who carry Rangers Sports Network. The team also announced that a package of 15 games—mostly Friday home games—would be syndicated to broadcast television stations via partnerships with Gray Media and Nexstar Media Group. KDAF in Dallas will serve as the flagship station.
