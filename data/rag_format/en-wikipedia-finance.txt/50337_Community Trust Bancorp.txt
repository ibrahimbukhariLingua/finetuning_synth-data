## History

In the first years of the twentieth century, the economic future of Pike County, Kentucky, looked sufficiently promising to warrant the creation of another bank. This was thanks to the economic success of coal mining, but also the beginning exploration for oil and gas. Thus, Community Trust was founded on November 27, 1903, as Pikeville National Bank. From 1903 through 1912, J. E. Yost served as the institution's first president.

The challenging economic climate of the 1930s brought the first two of many acquisitions. Pikeville National Bank acquired two failing competitors: the National Bank of Hellier and the Day and Night National Bank of Pikeville (the latter's name advertised the fact that the bank promised its customers to be open for business 24 hours a day).

In 1969, Pikeville National Bank began to expand its reach through branch offices, the first of which opened in Phelps. Other innovations of the time included the introduction of VISA cards, the beginning of computer-based transaction processing, and the creation of new departments, such as Audit and Credit.

In 1981, the bank moved its headquarters from the original building on Pikeville's Main Street to a new structure on North Mayo Trail, on the outskirts of town. In the same year, the holding company was brought into existence to facilitate further development. By the end of 1981, the bank had 160 employees and 17 departments.

In 1997, Pikeville National Bank changed its name to Community Trust Bancorp., Inc.
