### 2024 stock manipulation charges and arrest

On July 16, 2024, the Seoul Southern District prosecutors' office revealed that an arrest warrant was sought against Kim on stock manipulation charges which were related to price-rigging that took place in 2023 during a bidding war over SM Entertainment.

In 2021, Kim signed the Giving Pledge, promising to donate more than 50% of his net worth to worthy social causes.


### Gambling accusations

Kim was accused of gambling in Las Vegas from 2007 to 2010, which despite being overseas is illegal under South Korean law as he is a South Korean citizen. South Korean prosecutors reportedly obtained information from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury that Kim had spent 20 hours and 51 minutes at the Bellagio Hotel in 2007 when he served as the CEO of NHN. According to the *Hankook Ilbo*, he bet an average of $2,440 per session and lost $16,993 during that time. NHN decided to comply with the prosecution's warrants requesting monitoring of chatting records, a reversal from its earlier stance.
