## History

Established in 1995 as New T&T Limited, it was one of the firstᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ telecommunication operators to be offered a fixed line license after the Hong Kong Government decided to open this market to competition; Cable & Wireless Hong Kong Telecom had heretofore enjoyed a monopoly. The next year New T&T Limited was offering IDD service and residential fixed-line services.

Making its first net profit in financial year 2001, it was soon after renamed Wharf New T&T Limited.

Another name change, in 2003, yielded Wharf T&T Limited.

In 2007, it founded Wharf T&T eBusiness Limited, a subsidiary that delivers broadband applications and web applications to SME customers.

In 2016, MBK Partners, North Asia’s buyout firm, and TPG, a global alternative asset firm, completed the acquisition of Wharf T&T Limited from The Wharf (Holdings) Limited on 9 November 2016.

In 2017, Wharf T&T Limited announced the Company name change to WTT HK Limited (“WTT”).
