#### Ask.com

In 1995, Gruener alongside David Warthen, a consulting engineer, created a company called Ask Jeeves. After both investing over $250,000 they set up their office in Berkeley, California. Named after the butler in the stories by P.G. Wodehouse "who had an answer to every problem", the firm provides software that operates in a "question-and-answer" format. In 1997, they made their product available for free on the Internet under the name Ask.com. The product utilizes syntactic and semantic analysis to answer the asked question through one of the around 10,000 basic formulas. It shows various versions of the question and allows the user to pick the desired one. In the beginning, the company employed around 40 workers who provided the users with the needed answer to their question. In 1998, the company made around $1 million profit for adverts on its website. In 2003, Gruener stepped out of the chairman position at Ask.com.


#### Virtual Microsystems

*Virtual Microsystems Inc* (VMI) software enabled running MS-DOS and CP/M application programs on Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX minicomputers. As of mid-1988, *Virtual Microsystems Inc* (VMI) and *Logicraft* were "the only commercially available products that let VAX/VMS systems run standard off-the-shelf PC applications from terminals and VAXstations." VMI's "The Bridge" facilitated using the DEC machine's hard disk, which in turn provided better backups than individualized floppy-based arrangements. *The Bridge* is slower than a top end PC; VMI's *Z-Board* add-on matches that speed.

Other benefits included developing software for PCs and printing on DEC-attached high speed printers.


### Politics

Gruener was a candidate for the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election from the Democratic Party. He was one of the candidates who aggressively used the Internet to push his message and also ran campaign ads in selected television markets. Eventually, Gruener finished 28th in a field of 135 candidates with 2,562 votes.
