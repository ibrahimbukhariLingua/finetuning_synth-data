## History

BNDE was founded with a share capital of 60 million BIF.
It survived the crisis that began in 1993, althugh its external lines of credit were frozen for over fifteen years.
Unlike commercial banks, it does not support bank accounts, but mainly finances medium- to long-term development projects.
These included schools, universities (especially private ones), health centers and civil servant housing.
It was a leader in financing micro-projects and funding microfinance institutions.

The six founding members of the Network of Microfinance Institutions in 2002 were the National Bank for Economic Development (BNDE), the Development Finance Company (COFIDE), the Cooperative Savings and Mutual Credit Fund (CECM), the Municipal Development Fund (*Fonds de Développement Communal*, FDC), Twitezimbere ASBL and the Cooperative for Solidarity with Peasants for Savings and Credit (COSPEC).
They wanted a framework to discuss their policies and strategies, to professionalize the sector and to establish a sustainable partnership system.
