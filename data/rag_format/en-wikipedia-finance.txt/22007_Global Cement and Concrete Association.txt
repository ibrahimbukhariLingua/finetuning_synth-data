Global Cement and Concrete Association


# Global Cement and Concrete Association



The **Global Cement and Concrete Association** is an international industry association that was established in 2018. As of 2018, organized and led by five major multinational cement companies, it represented about 35% of the global industry for Cement and Concrete. The association was formed mainly to coordinate markets to protect the interests of the multinational cement corporations and in part, because the industry wanted to participate in sustainable development conversations, participating in COP24 and COP25. The Organization published guidelines for sustainable cement in 2018.
