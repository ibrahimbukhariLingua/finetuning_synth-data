## History

In 2010, Freeh was appointed for a three-year term as an independent compliance monitor in the deferred prosecution agreement between the United States Department of Justice and Daimler AG.

In 2011, Freeh Group Europe was engaged by the FIFA Ethics Committee to investigate allegations of bribery at the global sporting organization. The Freeh Group inquiry uncovered evidence that former FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam offered cash to Caribbean Football Union officials in exchange for their votes in the Federation’s presidential election at the 61st FIFA Congress. This inquiry led to the resignation of FIFA vice president, Trinidadian Jack Warner, as well as a lifetime ban against participation in the organization for bin Hammam.

In the United States, Freeh has been retained to conduct an investigation into allegations of abuse at Pennsylvania State University, and has been appointed as trustee for the MF Global bankruptcy case.
