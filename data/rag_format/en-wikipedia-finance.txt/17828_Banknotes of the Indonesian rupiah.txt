Banknotes of the Indonesian rupiah


# Banknotes of the Indonesian rupiah



The first banknotes used in the archipelago that would become Indonesia were those issued by the United East India Company, credit letters of the rijksdaalder dating between 1783 and 1811. Netherlands Indies gulden government credit paper followed in 1815, and from 1827 to 1842 and again from 1866 to 1948 gulden notes of De Javasche Bank. Lower denominations (below 5 gulden) were issued by the government in 1919–1920 and in 1939–1940 due to wartime metal shortages, but otherwise day-to-day transactions were conducted using coinage.

Gulden notes were issued by "The Japanese Government" during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies from 1942, becoming "roepiah" in 1943.

The first truly Indonesian rupiah notes, however, were issued in 1946, during the war of independence with the Dutch, following the unilateral proclamation of independence by the Indonesians at the end of World War II on 17 August 1945. This money is known as Oeang Republik Indonesia (ORI; *oeang* being the old spelling of *uang* ("money")).

Following the negotiated peace treaty in The Hague of 1949, the ORI was withdrawn, and replaced by an internationally recognised Indonesian rupiah.

The Indonesian rupiah has been subject to numerous devaluations, and in 1965 the existing paper was withdrawn and replaced by a new rupiah at the rate of 1,000 to 1.


## Independence period (1945–1950)


### First series (17 October 1945)

The first 'Indonesian rupiah' bank notes bore the date of the rupiah's proclamation, 17 October 1945, under the authority of the newly-formed republic, and were put in circulation in Java starting from 10 October 1946. The notes were in denominations of 1 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 50 cents, Rp1, Rp5, Rp10, and Rp100.

### Second series (1 January 1947)

The second series of money now emanated from 'Djokjakarta', the Republic's base following the 'Police Action' of 21 July 1947, which had confined the Republicans to Yogyakarta and Central Java. The notes were dated 1 January 1947, in denominations of Rp5, Rp10, Rp25, and Rp100.

### Third series (26 July 1947)

The next new issue was dated 26 July 1947, and consisted of Rp1⁄2, Rp2+1⁄2, Rp25, Rp50, Rp100, and Rp250 notes.


### Fourth series (23 August 1948)

New notes were issued by the national government in 1948, in the bizarre denominations of Rp40, Rp75, Rp100, and Rp400, plus an unissued Rp600 note.

On 19 December 1948, the Dutch seized Yogyakarta, reverting the head office of the then-Republic's central bank Bank Negara Indonesia back to De Javasche Bank, with DJB offices also reopened in Surakarta and Kediri.

It was planned in 1949 to revalue the national rupiah notes of the republic (which were at this time circulating in Java). To do this, "rupiah baru" ('new rupiah') notes were printed. This revaluation did not take place in Java, but some were issued in Aceh instead. The denominations printed were Rp0.10 sen (blue or red), Rp1⁄2 (green or red), Rp1 (purple or green), Rp10 (black or brown), Rp25, and Rp100.


### Regional issues (ORIDA)

In addition to the 'national' (but restricted in practice to the central republican enclave in Java) notes, the republican authorities, instructed regional commanders in areas that the national money couldn't reach to issue their own currency in order to discourage the circulation of Dutch money. These money were to be unified after full independence.

## Old Order (1950–1966)


### Gulden/roepiah notes (1950–1952)


#### Low denomination notes

The Dutch treasury had in 1947 issued Indonesian language Rp0.10 and Rp0.25 notes. Due to the initial lack of coinage and due to their relatively republic-friendly design, the Indonesian government saw it as expedient to continue to print these notes, and authorised their issue until such time as coinage had been minted, and in sufficient quantity to replace them.

#### De Javasche Bank notes

The peace settlement with the Dutch, negotiated in The Hague in November 1949, had kept De Javasche Bank as the central bank in Indonesia, hence the first notes that were issued for the post-independence rupiah bore its imprint. It was decided that the existing De Javasche Bank money dated 1946 would simply be revised in colour, with the 5 gulden note changing from purple to red and green, the 10 gulden from green to purple, and 25 gulden from red to green. In addition, 50 gulden, 100 gulden, 500 gulden, and 1,000 gulden notes were added, still dated 1946.

Because there were existing Rp0.10 and Rp0.25 notes (which remained as legal tender and continued to be printed), a gap existed between the Rp0.25 Indonesia and 5 gulden De Javasche Bank notes. This was filled with Rp1⁄2, Rp1, and Rp2+1⁄2 notes, all dated 1948. The notes in wording were similar to the notes of 5 gulden and up, but the Indonesian text ('roepiah') placed above Dutch ('gulden').

The notes were all printed by Johan Enschede en Zonen based in the Netherlands.

### Federal (Republik Indonesia Serikat) notes (1950)

The RIS government passed legislation on 2 June 1950 to allow it to issue new treasury notes, which were printed by Thomas De La Rue and dated 1 January 1950 in denominations of Rp5 and Rp10. This move was not long-lasting, as the federation dissolved on 17 August 1950.

### Nationalisation of De Javasche Bank: first Republik Indonesia banknotes (1951–1953)

With the nationalisation of De Javasche Bank via the Emergency Act of 1951 which was strengthened by Currency Act of 1953, it was decreed that the government would be able to issue notes valued Rp1 and Rp2½. Thus, 'Republik Indonesia' notes dated 1951 and 1953 were issued in Rp1 and Rp2½ denominations; these were signed by Sjafruddin Prawiranegara in 1951 and Soemitro Djojohadikoesoemo in 1953.

### First ever notes issued by Bank Indonesia (1953)

Notes featuring the new name of the nationalised De Javasche Bank, Bank Indonesia, were prepared dated 1952, in denominations of Rp5, Rp10, Rp25, Rp50, Rp100, Rp500, and Rp1,000, signed by Indra Kasoema as Director, and Sjafruddin Prawiranegara as Governor. The notes began circulating from July 1953 to November 1954 depending on denomination.

Despite the new notes, which meant that paper bearing the name of DJB was no longer printed, the DJB notes dated '1946', and in fact circulating since 1950, remained legal tender right up to the 'new rupiah' of 1965 (which invalidated ALL previous money at that point), although some old DJB notes were repealed, as follows:

* 2 March 1956: 1000 gulden '1946' note dating from 1950 withdrawn, effective 5 March 1959, due to rampant counterfeiting.
* 22 November 1957: Rp1 and Rp2½ '1948' DJB notes withdrawn, effective 1 December 1957, because these denominations of notes were the issuing privilege of the government under the 1914 Currency Act in force at the time of their issue, and hence De Javasche Bank had lacked the authority for their issue.

The few Netherlands Indies government notes (all low denomination) still legal tender were repealed as follows:

* 1 January 1954: all "Nederlandsch Indie" government money withdrawn: 1/2, 1, and 2½ gulden notes, all dating from early World War 2, 1940
* 1 January 1957: Rp0.10 and Rp0.25 "Indonesia" "1947" notes withdrawn (these were also issued by the Republic of Indonesia)

### 1954 government note redesign

In 1954, Rp1 and Rp2½ notes issued by the Indonesian government were redesigned, which were re-dated with the new Minister of Finance's signature in 1956.

### Second "Animals" series of Bank Indonesia banknotes (1958–1959)

In 1957, governor of Bank Indonesia Sjafruddin Prawiranegara commissioned a new series of notes from Thomas De La Rue. However, Sjafruddin's involvement with PRRI meant that he was replaced in January 1958 as governor by Loekman Hakim. Specimens were produced in denominations of Rp5, Rp10, Rp25, Rp50, Rp100, Rp500, Rp1,000, and Rp5,000, and the first of these to be brought into circulation were the Rp100 and Rp1,000 notes in 1958 due to the counterfeiting of these denominations of the 1952 series (it can be distinguished by the wavy line watermark being printed onto the paper rather than a true watermark).

In addition to the 8 notes designed, Loekman commissioned a new Rp2,500 note. Apart from the Rp100 and Rp1,000 notes, the remaining high denomination note, the Rp500, was released on 6 January 1959.

Issuance of the notes was interrupted by a devaluation of 24 August 1959, with Rp500 (tiger) and Rp1,000 (elephant) notes devalued to Rp50 (crocodile) and Rp100 (squirrel) in September 1959. The Rp2,500 and Rp5,000 notes were deemed unnecessary as a result, although continued high inflation caused the former denomination to be issued three years later, while the latter was never issued. The Rp10 and Rp25 notes were only circulated for 3 days although they remained legal tender, and are today extremely rare.

### First Indonesian-designed notes, the "handicrafts" series (1959)

8 September 1959 brought the first purely Indonesian-designed notes, issued by the state printer Pertjetakan Kebajoran. Notes issued are worth Rp5 through Rp100 (see full "handicrafts" section below for full details).


### Thomas De La Rue flowers and birds banknotes (1960)

Another series of notes, the 'flowers' series, was issued by Bank Indonesia in 1960 (showing flowers on the obverse and birds on the reverse), and dated 1 January 1959, but issued in 1960. These notes were printed by Thomas De La Rue.

Due to inflation, the TDLR Rp2,500 note of "animals" design was last issued in September 1962, becoming then the top denomination.

### New design for government banknotes (1960–1961)

A new design for the Rp1 and Rp2½ government notes was issued in 1960 showing agricultural workers on its obverse and its results on its reverse. Notes dated 1960 were signed by Finance Minister Ir. Djuanda Kartawidjaja while notes dated 1961 were signed by Finance Minister Raden Murobikandi Notohamiprojo.

### Complete handicrafts series (1961–1964)

The Bank Indonesia-printed handicrafts series replaced the TDLR notes in 1961 and 1962, with denominations from Rp5 to Rp1,000 being issued. The first Rp10,000 banknote was introduced in 1964. A further response to inflation came with the issue of a 1958-dated Rp5,000 (brown) note in October 1963. By August 1964, it was necessary to add a Rp10,000 note, the first of its kind, and dated "1964," completing the manual workers series.

### Updates to the crafts notes (1965)

In 1965, amid soaring inflation, all of the notes, with the exception of the bottom Rp5 and the Rp500 note of the handicrafts series, were revised and re-issued, some more than once.

### First redenomination (1965)

The hyperinflation of the early 1960s made the government redenominate the rupiah for the first time, with one new rupiah worth 1,000 of the old. Such move meant the issue of an entirely new set of banknotes by the Presidential Decree of 13 December 1965 which authorised Bank Indonesia to issue fractional notes for the first time (although the Rp1 and Rp2½ notes were still issued by the government itself) in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents depicting volunteers (s*ukarelawan*), all of which are dated 1964; these fractional notes, except for the one cent, were demonetised on 15 November 1996 and remain exchangeable in Bank Indonesia until 2029. Continued inflation throughout 1965 and 1966, with rates up to more than 650%, rendered them worthless upon issue. Meanwhile, notes of Rp1 and higher featured President Sukarno on their obverses and various dancers on their reverses, with the 1964-dated Rp1 and Rp2½ banknotes being issued by Republik Indonesia and the 1960-dated Rp5, Rp10, Rp25, Rp50, and Rp100 notes being issued by Bank Indonesia. (1960-dated Bank Indonesia notes of Rp5, Rp10, and Rp100 rupiah were already circulating in Irian Jaya and the Riau Islands along with 1961-dated Republik Indonesia notes of Rp1 and Rp2½ in those same places).

To complete the redenomination process, older notes with values from Rp500 through Rp10,000 were withdrawn throughout 1965 and 1966.

By 1967, it had proved necessary to add Rp500 and Rp1,000 rupiah notes in the same design due to that year's 112% inflation rate.

## New Order (1966–1998)


### Sudirman series (Direksi 1968)

By 1968, after President Suharto's New Order had been established, Bank Indonesia was given the sole right to issue banknotes (including notes below 5 rupiah) as well as coins (which had previously been the issue of the central government).

As such, Bank Indonesia assumed responsibility for the issuance of all denominations of the 1968 series of the rupiah, with all notes being printed by Pertjetakan Kebajoran with the imprint date of 1968 with values ranging from Rp1 to Rp1,000. The notes featured the revolutionary hero General Sudirman on all of their obverses, while their reverse depicts various scenes of industrial activities. The notes were issued in 1968 and 1969. In 1970, notes of the same theme (but a different watermark) were added in Rp5,000 and Rp10,000 denominations, thus restoring all notes to the same denominations prior to the 1965 redenomination.

### Diponegoro series (unissued)

A new series of notes, which now started only at Rp100 (then US$0.24), was designed with a Diponegoro theme in 1971 (but undated); however, this series was never issued, although the Rp1,000 note, with date added, was issued in 1976 (see below), and the reverse of the Rp5,000 note was also used for the 1976 Rp5,000 note, but with a new obverse design. If issued, this aborted note series was the last in Indonesia to have a consistent theme, although new notes typically retained the same colour as old ones of the same denomination. As of 2024, this is the most recent rupiah series to be completely unissued.

### 1975/1977 series

Starting in 1975, Perum Peruri took over the responsibility for printing rupiah notes from Pertjetakan Kebajoran.

Due to counterfeiting of the Sudirman notes, the Rp1,000, Rp5,000 and Rp10,000 notes were all re-designed, dated 1975, and issued in 1976. The Sudirman notes of Rp1,000 and above were withdrawn as legal tender as of 1 September 1977.

Redesigns of the Rp100 and Rp500 notes followed in 1978, thereby completing the third series of notes to be issued since the 1965 devaluation.

### 1979/1980/1982 series

The first note to be replaced was again the top 10,000 rupiah note (by then worth approximately US$16), in 1979. Further redesigned notes followed in all denominations except the 100 rupiah, in 1980 and 1982.

### 1984–1988 series

The Rp100 note was replaced in 1984 with a new design featuring the Goura victoria on its obverse and the Sigura-gura dam in Asahan, North Sumatera, on its reverse with the national coat of arms as its watermark; replacement notes of all denominations followed in 1985 (Rp10,000), 1986 (Rp5,000), 1987 (Rp1,000) and 1988 (Rp500). All notes of this series were updated on 28 December 1992 and were subsequently demonetised on 25 September 1995.

### 1992/1993/1995 series

On 28 December 1992, Bank Indonesia completely overhauled of all denominations of notes for the first time since 1968. In addition, a new top denomination, Rp20,000 note was added, with a US$ value of approximately $10 at the time. This was the first new denomination of the 'new rupiah' since the Rp10,000 had been issued in April 1970 (then worth about US$26). From this issue forwards, Indonesian notes have carried in small text in the note border the year of printing; the most conspicuous date on the note is still the date of authority (e.g., "Direksi 1992").

On 16 February 1993 a new top denomination, Rp50,000 (approx US$22), celebrating "25 Years of Development" was issued. The design featured Suharto on the front and Soekarno-Hatta airport on the back, with a plane taking off to symbolise Indonesia's growth. It also featured a hologram with the BI's logo as an added security feature. The notes (regular) were printed in 1993 and 1994. A polymer version intended as collectables were also issued *(see Commemorative banknotes)*.

In 1995, a segmented security thread was introduced to the Rp20,000 and Rp50,000 notes as an anti-counterfeiting measure, the first ever for the rupiah. Such notes were imprinted as 'Direksi 1995.'

All notes of this series were demonetised on 21 August 2000, except for the banknotes from Rp100 to Rp5000, which were demonetised on 30 November 2006.

## Reformation (1998–present)


### 1998/1999 series

In 1998, during the final months of the New Order, the Rp10,000 and Rp20,000 notes were redesigned on 23 January and 19 February 1998 respectively, while the Rp50,000 note were redesigned on 1 June 1999, the first during the reformation. The new Rp10,000 and Rp20,000 notes now feature a latent image that shows the text "BI" when viewed at a certain angle as an added security feature.

Then-Senior Deputy Governor of Bank Indonesia Mirza Adityaswara's prediction of an increase of demand in cash to anticipate the Year 2000 problem led to the introduction of a new polymer Rp100,000 note on 1 November 1999, with five hundred million notes (totalling Rp500 billion) of this denomination being ordered from Note Printing Australia.

All notes of this series are no longer legal tender since 31 December 2008 and were exchangeable at commercial banks until 30 December 2013 and at Bank Indonesia offices until 30 December 2018.

### 2000–2014 series

The lower denominations, Rp1,000 and Rp5,000, were updated in 2000 and 2001. While the Rp5,000 note is still being printed, the Rp1,000 note was last issued dated 2013 (a limited number of notes dated 2016 were issued later) and, while remaining in circulation, has largely been replaced by a coin of the same value.

The Rp20,000 and Rp100,000 notes were redesigned on 29 December 2004, while the Rp10,000 and Rp50,000 notes were redesigned on 20 October 2005. The Rp100,000 note's material was switched to paper as bank machines have difficulty counting the polymer notes of 1999. All the notes were given better security features, including a segmented security thread and colour-shifting ink, with the Rp100,000 note also given an Irisafe technology to its right which was removed in 2011.

A new denomination, Rp2,000, was issued on 9 July 2009 after several delays following an initial announcement that said note would replace the Rp1,000 note as the lowest note in circulation. However, the latter continued to be printed, most recently in 2022.

On 20 July 2010, the 2005-issue Rp10,000 note was revised, featuring the same theme but with a colour change to purple in order to better distinguish it from the Rp100,000 note. Several changes were also made to the note's security features and devices, including the addition of omron rings and a circle-shaped blind code. The following year, in commemoration of that year's Youth Pledge Day on 28 October 2011, Bank Indonesia updated the Rp20,000, Rp50,000, and Rp100,000 banknotes to feature enhanced security features including *rainbow printing*, omron rings and new blind codes.

Bank Indonesia further updated the Rp100,000 note on 17 August 2014 to deter counterfeiting. These banknotes, which bear the text "Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia" ("The Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia") instead of "Bank Indonesia," still retain the images of the same national figures but have more golden colours and carry an imprint of TE. (abbreviation of "*Tahun Emisi*", Issue Year) 2014 and the signatures of the then-BI governor Agus Martowardojo and the then-Indonesian Finance Minister Chatib Basri.

That same year, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has officially appointed Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as obverse of Rp100,000 banknotes, following the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 22 of 2 June 2014.

### 2016 series

On 19 December 2016, Bank Indonesia completely redesigned all rupiah banknotes in the denominations of Rp1,000, Rp2,000, Rp5,000, Rp10,000, Rp20,000, Rp50,000 and Rp100,000. This series features various national heroes from Indonesia's history. In 2022, Bank Indonesia predicted that notes of this series will be removed from circulation in 2025 or 2026.

### 2022 series

Bank Indonesia introduced a new series of banknotes on 18 August 2022. Officially, they were retroactively issued as legal tender on 17 August 2022 to commemorate Indonesia's 77th year of independence. Similar to the 2016 series, the Indonesian dances and national heroes are still featured on the notes, with some notable changes to their colour scheme, security features and sizes.

## Commemorative banknotes


### Suharto "25 years of development" commemorative Rp50,000 polymer note (1993)

In 1993, a polymer Rp50,000 rupiah note, worth approximately US$24.15 at the time of its release on 18 February (assuming that the exchange rate was Rp2,070 per 1 US dollar at that time period), was issued to celebrate "25 Years of Development" under the New Order; it was the first in Indonesia. It featured a hologram of then-President Suharto and the phrase "Penerbitan Khusus" (*Special Issue*). Only five million notes are printed and each were packed in a presentation pack explaining the 25-year growth plan since 1969. These notes were priced at Rp100,000 upon release, which was double the face value. The design featured Suharto on the front and Soekarno-Hatta airport on the back, with a plane taking off to symbolise Indonesia's growth. However, it is believed that due to poor sales, some of the polymer notes, minus the folder, were issued as regularly circulating money. A paper version (regular note) of similar design was printed from 1993 through 1998.

### 75th anniversary of independence Rp75,000 note (2020)

On 17 August 2020, Bank Indonesia introduced a second commemorative banknote, valued at Rp75,000 ($5 at the time of its release) to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Indonesia's declaration of independence. With a total of 75 million notes being printed, it was the first commemorative banknote to commemorate Indonesia's independence; before that, it was only issued in coins. They were made available to Indonesian citizens over the age of 17, who could purchase a maximum of one banknote by registering online and collecting it at one of the 45 regional Bank Indonesia branches. Due to the high demand, banknotes were subsequently offered for sale online for prices up to Rp8.8 million, more than 117 times its face value. Following rumors that the notes were only merchandise, and not legal tender, the central bank confirmed they could be used for payment transactions. The design of the note also attracted attention, and Bank Indonesia was obliged to deny that one of the children pictured on the back was wearing a traditional costume from China.

## Anti-counterfeit warnings

Until the fall of Suharto 1998, rupiah banknotes featured an anti-counterfeit warning which evolved throughout the years:

* 1945–1947: *Barangsiapa yang meniru atau memalsu uang kertas negara, atau dengan sengaja mengedarkan, menyimpan ataupun memasukkan ke daerah Republik Indonesia uang kertas tiruan atau palsu, dapat dihukum menurut Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana pasal 244, 245 dan 249.* (Whoever imitates or counterfeits banknotes of the state, or deliberately distributes, stores or imports imitation or counterfeit banknotes to the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, will be punished according to Articles 244, 245 and 249 of the Criminal Code.)
* 1947 (on Dutch-issued banknotes): *Di dalam pasal 244, 245 dan 249 dari Kitab Undang-undang Hukuman ditetapkan hukuman untuk yang meniru atau memalsukan uang kertas dan untuk yang mengeluarkan dengan sengaja, menyimpan atau memasukkan uang kertas palsu atau yang dijadikan palsu ke Hindia Belanda.* (In Articles 244, 245 and 249 of the Criminal Code, penalties are stipulated for those who imitate or falsify banknotes and for those who deliberately issue, store or import counterfeit banknotes or those made to be counterfeit into the Dutch East Indies.)
* 1947–1980: *Barangsiapa meniru atau memalsukan uang kertas dan barangsiapa mengeluarkan dengan sengaja atau menyimpan uang kertas tiruan atau uang kertas yang dipalsukan akan dituntut di muka hakim.* (Whoever imitates or falsifies banknotes and whoever issues or keeps imitation or falsified banknotes on purpose will be prosecuted by law.) In the early years of its implementation, this warning was repeated multiple times in microprint, mimicking the technique used on Dutch guilder banknotes.
* 1982–1998: *Barangsiapa meniru, memalsukan uang kertas dan/atau dengan sengaja menyimpan serta mengedarkan uang kertas tiruan atau uang kertas palsu diancam dengan hukuman penjara.* (Whoever imitates, falsifies banknotes and/or deliberately stores and distributes imitation or counterfeit banknotes will be threatened with imprisonment.)

## Security features

* The banknotes are made of cotton fibres, because they are more flexible and not easily ripped. However, the actual material used is the abacá fibre, which is naturally plentiful in Indonesia (especially on the Talaud Islands) and is believed to increase the durability of the banknotes. In 2014, Bank Indonesia plan to use these materials, but in 2016 edition, they prefer to print using paper which was also used to print banknotes from previous editions.
* The minimum security features for naked eyes are watermarks, electrotypes and security threads with colour fibres. In addition to this, extra features may be included, such as holograms, Irisafe iridescent stripes, clear windows, metameric windows and gold patches.
 + Watermark and electrotype are made by controlling the gap of density of the fibres which create certain images for the banknotes. This is done to raise the quality of the notes from the aesthetic view.
 + Security threads are put in the middle of the note's materials so horizontal and vertical lines are shown from top to bottom. The threads also can be made with many variations such as the materials, size, colour and design.
* The 2004 and 2005 note series of Rp10,000, Rp20,000, Rp50,000 and Rp100,000 rupiah, which was revised in 2010 and 2011, introduced several new security features: use of EURion constellation rings, rainbow printing designed to change colour when viewed from different angles, and tactile features for blind people and those with visual difficulties to recognise the different denominations stated on the notes.
