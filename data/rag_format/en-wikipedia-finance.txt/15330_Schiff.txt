Schiff


# Schiff



**Schiff** is a Jewish and German surname meaning "ship". The Schiffs are known from "about 1370, the earliest date to which any contemporary Jewish family can be definitely traced".

The Schiff family, is a prominent Jewish banking dynasty that rose to prominence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Originating from Germany, the Schiff family gained significant influence in American banking through figures like Jacob H. Schiff, a partner at Kuhn, Loeb & Co. Jacob Schiff played a crucial role in financing major U.S. railroads and supporting Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. The Schiff family was also involved in philanthropic efforts, particularly in Jewish causes and institutions. Their legacy is marked by contributions to finance, politics, and philanthropy.

The Schiff and Rothschild families were closely linked through shared heritage and proximity, particularly in the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt during the 19th century. Both families resided in the Judengasse (Jew's Alley), the Jewish quarter of Frankfurt, which was notorious for its cramped conditions and restrictive policies towards Jewish inhabitants.

The Rothschilds' family home, known as the House of the Green Shield (zum Grünen Schild), became their business center as well as their residence. Mayer Amschel Rothschild started his banking empire from this home, and it became a symbol of the family’s growing financial influence. The Schiff family, also of Jewish banking lineage, lived in the same home and had close connections with the Rothschilds. Jacob Schiff, a key figure in the Schiff family, grew up in this environment and later became a powerful banker in his own right, forging strong ties with the Rothschilds through their shared business and cultural roots.

The Schiff family’s ties with the Rothschilds were not only social but also professional, as Jacob Schiff’s career path in the banking world paralleled that of the Rothschilds, with both families contributing to international finance. Schiff’s later involvement in Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in New York and his support for global causes echoed the Rothschild legacy in Europe. This connection was reflected in the mutual respect and shared Jewish identity between the two families, who both played significant roles in shaping financial markets during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
