Globex Trading System


# Globex Trading System



The **Globex Trading System** is an electronic trading platform for trading both futures contracts and options contracts that is operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

It was introduced in 1992 and was the first global electronic trading platform designed to handle trading of financial derivatives using electronic trading. It was developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) along with other technology companies and it was designed to work with the existing open outcry system at the exchange to help improve efficiencies and extend the hours of trading. Globex, or "CME Globex", offers trading approximately 23 hours a day, five days a week.


## History

In 1987 work began on the design of a new electronic system with the goal of enhancing futures trading at the CME. The system had gone through many iterations and enhancements throughout the next five years until 1992 when the first electronic futures trading began on the new system. When Globex was first launched, it ran on Reuters technology.

The system was also the first international electronic trading system to allow "off-hours trading in exchange contracts" and because of this the system was known early on as a "Pre/Post Market Trading" system.
