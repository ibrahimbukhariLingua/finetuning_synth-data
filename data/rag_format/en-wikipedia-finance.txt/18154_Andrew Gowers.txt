**Andrew Gowers** (born 1957) was appointed editor of the *Financial Times* in October 2001. He resigned from this post in November 2005 citing "strategic differences". In March 2012 he was appointed Director of External Relations at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME).

## Gowers Review of Intellectual Property

On Friday, 2 December 2005, he was commissioned by Gordon Brown to lead an independent review of intellectual property rights in the UK, known as the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. Amongst other things, this review was set up to consider the implications of extending the copyright on sound recordings in the UK.


## Lehman Brothers

In June 2006 Gowers joined Lehman Brothers in London as head of corporate communications, and stayed until the late 2008 collapse of the firm — one of the key events of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In December 2008, *The Times* published his account of this period, in which he describes Lehman CEO Richard Fuld as "almost unbearably intense" and "insulated from the day-to-day realities of the firm".
