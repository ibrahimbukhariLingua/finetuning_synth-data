## The first business school in Belarus

The demand for highly skilled Business specialists during the dawn of the market economy in Belarus led to the creation of the first business school. However, at that time, the Belarusian education system was not as equipped compared to the universities in developed countries. SBMT BSU modeled courses after these international schools of Business while fitting the program to realism of the Belarusian economy. Within the first years of operation, every member of the SBMT BSU faculty underwent advanced training in the USA and returned home to develop curriculums for their own programs.

For the first six years, courses were conducted in English only. The reasons for this are that the professors were trained in English, the teaching materials available at that time were written in English and time was needed for translation, and the English proficiency was attractive for those wanting a modern business education. Wishing to further other educational establishments, regional offices of international companies were started all over Belarus, creating joint ventures between the schools and businesses. Throughout the years, various courses have been taught by international specialists as well as by visiting professors from France, Sweden, and the US.

Today SBMT BSU offers bachelor's degrees in Russian and English languages, "Logistics", and "Management of Informational Resources". Master of Business Administration degree programs are also available. For top managers and specialists, Advanced Training and Professional Skill Improvement opportunities exist in the high priority fields of scientific and innovational activities, which are carried out within the framework of Belarus' state program of Innovational Development.(in Russian)
