The Call (American TV program)


# The Call (American TV program)



***The Call*** is an American television business news program which aired on CNBC between 11 am to 12 noon ET weekdays from August 2007 to October 2011. Previous programs shown in the same time slot were *The Money Wheel* with Ted David and Martha MacCallum and *Market Watch* and *Morning Call*. *The Call* offered a clear focus on real-time market coverage at the heart of the trading day.


## About the program

Until July 19, 2007, CNBC aired *Morning Call* from 10AM to 12 noon ET weekdays. The next day, CNBC replaced the first hour of the two-hour program with an expanded *Squawk on the Street*, due in part to Liz Claman's departure from the network (she joined the Fox Business Network three months later). The program was completely revamped on July 23, 2007, and renamed *The Call* on August 7, 2007, with Dylan Ratigan and Trish Regan serving as interim anchors. Ratigan (live from the New York Stock Exchange), Regan and Melissa Francis were appointed permanent co-anchors as of October 8, 2007. In addition to the aforementioned July 2007 revamp, the anchors were joined on set by a guest contributor, very similar to *Squawk Box*.

Dylan Ratigan left *The Call* in late 2008 as he was replaced with Larry Kudlow. Melissa Francis and Trish Regan both remained on the program, with Francis anchoring alongside Kudlow at the network's Englewood Cliffs studio and Regan anchoring at the NYSE. Ratigan ultimately left CNBC altogether in March 2009. Trish Regan departed from CNBC 2 years later (March 2011). Amanda Drury (formerly of CNBC Asia) replaced Regan as co-host until she left for *Street Signs* in mid-2011.

Regular reporters included Bob Pisani (NYSE), Scott Wapner (NASDAQ), Sharon Epperson (NYMEX), Rick Santelli (Chicago), Steve Liesman, David Faber and Brian Shactman.
