### Berkshire Hathaway

Prior to his abrupt resignation in March 2011, Sokol was widely regarded as the likely successor to Warren Buffett. Often referred to as Buffett's Mr. Fix-It, Sokol was tasked with rescuing underperforming Berkshire divisions Johns Manville and NetJets. Under Sokol's leadership Johns Manville was brought back on track and NetJets swung from a $157 million loss in 2009 to a $207 million gain in 2010.

Sokol was also integral in the selection of acquisition targets at Berkshire. In 2008, Sokol flew to China to research car manufacturer BYD, which resulted in Berkshire acquiring a $230 million stake. This position was worth over $1.5 billion in 2010. Later in 2008, Sokol engineered the acquisition of Constellation Energy for $4.7 billion, sparing the company from bankruptcy.


#### Lawsuits

In April 2010, a Douglas County judge found that Sokol, who was the CEO of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, decided to change future profit calculations in such a way that it eliminated the stake in a 1990s Philippines project for San Lorenzo Ruiz Builders & Developers Group. The judge said that Sokol and MidAmerican had acted "willfully and intentionally". The court levied a $32 million ruling against MidAmerican. This ruling may be worth $140 million in future profits.

In a second case, courts in San Francisco and Omaha ruled against MidAmerican for a total of $52 million in past profits, while also restoring ownership to La Prairie and San Lorenzo. These rights could amount to $280 million in future profits.

The third lawsuit for $150 million alleges that Sokol "secretly resumed negotiations" that led to a lower projected profit.


#### Resignation and Lubrizol-related share activity

Sokol purchased 96,060 shares of Lubrizol at a limit price of $104 per share between January 5 and 7, 2011. He presented the idea of Berkshire's acquiring Lubrizol to Buffett on January 14 or 15, 2011, and again after a January 25 meeting with Lubrizol's CEO. Berkshire Hathaway's board voted to acquire Lubrizol at $135 per share on March 13, 2011.

On March 28, 2011, Sokol tendered his resignation from Berkshire Hathaway. In his press release detailing the resignation, Buffett detailed trading activity surrounding the Lubrizol acquisition, emphasizing that he did not believe anything unlawful transpired. However at the Berkshire annual meeting that year Buffett said he did not have the full facts before the initial press release was released, adding that he found Sokol's actions "inexplicable" and "inexcusable".


## Other

In 2008, he authored and self-published *Pleased But Not Satisfied*, which described his business philosophy.

Since departing Berkshire Hathaway, Sokol has been managing investments through Teton Capital, LLC, his family holding company.

In 2010, Sokol introduced Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas when the Horatio Alger Association presented Thomas the 1992 Horatio Alger Award. He has had a close personal relationship with Thomas spanning more than a decade and regularly vacations with Thomas and his wife, Ginni.


## Family

Sokol and his wife, Peggy, have a daughter, Kelly. Their son, David "DJ" Sokol, died of cancer at age 18.
