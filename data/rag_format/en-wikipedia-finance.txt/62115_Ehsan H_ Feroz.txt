## Research and work

Feroz’s major contributions have been to the governance of the financial accounting regulatory standards, the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulatory enforcement actions, institutional theory, and the governance of the public and private sector institutions. His published articles in the premier academic journals have impacted the interdisciplinary thought processes through numerous follow-up studies in accounting, finance and environmental economy, and subsequent legislative enactments. In particular, the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Section 704 Study of Enforcement Actions was preceded by the seminal contributions of Feroz, Kyung Joo Park and Victor S. Pastena.

In 1991, Feroz co-authored a paper entitled,"The Financial and Market Effects of the SEC's Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases," with Kyung Joo Park and Victor S Pastena. The paper explored the types of accounting and auditing problems which lead to enforcement actions by the SEC, the consequences of investigations on target's financial statements, and market perception of such actions by SEC. SEC's governance enforcement program is designed "to concentrate on particular problem areas and to anticipate emerging problems." After examining 224 Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases, Feroz and his co-authors described the results of investigations against 188 firms. According to their results, the SEC "most often pursued overstatements of accounts receivable and inventories resulting from premature revenue recognition and delayed write-off, respectively." The income effects of these financial disclosure violations averaged more than 50% of reported income. They found that disclosing these reporting violations changed the "expectations of target’s future earnings as reflected in financial analysts’ reduced earnings estimated after the disclosures."

Feroz’s article with Vivian L. Carpenter entitled, "Institutional Theory and Accounting Rule Choice: Analyses of the Four US State Government’s Decisions to Adopt Generally Accepted Accounting Principles," analyzed four US state governments’ decisions to adopt generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for external financial reporting. In this research, he and his coauthor developed the institutional theory to explain how institutional pressures exerted on the four US state governments influenced the decisions of these governments to adopt or resist the use of GAAP for external financial reporting. The authors identified resource dependency on the government bonds market as a potent form of coercive institutional pressure that was associated with early GAAP adoptions. The main contribution of this study are the articulation of the sources of institutional pressures that affect the choice of accounting governance practices by state governments, and the identification of conditions under which resource dependency has its greatest influence as an effective coercive institutional pressure for changing accounting governance rule choices in the public sector. The authors also demonstrate that the power with which institutional pressures can influence governance practices vary over time, given the set of actors in place and their initial strategic response to institutional pressure for change. They also documented that there can be significant variation in the presence and effect of institutional pressures over time based on constantly changing endogenous and exogenous factors, including cognitive beliefs of the organizational decision makers.<ref.Carpenter, Vivian L.; Feroz, Ehsan H.

Inspired by Coase’s theory of the firm (1937), Feroz’s article with Sungsoo Kim and Raymond Raab entitled, "Financial Statement Analysis: A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach," demonstrated that Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) can augment the traditional ratio analysis especially, if the goal is to provide a consistent and reliable measure of the firm-specific production or managerial efficiencies of a firm. The authors empirically demonstrated their case by using time series data from the oil and gas, pharmaceutical, and primary metals industries. Feroz’s recent research topics include the governance of the financial accounting regulatory standards (scholarly monograph in-progress), and textual and contextual analysis of the US SEC's governance enforcement pronouncements.
