An **economic union** is a type of trade bloc which is composed of a common market with a customs union. The participant countries have both common policies on product regulation, freedom of movement of goods, services and the factors of production (capital and labour) as well as a common external trade policy. When an economic union involves unifying currency, it becomes an economic and monetary union.

The purposes for establishing an economic union normally include increasing economic efficiency and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries.

Economic union is established through trade pact.
