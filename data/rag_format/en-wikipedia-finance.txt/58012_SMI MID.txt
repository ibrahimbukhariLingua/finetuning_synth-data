SMI MID


# SMI MID



The **SMI MID** (**SMIM**) is a stock index which lists Switzerland's mid-cap companies. The index is calculated by SIX Swiss Exchange.

It includes the 30 Prime Standard shares from sectors that rank immediately below the companies included in the Swiss Market Index. The company size is based on terms of order book volume and market capitalization.

The SMI MID was introduced on 15 November 2004, computed back to 3 January 1996 with a baseline value of 1000 points as of 31 December 1999. Its composition is examined once a year. Calculation takes place in real-time: as soon as a new transaction occurs in a security contained in the SMI MID, an updated index level is calculated and displayed.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2020, the SMI MID, along with other SIX indices, was endorsed under the EU Benchmarks Regulation and is registered with the European Securities and Markets Authority, which means that it can be used as an underlying for financial products sold in the EU.
