# Kept.pro



**kept.pro** is a California-based American professional services firm specialized in outsourced accounting services. The firm typically works with SMEs whose revenue falls between US$5 million and US$50 million.

The company came to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of efforts by American companies to restructure their organizational workflows in response to challenges presented by the pandemic.


## Overview

The company was founded in 2020 by James Wheeler. While working as a fractional CFO, Wheeler noticed that many SMEs had revenue large enough to require robust accounting processes, yet lacked the budget to maintain a full-time, in-house accounting team. The company was formed with the intention of filling this gap.

The company's services were initially well-received in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic as many companies moved toward remote teams and struggled to minimize expenses in response to sharp decreases in revenue. By 2022, the firm exceeded US$1 million in annual recurring revenue.

In addition to fractional accounting services, kept.pro provides educational resources and strategic advisory services relating to best practices for fractional accounting functions and fractional CFOs. Educational materials cover topics such as financial statement literacy, technology, and SME-appropriate policy, aiming to use fractional accounting services as a strategic tool for growth.
