# EuroSpin



**EuroSpin** (Italian: ***Sp**esa **in**telligente*, lit.â€‰'Smart expense') is an Italian company in the large-scale retail trade of food and consumer goods in the discount chain present in Italy, Slovenia, Croatia and Malta. In 2025, EuroSpin will open its first market in Serbia.


## History

EuroSpin was founded in 1993 on the initiative of four families of entrepreneurs already active in the large-scale retail trade: the Pozzis of the Lombard Dugan, the Mions of the Veronese Migross, the Odorizzis of the Trentino cooperative Dao, and the Barbons of the Treviso-based Vega. The group, the first Italian-owned discount chain, initially used the franchising formula and then began to open its own stores.

In 2004 the brand landed in Slovenia, in 2020 in Croatia and in 2024 in Malta.

Since 2009 it has also been involved in the sale of travel with the EuroSpin Viaggi brand.
