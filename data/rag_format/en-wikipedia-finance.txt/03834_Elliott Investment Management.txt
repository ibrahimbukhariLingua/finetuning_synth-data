Elliott Investment Management


# Elliott Investment Management



**Elliott Investment Management L.P.** is an American investment management firm. It is also one of the largest activist funds in the world.

It is the management affiliate of American hedge funds Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International Limited. The Elliott Corporation was founded by Paul Singer, who is CEO of the management company, based in New York City. As of the first quarter of 2015, Elliott's portfolio is worth over $8 billion.

By 2009, over a third “of Elliott's portfolio was concentrated in distressed securities, typically in the debt of bankrupt or near-bankrupt companies."

In October 2020 Singer announced that his firm was relocating its headquarters to West Palm Beach, Florida.


## Overview

Singer created Elliott Associates in January 1977, starting with $1.3 million from friends and family and choosing the Elliott brand as it is his middle name. In its earliest years, the firm focused on convertible arbitrage. Since the 1987 stock market crash and early 1990s recession, however, the firm has transitioned into a multi-strategy hedge fund. Elliott Associates manages $8.6 billion and is Elliott Management's primary domestic fund.

The firm is currently closed to new investors. As of mid-2024, Elliott counted 570 employees in New York City, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong and is one of the oldest hedge funds under continuous management.

In a November 2014 investment letter, Elliott described optimism about U.S. growth as unwarranted. "Nobody can predict how long governments can get away with fake growth, fake money, fake jobs, fake financial stability, fake inflation numbers and fake income growth," Elliott wrote. "When confidence is lost, that loss can be severe, sudden and simultaneous across a number of markets and sectors."

In 2015, Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Elliott an A grade and the #9 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.


## Equity partners

Elliott has seven equity partners. Paul Singer and Jonathan Pollock are co-chief investment officers; Gordon Singer, Paul Singer's son, manages Elliott's London office. Former senior portfolio manager Steven Kasoff, whose retirement was announced in April 2020, was named an equity partner in January 2015. Steve Cohen, Dave Miller, Jesse Cohn and Zion Shohet are also listed as equity partners at the firm, as of November 2020.ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

## Investments


### Early activities

Early in its history, Elliott focused on convertible arbitrage, refocusing primarily on distressed debt investing following the 1987 stock market crash and early 1990s recession. Elliott is known for restructuring such U.S. firms as TWA, MCI, WorldCom, and Enron as well as overseas companies including Telecom Italia SpA and Elektrim.


### Twitter

In February 2020, Elliott Management, with about $2 billion in shares, nominated three directors to the board of Twitter Inc. *The Wall Street Journal* then reported that Singer wants to replace Jack Dorsey, due to Dorsey's workload as CEO of both Twitter and Square, and his potential move to Africa. In April 2021, Elliott's directors planned to step down from the board after Twitter's stock performance rose 95% in 2020.

Elliott's February 2020 purchase of Twitter stock was at a per share price of about $36. Elliott exited Twitter in June 2022 shortly after Elon Musk made his tender offer, when the share price was dynamic in the mid to high $45–$50 range, giving Elliott a gain over two years of approximately 33% on the investment.


### Wella AG

In 2003, Elliott believed P&G was not offering a fair price to all preferred shareholders for the German hair products company Wella AG. Elliott joined other funds in opposing the deal, including Germany's second-largest fund manager, Deka Investments. After several years of legal and shareholder battles, P&G raised its offer for Wella AG for all preferred shareholders. According to the *Börsen-Zeitung*, Elliott said its goal was to "protect the rights of minority shareholders."


### Shopko

In April 2005, the Wisconsin-based retail chain Shopko announced that it had agreed to be acquired for approximately $1 billion by a private equity firm at a price of $24 per share. This and a subsequent offer at $25 were rejected, according to the *Milwaukee Business Journal*, "after several dissident shareholders threatened to vote down the transaction, claiming the bid was too low." Elliott joined other hedge funds in opposing the sale because it felt the price was too low and because it had concerns about conflicts of interest on the board. Elliott eventually participated in purchasing ShopKo at $29 per share.


### Adecco

The human resource consulting company Adecco announced in January 2006 it had secured a 35 percent stake in DIS AG, at a price of €54.5 per share, making an offer at that price for all shares.

Eventually Adecco offered €113 per share, which was accepted.

In January 2013, Elliott called on Hess to sell certain assets and asked Hess investors to vote for five new directors as part of an effort to reconfigure the oil firm and thus boost its share price. "Buried within Hess Corp. is one of the premier U.S. resource play-focused companies," Elliott wrote.

In March, Hess announced that it was acting on some of Elliott's suggestions, but Elliott said that Hess's changes fell far short of what was needed. In April, it was reported that Hess would close its London office on Elliott's advice. Hess has been a "top pick" for Elliott since 2013. As of the fourth quarter of 2014, Elliott owned 17.8 million shares of Hess, worth $1.3 billion, making it Elliott's largest holding.

Brice Mackosso, a campaigner for greater transparency and against corruption in the Congo Republic's government, stated that if it were not for funds like Elliott, "we would not know any facts about the way our country's wealth is being taken away." After Elliott's investigations produced evidence of corruption, the government settled for an estimated $90 million on debt for which Elliott paid less than $20 million.
