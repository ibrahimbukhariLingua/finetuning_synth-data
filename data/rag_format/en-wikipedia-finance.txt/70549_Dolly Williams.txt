### New York City Planning Commission

In 2002, Williams was appointed to the New York City Planning Commission by Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz. As a member of the Commission (and the only appointee from Brooklyn), she was involved with reviewing and voting on development and land use in New York City, including the controversial Atlantic Yards proposal for downtown Brooklyn, a project which would include a new arena for the New Jersey Nets.

In 2004, it was revealed that Williams had invested a million dollars in real estate developer Bruce Ratner's purchase of the New Jersey Nets. Williams subsequently announced that she would recuse herself from any further decisions about the Atlantic Yards project.

In 2007, Williams was fined $4,000 by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board for voting in support of Atlantic Yards while at the same time investing in the project. Borough President Marty Markowitz declined to reappoint Williams to the Planning Commission and named Shirley McRae as her successor.
