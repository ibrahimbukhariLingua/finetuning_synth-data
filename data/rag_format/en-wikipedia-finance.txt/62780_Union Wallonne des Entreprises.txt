Union Wallonne des Entreprises


# Union Wallonne des Entreprises



The **Walloon Union of Companies** or **Union Wallonne des Entreprises** (UWE) is the Walloon employers organization.


## History

About 1965, when economic decentralization was becoming more pronounced in Belgium, Walloon business leaders felt the need for more organisation. The pioneers of the UWE, were, to name a few, Jules Delruelle (Prayon), George Halbart (Magotteaux), George Henry (Glaverbel), Pierre Holoffe (Asphaltco), Leon Jacques (Carri√®res de Quenast) Jean Lannoye (Papeteries de Genval), Jules Plaquet (Compagnie des Ciments Belges), Alfred Putzeys (Pieux Franki).

Together they decided, at the end of 1967, to invite a hundred company managers to a meeting, the result of which was to create the *Walloon Union of Companies* (rather than the *Union of Walloon Companies*), in this way allowing the many foreign companies established in the Walloon Area to join the organization. It is also decided to open the organization to both the industrial and non-industrial sectors. The FEB (Federation of the Companies of Belgium) had not been established at that point and the national organization was based on a *Federation of the Industrialists of Belgium* and a *Federation of the non-industrial companies of Belgium*.

Following this first meeting, it was decided to set up a Board of Directors and gather some initial funding. The new organization was founded on 2 April 1968. The first general meeting, in 1969, took place at the *Charleroi Institute of Glass*.
