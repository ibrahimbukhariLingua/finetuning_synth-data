Werthein family


# Werthein family



**Grupo Werthein** (*Werthein Group*) is an holding company founded in 1928 and based in Argentina, led by members of the Werthein family since its origins.

Born dedicated to agribusiness, food, beverages and insurance sectors in Argentina, the holding company has expanded both in Argentina and throughout the adjacent regions, diversifying its investment portfolio since 2003. The group controls a media tech company with entertainment, information and connectivity services, and has expanded its business ecosystem with real estate development, insurance, health, technology, food and beverage and human capital development.

The Group employs more than 8,200 direct collaborators and has a network of around 35,000 partners in the region.


## History

In 1904 Leon Werthein, a merchant from Bessarabia, decided to leave the Russian Empire due to the hostility towards the Jewish people. His destination was Argentina. A year later, his wife, Ana Jajam, arrived with their four children: Gregorio, Elisa, Numo and Israel. In Argentina, the couple had four more children: Abraham, Fany, Noel and Julio.
In the town of Ingeniero White, Bahía Blanca, Buenos Aires Province, León Werthein worked in the port: first as a stevedore, then as a foreman. Then, he settled in Salliqueló, where he opened a general store. The next step was to move to Miguel Riglos, in Atreucó, La Pampa, where, together with his sons, he opened another general store in 1917. León Werthein died in 1935 and his descendants continued the family business.


## Foundation

Although León and his sons began working and trading upon their arrival in Argentina, the Werthein Group formally originated in 1928 in the town of Miguel Riglos, where Gregorio, Numo and Noel founded the agricultural company that bears their names: "Gregorio, Numo y Noel Werthein S.A." (GNNW). This firm would set the beginning of the family business in a sector in which the company grew, endures and continues to be a fundamental part of the holding in the 21st century. Already in the first half of the 20th century, the family diversified its business and some members ventured into the hotel sector: in Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires, Carhué and Río Hondo.

Noel, Numo, Julio and Leo Werthein founded different companies:

* **Noel and Numo Werthein** co-founded Tel Aviv University in 1968, together with George S. Wise.
* **Noel Werthein** was president of the Argentine-Israeli Chamber of Commerce.
* **Gregorio Werthein** was president of Banco Israelita del Río de la Plata, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
* **Julio Werthein**, León's youngest son, was responsible for the family's entry into the financial sector, with the acquisition of Banco Mercantil in 1963, which laid the foundations for the Group's future activity in the sector. He was also president of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange (2002-2005) and of CICYP (Inter-American Council of Commerce and Production). Julio passed away in 2013.
* **Leo Werthein**, Noel's son, played an important role in the expansion of the agribusiness, after taking an interest in and significantly collaborating with the Werthein family's contribution to the development of livestock genetics. In 1979 he began to manage "Gregorio, Numo y Noel Werthein S.A." (GNNW). He was president of the Argentine Angus Association, director of the Rural Society of Argentina and president of the Tzedaká Foundation, thus becoming a reference of the group until his death in 2005.

## Growth and expansion

Although since the 1930s the Werthein family has been engaged in several businesses, during the last two decades of the twentieth century, with the third and fourth generation of the family in business, the Group merged production and services.
Today, it includes agribusiness, mass consumption, insurance, health, food and beverages, real estate, technology, telecommunications and entertainment. The Group is still controlled by members of the Werthein family, with Darío, Daniel and Adrián as shareholders, while other members of the family, such as Gregorio, Lucas and Andrés, are part of the new generation of directors.

He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, was President of the Latin American Jewish Congress (CJL) and is a member of the Executive Committee of the World Jewish Congress.
