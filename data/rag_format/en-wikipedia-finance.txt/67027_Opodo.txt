## Products and services


### Opodo Prime

Opodo Prime has been named the leading online travel agent subscription service in the UK. Launched in 2017, it was dubbed the ‘Netflix of travel’ due to its subscription-based pricing model.

The Opodo Prime subscription offers additional discounts on all flights as well as up to 50% off on over two million accommodation options.

Membership to Opodo Prime costs £69.99 a year, and subscribers are reported to save an average of £215 for a week's holiday including flights and accommodation. Opodo Prime discounts can be used for up to 9 people on the same booking, across both flights and hotels.


### Opodo Prime hotels

Opodo launched Prime hotels as part of its Prime subscription service in June 2020. For the same yearly subscription fee, 2.1 million accommodation options with up to 50% off were added to Opodo Prime.


### Flight price index dashboard

In June 2020, Opodo unveiled its flight price index dashboard for the UK market.

The service compares current flight prices with prices of the previous year, to suggest the optimum time to book flights. The dashboard uses over 14 billion data touch points from 660 airlines to generate year-on-year price comparisons.

The price tracker dashboard uses AI-technology and gives customers more transparency over airline prices, thus helping them make informed decisions before purchasing a flight.

Opodo plan to include a price prediction functionality in the future.


## IPO

Opodo's parent company eDreams went public in 2014.

Independent board member James Hare (James Otis Hare II) oversaw the public launch on April 4, 2014.

eDreams offered its stock at 10.25 Euros per share.

That stock price had fallen to 1.02 Euros by October 24 of 2014, wiping out over one billion Euros of market capitalization.

Some commentators called the launch “Europe’s worst performing IPO of 2014”.

eDreams moved quickly, asking their shareholders for authorization to “Discharge to Mr. James Otis Hare for the exercise of his mandate as director of the Company until his resignation as of 25 March, 2015.”

In June 2015, CEO Dana Dunne introduced a new strategy focusing on mobile, revenue diversification and customer experience improvements, which led to a strong turnaround in business performance.


## Criticism


### Poor customer service

The UK consumer association "Which?" recommends members not to use Opodo. The majority of customer complaints focus on a serious lack of responsiveness from the Opodo customer care team, for instance not receiving a reply to an email in over a month, for them being "unreachable by phone," as well as many instances in which tickets booked and confirmed through Opodo are never actually reserved with the airline. In 2020 *The Observer* gave Opodo an award for the year's "worst customer service" after it began charging customers £16.49 to receive confirmation emails, "speedy" refunds and "free customer service".


### Involvement in Israeli settlements

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of all business enterprises involved in certain specified activities related to the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Golan Heights. Opodo and its parent company, EDreams ODIGEO, have been listed on the database in light of their involvement in activities related to "the provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements". The international community considers Israeli settlements built on land occupied by Israel to be in violation of international law.
