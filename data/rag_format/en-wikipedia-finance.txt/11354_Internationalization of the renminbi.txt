Internationalization of the renminbi


# Internationalization of the renminbi



Since the late-2000s, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has sought to internationalize its official currency, the Renminbi (RMB). RMB internationalization accelerated in 2009 when China established the dim sum bond market and expanded Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity. The RMB was the 8th-most-traded currency in the world in 2013 and the 7th-most-traded in early 2014.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

The launch of Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect (SSE and HKEx) in November 2014 embarked China upon the next stage of internationalization. In January 2015, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced a planned second Stock Connect linking Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges. China's RMB internationalization and foreign exchange (FX) reforms are evolving rapidlyʷʰᵉⁿ? and full convertibility is expected over the next couple of years. In 2014, Hong Kong removed the conversion limit of 20,000 RMB per day for its residents.


## History

Until the early years of the 21st century, the Renminbi was not fully convertible and its flow in and out of China faced heavy restrictions. Under instructions from the Chinese government, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) began the move to full convertibility beginning around 2008. This has taken the form of permitting the use of RMB outside China for all current account transactions such as commercial trade, payment of services, interest payment, dividend payment, etc. and the use of RMB for certain approved capital account transactions such as foreign direct investment (FDI) and outward direct investment (ODI). Central banks and offshore Participating banks can invest excess RMB in the mainland interbank bond market through the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM quota), invest into mainland China (through the RQFII quota), invest into offshore from mainland (through the QDII quota), including the onshore individual investment to offshore through the Qualified Domestic Individual Investors program (so-called QDII2).

According to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the path of RMB internationalisation can be divided into three phases—first as usage for trade finance, then for investment, and in the longer term, as reserve currency.

Before 2004, the yuan was not allowed outside of China. In 2004, China started to allow border trading in yuan, especially in the Southern and Western border. HKMA first raised with the PBoC the idea of introducing personal renminbi business in Hong Kong as early as November 2001, to facilitate economic and social exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland and to channel renminbi cashnotes in Hong Kong back to the Mainland orderly through the banking system. In November 2003, the State Council approved the introduction of personal renminbi business in Hong Kong, which was followed by the appointment of the Clearing Bank, and establishment of payment system linkages and arrangements for cross-border renminbi cashnote delivery. Banks in Hong Kong started to offer renminbi deposit-taking, currency exchange, remittance and debit and credit card services to personal accounts on 25 February 2004. As of May 2014ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, 1.47% of world payments was settled in RMB, which ranked RMB as the 7th most traded currency in the world. The average monthly RMB trade settlement rose from CN¥320 billion in 2013 to ¥480bn in 2014.


### 2007: Creation of *Dim Sum* bonds and offshore RMB bond market

The dim sum bond market generally refers to RMB-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong. The majority of dim sum bonds are denominated in CNH, but some are linked to CNY (but paid in USD). In July 2007, dim sum bonds worth a total of US$657 million were issued for the first time by the China Development Bank. These financial assets were issued to foreign investors in renminbi, rather than the local currency.

In June 2009, China allowed financial institutions in Hong Kong to issue dim sum bonds. HSBC was the first institution that issued these. In August 2010, McDonald was the first corporation that issued dim sum bonds. In October, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) raised a ¥1.2bn 10-year bond, and became the first supranational agency which issued dim sum bonds and also the first issuer listed in the HKSE. The dim sum bond market grew 2.3 times from 2010 (¥35.8bn) to 2013 (¥116.6bn), with an outstanding amount at the end of 2013 of RMF 310bn.

In August 2012, China and Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding on new cross-strait currency settlement, and in March 2013, China Trust Commercial Bank became the first to issue RMB bonds in the Taiwan market (Formosa bond). In November, CCB (Hong Kong) issued a Formosa bond after mainland banks became eligible.


### 2008: Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project

Source:

Phase I: on 24 December 2008, China allowed import and export in RMB between (i) Yunnan province and countries in GMS including ASEAN countries (ii) Guangdong province and Hong Kong and Macau.

Phase II: on 1 July 2009, China officially announced regulation on the RMB Settlement Pilot Project and opened up Shanghai and four cities in Guangdong (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Dongguan) with Hong Kong, Macau and ASEAN countries.

On 1 July 2010, it expanded to Mainland Designated Enterprises (MDE) in 20 pilot areas (4 municipalities [Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai], 12 provinces [Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jilin, Heilongjiang] and 4 autonomous regions [Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjing Uygur, Tibet]), which allow cross border payments of current account items with any country in the world.

By 2014, RMB cross-border trade settlements reached RMB 5.9 trn making a 42.6% (year-over-year) increase, which represents 22% of China's trading volume.


### 2009: Offshore Renminbi (CNH)

Since 2009, China has signed currency swap agreements with numerous countries and regions such as Argentina, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, ECB, Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The renminbi deposits in HK gradually grew from ¥12 billion in 2004 to ¥59 billion in 2009.

On **17 August 2010**, PBoC issued a policy to allow Central Banks, RMB offshore Clearing Banks and offshore Participating Banks to invest excess RMB in debt securities or in the onshore Inter-bank Bond Market. In October, China further opened up both FDI and ODI in RMB (Pilot RMB Settlement of Outward Direct Investment) and nominated Xinjiang as the first pilot province (which, in early 2011, expanded to 20 pilot areas). In November 2010, China and Russia began trading in their own currencies, abandoning the United States dollar as the medium of exchange in bilateral trade. This was soon followed by Japan in December 2011. On 19 December, the direct trading of yuan against Thai baht was launched in CFETS (Interbank FX trading system) in Yunnan and on 31 December, PBC released the *Announcement of the People’s Bank of China Concerning the Implementation of Measures for the Pilot Program of Allowing Fund Management Companies and Securities Companies Approved as Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) to Invest in Domestic Securities Market.* The RQFII program allows RMB investment funds to be set up in Hong Kong and invest in mainland China's securities markets.

In the first quarter of **2011**, the Renminbi surpassed the Russian rouble in terms of international trading volume for the first time in history.


### 2013: Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ)

In June 2013, the United Kingdom became the first G-7 country to set up an official currency swap line with China.

The Shanghai Free-Trade Zone (SFTZ) was launched on 29 September 2013 with key implementation details announced in May 2014. The SFTZ was being used as a test ground for trade, investment and financial reforms, before the roll out to nationwide. The RMB can flow freely between Free Trade Accounts (FTA), non-resident onshore accounts and offshore accounts. Transactions between resident onshore accounts outside SFTZ and FTA with the same entity are also allowed, provided they do not involve capital account transactions that are not yet approved by PBoC and SAFE.

As of 2013, the RMB is the 8th most traded currency in the world.

As of **July 2014**, 25 countries have signed the RMB Bilateral Swap Agreement with PBoC with total facilities of over ¥2.7 trillion.

The scale of the offshore renminbi (CNH) market is still limited at the moment, with offshore renminbi deposits (around ¥1.5 trillion, of which 70% are in Hong Kong) only about 1% of that onshore (around ¥100 trillion), which is much lower than the ratio of 30% of offshore versus onshore US dollar deposits. The average daily turnover of offshore renminbi foreign exchange market (CNH) was about US$20 billion by the end of 2013. On 17 November, synchronised with the Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect debut, the HKMA has lifted the daily yuan conversion cap (¥20,000).


### 2016: Cross Border Financing

Effective from 3 May 2016, PBoC expanded its pilot program for macro prudential management of cross-border financing from FTZ to nationwide.


### 2019: QFII and RQFII lifted

In September 2019, SAFE announced that the QFII (launched 2002) and RQFII (since 2011) quotas are revoked. RMB's share as a global payment currency ranked #5 as of August 2019 with market share of 2.22% preceding by USD (42.52%), EUR (32.06%), GBP (6.21%) and JPY (3.61%)


### 2020: QFII and RQFII merged

In September 2020, PBOC and SAFE announced that the QFII and RQFII, the two major inbound investment programs, will be combined starting in November. Other changes include simplified application, shorten review cycle, no restriction on intermediary, reduced data submission requirements and expanded scope of investment. Separately SAFE granted additional US$3.36 billion to 18 institutions under QDII scheme, bringing the total scheme to US$107.34 billion between 157 institutions.


### RMB as a reserve currency

The road to the RMB Internationalization is far from complete.

* First, the size of the home economy must be large relative to others.
* Second, economic stability in the form of low inflation, small budget deficits and stable growth is also important. China's record of supportive government policies and macro-economic stability has undoubtedly contributed to the RMB's appeal in recent years. The bursting of Japan's bubble in the early 1990s was arguably one of the main reasons why yen internationalization stalled.
* Third, strong official and institutional support. This was an important reason for the dollar's adoption as a global currency after the Second World War, formalised through the Bretton Woods system. China has been doing that in the last few years, promoting the use of RMB and its infrastructure with ASEAN, Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, etc. At the China Development Forum in March 2014, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) stressed the importance of strengthening financial regulations, establishing a deposit insurance scheme and improving market-driven exit mechanisms for financial institutions, while pushing forward reforms.
* Fourth, deep, open and well-regulated capital markets are necessary so the currency can be used to finance trade as well as provide a large enough market in securities for investors. The opening up of China's onshore capital market will be an important step in the RMB becoming a major investment currency. This is one area where progress has been deliberately slow. For the RMB to be a truly global and become a more widely held reserve currency there needs to be greater access for foreign investors to local capital markets, even deeper global RMB liquidity and wider cross-border flow channels.

On 14 August 2020, the People's Bank of China released the "Report on the Internationalization of RMB in 2020". The report said that RMB's function of reserve currency has gradually emerged. In the first quarter 2020, the share of RMB in global foreign exchange reserves rose to 2.02%, a record high. As of the end of 2019, the People's Bank of China has set up RMB clearing banks in 25 countries and regions outside of Mainland China, which has made the use of RMB more secure and transaction costs have decreased.


## Major milestones

* 2002, Domestic Securities Investment by Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII regulation) was announced in November allowed foreign investors to access mainland stock markets (A-shares)
* 2004, RMB deposits in Hong Kong is allowed. By the end of 2013 RMB deposits totalled ¥860 billion, an increase from ¥315 billion in 2010, which account for around 12% of total deposits in the Hong Kong banking system, up from 1% in 2008.
* 2011 (Dec), PBC released the Announcement of the People's Bank of China Concerning the Implementation of Measures for the Pilot Program of Allowing Fund Management Companies and Securities Companies Approved as Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) to Invest in Domestic Securities Market. The RQFII program allows RMB investment funds to be set up in Hong Kong and invest in mainland China's securities markets.
* In December 2013, the RMB overtook the euro to become the second most-used currency in global trade finance after the US dollar, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).
* 2014 (April), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC) announced in a joint statement a trial trading program known as Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, which will allow two-way cross-market stock investment by qualified Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong investors. The pilot program will operate between the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (SEHK), the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (ChinaClear) and the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (HKSCC). SSE and SEHK will allow investors to trade eligible shares listed on each other's markets through local securities firms or brokers.
* 2014 (May), Shanghai Free Trade Zone materialized and later (15 July), SAFE issued Circular 36 to extend benefits to foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) in other 16 industrial parks and economic zones.
* 2015 (11 Aug), PBoC improved the quotation mechanism of USD/CNY to become more market-based.
* 2015 (8 Oct), the China International Payments System (CIPS) is launched, as an alternative to SWIFT.
* 2016 (Aug), the World Bank, the first issue of SDR bonds in CIBM (SDR 500m, 3-year payable in RMB) with bid-to-cover ration of 2.47
* 2017 (16 May), PBC and HKMA jointly announced Bond Connect to enable bond trading between Mainland and HK institutional investors
* 2018 (Mar), Oil futures contract launched, denominated in yuan, on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange.
* 2020 RMB share of foreign exchange market rose to 4.3% (up 0.3% from 2016), ranked 5th globally but only used for 1.76% of payments, despite China 10% contribution of global trade in goods. More than 70 central banks and monetary authorities have already incorporated RMB into their FX reserves. PBoC said China will further facilitate cross-border use of RMB to boost trade and investment.

## Implications for the financial industry

* **Trade settlement** - The internationalization of the RMB allows foreign companies trading with mainland Chinese companies to settle the trade in RMB, thus, reducing FX cost, open up the opportunity to the larger markets and often secure better trade terms.
* **Financing and borrowing** - creation of dim sum and offshore RMB bond markets offer RMB borrows the chance to access a competitive and diversify funding sources. It is also opened up opportunities for international and retail investors.
* **Capital management** - free trade zone companies may borrow and lend funds directly with overseas (RMB cash pooling). This allows multinational companies to centrally manage their funds and make payments directly in RMB globally.

According to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), many financial institutions are currently building up an RMB trade settlement, payments, foreign exchange, derivatives and clearing capabilities because the internationalization of the RMB has led to new sources of revenue for banks.
