## History

The Moscow Commercial Institute was founded in 1907 on private donations of merchants, bankers and manufacturers, gathered at the initiative of Moscow merchant Alexei Vishnyakov. It was essentially the first institute in Russia offering higher business education in line with the then rapidly developing branches of Russian industry. Prior to the revolution of 1917, about 2,000 specialists were graduated from the institute. In 1924, it was renamed after Marxist thinker Georgi Plekhanov. In the 1960s, the institute was merged with the Moscow Governmental Economic Institute. After 1991, the institute obtained its current name. Recent years were marked with rising international cooperation, such as the foundation of the Africa Business House. Presently, the university deals with more than 80 partners in 52 countries. Among its graduates, there are many prominent politicians and businessmen, such as Soviet statesman Mikhail Suslov, liberal democrat Grigory Yavlinsky, and faculty member Ruslan Khasbulatov, former chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and later Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation (1991–1993).
