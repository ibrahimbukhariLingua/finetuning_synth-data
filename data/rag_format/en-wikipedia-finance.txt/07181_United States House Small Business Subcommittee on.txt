United States House Small Business Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access


# United States House Small Business Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access



The **House Small Business Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access** is one of five subcommittees of the House Small Business Committee and is responsible for evaluating the operation of financial markets in the United States as well as their ability to provide small businesses with the capital they need. The subcommittee also reviews federal programs, but especially those that are being overseen by the Small Business Administration which is aimed at helping assist entrepreneurs in obtaining needed business capital. Since the tax policy also plays an integral role in access to capital, the committee also examines the impact of federal tax policies on small businesses.
