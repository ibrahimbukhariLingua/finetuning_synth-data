## Products


### Potash

Mosaic has approximately 10.4 million tonnes of operational potash capacity. Mosaic currently owns potash mines or surface mills at; Belle Plaine, Colonsay, Esterhazy K1, Esterhazy K2, Esterhazy K3 and Carlsbad, with another potash mine recently purchased in Brazil during the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. Colonsay mine and mill has been indefinitely idled and is currently in care and maintenance mode. Esterhazy K3, currently in development, consists of an underground mine and service/production shafts separate from the K1 and K2 underground mine that is beginning to supply the K1 and K2 surface facilities with ore. Esterhazy K3 does not have surface milling and storage facilities, instead it is intended to replace the ore currently mined from the K1 and K2 mine. This shift in production will decrease brine management costs of the K1 and K2 mine, which stood at $108.0 million for 2020.

Mosaic is a member of Canpotex, an export association of Canadian potash producers through which they sell their Canadian potash outside the U.S. and Canada.

Potash mines are located in:

### Phosphate

Mosaic has approximately 16.8 million tonnes of operational capacity for finished concentrated phosphates. Mosaic is the largest producer of finished phosphate products with an annual capacity greater than the next two largest producers combined. It has a global distribution network made up of plants, port facilities, warehouses and sales offices. In 2013 Mosaic produced 7.6 million tons of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and over 15 million tons of phosphate rock production. In October, 2013, Mosaic reached an agreement to purchase the phosphate operations of CF Industries for 1.4 billion dollars, which eliminates the need for Mosaic to spend an additional billion dollars to build a new processing facility in Hardee County, Florida to process the rock from their mines in that area.

Phosphate mines are located in the Bone Valley Formation of the Peace River watershed in Central Florida:
