## Reception

*New Money* received mixed reviews from critics. Nollywood Reinvented referred to the movie as being "Disney-like", highlighting the lack of depth in the story as well as the over-saturation of popular music. NR, however, praised the performances in the movie. Ife Olujuyigbe of True Nollywood Stories (TNS) praised the movie for the casting, music selection and rich dialogue but criticized it for what she called 'a rather flat ending and a poster that begs for originality'. Overall, she rates the movie 80%. Ayomide Crit praised the storytelling, production and casting but was of the opinion that the storyline lacked sufficient depth. The critic also held the opinion that the directorial composition was averagely done and finally described the movie as 'just there, nothing spectacular and nothing remarkable'. Chidumga Izuzu of Pulse Nigeria praised Jemima Osunde's performance as Toun and praised the chemistry between characters, but stated that the movie is not as intense as director Oshin's previous works.
