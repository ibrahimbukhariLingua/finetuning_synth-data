Strategy+Business


# Strategy+Business



''***Strategy+Business''*** (stylized as ***strategy+business***) combines powerful insights from inside and outside PwC to define and shape the top management agenda. We seek to help leaders thrive today, reinvent for the future, and deliver sustainable value. Headquartered in New York, *strategy+business* (*s+b*) is published by member firms of the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) network.

Articles cover industry topics of interest to CEOs and other senior executives, as well as to business academics and researchers. The articles, written in English, are authored by a mix of figures from both the executive suite and academia in addition to journalists and consultants from PwC.

The magazine's founding editor-in-chief, Joel Kurtzman, coined the term *thought leadership* when he published interviews with influential business figures under the rubric “Thought Leaders.” Interviews with “Thought Leaders” remain a recurring feature on the *strategy+business* website.


## History

Before the separation of Booz & Company (now Strategy&) from Booz Allen Hamilton in 2008, *strategy+business* was published by Booz Allen Hamilton as *Strategy & Business* since its launch in 1995. Full issues of *strategy+business* appear in print and digital form every quarter, and other original material is published daily on its website.

Joel Kurtzman, formerly editor-in-chief of the *Harvard Business Review* and a business editor and columnist at *The New York Times* — together with a group of partners at Booz & Company, which was then part of Booz Allen Hamilton — founded *strategy+business* in 1995. A collection of Kurtzman's "Thought Leader" columns was published in book form as *Thought Leaders: Insights on the Future of Business* (Jossey-Bass, 1997). Kurtzman served as editor-in-chief between 1995 and 1999.

Randall Rothenberg succeeded Kurtzman, serving as editor-in-chief between 2000 and 2005. Previously, Rothenberg had been an editor of *The New York Times Magazine* and had also served as the newspaper's advertising columnist. He redesigned *strategy+business*, introduced the “Best Business Books” section, and expanded coverage of electronic media. Rothenberg's first major issue, which was published in February 2000, was titled “E-Business: Lessons from Planet Earth,” and contained articles that prophesied the dot-com crash that occurred several months later. During Rothenberg's tenure, the *strategy+business* staff was formally brought into the Booz Allen Hamilton operation; before that, the magazine had been a standalone, contracted enterprise.

By 2002, the firm's e-commerce business was not doing well, but Booz Allen's partners decided to keep publishing it. Rothenberg and Cesare Mainardi (former chief executive officer at Strategy&) developed what they called the “functional agenda.” They started to build a body of research and practice around six major functions: strategy and leadership; innovation; organizations and people; marketing and sales; mergers and restructuring; and operations. Many of the regular features in *strategy+business,* including the “Global Innovation 1000” survey of top R&D spenders and the “CEO Succession” report on CEO tenure, date back to this effort.

Art Kleiner succeeded Rothenberg in 2005 and served as editor-in-chief until January 2020. A writer, lecturer, and commentator, Kleiner is the author of *The Age of Heretics: A History of the Radical Thinkers Who Reinvented Corporate Management* (Currency/Doubleday, 1996; rev’d. ed., 2008, Jossey-Bass) and *Who Really Matters: The Core Group Theory of Power, Privilege, and Success* (Currency/Doubleday, 2003).

During Kleiner's tenure, the magazine published influential articles on neuroscience and leadership (a 2006 article by David Rock and Jeffrey Schwartz led to the establishment of the field of neuroleadership), women in emerging markets, investment in infrastructure, organizational culture, theories of economic change, and market dislocation. In 2020, financial and economic journalist Daniel Gross was named editor-in-chief.

After a private equity takeover by The Carlyle Group in 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton was split into two entities. *Strategy+business* became the flagship publication of the commercial firm, Booz & Company (now known as Strategy&). Strategy& is part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which acquired it (as Booz & Company) on April 3, 2014.
