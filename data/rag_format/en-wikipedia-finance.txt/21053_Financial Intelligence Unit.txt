# Financial Intelligence Unit



A **financial intelligence unit** (**FIU**) is a national body or government agency or international organization which collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report suspicious transactions, suspected of being money laundering or terrorism financing.


## Overview

FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies, but their mission is to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the police or public prosecutors. They complement the apparatus of administrative anti-money laundering supervision, which ensures that obliged entities transmit relevant information to the FIU.

Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) are specialized agencies responsible for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial information related to money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. They play a crucial role in the global fight against financial crime by collaborating with various stakeholders, including law enforcement, regulatory authorities, and international organizations. Here’s an overview of some prominent FIUs around the world:

1. **Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) - United States**: FinCEN is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and focuses on combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.
2. **FATF (Financial Action Task Force)**: While not an FIU itself, FATF is an international body that sets standards and promotes effective implementation of measures for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. It has a network of member countries and works closely with FIUs globally.
3. **Serious Fraud Office (SFO) - United Kingdom**: The SFO investigates and prosecutes serious and complex fraud, including financial crimes.
4. **Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)**: AUSTRAC is Australia’s financial intelligence unit and anti-money laundering regulator.
5. **Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)**: FINTRAC is Canada’s FIU, focusing on detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.
6. **Centre for Financial Crime and Security Analysis (CFCSA) - India**: CFCSA is the Indian FIU, which handles financial intelligence and investigations related to financial crimes.
7. **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) - Singapore**: The FIU in Singapore is known for its proactive approach to detecting and preventing financial crimes.
8. **European Banking Authority (EBA)**: While the EBA itself is not an FIU, it works to strengthen the regulation and supervision of financial institutions within the EU, including measures related to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.
9. **Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) - South Africa**: The FIC is responsible for collecting and analyzing financial data to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
10. **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) - Japan**: Japan's FIU works on analyzing suspicious financial transactions and enhancing the anti-money laundering framework in Japan.

These units often work in conjunction with one another, sharing information and coordinating efforts to tackle financial crimes on a global scale. They are part of a broader network of organizations and agencies committed to financial security and integrity.The Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units is the global coordination venue for FIUs.

## European Financial Intelligence Unit Network

The Financial Intelligence Unit Network (FIU.NET) is a decentralized computer network that provides an information exchange between the financial intelligence units of the European Union. FIU.NET is a decentralized system with no central database where the information is collected. All the connected FIUs have their FIU.NET equipment within their own premises and manage their own information. Through FIU.NET the connected FIUs create bilateral or multilateral cases. Ma³tch (autonomous, anonymous, analysis) is a matching tool within FIU.NET. Ma³tch makes it possible for FIUs to match names in order to find relevant data that is possessed by other connected FIUs. As the data is anonymized, there is no breaching of privacy and data protection rules.

## FIU reporting in the United States

The United States has several laws requiring the reporting to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). These include the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) of 1978, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (and other names of revisions), and the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA). Some reports also need to go to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Representative Reports required from US financial institutions
| Report and definition | Authority | Receiving Agency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Currency Transaction Report (CTR)**. Cash transactions in excess of $10,000 during the same business day. The amount over $10,000 can be either from one transaction or a combination of cash transactions. | Bank Secrecy Act | Internal Revenue Service |
| **Negotiable Instrument Log (NIL)**. Cash purchases of negotiable instruments (e.g., money orders, cashiers checks, travelers cheques) having a face value of $3,000, or more. | Bank Secrecy Act | Internal Revenue Service |
| **Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)**. Any cash transaction where the customer seems to be trying to avoid BSA reporting requirements (e.g., CTR, NIL). A SAR must also be filed if the customer's actions indicate that s/he is laundering money or otherwise violating federal criminal law. The customer must not know that a SAR is being filed. | Bank Secrecy Act | Financial Crimes Enforcement Network |

Actions that can trigger an SAR being filed include:

1. Any kind of insider abuse of a financial institution, involving any amount;
2. Federal crimes against, or involving transactions conducted through, a financial institution that the financial institution detects and that involve at least $5,000 if a suspect can be identified, or at least $25,000 regardless of whether a suspect can be identified;
3. Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involve funds from illegal activities or are structured to attempt to hide those funds;
4. Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect are designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bankruptcy Secrecy Act; or
5. Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect have no business or apparent lawful purpose or are not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage and for which the institution knows of no reasonable explanation after due investigation. The language of the RFPA indicates that a SAR filed under this rule comes from an individual transaction, not a profile of activities that make the transaction stand out.
