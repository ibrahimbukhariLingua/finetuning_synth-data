# Andreas Suchanek



**Andreas Suchanek** (born August 12, 1961, in Stadthagen, Germany) is a German economy and business ethicist and one of the best-known students of Karl Homann, an expert in business ethics.

He is an economist as well as an expert in business and economy ethics. As academic disciple of Karl Homann he contributed substantially to Homanns teaching regarding the approach of institutional economics toward business ethics, which not only plays an important part at Universities and international business schools but also in the economy, politics and the society.


## Life

Andreas Suchanek studied political economy at the University Kiel and the University Göttingen before he graduated as doctor of political science summa cum laude from the private Witten/Herdecke University in 1993. In 1999 he was habilitated at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt due to his work on normative environmental economics. Subsequently, in 1999, he was appointed as Karl Homanns successor and took over the substitution of the chair for economy and business ethics at the university's science faculty. Homann left to serve as chair for philosophy and economy at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 2004, Suchanek joined the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management (former Handelshochschule Leipzig). Since that time, he holds the Dr. Werner Jackstädt-chair for economy and business ethics.

In addition to this, since 2005, Suchanek is as member of the Wittenberg-Center for Global Ethics (Wittenberg-Zentrums für Globale Ethik) board of directors which specializes on the topics "Building Global Cooperation" and corporate social responsibility as globalization, world economy and global competition are supposed to be shaped for the benefit of all people. According to the center, this requires general principles which make peace, justice and prosperity possible in the consolidating world society. Since 2013 Suchanek is the center's chairman and vice chairman of the executive board of the foundation. The foundation was founded by former US ambassador Andrew Young and Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former German minister of foreign affairs. The idea for founding the center was inspired by Hans-Dietrich Genscher's guiding principle “winners vs. losers – that's not how the new world order should be. Everybody should have their share of the winning side. In affirming the interests of others lies a chance for oneself”. As academic leader Andreas Suchanek is responsible to develop the theoretical groundwork of the Wittenberg-Center with the aim for the guiding principle to increasingly take root in the society. A number of well-known businesses and organizations as well as important personalities from the spheres of politics, economy, church, culture and science support the Wittenberg-Center's work.

As an expert in questions of corporate social responsibility Suchanek advises global businesses from various economic branches.


## Theory

Suchanek's studies focus on economy and business ethics, sustainability, trust and credibility management as well as interaction ethics. By using decision and game theory methods, which view the question of competition and cooperation not as contradiction but as chance to win cooperation, Suchanek developed the economically reformed Golden Rule: invest in the conditions of social collaboration for mutual advantage.

Being a member of the core team of HHL - Leipzig Graduate School of Management, he developed the Leipzig Leadership Model, which was published in 2016, along with Manfred Kirchgeorg, Timo Meynhardt, Andreas Pinkwart and Henning Zülch.
