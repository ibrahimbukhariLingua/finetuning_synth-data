## Personal views

In one of his November 2011 columns in Vatan, *Monetary politics and financial stability* (in Turkish), Akat argued that developed countries led by the US used to have a monopoly on economic theories and practises. Akat believes that the global crisis has changed this radically. Developing countries such as Turkey have begun to seize the initiative. “The fatwa of one global financial centre no longer applies,” he wrote. In his interview with ESI, Akat recalls the 1980s and 1990s when Turkey and its economy were not “on anyone’s map.” He talks about the Turkish economy’s “miraculous transformation” in the last decade, about the pro-business and fiscally conservative AKP
government, and the sustainability of the country’s economic growth.


## Books and publications

He is the author of many publications and three books on economic issues. His latest, *Iktisadi Analiz* (Economic Analysis), was
published in 2009. In his paper *The Political Economy of Turkish Inflation* (2005) he
researched inflation in Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s. Until 2009 Akat was one of the faces of
Ekodiyalog, a popular television program on economics.
