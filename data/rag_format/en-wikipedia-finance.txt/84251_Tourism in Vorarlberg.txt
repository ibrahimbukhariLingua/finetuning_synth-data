Tourism in Vorarlberg


# Tourism in Vorarlberg



Vorarlberg Tourismus GmbH is a state organisation in Vorarlberg with the task of developing **tourism in Vorarlberg** and marketing the region. The company was founded in 2008 by the state of Vorarlberg and the Vorarlberg Chamber of Commerce and emerged from the Vorarlberg Tourism Association.


## History

Vorarlberg Tourism's predecessor, the Provincial Tourist Association, was founded in Dornbirn on 5 November 1893. Its tasks included summer brochures, posters and advertising. In 1902, the newly introduced statistics recorded 48,649 arrivals. The first ski lift in the Alps was opened at Bödele in 1907, and in 1923 a winter brochure and radio advertisements were produced. The first tourist film was made in 1945.

The first Vorarlberg Tourism Act was passed in 1966, and ten years later market research was carried out with a nationwide guest survey. From 1982 onwards, more overnight stays were recorded in winter than in summer.

In 2008, Vorarlberg Tourismus Ges.m.b.H. was founded and the regional association was dissolved. In 2012, the company developed the Tourism Strategy 2020 together with the state of Vorarlberg and the Vorarlberg Chamber of Commerce.
