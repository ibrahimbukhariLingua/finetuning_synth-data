## History

The organization was originally created by Presidential Decree 1080 on January 31, 1977, under the name Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation to provide guarantees and facilitate the entry of foreign loans for development projects. On February 12, 1998, its area of operation was expanded and its name accordingly changed to Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines by Republic Act No. 8494. It was re-titled again through an Executive Order 85 on March 18, 2002, to Philippine Export-Import Credit Agency (PhilEXIM).

On July 23, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the merger of the Home Guaranty Corporation and PhilEXIM to prevent operational redundancies, standardize policies, facilitate timely approvals, and lower administrative costs. The order transferred the guarantee functions, programs, and funds of the Small Business Corporation and the administration of the Agricultural Guarantee Fund Pool and the Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund to the PhilExim, the surviving entity in the amalgamation of the five Philippine Guarantee Programs and Agencies. It also authorized capital stock of the PhilExim to be increased from Php10 billion to Php50 billion while the equity contributions of the national government to the Home Guaranty Corporation, IGLF, and AGFPᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ will be transferred to the PhilExim to form part of its paid-up capital. To reflect the centralized nature of the merged guarantee functions, the PhilEXIM was renamed Philippine Guarantee Corporation.
