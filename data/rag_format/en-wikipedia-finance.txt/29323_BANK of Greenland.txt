BANK of Greenland


# BANK of Greenland



The **BANK of Greenland** (Danish: *GrønlandsBANKEN*) is one of two commercial banks in Greenland, listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange as GRLA, with 2,700 shareholders in 2017. Headquartered in Nuuk, the bank had 118 employees in 2017.


## History

The Bank of Greenland was founded on 26 May 1967 by a number of Danish banks, during the era when Greenland was still a province of Denmark. The founding banks were Privatbanken, Danske Bank, Kjøbenhavns Handelsbank, and an organization of local banks, provincial and Copenhagen-based. Operations started in Nuuk on 1 July 1967, while local branches in Ilulissat, Sisimiut, and Qaqortoq followed in 1985, and in Maniitsoq in 1989.

On 8 June 1985 the bank merged with *Nuna Bank* (formerly *Bikuben*), with the capital of 120 million Danish krone (DKK), retaining the name of Grønlandsbanken, and becoming the only commercial bank in the country.

Later, the BankNordik, which has its headquarters on the Faroe Islands, established itself as a competitor with an office in Nuuk, Greenland (BankNordik also has offices in the Faroe Islands).


## Operations

The Bank of Greenland provides commercial services, as well as products and services for private customers such as loans, specialized and automated deposits, and property trading and administration. With 50,000 customers, the Bank of Greenland has branches in major towns in Greenland, while bank operations in small settlements are handled via the integrated Post Greenland offices in the Pilersuisoq all-purpose stores.
