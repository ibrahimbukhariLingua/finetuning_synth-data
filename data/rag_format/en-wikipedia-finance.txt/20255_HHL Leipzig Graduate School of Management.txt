## The Leipzig Leadership Model

The **Leipzig Leadership Model** (LLM) is an interdisciplinary and multidimensional framework for good leadership developed at HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management in 2016. The LLM uses its four dimensions (purpose, entrepreneurial spirit, effectiveness and responsibility) to link important questions of meaning and values with the strategic and operational tasks of entrepreneurial activity. The four dimensions can be applied using key questions and guide reflection:

- Are we pursuing an overarching goal? (Purpose)

- Do we think and act entrepreneurially? (entrepreneurial spirit)

- Are our actions legitimate? (Responsibility)

- Are we effective? (Effectiveness)

Without prescribing specific instructions for action, the LLM offers orientation in order to remain capable of acting as an organization or manager in a fundamentally uncontrollable world and to develop an attitude according to which the manager sees her/himself as part of a larger whole and defines her/himself through a value contribution and not through status, knowledge or power.

In 2022 an extended version was published in which systemic interactions between entrepreneurial activity and grand challenges are given greater prominence.

In 2023, a psychometric procedure ("Leipzig Leadership Profile") was presented, with the help of which individual leadership orientations are measured in the four model dimensions. This is used in teaching and in the "New Leipzig Talents" competency coaching program.
