# Huayi Brothers



**Huayi Brothers Media Corp.** (Chinese: 华谊兄弟传媒股份有限公司; pinyin: *Huáyì Xiōngdì Chuánméi Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī*) is a Chinese multinational entertainment company that owns a film studio, a television production company, a talent agency, a record label, entertainment theme parks, and a movie theater chain founded in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, & Taipei by Dennis Wang Zhongjun and James Wang Zhonglei in 1994. The company made world news on October 30, 2009, when the Shenzhen Stock Exchange ChiNext Board was halted, after HBMC's stock price reached 122.74 percent above its IPO price, to open at 63.66 yuan per share. Patrick Frater of *Variety* called it "China’s largest private sector film conglomerate". In 2014, the company was the seventh-largest film distributor in China, with 2.26% of the market.


## History

The company was founded in 1994 as a film production company. It underwent a comprehensive expansion into the media industry through investing and now produces movies, TV shows, & music and operates a film studio, TV production company, a talent agency, a record label, and movie theaters.
In February 2011, Huayi Brothers revealed their plans to create the largest TV and film studio complex in East Asia. Also, they announced that they aim to earn 10 billion yuan in the box office by 2016. As of April 2015, the company was worth US$7.9 billion.

In 2014 the company announced that it had agreed to invest as much as $150 million in Studio 8, the production company launched by former Warner Bros. executive Jeff Robinov, but Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun International later signed a deal to invest in Robinov's company instead. The same year the company acquired 79% stake in GDC Technology Limited, a *Digital Cinema* solutions provider, which was held by private equity funds *Carlyle Group* and Yunfeng Capital.

Around 2019, after the delay of The Eight Hundred due to censorship, the company created a novel Chinese Communist Party committee so that “correct political orientation ... [would] mix the core socialist values of the party deeper into the company’s blood”.

Huayi Brothers Movie World is a theme park inspired by the Huayi Brothers' movies, television shows, celebrities, and pop culture. The park is designed to be immersive with technology, and features immersive environments that celebrate the Huayi Brothers' movies and characters. The park opened in Suzhou, China on July 22, 2018, and was the first of several planned developments in China.
