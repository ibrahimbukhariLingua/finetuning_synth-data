Association of Government Accountants


# Association of Government Accountants



The **AGA** (formerly **Association of Government Accountants**) is a professional organization for government financial management professionals. Its activities include advocacy in government financial management and working to increase government financial performance and accountability.

Based in Alexandria, Virginia, the AGA was founded in 1950 and has more than 14,000 members. In addition, the AGA grants the professional designation of Certified Government Financial Manager.


## History

In 1950, the Federal Government Accountants Association (FGAA) was founded on the initiative of Robert W. King and a group of federal accountants. In July 1975, the name was changed to the Association of Government Accountants after an overwhelming vote by its members.

In November 1990, President Bush signed into law the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which had been embodied by the AGA. The act defined the concept with the creation of the Federal Financial Management Task Force in 1983.
