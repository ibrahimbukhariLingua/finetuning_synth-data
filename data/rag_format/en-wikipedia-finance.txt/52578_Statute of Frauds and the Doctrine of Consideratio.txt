Statute of Frauds and the Doctrine of Consideration


# Statute of Frauds and the Doctrine of Consideration



***Statute of Frauds and the Doctrine of Consideration*** (1937) Cmnd 5449 was a report by the Law Revision Committee on the consideration and formality in English contract law and other areas. It did not recommend abolition of the doctrine of consideration but made a series of recommendations to overturn the existing restrictions that had been developed by some common law courts.


## Overview

The Law Revision Committee recommend the following transactions should be binding *per se*.

* promises in writing
* promises for past consideration
* promises to accept part payments of debt to discharge the whole
* promising to do what one is already bound to do
* firm offers, where it is open for a period
* promises detrimentally relied on by the promise, where the promisor should have known reliance would happen

The statute recommended passing legislation "to the effect that either the promise to pay a lesser sum or the payment of a lesser sum should discharge a greater obligation when agreed to by the creditor".
