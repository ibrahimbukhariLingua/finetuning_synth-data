AtlasIntel has established a partnership with Bloomberg News for the development of a study on five Latin American countries ( Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), know as Latam Pulse. The study has a monthly release schedule, and features polling regarding government approval ratings and other key political discussion topics of the month.
