## History

Versapay Corporation was founded in 2006 by Michael Gokturk and Kevin Short. Versapay began accepting clients in 2007 as it set up the company's headquarters in Vancouver, BC.

### Partnership with Chase Paymentech

In January 2007, Versapay partnered with the Canadian affiliate of Chase Paymentech, a United States-based payment processing company. This strategic partnership allowed Versapay to begin processing commonly used electronic payment methods such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, Interac Direct Debit and Interac Online. Versapay began to use the Chase name when marketing Versapay to clients in order to increase the assurance and reliability of Versapay's products.
