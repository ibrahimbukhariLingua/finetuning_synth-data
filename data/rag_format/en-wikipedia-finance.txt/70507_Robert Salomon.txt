## Research and writing

Since the beginning of his career, Salomon's research has been focused on globalization and global strategy. In the early 2000s, his research in this area was focused on global expansion—how firms leverage their knowledge across borders. He also studied exports, and the relationship between exports and firm innovation. In 2007, he wrote his first book entitled *Learning from Exporting: New Insights, New Perspectives.*

In the early 2010s, Salomon's research focus shifted to global risk. He has studied how firms manage the risks that they face in global markets, and how to price the institutional (cultural, political, and economic) risks that firms face in the markets they operate. In 2016, he wrote his second book entitled *Global Vision: How Companies Can Overcome the Pitfalls of Globalization.*


### *Global Vision*

Salomon's book, *Global Vision*, examines the cultural, political and economic risks associated with globalization; and how to deal with those challenges while expanding globally. Skip Prichard called the book "a guide to successfully navigating the global marketplace." While reviewing the book in Choice, S.R. Kahn wrote that the book provides "an excellent and expansive introduction, resource guide, and practical approach to the impact that globalization will have on an institution’s organizational leadership and managerial expertise as well as a unique insight and clarity into the prerequisites, both tangible and intangible, of a successful global expansion."

It was named one of the Best Business Books of 2016 by Strategy+Business Magazine.
