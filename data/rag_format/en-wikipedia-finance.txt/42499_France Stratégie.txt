**France Stratégie** (lit. 'France Strategy') is a government policy analysis body in Paris, initially known as the **Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective** (lit. 'General Commission for Strategy and Foresight') from its creation in April 2013 to its rebranding in June 2014. It is government-funded and part of the Office of the French Prime Minister. It also serves as hub for a network of research bodies and institutes, including CEPII and the Conseil d'Analyse Économique.
