Techno-economic assessment


# Techno-economic assessment



**Techno-economic assessment** or techno-economic analysis (abbreviated TEA) is a method of analyzing the economic performance of an industrial process, product, or service. The methodology originates from earlier work on combining technical, economic and risk assessments for chemical production processes. It typically uses software modeling to estimate capital cost, operating cost, and revenue based on technical and financial input parameters. One desired outcome is to summarize results in a concise and visually coherent form, using visualization tools such as tornado diagrams and sensitivity analysis graphs.

At present, TEA is most commonly used to analyze technologies in the chemical, bioprocess, petroleum, energy, and similar industries. This article focuses on these areas of application.


## Use cases

TEA can be used for studying new technologies or optimizing existing ones. Ideally, a techno-economic model represents the best current understanding of the system being modeled. The following are examples of typical uses.

* **Evaluating economic feasibility:** TEA can be used to anticipate whether a process will be sufficiently profitable under a certain set of assumptions. It can thereby help companies to avoid pursuing dead-ends.
* **Guiding research and development:** When combined with sensitivity analyses like Tornado Diagrams, TEA can be used to identify research and development (R&D) targets with the greatest potential to improve profitability. In this way, it can help companies bring their technologies to market more efficiently.
* **Quantifying uncertainty and risk:** Sensitivity analyses like Tornado Diagrams and Monte Carlo analysis can be used to quantify economic uncertainty in the model results. They can also be used to identify which variables are the source of the most uncertainty.
