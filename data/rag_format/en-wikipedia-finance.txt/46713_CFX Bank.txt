# CFX Bank



**CFX Bank**, whose full name is **CFX Bank Limited**, was a commercial bank in Zimbabwe. It was one of the licensed commercial banks in the country.


## History

The bank was founded in 2006, as a 100% subsidiary of **CFX Financial Services Limited**, its holding company, whose shares trade on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. The bank has two (2) affiliated companies: (a) **CFX Asset Management** and (b) **CFX Merchant Bank**, both of which are also 100% owned by the holding company. In 2009, as a result of changes in Zimbabwean banking laws, **Interfin Holdings Limited**, acquired a controlling interest in CFX Financial Services. Subsequently, the holding company was renamed **Interfin Financial Services Limited**, to reflect the new ownership. The trading symbol for the new bank holding company is: **INTERFIN**. The Government of Zimbabwe has given formal approval of the takeover of CFX Bank by Interfin. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has also signaled its approval of the merger of the two institutions.
