## Aims and Scope

The Journal of Business Ethics aims to improve the human condition by providing a public forum for discussion and debate about ethical issues related to business. The journal's emphasis is on the "ethics" of business ethics, with the goal of promoting dialogue between diverse publics, both academic and civil society.

The editors encourage a broad scope, and the JBE publishes original articles from a wide variety of methodological and disciplinary perspectives concerning ethical issues related to business that bring something new or unique to the discourse in their field. The term 'business' is understood in a wide sense to include all systems involved in the exchange of goods and services, while 'ethics' concerns human action aimed at promoting a good life. Systems of production, consumption, marketing, advertising, social and economic accounting, labour relations, public relations and organisational behaviour are analysed from a moral viewpoint. Speculative philosophy as well as reports of empirical research are welcomed. The style and level of dialogue involve all who are interested in business ethics – civil society, business actors, universities, government agencies and consumer groups.
