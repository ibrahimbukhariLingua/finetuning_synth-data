The Bay Hub


# The Bay Hub



**The Bay Hub** (Chinese: 太豐匯) is an office building in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong.


## History

The building was built on a parcel that had been acquired by Goldin Group for HK$3.43 billion.

In April 2019, Mirae Asset Daewoo invested US$243 million in mezzanine debt for **Goldin Financial Global Centre** (Chinese: 高銀金融環球中心).

The private equity fund PAG and Mapletree Investments jointly acquired the building from the liquidator in January 2023 with a 50/50 holding ratio for a total consideration of HK$5.6 billion. The project was renamed The Bay Hub in early 2024, where the character 太 and 豐 come from the Chinese name of the two companies (太盟投資集團 and 豐樹產業).
