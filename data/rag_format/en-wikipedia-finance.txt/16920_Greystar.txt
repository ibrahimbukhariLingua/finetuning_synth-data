Greystar acquired the property management arm of Alliance Residential Co. in June 2020, and in October 2020, Greystar acquired 45% of Thackeray Partners. That December, Greystar partnered with Walker & Dunlop and Project Destined to create a paid internship program for students from diverse backgrounds in Durham, North Carolina.

Greystar also announced a partnership with CPP Investment Board to pursue life sciences development with a $74 million office and lab in Somerville, Massachusetts, as well as a joint venture to develop and acquire single-family and multifamily rental communities. In November, the company announced an additional $600 million investment in more student housing development, with partnerships with the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Texas at Austin. In December 2021, Greystar acquired Fizzy Living and began expanding its presence in the industrial sector.

Greystar secured roughly $883 million of investments in June 2021 to expand in cities across Europe.

## Tenant lawsuits

In 2019, the company was sued for violating consumer protection laws. In a Los Angeles County Superior Court filing, Greystar was charged with gathering extensive personal identifying information about its tenants without their knowledge or consent. At five Greystar-owned apartment buildings, the company collected information about its tenants' "character" and "general reputation." In 2021, the firm's business model was alleged to be adding to Ireland's housing crisis.

In June 2019, a crane collapsed on apartments owned by Greystar in Old East Dallas, causing serious injury to numerous tenants and the death of one woman. Greystar were subsequently found to have been negligent and were required to pay $860m damages to the 17 plaintiffs, including the parents of the deceased. The court in Dallas found that Greystar had violated safety regulations in several ways, including the presence of a Greystar sign on top of the crane which was a contributing factor to its collapse.

In 2022, a tenant at a Greystar property in Charlotte, North Carolina filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging that Greystar failed to perform necessary building maintenance. In October 2022, Greystar was a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed against the property management software company RealPage. The suit alleged that RealPage colluded with Greystar, among other property management companies, to fix rent prices at those companies' properties.

In January 2024, a tenant at a Greystar property in Lakewood, Colorado sued Greystar over alleged junk fees the company added to her monthly rent. That same month, Greystar charged a Loveland, Colorado family $4,140 in lease-breaking penalty fees following the death of the lease's primary signer.
