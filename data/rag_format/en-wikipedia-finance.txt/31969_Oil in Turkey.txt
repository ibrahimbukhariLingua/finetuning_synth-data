Oil in Turkey


# Oil in Turkey



Oil supplies over a quarter of Turkey's energy. Because the country produces very little oil, it is almost completely dependent on imports of oil and oil products such as petrol and diesel, over half of which is consumed in the country's road vehicles. Turkey is the world's largest user of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for road transport.

Because Turkey produces only 7% of the oil it consumes, the country's total imports are worth more than its exports, which is a problem for its economy. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began, several European countries stopped buying Russian oil, petrol and diesel but Turkey's relations with Russia are such that it supplies most such imports.


## Demand

During the 2010s, demand for oil considerably increased, mainly due to increased use of diesel, and is forecast to slowly increase until 2040. Over half of Turkey's imported oil and oil products are used for road transport, and Turkey is the world's largest user of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for road transport. It is hoped the locally manufactured electric cars and other road vehicles from the country's automotive industry will eventually reduce the import bill. In 2021, Turkey's consumption of diesel—both domestic and export—was over six times that of petrol.¹⁹


## Health and environmental impact

Fossil-fuelled road-vehicle exhaust emissions pollute large cities with nitrogen dioxide and other gasses. Air pollution from diesel is worse than that from petrol.

As of 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ the Black Sea is not an emission control area; air pollution is emitted from ships in Turkish Black Sea ports. Maritime incidents in the Turkish Straits have resulted in oil spills. Air pollution from ships burning heavy fuel oil near cities is a problem in some places, such as Mersin.

Oil production in Russia causes methane leaks into the atmosphere. Because the international greenhouse gas inventory standard is production-based, this is accounted for in Russia's greenhouse gas emissions rather than those of Turkey.

Oil and gas production in southeast Turkey is estimated by Climate Trace to have emitted over a million tonnes of greenhouse gas in 2023.
