Commerce (river)


# Commerce (river)



The river **Bolbec** (French pronunciation: [bɔlbɛk]) or **Commerce** (French pronunciation: [kɔmɛʁs] ) is one of the rivers that flow from the plateau of the southern Pays de Caux in the Seine-Maritime *département* of Normandy into the Seine. It is 15.5 km (9.6 mi) long.

The river rises at Bolbec and passes Gruchet-le-Valasse, where its name changes to the Commerce. It then passes through Lillebonne and joins the Seine at Notre-Dame-de-Gravenchon.


## Economy

The river hosted many watermills that powered machinery to process both cotton and flax. The area became so prosperous it was named the Golden Valley.
