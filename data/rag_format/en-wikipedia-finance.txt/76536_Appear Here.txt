Appear Here


# Appear Here



**Appear Here** is an online marketplace for retail space. Since the company was founded in 2014, it has facilitated the opening of over 10,000 stores in the UK, US, and France.


## History

In the summer of 2012, Ross Bailey and a friend decided to create a brand called Rock and Rule to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. They opened a pop up shop on Marshall Street, Soho to launch it. What surprised Bailey was the number of people asking him how he got hold of the shop. It was at this point he realised there was an opportunity to make it easier for people to find and rent short-term retail space. When Rock and Rule closed, Bailey took his share of the profit and put it into launching Appear Here.

Currently, Appear Here lists over 10,000 short-term spaces worldwide, with prime retail properties in global cities including, London, Manchester, New York City and Paris. Over 200,000 brands have signed up to the platform, including Apple, Supreme, Nike, Netflix, Chanel and Tommy Hilfiger.


### Expansion

In November 2013, Appear Here closed a £1 million funding round, securing backing from Howzat Partners (backers of Trivago), MMC Ventures (backers of AlexandAlexa) and Forward Investment Partners (existing investors and backers of uSwitch and Hailo). Other participants in this round include Meyer Bergman, Playfair Capital and Ballpark Ventures, as well as Marc Hazan (of Spotify) and Miroma Ventures (investors in Pinterest).

In November 2014, Appear Here raised a further £5 million from Balderton Capital to fund its international expansion. In 2016, Appear Here launched in its first international city, Paris. In April 2017, Appear Here expanded to the US, launching in New York.

In May 2017, Appear Here raised $12 million in Series B funding. Leading the round was Octopus Ventures, with participation from Simon Venture Group, and existing investors Balderton Capital, MMC, Meyer Bergman and Playfair Capital.
