## History

A. C. Abdur Rahim was born on 20 January 1915. After being orphaned at age seven, he was raised by an uncle, who employed him in his departmental store. Rahim partnered in a small tailoring and textile business in Calcutta, then in the early 1940s began trading independently on a modest scale. He married in 1945, and two years later, after the partition of India, moved his family to Chittagong, East Bengal. In 1950, he formed a small trading company with a capital of 200,000 Pakistani rupees ($42,000 as of 1950).

On 15 April 1954, he incorporated the business as Rahimafrooz & Co, named after his eldest son, Afrooz Rahim. Initially, it focused on garment retailing.
