## Controversy


### Indian Oil Corporation's activities in Russia

Indian Oil Corporation has faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia despite widespread international sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The corporation has been listed on platforms such as *Leave Russia,* which monitors companies still active in the country, raising ethical concerns about its stance in the global effort to economically isolate Russia. Critics argue that such actions undermine international solidarity against the invasion of Ukraine. The company's activities have sparked questions about its commitment to corporate social responsibility and its alignment with international norms during geopolitical crises.
