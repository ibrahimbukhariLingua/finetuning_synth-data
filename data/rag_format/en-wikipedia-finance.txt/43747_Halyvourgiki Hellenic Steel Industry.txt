### Downfall

In 2012, the company experienced a dramatic downfall in production, with sales falling 70.62%. In 2012, the firm owed financial institutions over €1 billion. In February 2014, following a drastic drop in the demand for steel in Greece, and high energy costs, the company halted steel production, and suspended 200 of its remaining 263 workers. Prior to that, 148 workers voluntarily retired.

In 2015, the company permanently ceased production, but continued to operate for the sake of its employees. In a 2018 interview with the head of the worker's union president, he stated that he had not seen the company's owner, Konstantinos Angelopoulos, in two years. By 2018, the union stated that the firm employed 170 workers, who worked three days a week, down from an estimated 600 to 700 workers in 2006. As of 2018, Halyvourgiki was more than €400 million in debt to private banks and the Greek public sector, and was unable to service its debt since 2016.
