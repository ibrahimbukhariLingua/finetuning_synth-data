## History

The journal was founded in 1933 by a group of economists based in Britain and the United States. The original editorial team consisted of Abba P. Lerner, Paul Sweezy, and Ursula Kathleen Hicks. It is published by Oxford University Press. From the beginning, the board of editors has operated independently of any university department or learned society. The founding document of the journal stated that "The object of the Review is to supplement the facilities for the publication of new work on theoretical and applied economics, particularly by young writers." and that "Any member" of the editorial board "who becomes a Reader or Professor in a British University must resign his membership."

In its early years, the journal was used to log the macroeconomic debates of younger followers of Friedrich Hayek (such as Abba Lerner) and John Maynard Keynes (such as the members of the Cambridge Circus).
