European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association


# European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association



**European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association** (EPHMRA) is a European pharmaceutical market research association established in 1961. EPHMRA aimed to provide the best methods of market research and share it with the global community. It also aimed to improve the public’s general healthcare, by doing market research which then ensures the quality and safety of marketed pharmaceutical products. To ensure the research done is according to the ethical standard, EPHMRA developed the Code of Conduct and formulated the Ethics Committee.

Internally, EPHMRA provided activities including training, and conferences to members regularly, aiming to enhance the professional development of the members and bring insights into the pharmaceutical market research field. Externally, EPHMRA collaborates with other organizations, for example, the European Network of Research Ethics, and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) aiming to improve the pharmaceutical market research methods, which could further enhance the overall safety of consumers.


## History

Due to the need for comparable and reliable information related to pharmaceutical product research and marketing in the 1960s, various European companies sent their representatives to meet in Geneva on 5 May 1961. This meeting cause the foundation of the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EPHMRA), carrying the aim to search for the best possible market research method and share it with the community.

Across the decades, EPHMRA has grown into a leading authority on pharmaceutical market research, developing best practices and guidelines for the industry and providing a range of services to its members. Pharmaceutical companies, market research agencies, and other organizations involved in the pharmaceutical industry are all included in the membership of EPHMRA.

Today, the organization continues to have a significant impact on the future of pharmaceutical market research in Europe, providing a platform for industry professionals to discuss, network, and collaborate.

### Market researches

EPHMRA do market researches regularly, aiming to investigate on the latest development in the pharmaceutical market research to the public, and to advocate pharmaceutical market research policies to the government. Recently, research topics related to digital health, patient engagement and GDPR compliance have been investigated. Moreover, EPHMRA would formulates a Global Market Research Report every year, which give insights on the market research methods used in different countries.


### Training

Training programs were designed with an aim to providing members with up-to-date skills and resources needed in pharmaceutical market research. Both online and face-to-face training are offered, covering topics including data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethics.

#### Classification Committee

The Classification Committee is responsible to develop and update the Anatomical Classification System and the Therapeutic Classification System. The classification system is used to provide a standardized framework in categorizing pharmaceutical products based on their anatomical and therapeutical categories, which then enables researchers compare the data among different pharmaceutical products effectively during market researches.

#### Data and Science Committee

The Data and Science Committee is responsible to advocate the use of innovative data analysis. To achieve this, the Committee has to be aware of emerging trends and technologies in data analysis and see if the new technologies could be applied in pharmaceutical market research. Moreover, the committee is responsible to provide data analysis trainings to members.


#### Ethics Committee

The Ethics Committee aims to promote ethical standards in pharmaceutical market research. The Committee is responsible to update the Code of Conduct, which is guides the ethical consideration in market research. The committee also works with the European Network of Research Ethics, which is a network of European ethical organisation, to discuss new ways to promote research ethics.


## Controversies

There are complaints that The European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EPHMRA)’s Anatomical Classification System is not accurate enough, since it over-simplifies certain therapeutic conditions. Moreover, there are concerns about privacy during data collection and analysis in the market research carried out by the organization. It is therefore argued that there may be a need to supervise the EPHMRA to ensure its research are transparent and follows ethical standard and to prevent potential conflict of interest from occur.
