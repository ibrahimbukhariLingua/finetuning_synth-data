## Products


### Super-rapid charging

JFE Engineering Corporation is developing a quick charging station that it claims can take a battery from zero charge to 50% full in about 3 minutes. It has two batteries, one that stores electrical energy from the grid and another that delivers it to the car at extremely high current (500-600 ampere), which allows it to use a low voltage power supply. The company claims that even though one station costs about $63,000, that's roughly 40% less than the competing CHAdeMO system.


### Bicycle Tree

The bicycle tree is an automatic storage system for bicycles that can hold up to 6,000 bikes. The systems works by fitting the bicycle with an electronic tag and a computer saves the owner's data. Then a mechanical arm pulls the bike into a cylindrical well and stores it in a free location. When the owner wants to retrieve the bike, a card is swiped through a reader and the computer retrieves the bike based on the data.
