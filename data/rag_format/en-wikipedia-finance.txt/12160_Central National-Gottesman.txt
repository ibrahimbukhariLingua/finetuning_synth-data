## History

Founded in Manhattan, New York City, in 1886 as M. Gottesman & Company, the firm was substantially expanded under his son D.S. Gottesman in the first half of the 20th century. When D.S. Gottesman first started, he was a founding partner of The Central National Bank in New York City, which, through a series of mergers, the bank became part of JPMorgan Chase & Co. After the sale of the bank, the paper company has continued to grow both organically and through acquisition. In 1984 CNG entered the paper distribution business in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of United States through the acquisition of Lindenmeyr Paper Corporation, followed by D.F. Munroe Company in 1988, Communication Paper Corporation in 1991, and Perkins & Squier Company in 1998.
