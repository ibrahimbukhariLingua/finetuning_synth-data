The Graph


# The Graph



**The Graph** is an indexing protocol for organizing and accessing data from blockchains and storage networks. It allows developers to search, find, publish, and use the public data they need to build decentralized applications. The Graph Network enables the accessibility of decentralized applications through public and open APIs, called subgraphs. The native currency of The Graph is $GRT. The Graph volunteers, known as Curators, Indexers, and Delegators work to process data and share it with Consumers. The Graph offers support to index data from 25 different blockchain protocols including Ethereum, NEAR, Arbitrium, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Celo, Fantom, and Moonbeam.
