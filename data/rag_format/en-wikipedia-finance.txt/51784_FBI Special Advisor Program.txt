FBI Special Advisor Program


# FBI Special Advisor Program



The **FBI Special Advisor Program** is an internal consulting and leadership development rotational program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The group consists of recent graduates from the top Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. FBI special advisors are primarily responsible for serving in an advisory capacity to the FBI Senior Executive team and completing "management" type of issues.


## History

The FBI Special Advisor Program evolved from a 2002 effort by the FBI's Finance Division to recruit new talent from top business schools. Initially, one graduate of Harvard Business School was hired to work in the Director's Office. In 2003, another Harvard Business School graduate joined the FBI to work for the chief financial officer. The work of these two merited the attention of the FBI's senior leadership and led to a proposal for a formal business school recruiting program. In 2007, executives from 25 FBI divisions participated in the three-year-old Special Advisor Program.
