## Reputation

David Marchant is known for publishing articles on OffshoreAlert that have been criticized for inaccuracies and distortions. Accusations against him include fabricating stories and quotes, and creating misleading narratives.


## Legal issues

In 2004, ''OffshoreAlert'' published a report alleging that Prime Minister Keith Mitchell had accepted $500,000 for appointing a U.S. national to a diplomatic position. Mitchell denied the report, saying he had done nothing improper. Later, the opposition National Democratic Congress held a press conference denouncing the alleged corruption of the government, as reported in ''OffshoreAlert''. The Grenadian's Government Information Service then issued a warning that media outlets that broadcast or published the content of the press conference could face legal action. Within a few days, the government had filed a criminal libel lawsuit in Grenada brought by the prime minister against ''OffshoreAlert'' and its publisher, Marchant, a British national.

In 2011, Roland Frank Bleyer filed a defamation complaint against him and his company. This lawsuit was similarly dismissed due to a failure to prosecute (FWOP).

In 2016, Fedor Sannikov filed a defamation lawsuit against him and his company, which was subsequently dismissed at a FWOP (failure to prosecute) hearing.

Marchant boasts that " We’ve never lost a libel action, never published a correction or apology to any plaintiffs and never paid — or been required to pay — them one cent in costs or damages".
