List of sovereign states by freshwater withdrawal


# List of sovereign states by freshwater withdrawal



This is the **list of countries by freshwater withdrawal** for the year 2020, based on the latest data available in January 2024, by World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization (AQUASTAT data). The list includes sovereign states and self-governing dependent territories based upon the ISO standard ISO 3166-1.

According to World Bank, ″annual freshwater withdrawals refer to total water withdrawals, not counting evaporation losses from storage basins. Withdrawals also include water from desalination plants in countries where they are a significant source. Withdrawals can exceed 100 percent of total renewable resources where extraction from nonrenewable aquifers or desalination plants is considerable or where there is significant water reuse. Withdrawals for agriculture and industry are total withdrawals for irrigation and livestock production and for direct industrial use (including withdrawals for cooling thermoelectric plants). Withdrawals for domestic uses include drinking water, municipal use or supply, and use for public services, commercial establishments, and homes.″

The level of water stress (freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources) is the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental water requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also known as *water withdrawal intensity*.

According to Food and Agriculture Organization, ″total freshwater withdrawal is the sum of surface water withdrawal and groundwater withdrawal″.

> *[Total freshwater withdrawal (surface water + groundwater)] = [Total water withdrawal] - [Desalinated water produced] - [Treated wastewater reused] - [Reused agricultural drainage water]*
