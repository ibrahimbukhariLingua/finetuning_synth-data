EurObserv'ER


# EurObserv'ER



**EurObserv'ER** is a consortium dedicated to the monitoring of the development of the various sectors of renewable energies in the European Union.

Created in 1999 by Observ'ER, the Observatory of renewable energies in France, it is composed of five other partners: ECN (The Energy research Centre of the Netherlands), IEO (EC BREC Institute of Renewable Energetic Ltd), RENAC (Renewables Academy AG), FS (Frankfurt School of finance and management) and IJS (Institut Jozef Stefan).

Each year it publishes a number of reports, one for each sector: photovoltaic, wind energy, solid biomass, hydro, solar thermal, concentrated solar power, ocean energies, geothermal energy, biofuels, biogas and solid waste. These reports are called "Barometers", e.g. "Biofuels barometer 2013". These barometers summarises the state for each of the EU member states for the particular energy sector using both technical and socioeconomic indicators. It also publishes an annual report on the state of renewable energies in Europe.

EurObserv'ER provides free information to a large public and many other actors as the policy makers, industry players and journalists.
It is supported by the Intelligent Energy- Europe Programme, Ademe and Caisse des Dépôts.


## Objectives

**EurObserv'ER's objective** is to provide a synthetic and a very reactive picture of the energy, industry and policy trends observed in the EU 28 Member States for each RES sector. Thus, it gives a reactive measurement tool that makes up for the gap between the end of the year and the time when official statistics are released.

By monitoring the EU Member States progression towards the 2020 RES directive targets, EurObserv'ER works as a support to the fulfilment of the EU policy to develop the RES share of gross final energy consumption
The current project will extend the scope of indicators and analysis to the integration of Croatia and the provision of a complete set of investment indicators. In fact, because of the economic crisis, public spending on RES development are being decreased in many Member States, so the EurObserv'ER team wants to help attracting private investments in the RES sectors.
