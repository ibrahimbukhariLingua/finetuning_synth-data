Profit (TV series)


# Profit (TV series)



***Profit*** is an American drama television series that originally aired in 1996 on the Fox Broadcasting Company (Mondays at 9:00 p.m. EST). The series was created by David Greenwalt and John McNamara, who each directed several episodes. It starred Adrian Pasdar as the eponymous lead character Jim Profit. In February 2008, repeat episodes began airing on Chiller (in the USA), and in October 2010 on CBS Action (in Europe).

Considered by many to have been well ahead of its time, the series was a precursor to the trend of "edgy" TV melodramas (featuring dark themes and multidimensional characters) such as *The Sopranos*, *Mad Men*, and *Breaking Bad*. Controversial themes largely stemming from the lead character's amoral, *Richard III*-esque ways, along with low ratings, made the show uncomfortable and unfamiliar viewing for mainstream U.S. audiences and Fox network affiliates at the time, leading to its cancellation after just four episodes (including the pilot) aired. In 2013 *TV Guide* ranked the series #4 on its list of 60 shows that were "Canceled Too Soon", calling the series "shockingly memorable".


## Summary

Jim Profit is a newly promoted junior-executive at Gracen & Gracen (G&G), a multinational conglomerate that often engages in unethical business practices while actively cultivating a positive public image. G&G's dark side does not bother Profit, who is not above using blackmail, bribery, extortion, or worse to get ahead himself. Jim Profit addresses the audience via voiceover narration, and occasionally even "breaks the fourth wall" by speaking directly to the camera/audience with such quotes as: "The line most people say they won't cross ... it's usually something they've already done when they thought no one was watching." Through frequent inner monologues, Profit shares his motives, plans, and situational observations with the audience. When home alone at night, Profit continues his ‘work’ in his office (hidden behind a false wall of his living room), searching the Internet and hacking G&G's servers for information to be used as research and ammunition for his various schemes. Whenever he eliminates or outmaneuvers a G&G target, that person's avatar is exploded and erased from his computer's virtual-G&G-offices environment. While obviously affluent and living in a well-furnished luxury penthouse, Profit still goes to bed the same way he did as a child: curled up, naked in the corner of a large G&G shipping box like the one he was raised in.


## Characters


### Main

* Jim Profit (Adrian Pasdar) – born James "Jimmy" Stakowski, he was raised in a cardboard G&G shipping box (with a hole cut out for him to view a constantly-on television) by a neglectful, physically and psychologically abusive father in a rural area near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Profit reinvents himself as an Ivy League-educated, corporate business prodigy after escaping his past by chaining his father to his bed, setting it afire, then fleeing the family ranch as a teenager. His upbringing leaves Profit with a hatred of TV, and idolizing Gracen & Gracen as the ideal family he never had. As a result, Profit's goal as an adult is to rise high enough in G&G to indispensably embed himself into the Gracens’ business and personal lives – by any means necessary. He worked in auditing before ascending to junior vice president of Acquisitions; his stated goal is to become president of Acquisitions. He climbs the corporate ladder by covertly engineering the ruin of those who stand in his way and/or refuse to assist him, while mostly staying behind-the-scenes himself.
* Joanne Meltzer (Lisa Zane) – Profit's archenemy and G&G's obsessive, crusading West Coast chief of security. She had a short-lived affair with Jack Walters while his wife had temporarily run off with a lover. She remains loyal to and friendly with Jack, admiring his decent and ethical nature – even after he reconciles with his wife (who openly resents her). Jack's spectacular downfall (engineered by Profit) along with parallels in the natures of Profit and her older sister (who raised but also brutally abused her) are key forces driving her to expose and stop Profit. A former police detective and "fanatical in pursuit of a goal", the ever-suspicious Meltzer constantly tries to figure out and foil Profit's plans, but is oftentimes a step behind her nemesis. She admires Jeffrey Sykes for his sterling morals, and perceives him as able to outsmart and defeat Profit.
* Charles Henry "Chaz" Gracen (Keith Szarabajka) – G&G's no-nonsense, paranoid, violently short-tempered chief executive officer. Although he takes a different mistress each year, making money is his only love. To clients and all outsiders to G&G he convincingly pretends to be soft-spoken, friendly and patient. Though usually agitated and curt, Chaz occasionally displays a dark, passive-aggressive sense of humor, constantly berates his brother, and bitterly chafes at working in the long shadow of his meddling father/boss, G&G's founder and chairman emeritus of the G&G board of directors.
* Pete Gracen (Jack Gwaltney) – Chaz's younger brother, and the senior vice president of Acquisitions. A longtime alcoholic, Pete secretly wants Chaz's approval – and to be president of Acquisitions, or even CEO – despite being impotent, immature, and apparently incompetent. Drunken stupors, often in public with family, are frequent sources of embarrassment and humiliation for Pete.
* Nora Gracen (Allison Hossack) – Pete's insecure, emotionally fragile, lonely trophy wife. Trusting and desperate for the love and sense of purpose that her failing husband can no longer provide, she becomes hopelessly obsessed with Profit, after he seduces her but then (intentionally) ends their affair just before physically consummating it. Nora regards Profit as a close friend, confidant, and kindred spirit; Profit strings her along by continuing to build intimacy between them, then restating that he wants to be "just friends" whenever she tries to act on her attraction to him. She harbors unhealed emotional wounds from a childhood tragedy.
* Gail Koner (Lisa Darr) – Profit's resourceful, morally conflicted secretary (originally Jack Walters' secretary), and primary henchperson. Initially, Profit blackmails Gail into assisting him in his schemes; however, she feels increasingly loyal (and/or obligated) to Profit, as he rewards her service with extravagant favors (e.g., saving her job, hiding her embezzlement, and arranging for vastly upgraded – and fully paid – nursing home care for her seriously ill mother). She may be the only character that Profit has any genuine human connection with. Profit takes pride as he guides Gail in developing her skills in duplicity. Profit seems interested in her mother's well-being, and after Gail is passed over for promotion (yet again), he promises to mold her into "executive material."
* Bobbi Stakowski (Lisa Blount) – Profit's hedonistic, temperamental step-mother (his father's 2nd wife), and occasional lover (who seduced and molested him during his socially isolated, early adolescence). A shrewd-yet-unpredictable drug abuser, con woman and former prostitute, Bobbi repeatedly tries to blackmail Profit (with threats of exposing evidence of his true background and past crimes – including murder) into financing a luxurious, effort-free lifestyle for her.
* Jeffrey Sykes (Sherman Augustus) – a litigious corporate law attorney and G&G's newly hired vice president of Business Affairs. A highly driven, P.R.-savvy do-gooder, Sykes takes a more directly antagonistic approach to Profit and is warmly welcomed by Joanne Meltzer as an ally. Sykes is single-mindedly committed to a secret, personal agenda that repeatedly – but sometimes unwittingly – disrupts Profit's schemes.

### Recurring and guests

* Jack Walters (Scott Paulin) – G&G's former President of Acquisitions.
* Elizabeth Gracen-Walters (Jennifer Hetrick) – Jack's (recovering) alcoholic wife; cousin of "Chaz" and Pete.
* Constance Gracen (Teryl Rothery) – Chaz's estranged wife.
* Dr. Jeremy Batewell (John Hawkes) – a former G&G employee who sexually harassed Gail Koner.
* "Kelly Hunt"/Carol McKenna (Jessica Tuck) – Profit's female equivalent.

## Critical reception

The critical response to *Profit* at the time of its debut was overwhelmingly positive. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 94% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 9.0/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Unapologetically amoral and headlined by an unnerving Adrian Pasdar, *Profit* pays off handsomely as outrageous entertainment."

Howard Rosenberg of the *Los Angeles Times* called *Profit* "... rip-roaring, sinus-clearing, bold and wonderful." Tom Gliatto of *People* magazine said of *Profit*: "Refreshingly cruel, Fox's *Profit* is the most exciting new show I've seen this year." John J. O'Conner from *The New York Times* called *Profit* "one of the most intriguing shows to come along since *Twin Peaks* ..." Joyce Millman of salon.com stated: "*Profit* gains heft ... from its nervy satiric vision of corporate capitalist culture."
Eric Mink from *The New York Daily News* stated "Jim Profit may well be the most unremittingly evil character ever to serve as the protagonist and principal voice of a network TV series. Next to Profit, *Dallas'* J.R. Ewing is as menacing as Babe the Pig." *Entertainment Weekly* included *Profit* in its "Ten Best TV Shows for 1996" list at position #8.


## Controversy and cancellation

Despite numerous positive critical reviews and intense industry buzz, *Profit* was canceled after only 5 out of the 9 hours produced were actually broadcast by Fox. Low Nielsen ratings were cited as the official cause; *Profit* ranked 138th of 160 shows for 1996 and suffered from viewer tune-out during the airing of the 2-hour pilot episode. Other factors that may have hastened *Profit*’s demise include:

* Viewers reportedly flooded their local Fox network affiliates with phone calls objecting to Jim Profit’s immoral actions, some even referring to him as "Satan in a Suit"; such opinions were most vociferously expressed by viewers in the Bible Belt region of the southern USA. Some Fox network affiliates even threatened to pre-empt *Profit* in their local markets, replacing it with alternative programming.
* Members of the business community were outraged that *Profit* portrayed them so poorly. Shaifali Puri of *Fortune* said: "Just in case there's anyone left who isn't convinced corporate America is a den of naked ambition and bald turpitude, comes now (the TV show) *Profit*." It was rumored that even Fox network founder Rupert Murdoch objected to the show's edgy portrayal of corporate America, although Adrian Pasdar was quoted as saying that *Profit* was Murdoch's favorite TV show.
* Airings of *Profit* consistently lost almost all of the lead-in audience from the smash-hit melodrama *Melrose Place* (the original version) which was scheduled in the timeslot immediately preceding *Profit*. This reportedly did not sit well with *Melrose Place'*s executive producer Aaron Spelling, especially after *Time* and *Entertainment Weekly* published glowing reviews of *Profit* but scathing reviews of *Melrose Place*. Coincidentally, Spelling even approached Adrian Pasdar in 1992 to play the role of Jake Hanson on *Melrose Place*; however Pasdar rejected the role despite Spelling's status as one of the most powerful and influential U.S. television producers of the 1970s-1990s.

*Profit* co-creator David Greenwalt hypothesized that "What might have turned off viewers to *Profit* wasn't just that it was so different [from other TV shows of the time] but that it was such an affront to it." The cancellation of *Profit* was lamented by the organization Viewers for Quality Television; VQT founder Dorothy Swanson stated: "It certainly was not a mainstream show. It wasn't for everyone. There were parts of it I'm sure mainstream viewers found very disturbing and unappealing. But for people who like interesting television, it was very well written. It was spellbinding. You had to know what made this guy (Jim Profit) tick."


## Awards

* Adrian Pasdar was nominated for a 1996 Petcabus Award in the category "Best Actor in a Drama Series" for his role as Jim Profit.
* *Profit* was nominated for a 1996 Artios Award in category "Best Casting for TV, Dramatic Pilot".

Seven minutes of Fox promotional spots for *Profit* were provided as well, including a unique 30-second trailer showing Jim Profit crushing a spider on a park bench, dismissively calling it an "amateur" (predator).

Ostalgica released the complete series on DVD in Region 2 on April 24, 2012, under the title *Jim Profit – Ein Mann geht über Leichen* (A Man Walks over Dead Bodies). The three-disc set contains the two-hour pilot and seven episodes, along with the option of the original English or German-dubbed voice audio for all episodes.

The content of the episodes is identical on all releases of the DVD with the exception of the opening voiceover by Jim Profit in the pilot episode:

* Region 1 Voiceover: *Wayne Gresham is dead. A former VP at Gracen and Gracen incorporated, he was overworked, overweight, and well now, just plain "over". This is Wayne's boss, Jack Walters. He's the president of acquisitions, a smart decent man. As well respected as anyone at G&G. Gail Koner, Jack's secretary. Is that grief in her eyes or is she hiding something? Let's find out.*
* Region 2 Voiceover: *Wayne Gresham is dead. He was 47 years old. A junior vice president of acquisitions at Gracen and Gracen incorporated where I happen to work. This is Wayne's boss, Jack Walters. He's the president of acquisitions, a smart decent man. As well respected as anyone at Gracen and Gracen. Gail Koner, Jack's executive secretary, a loyal employee of 3 years and very devoted to her boss.*

## Production

*Profit* was produced by Greenwalt/McNamara Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with New World Television, and was the final series to come from Cannell's company (as well as one of the few for which he did not write any scripts).

The exterior shots outside the Gracen & Gracen twin towers were filmed on the plaza in front of the Sheraton Wall Centre Hotel in Vancouver. For production, a "Gracen & Gracen Wall Center" placard was positioned over the covered entrance in front of one building and two G&G logo monuments were placed in the front and center of the plaza. Another part of the same hotel complex now includes the well-known One Wall Centre building that had not yet been constructed when *Profit* was shot in early 1996.

According to the Region 1 DVD liner notes, the interior G&G office shots for the two-hour pilot episode were taken at the real working offices of B.C. Gas and that of a prestigious law firm in downtown Vancouver. Subsequent episodes were shot in studio sets modeled after these offices. The scene outside a hospital with Joanne Meltzer and Profit in the episode "Healing" was shot in front of St. Paul's Hospital located just across Burrard Street from the Sheraton Wall Centre. The exterior of Profit's apartment building featuring columnar bay windows up and down the entire front of the building is a location called *Eugenia Place* in Vancouver's West End; the structure is notable for the presence of a 35-foot Pin oak tree growing on the building's roof, located approximately 180 feet above street level.

Profit's exploration of Gracen & Gracen's computer network was done through a 3D-image rendering interface, which represents G&G's corporate data as a building with a series of offices. This was implemented using the Virtual Reality Modeling Language which was believed to be the way that future websites would be built in 1996. In the years leading up to the production of *Profit* numerous films such as *The Lawnmower Man*, *Virtuosity*, and especially the corporate thriller *Disclosure*, featured a virtual reality interface which directly inspired its use in *Profit*.


## Unused story lines

David Greenwalt and John McNamara gave details of plotlines from the never-produced second season in the audio commentaries on the Region 1 DVD.

* Joanne Meltzer dies early in the first episode of the second season while in Ireland looking into Profit's background. The phone booth from which she is calling Sykes is set to explode. There is a bomb planted there by the Irish Republican Army. It was to be revealed later that this was done at the behest of Profit.
* Jim has stolen the identity of a "real" Jim Profit. The "real" Jim Profit is in a coma after he was drowned by the protagonist Jim Profit. Later on, the protagonist would return to finish killing his alias.
* Charles "Chaz" Gracen has a heart attack while running on his treadmill due to a mild poison Profit slips into Chaz's water bottle. Profit eventually convinces Chaz that his father (who is the Chairman of G&G's board of directors) is trying to kill him.
* Profit engineers the death of Chaz and Pete Gracen's father to help the two brothers reconcile their differences, eliminate a troublemaker on G&G's Board of Directors, and help tighten Profit's control over G&G.
* Another storyline involved Profit getting a current Senator drunk to the point of blackout, staging a car accident, and convincing the Senator that he had killed someone. These events probably led into a related story line in which Pete Gracen becomes a Senator himself.
* Pete and Nora Gracen would have divorced.

In 2001 it was reported that co-creator David Greenwalt, who later went on to produce the *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* spin-off series *Angel*, once entertained the idea of having Adrian Pasdar reprise his role as Jim Profit on *Angel*. The main villains in *Angel* were a law firm called Wolfram & Hart, and Profit would have joined the firm. Conflicting working schedules with Pasdar (then the lead on NBC's *Mysterious Ways*), and the predictable difficulties in securing the rights to use the Jim Profit character prevented this from happening before *Angel'*s run ended in its fifth and final season in 2004.
