Economy of Dublin


# Economy of Dublin



Dublin is the largest city and capital of Ireland, and is the country's economic hub. As well as being the location of the national parliament and most of the civil service, Dublin is also the focal point of media in the country. Much of Ireland's transportation network radiates from the city, and Dublin Port is responsible for a large proportion of Ireland's import and export trade.

Dublin is home to a number of multinational corporations, including in "hi tech" sectors such as information technology, digital media, financial services and the pharmaceutical industry. Dublin is also the location of the headquarters of several large Irish public companies including Bank of Ireland, DCC plc, AIB Group, Ardagh Group, CRH plc, Ryanair, Smurfit Kappa and Flutter Entertainment (formerly Paddy Power Betfair). Many of Ireland's public sector and state owned employers are based in Dublin including utility companies such as ESB Group, educational institutions such as Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, Dublin City University and Technological University Dublin and most of Ireland's higher courts, RTÉ (Irelands national public service broadcaster), and several teaching hospitals. Other employers service the tourism and retail markets.

### Other indicators

Dublin was at the centre of Ireland's rapid economic growth from 1995 to 2007 when both the standards and the cost of living in the city rose dramatically. By 2018, the Economic and Social Research Institute reported that the concentration of population and economic activity in Dublin (accounting for approximately 50% of all economic activity in the country) was "unsustainable". The Irish Times also queried whether the lack of available rental accommodation in the capital would impact Dublin's economic growth.


## Government

Dublin is the capital of Ireland, and many of the jobs in the Irish Civil Service are based in the central Dublin 1 and Dublin 2 postal districts.

In 1994, County Dublin, which excluded the city, was divided into three local government areas: Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, South Dublin and Fingal.
