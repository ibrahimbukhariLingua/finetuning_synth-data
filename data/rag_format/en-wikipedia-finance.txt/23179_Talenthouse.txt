## Controversy

In February 2023, many creatives who had worked for Talenthouse came forward to reveal that they had not been paid for the work they had done. Roman Scharf, the co-founder of Talenthouse and chairman of the board, said: "We are extremely sorry for this unacceptable delay in payments and any inconvenience and upset it has caused. We take this matter extremely seriously and are working on a long-term robust solution that will benefit all Talenthouse creatives. This solution is well advanced and we plan to announce it soon." Whilst some clients have since paid artists directly, as of February 2023 the issue is believed to be ongoing with numerous artists working for other clients still owed money.

As of July 2023 Talenthouse is going through financial restructuring and seeking outside investors. Currently the Talenthouse website is unavailable and other sites hosted and maintained by Talenthouse like Ello.co are also unreachable. No comments have been made by Talenthouse on the status or the future of the company, its websites or the content people had stored on their platforms.
