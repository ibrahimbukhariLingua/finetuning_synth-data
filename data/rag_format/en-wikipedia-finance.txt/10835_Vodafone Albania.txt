Vodafone Albania


# Vodafone Albania



**Vodafone Albania SH.A** is a major telecommunications company based in Tirana, Albania. It is part of the Vodafone Group.


## Technology

Vodafone Albania started offering GSM services on August 3, 2001, after AMC
started doing so in 1996.

In 2011, Vodafone was the first to launch 3G services. 4 years later, Vodafone was again first to launch a 4G/4G+ network in the country.

In 2018, Plus, the 4th largest mobile network provider, ceased operations in Albania. Vodafone agreed to buy 50% of the frequencies that Plus used to operate, alongside Telekom Albania (now One Albania).

On February 12, 2019, Albania’s telecoms watchdog, Electronic and Postal Communications Authority (AKEP) announced the conclusion of the first round of its 800 MHz auction, confirming that Vodafone Albania was the only provider to submit a bid for the frequencies. The carrier offered just over EUR 7.44 million (USD 8.4 million) for a 2×10 MHz block of spectrum in the 800 MHz band. AKEP noted that its bid evaluation committee will now review the legal, economic and technical documentation accompanying Vodafone’s bid.

On October 16, 2019, AKEP gave the authorisation to test 5G networks on the 3600 MHz-3700 MHz frequency band. On October 30, it was publicly tested, alongside important state officials, such as Prime Minister, Edi Rama. The full rollout of 5G to consumers has commenced on November 26, 2024.


## ABCom

On 29 October 2020, Vodafone Albania agreed to acquire the country’s largest cable operator ABCom. “This transaction is part of Vodafone Group’s wider strategy to enhance its mobile businesses with broadband and pay TV services”, Vodafone said in a press release.

The acquisition enabled Vodafone Albania to become a full service telecoms company by offering fixed and mobile communications and TV services to households and businesses. As of the end of June 2020, ABCom had 86.000 broadband subscribers behind One Albania with 133.000 subscribers.


## Market share

Vodafone Albania, as per Q1 2019, has 3.66 million subscribers, out of which there are 2.5 million active users. An active user is defined as having communication in the last three months.

The regulatory authority for telecommunication in Albania is the Electronic and Postal Communications Authority.

## Economic and social investments

The company invested more than €1,415 million in Albania including investments in infrastructure, spectrum, regulatory fees, distribution channels, human resources etc. Only in 2016-17, Vodafone Albania invested €32 million in network infrastructure and about €16 million in spectrum acquisitions.


## Controversy

In 2017, operators changed the duration of their monthly packages to 28 days instead of 30. The matter was investigated by the Authority and the operators were ordered to resume the 30-day duration once again.

In 2019, the Albanian Competition Authority intervened after Vodafone Albania, Telekom Albania, and ALBtelecom increased their tariffs by ALL 200 and doubled the minimum recharge value from ALL 100 to ALL 200. The move sparked strong reactions from consumers who felt that the high price increase across three of the main providers was unfair. The action was reported to the Competition Authority. The three companies took action to lower the prices, following the instructions given by the competition authority.
