## Activities


### Contests

Since 2008, the Fund has been holding the "Social Entrepreneur" all-Russian competition, during which the social projects are selected for providing targeted financial assistance. The first social entrepreneurship project received the support from the fund was the Dospehi [ru] company, which produces orthopedic systems for people with spinal cord injuries - they were allocated 9.5 million rubles in support (4 million were transferred free of charge, 5.5 million were given in the form of interest-free loan for working capital for a period of two years).

As of 2020, the competition has been running for 12 years, 254 projects from 58 regions of Russia have won interest-free cash loans for a total amount of 653.2 million rubles. Since 2018, the minimum amount of a loan has been increased from 500 thousand to 2 million rubles, and entrepreneurs participating in the competition were able to apply for loans up to 10 million rubles, on a par with the winners of previous years.

The stated goal of the transformation of the competition is to provide assistance to a number of regions in greatest need. As a result, the competition was divided into two: a competition for social impact projects, the winners of which are granted interest-free loans in the amount of 10 to 40 million rubles (30% of the total budget of the competition) for the purchase of real estate and equipment for up to 10 years, and a competition for social and entrepreneurial projects, following which interest-free loans are issued for the implementation of projects in the amount of 3 to 7 million rubles for a period of up to 5 years.
