## History

The company's history dates back to the foundation of Czech Property Investments a.s. (CPI a.s.) in 1991. Throughout the 1990s the company expanded its business abroad through acquisitions in Central Eastern Europe, across multiple real estate segments, including the acquisition of a residential portfolio in the Czech Republic in 2003.

In 2013, CPI a.s. acquired ABLON Group Limited, which owned a significant property portfolio in the CEE region. In 2014, CPI a.s. combined with Orco Property Group, the majority owner of Orco Germany, which owned a portfolio of office properties in Berlin. Following the company's name change to GSG Group, the company was renamed again to CPI Property Group. Since then, CPIPG has grown to become a leading European landlord with total assets exceeding €21 billion. The Group operated a well-diversified, large portfolio, which is supported by a conservative, investment-grade capital structure, with access to the international bond and bank markets.
