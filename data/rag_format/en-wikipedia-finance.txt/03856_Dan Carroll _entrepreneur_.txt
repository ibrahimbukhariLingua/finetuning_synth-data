## Education

## Career

In 2009, Carroll was a volunteer in Teach For America and deferred a job offer from Boston Consulting Group to teach. Afterward, he worked as a tech director at a STRIVE Preparatory School in Colorado. There, he found a lack of digital infrastructure to transfer information between apps and platforms, leading to lots of time-consuming manual inputs in order to set up new systems for students. In 2012, Carroll visited the San Francisco Bay Area where other colleagues working in education reported similar problems at their own schools. While there, he stayed with Bosmeny and decided to start a company with him.

That year, Carroll co-founded the education technology company, Clever, with Bosmeny and Garcia. Based on Carroll's observations of the lacking digital infrastructure in many American schools, Clever sought to make it easier for school systems to transfer their student data between apps and platforms. The same year of its founding, Clever was on-boarded to Y Combinator.

Carroll served as the company's chief product officer. Through the 2010s, Clever partnered with thousands of schools, millions of students, and earned approximately $60 million in funding alone while operating on a cash flow neutral basis starting in 2016. In 2014, Carroll and his co-founders were named in *Forbes*' Education 30 Under 30, and in 2017, Clever was ranked number four in The Wall Street Journal's Tech Companies to Watch.

In 2021, Kahoot! acquired Clever at a valuation of "$435 million to $500 million"; Clever remained an independent company while integrating with Kahoot! apps and augmenting its reach beyond the United States and toward the over 200 countries Kahoot! had already been operating in.

In December of 2024, Carroll joined the Education Advisory Board of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. He also serves on the boards of Teach for America and the Design Tech High School.
