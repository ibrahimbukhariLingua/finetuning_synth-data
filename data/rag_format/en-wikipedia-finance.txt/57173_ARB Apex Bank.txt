# ARB Apex Bank



**ARB Apex Bank** is a Ghanaian wholesale bank that provides funding and coordination to the Rural & Community Banks (RCBs) in Ghana. In effect it acts as a *mini central bank* to the Rural banks in Ghana. The acronym ARB stands for the Association of Rural Banks.

In Ghana, rural banks are financed mainly via the Rural Financial Services Project (RFSP), that is a project of the government to solve the operational problems of the rural financial sector.

Every Rural and Community bank in Ghana was mandated to contribute two thousand Ghana cedi to buy shares of the ARB – Apex bank Ltd, to enable the bank become accountable to the rural and community banks. So every rural and community bank in Ghana owns two thousand Ghana cedi worth of shares in Apex Bank. The remaining shares of the bank are also owned by the government of Ghana.
