## History


### Origins

Robinson Fresh has roots in fresh produce going back to 1905, when its parent company, C.H. Robinson, was founded in 1905 as a wholesale brokerage house, providing fresh produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota. Robinson Fresh has expanded and evolved its fresh products business through grower development, acquisitions, agreements with brands, and proprietary seed development. C.H. Robinson has since expanded into logistics and transportation services for a wide range of products and industries, which today includes relationships with over 66,000 transportation companies worldwide.


### Expansion and acquisitions in fresh produce market

Before the creation of Robinson Fresh, C.H. Robinson acquired several firms specializing in produce, temperature-controlled logistics, and delivery of fresh products, including FoodSource Procurement LLC, Rosemont Farms, and Timco Worldwide.


### Creation of Robinson Fresh

In May 2014, C.H. Robinson created Robinson Fresh as a business brand focused exclusively on the marketing and distributing of fresh produce to try and change perception of being tied to the parent CH Robinson business of brokering trucks. The launch of Robinson Fresh unified the acquired operations of FoodSource, Rosemont Farms, and Timco Worldwide—as well as the longstanding fresh produce business of C.H. Robinson itself—as a single, global business brand.
