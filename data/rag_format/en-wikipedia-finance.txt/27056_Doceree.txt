## History

Doceree was founded in 2020 by Harshit Jain, an alumnus of Northwestern University and a former physician in the United States. Harshit's career began in 2007 with Altruista Health, a startup using insurance data for health risk assessment and wellness promotion. In 2015, he sold Altruista Health to Capricorn Health Advisors. He later divested another venture, established in 2009 in India, to A.D.A.M. Ebix in 2016. Before founding Doceree, Dr. Jain worked with McCann Health as Vice President and Country Manager, taking on roles such as Innovation Lead across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In 2019,

Harshit left his position and founded Doceree. The company’s name, Doceree, is derived from the Latin word docere, meaning “to teach,” which is also the root of the word “doctor” in English. Doceree launched operations in 2020, initially in India and the U.S., before expanding into the UK, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the GCC countries. In June 2023, the company announced the launch of Doceree Enterprise, a demand-side platform focused on healthcare professionals.
