# Meridian Credit Union



**Meridian Credit Union Ltd.** is a Canadian credit union. It was formed on 1 April 2005 through the merger of Niagara Credit Union and HEPCOE (*Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario Employees*) Credit Union. It is insured by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario.


## History

Meridian is the second largest credit union in Canada, and the largest credit union in Ontario, with more than 378,000 members with total assets under administration of over $28.5 billion. Meridian offers banking, wealth management, credit products and services through 88 branches, and fifteen Commercial Business Centres.

Desjardins Credit Union (the Ontario affiliate of the Desjardins Group, formerly Province of Ontario Savings Office ) and Meridian's membership voted in favour of a merger effective 1 June 2011. By 2012, most of the former Desjardins branches in Ontario had been renamed to Meridian branches.
