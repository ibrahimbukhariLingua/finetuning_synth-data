## Questions about activities

Roman Kupchinsky, who immigrated from a refugee camp in Austria to Brooklyn, NY, in 1949 and worked for the CIA, was the director of the Ukrainian Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty from 1989 to 2002. He was a partner in the risk analysis firm AZEast Group until his death in 2010. In his 2008 appearance before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, overseen by Sen. Joe Biden, Kupchinsky testified:

> Gazprom, with the silent support of the Kremlin has set up 50 or so middlemen companies, silently linked to Gazprom and scattered throughout Europe - such as the Centrex group of companies and the Gazprom Germania network - which do not add any value to the price of Russian gas being sold on European markets; yet they earn enormous sums of money which appears to simply vanish through shell companies in Cyprus and in Liechtenstein.

German investigations have raised concerns about past connections between senior managers in the company, the East German government, and the Stasi.

European regulators (after the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute) insisted, foreign strategic energy supplies should operate under the EU law. Just as energies should be sold on the free market and not via direct contracts. Therefore, Gazprom was forced to set up a net of companies (middlemen) operating under EU law. During April 2021, Gazprom-associated gas storage facilities became unusually low and remained low instead of refilling in the off-peak summer season as usual. In late March 2022, Gazprom Group transferred ownership of Gazprom Germania which was then exited. The German authorities viewed the transfer as illegal for such critical infrastructure of the gas handling, and issued a legal order to control the assets of the former Gazprom Germania.

In May 2022, Russia issued sanctions against Gazprom Germania and other gas companies.

In August 2022, the German media learned that the German government had secretly created a company for the possible nationalization of SEFE. The company was originally called VERONIKA Zweiunddreizigste Vermögensverwaltungsgesellschaft, but on June 3, it was renamed Securing Energy for Europe Holding GmbH (SEEHG). The company's managing directors are two CMS Hasche Sigle lawyers. The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs has confirmed that they are aware of the company's founding. According to a spokesman for the ministry, the company was created "solely as a precautionary measure".

On November 14, 2022, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action decreed that the company would immediately be nationalized and full ownership was transferred to the German state. This action was previously authorized by the European Commission.


## Management

Until 2022, the CEO (Senior Managing Director, German: *Hauptgeschäftsführer*) of Gazprom Germania was Vladimir Kotenev [ru] (Russian: Владимир Котенев).
