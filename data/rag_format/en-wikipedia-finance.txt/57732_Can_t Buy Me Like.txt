## Synopsis

*Can't Buy Me Like*: How Authentic Customer Connections Drive Superior Results" is a 2013 book by Bob Garfield and Doug Levy that argues for a shift in marketing and advertising towards what the authors call the "Relationship Era." In this era, companies are encouraged to focus on building authentic, purpose-driven relationships with their customers, rather than relying solely on traditional advertising methods.

The book is organized into an introduction, 11 chapters, and an afterword, and is presented in a narrative format. It includes case studies from both large and small businesses, supported by public and proprietary data. Additionally, the book provides practical tools such as graphics, charts, and step-by-step guidelines aimed at helping businesses succeed in the Relationship Era. Central to the book’s thesis is the idea that companies must have a clear and genuine purpose in their branding to thrive in this new marketing paradigm.

In the introduction, the authors state: "At the most basic level, Can't Buy Me Like is a book about a simple truth: if you are still selling goods and services by blanketing the world with advertising, trying to persuade or entertain or flatter consumers into submission, you are doing things all wrong. Because the world has changed. A lot."

In many cases, these examples are of such ubiquitous brands that we can't help but see the immediate wisdom in the appraisal of the situation.
