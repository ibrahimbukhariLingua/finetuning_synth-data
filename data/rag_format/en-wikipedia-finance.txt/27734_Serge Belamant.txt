# Serge Belamant



**Serge Belamant** is a South African inventor and entrepreneur known for his contributions to cryptography technologies and financial systems. He is the founder of NET1 Technologies (now Lesaka Technologies) and played a significant role in the development of the Chip Offline Pre-authorized Card (COPAC) and the Universal Electronic Payment System (UEPS).


## Early life and education

Serge Belamant was born in 1953 and moved to South Africa at the age of 14. In 1972, he enrolled at Witwatersrand University, initially studying engineering before switching to computer science and applied mathematics. After two years, he discontinued his studies and pursued courses in information systems through UNISA (University of South Africa).


## Career

In 1989, Serge Belamant developed the Universal Electronic Payment System (UEPS), enabling secure, real-time transactions even in areas with limited connectivity. In the same year, he founded NET1 UEPS Technologies Inc., serving as its CEO and Director.

In 1995, VISA tasked Belamant with designing the Chip Offline Pre-authorized Card (COPAC), a technology still widely used in chip-enabled credit and debit cards. A year later, he listed his company APLITEC (Applied Technology Holdings Limited) on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.

In 1999, Belamant acquired Cash Payment Services (CPS) from First National Bank of South Africa, modernizing its welfare payment system to serve millions in rural areas.

In 2005, he led NET1 Technologies to an IPO, listing it as NET1 UEPS Technologies Inc. on the Nasdaq. A secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) followed in 2008.

Under Belamant's leadership, NET1 managed welfare payments for the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), handling payments for over 10 million beneficiaries monthly. Despite criticism over handling the SASSA contract, investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the South African Constitutional Court found no wrongdoing.

Belamant retired in 2017, leaving NET1 with over 10,000 pay points and annual transaction volumes of 160 billion rand—15 to 20% of South Africa's national budget.

In 2018, he co-founded Zilch Technology, a direct-to-consumer ad-subsidized payments network, alongside Philip Belamant and Sean O’Connor.
