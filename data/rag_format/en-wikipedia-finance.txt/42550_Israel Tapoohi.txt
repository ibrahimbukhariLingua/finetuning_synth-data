## Public service

Tapoohi has held a number of key advisory positions, all of which were on a volunteer basis. From 1996 to 1999 he was Benjamin Netanyahu's liaison to foreign investors and coordinated the think-tank that advised the prime minister's office on economic policy.

During this same period, Tapoohi was the Likud Party treasurer, also on a voluntary basis, from May 1993 through April 1997, and, in 1998, co-chaired the 50th Anniversary Jubilee Conference for Business Investment in Israel.

As part of the formation of the second Netanyahu government in March 2009, Tapoohi was appointed to the '100 Days Team.' Together with Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz, Tapoohi developed guidelines and policies to keep Israel's economy resilient in the face of ongoing global recession. From May 2009 to May 2011, Tapoohi was part of a forum of businessmen, economists and academics advising the Finance Ministry on macro-economic policy.

Tapoohi was a member of the Council and Advisory Committee of the Bank of Israel and the Committee of the Association of Publicly Listed Companies on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

Through December 2010, Tapoohi was a member of the directorate of the Israel-British Chamber of Commerce, and, from 2004 to 2006, was a member of the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce.


## Israel Bonds

Following a recommendation from then-Finance Minister Steinitz, the board of directors of Development Corporation for Israel approved Tapoohi's appointment as president and CEO. He officially began his new role October 31, 2011.

During his time with the organization, Tapoohi stressed the strength of Israel's economy. In an interview published November 4, 2014, on Bloomberg.com, Tapoohi said, “It’s an economic narrative that we’re giving today, and not a geopolitical one.”

The Bloomberg article noted Tapoohi's use of technology to assist Bonds registered representatives in increasing annual U.S. sales. In 2013 and ’14, domestic sales exceeded $1.1 billion, with reinvestment rates of approximately 60 percent. U.S. sales again exceeded $1 billion in 2015.

Previously, in an op-ed published in the January 8, 2014, issue of the Jerusalem Post, Tapoohi wrote: “Every day, Israel Bonds emphasizes the message that Israel’s economy is dynamic, full of innovative spirit and groundbreaking entrepreneurship. It is a message that has resonated with Israel Bonds clients from across the spectrum who invest in Israel bonds to become stakeholders in one of the world’s most resilient economies."

Prior to 2012, Tapoohi's first full year with Israel Bonds, annual U.S. sales had remained in the $600 million range for several years. In his first year, sales topped $800 million, followed by three consecutive years (2013-2015) of domestic sales exceeding $1 billion.

He prioritized the organization's digital presence, particularly its e-commerce site, which, since its launch in fall 2011, has resulted in over $125 million in sales to date, encompassing more than 50,000 bondholders.

Together with the utilization of new technologies, Tapoohi ensured that the Bonds organization maintained personal contact with all clients via a national call center that proactively interacts with hundreds of clients each week, as well as through digital communication. He has also focused on enhanced levels of customer service.

Tapoohi also emphasized the need to attract a new generation to Israel Bonds, stating this was "a foremost priority" for the organization.

Additionally, he launched an initiative to counter anti-Israel activism on campus. Entitled *"The Alternative BDS - **B**onds **D**onated to **S**chools,"* the program encouraged donations of Israel bonds to universities.


## Personal life

Tapoohi is married to Regina (formerly Lossak), who was a senior attorney at Israel's Justice Ministry working the field of trans-border criminal law. In September 2013, she was named senior delegate to the UN on behalf of the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, and she continues to serve in that capacity on a volunteer basis. She was elected to the association's board of governors in November 2014. They have three daughters and one son.
