Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan


# Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan



**Hajj Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan** (Arabic: موسى بن عبد الرحمن بن حسن الرئيسي) was an Omani businessman, tribal leader, and landlord. He was born in the old town of Muscat and finished his studies in the American Mission School. He established a firm in 1927 in supplying coals and foodstuffs to British ships & frigates in Muscat.


## Postal services

Haji Moosa was one of the pioneer users and establishers of the Post Office Box in the Sultanate of Oman. Omanis abroad (especially East Africa, other Gulf States and India) used to send him mails to his personal mailbox and he used to deliver them to people later on, hence it was like a public address for anyone to use. The company still maintains the same P.O. Box 4 Muscat.


## Banking and finance

Hajj Moosa also established a money transfer service between the 1940s and 1960s through his well established and recognized P.O. Box 4 Muscat, which functionally operated as a first money transferring and wiring service hub for many Omanis who were living and working in East Africa, Gulf States and India. This complimentary service was introduced to aid Omanis, who were living abroad back then, to send and receive money, as it proved difficult due to the lack of professional and commercial banking services at that time. It is worth mentioning, this free of charge financial service was provided well before Western Union was established in the region.
Furthermore, he was a founding member and the local director of The British Bank of The Middle East, which was established in 1948. The bank is one of the oldest banks not only in the Oman, but also in the entire region. Later on in the mid 1970s, he was involved in establishing Bank of Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait, which was a joined venture with Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait (BBK).


## Business and trade

Muscat, well through the early to mid part of the 20th century, was recognized as the center of trade between the Arabian Peninsula, Indian Coast, East Africa and other parts of Oman. Hajj Moosa traded variety of goods including dates, dried fish and timber. Furthermore, he housed the travelling traders in his residence, which later on was converted to a hall that is used to host various social occasions.

Due to his involvement of trading in kerosene, which was the main source of energy at that time, Hajj Moosa was chosen by The British Petroleum Company (BP) to become their representative in Oman. He owned a network of BP filling stations in Muscat and Batinah's coast.

He also got into a partnership with the British Gary McKenzie, and Oman's W.J.Towell & Co., which formed Gary McKenzie Moosa Towell Group Of Companies, which later became Oman United Agencies. The company catered for supplies and logistics for oil companies in Oman, as well as having a foodstuff division and a travel agency. Hajj Moosa originally formed the company in 1956 before it partnered up with other partners.

Moosa Furniture, which was the furnishing arm of the establishment, successfully did furnishing projects for many ministries and government owned organizations especially in the 1970s.
Hajj Moosa also represented brands such as Canon cameras and Eterna Matic Swiss watches in the Omani market throughout the 1970s, until these agencies were sold to other merchants in the early 1980s.
