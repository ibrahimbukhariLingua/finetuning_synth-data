1994 Canadian federal budget


# 1994 Canadian federal budget



The **Canadian federal budget** *’*for fiscal year 1994–95 was presented by Minister of Finance Paul Martin in the House of Commons of Canada on 22 February 1994. It was the first federal budget under the premiership of Jean Chrétien.


## Background

The budget is tabled only a few months after the 1993 Canadian federal election in which the Liberal Party led by Jean Chrétien received a large majority of the seats in the House of Commons. Paul Martin, Chrétien's main rival in the 1990 Liberal Party leadership election was appointed Minister of Finance.


### February 8 Prime Ministerial Statement

On 8 February 1994 the prime minister Jean Chrétien delivered a surprise prime ministerial statement in the House of Commons to announce a federal action plan on tobacco smuggling:

> Therefore, much as we may all regret the necessity of lowering cigarette taxes, we must do so at least until we have put the smuggling networks out of business. Then we will be able to restore the appropriate level of taxation that the situation needs.
> 
> — Jean Chrétien

Excise taxes on tobacco are dramatically reduced, with additional reduction in provinces that agrees to reduce their provincial excise taxes. Additional excise taxes are to be imposed on exported tobacco products, along with a surtax on tobacco manufacturing profits.


## Taxes


### Personal income taxes

The budget reduced or repealed several tax incentives:

* The $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption is repealed;
* The first $25,000 of employer-provided life insurance is to be considered a taxable benefits;
* The age tax credit is reduced;
* Only 50% of meals and entertainment expenses may be deducted (down from 80% pre-budget).

### Corporate income taxes

The budget also reduced several tax incentives:

* Investment Tax Credits rates are reduced;
 + The *Special Investment Tax Credit* and the regional component in respect of R&D are eliminated;
* R&D expenses and the small business deduction calculations are tightened for private corporations;
* New rules are implemented to limit tax avoidance during divisive corporate reorganizations.

### GST and other taxes

Along with the reduction in the deductibility of meals and entertainment expenses, the proportion of GST that can be claimed on these expenses as an input tax credit is also reduced to 50%.


## Expenditures


### Transfers to provinces

The budget announced the freezing of Canada Assistance Plan (CAP) payments to their 1994-95 levels after March 31, 1995. Unlike the 1990 restrictions, all provinces (including those receiving equalization payments) are affected by the cap.

The Reform Party (then the third party by number of seats in the House) supported reductions to the CAP while criticizing that the cutbacks are not matched by amendments to health national standards to give more freedom to provinces in adjusting the services they provide.
