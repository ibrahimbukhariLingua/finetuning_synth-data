## Art collection

Since 1994, Daskalopoulos has been a collector of contemporary art and put together the D.Daskalopoulos Collection. His first contemporary purchase was *The Painting in the Inner Egg* (1993) by Rebecca Horn. On 17 November 1999, he notably purchased a limited-edition replica of Marcel Duchamp's *Fountain* (owned by Arturo Schwarz) was sold at Sotheby's, New York, for $1.8 million; Daskalopoulos declared that *Fountain* represented the origin of contemporary art. The price set a world record, at the time, for a work by Duchamp at public auction. The collection now comprises over 500 works by 170 artists, including Matthew Barney, Louise Bourgeois, Damien Hirst, Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy, and Kiki Smith.

In 2003, Daskalopoulos made a joint acquisition with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum of Barney’s sculpture *Chrysler Imperial* (2002); it now belongs fully to the museum.

Daskalopoulos is also a Vice President of the Board of Trustees of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation; Chairman of the Collections Council of the Solomon R.

Thematic exhibitions based on the collection have been presented at the Whitechapel Gallery, London (2010-2011), the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao (2011) and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh (2012-2013). In 2010, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao came under fire for announcing its plans for a show consisting of 60 works from the D.Daskalopoulos Collection, with critics claiming that a board member had too much curatorial control over programming, allowing his works to increase in value do to a high-profile exhibition. The museum countered by insisting that no works shown in the show, “The Luminous Interval,” could be sold for three years.

In April 2022, Daskalopoulos announced a gift of some 350 artworks by 142 artists; in addition to giving 140 pieces to Athens’s National Museum of Contemporary Art (EMST) and 110 to Tate, around 100 works are to be shared by the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.
