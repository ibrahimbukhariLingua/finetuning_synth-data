## History

ARC Ltd is a hybrid mutual insurer and financial affiliate of the African Risk Capacity Group. It was established in 2014 with a specific commercial mandate as a Bermuda Class 2 mutual insurance company with seed capital funding from UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), and Germany’s KfW through BMZ. Eventually, ARC Ltd is wholly owned by African sovereigns. The mandate of ARC Ltd is to create customized parametric insurance solutions against climate and health risks. Since its inception, ARC Ltd has successfully underwritten ten annual risk pools and is currently Africa’s largest provider of parametric insurance.


## Vision and mission

ARC Ltd provides parametric insurance services to member states of the African Union and farmer organizations, employing innovative financing mechanisms to pool disaster-related risk across Africa and transferring it to international risk markets. By transferring the burden of natural disaster risks away from governments and their populations, ARC Ltd facilitates a deliberated response approach to disasters. It disburses financing to fund pre-approved contingency plans to respond rapidly and predictably to disasters.
