## History

The National Life Office Management Association "in the early nineteen thirties was one of the first management societies or trade associations to assign an increasingly prominent role to some kind of selective records preservation in the programs of their annual meetings and in the work projects of their research groups."

LOMA developed a series of merit rating scales for clerical employees based on traits and behavioral elements, published in 1950.
