## History

The company was founded in 2010 by Gustaf Agartson in Ghana. During pre-launch conversations with potential customers, Agartson asked audiences who typically would not buy insurance what motivated their decision to buy. Agartson’s solution was to get rid of almost all exclusions, and add minimal requirements to plans.

It was originally created to provide insurance by leveraging increased smartphone penetration and the spread of e-wallets, it later widened its services to include telemedicine consultation and other health solutions. Since its founding, it has seen revenues grow at a 63% CAGR. According to Milvik, its addressable market based on the countries it is located in was 500 million. Its founder, Gustaf Agartson, believes that insurance and healthcare in emerging markets is a major opportunity.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
