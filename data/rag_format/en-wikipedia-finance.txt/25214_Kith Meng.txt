# Kith Meng



**Kith Meng** (Khmer: គិត ម៉េង; Chinese: 陈丰明) is the Chairman and CEO of Royal Group of Companies. Established in 1991, Cambodia’s strategic investment holding company, the Royal Group is recognized as the country’s most dynamic and diversified business conglomerate with interests in a wide range of industries.


## Early life and education

Meng is the youngest of three sons of Chinese Cambodian businessman Kith Peng Ike. He lived in Kandal Province until 1975 when the advent of the Khmer Rouge regime caused major social upheaval. His family were among those targeted by the Khmer Rouge because of their wealth, ethnicity and socio-economic status. The entire family was sent to a labour camp where, upon arrival, Meng and his two brothers were separated from their parents who later died of starvation. During the confusion resulting from the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, Meng escaped with his older brother Sophan Kith to Phnom Penh, from which they then fled for the refugee camps in Thailand in 1980. In Thailand, Meng later related, “They put us in a pig farm...we slept with the pigs...we no longer existed; we had no state, nothing." Meng then immigrated to Australia settling in Canberra in 1981.

Meng studied at Melba High School and then received a degree in economics from Australian National University. He worked several jobs in Canberra including selling Kodak film and then in financial services before returning to Cambodia at the start of the UNTAC administration in the early 1990’s.

Meng saw the devastation the war had caused and decided to stay committed to rebuilding the nation.


## Career

In 1991, Meng returned to Cambodia, where he and his older brother Sophan Kith began selling furniture and office supplies to the UN and operated a Canon copiers franchise before establishing The Royal Group. Sophan died in 1994, and Meng took over as head of The Royal Group. Meng forged joint ventures between Cambodian and international companies. Given his dealings in importing telecommunications equipment, this gave him the opportunity in 1996 to partner with Millicom International Cellular SA to jointly own and establish the 1st mobile operator in Cambodia called CamGSM Co. Ltd (Cellcard).

Meng’s strategic partnerships and investments have introduced advanced technologies and business practices to the country, enhancing its global economic integration. Meng’s influence extends across several critical sectors. He has been instrumental in attracting foreign investments, facilitating technological transfers, and promoting economic modernization.

In 2008, Meng unseated Sok Kong as President of Cambodia's Chamber Of Commerce. He was reelected in 2023 for his fifth 3-year term.

## Politics

Commentators have compared Meng to other well-known Asian tycoons including Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and Thailand's Thaksin Shinawatra. However, Meng has downplayed suggestions he may one day stand for Prime Minister, saying, "leave politics to the politicians". Still, Meng often accompanies Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen abroad to help promote Cambodia's economic interests and is a strong supporter of Hun Sen. Meng carries the honorary title of "Neak Oknha", a title bestowed by the Royal Family on those who make contributions of $10,000,000 or more.
