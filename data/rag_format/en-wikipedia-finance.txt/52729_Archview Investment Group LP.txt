Archview was part of a group of creditors to offer a $1 billion loan to Puerto Rico in 2017, during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The loan was rejected by the Puerto Rican fiscal agency for unfavorable conditions.

In December 2017, Bloomberg News reported that the firm was shutting down and would begin returning money to investors the following year.
