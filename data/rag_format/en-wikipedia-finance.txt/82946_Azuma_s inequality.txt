Azuma's inequality


# Azuma's inequality



In probability theory, the **Azuma–Hoeffding inequality** (named after Kazuoki Azuma and Wassily Hoeffding) gives a concentration result for the values of martingales that have bounded differences.

Suppose {\displaystyle \{X\_{k}:k=0,1,2,3,\dots \}} is a martingale (or super-martingale) and

almost surely. Then for all positive integers *N* and all positive reals *{\displaystyle \epsilon }*,

And symmetrically (when *X*ₖ is a sub-martingale):

If *X* is a martingale, using both inequalities above and applying the union bound allows one to obtain a two-sided bound:


## Proof

The proof shares similar idea of the proof for the general form of Azuma's inequality listed below. Actually, this can be viewed as a direct corollary of the general form of Azuma's inequality.


## A general form of Azuma's inequality


### Limitation of the vanilla Azuma's inequality

Note that the vanilla Azuma's inequality requires symmetric bounds on martingale increments, i.e. {\displaystyle -c\_{t}\leq X\_{t}-X\_{t-1}\leq c\_{t}}. So, if known bound is asymmetric, e.g. {\displaystyle a\_{t}\leq X\_{t}-X\_{t-1}\leq b\_{t}}, to use Azuma's inequality, one need to choose {\displaystyle c\_{t}=\max(|a\_{t}|,|b\_{t}|)} which might be a waste of information on the boundedness of {\displaystyle X\_{t}-X\_{t-1}}. However, this issue can be resolved and one can obtain a tighter probability bound with the following general form of Azuma's inequality.


### Statement

Let {\displaystyle \left\{X\_{0},X\_{1},\cdots \right\}} be a martingale (or supermartingale) with respect to filtration {\displaystyle \left\{{\mathcal {F}}\_{0},{\mathcal {F}}\_{1},\cdots \right\}}. Assume there are predictable processes {\displaystyle \left\{A\_{0},A\_{1},\cdots \right\}} and {\displaystyle \left\{B\_{0},B\_{1},\dots \right\}} with respect to {\displaystyle \left\{{\mathcal {F}}\_{0},{\mathcal {F}}\_{1},\cdots \right\}}, i.e. for all {\displaystyle t}, {\displaystyle A\_{t},B\_{t}} are {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\_{t-1}}-measurable, and constants {\displaystyle 0<c\_{1},c\_{2},\cdots <\infty } such that

almost surely. Then for all {\displaystyle \epsilon >0},

Since a submartingale is a supermartingale with signs reversed, we have if instead {\displaystyle \left\{X\_{0},X\_{1},\dots \right\}} is a martingale (or submartingale),

If {\displaystyle \left\{X\_{0},X\_{1},\dots \right\}} is a martingale, since it is both a supermartingale and submartingale, by applying union bound to the two inequalities above, we could obtain the two-sided bound:


### Proof

We will prove the supermartingale case only as the rest are self-evident. By Doob decomposition, we could decompose supermartingale {\displaystyle \left\{X\_{t}\right\}} as {\displaystyle X\_{t}=Y\_{t}+Z\_{t}} where {\displaystyle \left\{Y\_{t},{\mathcal {F}}\_{t}\right\}} is a martingale and {\displaystyle \left\{Z\_{t},{\mathcal {F}}\_{t}\right\}} is a nonincreasing predictable sequence (Note that if {\displaystyle \left\{X\_{t}\right\}} itself is a martingale, then {\displaystyle Z\_{t}=0}). From {\displaystyle A\_{t}\leq X\_{t}-X\_{t-1}\leq B\_{t}}, we have

Applying Chernoff bound to {\displaystyle Y\_{n}-Y\_{0}}, we have for {\displaystyle \epsilon >0},

For the inner expectation term, since

(i) {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} [Y\_{t}-Y\_{t-1}\mid {\mathcal {F}}\_{t-1}]=0} as {\displaystyle \left\{Y\_{t}\right\}} is a martingale;

(ii) {\displaystyle -(Z\_{t}-Z\_{t-1})+A\_{t}\leq Y\_{t}-Y\_{t-1}\leq -(Z\_{t}-Z\_{t-1})+B\_{t}};

(iii) {\displaystyle -(Z\_{t}-Z\_{t-1})+A\_{t}} and {\displaystyle -(Z\_{t}-Z\_{t-1})+B\_{t}} are both {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\_{t-1}}-measurable as {\displaystyle \left\{Z\_{t}\right\}} is a predictable process;

(iv) {\displaystyle B\_{t}-A\_{t}\leq c\_{t}};

by applying Hoeffding's lemma, we have

Repeating this step, one could get

Note that the minimum is achieved at {\displaystyle s={\frac {4\epsilon }{\sum \_{t=1}^{n}c\_{t}^{2}}}}, so we have

Finally, since {\displaystyle X\_{n}-X\_{0}=(Y\_{n}-Y\_{0})+(Z\_{n}-Z\_{0})} and {\displaystyle Z\_{n}-Z\_{0}\leq 0} as {\displaystyle \left\{Z\_{n}\right\}} is nonincreasing, so event {\displaystyle \left\{X\_{n}-X\_{0}\geq \epsilon \right\}} implies {\displaystyle \left\{Y\_{n}-Y\_{0}\geq \epsilon \right\}}, and therefore


### Remark

Note that by setting {\displaystyle A\_{t}=-c\_{t},B\_{t}=c\_{t}}, we could obtain the vanilla Azuma's inequality.

Note that for either submartingale or supermartingale, only one side of Azuma's inequality holds. We can't say much about how fast a submartingale with bounded increments rises (or a supermartingale falls).

This general form of Azuma's inequality applied to the Doob martingale gives McDiarmid's inequality which is common in the analysis of randomized algorithms.


## Simple example of Azuma's inequality for coin flips

Let *F*ᵢ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random coin flips (i.e., let *F*ᵢ be equally likely to be −1 or 1 independent of the other values of *F*ᵢ). Defining {\displaystyle X\_{i}=\sum \_{j=1}^{i}F\_{j}} yields a martingale with |*X*ₖ − *X*ₖ−₁| ≤ 1, allowing us to apply Azuma's inequality. Specifically, we get

For example, if we set *t* proportional to *n*, then this tells us that although the *maximum* possible value of *X*ₙ scales linearly with *n*, the *probability* that the sum scales linearly with *n* decreases exponentially fast with *n*.

If we set {\displaystyle t={\sqrt {2n\ln n}}} we get:

which means that the probability of deviating more than {\displaystyle {\sqrt {2n\ln n}}} approaches 0 as *n* goes to infinity.


## Remark

A similar inequality was proved under weaker assumptions by Sergei Bernstein in 1937.

Hoeffding proved this result for independent variables rather than martingale differences, and also observed that slight modifications of his argument establish the result for martingale differences (see page 9 of his 1963 paper).
