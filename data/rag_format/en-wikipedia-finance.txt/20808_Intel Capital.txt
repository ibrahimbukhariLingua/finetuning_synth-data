## History

Established by Les Vadasz in 1991, Intel Capital (originally named Corporate Business Development) was the first corporate venture capital firm. It was first created to support the development of Intel's ecosystem through equity investments in strategic companies. Many of these companies were engaged in the manufacture and development of chips, equipment, and software that fueled the demand for high-end personal computers. Intel Capital now makes investments internationally across North America, Western Europe, Israel, and Asia Pacific.

Intel Capital curates thousands of customer introductions each year between its portfolio companies and the Global 2000. With more than US$20 billion invested over three decades, Intel Capital has become the world's largest corporate venture firm dedicated to advancing the future of compute.
