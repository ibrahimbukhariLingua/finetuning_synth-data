University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law


# University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law



The ***University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law*** is a scholarly journal focusing on issues of business law, corporate governance, securities regulation, capital markets regulation, the law of mergers and acquisitions, and employment law. The *Journal* is published four times annually by an organization of second and third year law students at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. The journal is one of six major scholarly journals at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and one of the top five most cited business law journals in the United States.


## History

The *Journal of Business Law* is an expansion of the *Journal of Labor and Employment Law*, which has published focused and cutting-edge scholarship since 1997. Building upon more than a decade of successful contribution to legal academia, the *Journal* now also provides a forum for scholarly analysis addressing all aspects of business law. Now on its 21st Volume, the Journal has become one of the premier destinations for business-related legal scholarship. The *Journal of Business Law* is published in four standard issues each year.


## Member selection

Positions on the journal are filled based in part on students' grades during first year of law school and in part on students' performance during a writing competition conducted at the end of each school year. The writing competition has two major parts: an editing portion and a writing portion. During the 20-hour editing portion, contestants are required to correct a sample portion of a fake law review article. Contestants have at their disposal a copy of the Bluebook and a packet of source materials provided by the journal. During the writing portion, contestants are required to create a cohesive, thesis-driven essay using only these source materials. The sources cover a variety of topics, and the essay does not need to be law-related.
