## History

Caricel was started in March 2014 when Symbiote applied for a Carrier and Service Provider licence from the Office of Utilities Regulation (OUR) in Jamaica. In February 2016, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Energy and Mining (MSTEM) announced that a new mobile network operator licence was being considered by the Jamaican Government. Despite a change in administration between the announcement and granting the licence in May, Caricel was approved for a Spectrum licence.

They invested over US$50 million in deployment and is looking at spending another US$50 million over the next 3 years.
