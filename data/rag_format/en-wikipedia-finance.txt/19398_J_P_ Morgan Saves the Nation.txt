J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation


# J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation



***J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation*** is a 1995 musical with a book by Jeffrey M. Jones and music and lyrics by Jonathan Larson.

Jonathan Larson was invited to compose music for En Garde Arts‘s production of Jeffrey M. Jones’ *J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation*, a postmodern work detailing the life of financier J. P. Morgan. Larson was called in as a replacement as Jones' long-time collaborator, Dan Moses Schreier, dropped out, suggested by artistic director Annie Hamburger after hearing a recording of the workshop production of *Rent* at New York Theatre Workshop.


## Development

Ron Chernow's *The House of Morgan* was a major historical source for the team during development.

The score for *J.P. Morgan* contains "Larson’s musical recipe" including classic composer John Philip Sousa, soul, Seattle-inspired music, and electric-guitar-heavy grunge. Meanwhile, *Entertainment Weekly* described it as a "ragtime-to-rock satire". Larson not only wrote new songs for the show but re-worked some of his older songs, particularly "Greenback Dollars," "Jack O'Diamonds," and "Run that Railroad" (which had its origins in an early song for *RENT*).

The show was staged at the "pointedly appropriate setting" of the Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street, which was across the street from the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, founded by the titular character. Due to the nature of the location, background checks were performed on the actors.

## Critical reception

According to *The Atlantic*, *J.P. Morgan Saves the Nation,* along with Larson's other shows *Superbia* and *Tick, Tick... Boom!*, "opened and closed quickly, in out-of-the-way venues". *The New York Times* noted the piece's "intricate, even esoteric book...obviously the product of many hours of library research" and "peppy score in a post-modernist medley of musical voices".

Reviews were mixed to negative, despite a positive review from Ben Brantley at *The New York Times*, and the show closed a week early.
