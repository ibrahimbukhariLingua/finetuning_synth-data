## History

PeoplesBank is a branch bank incorporated on March 19, 1885 as *Peoples Savings Bank*. Its first president was William Skinner of William Skinner and Sons Silk, who would serve as the bank's president from its founding until 1901, a year before his passing. A number of prominent figures in Holyoke's founding would work for the bank, including architect George P. B. Alderman, who sat on its board, and Judge John Hildreth, as a clerk, whose Oakdale estate, the Yankee Pedlar, was reopened as a branch of the bank in 2019. It was first headquartered in Downtown Holyoke, Massachusetts with an additional office in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1974, the bank would expand its headquarters with a large Brutalist commercial block at the corners of High and Suffolk Streets as part of a city revitalization campaign, where it maintains a branch today.

By October 2003, it formally changed its name to PeoplesBank, and operates as a subsidiary of PeoplesBancorp, MHC (Holyoke, MA), out of headquarters by the Holyoke Mall at 330 Whitney Avenue, formerly the offices of Community Savings Bank.
