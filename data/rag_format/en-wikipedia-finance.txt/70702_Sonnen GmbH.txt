Sonnen GmbH


# Sonnen GmbH



**sonnen GmbH** (proprietary name and abbreviated form: **sonnen**) is a company in the energy industry headquartered in Wildpoldsried in the district of Oberallgäu, Germany. It produces home energy storage systems for private households and small businesses. The company is considered the market leader in Germany and additional international markets. Moreover, it is the center of a community for supplying power from renewable energies.


## Company development


### Company

Christoph Ostermann and Torsten Stiefenhofer founded the company in 2010 as a GmbH (German limited liability company). The legal name of the company at that time was *PROSOL Invest Deutschland GmbH*. In December 2013, the shareholders' meeting decided to change the company name to *sonnenBatterie GmbH*, in order to adopt the name of its product range and to support the goal of internationalization. Since November 2015, the company has operated as *sonnen,* under which all the company's individual activities are organized.


### Business development

From 2008 to 2010 above all founder Torsten Stiefenhofer developed a home battery marketed from 2011 under the name of *sonnenBatterie*. As a solar battery, the product is geared especially to independent homeowners with a photovoltaic system. As of mid-2016, eight generations of this power storage system have been developed and marketed. Germany is the main sales market for the devices. The company also distributes the home batteries in Austria, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, the United States and Australia (current as of: October 2016).

Along with the renaming of the company to *Sonnen GmbH*, the company announced in November 2015 that starting in 2016, it would establish its own power community, whose members can trade power among themselves. Since September 2016, owners of a *sonnenBatterie*, who are a member of this power community, can obtain electricity at a flat rate.

At the beginning of May 2017, TenneT and *sonnen* announced their plans to implement decentralized photovoltaic domestic storage batteries using blockchain technology to help stabilize the power grid and improve the integration of renewable energies. This offers a new source of income to *sonnen* customers who take part in the system. Furthermore, the planned blockchain pilot project is meant to improve and simplify the networking of storage batteries, photovoltaic systems and power grids, as well as make them more efficient. From an economic perspective, this technology and sonnen’s battery pool (*sonnenCommunity*) could reduce the redispatching costs for stabilizing the power grid.


## Business fields


### Power storage

Like other home storage systems, the *sonnenBatterie* from *sonnen* is also designed to increase the rate of own consumption of self-produced energy. Usually, a level of self-consumption of 30 to 55 percent can be reached with a photovoltaic system, when using smart-home functions. With a storage system, this rate is around 60 to 80 percent, as the self-produced electricity can be stored until it is consumed within the household. There is less need to source external electricity, especially mornings or evenings.

Since its market launch, the company has designed the *sonnenBatterie* as a fully integrated system. In addition to the battery modules, it has an integrated power inverter, a unit for power management, along with electronic meters for power consumption in the building, for photovoltaic power generation and for feeding power into the grid or power-sharing in connection with the *sonnenCommunity*. The power management system evaluates the user's consumption data and takes weather statistics into account, in order to determine the optimal time intervals for charging and discharging the storage system. Moreover, the *sonnenBatterie* can be combined with heat pumps, small wind turbines or combined heat and power plants.

The storage elements deployed are lithium iron phosphate batteries. Sony is the main supplier of these components. The various models of the system differ above all in their rated capacity, expressed in kilowatt hours. In Germany, *Sonnen* was one of the first suppliers of lithium-ion batteries for stationary use in homes and is considered market leader in Germany and globally. Products are not distributed via wholesale trade but through selected specialty dealers. From 2011 to mid-October 2016, 15,000 units were sold. Most went to homeowners, along with farmers and small businesses.


### Community

Since the first quarter of the year 2016, the company has organized the *sonnenCommunity*. It involves a power producer community of photovoltaic system operators (homeowners and small business owners), who share surplus power with one another. In order to fill any power gaps in times when there is less sunlight, biogas systems are also included. Operators of small wind generators can also supply the community with power.

The community combines three elements: the use of decentralized power generation, modern battery storage technology and digital networking of the participants. The concept is geared towards *sonnen* customers. The company grants prospective members a discount on the *sonnenBatterie* if they join the community. All members source power from the community at prices lower than from the grid. Moreover, *sonnen* handles the sale of surplus community power for them.

By building up and expanding the community, the company hopes to boost sales of its *sonnenBatterie*. Besides, each community member pays a monthly fee to *sonnen*. The company in return handles the metering infrastructure and the software.

The number of members at the beginning of October 2016 was around 3,000 households. In May 2016, the company began building up the community in Austria. The launch of the Swiss customer platform is announced for the 3rd quarter of 2016.

Since September 2016, owners of a *sonnenBatterie* who are members of the *sonnenCommunity* can obtain electricity at a flat rate.


## Shareholders
