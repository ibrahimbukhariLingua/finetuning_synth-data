# Public Law 113-167



**Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 113–167 (text) (PDF)** (formerly the bill **H.R. 2600**), a United States public law, that is entitled "to amend the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act to clarify how the Act applies to condominiums," is a bill that was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968 was passed in 1968 with the intention of helping protect consumers from land-related scams, but regulating the sale of land across state lines. The act requires sellers to prepare center information about the piece of property they are trying to sell and disclose it in a "Property Report." The law was originally administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, but is currently run by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. H.R. 2600 would make changes to this law related to condominiums.
