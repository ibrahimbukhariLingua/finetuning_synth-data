# Analytik Jena



**Analytik Jena GmbH+Co. KG**, based in Jena (Thuringia, Germany), is a provider of analytical, bioanalytical and optical systems for industrial and scientific applications. Analytik Jena was founded in 1990 as a sales and service company for analytical technology. The company has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange from July 3, 2000 until March 27, 2015. Analytik Jena and its subsidiaries employ about 1,000 people in more than 90 countries. The international Group earns two-thirds of sales abroad and maintains business relationships in more than 120 countries around the globe.


## History

Analytik Jena was founded jointly by Klaus Berka along with Jens Adomat in 1990, shortly after East Germany's peaceful revolution. At the beginning, the two former Zeiss employees managed the distribution of analytical measuring instruments, primarily in Thuringia, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.

In 1994, first shares in IDC Geräteentwicklungsgesellschaft mbH Langewiesen were acquired, a company whose products Analytik Jena had been selling since 1992. Due to the purchase of the laboratory analysis technology of Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH at the end of 1995, the Company's market share in the instrument business increased further. Analytik Jena had become a manufacturing company in the analytical technology segment, laying the foundation for the “Analytical Instrumentation” business unit. This acquisition marked the beginning of the research and development of analytical systems in the area of atomic absorption spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy.

On July 3, 2000, the shares of Analytik Jena AG were traded for the first time on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's “Neuer Markt” segment. In this way, important liquidity for the further expansion of sales activity and the advancement of research and development was secured. In the subsequent years, Analytik Jena enforced its growth path due to strategic acquisitions, the expansion of international sales activities and the founding of subsidiaries in Germany and abroad. After expanding to Eastern and Western Europe and to the US, Analytik Jena has grown significantly in Asia. Especially China is an important foreign market of the Company.

In order to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the biotechnology market, Analytik Jena has found its third business unit “Life Science”. With the acquisition of Biometra GmbH, CyBio AG, and the US company UVP, LLC the Company expanded its product portfolio.

One of the most important business acquisitions in the history of Analytik Jena AG has been closed in 2014. With this acquisition, the Company entered the rapidly growing global ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) market. Analytik Jena thereby further broadened its atomic spectroscopy portfolio and is among the few suppliers that offer all three core technologies for elemental trace analysis (AAS, ICP-OES, and ICP-MS).

Today, Swiss group Endress+Hauser has the majority holding of Analytik Jena AG. In September 2015, Endress+Hauser submitted the squeeze-out request to the Analytik Jena AG. At this time, Endress+Hauser held a stake of 96.18% in the share capital of Analytik Jena AG. Since March 27, 2015, the shares of the Jena AG are no longer listed on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
