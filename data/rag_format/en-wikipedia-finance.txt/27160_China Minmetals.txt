## History

Minmetals' sales network is worldwide. It operates more than 100 offices in China and more than 40 companies abroad. China Minmetals Corporation was founded in 1950.

Minmetals, parent of Hong Kong-listed Minmetals Resources Ltd (1208.HK) and Shanghai-listed Minmetals Development (600058.SS), is focusing its overseas expansion on Latin America and Africa to secure natural resources to supply a fast-growing Chinese economy.

In 2014, Minmetals was ranked No. 198 among the Fortune 500 companies, and No. 4 among metal companies. (see List of the largest companies of the People's Republic of China)

In 2009, China Minmetals had revenue of US$26.67 billion. The turnover and profits of China Minmetals reached US$21.8 billion and RMB 6.8 billion in 2007. Its resource reserves include 604 million tons of iron ore, 250 million tons of coke and 410,000 tons of tungsten. It can supply annually 11 million tons of rolled steel, 4.1 million tons of coal, 800,000 tons of coke, 145,000 tons of electrolytic copper, and 700,000 tons of alumina.

In the field of ferrous metal, China Minmetals remained the top steel trader of the nation and sped up the development of its upstream industrial chain. In the iron exploration in Anhui province, it has controlled 100 million tons of magnetite and 30 million tons of pyrite.

In the field of nonferrous metal, China Minmetals cooperated with Jiangxi Copper Corp to purchase 100% stake of Northern Peru Copper Corp (Canada), and set up joint venture with the U.S. Century Aluminum Corp in Jamaica to acquire the mining right for 150 million tons of bauxite. Its alumina project in Guangxi Province has annual output of 400,000 tons, which is the country's largest alumina project in both the scale and the investment.

In December 2021, Minmetals subsidiary, China Minmetals Rare Earth Co., confirmed that it would merge with a number of other rare-earth mineral producers to create the world's second-biggest producer. China Minmetals Rare Earth Co. will merge with Chinalco Rare Earth & Metals Co and China Southern Rare Earth Group Co into a new, unnamed, company. Jiangxi Ganzhou Rare Metal Exchange Co and Ganzhou Zhonglan Rare Earth New Material Technology Co will also be included in the transaction.

After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 China Minmetals Corporation continued to operate in Russia. It continues its operations in Russia despite the country's widely condemned invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions. Reports indicate that the Chinese government has been in discussions with state-owned enterprises, including China Minmetals, to explore potential investments in Russian energy and commodity companies. This approach has drawn criticism for indirectly supporting Russia's economy amid the ongoing war, which has resulted in significant civilian casualties and widespread devastation in Ukraine.
