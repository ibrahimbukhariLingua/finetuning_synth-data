## Career

Davis taught journalism at Olivet and founded the International Business Times in 2005 with Etienne Uzac, another Olivet associate. In 2013, Davis and Uzac, the co-founders of IBT Media, purchased *Newsweek*, forming Newsweek Media Group.

Following a fraud probe by the Manhattan district attorney in 2018 about the company's ties to Olivet University, Newsweek Media Group split. *Newsweek* became under the ownership of Davis and Pragad who each owned 50% of the company, and IBT Media under the ownership of Davis and Uzac.
