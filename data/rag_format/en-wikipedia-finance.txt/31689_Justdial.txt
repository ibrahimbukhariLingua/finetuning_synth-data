## History

In 1987, while working for a yellow pages company, V. S. S. Mani thought of replacing yellow pages with a database of information that users could call to receive current information about local business listings. To launch his venture, Mani acquired the Mumbai landline phone number 2888-8888. After several years of seeking financial backing for his idea, Mani launched Justdial in 1996 with a seed capital of ‚Çπ50,000, five employees, a few rented computers, and borrowed furniture.

In 2007, an Internet and mobile app version of the database called Justdial.com was launched.

On 20 May 2013, Justdial went public at a price between ‚Çπ897 and ‚Çπ898. Of the total 17.5 million shares, 13.5 million of them were offered to the public, while the rest were given to fifteen previous investors at ‚Çπ530 per share. To encourage retail investment, Justdial had promised that they would buy back shares from retail investors at the IPO price if Justdial's share price fell sharply within the first six months. By the close of the market on the day of the IPO, the majority of new investments had come from foreign institutional investors. On 5 August of the next year, Justdial's share price reached a high of ‚Çπ1,894.70, subsequently decreasing to the triple digitsêû•·µò·µÉ‚Åø·µó‚Å±·∂† ∏ in 2015. On 16 July 2021, Reliance Retail acquired a 66.95% stake in JustDial for ‚Çπ3,497 crores. As per the deal, Reliance Retail will hold 40.95 percent, and will make an open offer to acquire up to 26 percent in accordance with takeover regulations. The deal also mentioned that Justdial will allow Reliance access to the 25-year-old listings company's merchant database and Mani will continue to lead Justdial as managing director and chief executive officer.


## Products and services

Justdial's service is a database of business listings that users can either access by phone or online. The company also operates "Justdial Social", a service that aggregates content from social media websites, TV broadcast, news, and other sources; and "Search Plus Service", a service that manages online transactions via the web and mobile apps.


## Security flaws

On 10 October 2019, Indian-based independent security researcher Ehraz Ahmed detected a major security flaw in eleadmarket's Register API. The flaw allowed competent hackers to log into any eleadmarket account by simply placing the phone number in the username parameter. By doing so, this granted the hacker access to any person's Justdial account. This vulnerability puts the user's personal data at risk, but also compromises the user's social profile since the hacker could use the system ID generated by exploiting the flaw to access the JustDial Pay account, and post on the user's social profile. Justdial acknowledged that there was a bug in one of its API. There was no loss of any data or financial loss reported.


## Acquisition

Justdial was acquired By Reliance on July 20, 2021.
On July 20, 2021, RRVL acquired 1.31 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each of Just Dial for Rs 1,020 per equity share from VSS Mani, founder and chief executive of Just Dial, in a block deal.
