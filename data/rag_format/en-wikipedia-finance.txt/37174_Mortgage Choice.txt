## History

The company was founded in 1992 in Sydney by Rod Higgins and Peter Higgins. After two years in operation, the company became a franchisor in 1994 by selling its first franchise license in Wollongong. That grew to a national footprint in 1996.

In 1998 Mortgage Choice launched a website and ran its first TV advertisement one year later.

In 2004, the company officially listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.

In 2012, Mortgage Choice launched Mortgage Choice Financial Planning.

In 2016, Mortgage Choice expanded its product offering by launching a branded asset finance offering.

In 2018, Mortgage Choice announced the introduction of a new franchisee remuneration model that would give franchisees a bigger share of trail commissions, via a system in which franchisees can receive commissions based on either their new lending, or existing loans.

In 2021, Mortgage Choice was acquired by REA Group, amalgamating the lesser-known REA Group-owned Smartline broker franchise into the Mortgage Choice brand.
