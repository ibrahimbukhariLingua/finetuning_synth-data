Sihlcity


# Sihlcity



**Sihlcity** is a shopping mall located in Zürich which was built on the ground of a former paper mill near the Sihl river in the Wiedikon district and opened on 22 March 2007.

It comprises some 100,000 sq metres of rental space with a range of facilities, such as restaurants, a shopping center, a multiplex cinema, entertainment, health and fitness/wellness area, nightclub, a chapel, and formerly a Four Points hotel. The now-vacant Four Points is being replaced in the summer of 2024 by a new hotel, The Home Hotel, with a French restaurant and interiors and decor inspired by the Dada movement.
