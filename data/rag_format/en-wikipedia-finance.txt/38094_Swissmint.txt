# Swissmint



**Swissmint** is the official mint of the Swiss Confederation. Located in the Swiss capital city Bern, it is responsible for manufacturing Swiss franc coins, both of the currency and bullion variety. Apart from making coins for the government, Swissmint also manufactures medals and commemorative coins for private customers.


## Status

Swissmint is an agency of the Swiss federal government. It is part of the Federal Finance Administration, which in turn belongs to the Federal Department of Finance. Since 1998, the Official Mint of the Confederation operates as an independent business unit under the name *Swissmint*. As of 2005, Swissmint has 21 employees.


## Building

The mint's building is a heritage site of national significance. It was built in 1903–06 based on designs by Theodor Gohl to replace an older building at the *Gerberngraben*. The sober, industrial-style yellow brick building is fronted by a Neo-Renaissance façade in marble and sandstone.
