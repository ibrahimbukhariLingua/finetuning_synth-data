The Index was established on 27 December 2010 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, in collaboration with the Taqwaa Advisory and Shariah Investment Solutions (TASIS). They launched an Islamic index in a bid to attract more investors from India and overseas. On 19 February 2013, S&P Dow Jones Indices and the Bombay Stock Exchange ("BSE") announced their strategic partnership to calculate, disseminate, and license the widely followed *BSE* suite of indices. One of the first indices created by the partnership was the S&P BSE 500 SHARIAH. In line with other S&P BSE indices, on 16 August 2005 the calculation methodology was changed to the free-float methodology.
