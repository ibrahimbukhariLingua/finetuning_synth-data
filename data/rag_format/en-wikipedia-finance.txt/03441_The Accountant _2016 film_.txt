***The Accountant*** is a 2016 American action thriller film written by Bill Dubuque, directed by Gavin O'Connor, and starring Ben Affleck, Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Lithgow. The storyline follows Christian Wolff, an autistic certified public accountant who makes his living sanitizing fraudulent financial and accounting records of criminal and terrorist organizations around the world that are experiencing internal embezzlement.

*The Accountant* premiered in Los Angeles on October 10, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on October 14, 2016. Receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed $155 million worldwide. It received praise for Affleck's performance and the action sequences featuring pencak silat, an Indonesian martial art, but it was also criticized for its portrayal of autism.

A sequel to the film, with most of the cast and creative team returning and with Affleck and Matt Damon among the producers, is set to be released on April 25, 2025, by Amazon MGM Studios.


## Plot

A man who goes by the alias Christian Wolff is autistic. As a child, his mother wants to send him to Harbor Neuroscience, a treatment center, but his father disagrees. Unable to handle Christian's needs, his mother leaves the family. His military father begins training him and his brother Braxton in various martial arts while also encouraging Christian to acclimate himself to stimuli that trigger him rather than avoiding them.

As an adult, Christian acts as a forensic accountant for criminal organizations, "un-cooking" their financial records to uncover thefts. He operates a small accounting office in Plainfield, Illinois, that serves as a front for his money laundering enterprise. His criminal clients contact him via an unnamed woman, who also organizes his business. Christian is hired to audit the firm Living Robotics after the company's CEO, Lamar Blackburn, and his sister Rita learn of accounting irregularities. They assign in-house accountant Dana Cummings, who discovered the issue, to assist Christian.

Meanwhile, Treasury Director Ray King meets with data analyst Marybeth Medina, who has a criminal record as a juvenile but failed to disclose this on her employment application. He warns her she faces prison if he chooses to reveal the information and assigns her the task of finding Christian's real identity before King retires in a few months. Medina utilizes some information provided by King along with tax records to locate Christian's office.

Christian reviews fifteen years of the company's financial records in one night and finds that $61 million has been embezzled. He informs Rita of the total but admits he has not uncovered the thief's identity. That night, Living Robotics CFO Ed Chilton is forced by a hitman to overdose on his insulin. The next day, Lamar pays Christian the rest of the money for the audit although he has not finished and tells him to leave.

Christian kills two hitmen who have been sent to kill him, learning from one that Dana has also been targeted. He arrives at her apartment in time to stop another team from killing her, then takes her to his storage unit, which contains an Airstream recreational vehicle filled with artwork and valuables that he has accepted as payment. After hiding Dana at an expensive hotel, he goes to confront Rita but finds her murdered, causing him to suspect Lamar is the thief.

King, Medina and a group of agents search Christian's home. After everyone else leaves, King tells Medina what he knows of Christian and reveals that he began getting tips from him. He asks Medina to take over when he retires and to continue accepting Christian's information. She refuses, unable to justify taking tips from a murderer like Christian. The phone in the empty house rings, and Medina answers. Christian's partner gives her a tip about Living Robotics.

Christian goes to Lamar's mansion, where a team of hitmen await. He fights his way inside but is shocked to find his brother Braxton is the one protecting Lamar. The brothers fight and then reconcile, and when afterwards Lamar appears and tries to justify his actions, Christian kills him and, before leaving, makes arrangements to meet up with Braxton in a week's time.

Another set of parents visit Harbor Neuroscience. They meet Justine, the daughter of the clinic's director, who is revealed to be Christian's partner. Medina accepts her new role as Christian's contact and speaks at a press conference on the Treasury's investigation into Living Robotics.

Dana receives a framed copy of *Dogs Playing Poker* but discovers an original Jackson Pollock painting hidden underneath it. In the final scene, Christian is shown driving on a country road with his Airstream in tow.

## Reception


### Box office

*The Accountant* grossed $86.3 million in the United States and Canada and $68.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $155.2 million, against a production budget of $44 million.

*The Accountant* was released alongside *Max Steel* and *Kevin Hart: What Now?*, and was expected to gross $20–25 million from 3,332 theaters in its opening weekend, although the studio was projecting a conservative $15 million opening. The film made $1.35 million from its Thursday-night previews, more than Affleck's *Gone Girl* ($1.2 million) in 2014. It grossed $9.1 million on its first day and $24.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office and was the second-highest debut for a thriller of Affleck's career, behind *Gone Girl* ($37.5 million). In its second weekend, the film grossed $13.6 million (a drop of 44.8%), finishing fourth at the box office.


### Critical response

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 53% based on 285 reviews, with an average rating of 5.67/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "*The Accountant* writes off a committed performance from Ben Affleck, leaving viewers with a scattershot action thriller beset by an array of ill-advised deductions." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 84% overall positive score and a 64% "definite recommend".

Vince Mancini of *Uproxx* gave the film a positive review, writing, "It's transparent in its attempt both to pimp a future franchise and give autistic kids their own superhero. There's a genuine sweetness to the latter that converts me on the former. Headshots, math problems, and pained social interactions? Sign me up. Of the two movies Ben Affleck has been in so far this year, *The Accountant* and *Batman v Superman*, *The Accountant* has by far the most franchise potential." Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying: "Madness abounds in *The Accountant*, an intense, intricate, darkly amusing, and action-infused thriller that doesn't always add up, but who cares, it's BIG FUN."

Richard Brody of *The New Yorker* panned the film, stating: "This thrill-free thriller...piles up plotlines like an overbuilt house of cards that comes crashing down at the first well-earned guffaw of ridicule."

The film has also been called offensive to autistic people, in part because of its violence. Laurie Stephen, director of clinical services in Altadena, California, said "it's concerning that a movie features a character with autism who has guns and engages in this kind of aggression/violence".
