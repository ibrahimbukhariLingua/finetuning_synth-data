## History

The Royal Greenland Trading Department was founded in 1774 as a Dano-Norwegian state enterprise charged with administering the Danish settlements and trade in Greenland. The company's monopoly was finally ended in 1950 and the Home Rule Government, introduced in 1979, gained control in 1986, first renaming it "Kalaallit Niuerfiat" and then, in 1992, "KNI". The company's fishing operations were spun off as Royal Greenland A/S in 1990.
