In 1996 Yoshito Hori founded Globis Capital Partners (GCP) as a hands-on venture capital business inside Globis Corporation to support Japanese startup portfolio companies That same year an initial 540 million yen GLOBIS Incubation Fund was raised. Globis Corporation, Yoshito Hori as general partner, and Soichi Kariyazono as managing partner contributed a combined 40 million yen to the fund. The remaining amount was covered by institutional investors and other companies, including about $1 million invested by Sega Enterprises’ chairman Isao Okawa.

In 1999 Alan Patricof, the head of Apax Patricof selected Globis as a local partner in Japan to create Apax Globis Partners & Co. (AGP), a joint VC. The resulting Apax Globis Japan Fund raised $187 million.
