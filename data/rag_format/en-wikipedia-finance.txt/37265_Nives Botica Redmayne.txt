## Academic career

Botica Redmayne is a third-generation accountant and wanted to be an auditor since she was a child. However her first degree, from the University of Zagreb, was in economics and finance, leading her to describe her path into accountancy as "non-traditional". Botica Redmayne completed a PhD titled *The production of audit services in the New Zealand public sector: an investigation into the effects of political risk and corporate governance on audit effort* at Massey University in 2004. Botica Redmayne then joined the faculty, rising to full professor in 2024.

Botica Redmayne sits on the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Audit Oversight Committee, which develops standards for New Zealand accountants and auditors.

In 2021, Botica Redmayne was appointed as the first trans-Tasman president of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. She was also the first academic appointed to the role, which is normally reserved for practising accountants. During her term she focused on sustainability and education initiatives. Botica Redmayne previously served as the New Zealand Vice President of CAANZ in 2019 and 2020.

Botica Redmayne's research focuses on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) in public sector reporting. She examines how the introduction of these auditing and accounting standards affects the quality and cost of reporting and auditing, particularly with respect to the not-for-profit sector.
