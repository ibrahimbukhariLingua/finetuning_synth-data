## History


### Origins

The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) was established on 11 May 2008 in Shanghai.

### U.S. sanctions

In January 2021, the United States government named Comac as a company "owned or controlled" by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and thereby prohibited any American company or individual from investing in it. In January 2025, Comac was added to a United States Department of Defense list of companies that allegedly work with the PLA.


## Products

For all models beginning with the 919, Comac's naming system for commercial airliners has taken the form of 9X9.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In November 2024, Comac rebranded the ARJ21 as the C909 to match the format of the other models.

## Collaborations


### Bombardier

On 24 March 2011, Comac and the Canadian company Bombardier Inc. signed a framework agreement for a long-term strategic cooperation on commercial aircraft.

In May 2017, Bombardier and Comac began holding talks about an investment into Bombardier's passenger jet business.


### Boeing

On 23 September 2015, Boeing announced plans to build a Boeing 737 completion and finishing plant in China. The facility will be used to paint exteriors and install interiors into airframes built in the United States. The joint-venture plant will be located in Zhoushan, Zhejiang.


### Ryanair

In June 2011 Comac and Irish low-cost airline Ryanair signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of the C919, a 200-seat narrow-body commercial jet which will compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.


### UAC

**China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Co. Ltd.** (CRAIC), a joint venture company invested by Comac and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) responsible for the development of a wide-body commercial jet, was established in Shanghai on 22 May 2017. Research and development for the new plane was to be conducted in Moscow, with aircraft to be assembled in Shanghai. Subsequently the partnership was dropped, and by November 2023 Comac announced that it would develop the aircraft model (since rebranded C929) on its own.
