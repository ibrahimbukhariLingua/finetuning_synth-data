# Investing.com



**Investing.com** is a Israel-based financial markets platform and news website; one of the top three global financial websites in the world. It offers market quotes, information about stocks, futures, options, analysis, commodities, and an economic calendar. The company itself is registered in Cyprus, and has an Israeli subsidiary. The majority of employees and the CEO reside in Israel. After receiving tax incentives in Israel as a tech company, Investing.com moved its management to Israel and expanded its operations there.


## History

Founded by Israeli entrepreneur Dror Efrat in 2007 as Forexpros, the portal offered forex analysis, a broker directory, and a discussion forum in English, Spanish, Hebrew and Arabic. During 2008–2009, more editions were added, and the platform expanded its offering from Forex data to encompass other financial instruments.

The company purchased their current domain, Investing.com, for $2.45 million at the end of 2012 in one of the most expensive domain deals in history.

Investing.com's Android app was launched in September 2013, while an iOS version of the app was launched a year later. Over time, it added additional localized editions and services. Investing.com launched a new version of their cryptocurrency app in 2017.

In February 2021, it was ranked as the 194th most popular website in the world, according to Alexa. It has six offices worldwide and 300 employees (as of 2019), and is composed of 33 editions in 24 languages.

The company was acquired by Hong Kong–based Joffre Capital in 2021 for $500 million.

The company hires employees in Tel Aviv, Madrid, Milan, Tokyo, Mumbai, Seoul, Shenzhen, São Paulo, Mexico City, and across the United States, and maintains physical offices in Madrid, Tokyo, Seoul, São Paulo and Shenzhen.

Investing.com has launched a platform called InvestingPro which provides exclusive data, professional tools, custom charts and professional-grade. It is ad-free and can access up to 1000+ fundamental and technical metrics.
