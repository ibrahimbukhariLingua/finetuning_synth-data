Expo Real


# Expo Real



**Expo Real** (written EXPO REAL) is the biggest trade fair for real estate and investment in Europe. Since 1998 it has been organized by Messe München GmbH in the grounds of Messe München every year. Expo Real is Europe's biggest B2B trade fair.

In 2019, Expo Real covered an exhibition area of 72,250 square meters. There were 46,747 participants from 77 countries, including 24,682 representatives from 2,190 exhibiting companies.


## Concept

The exhibition zones of Expo Real reflect the complete supply chain of the real estate industry and extend from planning and project development to advisory activities and financing as well as implementation, operations and investment.

The fair offers an international networking platform to initiate business, present and initiate projects and make new contacts. The participants of Expo Real come from all over the world, but predominantly from Europe. At Expo Real 2019, representatives from new cities including Belfast, Porto and Copenhagen and countrywide representation from Malta and Lebanon attended for the first time.

The international conference program hosts about 400 speakers and provides an overview of the latest topics, trends and innovations in the industry as well as topical economic and political issues. In 2019, there was a series of panels ranging from Brexit, coworking, to the state of proptech, the future of urban planning and climate-friendly development. Another major topic was affordable housing, where measures ranging from rent caps to increasing the density of development in urban areas were discussed. Participants can obtain information in a separate exhibition area as well as from presentations and panel discussions of the supporting conference program.

Joint stands focusing on important asset classes have also been established: for the logistics properties the "LogRealCampus", for hotel properties the "World of Hospitality". In 2019, the new NOVA3 hall, dedicated to exploring how innovative proptech can benefit the sector, was introduced.

The "CareerDay" on the third day of the trade fair is particularly attractive for students. This is where young professionals and newcomers to the industry make contacts with company representatives and attend a specialized conference program.
