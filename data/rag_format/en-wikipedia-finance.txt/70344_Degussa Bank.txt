## History

In 1873 Degussa (*Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheide-Anstalt*) was founded. Even then, Degussa was entitled to "engage in banking activities related to the trading and processing of coins and unmounted precious metals". In 1936 it was recognized as a foreign exchange bank. In 1947 the house was approved as a foreign trade bank. In 1979, the Degussa Bank headquartered in Frankfurt am Main was spun out of Degussa AG as GmbH. The department in the group thus became a bank.

From 2002 until the end of 2006, the institute, as a subsidiary of ING-DiBa AG, belonged to the Dutch ING Group.

The Degussa Bank AG is the parent company of the Degussa Bank-Group and, for its part, is not majority-dominated. *ERSTE NEUE Christian Olearius Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH* and *Degussa Poolgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG*, both based in Hamburg, hold more than 25% of the bank.

In 2014, the bank changed its legal form from a limited liability company to a Corporation.

On April 30, 2024, the company was acquired by Oldenburgische Landesbank (OLB).
