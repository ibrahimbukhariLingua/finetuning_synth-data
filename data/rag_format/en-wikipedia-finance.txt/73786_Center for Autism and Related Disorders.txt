# Center for Autism and Related Disorders



The **Center for Autism and Related Disorders, Inc.** (**CARD**) is an organization that provides a range of services based on applied behavior analysis (ABA) for children and adults on the autism spectrum.

CARD was founded in 1990 by Doreen Granpeesheh. The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, acquired CARD in 2018. Granpeesheh and the management at CARD invested in the company alongside Blackstone, and Granpeesheh remained the CEO until December 2019, when she was replaced by Anthony Kilgore and moved into the role of executive director. In February 2022, Kilgore resigned for undisclosed reasons and was replaced by Jennifer Webster. On June 12, 2023, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The following month, an agreement was reached to sell the company back to a consortium headed by Granpeesheh for $48.5m.


## Documentary

CARD produced and distributed *Recovered: Journeys Through the Autism Spectrum and Back,* a 2008 documentary about four children that the organization claims completely "recovered" from the autism spectrum as a result of CARD treatment, despite the fact that there is no known cure for autism. The film was directed and edited by Michele Jaquis in collaboration with Granpeesheh and won the Best Documentary award at the 2008 Director's Chair Film Festival.
