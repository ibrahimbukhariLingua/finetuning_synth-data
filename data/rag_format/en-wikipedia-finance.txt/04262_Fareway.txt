## History

On May 12, 1938, Paul S. Beckwith opened the first Fareway store in Boone, Iowa located at 624 Story Street. Beckwith chose the name "Fareway" as he emphasized treating customers and employees fairly.

In December 2018, Fareway announced a new plan to help eligible full-time employees pay off their student loan debt. This benefit gives $100 a month with an upper limit of $5,000 total. This adds Fareway Stores, Inc. to the roughly four percent of companies across the nation that offer employee benefits concerning student loan debt.
