Renewable energy in Spain


# Renewable energy in Spain



**Renewable energy in Spain**, comprising bioenergy, wind, solar, and hydro sources, accounted for 15.0% of the Total Energy Supply (TES) in 2019. Oil was the largest contributor at 42.4% of the TES, followed by gas, which made up 25.4%.

Spain, along with other European Union (EU) States, has a target of generating 32% of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2030. A previous target of 20% for 2020, with an additional 0.8% available for other EU countries under the cooperation mechanism, was reached and slightly surpassed.

In 2021, renewables generated 46.7% of Spain's electricity needs, the largest part of it from wind power (23.3%), followed by hydroelectric (11.4%), solar (9.9%), and other renewables (2.2%). In 2023, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources rose to 50.8%, reflecting the country's progress towards its decarbonisation goals.


## Development

In 2019, the contribution of renewable energy sources to electricity generation was significant, comprising 101.1 Terawatt-hours (TWh) or 37.3% of the overall electricity production. The distribution of this contribution across different types of renewable energy was as follows: wind power led with 55.7 TWh, followed by hydroelectric power at 24.7 TWh, solar energy at 15.1 TWh, and bioenergy at 5.6 TWh. This is comparable to the International Energy Agency (IEA) median for 2019, which stood at 38% of electricity generation from renewables.

In the early 2000s, the growth of wind power contributed to an increase in Spain's renewable electricity production. By 2019, wind and solar energy made up 21% and 6% of total electricity generation, respectively. The installation of photovoltaic (PV) plants beginning in 2007 played a key role in this increase, doubling the renewables' share in Spain's electricity mix from 20% in 2008 to 40% in 2013. After this period of growth, the share of renewables in Spain's electricity generation leveled off, reaching 37% by 2019.

Spain's renewable energy sector has undergone significant shifts, initially driven by the 1997 Special Regime and Royal Decree 661/2007, which promoted considerable growth in wind and solar PV installations through favorable conditions and feed-in tariffs. However, the dynamics of the sector shifted following legislative reforms in 2012, marked by the enactment of Law 24/2013 and Royal Decree 413/2014. These reforms introduced a new financial framework for the electricity market, modifying compensation mechanisms for renewable sources, which led to a deceleration in new developments. Consequently, the rapid increase in renewable capacity, notably in wind energy, from 2.2 GW in 2000 to 23.0 GW in 2013, slowed, with only a slight rise to 23.4 GW by 2018. Solar PV installations experienced a similar trend.

In 2015 solar power suddenly demonstrated a possible way through the impasse. The continued fall in prices for solar systems and Spain's abundant sunshine led to prices for solar power reaching grid price parity. Suddenly there was the potential for sustained and spontaneous growth in solar installations in Spain as households and producers could produce power more economically. However, the Spanish government introduced what has been dubbed the world's first "sun tax" on solar installations making them economically less viable as well as draconian fines (up to 60 million Euros) for anyone not complying with the tax.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The tax has proved highly controversial. On the one hand, the government has argued that those generating their own power still rely on the national grid for power backup and so should be liable for contributing to the cost. On the other hand, the solar industry has argued that the government is simply trying to protect the centralised established power producers whose revenues would be threatened by this competitive solar threat. Environmentalists have criticised the tax for artificially blocking Spain from continuing its long standing movement to renewable energy production.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Whatever the merits of both arguments, the controversy can only become more heightened as the price of solar energy continues to fall and if PV solar power installed capacity in Spain were to continue sliding down the EU league from 12th position in 2014 (102.9 kW per 1000 inhabitants). In the same year in terms of wind energy production Spain was much stronger in 3rd position (495 kW per 1000 inhabitants).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In November 2018 the Government of Pedro Sánchez took the first step repealing the so-called 'sun tax', approved by the previous Government of Mariano Rajoy in 2015. With the new regulation, Spain leaves behind the era of punishment for self-consumption energy production which froze solar power and renewable energy development for many years in the face of EU and national controversy. A new chapter of opportunity is finally returning to the renewable energy sector in Spain.

Spain is advancing Europe's energy autonomy with Iberdrola's renewable energy projects, supported by a €1 billion loan from the European Investment Bank in a deal signed in June 2023. Iberdrola plans to build 19 solar photovoltaic power plants and three onshore wind farms in Spain, Portugal, and Germany, with a total capacity of nearly 2.2 gigawatts. These projects aim to generate 4 terawatt-hours of electricity, equal to the annual consumption of over 1 million households. Importantly, 70% of these installations will be in rural areas affected by the transition to net-zero emissions, fostering regional development. To ensure a stable power supply, Iberdrola will integrate hybrid battery systems into its photovoltaic projects. These plants are expected to be operational by the end of 2028, aligning with the European Commission's REPowerEU plan to reduce fossil fuel imports and accelerate the green transition.


## Energy consumption by sector

All EU countries as well as Iceland and Norway submitted National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) to outline the steps taken, and projected progress by each country between 2010 and 2020 to meet the Renewable Energy Directive. Each plan contains a detailed breakdown of each country's current renewable energy usage and plans for future developments. According to projections by the updated Spanish submission dated 20/12/11 by 2020 the gross final energy consumption in Spain by sector breaks down as follows.

| Projected energy use by sector in 2020 | ktoe | RE 2020 target | RE 2020 consumption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Heating and cooling | 30,929 | 17.3% | 18% |
| Electricity | 31,961 | 39.0% | 42.9% |
| Transport | 32.301 | 11.3% | 9.5% |
| Gross final energy consumption\* | 98.693 | 20.0% | 21.2% |

* *Including losses and adjustments*

According to NREAP criteria around a third of energy consumption (32.5%) is used in the heating and cooling sector. The heating and cooling sector (also known as the thermal sector) includes domestic heating and air conditioning, industrial processes such as furnaces and any use of heat generally. The electricity sector and transport sector are also projected to account for around a third of energy consumption each at 33.6% and 33.9% respectively. The proportion of energy use in each sector is similar to that of 2016. In order to meet Spain's overall target for 20% use of renewable energy (it was just 8.3% in 2005) in gross final energy consumption (20,505 ktoe) by 2020 targets have been set for each sector as follows: 17.3% renewable energy use in the heating and cooling sector, 39% in the electricity sector and 11.3% in the transport sector. Total annual energy consumption is projected to be 98,693 ktoe (98.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent) by 2020. The report expected Spain to produce a surplus of 0.8% above the 20% target (20.8% total) for renewable energy use which would be available for other countries to meet their renewable energy targets under the "cooperation mechanism".

The energy measures above are gross final energy consumption. Another broader measure, primary energy consumption also includes energy used in the extraction of fuels (the energy sector) and energy lost in transformation (the transformation sector, i.e. converting heat to electricity in power plants or fuel energy to heat in heating plants) as well as gross final energy consumption for end users. Under the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive EU countries submit their Energy Efficiency Plans every three years and Energy Efficiency Annual Reports every year. According to Spain's 2016 Energy Efficiency Annual Report the country's total final energy consumption in 2014 was 79.2 Mtoes whilst its primary energy consumption was 112.6 Mtoes. Most of the approximately 42% difference is accounted for in losses in the transformation sector. These losses are likely to be most prevalent in thermal electricity sectors, thus the use of renewable electricity will reduce CO₂ emissions and fuels lost in the energy and transformation sectors as well as those in final consumption. By using more efficient thermal generation the potential remains to reduce energy wastage by almost a third and to cut CO₂ emissions accordingly.


## Electricity Sector

In 2015, wind power provided the largest share at 19.1% followed by hydroelectric power at 11.1%. Solar power provided 5.2% and renewable thermal a further 2%. The total electricity supplied (demand coverage) from renewables was 37.4% of Spain's requirements in 2015. The current generational mix of electricity production can be checked in real time on the Red Electrica de Espana website.

Sharp variation from one year to the next is largely due to the substantial differences in hydroelectric production from one year to the next. Excluding hydroelectric production electricity generation from renewable energy sources grew from around 10 percent in 2006 to 26.3 percent of demand coverage in 2015. Most of the growth occurred in the years leading up to 2012 with little change in baseline capacity between 2012 and 2015. Renewable energy generated electricity had a record year in 2014 when it supplied 42.8% of Spain's national demand.

Total annual net generation from renewable sources has grown from around 60 TWh in 2007 to close to 100-110 TWh in the years 2013–2015. Wind power overtook hydroelectric power as the largest source of renewable electricity from around 2008 onwards to produce around 50 TWh from 2013 onwards. Hydroelectric power remains to second largest source typically generating between 25 and 45 TWh per year depending on whether the year is a wet or dry one. Solar PV power grew from just 484 GWh in 2007 to 8,202 GWh by 2012 and has remained at a similar level through to 2015. Solar thermal power grew from almost no presence at 8 GWh in 2007 to 5,085 GWh by 2015. Renewable thermal and other sources have grown from around 2,589 GWh in 2007 to 4,625 GWh in 2015. Total electricity generation from all sources has fallen in Spain from 288 TWh in 2007 to 267 TWh by 2015, a fall of around 7%.

Every two years all EU countries as well as Iceland and Norway submit Progress Reports outlining their renewable energy development and movement towards meeting their 2020 renewable energy targets. According to the Spanish progress reports between 2011 and 2014 renewable energy share in the heating and cooling sector grew from 13.6% to 15.8%. In 2014 biomass provided the largest share of RE in the heating and cooling sector at approximately 13.65% of the total, equating to 3.862 million tonnes of oil equivalent. RE from heat pumps provided a little over 1% of the total sector, solar and geothermal power provided a contribution of 0.92% and 0.07% respectively.


## Transport sector


Renewable energy in the transport sector, 2014
| Confirmed renewable sources | ktoe |
| --- | --- |
| Renewable electricity | 119 |
| Hydrogen | 0 |
| **Total (Confirmed)** | **119.7** |
| \*Unconfirmed renewable biofuels sources | ktoe |
| Biodiesels | 536 |
| Bioethanol | 186 |
| HVO (hydro treated vegetable oil) | 289 |
| **Total (Unconfirmed)** | **1,010** |

According to the third Spanish submission of EU country Progress Reports covering the years 2013 and 2014 renewable energy use in the transport sector in Spain and Brazil included renewable electricity accounting for energy use of 119.7 k toe. \*The bio fuels listed in the report and the table above had not been confirmed as coming from sustainable sources and were awaiting assessment and possible confirmation and as such are not yet able to be confirmed as renewable energy sources. They are included for information about the sector. The total energy from bio fuels were 1,010 k toe in 2014. Renewable electricity accounted for 0.5% of the total fuel use in the transport sector (using 2020 EU target criteria). A rough calculation would imply that if the bio fuels are finally confirmed as renewable sources then the total renewable energy use in the transport sector would come to approximately 4.7% of the total in 2014.
