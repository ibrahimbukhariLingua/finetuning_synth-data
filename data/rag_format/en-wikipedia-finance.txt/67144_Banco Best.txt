## History

The bank was founded in June 2001 with a shareholder structure consisting of the defunct Banco Espírito Santo (BES) 75% and Saxo Bank 25%. In 2015, with the departure of Saxo Bank, the bank became wholly owned by novobanco (100%).

In March 2023, novobanco launched the project to sell Banco Best, which it called "Project Bravo". However, two months after the sale process had been launched, Novo Banco withdrew from the sale of Banco Best due to the group's strategic repositioning in digital.
