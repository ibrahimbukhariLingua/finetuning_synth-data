## History

SIAC was created on July 17, 1972, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the NYSE and American Stock Exchange. The NYSE owned two thirds of SIAC, while the AMEX owned one third. SIAC initially provided processing services for both NYSE and AMEX's clearing corporations, and continued to do so when these merged into the National Securities Clearing Corporation. As of 2002, the three remained SIAC's main sources of revenue.

On November 1, 2006, NYSE Euronext purchased AMEX's stake for $40 million.
