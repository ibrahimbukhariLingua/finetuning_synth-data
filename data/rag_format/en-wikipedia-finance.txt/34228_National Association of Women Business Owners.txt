# National Association of Women Business Owners



The **National Association of Women Business Owners** (**NAWBO**) is an organization in the United States founded in 1975 that has the purpose of networking the approximately 10.6 million women-owned businesses so as to provide mutual support, share resources, and provide a single voice to help shape economic and public policy. As of 2025, the president of the organization is Jen Earle.


## History

According to its official timeline, NAWBO was founded in 1975 by a group of like-minded businesswomen in Washington D.C. area. It was incorporated as the Association of Women Business Owners (AWBO) before evolving to its current name.

In 1982, NAWBO held its first conference in Houston, Texas. Its first National Public Affairs Day saw the attendance of then-US Vice President George H. W. Bush and nine members of the U.S. Congress. Eight years later, it moved its headquarters from Chicago to Silver Spring, Maryland.

NAWBO has chapters in all 50 states, including several chapters in a single state, such as Illinois and California.
