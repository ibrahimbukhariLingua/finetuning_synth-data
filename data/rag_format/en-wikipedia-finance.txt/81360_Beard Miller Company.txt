Beard Miller Company


# Beard Miller Company



**Beard Miller Company** LLP (**bmc**), a legacy firm of ParenteBeard LLC, was an accounting and auditing firm serving clients mainly in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The firm was created through a series of mergers, the largest occurring in January 2001 between Beard & Company and Miller & Company. Prior to merging with Parente Randolph in October 2009, bmc had 16 offices located in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, and more than 600 employees. bmc was a member of the larger BDO Seidman Alliance, which enables Accounting and Consulting organizations other than the "Big 4 auditors" to share resources which may be otherwise unattainable. The CEO of bmc was Lamar Stoltzfus, who is now chairman of ParenteBeard.


## Branding

Though the firm’s legal name was Beard Miller Company, the firm elected to use its initials in lowercase (bmc) in day-to-day operations. The firm also used numbers in place of letters when advertising the brand’s image, a form of "rebus". For instance, the word “vision”, which appeared prominently in the company’s literature, is spelled out V1510N.


## Services

bmc provided the following services: Audit (including IT Audit and Employee Benefits), Tax Consulting and Form Preparation, and Business Consulting. The firm also had a sister organization, bmc Financial Advisors, which, while technically a separate entity, worked closely with the larger accounting organization.
