Medtrade


# Medtrade



**Medtrade** is an international trade conference in the field of medical supplies for the healthcare industry, which after a makeover in 2009 was to focus on advocacy, government affairs and continuing education. Medtrade hosts two events annually in the United States of America on varying dates.

Medtrade serves buyers and sellers of the home health care marketplace. The exposition (exhibit hall) product categories include mobility, respiratory, sleep, rehab products and aids to daily living. Other events within Medtrade include fundraising receptions from organizations for patient advocacy. Medtrade's average exhibit hall size in 2013 was 145,000 square feet, with 500 exhibitors and 7,000 attendees.

Beginning in 2023, the two annual Medtrade East (Atlanta, GA) and Medtrade West (Las Vegas, NV) conferences were consolidated into a single Medtrade conference held annually in Dallas, TX.


## Company history

Medtrade originally launched as the National Home Health Care Exposition, a part of the Nielsen Company. Onex Corporation acquired Nielsen Expositions on June 17, 2013, and changed the company name to Emerald Expositions; it owns and operates trade shows in the United States.
