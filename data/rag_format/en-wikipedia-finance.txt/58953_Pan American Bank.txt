The bank is a full service community bank offering deposit and loan services to the communities it serves. According to the FDIC, in CRA Evaluations released on January 1, 2013 and March 1, 2007, the bank has done an “outstanding” job of meeting the credit needs of its communities, a recognition received by less than 7% of the nation's banks in 2014. The evaluation by the FDIC was based on the bank's record of lending to small businesses and providing home mortgages and took into consideration the bank's record of lending in low and moderate income areas and loans to persons of low and moderate income.
