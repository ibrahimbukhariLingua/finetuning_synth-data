## Business lines


### Current business products

As of 2014ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, ARSAT had four business lines:

* **TDA** (Spanish: ***Televisión Digital Abierta***): A country wide digital terrestrial television SATVD-T broadcasting network. The Argentine government ordered a national terrestrial network, where all licensed broadcasting stations can get their programs transmitted through the common system. ARSAT is in charge of developing and installing the initial 90 broadcasting stations.
* **Argentine Geostationary Communication Satellite System** (**SSGAT** for Spanish: ***Sistema Satelital Geoestacionario Argentino de Telecomunicaciones***): The Argentine government has decided to fund a national satellite system where all ITU assigned geostationary orbital slots are filled with satellites designed and manufactured locally. It currently includes the ARSAT-1, ARSAT-2 and ARSAT-3.
 + **Conectar Igualdad** (Spanish for *Connecting Equality*): It's the national program for reducing the digital divide. ARSAT is in charge of the satellite segment of the program through the SSGAT.
 + **TDA**: ARSAT is also in charge of the satellite broadcasting segment of the national digital television broadcasting network.
* **Federal Fiber Optics Network** (**ReFeFO** for Spanish: ***Red Federal de Fibra Óptica***): The Argentine government has funded a 52,000 km (32,000 mi) fiber optic network to transport Internet, Digital Television, Telephony and private data. ARSAT is in charge of its construction and operation.
 + **Conectar Igualdad**: ARSAT is also in charge of leveraging the RFFO for this digital divide program.
 + **TDA**: ARSAT is also in charge of connecting the TDA terrestrial network through the RFFO.
* **Data Center**: In its ground station in Benavídez, Tigre Partido, Buenos Aires, ARSAT has built and operates a 4,200 m² (45,000 sq ft) TIER III certified data center.
* **CEATSA**: An environmental testing laboratory. While it is physically connected to INVAP's satellite manufacturing facility, ARSAT holds a majority ownership (80% as of 2015).

### Former business products

* ***Libre.ar*** (cancelled): In December 2012, gave ARSAT a mandate to set up a cellular network that would be open to small operators. This was possible because the Government had kept a set of frequency bands for a national network operator. The program never materialized and just 18 months later the frequencies were put up for auction.
