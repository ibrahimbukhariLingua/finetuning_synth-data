## Views

*He Is Not Dimon to You* was posted on the YouTube channel on 2 March 2017. The video received about 1.5 million views in its first day. A week after, this surged to 7 million, exceeding the result of *Chaika*, another film by Alexei Navalny and the Anti-Corruption Foundation. In two weeks, the video had received over 13 million views. A month after release, the video had over 17 million views. By May 2019, the video reached 30 million views.


## Reaction

Russian state-owned media and most of privately held media have completely ignored the controversial revelations. Initially there was no reaction from Dmitry Medvedev or other high-ranking Russian government officials.
On March 10, Medvedev blocked Alexei Navalny on Instagram. Navalny led country-wide street protests on March 26, with a stated goal of forcing Putin and Medvedev to respond to Navalny's accusations. Following the end of March protest action, Medvedev claimed that the movie was shot specifically as an excuse for it, while accusations of corruption were 'made up on compote principle from weird stuff, nonsense and some pieces of paper'.

According to Stephen Sestanovich, Navalny "has forced the president of Russia to stop pretending that he is against corruption. Others may rail against it, but for Putin, corruption is now officially 'fake news.'"

An April 2017 Levada poll found that 45% of surveyed Russians support the resignation of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, while 33% of respondents were against. *Newsweek* reported that "An opinion poll by the Moscow-based Levada Center indicated that 67 percent held Putin personally responsible for high-level corruption".


## Defamation suit

On 31 May 2017, Navalny lost a defamation suit over the documentary, filed by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov. A judge at Moscow's Lyublinsky district court ordered Navalny to remove his YouTube video and to publish a retraction, which Navalny stated he will not do.

In a trial which lasted two days, the judge dismissed nearly all of the motions that Navalny had filed, including summoning Medvedev to testify. She did not allow any witnesses to appear in front of the court or review the documents that the investigation was based on.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Navalny said that the verdict in Usmanov's favor should bring even more people to the streets at upcoming protests.
