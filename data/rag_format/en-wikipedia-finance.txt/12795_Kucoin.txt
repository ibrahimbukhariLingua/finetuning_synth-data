**Kucoin** is a Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange. It was founded in China in 2017, but was later moved to Singapore following the Chinese government's restrictions on cryptocurrency companies, and subsequently to the Seychelles.

Kucoin also operates its own crypto token known as Kucoin Shares (KCS).


## History

Kucoin was founded in 2017 by Chun Gan, Ke Tang, Michael Gan and Johnny Lyu. In November 2018, Kucoin raised $20 million in a series A funding round led by IDG Capital, Matrix Partners and Neo Global Capital.

KuGroup was formed in 2020 to manage the three business divisions in the company, including KuCoin Global, KuCloud and KuChain, and KCS Business Group. Michael Gan was appointed chairman of KuGroup, while Johnny Lyu was appointed CEO of KuCoin Global.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Kucoin raised $150 million in a series B funding round led by Jump Crypto in May 2022, giving it a valuation of $10 billion. In July 2022, Kucoin announced a $10 million investment from trading firm Susquehanna International Group (SIG). In September 2020, Kucoin announced it had suffered a major security breach that saw $281 million of crypto assets stolen. Kucoin CEO, Johnny Lyu disclosed in a statement that the hack occurred after private keys linked to crypto wallets got exposed. He added that the findings of the internal security audit report, revealed that part of Bitcoin, ERC-20, and other tokens in Kucoin's hot wallets were transferred out of the crypto exchange. Kucoin offered rewards of up to $100,000 to anyone who could provide valid information regarding the hack. North Korean hacker crew Lazarus Group was accused of carrying out the hack, which was dubbed the biggest cryptocurrency hack of 2020. In February 2021, Johnny Lyu wrote in a blog post that it had "cooperated with exchange and project partners to recover $222 million (78%), cooperated with law enforcement and security institutions to recover $17.45 million (6%) and insurance fund covered the remaining part, about $45.55 million (16%).

In December 2023, KuCoin reached a settlement with the New York State Attorney General. Under the settlement, the company agreed to pay $22 million in fines and refunds and to discontinue its trading operations in New York. The settlement addressed allegations that KuCoin operated without proper registration as a securities and commodities broker-dealer and misrepresented its status as a cryptocurrency exchange.

In March 2024, KuCoin and its co-founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, were indicted on charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and failing to implement required anti-money laundering protocols.

In January 2025, KuCoin admitted to charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and agreed to pay nearly $300 million in fines and forfeitures, resolving the criminal proceedings.
