Smith helped Jeff Horing and Jerry Murdock launch Insight Partners in 1995, and led the firms' investment into Quest Software. He joined Quest as its CEO in 1998 and took the company public the following year. Quest was acquired by Dell in 2012. At the time, Quest had over 4,000 global employees and approximately $1 billion in annual revenue.

Smith founded Toba Capital in 2013. Toba Capital is an investment firm with over $3.5 billion in assets under management, principally funded by Smith's family office.

## Philanthropy

Smith has pledged 50% of Toba Capital’s returns to foundations that make sustainability-related investments and charitable donations. The balance of returns will be reinvested into companies with the potential to produce meaningful quantities of high-quality jobs and shift markets for the common good.

Smith’s primary charitable foundations are Teach a Man to Fish and Walking Softer. Walking Softer was founded to promote, celebrate and in a small way resource the invention of a new economy built on circularity, conservation, and renewal, where the long-term health of the Earth and its inhabitants is considered as deeply and thoughtfully as profit.
