**Paymentwall Inc.** is a payment service provider which services businesses in the SaaS, travel, and e-commerce industries.


## History

Honor Gunday and Vladimir Kovalyov started Paymentwall in April 2010 to help game companies on Facebook monetize their global traffic.

In 2011, the company entered into partnership with Alipay, a third-party mobile and online payment platform, established in Hangzhou, China in February 2004 by the Alibaba Group.

Paymentwall launched a payment system for Smart TVs in November 2014.

In 2018, Paymentwall spun out Terminal3 as a global payment platform for gaming companies.
