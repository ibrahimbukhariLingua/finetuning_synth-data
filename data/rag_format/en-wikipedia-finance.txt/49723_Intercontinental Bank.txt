In 2005, Intercontinental successfully merged with three other commercial banks, in which it held equity positions prior to the merger, namely Equity Bank of Nigeria, Gateway Bank and Global Bank.

In 2009, after a special audit of the commercial banks in Nigeria by the Central Bank of Nigeria, the country's banking regulator, found nine of the banks to be under-capitalized and badly managed. Intercontinental Bank Plc. was one of the troubled banks. Following the injection of capital by the Federal Government of Nigeria, to maintain solvency, the troubled banks embarked on re-capitalization through participation by new investors.

In 2011, Access Bank began talks with the Central Bank of Nigeria to acquire Intercontinental Bank. Further to the approval of the shareholders of Intercontinental bank and Access Bank, court sanction of the Federal High Court of Nigeria and approval of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Securities & Exchange Commission, Access Bank plc completed recapitalization of Intercontinental Bank and the acquisition of 75% majority interest in Intercontinental Bank. In effect, Intercontinental Bank (including all its assets, liabilities and undertakings) became a subsidiary of Access Bank plc.
