# General Confederation of Italian Industry



The **General Confederation of Italian Industry** (Italian: *Confederazione Generale dell'Industria Italiana*), commonly known as **Confindustria**, is the Italian small, medium, and big enterprises federation, acting as a private and autonomous chamber of commerce, founded in 1910. The association network is made of 222 associations, bringing together more than 150,000 companies of all sizes on a voluntary basis, accounting for around 5,400,000 individuals. It aims to help Italy's economic growth, assisting, in doing so, its members. It is a member of the International Organisation of Employers (IOE). The President is Emanuele Orsini since 23 May 2024.

Confindustria was a founding member of several organizations, including ISTUD (Istituto Studi Direzionali) and Assingegneria (an organization set up by Confindustria, which has since merged with OICE, L'ingegneria italiana organizzata - which in itself belongs to Confindustria).

Members of Confindustria include ANIMA, the Federation of the Italian Associations of Mechanical and Engineering Industries.

It owns the prominent newspaper *Il Sole 24 Ore*. With local chapters all over Italy, it is popularly synonymous with Italian business.
