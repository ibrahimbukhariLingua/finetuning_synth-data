# Mercialys



**Mercialys** is a French company that operates in real estate, owning and managing properties. It was created by the retailer company Casino Group in 2005.


## History

In the late 1990s, the food retailer company Casino Group delegated the management of their retailer properties in a new subsidiary, Groupe Casino Immobilière. In 2005, it was turned into a company with independent operations, which would go public itself, called Mercialys, although Groupe Casino retained a majority stake and therefore its control. Mercialys was listed on the Paris Bourse on November 1, 2005. The new company opted for the SIIC legal tax status for real estate investment trusts.


## Activities

Mercialys leases its properties (mostly shopping malls, self-service restaurants and other vendor locations) to retailer companies so that these exploit it. The fact Mercialys maintains retail property assets in the long run, renovating and renting them, with limited exposure to development activities, gives it an advantage and a lower risk for investors. It manages more than 120 properties, with a gross leasable area of about 714,500 m². The Mercialys' subsidiaries include Mercialys Gestion, Timur SCI, Point Confort and La Diane, among others.

On March 4, 2012, Mercialys issued a bond to seven years, raising 650 million. Also, it took debt from five banks to finance a 1.25 billion euros exceptional distribution for shareholders. It was supposed that these operations were carried out to fund Casino Group projects in Brazil.
