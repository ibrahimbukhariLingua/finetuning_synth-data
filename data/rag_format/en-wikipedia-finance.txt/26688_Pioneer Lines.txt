Pioneer Lines


# Pioneer Lines



**Pioneer Lines** (formerly **Pioneer Railcorp**) was a holding company for a number of American short-line railroads. Other subsidiaries offered locomotive and freight car leasing to its own railroads and to third parties, and also freight car cleaning. Pioneer Lines also had interests in real estate and newsletter publishing. It was previously owned by BRX Transportation Holdings starting in 2019.

The company, originally named Pioneer Railroad Company, was founded on January 30, 1986 by Guy L. Brenkman. The company raised the capital for its first acquisition through a self-underwritten public stock offering. It continued this method of raising capital for subsequent acquisitions.

Almost all of the short lines owned by Pioneer are lines spun off by Class I railroads.

On August 8, 2022 Patriot Rail Company announced its intention to acquire Pioneer Lines. The company was acquired by Patriot Rail on September 14, 2022.
