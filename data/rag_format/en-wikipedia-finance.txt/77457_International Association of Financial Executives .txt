International Association of Financial Executives Institutes


# International Association of Financial Executives Institutes



The **International Association of Financial Executives Institutes** (**IAFEI**) is the premier global society of financial executives. Founded in 1969, it connects financial executives around the world with a global membership of more than 15,000 senior level finance executives, mainly chief financial officers across 18 national institutes. It is an international, non-profit and non-political professional association domiciled in Switzerland with its secretariat in the Philippines (Makati).


## Aims

IAFEI promotes networking opportunities for member institutes and their individual members, to build a wider understanding of financial practices throughout the world and the furtherance of their international compatibility and evolution, and the promotion of ethical considerations and best practices of financial management throughout the world.

IAFEI works to advance the finance profession through the activities of its technical working committees, through hosting and partnering with global, regional and national conferences, and through a number of expert publications including the *IAFEI Quarterly*, a digital journal of record.

The IAFEI World Congress is held annually since 1969. The congresses rotate among continents each year and are organized by the responsible national member institute on behalf of IAFEI. The 43rd IAFEI World Congress was held in conjunction with the 6th CFO Summit Emerging Europe & CIS in October 2013 in Warsaw. The 44th IAFEI World Congress was to be held in October 2014 in Manila, hosted by the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX).

## History

The First International Congress of Financial Executives took place 1969 in Marbella, Spain and was hosted by the Spanish institute for finance executives (AEEF). At this event a new head organization for national institutes was created, with a legal situs in Switzerland. At the second world congress (Brussels in 1970), 55 representatives of 15 member institutes finalized the creation of the association. IAFEI was founded by the financial executives institutes of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Spain, United Kingdom and the combined institutes of the United States of America and Canada (today: FEI - Financial Executives International), which played a key role.


## IAFEI World Congress

The IAFEI World Congress is an annual congress organized on behalf of the IAFEI. The two to four day congress, which includes a gala dinner, is hosted by one of IAFEI's national member institutes. The congress, which is organized for corporate finance executives from all over the world, is normally held with the national convention of the hosting institute.

The first congress of international finance executives institutes was held in 1969 in Marbella, Spain. IAFEI World Congresses have since been held in 21 different countries. In the years 1975 and 2009, no congresses were organized.
