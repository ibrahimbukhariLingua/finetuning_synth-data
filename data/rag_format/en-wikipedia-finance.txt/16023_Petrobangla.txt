## History

Petrobangla was founded in 1985 (Notification of Ordinance-21 in April 11 1985) by merging two government organizations Bangladesh Oil & Gas Corporation (BOGC) and Bangladesh Mineral Exploration and Development Corporation (BMEDC) into Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation(BOGMC). To import liquefied natural gas, Petrobangla signed an agreement with Gunvor Singapore in 2018. In September 2019, QatarEnergy LNG delivered the first cargo of liquefied natural gas from a Q-Flex vessel to Petrobangla's Floating Storage and Regasification Unit off Bangladesh. In January 2020, PetroBangla and Gazprom signed a Memorandum of Understanding for strategic cooperation.

The group's current Chairman, Nazmul Ahsan, was appointed in December 2021 replacing Abdul Fattah who had become chairman in January 2020.
