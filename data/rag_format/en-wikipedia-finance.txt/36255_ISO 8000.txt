ISO 8000


# ISO 8000



**ISO 8000** is the international standard for *Data Quality and Enterprise Master Data*. Widely adopted internationally it describes the features and defines the requirements for standard exchange of Master Data among business partners. It establishes the concept of Portability as a requirement for Enterprise Master Data, and the concept that true Enterprise Master Data is unique to each organization.

Master Data is used to manage critical business information, most commonly in the context of a digital supply chain although also used across public services e.g. health, about products, services and materials, constituents, clients and counterparties, and for certain immutable transactional and operational records.

Application of this standard has already proven it can significantly reduce procurement costs, promote inventory rationalization, and deliver greater efficiency and cost savings in supply chain management.

The ISO 8000 standard was first proposed in 2002, and the first components were approved in 2009. Part 115, which describes "Quality Identifier Prefixes" for "Quality Identifiers," was approved in 2017. Part 116, which describes the "exchange of quality identifiers and the application of ISO 8000-115 to authoritative legal entity identifiers", was approved in 2019 (see the Key Concepts, below). Many successful organizations have already adopted Master Data, and its precursor, Reference Data, and the core elements of the maturing standard are quickly being adopted by many Fortune 500 corporations. Around the world, Government agencies in major economies involved in the supervision and regulation of financial and commodities markets, telecommunications, media, high technology and military have adopted a wide range of ISO 8000 Master Data strategies, and several are establishing audits and controls based upon ISO 8000.

ISO 8000 is one of the emerging technology standards that large and complex organizations are turning to in order to improve business processes and control operational costs.

ISO 8000 is being developed by ISO technical committee TC 184, Automation systems and integration, sub-committee SC 4, Industrial data. Like other ISO and IEC standards, ISO 8000 is copyrighted and is not freely available.

Parts 1, 2 and 8 are ISO horizontal deliverables, identifying them as applicable to all sectors.
