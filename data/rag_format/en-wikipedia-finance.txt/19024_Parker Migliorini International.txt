Parker Migliorini International


# Parker Migliorini International



**Parker Migliorini International (PMI Foods)** is a multinational food brokerage company founded in 2009 through the merger of Parker International and Meridonial Meat Import & Export Ltd. The company is currently headed by Darin Parker and distributes a variety of food products across six continents.


## History

Parker International was founded in 1992 in Salt Lake City, Utah. It established as a joint venture with Meridional Meat Import & Export Ltd, a company formed in 1995 in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

Parker International merged with the Migliorini family's enterprise to form Parker Migliorini International (PMI Foods). The merged entity became a global enterprise with an annual trade volume exceeding 1.6 billion pounds (approximately 725.7 million kilograms) of beef, pork, chicken, seafood, and eggs, generating around US$3 billion in revenues. It sources protein from multiple regions, including North America, Australia, and Uruguay, to meet China’s regulatory requirements.

As of 2025, PMI Foods operates in more than 60 countries, and employs over 800 staff worldwide.


## Business Model

PMI Foods specializes in the sourcing and distribution of food products, including meat, dairy, seafood, fruits, and vegetables. The company employs stringent quality control across its supply chain and offers logistics solutions to ensure timely delivery. PMI Foods operates through three main business platforms: Global Solutions, Distribution, and Food Service.


## Operations


### China

PMI exports high-protein foods to China. According to data from Panjiva, PMI Foods is involved in beef trade between Brazil and China and shipped more than US$1.7 billion in Brazilian beef over the past decade.

The company’s entry into that market occurred indirectly through sales of beef products to Hong Kong, which at the time served as a standard entry point into mainland China. Darin Parker, the company's founder, began working in Asian markets around 25 years ago, initially focusing on food distribution in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Parker noted that the early markets evolved at different speeds, with Japan developing slowly and presenting significant challenges for foreign businesses, while China’s market progressed more rapidly, allowing the application of strategies learned elsewhere.

Due to limited attention in Hong Kong, the company shifted operations directly to Guangzhou in southern China. Over time, China became a primary market, accounting for approximately 60 percent of the company’s global sales.
PMI Foods has established a significant presence in the Chinese market.

Market access has varied over time. After detecting Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), Chinese authorities banned U.S. beef imports, prompting the company to adapt its sourcing. This ban was eventually lifted, and China subsequently allowed a wider range of U.S. chicken products. In 2018, at the height of the US/China trade war, PMI Foods ceased importing US cuts of meat into China as tariffs imposed by Beijing drove prices up.

The company utilizes advanced cold chain logistics and implements market diversification strategies to navigate complex regulatory environments and adapt to local consumer preferences. Operating as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) in China, PMI Foods leverages trade agreements and governmental frameworks to optimize its market presence, with approximately 60% of its global sales generated through Chinese distribution channels.


## Philanthropy and community involvement

The company has actively worked with charitable nonprofits—such as New Life Church, Los Angeles Mission, and CityServe—on food donation initiatives for those in need.

In December 2022, PMI Foods began work with the nonprofit One Tree Planted to plant 10,000 trees in the Amazon region, followed by an additional commitment of 10,000 trees in February 2024 as part of a larger goal to plant one million trees.

Between May and August 2023, the company made multiple donations in Los Angeles, including 99 cases of meat to the Los Angeles Mission and 10,500 pounds of beef bone-in rib ends to various food banks. Of the latter, 9,625 pounds were allocated to the Los Angeles Mission, while 875 pounds were distributed through the Farmlink Project. In November 2023, PMI Foods partnered with Paula White Ministries and StoryLife Church to provide turkeys and full Thanksgiving meals to needy families, the elderly, and children attending Title One schools. In December 2023, PMI Foods worked with the First Assembly of God in Huntington Park to supply more than 1,000 pounds of beef during the holiday season.

In March 2024, PMI Foods collaborated with New Life Church in Arkansas to assist underserved communities, leveraging the church’s network of 18 campuses to distribute meals. That same month, the company partnered with City of Refuge in Atlanta, donating 10,000 pounds of prime rib to feed individuals affected by human trafficking, homelessness, and food insecurity, having previously donated 11,000 pounds of ribs to the same organization.

In July 2024, PMI Foods, CityServe, and Decision Tactical organized a Fourth of July event at Glad Tidings Church in Ocoee, Florida, providing 5,000 pounds of pork ribs and other activities to honor veterans and their families.

During the Russo-Ukrainian War, PMI Foods worked with CityServe International to support Ukrainian refugees, delivering 32,400 cans of shelf-stable food to a CityServe warehouse as part of broader relief efforts.


## Controversies

In 2012, PMI Foods was accused by the FBI of illegally exporting meat to China and Japan. Two years later, a company related to PMI Foods pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of lying to the government about its meat exportations and paid a $1 billion fine.

An investigation conducted by the Associated Press and the Rainforest Investigation Network in 2023 reported that PMI Foods imported $1.7 billion worth of Brazilian beef to China and other countries in the preceding ten years. The investigation stated that the imported beef was supplied by JBS S.A., a Brazilian meat processing company that Brazilian prosecutors have repeatedly accused of buying cattle raised in deforested land.
