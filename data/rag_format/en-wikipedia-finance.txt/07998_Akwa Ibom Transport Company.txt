# Akwa Ibom Transport Company



The **Akwa Ibom Transport Company** (**AKTC**) is a state-owned transportation company headquartered in Uyo, Nigeria. Established in 1988, the company was founded shortly after the creation of Akwa Ibom State in 1987 to facilitate the conveyance of civil servants within the state. AKTC has expanded its operations to include inter-state transport services. The company operates a fleet of buses, providing transportation for passengers and cargo across various routes. AKTC faces challenges such as high operational costs and infrastructure issues.


## History

Established in 1988, the Akwa Ibom Transport Company (AKTC) was created shortly after the formation of Akwa Ibom State in 1987. The increase in the number of civil servants living outside central Uyo and its surrounding areas necessitated a reliable means of transportation for their daily commute. Consequently, the government decided to provide transport services for these civil servants. Initially, the company utilized buses inherited from the former Cross River State after Akwa Ibom State was established. The primary objective of AKTC was to provide transportation services to the public.

To improve its operations, AKTC was leased to private operators in 2005. The first lease agreement lasted 16 years, followed by a second lease currently in effect for 25 years. Despite these efforts, the company continues to face challenges such as service quality, high transportation fares, poor infrastructure, a limited fleet of vehicles, insufficient drivers, and inadequate driver training.


## Management and structure

The Akwa Ibom Transport Company Limited operates as an autonomous parastatal under the State Ministry of Works and Transport. It is headed by a General Manager/Chief Executive appointed by and reporting directly to the State Governor. The company employs 2,335 workers across various categories, with an average of five workers per bus.

The organizational structure of AKTC comprises departments such as Internal Audit, Monitoring, Planning, Research, Training/Terminal/Maintenance, Store, and Revenue. These departments manage the company's human transport resources. The company faces challenges related to technical expertise and staffing quality, which management is addressing through training programs.


## Operations

AKTC operates a fleet of 83 vehicles, with 70 in functional condition and 13 currently unserviceable. The fleet consists of various models, including Peugeot mini buses, Fiat Bureau Buses, and Mercedes models such as MB0365, M/B 608D, and M/B 911 Mobile Workshop. The company manages 21 routes, including nine inter-state routes connecting cities such as Abuja, Kaduna, Lagos, Yola, Kano, Jos, Port Harcourt, Calabar, and Aba.

Since its inception, AKTC has provided commercial bus services and increased the number of vehicles available for public transport within the state. The company has transported over 7.3 million passengers and helped stabilize transport fares. Additionally, AKTC has encouraged private operators to adopt a consumer-oriented approach, thereby aiming to improve the overall transport environment in the state.


## Challenges and prospects

AKTC faces several challenges, including high costs associated with procuring new vehicles and spare parts, inadequate workshop efficiency, and maintenance culture. The excessive demand for vehicles and persistent overloading contribute to vehicle depreciation and a shorter lifespan.

Despite these challenges, AKTC has provided commercial buses for public transport, facilitated the movement of goods and people, and offered affordable fares, stabilising transport costs. Additionally, the company organises periodic training programs for drivers focusing on road safety and accident prevention.
