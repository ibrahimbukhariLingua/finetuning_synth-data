# Diamond Castle



**Diamond Castle Holdings** is a private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout and growth capital investments in middle-market companies across a range of industries including the media, healthcare, financial services, power and industrial sectors.

The firm, which is based in New York City, was founded in 2004. The firm has raised approximately $1.9 billion since inception.


## History

In 2004, DLJMB co-head Larry Schloss, along with four senior members of DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, led a spinout from Credit Suisse to form a new private equity firm which would come to be known as Diamond Castle Holdings.


## Funds

In December 2006, the firm announced it had completed fundraising for a $1.85 billion private equity fund, known as Diamond Castle Partners IV (a reference to the three DLJMB funds previously raised).

As of 2014, the firm had not sought to raise a successor fund.
