## History

Martin Williams was founded in 1947 by Royce Martin and Larry Williams. The pair had recently left McKenzie, another Minneapolis advertising agency, bringing the Creamette Company with them as their first client. At the time, Creamette was owned by Williams’ family.

In its early years, Martin Williams focused on account service and media capabilities, while shopping creative work out to freelancers. In 1960, Larry Williams sold his shares in the agency to Royce Martin and left to become the Vice President at Creamette. In 1964, Don Hagg joined Martin Williams as creative director, and, in 1966, Hagg and Steve Martin (Royce's son) took over the agency.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
