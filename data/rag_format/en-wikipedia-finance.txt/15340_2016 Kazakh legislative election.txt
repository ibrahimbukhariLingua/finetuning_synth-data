Legislative elections were held in Kazakhstan on 20 March 2016. The date was set by president Nursultan Nazarbayev on 20 January 2016, when he dissolved the Mäjilis after it had requested dissolution on 13 January, with the reason cited being the economic crisis caused by low oil prices. The term of the Mäjilis would have expired in the fall of 2016.

The result was an expected victory for Nur Otan from the exit polls which won an extra seat while the Ak Zhol Democratic Party and Communist People's Party of Kazakhstan maintained their presence in the Mäjilis. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) complained about lack of "genuine political choice" and "pluralism of opinion in the media."


## Background

From 2014, Kazakhstan had experienced economic crisis as a result of oil price crash in which it is heavily reliant on for revenue and the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge that was caused by the country's neighboring and main trading partner of Russia which faced a financial crisis as a result of international sanctions over the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and War in Donbass.

In the 2015 Kazakh presidential election, President Nursultan Nazarbayev won 97.7% of the vote with lack of any opposition candidates. From there, he announced that the Nurly Zhol economic stimulus would remain as top priority in dealing with the economic troubles and that the sanctions against Russia can't be stay forever, believing that the conflict in Ukraine would eventually end in peace. Despite the promises, the price of oil continued dropping and Kazakhstan's exports shrank by 40%. In August 2015, the tenge lost 5% of its value against dollar. Chairman of the National Bank of Kazakhstan Kairat Kelimbetov dismissed the claims of currency devaluation saying that "this is a transition to a freely floating rate when the market itself determines a balanced exchange rate on the basis of supply and demand." The inflation rate though did drop by 3.7% from the beginning of the year because of low oil prices and weak domestic demand. By October 2015, the tenge devalued by 40% and the inflation rate eventually rose again by 13% at the end of the year.

On 13 January 2016 members of the Mäjilis voted unanimously to request Nazarbayev dissolve parliament. The reason was Nazarbayev's warning about a potential upcoming "real crisis" that would be caused by low oil prices. One week later, Nazarbayev set 20 March 2016 as the date for the snap elections, which would be held concurrently with elections to mäslihats (local legislative bodies).


## Electoral system

The 98 directly elected members of the Mäjilis were elected from a single nationwide constituency by proportional representation with a 7% electoral threshold. Seats were allocated using the largest remainder method. If parties had an equal largest remainder, the party that was registered first was awarded the seat. If only one party crossed the threshold, the party with the second highest number of votes was to be awarded at least two seats. A further nine seats were elected by the Assembly of People, a body selected by the President.

Although he expressed doubts about running for seat in the Mäjilis, Tuyakbay noted that with him, the party list would count as 28 candidates. The JSDP adopted an anti-crisis platform titled "Get your voice back, get your country back!" which called to an end in the decline in the living standards of citizens, stopping the collapse of the tenge, transformation of an authoritarian regime to a democratic form of government, and an ensuring of the environmental safety by proposing a ban on the import and disposal of foreign nuclear and other hazardous waste on the territory of Kazakhstan.
