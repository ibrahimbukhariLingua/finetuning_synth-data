Golden Star Bank


# Golden Star Bank



The **Golden Star Bank** was North Korea (DPRK)'s last bank in Europe.


## History

It was established in 1982, located in Vienna, Austria, and owned by Taesong Bank. In 2003, the Austrian Interior Ministry released a report that claimed that the bank was engaging in espionage, "money-laundering, the distribution of forged currency and illegal trade with radioactive substances." The bank was closed in June 2004 amid suspicions of money laundering and the funding of North Korean arms, although there was not enough evidence to start a criminal trial.
