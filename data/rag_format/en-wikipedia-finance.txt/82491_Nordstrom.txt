# Nordstrom



**Nordstrom, Inc.** (/ˈnɔːrdstrəm/) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores. Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023).


## Early history

John W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden. In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16. His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjuːhɑn ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈnuːr(d)strœm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m²) potato farm in Arlington, Washington. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000. Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.


## Operations during 20th century


### Wallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best

Nordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.

By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.


### Following renaming to Nordstrom

In 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange. It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.

Their business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field. With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978. By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.

In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued. The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995. In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.

The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida.

Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers.

In 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State. It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997, and Manhattan in 2019.

Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997. In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016. At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m²), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m²). This location has since closed.

In 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.


## Operations during 21st century


### 2000–2009

In 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold. Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.

Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.


### 2010–2019

In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year "earn-out" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance. On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, "We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing."

In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.

Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014. In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.

On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market. Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009. The location eventually opened in September 2015.

Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico. After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018. On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently.

In May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019. Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.

Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014. In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware. The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.

In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.

In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii. In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.

On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels. President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. *Fortune* declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving "tweet curse".

In October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first "Nordstrom Local" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private. In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package. Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.

On January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.

In fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.


### 2020–present

On March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.

On March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.

In late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.

In October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.

On December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced their plans to take the company private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The plan involves selling 49.9% percent of the company to Mexican department store and real estate company El Puerto de Liverpool, with the remaining 50.1% controlling stake being held by the Nordstrom family. On the deal, CEO Erik Nordstrom stated that “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.”


## Nordstrom Canada

**Nordstrom Canada Retail, Inc.** (French: *Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.*) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.

Four full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term. Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction. Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014. It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015; the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015; and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017. The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013, and opened on October 21, 2016. The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014, however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.

The first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018. Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons.

On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, "Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business." The closing would be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian *Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act* (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator. Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023, while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023.

## Patent infringement

On April 19 2024, Taylor Swift uploaded a YouTube Shorts video to promote her new album where she's seen wearing a skort designed by Cassey Ho, CEO and lead designer at her own company, Popflex. Cassey told Business Insider that she was in a hair salon when she knew about it . For this skort, named "Pirouette Skort", Cassey obtained a design patent in the US .

In February 17 2025, Cassey Ho posted on her social media that she found out Nordstrom was selling her patented skort without her authorization, under the brand Gottex. She then contacted Nordstrom to warn about patent infringement. As she tells on her post, instead of complying, the law firm CM Law, representing Gottex, responded with a threat of prosecution if Cassey continued to declare her design was stolen by Nordstrom, which she considered a form of intimidation and harassment by the brand.
