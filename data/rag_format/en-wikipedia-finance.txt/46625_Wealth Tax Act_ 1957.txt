The Wealth Tax Act, 1957 governed the taxation process associated with the net wealth that an individual, a Hindu Undivided Family, or a company possesses on the valuation date.

The valuation date was an important component in the calculation of the Wealth Tax. The net wealth that an assessee possessed on the valuation date determined the amount of tax. The valuation date was the day of 31 March immediately preceding the Assessment Year.

Wealth tax was calculated at the rate of 0.25 percent (1.0 percent w.e.f April 2010) of the amount of net wealth that exceeds Rs. 50 lakh(Rs. 30 Lakh w.e.f April 2010) on the valuation date. The net wealth of an assessee included the value of specified unproductive assets on the valuation date after subtracting the debt the assessee owes on the said assets.
