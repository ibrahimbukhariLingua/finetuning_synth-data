## Comptroller of the Currency

Brooks joined the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in April 2020 as Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Brooks oversaw the agency's bank supervision, bank supervision policy, economics, supervisory system and analytical support, systemic risk identification support and specialty supervision, and innovation functions. He served as a member of the OCC's Executive Committee and was the Chair of the Technology and Systems Subcommittee.

Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin designated Brooks the OCC's First Deputy Comptroller, under his authority set forth in 12 USC § 4. Pursuant to 12 USC § 4, Brooks became Acting Comptroller upon Comptroller Otting's resignation on May 29, 2020.

On May 29, 2020, Brooks signed a final rule to clarify the long-standing "valid when made" doctrine to clarify that when a national bank or savings association sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers a loan, interest permissible before the transfer continues to be permissible after the transfer.

On October 27, 2020, Brooks signed an OCC rule to clarify when a national bank or federal savings association (bank) makes a loan and is the “true lender,” including in the context of a partnership between a bank and a third party.

On November 20, 2020, the OCC, under Brooks, proposed a rule that it argued would ensure “fair access” to banking services provided by national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign bank organizations. The rule, which was proposed after President Trump had already lost the election and which the head of the Bank Policy Institute called “poorly constructed,” will force banks to lend to payday lenders, gun companies and others even if they do not support the activities such companies engage in. It was finalized on January 14, 2021.


### Community Reinvestment Act

On May 20, 2020, the OCC, under Joseph Otting finalized a rule to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act for national banks and savings associations. According to the OCC, the final rule will increase bank CRA-related lending, investment, and services in low- and moderate-income communities where there is significant need for credit, more responsible lending, and greater access to banking services by:

* Clarifying what qualifies for CRA consideration.
* Updating how banks define assessment areas by retaining immediate geographies around branches and establishing additional assessment areas for banks that do not rely on branch networks to serve their customers.
* Evaluating bank CRA performance more objectively through quantitative measures that assess the volume and value of activity.
* Making reporting more transparent and timelier.
* Providing greater support for small businesses, small and family-owned farms, and Indian Country.
* Thoroughly evaluating banks’ CRA performance in all their assessment areas, not just a limited evaluation in some of them.

The U.S. Senate upheld the rule on October 19, 2020, when it rejected a resolution under the Congressional Review act to overturn the rule.


### Responsible Innovation

On July 10, 2020, Brooks announced the launch of Project REACh. REACh stands for Roundtable for Economic Access and Change, and the project brings together leaders from the banking industry, national civil rights organizations, business, and technology to reduce specific barriers that prevent full, equal, and fair participation in the nation's economy.

On July 22, 2020, the OCC, under Brooks' direction, published a letter clarifying national banks' and federal savings associations' authority to provide cryptocurrency custody services for customers. The letter concludes that providing cryptocurrency custody services, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency, is a modern form of traditional bank activities related to custody services. Crypto custody services may extend beyond passively holding "keys." On September 21, 2020, the OCC, under Brooks, issued a second letter regarding cryptocurrencies, which clarified national bank and savings association authority to hold deposits reserves backing stablecoins.


### Charters and Licensing

On July 31, 2020, Brooks signed the first full-service national bank charter for a consumer-focused financial technology company engaged in the business of banking—Varo Bank N.A. In making the announcement, Brooks said the bank's opening "represents the evolution of banking and a new generation of banks that are born from innovation and built on technology intended to empower consumers and businesses." Under Brooks's leadership, the OCC also approved the merger of fintech payments startup Jiko and Mid-Central Federal Savings Bank, marking the first time a fintech was approved to acquire an existing insured depository institution. Fintech startup SoFi also received conditional approval from the OCC for a de novo national bank charter during Brooks's tenure.

On January 13, 2021, the OCC under Brooks conditionally approved of "the conversion of Anchorage Trust Company, a South Dakota chartered trust company, to become Anchorage Digital Bank, National Association."


### Significant Enforcement Actions

On August 6, 2020, a Brooks-led OCC assessed an $80 million civil money penalty against Capital One, N.A., and Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., related to the bank's 2019 cyber breach, which affected millions of customers.

On September 21, 2020, the OCC took enforcement against three former senior executives of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for their roles in the bank's systemic sales practices misconduct. The settlements included: (1) a prohibition order and $925,000 civil money penalty (CMP) to former Community Bank Group Finance Officer Matthew Raphaelson; (2) a personal cease and desist order (PC&D) and $400,000 CMP to the former Head of Community Bank Deposit Products Group Kenneth Zimmerman; and (3) a PC&D and $350,000 CMP to the former Head of Community Bank Human Resources Tracy Kidd.

On October 7, 2020, under Brooks, the OCC issued a $400 million civil money penalty against Citibank related to deficiencies in enterprise-wide risk management, compliance risk management, data governance, and internal controls.

On October 8, 2020, the OCC fined Morgan Stanley Bank NA and Morgan Stanley Private Bank NA $60 million for risk management problems tied to a 2016 data breach.

On October 14, 2020, the OCC fined USAA Federal Savings Bank $85 million "for shortcomings in its risk management and compliance with laws protecting service members."

On November 24, 2020, the OCC under Brooks fined JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $250 million for "failure to maintain adequate internal controls and internal audit over its fiduciary business."
