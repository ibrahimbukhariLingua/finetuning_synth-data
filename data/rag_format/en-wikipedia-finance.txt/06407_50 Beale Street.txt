Completed in 1967, the building served as the world headquarters for Bechtel before the company moved to Reston, Virginia. The building has also served as headquarters for Blue Shield of California between 1996 and 2018. In 2006, Blue Shield renewed its lease and acquired naming rights to the building. The building has formerly been known as the **Bechtel Building** and subsequently the **Blue Shield of California Building**.

Broadway Partners acquired the building in 2007. A joint venture of The Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate New York acquired the building in September 2012. The building was sold to Paramount Group, Inc. for approximately US$395 million in September 2014.

The building features a 1920 railcar used by Steve Bechtel. The private railcar was the Bechtel family home in the 1920's and was the living quarters of the Bechtels when constructing the Hoover Dam.
