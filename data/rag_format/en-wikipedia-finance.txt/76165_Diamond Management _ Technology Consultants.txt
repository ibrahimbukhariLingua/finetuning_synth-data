## History

Diamond was founded as Diamond Technology Partners in Chicago in 1994 by Mel Bergstein and Chris Moffitt with investment from founding partners and Safeguard Scientifics. The firm went public in early 1998. On 2000-11-28 the company was renamed to DiamondCluster International, Inc. as part of a merger with European management consulting firm Cluster Consulting. In 2006, the company was again renamed, this time to Diamond Management & Technology Consultants, Inc. as it divested portions of its international operations.
As of 3 November 2010, Diamond Management & Technology Consultants was acquired by PwC and renamed into Diamond Advisory Services. Before the acquisition, Diamond had also acquired few boutique consulting firms in US.

Diamond had, throughout its history, well-defined relationships with major technology pioneers such as Alan Kay, a member of the board of directors, as well as John Perry Barlow, Gordon Bell, David P. Reed, Dan Ariely, Matthew Peterson and Dan Bricklin, all regular faculty members of the privately branded industry conference called Diamond Exchange. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
