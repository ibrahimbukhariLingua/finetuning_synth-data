## Career


### Publishing career

Around 21, as Joint-stock company activities flourished post-Companies Act 1862, he began his London-based writing career, later publishing his debut work after years of writing for provincial newspapers.


#### *Stock Exchange Year Book*

Between 1874 and 1875, he compiled and published the first edition of *The Stock Exchange Year-Book*, an annual publication covering an overview of joint-stock companies and public securities in the UK market for investors. It was first published at five shillings, and contained over 200 pages, gradually increasing year by year. By October 1883, it had reached its tenth year.


#### *Directory of Directors*

In May 1880, he compiled and edited the first annual publication of the *Directory of Directors* which was published in London. Skinner used company reports and other reliable sources to compile the information on around 6,000 directors and their companies in industry, commerce, and finance. The 1881 issue, published at the Royal Exchange buildings, featured 7,500 directors and grew from 272 to 384 pages.


#### *The London Banks*

That same year in 1880, the financial journalist set his sights on acquiring the copyright of *London Banks and Kindred Companies and Firms*, first published in December 1865 under the title *The London Banks, Credit, Discount, and Finance Companies*. In November 1880, Skinner replaced Edwin Utley as the chief editor and publisher of *The London Banks, and Kindred Companies and Firms*. The publication compiled information regarding banks and companies that made up the London Money Market. In 1881, the Leeds Mercury reported "Mr. Skinner has already added features to it which increase its value."


#### *Bankers' Almanac*

Sir Thomas Skinner later took over a semi-annual publication established in 1844-45 titled the *Bankers' Almanac* in East Grinstead, England. It became popularly known as "Skinner's" and was a directory of thousands of major banks in alphabetical order. The periodical *London Banks and Kindred Companies and Firms* was merged into the *Bankers' Almanac* in 1919.


### Canadian Pacific Railway Co.

In 1881, an invitation was extended for Skinner to become involved in Canadian interests. In February 1881, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company was incorporated to build and manage a transcontinental railway extending from St. John, New Brunswick, and Montreal, Quebec, to Vancouver, British Columbia. His understanding of London's financial markets supported efforts to secure funding for the Canadian Pacific Railway. He produced a weekly journal to provide information and promote the Canadian Pacific Railway during its construction.


#### Canada North-West Land Co.

In 1882, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company established the Anglo-Canadian Canada North-West Land Company, chaired by Sir Thomas Skinner.


#### *The Canadian Gazette*

Now chairman of the Canada North-West Land Company, in April 1883, he served as the founder, chief editor, and publisher of the *Canadian Gazette*. The London-based weekly paper featured Canadian news, emigration topics, and investment opportunities. It was primarily financed by George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen who had recently resigned as President of the Bank of Montreal to focus on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Skinner became regarded as a leading authority on Canadian investments.


#### CPR Director

In 1888, he was first elected to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's Board of Directors as its London-based financial director.


#### Colonization Board

On 26 December 1888, a temporary board was created to oversee the migration of crofters and cottars from the Western Highlands and Scottish islands to the Dominion of Canada. The Crofter Emigration Board was composed of Schomberg Kerr, 9th Marquess of Lothian, the Secretary for Scotland; Sir Charles Tupper, the High Commissioner for the Dominion of Canada in London; Sir John Muir, 1st Baronet, the Lord Provost of Glasgow; and Thomas Skinner of the North-West Land Co. Officially appointed by Queen Victoria in 1891, for many years he served on the Colonization Board, set up to support Canadian colonization. The board had been reconstituted in November 1891, given extended authority over the
Congested Districts Board for Ireland, and joined by Sir Horace Plunkett.

In August 1889, after traveling with CPR President William Cornelius Van Horne across the Canadian North-West, the CPR director, chairman of the Northwest Land Co., and royal commissioner was impressed by the region's condition and potential. He did, however, address a problem with a stretch of the Government Railway along the Thompson River.


### Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Co.

He was appointed chairman of the board of the Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills Co. Ltd. in 1889, following a British financial syndicate's acquisition and merger of Pillsbury with a competitor.

In April 1891, he was elected as a Director of the Commercial Cable Company which was registered in 1883. He announced the news to the public in *The Canadian Gazette*. The company was engaged in manufacturing and owning both underwater telegraph cables and land-based lines.


### Bank of Montreal

In 1894, Skinner became a member (and later chairman) of the London-based advisory committee of the Bank of Montreal on 22 Abchurch Lane. Serving from the mid-1890s to the 1920s, he worked on the committee with Alexander Lang and Sir Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, who presided over the bank's board of directors.

Recommended to the Canadian Government in 1894 as Peter Redpath's successor on the Imperial Institute's Council, representing the Northwest Territories, he accepted the role at their request. By this time, he lived at Broughton Lodge, Highgate, worked from 1 Royal Exchange Buildings, E.C., and was affiliated with London's Junior Athenaeum Club.

The Canadian Pacific Railway Company director worked closely on advancing railway interests with James J. Hill, the Canadian president of the Great Northern Railway, and George Stephen, former BMO president and cousin of Sir Donald A. Smith. He was among four who signed the London agreement on 10 May 1895 to acquire the Northern Pacific Railway for the Great Northern Railway.


### Halifax & Bermuda Co.

In 1897, London-based Sir Thomas Skinner held the roles of Trustee and Director for the Halifax and Bermudas Cable Company, alongside Sir Donald A. Smith. He also chaired the Board of Directors, including Charles R. Hosmer, T.G.H. G’ynn, and Joseph Rippon.


#### Direct West India Cable Co.

The Direct West India Cable Company Ltd. was founded on 2 August 1897 to take over a contract between the Halifax & Bermuda Co. and the British government for managing a submarine cable route linking Bermuda, Jamaica, and Turks Island. Following its registration on 1 September 1897, Sir Skinner maintained roles as Trustee and Director of the Direct West India Cable Company Ltd. alongside Lord Strathcona, serving as chairman at its British headquarters on Old Broad Street. Banking services for the company were provided by the Bank of Montreal. By 1915, his son Sir T. Hewitt Skinner was also a director of the firm.

At the end of the 19th century, Skinner was appointed Deputy Governor of Hudson's Bay Company in London, succeeding Earl of Lichfield Sir Donald Smith.

In 1903, he was elected to The Mackay Companies, a voluntary association formed by Clarence H. Mackay (fellow Commercial Cable Company director) under the trust deed of 19 December 1902. The Commercial Cable Co. became a subsidiary under The Mackay Companies. Holding the entire capital stock of Commercial Cable Co., the association also owned full or partial shares in multiple telegraph and cable companies in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, including Postal Telegraph and Cable Co.

By October 1910, Skinner resided on 22 Pont Street in Chelsea, London and at The Gables, Worthing with offices at 77-81 Gresham House. He was a Justice of the peace of Middlesex.

He presented the President of The Canada Club in London with a chain and badge of office in 1909. London's Canada Club also hosted Skinner as a principal guest on 8 February 1912.

Hewitt Skinner, 2nd Baronet, succeeded him on the committee.
