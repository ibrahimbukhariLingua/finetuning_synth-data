## Economic Theories and Policy Proposals

* **Law of Fertility, Prosperity, and Immigration**In his book *The Price of Prosperity*, Buchholz says that when a nation's annual average GDP rate exceeds 2.5 percent for two consecutive 25-year periods (two generations), the fertility rate will drop to just over the replacement level, that is, 2.5 children per female. If GDP continues to grow for a third consecutive generation, the fertility rate will tend to drop below 2.1 children per female and the population will require immigration to maintain a stable working population. As a corollary, if the fertility rate falls below the replacement rate, the nation will find it extraordinarily difficult to pay down accumulated debt.
* On the editorial page of the *Wall Street Journal* in June 2012, Buchholz proposed the U.S. Treasury lock in record low borrowing rates by issuing 100-year bonds. With the 10-year Treasury yielding just 1.62%, Buchholz called it the "best deal since Pope Julius paid a pittance to have Michelangelo paint his ceiling." Fourteen months after the article appeared, yields had risen by 78 percent to 2.88%.
* In his book *Rush*, Buchholz argues from neuroscience and history that competitive societies achieve longer life expectancy, less disease, and greater measures of cooperation than societies that try to quash competitiveness.
* In 2011, on the front page of *The Washington Post*'s Outlook section, Buchholz proposed turning unemployment compensation into signing bonuses. Instead of collecting 99 weeks of unemployment payments, under Buchholz's proposal, individuals would receive a signing bonus from the government if they accepted a job sooner.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
* **The Buchholz Hypothesis** holds that crime is strongly correlated with interest rates.
* In his book *New Ideas from Dead Economists*, Buchholz argues that small countries with large social welfare programs may achieve strong GDP gains because they are able to free-ride on the gains generated by countries that promote a more competitive structure with less governmental intervention.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
* In a 2019 essay reprinted in the *South China Morning Post* and a variety of global publications, Buchholz claimed that sluggish worldwide growth was actually benefitting the U.S. economy. He projected that slow GDP growth among U.S. trading partners was keeping interest rates remarkably low and inflation well-contained, which is more important for the U.S. economy than the loss of export growth. This is a rare situation, he stated, that confounds the standard textbook explanations.

## Economic Forecasting

* In a 2021 *Wall Street Journal* editorial, Buchholz warned of an inflation surge that would exceed the forecasts of the Federal Reserve Board and the White House. Buchholz argued that inflation was not just in the goods sector, but would climb sharply in the services sector, too.
* In January 2014, in an essay entitled "Green Acres Turning Red," Buchholz forecast a sharp decline in farmland prices, following a sharp multi-year rally. Buchholz stated that prices were "teetering on the slope of something ugly and parabolic." Over the next two years, farmland rental rates dropped by almost 20 percent.
* In April 2014, with the price of oil at approximately $100 per barrel, Buchholz appeared on Fox Business Channel with Maria Bartiromo and correctly forecast that the price of oil would plunge to $50 per barrel.
* In 2011, in keynote speeches and in television and radio interviews, Buchholz forecast that the Standard and Poor's (S&P) rating agency would downgrade U.S. Treasury debt. On August 5, S&P announced the downgrade of U.S. debt from AAA to AA+.
* In February 2009, Buchholz forecasted an economic recovery from the "Great Recession." In a speech to the Americas Lodging Investment Summit, Buchholz forecast that "we're going to have an economic recovery just in time for back-to-school sales in September" and that "lodging and hospitality is going to benefit from this upswing as well." GDP did turn positive in the third quarter of 2009.
* In April 2008, on the PBS Nightly Business Report, Buchholz forecast that commodity prices, including oil, would climb higher in the short-term but then tumble during the summer of 2008.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On July 13, 2008, addressing the Southern Legislative Conference, when oil prices were $137 per barrel and leading Wall Street analysts were forecasting a move to $200, Buchholz predicted that prices would fall by half over the next six months. Over the following eight weeks, prices of commodities such as oil, grain, and industrial metals started to crumble, and the price of oil fell significantly.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
* In an opening keynote speech at Everything Channel's 2008 VARBusiness 300 Conference in June 2008, Buchholz said he believed that the U.S. economy, while undoubtedly in a slowdown, would avoid two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, the classic definition of a recession. "I'm convinced we're not going to have any quarters of negative GDP", he added. Buchholz cited high employment, lean inventories at manufacturers, and strong exports, spurred by the weaker dollar, as reasons for his beliefs.
* In Buchholz's 2007 book *New Ideas from Dead CEOs*, published shortfly before the commercial launch of the Airbus A380, Buchholz criticized the project for inadequate testing of the engineering, commercial, and financial viability: "Airbus gathered orders for the behemoth A380 before the company knew how to build it." In 2019, faced with inadequate orders and unsustainable operational costs, Airbus announced that it would cease production.
* Buchholz's 1999 book *Market Shock* warned that the Eurozone was unstable and headed toward political turmoil.
