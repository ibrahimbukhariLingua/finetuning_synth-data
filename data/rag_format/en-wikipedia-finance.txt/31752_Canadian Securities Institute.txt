# Canadian Securities Institute



The **Canadian Securities Institute** (**CSI**; formerly, **CSI Global Education**) is a Canadian organization that offers licensing courses, advanced certifications, continuing education and custom training for financial services professionals in Canada and internationally.

CSI provides licensing and testing to meet the regulatory requirements to work within the Canadian financial services industry. It is endorsed by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), and Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA).

CSI is based in Toronto and Montreal and owned by Moody's Analytics. The credentials offered by the institute are recognized by several foreign securities regulators, including those in the U.S., France, U.K., Singapore and Hong Kong.


## Courses, programs and certificates

The Canadian Securities Institute offers 100 courses, 11 certificate programs, specialized designations, as well as continuing education programs for Canadian financial professionals, primarily in the area of financial advice.

The Canadian Securities Course is widely viewed by Canada's financial services sector as the de facto entry requirement for many careers of its paths.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ First offered in 1964, it has remained an exclusive part of the proficiency requirement to be registered as an investment advisor with an IIROC member firm. The CSC is recognized as a requirement for mutual fund representatives and exempt market dealer representatives.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ CSI also provides a simplified version for motivated investors who wish to increase their financial literacy/knowledge but do not plan a career as stockbrokers.

CSI offers programs and courses through a variety of formats including distance (primarily online) and in class, to make them as accessible as possible. Some courses are available through Ontario community colleges (e.g., Fanshawe College in London, Ontario and Centennial College in Toronto). The PFP may be applied to an MBA (Financial Services) at Dalhousie University.
