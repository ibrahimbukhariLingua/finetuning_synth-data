Functioning as a non-profit corporation headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Meritas operates on an invitation-only basis with its member firms requiring recertification every three years in order to maintain their membership.


## Membership

Jennifer McPhee, writing for *Canadian Lawyer*, described Meritas as one of the "more established by-invitation only legal networks that do extensive research before carefully selecting one firm per jurisdiction." *Corporate Counsel Weekly* also wrote, "Meritas determines significant business or economic centers where member firms' clients may need local counsel in order to determine where it will have its members," and that "...all member firms provide Meritas with quarterly referral reports, listing all Meritas-originated referrals made to and from the firm for the stated period and cooperate in evaluating specific matters." If a firm does not receive good marks, its membership with the organization may be terminated.
