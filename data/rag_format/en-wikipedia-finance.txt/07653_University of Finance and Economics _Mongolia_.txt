## Student union

The University of Ulaanbaatar for Finance & Economics has a Student Union formed by students. Financially supported by the school administration, the Union organizes socio-cultural activities as well as extracurricular academics activities.

The earlier structure of the Union was the Student Council which was relatively small, founded in 1997. Until 2001 there was no stability in student organization activity. In 2001, the Student Council changed its name to Student Union and started to expand. On April 10, 2004, the Student Union changed its name to back to Student Council. The reason for this change is uncertain. The latest change of its name occurred on October 1, 2007: the Student Council changed its status to a non-government organization hence called Student Union.

The Student Union is governed by the Student Assembly, although day-to-day workings of the Union are handled by the Executive Committee. Representatives for the Student Assembly, the Chair's Office are elected/appointed between October and November each academic year.
