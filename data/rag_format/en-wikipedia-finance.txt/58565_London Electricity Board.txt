London Electricity Board


# London Electricity Board



The **London Electricity Board** was the public sector utility company responsible for the supply and distribution of electricity to domestic, commercial and industrial consumers in London prior to 1990. It also sold and made available for hire and hire-purchase domestic electrical appliances through local showrooms where electricity bills could also be paid. It was shortened to **LEB** in its green and blue logo, consisting of the three letters. As *London Electricity plc* it was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.


## History

The board was formed as the London Electricity Board on 1 April 1948 as part of the nationalisation of the electricity industry by the Electricity Act 1947. The LEB was privatised in 1990 under the Electricity Act 1989, as London Electricity plc.

The company was acquired by *Entergy*, a US company, in 1996 and then by *Électricité de France* in November 1998. It then traded under the name *EDF Energy Networks* as did the South Eastern and Eastern distribution companies also owned by EDF, until EDF sold them all under the name *UK Power Networks* to Hong Kong based investors in 2010.

Notable employees of the business include former prime minister John Major and the former archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.
