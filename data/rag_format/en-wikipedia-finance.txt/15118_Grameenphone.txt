## History

Founder Muhammad Yunus founded Grameenphone to provide universal mobile phone access throughout Bangladesh, including its rural areas. He was inspired by the Grameen Bank micro-credit model and envisioned a business model where a cell phone can serve as a source of income. After leaving his job as an investment banker in the United States, Quadir met and successfully raised money from New York-based investor and philanthropist Joshua Mailman. He then returned to Bangladesh and worked for three years to gain support from organizations such as Grameen Bank and the Norwegian telecom company, Telenor.


### Changing logo

## Numbering scheme

Grameenphone uses the following numbering scheme for its subscribers:

* **+880 13 XXXXXXXX**

* **+880 17 XXXXXXXX**

**880** is the ISD code for Bangladesh and is needed only in case of dialing from outside Bangladesh (otherwise, it may be substituted by a 0, making the prefix 013 & 017).

**13** & **17** is the prefix for Grameenphone as allocated by the government of Bangladesh. The following eight-digit number **XXXXXXXX** is the subscriber number. After exhausting the 017 series, Grameenphone became the first operator to launch a second series, the 013.
