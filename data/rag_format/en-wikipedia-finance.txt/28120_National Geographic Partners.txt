National Geographic Partners


# National Geographic Partners



**National Geographic Partners, LLC** is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company (which owns 73% of the company) and the namesake non-profit scientific organization National Geographic Society (which owns 27%). The company oversees all commercial activities related to the Society, including magazine publications and television channels. The company's board of managers is evenly divided between the Society and Disney.

The enterprise was originally established by 21st Century Fox and the National Geographic Society. Following the completion of Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox on March 20, 2019, Disney assumed 21CF's 73% share in the joint venture.


## Background

National Geographic Society's relationship with 21st Century Fox goes as far back as 1997, when the original News Corporation (to which 21st Century Fox is one of the successors) launched National Geographic Channel (now simply branded as National Geographic) in Asia and Europe, in partnership with the Society. The original American version of the channel was launched in 2001. Additional National Geographic channels in other parts of the world were also launched under the original joint venture.


## History

On September 9, 2015, the Society announced that it would reorganize its media properties and publications into a new company known as National Geographic Partners, which would be 73% owned by 21st Century Fox. This new, for-profit, corporation would own *National Geographic* and other magazines, as well as its affiliated television networks—most of which were already owned in joint ventures with Fox. At the time of the deal's announcement, James Murdoch, the CEO of 21st Century Fox, said in remarks to National Geographic that the pact created "an expanded canvas for the National Geographic brand to grow and reach customers in new ways, and to reach new customers." On November 2, 2015, roughly two weeks before the closing of the expanded joint venture deal, National Geographic and 21st Century Fox announced that 9 percent of National Geographic's 2,000 employees, approximately 180 people, would be laid off, constituting the biggest staff reduction in the Society's history. In November 2015, National Geographic Channels International CEO Ward Platt was promoted to National Geographic Partners, while the channel international and US were united under National Geographic Channels U.S. CEO Courteney Monroe as National Geographic Global Networks.

National Geographic Networks announced the production of four feature documentaries and reentry of NatGeo back into documentaries. Soon thereafter in January 2017, the network announced National Geographic Documentary Films banner for the four features.

In May 2017, the company acquired Global Adrenaline tour operator, a provider of National Geographic Expeditions for some its land-based itineraries and was founded in 2001 by CEO Nancy Schumacher.

SPE brought on Falcon's Creative Group, Pixomondo, Mirada Studios, and composer David Kahne for the attraction's creative aspects. Ocean Odyssey was a 90 minutes timed ticketed walk-through attraction with retail space plus private event space managed by The Shubert Organization. The attraction had closed by 2021.

Declan Moore was succeeded by Gary E. Knell as CEO of Nat Geo Partners in February 2018. In July, Moore reorganized the company including eliminating three top executive posts. Global network CEO would oversee a combine long and short form production company, National Geographic Studios. NG Media, as a one newsroom for content on all platforms, was formed bring digital, magazines and other short form content together. CFO Marcela Martin added the chief administrative officer (CAO) post leading the new Operating Council coordinating support functions.

A partnership with Ultimate Explorer, a Chinese company, was made for interactive entertainment spaces based on the series in China and the U.S. With its second series published in October 2019, the kids book unit launched a companion podcast.

As a part of the acquisition of most 21st Century Fox assets, The Walt Disney Company took over 21CF's controlling stake in the joint venture. Following the acquisition, National Geographic Partners' television channels became part of the Walt Disney Television unit, with the president of the National Geographic Partners reporting directly to the Walt Disney Television chairman. Disney officially closed the deal on March 20, 2019. By August 2019, National Geographic Partners' non-TV operations were transferred into its Disney counterpart.
