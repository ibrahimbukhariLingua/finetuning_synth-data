**Agriculture in Greece** is deeply rooted in history, and based on its Mediterranean climate. This practice encompasses a wide array of crops, including olives, grapes, citrus fruits, cereals, and vegetables, with a notable emphasis on olive oil production, establishing Greece as a global leader in this industry. The country's vineyards produce tons of grapes and also yield renowned wines. Greece also produces a wide variety of livestock products. Fisheries are playing an important role while forestry plays a secondary role.

Greek agriculture is based on small, family-owned dispersed units. Currently, 47,9% of agricultural land is arable land, 27,4% is composed of tree plantations, 2,1% is composed of vines and 22,4% is composed of other cultivations (mostly used as pasture land). Greek agriculture employs 615,000 farmers, 12,4% of the total labor force. It produces more than 4,2% of the national GDP, occupies 2.824.449 hectares of land and is the main source of occupation for the majority of rural areas in the country.


## Current production

Currently, Greek agriculture like other countries of the European Union is heavily subsidized by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Certain deductions of subsidies are planned within the next decade.

Greece produced in 2018:

* 1.2 million tons of maize;
* 1 million tons of olive (5th largest producer in the world, behind Spain, Italy, Morocco and Turkey);

## Modern history


### 19th century

In the 19th century, Greek agriculture was very basic. Implements found in western Europe had not yet appeared. The following description was reported by William Henry Moffett, American Consul in Athens and was published in the American periodical *Garden and Forest* (Volume 2, Issue 95, 18 December 1889, p. 612: published by Garden and Forest Publishing Co., Tribune Building, New York, N.Y.):


### 20th century

Greek agricultural production was vastly expanded in the 20th century, as per the information given elsewhere on this page. In particular grain production (wheat, barley, etc.) has been significantly increased using more modern farming methods. Much of the research on soil classification, fertiliser use, and dissemination of improved agricultural practice was carried out starting from 1938 in the Kanellopoulos Institute of Chemistry and Agriculture.

The main varieties of domestic wheat produced in Greece during 2002 were FLAVIO, VAVAROS and MEXA.

In 2020 Greece had 530,679 farms, a 26,6% decrease from 2009 when it had 723,006 farms. 12,588 of those were certified organic or under conversion, a decrease of 23,5% from 2009 when organic farms amounted to 16,448, but at the same time the number of hectares certified as organic increased by 19,3% from 130.828 hectares in 2009 to 156.058 hectares in 2020.
