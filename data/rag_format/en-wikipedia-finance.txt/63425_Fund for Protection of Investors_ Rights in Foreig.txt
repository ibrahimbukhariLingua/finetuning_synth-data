## Important cases


### Bank Snoras: lawsuit against the Republic of Lithuania

On November 16, 2011, the government of Lithuania adopted the Resolution No. 1329 “On withdrawal of Bank Snoras shares for public needs” with the payment of compensation to shareholders. The compensation hasn't been paid to this day.

On November 24, 2011, Bank of Lithuania revoked the license of Bank Snoras following the report of the interim manager Simon Freakley.
In August, 2016 the former majority shareholder of Bank Snoras, with the support of the Fund, filed a lawsuit in Moscow Arbitration Court against the Republic of Lithuania to recover property damage (material damage) in the amount of 20,209,353,110 rubles, to compensate for the damage to the business reputation in the amount of 19,904,862,500 rubles and to declare false the information that had been disseminated by the President of the Republic of Lithuania and further reposted by the online media.

Lithuania has used the right of state immunity from the jurisdiction of Russian courts.

In 2019 the Fund filed a lawsuit for the illegal nationalization of Bank Snoras in the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The preliminary amount of the claim is 1.1 billion euros.

Also the Fund's human rights defenders applied to the New York court to oblige Simon Freakley (the interim bank manager for the period of nationalization) and his new company AlixPartners to provide documents confirming the shortage in the capital of Bank Snoras and justifying the nationalization and expropriation.

Lithuania tried to challenge this appeal, but it was declined in court. The media called this decision the Fund's first victory in the case.


### Lawsuit against National bank TRUST

On April 15, 2020, the Fund for the Protection of Investors’ Rights in Foreign Countries filed a lawsuit with the High Court of Justice (London, UK) against Trust Bank and its former owners and top managers Ilya Yurov, Sergey Belyaev and Nikolay Fetisov, as well as their wives. The preliminary amount of the claim is 300 million pounds.

The Fund represents the interests of a group of investors (former clients of Trust Bank) who invested in credit-linked notes distributed by the bank to its major depositors. Due to illegal and unfair actions of the former owners of Trust Bank, deceived investors lost all their funds put in credit-linked notes, since the credit-linked notes were canceled as a result of the actions of Ilya Yurov, Nikolai Fetisov and Sergei Belyaev.

The application to the High Court of Justice and the right of this court to consider the claim is based on the fact that Mr. Yurov and Mr. Fetisov, as well as their spouses, currently live in England.

According to British lawyers, the case can be considered within a year, since the High Court of Justice has recently ruled against Yurov, Belyaev and Fetisov on the lawsuit of National Bank TRUST, which resolved a large number of issues also related to the case of the Fund. The court decided that all three bankers were involved in the fraudulent scheme and bear responsibility for the bank collapse in December, 2014.
