## History

Transport company, Bolt diversified into food delivery in August 2019, launching Bolt Food in Tallinn, Estonia and announcing plans to expand the service to Latvia, Lithuania, and South Africa later that year.

During the launch, Bolt's Chief Product Officer, Jevgeni Kabanov, said that establishing a food delivery service had been a popular request from existing Bolt users for quite some time.

In April 2021, the Bolt Food app was added to the Huawei AppGallery after Huawei claimed to have received more than 2,000 requests for users to onboard the mobile app.

In August 2021, Bolt raised €600 million to launch the Bolt Market grocery delivery service.

In January 2022, the company announced that it had raised €628 million at a €7.4 billion valuation to expand its transport and food delivery super app.

As of January 2023, Bolt Food operates in more than 80 cities and 19 countries in Europe and Africa.
