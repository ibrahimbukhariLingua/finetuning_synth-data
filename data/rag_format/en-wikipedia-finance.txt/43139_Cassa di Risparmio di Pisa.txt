## History

Cassa di Risparmio di Pisa was formed on 15 June 1834.


### Casse Toscane

Due to Legge Amato, the bank was split into an *ente* and a società per azioni on 7 April 1992 (gazetted on 6 May). About 13.05% shares of the new company were non-voting saving shares (Italian: *Azione di risparmio*). The *ente* immediately sold about 70% shares to Casse Toscane (and received 11.5% shares of Casse Toscane), a new intermediate holding company for the saving bank (Italian: *Cassa di Risparmio*) of Pisa, Florence, Livorno, Lucca, Pistoia–Pescia, San Miniato and Banca del Monte di Lucca. The *ente* only hold about 16.95% voting rights of the bank directly or about 25% combined (excluding the saving shares).


### Casse del Tirreno

In 1995, CR Pisa, Livorno, Lucca and Banca Monte Lucca quit the union and formed Holding Casse del Tirreno (literally *Tyrrhenian saving banks*).


### Banca Popolare di Lodi

In 1999, C.R. Pisa, Livorno and Lucca were acquired by Banca Popolare di Lodi (BPL) through sub-holding companies.

In 2000 C.R. Pisa had 59 branches. At that time Casse del Tirreno owned 61.69% shares of C.R. Pisa S.p.A.. Istituto di Credito delle Casse di Risparmio Italiane acted as an intermediate holding company (ICCRI, a subsidiary of Bipielle Partecipazioni, another intermediate holding company) that owned 50.01% Casse del Tirreno. However, CR Pisa SpA also owned 1.35% of Casse del Tirreno.

In 2001 Casse del Tirreno was absorbed into ICCRI – Banca Federale Europea (ex-ICCRI), which hold 61.31% shares of CR Pisa; Bipielle Partecipazioni owned an additional 12.97% shares of CR Pisa S.p.A. Pisa Foundation also became a minority shareholders of ICCRI for 7.32%, due to the transactions.

In 2002 Bipielle Retail became the new intermediate holding company for the 74.28% shares, while Pisa Foundation owned 25.63% shares of CR Pisa S.p.A., as well as 3.91% of BPL's sub-holding Bipielle Investimenti.

In 2003, through CR Lucca S.p.A. (and another intermediate holding company Reti Bancarie), BPL completely privatized CR Pisa SpA. Pisa Foundation owned 7.48% shares of CR Lucca S.p.A. instead. However, BPL and Pisa Foundation also signed an agreement on 12 December 2003 that BPL would buy the shares from the foundation before 15 January 2008. BPL also bought the shares of Bipielle Investimenti from the foundation.


### Absorbed to CR Lucca Pisa Livorno
