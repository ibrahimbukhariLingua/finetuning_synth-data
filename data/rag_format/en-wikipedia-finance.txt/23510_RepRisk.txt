# RepRisk



**RepRisk AG** is an environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) data science company based in Zurich, Switzerland, specializing in ESG and business-conduct risk research, and quantitative solutions.

The company runs an online due-diligence database that allows clients to monitor and assess the risk exposure of companies, infrastructure projects, sectors, and countries related to 28 ESG issues. The issues are mapped to the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Materiality Map, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

On a daily basis, RepRisk assesses ESG risks such as environmental degradation, human rights abuses, child labor, forced labor, fraud, and corruption that can impact an organization's reputation, financial profitability, or lead to compliance issues. Financial institutions and corporations use RepRisk to prevent and mitigate ESG and business conduct risks related to their operations, business relationships, and investments.

The RepRisk database systematically identifies ESG risks by analyzing over 100,000 sources per day in 20 major business languages. As of July 2020, the database covered more than 150,000 public and private companies, and over 40,000 infrastructure projects reported to have links to ESG risks, as well as ESG risks related to all countries and 34 different sectors. It also includes data on ESG issues and topics, over 20,000 NGOs, and over 15,000 governmental bodies.


## History

RepRisk was formed in 1998 as ECOFACT, a Zurich-based environmental and social risk consultancy focused on the financial sector. In 2006, its ESG risk database was created at the request of UBS, and in 2010, RepRisk split from the consultancy and became an independent company.
