In partnership with Aim Higher Africa, GIGL launched a "Back-2-School Giveaway" in 2019, where school backpacks filled with school supplies are given to children residing in low-income communities in Ghana.

Following the ban of motorcycle taxis in parts of Lagos, Nigeria in January 2020, motorcycle taxi-hailing companies entered into discussions with GIGL in a bid to convert their motorcycles into dispatch vehicles under the company.

In 2020, Jet Motor Company, an African automobile manufacturer announced that it entered a partnership with GIGL that would see the GIGL's service centres in Nigeria serve as charging stations for electric vehicles, while GIGL adds a number of Jet Motor's electric vehicles to its fleet.
