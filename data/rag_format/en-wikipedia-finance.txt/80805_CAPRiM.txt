CAPRiM


# CAPRiM



**CAPRiM Ltd** (**Corporate Asset Protection and Risk Management**) was an intelligence service used by corporations.


## Background

CAPRiM was established in May 1993 as a successor to the Economic League, which had held the construction industry's blacklist until it was wound up in 1993 after a parliamentary inquiry and bad press. It provided continued employment for two former League directors, Jack Winder and Stan Hardy. The construction company Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd invested Â£10,000 in founding CAPRiM on the understanding that it would not interfere with The Consulting Association.


## Targets

In evidence given to the Scottish Parliamentary Affairs Committee, as part of its inquiry into blacklisting on 5 February 2013, the former CAPRiM director Jack Winder said that it held information and knowledge on campaigning groups and "far-left" political parties seen as a threat to businesses such as the following:

* Greenpeace
* Reclaim the Streets
* Ethical consumerism
* Campaign Against the Arms Trade
* Animal rights
* Anti-GM activists

CAPRiM warned firms of those that it believed could "weaken a company's ability to manage its affairs profitably". Its monitor said: "Companies need to be warned what these organisations are saying and planning. Caprim provides this information. And assesses the strength of the threat. And advises on appropriate action".


## Directors

Jack Winder claimed that the joint managing directors were himself and Stan Hardy, and its non-executive directors were Sir Henry Saxon Tate CBE (of Tate & Lyle) and Bernard Norman Sefton-Forbes. Hardy had previously been the director-general of the Economic League and was a director of CAPRiM until at least 1999.
