Co-op Food


# Co-op Food



**Co-op** is a UK supermarket chain and the brand used for the food retail business of The Co-operative Group, one of the world’s largest consumer co-operatives. As the UK’s fifth largest food retailer, Co-op operates nearly 2,400 food stores. It also supplies products to over 6,000 other stores, including those run by independent co-operative societies, through its wholesale business, Nisa Retail Limited.

Co-op is owned by millions of UK consumers and employs 56,000 people, with an annual turnover of more than £11 billion. The organisation is known for its involvement in social and community programmes.

Before reintroducing the Co-op brand in 2016, the group used "The Co-operative" branding, which some consumers' co-operative societies in the UK continue to use, while others have adopted their own branding.

In 2024, Co-op introduced a new brand platform, "Owned by You. Right By You." This was developed in response to findings that over 50% of consumers did not fully understand the concept of a co-operative or mutual business.


## Operations

The "Co-op" brand is used by over 3,500 shops owned by various societies which make up the co-operative movement, including the Central England Co-operative. A number of co-operative societies including Scotmid and the Lincolnshire Co-operative prefer to use the 1992 'cloverleaf version' of The Co-operative brand. In May 2016, The Co-operative Group reverted to the use of its 1968 Co-op cloverleaf branding.

In March 2009, The Co-operative Group acquired the Somerfield supermarket retailer for £1.57bn from a group of private equity investors. The Somerfield Head Office in Bristol was subsequently closed and the grocery stores were either sold to rivals or integrated into its own Co-op Food division. In 2016, The Co-operative Group sold 298 smaller convenience stores to McColl's.

The majority of products sold in "Co-op Food" shops are sourced collectively through Federal Retail Trading Services although stocking decisions and pricing are determined by the individual businesses.


### List of UK Co-operatives with food retail operations

Though often considered to be one supermarket business, The Co-operative Food is a network of supermarkets and convenience shops owned and operated by over 15 independent co-operative societies, many of which have adopted the 2008 version of The Co-operative brand. In total there are over 4,000 co-operative food shops in the UK. The table below indicates how many food shops each co-operative society operates.

### Work with Amazon

In 2021, the Co-op started selling food online through Amazon, using robots to deliver groceries. The move was criticised by the GMB union, which has been campaigning for improved worker rights at Amazon.


### Distribution

Co-op Supply Chain Logistics is the distribution business of The Co-operative Group that manages the national and international distribution of goods on behalf of all the food retailing co-operative societies who are members of Co-operative Federal Retail Trading Services. The Co-operative Group manages all of its own warehouses and most of its own transport operations, although several distribution centres use third party logistics partners to manage their transport operations. Supply Chain Logistics Head Office is co-located at the Birtley Distribution Centre.

Co-op Supply Chain Logistics has 9 regional distribution centres (RDCs) and 3 smaller local service centres (LSCs) servicing the outer extremities of the UK. The Coventry-based National Distribution Centre (NDC) supplies all distribution centres with slower moving ambient lines and tobacco.

## Membership

Members of The Co-operative Group and participating regional societies earn one membership point for every £1 spent at The Co-operative Food. Points are converted into dividend at a rate agreed annually by the Board.

In September 2016, The Co-operative Group launched a new membership, decreasing the amount members earn from 5% to 2%, and increasing the amount spent on charity from 1% to 2%.

In July 2024, The Co-operative rebranded their slogan to "Owned By You. Right By You", placing greater emphasis on member ownership.

## Animal welfare

Co-op receives frequent media coverage around animal abuse within its supply chain. In February 2021, undercover footage taken at a salmon supplier for the Co-op showed fish being incorrectly stunned with many killed while fully conscious. The Co-op suspended the supplier.

In July 2021, an investigation into three chicken farms in the Co-op supply chain found birds had died of thirst while carcasses were left to rot among the living. Chickens crammed into "filthy, overcrowded" sheds resorted to cannibalism, and many suffered ammonia burns.

In August 2022, workers were caught abusing ducks at an intensive farm producing eggs for the Co-op. Birds were swung by the necks and bins were filled with dead ducks.

In July 2023, footage emerged showing chickens being crushed to death and run over at a Lincolnshire farm that supplies the Co-op. It also appeared to show the birds struggling with severe injuries, while one can be seen crawling across the floor with broken legs.

In August 2023, chickens were found "collapsing in agony, deformed and dying" at multiple farms supplying the Co-op. The footage captured birds panting from heat and stress, while dirty floors left the birds lying in their own waste.

In December 2023, it was reported that ducks destined for Co-op and other British supermarkets had been swung by the necks and slammed into draws. A video showed workers mistreating animals in an intensive farm.

In February 2024, a BBC investigation found 37% of chickens sold by Co-op had chemical burns caused by ammonia in excrement. They described the situation as "a sign of poorer welfare on farms".
