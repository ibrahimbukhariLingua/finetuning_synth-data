AMI Insurance


# AMI Insurance



**AMI Insurance** began in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1926 as the South Island Motor Union (SIMU), and grew to be the second biggest residential insurer in New Zealand. It was a mutual insurance company, meaning it was owned by its policy holders, until it was bought out by IAG New Zealand in 2011, following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.


## History


### Effect of Canterbury earthquakes

After the Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, there was uncertainty about AMI's financial state, due to doubt over obtaining sufficient reinsurance cover for further earthquakes, plus lack of exact figures from the government's EQC to indicate how much of the earthquakes' insurance costs would have to come from **Allied Mutual Insurance** (AMI). The New Zealand government talked of bailing out the company up to $1,000 million because of the chaos that would ensue if it collapsed. The government eventually agreed to a NZ$500 million support deed. However, large losses led to a $76 million shortfall of its $198.6 million regulatory capital requirement and so forced the controversial sale of AMI to IAG New Zealand, the local arm of Australia and New Zealand's largest insurance company, Insurance Australia Group. IAG NZ had already acquired major insurance names in New Zealand, such as NZI (formerly New Zealand Insurance) and State Insurance, and with acquiring AMI's business (other than Christchurch earthquake-related work) IAG covered 60% of the domestic insurance market.


### Southern Response

The government created a government-owned company, Southern Response Earthquake Services, to take over the part of AMI's work that related to the Christchurch earthquake repairs. It was responsible for settling claims by AMI policyholders for Canterbury earthquake damage that occurred before 5 April 2012. Perceived poor performance of that organisation led to some protests and a lawsuit, but a large percentage of the easier repairs were actioned despite a period of work outstripping resources in post-quake Canterbury.

In 2018 it was revealed that four years earlier Southern Response had employed private investigation company Thompson and Clarke to attend and record public meetings held by groups of AMI/Southern Response claimants. A report by the State Services Commission found that in doing so Southern Response had acted inconsistently with the State Services Code of conduct on a number of occasions in 2014â€“2016.


### 2020 closure of branches

On 23 July 2020, IAG announced that AMI would be closing all of its 53 branches and its remaining State office in New Zealand in phases. The Albany, Botany, Te Rapa, Mount Maunganui, Wellington, Hornby, and Dunedin offices would close in June 2021 while most remaining offices would close on 18 September. The Timaru branch would remain open until 27 November 2020. 65 branch manager jobs would be eliminated while 350 jobs would be transferred to customer service and other departments.
