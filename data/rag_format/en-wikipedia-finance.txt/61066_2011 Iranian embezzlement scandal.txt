# 2011 Iranian embezzlement scandal



The **3,000 billion toman embezzlement scandal in Iran** (also 2,800 billion embezzlement; approximately US$943.5 million)ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ was a corruption scandal involving the use of forged documents to obtain credit from at least seven Iranian state and private banks to purchase recently privatized state-owned companies. The fraud reportedly extended over a four-year period, but became more serious in the months before the scandal broke in September 2011. According to Iranian newspapers, Iranian businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi (also known as Amir-Mansour Aria) masterminded the scam, and as of late October 2011, at least 67 people have been interrogated and 31 of them have been arrested, with Aria being executed in 2014.

Mostafa Pour Mohammadi, the head of a judicial investigations unit, has called the case "the most unprecedented financial corruption case in the history of Iran." The scandal has also been called "politically sensitive", involving Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, a close aide to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, opposed by conservatives.


## Overview

According to Iranian government newspapers and TV channels, the fraud was planned within seven state-owned and private banks, including Saderat Bank of Iran, and is the largest corruption scandal in Iranian history.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The fraud was first identified at Bank Melli, Iran's largest commercial bank.

According to *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post*, the embezzlement was a "scheme to use forged documents or letters of credit to acquire assets, "including major state-owned companies" or "privatized government assets", (such as the Khuzestan Steel Company, a major steel producer) at one of Iran's largest banks, Bank Saderat.

Iranian state prosecutor Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i said 19 people had been arrested for being involved in the embezzlement scandal. *The Washington Post* reports that 22 suspects, "including businessmen and bank officials" have been arrested, and the chiefs of two banks have been dismissed. On 27 September 2011, Mahomud-Reza Khavari abruptly resigned as the managing director of Bank Melli and fled to Canada after the bank was implicated in the fraud. However, a spokesman for the bank stated that Khavari had gone to Canada for "ordinary business reasons". According to the Globe and Mail, Mahmoud Reza Khavari owned a $3 million house in Toronto under his own name, and according to Iran News Update, Khavari allegedly acquired Canadian citizenship in 2005.

The investigation determined that businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi had masterminded the scheme, with his Aria Investment Development Company being the primary recipient of the loans. Khosravi was convicted of embezzlement, money laundering, and bribery. He and three of his closest associates received the death penalty in July 2012. A total of 39 people were convicted of fraud in the case. On 24 May 2014, Khosravi was executed by hanging, while Khavari remains a fugitive. However, Khosravi’s lawyer said that he was made unaware of Khosravi’s execution, according to the IB Times. According to the BBC, the Iranian chief prosecutor said that two other defendants were sentenced to life in prison, whereas 33 more are set to receive prison sentences as high as 35 years.
