# Witan Investment Trust



**Witan Investment Trust plc** was a multi-managed, global equity investment trust. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it merged with Alliance Trust in October 2024.


## History

Witan Investment Trust plc (Witan) was established in 1909 to manage the estate of Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon. First listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1924, it established Henderson Administration (became Henderson Global Investors, now Janus Henderson) to manage its funds in 1932 and then sold its remaining stake in Henderson in 1997. In 2004, Witan became self-managed, appointed its first CEO and adopted a multi-manager approach. Andrew Bell was appointed CEO in 2010. In 2020, Witan became a signatory to the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment.

In June 2024, it was announced that Witan Investment Trust would merge with Alliance Trust to create Alliance Witan. This would be achieved through the voluntary winding up of Witan Investment Trust. Following completion of the transaction, Alliance Trust formally rebranded itself Alliance Witan on 11 October 2024.
