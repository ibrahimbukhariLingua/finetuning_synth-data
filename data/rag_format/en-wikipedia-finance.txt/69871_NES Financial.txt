## Financial Reform Efforts

After the 2007–2008 financial crisis, NES Financial focused its efforts in Washington D.C. Led by CEO Michael Halloran, the company lobbied tirelessly to improved 1031 industry regulations. Despite Halloran's nearly two years worth of efforts, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 did not include additional 1031 regulations.
