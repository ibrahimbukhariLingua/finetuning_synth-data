## History


### 2005-2009: First fund and first investments

Meridiam was established in 2005 by Thierry Déau, formerly Chief Executive of Egis Projects, a subsidiary of France’s Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations specialized in developing, financing and managing infrastructure projects.

Set up to finance public infrastructure and to create a secure investment framework for long-term savings, Meridiam received the financial and operational support from the Crédit Agricole Group and AECOM Technology.

In 2006, while achieving the first closing of its fund Meridiam I, the company secured its first two projects: the Limerick Tunnel in Ireland, which began operating in July 2010, and the A5 highway in Austria, which opened to traffic in January 2010.

In 2007, Meridiam acquired the Fulcrum LIFT project covering local healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom, as part of large-scale program sponsored by the British Health Ministry.

In 2008, the company proceeded to a new fund-raising round for Meridiam I, which brought the fund size to €548 million. In the same year, Meridiam secured a stake in the A2 Motorway phase I project in Poland.

In 2009, the company won four new projects in Europe: the A5 Motorway in Germany, the A2 Motorway phase II in Poland, the R1 Motorway in Slovakia and the velodrome in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France. In the same year, Meridiam also secured two projects in the United States: the port of Miami Tunnel, inaugurated in May 2014 and the North Tarrant Express Highway in Texas, which began operating in October 2014.

Also in 2009, Infrastructure Investor selected Meridiam as European Fund of the Year.


### 2010-2011: Continuation of investments in Europe and North America

In 2011, Meridiam received the Fund of the Year award for its global achievements by Infrastructure Journal.


### 2012-2013: Greater independence

In 2012, Meridiam set up a new supervisory board. The ownership structure was modified and resulted in the majority of shares being held by partners and employees. As of 2013, AECOM maintained thirty percent ownership in Meridiam.

In the same year, the closing of the funds Meridiam Infrastructure Europe II and Meridiam Infrastructure North America II increased the investment capacity of the company to $2.3 billion.

In order to finance the student housing facilities of the University of Hertfordshire (scheduled to open in September 2016), the company launched in 2013 the first project bond without credit enhancement in Europe.

Beginning of September 2021, Meridiam takes a 40% stake in Setrag, the concessionaire which operates "the Transgabonais"(Gabon's main railway line), alongside Comilog (a subsidiary of Eramet and the Gabonese State). Setrag is a vital infrastructure for the country's economy, which connects over approximately 650 km, from Franceville (3rd largest city of the country) to Libreville (capital city), to the port of Owendo.

At the end of September 2021, Meridiam, alongside its partners, Hydrogen de France (HDF) and SARA (limited company of the Antilles refinery, Rubis Group), launches the project for the West Guyana Power Plant (CEOG).
