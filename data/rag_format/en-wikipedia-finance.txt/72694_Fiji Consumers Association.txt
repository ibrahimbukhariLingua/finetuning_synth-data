### Some recent activities

**Fiji Banking Services (2011)** - The association has participated actively in community lobbying for an inquiry into Fiji's banking services sector. It was part of a group of NGOs led by the Consumer Council of Fiji that made a submission to Fiji's competition watchdog, the Fiji Commerce Commission to undertake an inquiry into banking services and the Fiji financial sector in general. The FCA also submitted its written submission on banking services in Fiji.

**Stance on mobile phones health effects** - The association has been lobbying for the Fiji government to address the possible negative health effects of mobile phones. The association has noted that with the deregulation of the industry and competitive retail prices, consumer use of mobile phones Fiji will most likely double in coming years.

**Asserting consumers' rights** - In its News Years 2011 message, the Fiji Consumers Association called on consumers in Fiji "to take a more active role this year by asserting their rights and being vigilant on unscrupulous and dishonest trade practices." The association actively lobbies for consumer empowerment in Fiji in light of the economic changes affecting the small island nation.
