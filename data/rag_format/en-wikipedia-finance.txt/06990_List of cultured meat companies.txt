List of cultured meat companies


# List of cultured meat companies



This is a **list of companies involved in the sale and development of cultured meat**, along with information about them.

Because the commercial production of cultured meat is as of the 2020s still a developing industry, with unprecedented technological challenges and breakthroughs or failures, the progress of pioneers and early start-ups has received much attention in the media and the scientific community. The number of cultured meat companies increased from about 10 start-ups in 2016 to "98 cultured meat companies engaged in culture-related meat production" in December 2022. In addition to these companies, non-profit organisations such as New Harvest, the Good Food Institute, ProVeg International and the Cellular Agriculture Society advocate for, fund and research cultured meat.
