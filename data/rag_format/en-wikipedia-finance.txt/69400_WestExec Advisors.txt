# WestExec Advisors



**WestExec Advisors LLC** is a consulting firm founded in 2017 by Antony Blinken, Mich√®le Flournoy, Sergio Aguirre, and Nitin Chadda, all former Obama administration officials. Lisa Monaco, Robert O. Work, Avril Haines, David S. Cohen, and Jen Psaki have also been WestExec employees. Richard Stengel, former President Obama's Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs is a current employee.

In an interview with *The Intercept*, Flournoy explained WestExec seeks to employ "people recently coming out of government" with "current knowledge, expertise, contacts, networks." The firm and its partners avoid becoming registered lobbyists or foreign agents so that they can (re)enter government service without delays. It does not disclose its clients, whose names are restricted from disclosure by non-disclosure agreements. The firm is named after West Executive Avenue, a street near the West Wing of the White House.
