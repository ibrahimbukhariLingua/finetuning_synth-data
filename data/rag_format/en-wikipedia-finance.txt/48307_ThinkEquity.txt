**ThinkEquity LLC** is a U.S. investment banking firm focusing on performing IPO's, Secondaries, At-the-Market (ATM) programs, selected private placements, PIPEs, Debt Placements and M&A Advisory services.

Previously, ThinkEquity was owned by Peter Donovan and based in San Francisco, California. ThinkEquity was founded in 2001 by Michael T. Moe and Deborah H. Quazzo as a growth focused research-centric investment bank. In April 2007, Panmure Gordon, a London-based investment bank, acquired the firm. After the merger, the US division of the firm used THNK as its underwriter ID but assumed the name ThinkEquity LLC, A Panmure Gordon Company as its company name. On October 17, 2012, the company announced that it was closing its stock-trading business and would transfer its remaining investment-banking unit to another firm. Three weeks later, on November 7, the company filed for Chapter 7 liquidation.

Six years later in April 2018, the company re-emerged as ThinkEquity, a Division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., subsequently merged with Fordham Financial and now “ThinkEquity”.
