## History

Ulta was founded by Richard E. George, the former president of Osco Drug, Inc., and Terry Hanson. George left work at Osco in 1989 to develop a business plan for a retailer that would offer beauty products at different price levels. Other Osco executives joined George and Hanson in the business and raised $11.5 million in venture capital. The company, initially called Ulta3,ʷʰʸ? was launched in 1990, with five stores in Chicago suburbs. The first of these opened at High Point Centre in Lombard, Illinois in early October 1990. The name was changed from Ulta3 to Ulta at the end of 1999.

George left Ulta3 in 1995, and Hanson became the company's chief executive officer.
