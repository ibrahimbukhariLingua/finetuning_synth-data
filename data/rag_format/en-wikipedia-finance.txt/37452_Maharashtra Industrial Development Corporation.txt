After the formation of Maharashtra state on 1 May 1960, the government of Maharashtra constituted a "Board of Industrial Development" (BID) on 1 October 1960, under the chairmanship of Shri. S. G. Barve, I.C.S. The committees recommendations received in the industries department were taken up for implementation. As per the Borkar Committee's recommendations, development of Ulhas Valley Water Supply was entrusted to the Board of Industrial Development (BID). The BID framed the legislation; it was introduced before the state legislation and passed in the form of "Maharashtra Industrial Development Act" which gave birth to MIDC, as a separate corporation on 1 August 1962.

The key historical policy decisions taken by MIDC changed the socioeconomic scenario of the state as its activities spread in the interior. The important policy decision of setting up "independent filtered, potable water supply system of adequate capacity" as essential infrastructure for industrial development was the most intelligent step taken by MIDC in the beginning. It stabilised the population base near the industrial areas. The simultaneously strategic decision taken to provide water supply to nearby population from the capabilities created by MIDC of their own water supply system resulted in phenomenal urban growth in the nearby small towns and villages. The growth of Kalyan complex and Pimpri-Chinchwad are results of this key policy decision taken by MIDC.
