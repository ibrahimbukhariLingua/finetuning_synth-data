# Maxam Explosives



**Maxam Explosives** is one of the largest explosives manufacturers in the world, with its headquarters in Madrid. In Germany, the plants of the former WASAG belongs to Maxam.

The company traces its roots back to the Sociedad Española de la Pólvora Dinamita, founded by Alfred Nobel, which changed its name to Unión Española de Explosivos (UEE) in 1896. In 1970, UEE merged with Río Tinto, creating Unión Explosivos Río Tinto (ERT). ERT is privatised in 1994 and renames itself Maxam in 2006.

In 2018 Advent International sells his 45% to Rhône Capital, the rest, 55%, is still by management.


## Controversies

Maxam continues its operations in Russia despite international calls for companies to exit the Russian market following the invasion of Ukraine. The company maintains two production facilities in Russia, employing approximately 250 staff as of 2021, and contributing around $1 million in taxes to the Russian government.
