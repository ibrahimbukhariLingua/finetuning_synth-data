In 1994 the shares of the B.O.D., which ranked 28th out of 123 banking institutions that existed at the time, are acquired by the BOD HOLDING. In 2000, an expansion process began after the merger of Banco Noroco and Valencia Entidad de Ahorro y Préstamos, which gave way to Norval Bank, an entity that became part of the Grupo Financiero B.O.D.11

When in 2002 the Norval Bank merged with the Banco de Monagas and the Liquid Assets Fund B.O.D., the Western Discount Bank was constituted as Universal Bank, with a network of 143 agencies and a capital of 169 thousand 674 million bolívares.12
