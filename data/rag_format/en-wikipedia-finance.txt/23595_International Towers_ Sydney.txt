The **International Towers** is a commercial skyscraper complex in the Sydney central business district, in the Barangaroo area. The complex comprises three main office towers; **Tower 1** at 217 metres (712 feet), **Tower 2** at 178 metres (584 feet), and **Tower 3** at 168 metres (551 feet). Construction on the towers began in 2013 before completion in mid 2016. The complex was built as part of a major urban redevelopment of Barangaroo, forming part of the core commercial, residential, retail and leisure development at Barangaroo South.

The three office skyscrapers, individually known as International Towers 1, 2 and 3, were designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners.
