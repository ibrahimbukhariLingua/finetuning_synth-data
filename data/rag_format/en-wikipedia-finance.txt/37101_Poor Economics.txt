Poor Economics


# Poor Economics



***Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty*** (2011) is a non-fiction book by Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, both professors of Economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureates. The book reports on the effectiveness of solutions to global poverty using an evidence-based randomized control trial approach. It won the 2011 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.


## Overview

*Poor Economics* lays out a middle ground between purely market-based solutions to global poverty, versus "grand development plans." It rejects broad generalizations and formulaic thinking. Instead, the authors help to understand how the poor really think and make decisions on such matters as education, healthcare, savings, entrepreneurship, and a variety of other issues. They advocate the use of observation, using rigorous randomized controlled testing on five continents, and most importantly by actually listening to what the poor have to say. Often the answers are startling and counter-intuitive, but make the utmost sense when circumstances are understood. In addition, the universal traps of Ignorance, Ideology, and Inertia often stymie policies and institutions, but may be avoided.

From this empirical approach, the authors believe that the best strategies for eradicating poverty can emerge. However, they resist laying out a broad set of conclusions. Instead they draw some simple yet powerful lessons, and believe that small changes can have big effects. The authors conclude on the optimistic note that we are all part of the solution.

## Reception

The book has been well received. Robert Solow commented:

Madeleine Bunting reviewed the book for *The Guardian*, writing:

Nicholas Kristof reviewed the book for *The New York Times*, writing:

Development economist William Easterly reviewed the book for the *Wall Street Journal*, writing:

James Tooley reviewed the parts of the book about education for *Econ Journal Watch*. Although he was critical of the authors' conclusions in those chapters, he generally praised their overall approach:

Sanjay G. Reddy in his 2012 article "Randomise this! On poor economics" in the journal *Review of Agrarian Studies* was more critical of the authors approach than many others. He concludes by arguing as follows:

> It is, perhaps, not too difficult to understand why the prescription of *Poor Economics* has enjoyed as much circulation as it has, in particular among metropolitan development policy-making elites, although increasingly also elsewhere. It appeals to powerful but flawed metropolitan predispositions: a desire to "fix" things with simpleminded mono-causal reasoning, allied with the conviction that technology, through the analysis of data using randomised trials, makes it possible to do so. Its technocratic premises, its naïve view of politics and society, and its unselfconscious do-goodism make for a self-affirming picture of the world.11 It is unfortunate that it does so little to explain it.

He also includes a footnote with the attempt at humour *One can think of at least three interpretations of the title, not all favourable to the authors.*.

*Poor Economics* won the 2011 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.
