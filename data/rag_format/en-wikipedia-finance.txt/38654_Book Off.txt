# Book Off



**Book Off** (ブックオフコーポレーション, *Bukku Ofu Kōporēshon*) (TYO: 3313), stylized as **BOOKOFF**, is Japan's largest chain of used bookstores. Founded in August 1991, the company has had explosive success, expanding to over 850 stores throughout Japan and several overseas locations. In addition to books, its chains also sell manga, CDs, DVDs, video games, and used video game consoles, mobile phones, portable media players, and sports equipment. Stores are distinguished by their large surface area, cleanliness, and bright illumination.


## Operations

Book Off stores are large and browsing is encouraged. Another innovation cited for its success is the practice of shaving the edges off the pages of books using a special machine in order to make them appear newer. By offering a wide selection of books that appear like new at reduced prices, Book Off has aggressively targeted conventional bookstore chains, which since 1953 have been unable to discount new and near-new books and other media due to government regulations which enable a publisher's cartel.

Book Off is frequently cited as a rare example of a corporation that was able to grow during the so-called "lost decade" of economic stagnation that followed the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, through its use of innovative business strategies.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It expanded from merely used books to used second-hand merchandise through its Hard Off stores, and to the video rental market through Tsutaya.


## International stores

Book Off also operates several stores in the United States, two in Seoul and three in Paris. In 2012, it closed its only Canadian store in Vancouver, British Columbia. In the United States there are three stores in New York, ten in California, two in Hawaii, and one in Arizona. There are eight stores in Malaysia operating under the Jalan Jalan Japan brand.
