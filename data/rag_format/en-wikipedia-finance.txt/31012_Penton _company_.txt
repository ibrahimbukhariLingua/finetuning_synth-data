Penton (company)


# Penton (company)



**Penton** was an information services and marketing company. The company's three largest revenue streams came from events, digital and marketing services. Although Penton had a long history (see below) as a trade publisher, in 2015 it reported that 35 percent of its EBITDA derived from digital products, 54 percent from events, and 11 percent from print. The main industry segments served by Penton include agriculture, transportation, natural products/food, infrastructure, and design and manufacturing.

The company was descended from Penton Publishing, founded by John Penton in Cleveland in 1904 to bring together production of several trade magazine titles, including *Foundry*, which he had created in Detroit in 1892. However, after the Penton/Prism merger, the company is now headquartered in New York City, although it continues to maintain offices in Cleveland and other U.S. cities, with an employee base of approximately 1,350 people.

Due to reduced advertising sales as customers shifted to digital media from print, Penton went through "pre-packaged" bankruptcy reorganization in 2010.

On September 15, 2016, it was announced that Penton was to be bought by UK based company Informa for $1.56 billion. The sale closed on November 2, 2016. Penton was integrated into Informa Business Intelligence in 2017.


## Early history

Penton's history began with two Cleveland companies, **Penton Publishing Co.**, founded by John A. Penton—an iron molder by trade—in 1904, and the **Industrial Publishing Co.** John Penton had been involved in publishing trade magazines since 1887, creating *Foundry* in Detroit (1892), and then the Iron and Steel Press Co in Cleveland (1901). In Cleveland, he also published *The Iron Trade Review,* which became *IndustryWeek*.

By the 1920s, the company was a large business magazine publisher, for several years printing "Time" under contract. Between 1938 and 1945, Penton helped the United States Census establish the Standard Industrial Classification system, a digital coding system for industries.

Penton was owned by Pittway from 1976 to 1998.

## Data Solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ

Despite its long history as a trade publisher, in March 2014 Penton moved towards monetizing its large (then 16 million records) database to support marketing campaigns.

As of 2016, the database had grown to some 20 million records.
