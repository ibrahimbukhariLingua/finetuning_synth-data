## History

The HSBC Group has had a presence in Chile since 1981. By 1985 it had three branches, two in Santiago and one in Valpara√≠so. In 1993 HSBC sold its operations to Banco O'Higgins, which was owned by the Luksic Group. In 1997 a merger between Banco O'Higgins and Banco de Santiago created Banco Santiago, one of the largest local banks in Chile and one in which HSBC continues to have a 7% shareholding. The acquisition of the former Republic National Bank of New York returned HSBC to Chile through two full service branches of HSBC Bank USA, in addition to a domestic factoring business.
