New Generation Currency Series


# New Generation Currency Series



The **New Generation Currency (NGC) Series** is the name used to refer to the Philippine peso currency series conceptualized from 2007 to 2010, and banknotes issued since 2010 and coins issued since 2017. The series uses the Myriad and Twentieth Century typefaces.


## History


### 2007–2019: New Generation Currency Project and Demonetization of New Design Series

In 2007, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) began the 12-year demonetization process of the New Design Series when the New Generation Currency (NGC) project was started the formal conceptualization process, which was a meeting of the minds of people with diverse backgrounds and ideas: central bankers, artists, technocrats, historians, communication experts, and currency printers to further enhance security features and to improve durability. The thematic content, designs, and security features underwent thorough deliberations and evaluation, and was undertaken by the BSP’s Numismatic Committee (Num Com) in consultation with the Monetary Board (MB) and, subsequently, with the approval of the BSP Governor and the President of the Philippines.

The members of the numismatic committee included Bangko Sentral Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo and Dr. Ambeth Ocampo, chairman of the National Historical Institute. Designed by Studio 5 Designs and Design Systemat, the new banknotes' designs features famous Filipinos and iconic natural wonders. Philippine national symbols will be depicted on coins. The BSP started releasing the initial batch of new banknotes and design to the public in December 2010, three years after the project and process for NDS demonetization were started. The word used in the bills was "Pilipino" rendered in Baybayin (ᜉᜒᜎᜒᜉᜒᜈᜓ). The font used for lettering in the banknotes is Myriad, while the numerals are set in the Twentieth Century font. The series was approved by Presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her immediate successor Benigno Aquino III, making the only banknote series to be approved by two presidents.

In December 2016, BSP announced that they will launch sets of banknotes bearing President Rodrigo Duterte's signature. The BSP initially released five million pieces of the new 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000-peso bills with Duterte's signature. As for the 200-pesos bills, only two million pieces were released because of lower demand for this denomination.

In 2017, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas updated the design of the P200 and P1000 NGC series banknotes. Also on that same year, BSP introduced the *New Generation Currency Coin Series* which was circulated through banks. The new series features native Philippine flora. Sentimo denominated coins feature a stylized representation of the Philippine flag on the obverse. Peso denominated coins depict the portraits of renowned national heroes of the Philippines on the obverse. The coins are struck in Nickel-plated steel for all six denominations, in response to the widespread hoarding and melting down of the coins, decreasing the cost of production of minting the coins and address concerns of the discoloration of the coins due to the humid, tropical environment. The 10-sentimo coin is not included in this series, because it was removed as a general circulation coin.

In July 2019, the BSP announced plans to replace the ₱20 bill with a ₱20 coin by the 1st quarter of 2020. However, ₱20 bills are still printed in 2020, alongside the enhanced version of the other denominations.

The New Generation Currency series were the only circulating set of notes since August 2, 2019 upon the demonetization of 2,000 and 100,000 peso commemorative banknotes, which completed the 12-year NGC project and demonetization process of NDS/BSP series banknotes.


### 2019–present: Post-NGC project changes and additions

In September 2019, Benjamin Diokno, the current BSP governor, announced that the ₱5 coin, being confused for the ₱1 coin, will have a revised design, featuring a wave edge or scallop shape and enhanced security features. The ₱20 coin received its final designs in the same month and the two coins will be released for circulation in December 2019. The 5-piso coin will have a nonagonal shape. The 20-piso coin will be bimetallic. The 20-piso coin will be the second bimetallic coin in circulation after the 10-piso coin of the *New Design/BSP* series.
In 2020, the BSP released an improved version of the NGC series. In addition to the security features currently present for five denominations (excluding the P20 banknote), the new banknotes will have an updated security thread and design for all five denominations. The notes also have features for the benefit of the visually impaired.

In 2021, the BSP announced that it will test run the issuance of polymer banknotes through a limited issuance of 1,000-peso bills during the first half of 2022, as part of a long-term study to move to polymer notes. The banknotes will be printed by Note Printing Australia (NPA), wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) as result of a government-to-government (G2G) memorandum of understanding between the RBA and the BSP.

In 2021, BSP silently approved the end of production of the 200-peso banknote due to low usage.

In December 2022, BSP announced the new banknotes bearing the signatures of President Bongbong Marcos and BSP Governor Felipe Medalla. The 2020 BSP logo is now also used on 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000-piso (non-polymer version) bills which replaced the 2010 BSP logo that has been in use since the series' release to the public on December 16, 2010.

## Design


### Coins


#### 1 sentimo

#### 5 sentimo

The obverse side of the coin features the description "Republika ng Pilipinas", the three stars and the sun (stylized representation of the Philippine flag), the denomination, year of minting, and mint mark, and the reverse side of the coin depicts the *Hoya pubicalyx* (Kapal-kapal baging), a plant endemic to the Philippines and the current logo of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The composition is nickel-plated steel, has diameter of 16 mm, and mass of 2.2 grams.


#### 25 sentimo

The obverse side of the coin features the description "Republika ng Pilipinas", the three stars and the sun (stylized representation of the Philippine flag), the denomination, year of minting, and mint mark, and the reverse side of the coin depicts the *Dillenia philippinensis* (Katmon), a plant endemic to the Philippines and the current logo of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The composition is nickel-plated steel, has diameter of 20 mm, and mass of 3.6 grams. The size and mass of this coin is the same as the 25 sentimo coin in the BSP Series.


#### 1 piso

The obverse side of the coin features the description "Republika ng Pilipinas", José Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines, the denomination, year of minting, and mint mark, and the reverse side of the coin depicts the *Vanda sanderiana* (Waling-Waling), a plant endemic to the Philippines and the current logo of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The composition is nickel-plated steel, has diameter of 23 mm, and mass of 6 grams.


#### 5 piso

The obverse side of the coin features the description "Republika ng Pilipinas", Andrés Bonifacio, a national hero of the Philippines, the denomination, year of minting, and mint mark, and the reverse side of the coin depicts the *Strongylodon macrobotrys* (Tayabak), a plant endemic to the Philippines and the current logo of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.

Due to the confusion of the 5-piso coin bearing similarities with the 1-piso coin (mainly caused by its similar size), the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has reissued the 5-piso coin in a nonagonal (9-sided shape) into circulation on December 17, 2019.

#### 20 piso

The 20 piso banknote will be changed into a coin that will be released in December 2019 to solve the overuse of this banknote that only takes a year to replace it with a new banknote based on a research by the University of the Philippines. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas states that the new 20 piso coin lasts for 10 to 15 years, longer than a 20 piso banknote. The 20 peso coin was issued into circulation on December 17, 2019. The coin is bi-metallic, with a bronze-plated steel outer ring and a nickel-plated steel center plug, and is the second bi-metallic coin issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, after the 10 peso coin of the *New Design/BSP* series.

One notable feature is the edge inscription, with the initial "BSP" at six angles. This is the fourth edge inscription coin used in the Philippines in common circulation.
