## Scam incident

A namesake app, which was an online scam platform that claims to reward its users daily. Which lured its users into performing daily tasks to earn a commission. However, to be eligible for these tasks, users needed to deposit some 25 USDT in their account, and the app used a Tron (TRC20) Binance wallet address for all their transactions. The app smartly changed its wallet address from time to time.

Later the company also posted on Facebook that there is an ongoing international investment scam using their name and logo and that Fyndiq is in no way associated with these attempted scams.
