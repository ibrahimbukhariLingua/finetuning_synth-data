## Corporate history

Hera was established in 2002 through the first merger of public utilities in the Emilia-Romagna region, which involved 11 companies.

In 2003, Hera started the process of listing on the Milan Stock Exchange, which led the company to be partly privatized with 38.8% of its present share capital in private sectors. After 2003, Hera started to grow. In over five years, the Group merged with other Italian companies operating in distribution of energy, water and gas, such as Agea, Ecosea, Meta, Geat Distribution Gas, and Sat Inc.

Hera also had many long-term contracts with foreign suppliers over the years that followed. In 2006, Hera signed a memorandum of understanding with Enel, Edison and Sonatrach. The memorandum provided for the purchase of one billion cubic meters a year of natural gas transported through the methane pipeline belonging to Galsi, a partner company of Hera.

In July 2008, Hera acquired *Megas Trade*, selling gas and electricity in the Urbino area, owned by *Marche Multiservices*. The transaction formalized the birth of Hera Comm Marche, the commercial branch of the Hera Group for the Marche region, managed by Hera Comm.

On 25 July 2012, approval was given for the merger with Acegas-Aps S.p.A. (Trieste-Padua), which became part of the Hera Group as of 1 January 2013.

On 1 July 2014 AMGA – Azienda Multiservizi S.p.A. merged with Hera Group.
