# FX Productions



**FX Productions, LLC** (**FXP**) is an American television and in-house production company owned by FX Networks, a division of the Disney Entertainment unit of The Walt Disney Company. It was also known in copyright as **Bluebush Productions** from 2007 to 2017. The studio currently produces series for FX, FXX and FX on Hulu. In the past, FXP also produced series for Amazon Prime Video (*One Mississippi*), Epix (*Perpetual Grace, LTD*), Fox (*The Cool Kids* and the first season of *Wayward Pines*), and TBS (*Miracle Workers*), but the studio has since returned its sole focus to the FX channels.


## History

FX Productions was formed in August 2007 to take stakes in FX programming. Eric Schrier was appointed senior vice president of the company and the post of senior vice president of original programming in charge of current series and alternative programming.

In July 2014, Fox Networks Group and DNA Films formed DNA TV Limited joint venture. Fox Networks Group would have first global first rights with co-financing options to the joint venture's shows. DNA TV would be managed by DNA Films management with Eric Schrier, president of Original Programming for FX Networks and FX Productions handling Fox's joint venture interest.

Paul Simms signed an overall television production deal with FXP in October 2017.

In November 2019, it was announced that a number of new series originally ordered for FX produced by FX Productions before the Disney-Fox merger would be carried over to Hulu as part of the move of FX's streaming presence for most of the network's library not already under contract with another streaming provider. The series would remain under the purview of FX Productions, and be marketed under a new Hulu sub-brand, "FX on Hulu". It was planned by the end of 2021 that a third of Hulu's original series input would be produced by FX Productions. More recently, Debra Moore Munoz has struck a deal with FX Productions.
