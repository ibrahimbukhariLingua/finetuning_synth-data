Blockchain-based database


# Blockchain-based database



The **blockchain-based database** is a combination of traditional database and distributed database where data is transacted and recorded via *Database Interface* (also known as *Compute Interface*) supported by multiple-layers of blockchains. The database itself is shared in the form of an encrypted/immutable ledger which makes the information open for everyone.


## Concept

In actual case, the blockchain essentially has no querying abilities when compared to traditional database and with a doubling of nodes, network traffic quadruples with no improvement in throughput, latency, or capacity. To overcome these shortcomings, taking a traditional database and adding blockchain features to it sounds more feasible. That's how the concept of blockchain-based database came into existence, which consists of multiple member clouds riding on two primary layers; the first one is *Database Interface* and the second one is the *Blockchain Anchoring*. The idea behind the blockchain based database concept is to complement the functionality and features of SQL and NoSQL databases with blockchain properties: data immutability, integrity assurance, decentralized control, Byzantine fault tolerance and transaction traceability.


## Implementations

Oracle DBMS implements support for a blockchain-based database model.
