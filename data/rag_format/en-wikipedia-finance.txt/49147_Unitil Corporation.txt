## Background

**History of Unitil**

**1849** Portland Gas Light Company founded in Maine.

**1852** Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company is organized to illuminate gas streetlights in downtown Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

**1901** Concord Electric Company is founded.

Unitil Corporation is incorporated as a public utility holding company, with utility operating subsidiaries Concord Electric Company and Exeter & Hampton Electric Company. Unitil Service Corp. is founded to provide joint administrative services for Unitil's subsidiary companies.

**1992** Unitil merges with Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, and Fitchburg remains as one of Unitil's operating utility companies.

**1993** Unitil founds Unitil Resources, Inc. as a non-utility subsidiary. Its affiliate, Usource LLC., provides energy brokerage services to large energy users throughout the northeast seeking competitive electricity or natural gas supply.

**2002** Concord Electric Company and Exeter & Hampton Electric Company merge, and Unitil Energy Systems is the new name of the combined companies.

The company generates revenue mainly distributing utility to customers through operating the underground transmission pipeline and providing energy consulting services and real estate services. In 2013, the revenue of the gas operation is $170.4 million, accounting for 46% of the total operation revenue, and the electricity operation revenue, $190.7 million, represents 52% of the total revenue.

The company has four segments, three wholly owned distribution utilities and five subsidiaries, providing utilities and relevant advice and management service to customers. The three distribution utilities are Unitil Energy Systems, Inc., Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company and Northern Utilities, Inc.

The cold weather made more and more people switch to the service of Unitil, which resulted in a gas sale increase, so the company has planned to invest $570 million to expand its distribution infrastructure to serve a larger number of customers.

In winter 2014, the company has asked for a price increase to part of its customers in Greater Portland and the Lewiston-Auburn because of the high demand and harsh weather. The Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) approved its price increase but cut its request by one-third.
