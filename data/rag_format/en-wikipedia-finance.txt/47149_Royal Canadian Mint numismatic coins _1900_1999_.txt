Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (1900–1999)


# Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (1900–1999)



One of the most profitable aspects of the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) is its numismatic product line. The first numismatic coin from the RCM was arguably the 1935 dollar commemorating the Silver Jubilee of King George V. Though intended for circulation, it was the first Canadian coin commemorating an event. The decision to issue this coin was made in October 1934 by Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. There were economic and patriotic motivations for the release of a silver dollar, including a hope to boost the silver mining industry. In future years, the silver dollar would have a more emotional meaning for many Canadians because it was also the first coin to have the Voyageur motif on its reverse.


## Birth of luxury coins

Expansion in the numismatic line was a key element of the 1990s. The first significant sign was the creation of the two-hundred dollar gold coin. Starting in 1990, this coin was sold for a higher price than its face value. The first coin commemorated the Silver Jubilee of Canada's flag and sold for $395.00. The superstar of this collection would be the Canadian Native Cultures and Traditions coins. These coins were minted from 1997 to 2000. The Haida coin has been an award-winning coin for the RCM, taking the Best Coin Award at the 1997 Singapore International Coin Show.

The advent of the two-hundred dollar gold series was quickly joined by a platinum series. These high-quality collector coins solidified the RCM's entry into the luxury coin market. A four-coin set with face values of $30, $75, $150, and $300 respectively were complemented by the high-quality artwork that adorned these luxury items. Notable artists such as Robert Bateman and Glen Loates contributed to these collections with polar bear and bird designs. The issue price for these collections was around $1,990 and the casing was a walnut or burgundy (for 1994) case with a black suede four-hole insert and a certificate of authenticity.
