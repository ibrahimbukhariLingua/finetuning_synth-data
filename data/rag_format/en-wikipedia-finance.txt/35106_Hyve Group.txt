The business was founded by the Shashoua family as "International Trade Exhibitions" (ITE) in 1991 and then launched a series of trade events in the new market economies of Russia and the CIS. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1998. In 2008 it acquired Primexpo NW LLC, a conference organiser based in St Petersburg and has subsequently acquired further businesses in Moscow (MVK), Krasnodar (Krasnodar LLC), Istanbul (YEMF and Platform Exhibitions), Kyiv (Autoexpo and Beautex), Mumbai (ABEC) and Kuala Lumpur (Trade Link).

The company rebranded from ITE Group to Hyve Group in September 2019.

In December 2019, Hyve acquired two US-based events: Shoptalk and Groceryshop.

On 15 March 2023, Hyve and Providence Equity's acquisition vehicle Heron UK Bidco Limited announced they had agreed the terms of a recommended cash offer to be made by Heron for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Hyve.
