## History


### Artisoft

Tucson, Arizona-based **Artisoft** was the first company to offer peer-to-peer networking. The name of its network operating system was LANtastic.

In 1996 the company acquired **Stylus Innovation** for $12.8 million. *Stylus Innovation*, noted for its Barcode-based remote shopping product, was founded in 1991 by Krisztina 'Z' Holly, Mike Cassidy and John Barrus.

*Stylus Innovation* came to public attention by winning the *Grand-Prize* in the 1991 MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition.


### Legacy

Artisoft bought TeleVantage, and renamed the latter Artisoft TeleVantage. However, with Microsoft's Windows for Workgroups "eating into" LANtastic's lead (as was Novell). and then free "bundled networking software" in Windows 95 and 98, the company "saw the handwriting on the wall."

LANtastic's originator, Artisoft Televantage, sold "Legacy" technology ("LANtastic") to Spartacom Technologies in 2000. The latter, which subsequently was acquired by PC Micro, continued to market and maintain LANtastic. Version 8.01, released in 2006, can network PCs running MS-DOS (also PC DOS) 5.0 or later and Windows 3.x up to 7.


### Vertical redirect

In September 2004 Artisoft, minus its former LANtastic technology, purchased Vertical and, effective January 2005, renamed itself
Vertical Communications Inc.

Vertical now had two non-competing main products, Televantage (for firms with under 1,000 phones and "one or more locations" and Vertical's "own" InstantOffice, "a Voice-over-IP phone system ... for large enterprises with many locations."
