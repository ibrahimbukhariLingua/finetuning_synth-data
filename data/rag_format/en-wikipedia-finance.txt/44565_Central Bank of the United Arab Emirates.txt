Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates


# Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates



The **Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates** (Arabic: مصرف الإمارات العربية المتحدة المركزي) (**Central Bank of the UAE** or **CBUAE**) is the state institution responsible for managing the currency, monetary policy, banking and insurance regulation in the United Arab Emirates.


## History

The predecessor of the central bank was the Currency Board which was established on 19 May 1973. This followed the creation of the UAE as an independent state in 1971. The original purpose of the UAE Currency Board was to issue an independent currency for the new state to replace the existing currencies in use: the Qatari riyal and the Bahraini Dinar. The new UAE dirham entered circulation on the same day the Currency Board was established.

At this time, the Currency Board of the UAE did not have full central bank powers. It was mandated to manage the currency and the country's gold and foreign exchange reserves, but did not have regulatory authority and was not empowered to manage the UAE's monetary policy. The Union Law No (10) of 1980 saw the establishment of the Central Bank of the UAE as a public institution. The Law No (10) also augmented the functions of the Central Bank (previously assigned to the Currency Board) – Abdul Malik Yousef Al Hamar appointed Governor. Decretal Federal Law No. (14) of 2018 regarding the Central Bank & Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities issued.

The Central Bank of the UAE has powers to issue and manage the currency; to ensure the stability of the currency; to manage the UAE's credit policy; to develop and oversee the banking system in the UAE; to act as the Government's banker; to provide monetary and financial support to the Government; to manage the UAE's gold and currency reserves; to act as the lender of last resort to banks operating in the UAE; and to represent the UAE in international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Arab Monetary Fund.
