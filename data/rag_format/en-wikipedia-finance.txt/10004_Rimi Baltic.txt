* **Rimi Hyper** – hypermarkets
* **Rimi Super** – supermarkets

## History and ownership

The retail operator history begins with the opening of the first retail in Latvia, the Dole shopping center, in February 20, 1997.

Rimi Baltic was created in 2004 when Finnish Kesko and Swedish ICA agreed to merge their operations in the Baltic states in a 50/50 joint venture. Rimi Baltic officially began operations on 1 January 2005.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Kesko previously had 6 K-Citymarket hypermarkets and 45 Säästumarketᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ discount food stores in Estonia and 5 K-Citymarkets in Latvia and 19 Supernetto discount outlets in Latvia. ICA previously owned 33 Rimi stores (supermarkets and compact hypermarkets) across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Following the merger, all the K-Citymarket stores were progressively converted to Rimi hypermarkets during 2005.

Towards the end of 2006, Kesko decided to pull out of the joint venture and sold all of its shares in Rimi Baltic to ICA. Rimi Baltic became a wholly owned subsidiary of ICA AB from 1 January 2007. Property deals relating to Kesko's ownership of the former Citymarket sites were completed a few days later.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On December 23, 2016, ICA Gruppen concluded an agreement on the purchase of the Lithuanian company UAB Palink for EUR 213 million.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Palink managed the second-largest food retail network, IKI in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Competition Council authorized this acquisition in October 2017 on the condition that 17 Rimi and Iki stores in Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipeda and Panevezys will be sold to third parties. In mid-March 2018, Rimi Lietuva submitted nominations of potential buyers to the Competition Council. The council did not support them on the grounds that these buyers "would not provide stable and at least as effective competition" as the current company until the deal is implemented. In April, the Competition Council announced that the sale of Iki to Rimi was terminated.


## Rimi in other countries

The Rimi name could also be found in Norway where it originated when founder Stein Erik Hagen rebranded a store. It has been used on ICA's discount food stores there, but were later operating under the name Coop Norway (the Rimi stores were rebranded to Coop Extra). Stein Erik Hagen sold most of his shares to ICA over a period of time. It has previously been used in Sweden by ICA and in Finland by Kesko, although these stores have since been converted to other formats.
