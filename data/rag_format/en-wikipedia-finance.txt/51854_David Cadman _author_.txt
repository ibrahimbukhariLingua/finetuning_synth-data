## Contributions


### Economics and real estate research

Cadman coauthored a successful textbook on property development in the 1970s (Cadman and Austin-Crowe, 1978), and several other key texts on risk and management of commercial real estate projects, particularly while working part-time at the University of Reading and University of Cambridge. His textbook is still in print in the late 2010s under different authorship.

Property Market Analysis (PMA) was established to advise commercial investors on property markets. PMA clients included investment banks, pension funds, and commercial developers and it became a successful international operation. It still provides international property market forecasts. Cadman and Barras set up a PMA subscription service, PROMIS, that still provides regularly updated information on most UK and some global urban markets, currently on 300 towns and cities. Cadman stepped away in the 2000s to other consultancy work and to writing and reflecting on questions of spirituality and sustainability.


### Spirituality

On retiring from the world of property consultancy, Cadman became more interested in philosophy and the "place of love" from which Quaker testimonies spring, and how to enact these in everyday life. He has edited several volumes on this theme. His publications include: 'Why Love Matters' co-edited with Scherto Gill and published by Peter Lang (2016); 'Peacefulness' also co-edited with Scherto Gill and published by Spirit of Humanity Press (2017); and 'Love and the Divine Feminine' published by Panacea Press (2020)

He has worked with the Temenos Academy, an educational charity offering education in philosophy and the arts spanning the sacred traditions of East and West. Cadman has also edited three volumes of the Prince's speeches (published in 2014 and 2019). He was chairman of what is now known as The Prince’s Foundation and was a Trustee of The Prince’s School of Traditional Arts.

Among several advisory positions on peace and harmony, Cadman was involved in establishing the inter-faith Spirit of Humanity Forum in 2010, which held its first meeting in Rekyavik in 2012 (as a counter to the World Economic Forum in Davos) and now meets every two years. Its goals are to "bring together leaders and practitioners who hold the view that the positive energy of love is the deepest, most enduring and most valuable characteristic of human nature. The aim of the Forum is to identify and share ways of improving access to this inner strength of being. It showcases practical examples of how love, compassion and a care for others can transform and truly re-humanise an organisation."

Under the pen name of William Blyghton, he has published The Suffolk Trilogy, three novels:'The House by the Marsh' (2017), 'Abraham Soar' (2018) and 'Noah: An Old Fool' (2019) These novels explore aspects of love, loss and living in the later years of life.
