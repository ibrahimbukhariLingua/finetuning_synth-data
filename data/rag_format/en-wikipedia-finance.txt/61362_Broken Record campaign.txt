Broken Record campaign


# Broken Record campaign



**The Broken Record campaign** is a campaign expressing music creators’ discontent with the streaming business model and asking for fairer remuneration. The campaign was created by Tom Gray, a musician and part of the rock band, Gomez, in April 2020.

The campaign sought UK government regulation of the music industry and improved rights for music creators under UK Copyright Law. The campaign also sought the shift of business model from the current use of “pro-rata” or “revenue share” model to a user-centric model.

In July 2021, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published a report recommending alterations to the streaming business model, while in January 2022, the Competition & Markets Authority announced a study into the music streaming market.


## Overview

During the COVID-19 pandemic, musicians could not perform live shows and had to rely on income from music streaming. As per the current system of streaming services, artists receive around 16% of the total income from streams, while the record companies take approximately 41% and streaming services takes an average of 29%.

In April 2020, Tom Gray first used the hashtag, #BrokenRecord on Twitter commenting on the state of the modern music industry. The hashtag was used by other music creators to voice their own dissatisfaction. In May 2020, the campaign hosted a Twitter listening party featuring Boy George, The Shins, KT Tunstall and John Grant. The campaign also received support from the Musicians' Union and The Ivors Academy.

In October 2020, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, announced an inquiry into the ‘Economics of Streaming’. The inquiry received evidence from more than 300 artists’ including oral evidence from Nile Rodgers, Ed O'Brien, Guy Garvey, Nadine Shah and organizations including Sony Music, Warner Music, Universal Music, Spotify, Amazon, Apple and YouTube.

In April 2021, the campaign wrote to the then British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, calling for improved rights and remuneration for music creators and a referral of the industry to the UK Competition & Markets Authority. The letter was co-signed by Paul McCartney, Kate Bush, The Rolling Stones, Chris Martin and over 200 other notable people in the British music industry.
