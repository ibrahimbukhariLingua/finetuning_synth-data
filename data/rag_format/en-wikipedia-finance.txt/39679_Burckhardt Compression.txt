**Burckhardt Compression AG** is a Winterthur-based Swiss firm specialising in reciprocating compressors. According to the enterprise, it is the world leader in this field, with its products being used around the world in various industrial applications.

The company was founded by Franz Burckhardt as a small mechanical workshop in Basel in 1844, which he expanded to a factory making air and vacuum pumps. The firm was taken over by Sulzer in 1969 and became independent again in 2002 after a management buyout.

In May 2006, Burckhardt Compression announced its intention to go public on the Swiss stock exchange, probably in June 2006.


## Business Areas

Burckhardt Compression specialises in the manufacture of labyrinth piston compressors, process gas compressors, hyper compressors, and fuel gas compressors. It is the only company globally that produces all four types of these compressors, which are used in industries such as chemical, petrochemical, refinery, gas transport and storage, hydrogen mobility and energy, industrial gas, and gas extraction and processing. These compressors are essential for compressing, cooling, or liquefying gases like hydrocarbon gases or industrial gases.

The company operates in two main divisions:

- **Systems Division:** This division focuses on the development, manufacture, and sale of compressor systems and equipment tailored to meet specific customer requirements.

- **Services Division:** This division provides a wide range of services to enhance the performance and reliability of compressors throughout their service life. Services include maintenance, repairs, overhauls, spare parts, and customer training.


## History

Burckhardt Compression, formerly known as *Maschinenfabrik Burckhardt*, was founded in Basel in 1844, as a mechanical workshop by Franz Burckhardt. The company specialised in compressors and vacuum pumps from 1878, under the direction of Burckhardt's son, August Burckhardt. Early compressors from 1913 reportedly delivered 4350 psig (300 bar), increasing to 58,000 psig (4000 bar) by 1948 through the development of high-pressure technology.

In 1969, *Maschinenfabrik Burckhardt* became part of Sulzer AG, at which point a second production plant was opened in Winterthur. In 2000, all business activities were combined in Winterthur - the Basel site was closed and in 2001, the headquarters were relocated to Winterthur.

Following a management buyout in June 2002, the company was renamed *Burckhardt Compression AG*, and a holding structure was put in place, under the name *Burckhardt Compression Holding AG*. In June 2006, an initial public offering (IPO) (VTX:BCHN) took place.

In December 2015, Burckhardt Compression acquired a 40% stake in Houston-based *Arkos Field Services*, a provider of gas compression services and components. which was increased to 60% in November 2019 as company gains increased access to the American market.

In March 2016, the company acquired a majority stake in *Shenyang Yuanda Compressor*, a leading Chinese manufacturer of reciprocating compressors, thereby gaining local market proximity and expanding the portfolio to cover different market needs.

In September 2016, the company acquired *IKS Industrie- und Kompressorenservice GmbH* based in Bremen and in June 2017 Burckhardt Compression strengthened its presence in Canada through the acquisition of *CSM Compressor Supplies & Machine Work Ltd* based in Edmonton and Drumheller, Alberta.

In March 2020, the company acquired the global compressor business from *The Japan Steel Works*. In December 2021, the company expanded its service business in the maritime and petrochemical industries by acquiring 100% shares in Mark van Schaick BV, based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

In 2023, Burckhardt Compression fully acquired Arkos Field Services and integrated it into its operations, aiming to better serve customers and achieve ambitious growth targets. In April of the same year, the company acquired Thailand-based *SPAN Maintenance and Service Co. Ltd*. and established Burckhardt Compression (Thailand) Co. Ltd. through this acquisition. The acquisition of the Thai-based Burckhardt-authorised service partner increased the company position in Southeast Asia and included taking over two dozen employees.
