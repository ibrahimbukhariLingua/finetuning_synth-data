*Forbes Corporate Warrior* received negative reviews upon release. Richard Longhurst of the Polish edition of *PC Gamer* wrote "the idea might not be so stupid if it were implemented sensibly", but faulted its "empty" spaces, "poor" graphics and design, and lack of humour. *The Times* described the game as a "turkey" and an "impossible marriage of two gaming styles", citing its "shaky first-person perspective". In a retrospective review for *PC Gamer*, Richard Cobbett described the game as "one of the worst shooters ever made", expressing confusion and incredulity at the game's concept and use of economic metaphors.
