# Lucidchart



**Lucidchart** is a web-based diagramming application that allows users to visually collaborate on drawing, revising and sharing charts and diagrams, and improve processes, systems, and organizational structures. It is produced by Lucid Software Inc., based in Utah, United States and co-founded by Ben Dilts and Karl Sun.


## History

In January 2011, Lucid Software Inc. was incorporated in Delaware through the conversion of Lucidchart, LLC, a Utah limited liability company formed in April 2009. In 2010, Lucid announced that it had integrated Lucidchart into the Google Apps Marketplace.

In 2011, Lucid raised $1 million in seed funding from 500 Startups, 2M Companies, K9 Ventures, and several angel investors.

On October 17, 2018, Lucid announced it had raised an additional $72 million from Meritech Capital, Spectrum Equity and ICONIQ Capital.

In 2020, Lucid launched a digital whiteboarding capability called Lucidspark.

In 2021, Lucid launched a digital cloud visualization capability called Lucidscale.


## Features

Lucidchart is entirely browser-based, running on browsers that support HTML5. This means it does not require plugins or updates of a third-party software like Adobe Flash. The platform supports real-time collaboration, allowing all users to work simultaneously on projects and see each user’s additions reflected in real time. All data is encrypted and stored in secure data centers.

Additional features include:

* A drag-and-drop interface
* Real-time co-authoring, shape-specific comments, and collaborative cursors
* Data linking
* Auto-visualization to generate org charts and ERDs
* SQL import and export capabilities

Lucidchart also supports importing files from draw.io, Gliffy, OmniGraffle, and Microsoft Visio. The platform is integrated with Google Workspace and Drive, Microsoft Teams and other Office products, Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Salesforce, GitHub, Slack, and others.
