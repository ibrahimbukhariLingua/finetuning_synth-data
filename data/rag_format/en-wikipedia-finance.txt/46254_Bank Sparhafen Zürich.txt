## History

In 1850 the company was founded as an association and converted to a cooperative in 1906.

In 1977 it bought several multi-family houses and entered the real estate business, subsequently built via further purchases. To divide the bank business and real estate activities, a new organization was founded in 2004. The former cooperative bank *Sparhafen Zürich* was converted to the roofing company *BSZ Genossenschaft*. The existing banking was incorporated to the new subsidiary *Bank Sparhafen Zürich*, and the properties management was transferred to the subsidiary *BSZ Immobilien AG*.

In 2009 the bank was included to the RBA-Holding AG, where it belongs to the subgroup of client banks.
