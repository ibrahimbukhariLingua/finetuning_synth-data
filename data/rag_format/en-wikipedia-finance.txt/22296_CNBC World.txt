CNBC World


# CNBC World



**CNBC World** is an American pay television business news channel operated by the NBCUniversal News Group which provides coverage of world markets alongside the domestic CNBC service, using programmes from CNBC's international networks based in Europe, Asia, India, and other regions served by a domestic CNBC channel or affiliate. Effectively, this makes the network's prime time timeslot the graveyard slot, due to time zone differences, when it simulcasts live programming from their overseas sister networks.

During U.S. trading hours covered by the main CNBC network, pre-taped shows from CNBC's different international channels (e.g. CNBC-TV18 and CNBC Indonesia) are seen on the channel, along with CNBC Prime reality programming such as *American Greed* and other CNBC specials are shown. This is done to force viewers to tune in to the main CNBC service for business information outside the Eurasian market days.

As of 2024, the network is not offered in high definition by most providers, and the only way to watch CNBC's international networks in that format in the United States is through the premium monthly/yearly streaming service, "CNBC Pro", as most providers offer it only as a standard definition offering.

Before 2001, CNBC Asia's coverage was seen on American cable via the International Channel, both before and after that network's merger with Asia Business News.
