Allco Finance Group


# Allco Finance Group



**Allco Financial Group** was a fully integrated global financial services business, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and headquartered in Sydney. Major services provided were structured asset finance, funds management and debt and equity funding. At one stage before liquidation, Allco had over A$4.3 billion in assets, and had financed over A$60 billion of transactions. In its most visible public transaction Allco was a part of Airline Partners Australia, the consortium that unsuccessfully attempted to buy Qantas. The company is now in liquidation, after previously being in administrative receivership, following difficulties in refinancing debt and a share price fall of 99% since the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis.


## History

Allco Financial Group was founded in 1979 by David Coe, a former partner of Sydney law firm Mallesons Stephen Jaques to originate and arrange structured finance transactions for aircraft, ships and rolling stock. Over the years, Allco grew to provide funding for other services, including infrastructure and commercial finance. Allco operated globally and employed over 500 people.

Allco listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2006 after merging with Record Investments, which was set up by Allco as its listed investment vehicle in 2001. At the time of listing, the merged entity was valued at A$3billion. Mr Tim Dodd, previously CFO of the BT Financial Group was appointed as chief financial officer in 2006 and former Westpac senior executive David Clarke as the new CEO. Ray Fleming took over the CFO role in June 2008 after Tim Dodd's departure.

In December 2006, Allco, along with several other firms, formed the Airline Partners Australia consortium as a bidding vehicle to Qantas although the deal failed in May 2007.

In December 2007 Allco led the acquisition by Australian investors of a series of power plants in the U.S. Northeast from Consolidated Edison, owner of New York City's electric utility, for US$1.48 billion.


## Sub-prime crisis

Fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis caused major problems for the company, prompting investor concerns about rising debt levels and causing Allco to refocus its operating model to within business sectors it knew well. Chairman David Coe and two other directors, Gordon Fell and David Turnbull, resigned from the board in March 2008.

Banks seized 14% of the company's shares after it defaulted on margin loans. The company went into voluntary administration on 4 November 2008, at the request of its directors.
Major news agencies ran the details of the first major victim of the credit crisis in tandem with the fall of ABC Learning the following day.

David Coe died of a suspected heart attack in Aspen, Colorado, US, 21 January 2013.
