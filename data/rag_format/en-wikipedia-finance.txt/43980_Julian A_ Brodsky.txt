# Julian A. Brodsky



**Julian A. Brodsky** (born July 16, 1933) is an American businessman, the co-founder of Comcast Corporation and served as its chief financial officer and vice chairman. He also served as co-founder and chair of Comcast Interactive Capital, Comcast's venture capital unit now called Comcast Ventures.


## Early life and education

Brodsky was raised in a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He served two years in the United States Army before training as an accountant.


## Career

In 1963, Brodsky joined one of his clients, Ralph J. Roberts, and Roberts's adviser, Daniel Aaron, to purchase a 1,200-subscriber cable TV operator in Tupelo, Mississippi called American Cable Systems. They incorporated in 1969 as Comcast Corporation, a name Roberts invented by combining the words *communications* and *broadcasting*. The partners became a powerful leadership team with a style described as a threesome driving a car with Brodsky stepping on the gas by raising the necessary capital for growth, Aaron with his foot on the brakes to ensure effective operations, and Roberts with his hands on the steering wheel as CEO.
