**Chengdu Airlines** is an airline headquartered in Shuangliu, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

## History

Originally named **United Eagle Airlines Co., Ltd** (鹰联航空公司; also known as **UEAir**), the company was founded in 2004 by a former executive of China Northwest Airlines, with the necessary funding being provided by the Vickers Financial Group. It took delivery of its first airliner, an Airbus A320 that previously had belonged to Air Jamaica, on 8 July 2005ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and on 27 July, revenue flights were commenced. Another similar aircraft type, the slightly smaller Airbus A319, was put in service with United Eagle Airlines on 2 December of that year.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In March 2009, Sichuan Airlines invested 200 million RMB (30 million USD) in United Eagle Airlines, thus holding 76 percent of the shares. In late 2009, these shares were sold to Chinese aircraft manufacturer Comac and to *Chengdu Communications Investment Group*. Following this ownership change, United Eagle Airlines placed a firm order for 30 Comac ARJ21s, the first of which initially was planned to be delivered in late 2010.

On 23 January 2010, the airline was renamed **Chengdu Airlines**.
