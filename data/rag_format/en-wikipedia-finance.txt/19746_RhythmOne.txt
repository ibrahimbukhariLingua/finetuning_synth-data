### All Media Network

All Media Network (AMN), formerly known as All Media Guide (AMG) and AllRovi, was an American company that owned and maintained AllMusic, AllMovie, AllGame (until its closure in 2014), SideReel and Celebified.

The company was founded in 1990 by popular-culture archivist Michael Erlewine. All Media Network offices were located in San Francisco, Ann Arbor, and other locations in the United States.

All Media Network was founded in Big Rapids, Michigan in 1990 by Michael Erlewine. With the All Music Guide the aim was to "[compile] discographic information on every artist who's made a record since Enrico Caruso gave the industry its first big boost", which launched in 1991.

All Music Guide (now AllMusic) was launched in 1991. In 1994, the All Movie Guide (now AllMovie) was launched and in 1998 the All Game Guide (later AllGameâ€”defunct in 2014).

They expanded with the All Movie Guide (now AllMovie) in 1994, and then the All Game Guide (now AllGame) in 1998. They moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1999 to take advantage of the "rich talent pool". AMG was a business unit within Alliance Entertainment from 1996 until early 2005. In 2006, AEC One Stop Group, Inc., was its parent company.

Alliance was acquired in 1999 by Yucaipa Companies, a multibillion-dollar fund based in California.

Macrovision (now TiVo) announced on November 6, 2007 that it had agreed to purchase All Media Guide for a reported $102 million; $72 million in cash was paid up front, and $30 million in contingent payments were made one year later. For a time, all of the guides were controlled by Rovi's nameservers and combined access to the All Music and All Movie Guides was provided via AllRovi.com from 2011 until 2013. In 2013, Rovi sold consumer access of the content to the newly established All Media Network, LLC, but retained control of licensing the content to other businesses. The overall website is allmedianetwork.com (previously allmediaguide.com and allrovi.com).

Rovi sold the consumer access to them to newly established All Media Network, LLC in 2013, while retaining ownership and maintenance of the content itself.

The AllGame section of the site was shut down on December 12, 2014.

On April 16, 2015 Blinkx Plc acquired All Media Network and rebranded the website under the new unified RhythmOne Group banner. In 2019 the company was acquired for $174M by Taptica, which in 2023 rebranded as Nexxen.


## Properties


### AllMusic

AllMusic is an online database which provides access to information about songs, albums, musicians, bands, and musical styles alongside staff-authored news, reviews, biographies, ratings and recommendations. Initially published in book form in 1991 as the *All Music Guide*, the content is now freely available to the public for online reference and information as well as available via licensing for point-of-sale systems, media players, and online music stores.


#### Guide series

RhythmOne also produces the AllMusic guide series that includes the All Music Guide to Jazz and the All Music Guide to the Blues. Vladimir Bogdanov is the president of the series.


### AllMovie

AllMovie, launched in 1994 as the All Movie Guide, provides access to information about actors, films, and filmmakers with staff-authored news, reviews, ratings, and recommendations. It offers limited information about Television productions, focused mainly on those released on DVD. Like AllMusic, the content is also available via licensing to point-of-sale systems, media players, and online stores.


### AllGame

AllGame, active between 1998 and 2014 as the All Game Guide, offered information and reviews about many console, handheld, arcade, and PC games released in the US. The site started in February 1998 with the goal of becoming the most comprehensive game database available. In a farewell message on their site, the staff noted that they "didn't all know exactly what we were doing in those early days but it was an exciting time to be helping build an online game database before the Internet exploded with numerous websites dedicated to video games."


### SideReel

SideReel, launched in 2007, is a TV community site which provides information about TV shows and episodes.


### Celebified

Celebified offers celebrity news and interviews and started in 2012. As of December 2023, all prior existing URLs now return a 404 error. The homepage of Celebified.com now only exists as a feed of posts from other network websites.


## Operations


### Business model

The AllMusic database is also used by several generations of Windows Media Player and Musicmatch Jukebox to identify and organize music collections. Windows Media Player 11 and the integrated MTV Urge music store have expanded the use of AllMusic data to include related artists, biographies, reviews, playlists and other data.

All Media Network licenses large databases of metadata about movies, video games, audio books, and music releases from Rovi Corporation and publishes them online for consumer use. This includes credits, and staff-written biographies, reviews, ratings, and recommendations as well as categories such as theme or mood. Rovi also makes this content available for point of sale systems in stores globally, for CD and DVD recognition in software media players such as Windows Media Player and Musicmatch Jukebox, and for providing content for a variety of websites including iTunes, Pandora, and Spotify.

Formerly, All Media Guide sold print compilations of its information. RhythmOne's database was initially set up by Vladimir Bogdanov.

Information in the database is licensed and used in point-of-sale systems by some music retailers, includes the following:

* Basic data: names, genres, credits, copyright information, product numbers.
* Descriptive content: styles, tones, moods, themes, nationalities.
* Relational content: similar artists and albums, influences.
* Editorial content: biographies, reviews, rankings.

## Adware controversy

A lengthy criticism of Blinkx by Harvard Business School Associate Professor Ben Edelman, published in January 2014, sought to prove that Blinkx continued the adware operations of two companies it acquired, Prime Visibility Media Group and Zango, and was defrauding advertisers. Blinkx responded point-by-point in March 2014, saying that it did not install adware without user consent and that they did not wholly acquire Zango or its assets. An earlier, 2009 blog post by Ken Smith, Zango co-founder and former CTO, supported Edelman's assertion that Blinkx acquired all of Zango's assets.

Forbes contributor Peter Cohan claimed that Edelman's post caused a massive drop in Blinkx's stock price, and further noted that Blinkx's initial, now-deleted corporate response on 30 January 2014 was largely an attack on Edelman's methods, rather than on the content of his analysis. However, New York Times blogger Mark Scott theorized that Edelman's undisclosed client(s), who funded his research on Blinkx, may have been hedge funds who profited from shorting the drop in Blinkx's stock price.

Edelman published further research in April 2014, claiming that Blinkx offered users deceptive software installers and used deceptive pop-up advertisements. He continued to defend his claim that Blinkx purchased all of Zango's assets, including its physical headquarters, and argued that a Federal Trade Commission order against Zango in 2007 may still apply to Blinkx. A section of the post co-authored with digital fraud investigation consultant Wesley Brandi also defended and furthered his initial claims that Blinkx was defrauding its advertising affiliates.
