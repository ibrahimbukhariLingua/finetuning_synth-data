# Trivest



**Trivest Partners, L.P.** is among the oldest private equity firms in the Southeast U.S., founded in 1981, and focuses exclusively on founder and family-owned businesses. Trivest is headquartered in Miami, Florida with regional offices in Charlotte, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, New York and Toronto.
