Customs declaration


# Customs declaration



A **customs declaration** is a form that lists the details of goods that are being imported or exported when a citizen or visitor enters a customs territory (country's borders). Most countries require travellers to complete a customs declaration form when bringing notified goods (alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, animals, fresh food, plant material, seeds, soils, meats, and animal products) across international borders. Posting items via international mail also requires the sending party to complete a customs declaration form.

The declaration form helps the customs to control goods entering the country, which can affect the country's economy, security or environment. A levy duty may be applied.

Travellers have to declare everything they acquired abroad and possibly pay customs duty tax on goods. Some countries offer a duty-free allowance of certain products which may not need to be declared explicitly.


## Types of forms

* When an individual is transporting the goods, the form is called a customs arrival card, or a landing card, or an entry voucher. The traveller is required to fill out the form, sign and submit to the customs or border protection officer before entering the country.
* When an individual or an organization ships goods across the borders, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, an import declaration form, an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. A Harmonized System Code (Hs code or harmonized code) might be required to define the type of goods and their associated tax rate. The importer is usually required to provide information about the goods' country of origin and the certificate of origin. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.

Some nations require a customs declaration form from each person crossing the border, while other nations require one form per family traveling together. A family is usually defined as family members residing in the same household, who are related by marriage, adoption, blood, or domestic relationship.

**Border Force** is a British law enforcement command within the Home Office, responsible for frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports in the United Kingdom. Previously part of the UK Border Agency which was replaced in 2013 by UK Visas and Immigration which now manages applications for people who want to visit, work, study or settle in the UK.

Border Force works with HM Revenue and Customs. HMRC's Customs Declaration Service (CDS) is replacing the long-standing CHIEF system of customs declaration.

Post Brexit, the Northern Ireland Protocol came into effect on 1 January 2021, which was subsequently revised under The **Windsor Framework,** a legal agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom which adjusts the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The Customs Declaration Service is also used for declarations on goods movements to or from Northern Ireland, including goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but other customs declarations will continue to use CHIEF pending a longer-term move to the CDS. HMRC explains that "CHIEF is a reliable and robust platform" but "its age means it can’t easily keep pace with new technology".
