Invest in Canada


# Invest in Canada



**Invest in Canada** is an arms-length Government of Canada organization that promotes and attracts foreign direct investment into Canada. It was created through the *Investment Canada Act* and launched on March 12, 2018 as a departmental corporation.


## History

Before the Invest in Canada agency was created, a division within the federal department Global Affairs Canada led the promotion of investment into Canada. In 1985, the Government implemented the *Investment Canada Act* to govern foreign direct investment. The Harper government used to limit foreign investment to no more than 50% share, through a policy designed by Nigel S. Wright during his time at the PMO.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) by country and by industry are tracked by Statistics Canada; the total in 2012 of FDI was CA$634 bn. New FDI inflow to Canada in 2011 was CA$40.8 bn. Canada was host to CA$33 bn in state-owned enterprise investment over the period between 2005 and 2012. Over the same period, the net FDI increased by CA$236.1 bn, so that SOE FDI was almost 14% of the total. Conversely, Canadian SOEs limit themselves to domestic affairs. The SOE of Canada are not aggressive in this manner: Canadian SOEs have no foreign investments.

The Canadian government is planning to raise to CA$1 bn the amount of foreign money that can go into a Canadian company before the investment is reviewed. As of 2012, an investment or takeover of a Canadian business by a WTO investor worth CA$330 mn or more triggers a federal review under the Investment Canada Act. The WTO was implemented in Canada by the *World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act* in 1994. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada provides a helpful webpage with this information and explains that WTO members are eligible for CA$344 mn review-free investment as of 12 January 2013. The WTO maintains a membership list. The information on the WTO "amount" permitted by the discretion of the Minister of Industry under subsection 14.1(2) of the Investment Canada Act is published annually in January in the Canada Gazette. The government investigates whether the investment is of "net benefit" to Canada, which brings into play a nebulous political definition. Amounts inferior to this limit do not incur political oversight under the Investment Canada Act, so that the foreign investor is treated like any other Canadian investor. This means effectively, that Canada is open to reverse takeover by stealth. Prime Minister Harper clarified this FDI policy area in Toronto on 7 November 2013 when he said that a little wiggle room was needed on foreign takeover rules.


## Bonds

On 5 November 2013, British Columbia finance minister Mike de Jong reported a successful placement of Chinese RMB$2.5bn in dim sum bonds. The issue was five times oversubscribed.

The oil sands in Alberta cover a vast area, and the pipelines needed to ferry their output to the BC coastline, where it will be transported by ship to Asian markets, span a wide range of investments. Many joint venture projects with foreign firms exist because Canadian capital is insufficient. Examples of news articles that have yet to be harvested for this wiki are a CBC article, and the BC regulator, as well as p. 13 of a report from Ernst and Young.
