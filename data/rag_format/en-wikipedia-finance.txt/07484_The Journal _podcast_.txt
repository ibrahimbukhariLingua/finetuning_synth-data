# The Journal (podcast)




***The Journal*** (stylized as ***THE JOURNAL.***) is a daily news podcast co-produced by the Swedish audio streaming service Spotify and the American business newspaper *The Wall Street Journal*, hosted by Ryan Knutsen, Kate Linebaugh, and Jessica Mendoza. Its weekday episodes are based on the *Journal* reporting of the day, with interviews of journalists from *The* *Wall Street Journal*. Episodes typically last 15 to 25 minutes.


## Background

Similar in format to other news podcasts like *The Daily* (produced by *The New York Times*) *The Journal* first debuted in June 2019, and describes itself as a show about "money, business, and power." Among the high profile topics discussed over the podcast's run since 2019 include the COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of generative artificial intelligence, and major acquisition deals (i.e. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter). It has also covered major scandals, including the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency exchange FTX followed by the trial of founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and the various investigations surrounding former and current president Donald Trump prior to his successful 2024 presidential campaign.


## Opening theme

The opening theme for The Journal is composed by So Wylie, who has composed music for other podcasts produced by Spotify including Dissect, The Habitat, and *Murder Ballads*.


## Reception

Grant Powell of *Forbes* says the podcast "inevitably crosses over into the realms of politics, news and science. ...so many of the topics they cover are global.... a great source for the very latest business news which every aspiring leader needs to be across." Jacob Riederer of Podcast.co said, "Each episode doesn’t stop at the basics—listeners get a curated list of further reading and resources from *WSJ*, making it easy to dive deeper into the topics that matter most." IHeartRadio's official website said the podcast "provides insightful analysis and engaging storytelling."
