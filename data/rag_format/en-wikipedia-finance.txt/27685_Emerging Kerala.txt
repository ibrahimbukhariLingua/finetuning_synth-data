## Mega projects

A number of Mega projects are being conceptualized and developed in the State, the most prominent of which are as follows:

| No. | Project Title | Proposed Year | Expected Completion | Project Details | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Supplementary Gas Infrastructure Project | 2015 | Not specified | A joint venture company, Kerala Gail Gas Limited (KGGL), has been established between the KSIDC and GAIL Gas Limited. KGGL will undertake activities such as city gas distribution in Kerala, the establishment of CNG stations for KSRTC buses, a gas training institute, and spur lines from GAIL's main pipeline. Additionally, the company will set up small gas-based power generating plants. The total estimated investment for the project is ₹2,000 crores ($400 million). | Delayed/Indefinitely Postponed |
| 2 | Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport | 2015 | 2024 | The Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport is an ambitious project of the Government of Kerala, being developed at Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram. The project adheres to the Landlord Port Model, wherein dredging, reclamation, and essential infrastructure such as breakwaters and quays will be undertaken by Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Government of Kerala. Port operations will be managed through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. A private operator will construct, operate, and maintain the terminal superstructure for a period of 30 years. The port development, along with its supporting infrastructure, is planned in phases, with an estimated cumulative cost of ₹7000 Crores ($1.4 billion). Upon completion, the port will offer a total quay length of 2000 meters across three phases, primarily catering to container transshipment, while also accommodating other cargo types like multi-purpose and break bulk goods. | Completed |
| 3 | Digital Science Park Phase IV | 2018 | Not specified | The Digital Science Park under construction in Thiruvananthapuram, will be India's first digital science park. Announced in the 2022-23 state budget, the Government of Kerala allocated ₹1000 crore for the development of four science parks to leverage advancements in science and technology. The first of these parks is being established near the Digital University of Kerala in Technopark Phase IV, Technocity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the park on April 25, 2023. | Under-development |
| 4 | Kochi Metro Rail Project | 2012 | 2024 (Delayed) | The project envisions constructing a world-class Light Mass Rapid Transit (LMRTS) system in Kochi to enhance the quality of life in the Greater Kochi metropolitan area. By improving regional connectivity and reducing overcrowding, traffic congestion, travel time, air, and noise pollution, the project aims to significantly uplift the region. Spanning a total of 25 kilometers, the LMRTS will feature 21 stations from Aluva to Pettah. The proposed construction method involves an elevated viaduct supported by pre-stressed concrete U-shaped girders. To execute this project, a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) named Kochi Metro Rail Limited has been established. The estimated project cost is ₹4500 crores ($900 million). | Under-development |
| 4 | Monorail Project in Thiruvananthapuram | 2012 | Not specified | This is a prestigious single-rail mass transit project of the Government of Kerala, spanning a 28.4-kilometer route between Kazhakoottam and Balaramapuram in Thiruvananthapuram district. A monorail is a rail-based transportation system supported and guided by a single rail. This monorail will be elevated on a track along the median of the main road, minimizing land acquisition as only junctions require widening. Each train will consist of four cars, accommodating over 200 passengers, and will travel at a safe speed of 40 kilometers per hour. The estimated total project cost is ₹3408 Crores ($682 million). A detailed traffic study is being conducted by the National Transportation Planning & Research Centre (NATPAC). | Delayed/Indefinitely Postponed |

Zettfly plans to use Ahmed's Air Kerala domain name to market their services. It would be the first regional airline to be based in Kerala. Zettfly is working to obtain an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) and will start operations with three ATR 72-600 aircraft. Being set up as an "ultra low-cost airline", Ahmed plans to start out with three ATR 72-600 aircraft and grow its fleet to 20 for international expansion. | Under-development |
| 9 | Palakkad Industrial Smart City | 2024 | Not specified | The Union Cabinet approved the Palakkad industrial city, part of a 12-city initiative under the National Industrial Corridor Development program.

## Permanently Halted/Abandoned Projects

The following are major infrastructure projects that have been permanently suspended or abandoned due to a combination of environmental, financial, and administrative challenges, resulting in delays or complete termination.

| No. | Project Title | Location (District) | Reason for Halting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Aranmula International Airport | Pathanamthitta | Proposed in Aranmula, this private airport project faced strong opposition from local residents and environmentalists. The airport was to be located on land that was believed to be ecologically fragile, and the Kerala High Court later ruled in favour of the opposition, leading to the project's permanent cancellation. |
| 2 | Hydro Power Projects in Silent Valley | Palakkad | The Silent Valley Hydroelectric Project, which was proposed in the 1970s, was permanently shelved following widespread protests by environmental activists and local communities. The project was believed to be a major threat to the biodiversity of the Silent Valley forest, part of the Western Ghats. |
| 3 | Athirappilly Hydroelectric Project | Thrissur | The Athirappilly hydroelectric project was halted after widespread protests from environmental groups and local communities. The project would have affected the biodiversity-rich region near the Athirappilly waterfalls, and concerns about environmental destruction and displacement led to its cancellation. |
| 4 | Vizhinjam Mother and Child Hospital | Thiruvananthapuram | The construction of a mother and child hospital in Vizhinjam, was halted midway due to issues in project management, budget overruns, and bureaucratic delays. While initially approved to provide healthcare facilities to underserved areas, it remains unfinished due to administrative hurdles. |
| 5 | Gas-Based Power Plant | Thiruvananthapuram | Proposed to provide cleaner energy, this gas-based power plant in Thiruvananthapuram was halted after initial planning due to concerns over fuel availability and environmental clearances. |
| 6 | Karapuzha Irrigation Project | Wayanad | This irrigation project was initiated to help farmers in the Wayanad region but has faced multiple delays due to budget overruns and environmental concerns. The project remains unfinished despite being planned decades ago. |
| 7 | Kannur Aerotropolis | Kannur | The Kannur Aerotropolis, envisioned as an airport city with industrial and commercial hubs, remains stalled due to land acquisition disputes and insufficient private sector interest. The project was meant to boost economic activity in the Kannur region but is currently in limbo. |
| 8 | Kerala Seaplane | Kollam | The Kerala Seaplane project, initially met with mixed reactions, faced significant setbacks. Protests from fishing communities over concerns about livelihood and the environment forced the project to relocate. Despite efforts to gain community support, the project was ultimately abandoned due to operational challenges and mounting losses. The aircraft remained grounded, and the government's expert committee was unable to complete its assessment. |
