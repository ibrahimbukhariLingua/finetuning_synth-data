# Peter Economy



**Peter Economy** is an American author, editor, and ghostwriter. Although his most-recent books tend to reside in the technology genre—particularly software product development and AWS/cloud—he has written books in a variety of other genres, including leadership, management, memoir, biography, consulting, how-to, entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, and a children’s book. Economy is The Leadership Guy on Inc.com where he has published more than 1,500 articles on a variety of topics related to leadership, management, and other business topics.

Before that, he served as Associate Editor of Leader to Leader magazine for 18 years, working closely with Frances Hesselbein, Editor-in-Chief—at first under the auspices of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management, and finally, the Frances Hesselbein Leadership Forum at Pitt University.


## Early life and education

The son of a U.S. Air Force officer, Economy was born at Hamilton Air Force Base in Novato, California. With family moves every four or five years, he spent his early life in Pennsylvania, California, Virginia, and Georgia, graduating from Warner Robins High School in Warner Robins, Georgia, and then Stanford University in Palo Alto, California with majors in Human Biology and Economics. During this time, he played French horn in school bands and the Macon (Georgia) Symphony Band before switching to electric guitar in local garage and rock bands.


## Writing

Economy is the author, editor, and ghostwriter of more than 125 books with sales of more than 3 million copies, including a Wall Street Journal bestseller. He has written about leadership and management for Leader to Leader, Gallup Business Journal, Inc.com, and Time (magazine).

He wrote his first book when, in 1989, he was asked by Dr. Bob Nelson, creator of Employee Appreciation Day, to write a book on the topic of negotiation for the publisher Scott Foresman. At the time, Economy was working as Administrative Manager for Horizons Technology, a San Diego–based software development firm. This first book, Negotiating to Win, was published in 1991, and its success eventually led Economy to abandon his management career to focus full time on writing business books and articles.

During his 18 years at Leader to Leader magazine, he worked closely with Frances Hesselbein, Editor-in-Chief, and with numerous business and academic leaders globally, providing editorial support to their articles. These leaders included Kiran Mazumar-Shaw, John Hope Bryant, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Peter Senge, Juana Bordas, Jean Lipman-Blumen, Marshall Goldsmith, Inés Temple, Jeffrey L. Bowman, Lolly Daskal, Clifton Taulbert, Ron Wallace, and others.

Economy has also written for 1099, the magazine for independent professionals, and workWELL, a publication of Unum Group.
