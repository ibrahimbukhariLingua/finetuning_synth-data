The **financial result** is the difference between earnings before interest and taxes and earnings before taxes. It is determined by the earning or the loss which results from financial affairs.


## Interpretation

For most industrial companies the financial result is negative, as the interest charged on borrowing generally exceeds income from investments (dividends). If a company records a positive financial Result over several periods, then one has to ask how much capital is invested at which interest rate, and if this capital would not bear a greater yield if it were invested in the company's growth. In case of constant, positive financial results a company also has to deal with increasing demands for special distributions to its shareholders.


## Calculation formula

In mathematical terms financial result is defined as follows:

{\displaystyle \textstyle {\begin{aligned}{\mbox{Financial result }}&={\mbox{ Interest income}}\\&-{\mbox{ Interest expense}}\\&\pm {\mbox{ Write-downs/write-ups for financial assets}}\\&\pm {\mbox{ Write-downs/write-ups for marketable securities}}\\&+{\mbox{ Other financial income and expenses}}\end{aligned}}}
