Trade costs and facilitation


# Trade costs and facilitation



Trade Costs & Facilitation: The Development Dimension is an ongoing research project on trade facilitation reform carried out by the Development Economics Research Group of the World Bank.

The project is focused on expanding knowledge about the relationships between trade costs and private sector growth and export competitiveness in developing countries. A major focus is on exploring the dynamic gains associated with lowering trade transactions costs and identifying the relative importance (net benefits) of related reform measures. The project has two primary parts: research and policy relevant analysis, and support for new data.

The project analyzes trade facilitation effects in a broad sense, as its analysis spans the entire realm of a typical international trade transaction; this includes, among other topics, the transparency and professionalism of customs and regulatory environments, the efficiency of supply chain-related infrastructure, the harmonization of product standards, and conformance to international or regional regulations.


## Leadership & Funding

The Project is led by Lead Economist John S. Wilson of the World Bank, and is funded through a Trust Fund at the World Bank established by the United Kingdom Department for International Development and a Multi-donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development.


## Research

Research associated with the project has included policy working papers, presentations, learning events, and research briefs.
