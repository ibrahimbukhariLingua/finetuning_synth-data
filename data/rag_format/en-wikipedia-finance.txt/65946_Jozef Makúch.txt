**Jozef Makúch** (born 26 August 1953 in Podhájska, Czechoslovakia) was the Governor of National Bank of Slovakia since January 2010 to June 2019. Makúch quit ahead of the end of his second mandate in January 2021, citing concerns about central bank independence he deemed threatened by the "political wrangling" he expected to follow the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election.
