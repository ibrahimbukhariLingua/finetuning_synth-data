Glarner Kantonalbank


# Glarner Kantonalbank



***Glarner Kantonalbank*** is the cantonal bank and the dominant retail banking group in the Swiss canton of Glarus. In 2014, the bank was listed in the SIX Swiss Exchange.


## Branches

In addition to the headquarters in Glarus, there are branches in Niederurnen, Näfels, Netstal, Schwanden and Linthal, but not in Glarner Sernftal, which is traditionally served by Glarner Regionalbank AG.


## Ownership

On 11 May 2010, Glarner Kantonalbank was transformed from an institution under public law into a public limited company under special law. Until an IPO in July 2014, it was wholly owned by the Canton of Glarus, with a majority stake of 68.24%. In addition to traditional advice in the mortgage and savings business, commercial lending, investment advice and asset management have gained in importance. Like the vast majority of all cantonal banks, the Glarus-based bank also has a so-called state guarantee. This means that the canton is liable for the liabilities of the bank.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
