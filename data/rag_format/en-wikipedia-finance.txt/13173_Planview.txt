**Planview** is a global enterprise software company headquartered in Austin, Texas.


## History

The company was founded in 1989 in Austin, Texas, by Patrick Durbin. Durbin is a pioneer in the project and portfolio management (PPM) industry who led Planview as CEO during the first 15 years of its growth.

In 1997, the company launched its complete web-based resource and project portfolio management (PPM) software, Planview Enterprise.

In 2004, Durbin retired from the CEO role at Planview but continued serving the company as a Board Member. Greg Gilmore, a member of the leadership team under Durbin, was named CEO. Under Gilmore's leadership, the company more than tripled its revenue and was an industry leader in delivering PPM software through the cloud by launching a software as a service (SaaS) solution.

From 2014 to 2020, Planview steadily expanded its suite of solutions through internal product development and through acquisition of other innovative companies. The acquisitions include Projectplace in 2014, Troux Technologies in 2015, Innotas in 2016, LeanKit in 2017, Spigit in 2018, and Aptage in 2020.

The company's growth attracted large investors whose resources enabled the company to continue its growth. In December 2013, Insight Venture Partners acquired a substantial interest in Planview. In January 2017, Thoma Bravo acquired Planview, becoming the majority shareholder. In December 2020, Planview was acquired by TPG Capital and TA Associates for $1.6 billion.

In 2021, Greg Gilmore retired from Planview, and Razat Gaurav was named the company's new CEO. Gaurav joined Planview after leading the growth of Llamasoft during which the company's revenue doubled. The company's recent acquisitions include Clarizen, Changepoint, Tasktop and Enrich. The company achieved record revenue in 2022 and again in 2023.
