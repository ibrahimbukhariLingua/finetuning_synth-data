Momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping


# Momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping



**Momentum accounting and triple-entry book keeping** is an alternative accountancy system developed by Japanese academic Yuji Ijiri and the subject of his 1989 monograph. It is proposed as an alternative to double-entry bookkeeping, which is the standard method used in the worldwide financial accounting system.

Momentum accounting and triple-entry bookkeeping introduce changes to traditional double-entry bookkeeping by tracking balances, revenue earning, and cash collection. These events are recorded with two entries, typically a debit and a credit, assigned on a specific date. In momentum accounting, changes in balances are the recognized events.


## Example

An acceleration in revenue earning, such as a $1,000 per period increase of revenues from $10,000 per month to $11,000 per month, would require three entries to implement.
