## History

It was founded in 1997 as TimoCom Soft- und Hardware GmbH by the entrepreneurs Jens Thiermann and Jürgen Moorbrink as well as the software developers Gunther Matzaitis and Oliver Schubert in Düsseldorf. The first part of the company name "Timo" was created from the first letters of the two first-mentioned founders. The company presented the freight, and vehicle exchange TC Truck&Cargo as its first product which enabled users to provide freight or transport vehicles digitally and avoid cost-intensive empty runs.

TIMOCOM extended its offering in the years that followed to an extensive transport platform. Amongst others, applications for cost calculation, route planning, vehicle tracking, assigning storage spaces and long-term transport tenders were developed.

TIMOCOM went online in 2006 and enabled users to place offers in real time. This step changed the processes of logistics company extensively in Europe.

Due to the fact that hundreds of thousands of offers were placed on the TIMOCOM transport platform on a daily basis, the decision was taken to provide the relationship of supply and demand as a new online service in 2009. The transport barometer is now used by many companies as a controlling factor for their pricing.

The company head office was relocated to Erkrath in 2014. A second building complex was added in 2017.

Jens Thiermann handed over the operational management to his son Tim Thiermann, Managing Partner, in 2019. Since then, he has managed the company alongside Sebastian Lehnen, Member of the Executive Board.
