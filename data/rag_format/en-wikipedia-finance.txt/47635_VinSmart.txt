VinSmart and its branding Vsmart are now largely unused brandnames of Vingroup due to the discontinuation of the respective conglomerate high-tech industry arms.


## History

VinSmart was founded in 2018 after the adquisition of BQ Company, with head office at Vinhomes Riverside, Long Biên District, Hanoi, Vietnam, first factory at Cát Hải District, Haiphong. The second factory was located at Hoa Lac Hi-tech Park, Thạch Thất District, Hanoi.

In 2020 the company presented a Vietnam-only VND600,000 (US$26) smartphone, the VSmart Bee Lite, subsidized in cooperation with Viettel. The phone is aimed at popularizing the brand and smartphones in general with the Vietnamese public.
