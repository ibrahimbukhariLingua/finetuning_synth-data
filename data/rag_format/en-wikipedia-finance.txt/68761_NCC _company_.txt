## History

The origins of NCC Construction go back to 1890 when Axel Johnson, a Swedish businessman, established "Nordstjernan" - the North Star. Later, this company became one of the leading Nordic shipping companies.

In late 1987, Nordstjernan AB began acquiring shares in the listed construction company Armerad Betong Vägförbättringar (ABV). At the time, Nordstjernan had its own construction company called Johnson Construction Company (JCC).

In spring 1988, Nordstjernan increased its shareholding in the company and, by May 21, 1988, ABV was considered a Nordstjernan subsidiary. At the company's Annual General Meeting on June 8, then President of JCC, Torsten Eriksson, was also appointed President of ABV.

On June 9, 1988, the President sent a letter containing information about the merger and upcoming integration to the company's 20,000 employees and to 30,000 business contacts.

Work on the new organization was largely completed by September 8, when 475 managers were appointed and a Group structure was established. Company President Torsten Eriksson settled the question concerning the location of the head office of NCC, as the joint company was to be called, when he selected ABV's head office on Vallgatan in Solna. Four days later, Nordstjernan was listed on the stock exchange.

On September 20, 1988, Nordstjernan acquired all of the shares in NCC from JCC, upon which the construction operations of JCC and ABV were transferred to NCC.

Following the acquisition, JCC became a subsidiary of NCC and changed its name to NCC Bygg AB. Although the NCC Group was legally formed on January 1, 1989, JCC and ABV have been assembled under a single roof and a shared logo since October 15, 1988, when a joint graphic profile was launched.

NCC Housing was a part of NCC up until 2016 and was divested into Bonava.
