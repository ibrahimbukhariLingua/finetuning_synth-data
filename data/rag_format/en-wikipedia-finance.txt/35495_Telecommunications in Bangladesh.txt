## Structure

As defined in the National Telecommunications Policy 1998 and International Long-Distance Telecommunications Services (ILDTS) Policy 2007, all mobile operators are to interconnect through Interconnection Exchange (ICX) and all international calls to be handled by International Gateway (IGW) which is to be connected to the mobile and fixed operators through the ICXs.

The Interconnection Exchange (ICX) will receive all calls from the mobile and fixed operators whenever the call is made to another network and will pass it to the destination network if the call is local, and will pass to the IGWs if the call is international. ICX will also deliver calls received from IGWs where the call is destined.

Below illustrate the structure of interconnection between different interfaces.

* dhakaFM 90.4 FM
* Radio Amber 102.4 FM
* Radio Today 89.6 FM

## Television

As of 2012, there are 23 broadcast television stations in Bangladesh, including the state-run BTV and BTV World, with 20 million television sets in the country.

The number of private satellite channels are growing. The first private channel in Bangladesh was ATN Bangla. There are 8 full-fledged news channels (ATN News, Channel 24, DBC News, Ekattor, Independent Television, Jamuna Television, News24 and Somoy TV).


## Internet

Bangladesh first received Internet access in 1996. In the recent years, Internet usage has rapidly increased. The Bangladesh government imposes a high Internet tariff, stunting the sector's growth, claims Norwegian-owned Telenor. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Due to controversy, the Bangladesh government decided to reduce the tariff by 50%.

The Bangladesh's Internet country code is .bd.

As of 2005, more than 180 Internet Service Providers are operating in the country. ISPs are regulated by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC).

In April 2010, Akhtaruzzaman Manju, president of the Internet Service Providers' Association of Bangladesh, told Xinhua that the country's six mobile phone operators and Internet Service Providers have so far provided over 800,000 Internet connections. "We've estimated that nearly 10 million people in the country are using 800,000 internet connections on a shared basis," he said, adding the number of Internet users in the country is increasing yearly by around 15-16 percent.

A 2009 study by the Boston Consulting Group found that the number of Internet subscribers in Bangladesh is likely to reach 18.3 million by 2020, equivalent to a 32 percent household Internet penetration, which will result in a 2.6 percent contribution to the country's GDP while creating 129,000 more jobs, the research added.


### Broadband Internet access

Though broadband Internet access is available, the cost of high-speed connection is higher than in other south Asian countries. Broadband Internet and e-commerce in Bangladesh is progressing slowly. WiMAX service is now available from some Internet service providers. In Bangladesh broadband is legally defined as 128/128 kbit/s, which is not in line with ITU standards.

The ISPs currently providing broadband services in Bangladesh are:

* Banglalion
* Infocom Limited
* InfoLink

## Satellite

There are six satellite Earth stations, including Talimabad, and Betbunia. Bangladesh sent its first satellite, Bangabandhu-1, into space on May 11, 2018.


## Submarine cables

Bangladesh is connected to SEA-ME-WE 4 or SMW-4 (South-East Asia – Middle East – Western Europe 4) and SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable systems. The landing site of the SMW-4 Bangladesh branch is located in Cox's Bazar and the landing site of the SMW-5 Bangladesh branch is located in Kuakata. The two submarine cables provide the country with redundancy to support uninterrupted Internet and long-distance communications and also with a huge bandwidth. Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Limited is the only submarine cable operator in Bangladesh.
