Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics


# Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics



The **Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics** is an academic prize awarded biennially by Northwestern University. It was initially endowed along with a companion prize, the Frederic Esser Nemmers Prize in Mathematics. Both are part a $14 million donation from the Nemmers brothers, who envisioned creating an award that would be as prestigious as the Nobel prize. Nine out of the past 15 Nemmers economics prize winners have gone on to win a Nobel PrizeÂ : Peter Diamond, Thomas J. Sargent, Robert Aumann, Daniel McFadden, Edward C. Prescott, Lars Peter Hansen, Jean Tirole, Paul R. Milgrom and, most recently, Claudia Goldin.
Those who already have won a Nobel Prize are ineligible to receive a Nemmers prize. The Nemmers prizes are given in recognition of major contributions to new knowledge or the development of significant new modes of analysis in the respective disciplines. As of 2023, the prize carries a $300,000 stipend, among the largest monetary awards in the United States for outstanding achievements in economics.
