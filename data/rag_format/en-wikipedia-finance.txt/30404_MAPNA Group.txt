# MAPNA Group



**MAPNA Group** (Persian: گروه مپنا) is a group of Iranian companies involved in development and execution of thermal and renewable power plants, oil & gas, railway transportation and other industrial projects as well as manufacturing main equipment including gas and steam turbines, electrical generator, turbine blade and vane, HRSG and conventional boilers, electric and control systems, gas compressor, locomotive and other pertinent equipment.

The company was initially named Iran Power Plant Projects Management Company, MAPNA (Persian: مپنا) serving as the acronym of the Persian title. The full title was dropped in October 2012 following diversification of the holding's activities, with MAPNA becoming the official trademark of the company.

MAPNA was founded in 1993 with the initial aim of becoming a general contractor for thermal power plants but evolved and diversified its business lines and capacities to other industries two decades after its establishment. The group is the first and leading Middle East-based general contractor of thermal power plants in MENA region.


## History

Historically, large scale industrial installation in Iran had been supplied by foreign companies on a turn-key basis. The Iran Power Plants Management Company (MAPNA) was founded in February 1993 by Tavanir, IDRO and Saba Investment Co. to manage power projects. The group of companies was instrumental in developing Iranian manufacturing capacity of main and auxiliary equipment for power plants, and of plant construction then. From 2001, the company entered into licensing and technology transfer
agreements for gas and steam turbines, turbine blades and vanes, electrical
generators, electric and control systems, heat recovery steam generators, compressors and electrical generators as well as railway locomotives.

MAPNA is the largest contractor for steam, gas and combined cycle and renewable power plants in Iran. By 2015, over 100 projects with a total value of €30 billion were either commissioned or under construction by the company. The projects included power generation plants with an installed capacity of more than 48000 MW. In
terms of installed capacity, MAPNA's domestic commissioned power projects comprise 46% of Iran's national grid, with a capacity of 35530 MW.[³]

The company holds offices in Indonesia, Iraq and Syria. It has carried out projects in these countries, and also in the Sultanate of Oman.

In 2005, the company was among the top dozen companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange, with a value of over $1 billion. MAPNA was the fourth largest enterprise in Tehran Stock Exchange by June 2010, with a market capitalization of $2.6 billion.[⁴] Saba, Edalat Brokerage, MAPNA Employees Investment Co. and Ayandeh Negar are key shareholders of the company, collectively holding 90% of the company stock. The remaining 10 percent is in possession of private and legal entity shareholders.
