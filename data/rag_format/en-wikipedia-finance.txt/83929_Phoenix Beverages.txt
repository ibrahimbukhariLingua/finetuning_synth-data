## History


### The Millenium Pillar (1999-2022)

‘The Millennium Pillar’ was an initiative aimed at enhancing the cityscape of Vacoas-Phoenix by erecting a magnificent statue at its bustling roundabout, colloquially known as the “ Rond-Point La Bière.” The Phoenix Millennium Pillar was a captivating piece of art originally crafted by the talented Hungarian artist, Ms. Zsuzsanna Szemok, with Mr. Pierre Lagesse serving as the project’s architect. The sculpture depicted the Vacoas tree, complete with its roots and a trunk adorned with basalt, mirroring the tree’s leaves. At its pinnacle stood a bronze rendition of a nascent Phoenix. The bronze casting was executed by Forges Tardieu foundry, while the supporting tree structure was constructed by General Construction. This monumental stele, standing 10 meters tall and spanning a meter in width, was erected in 1999 to commemorate the transition from 1999 to the year 2000 and the 35th anniversary of Vacoas/Phoenix’s elevation to a municipality. It was officially unveiled on September 23, 1999. Today, a segment of the sculpture, particularly the Phoenix, graces the entrance of Phoenix Beverages Limited.


### La Statue de la RenaiSenses (2022-present)

After more than three years of relentless effort, the new Phoenix statue emerged, paying tribute to the initiatives outlined in Phoenix Beverages Group’s sustainable development plan. This artistic masterpiece was conceptualised and curated by ZeeArts, in collaboration with Indian and Mauritian artists, Kishor Kanta and Vick Shibdoyal, respectively. The project also garnered support from Phoenix Beverages Group’s welding team, Luxconsult as the engineering consultants, and Transinvest for the groundwork at the roundabout.
Named as ‘The Statue of RenaiSenses’ or ‘La Statue de la RenaiSenses’, this sculpture powerfully encapsulates the timeless cycle of rebirth embodied by the Phoenix. Its design was meticulously crafted to exude dynamism. It stands as a profoundly contemporary, captivating piece, rooted in a recycling concept for all its constituent materials. Its composition is distinct, ingeniously integrating salvaged metals and spare metallic parts from Phoenix Beverages Group’s old bottling lines. Instead of being discarded, these materials were repurposed, promoting a sustainable
economy through waste upcycling practices. Now proudly perched on the roundabout that once housed the ‘Millennium Pillar’, this stunning ten-meter statue fills the residents of Vacoas-Phoenix with immense pride.

### Phoenix Beer

Phoenix Beer began production in 1963. On August 26, 1963, Phoenix Beer was officially launched. The inaugural tasting was conducted by Head Brewer Roger Blasco, a man deeply passionate about brewing. At the time of its inauguration, the factory employed 40 individuals with the aim to produce 35,000 hectolitres of beer annually. In the very first year, 30,000 hectolitres were produced.

Journalists remarked that his dedication to beer was so profound that he could have spent his entire life in the brewery. Once brewed, the beer was bottled in ‘Chopine’ (35 ml) and bottles (75 ml) formats, sealed with a cap, and distributed to retailers across the island.

Phoenix Beer has an ABV of 5%, and is described as a "golden lager" by the manufacturers. Their malted spring barley comes from Australia and Europe. The beer is sold in 650 ml (23 imp fl oz; 22 US fl oz) and 330 ml (12 imp fl oz; 11 US fl oz) bottles and 330 ml (12 imp fl oz; 11 US fl oz) cans. It is also available in draught at local resorts and restaurants.

Phoenix also produces two strong lager style beers. One called Blue Marlin; the other Phoenix Special Brew. They brew Guinness Foreign Extra Stout under licence.


## History behind the name

History dates back to 1845 in Mauritius, where a sugar estate named Phoenix was established at the confluence of two rivers: the Mesnil and Rivière Sèche. The estate derived its name from the endemic palm trees found exclusively in Mauritius and Réunion Island, bearing a resemblance to the Phoenician palm. Phoenix Sugar Estate, under the stewardship of Henry Barlow, clinched
a gold medal for its premium quality sugar. However, due to a financial downturn, the sugar mill ceased operations in 1874. By 1880, Phoenix Sugar Estate merged with Trianon Sugar Estate, leading to the transfer of all sugarcane plantations to the latter.
The 1892 cyclone wreaked destruction of the Trianon Sugar Estate, leaving the sugar mill building bereft of its machinery and ultimately leading to its demolition. The Phoenix region was named in homage to the sugar mill’s name. It was only later that the brewery was established in Phoenix, attributed to its favourable climatic conditions, strategic location for island-wide product
distribution, and water supply.
Thus, the beer was named after the city’s rich history, drawing inspiration from both the mythical bird and the Phoenician palms. Just as the sugar was adorned with gold medals, the beer garnered multiple accolades and stands today as a staple brand in the heart of Mauritians.
