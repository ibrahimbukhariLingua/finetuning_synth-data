The external receipts in 2009–10 are estimated at Rs 510 billion, which shows an increase of 70 percent over the budget estimates of 2008–09. The overall expenditure during 2009–10 has been estimated at Rs 2482 billion, of which the current expenditure is Rs 1699 billion, and development expenditure at Rs 803 billion.

The share of current expenditure in total budgetary outlay for 2009–10 is 68.5 percent, as compared to 79 percent in the revised estimates for 2008–09.

The expenditure on General Public Services (inclusive of debt servicing transfer payments and superannuation allowance) is estimated at Rs 1189 billion, which is 70 percent of the current expenditure. The size of Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) for 2009–10 is Rs 646 billion, while for other development expenditures an amount of Rs 157 billion has been allocated.

The PSDP shows an increase of 54 percent over the revised estimates 2008–09, which were mercilessly slashed during the current year to meet the budget deficit target agreed with the IMF. The provinces have been allocated an amount of Rs 200 billion for budget estimates 2009–10 in their PSDP.

An amount of Rs 25 billion has been allocated for Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (Erra) in the PSDP 2009–10.

Now "surcharge" will be used for taxing petroleum products from financial year i.e. 2009–10 after severe drubbing from different quarters.
Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani agreed on the proposal of 20 percent increase in salaries and pension of government employees.
