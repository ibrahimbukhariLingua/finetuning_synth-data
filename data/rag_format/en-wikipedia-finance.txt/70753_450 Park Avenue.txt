## History

In June 2002, 450 Park Avenue was purchased by Taconic Investment Partners. That company spent around $13 million on renovating the lobby, replacing the elevators, and redesigning public areas.

Five years later, in June 2007, Somerset Partners bought 450 Park Avenue for $509 million, or $1,566 per square foot ($16,860/m²). This made it the highest price per square foot paid for an office building at the time in the United States. To pay for the building, Somerset Partners signed a $175 million loan. In mid-2008, Somerset Partners also moved its head office to the building.

On October 30, 2010, a brand of the Phillips de Pury auction house opened on the first three floors of 450 Park Avenue. The first auction was held on November 8 of that year. The auction house covers an area of almost 334,000 sq ft (31,030 m²).

In February 2014, 450 Park Avenue was sold to Crown Acquisitions and Oxford Properties for $545 million.
