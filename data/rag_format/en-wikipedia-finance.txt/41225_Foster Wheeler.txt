## History

Foster Wheeler was formed in 1927 from a merger of the Power Specialty Company (which replaced American Water Works Supply Company, created by Pell and Ernest Foster in 1884) and the Wheeler Condenser & Engineering Company, which was created by Frederick Merriam Wheeler in 1891. It was originally based in New York City but later moved to Livingston, New Jersey and stayed there for nearly a quarter century before relocating to Clinton, New Jersey in 1987. In 2000, Foster Wheeler moved its incorporation to Bermuda; in 2008, it moved its incorporation to Switzerland.

The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1929.

On 26 February 2008 Foster Wheeler Announced it had acquired Biokinetics.

Foster Wheeler was acquired by AMEC plc in the second half of 2014 to form Amec Foster Wheeler. The acquisition coincided with a downturn in the price of crude oil which depressed the market for services to the energy industry and left the merged company with substantial debt.
