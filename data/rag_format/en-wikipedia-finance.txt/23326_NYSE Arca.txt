## History

In November 1994, Stuart Townsend and Gerald Putnam founded TerraNova Trading LLC, an electronic securities exchange, in Chicago. Its product, Archipelago, started accepting trading orders on January 20, 1997.

In 2005, Archipelago Holdings, the owner of ArcaEx, bought the Pacific Exchange, after what had been a close working relationship since 2001.

In 2006, ArcaEx merged with the NYSE and the name was changed to NYSE Arca.

On August 22, 2013, the Arca system sent multiple sequences to Nasdaq which overloaded the Securities Information Processor (SIP) caused by reconnection issues to Nasdaq. This in turn caused a chain effect reaction which led to the NASDAQ flash freeze.
