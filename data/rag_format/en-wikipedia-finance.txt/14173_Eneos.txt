**ENEOS Corporation** (ENEOS株式会社, *ENEOSU kabushiki gaisha*), formerly **JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corporation** (JXTGエネルギー株式会社, *JXTG Enerugī Kabushiki-gaisha*), or **NOC** or *Shin-Nisseki* (新日石) is a Japanese petroleum company. Its businesses include exploration, importation, and refining of crude oil; the manufacture and sale of petroleum products, including fuels and lubricants; and other energy-related activities. It is the largest oil company in Japan, and in recent years it has been expanding its operations in other countries.

Its products are sold under the ENEOS brand, which is also used for service stations. It also previously operated service stations under the Esso and Mobil brands under license from ExxonMobil. In 2019, as a result of JX Holdings' merger with TonenGeneral Group in 2017 to form JXTG Holdings, both brands were phased out in favour of ENEOS EneJet.


## History

The company was established 1888 as the "Nippon Oil" (日本石油, *Nihon Sekiyu*), or "Nisseki" (日石) for short. In 1999, the company merged with and absorbed the former "Mitsubishi Oil" (三菱石油, *Mitsubishi Sekiyu*). The merged company was called "Nippon Mitsubishi Oil" (日石三菱, *Nisseki Mitsubishi*) until 2002, when it was renamed back to Nippon Oil Corporation. In 2010, NOC merged with Nippon Mining to form JX Holdings, and Nippon Oil was renamed JX Nippon Oil & Energy. In 2017, JX and TonenGeneral were merged into JXTG Holdings. The company's name was slightly modified to JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy. In June 2020, ENEOS Corporation was adopted as the current name.


## Worldwide operations

The company has worldwide locations including ENEOS USA Inc. in Schaumburg, Illinois, Torrance, California, and Nippon Oil Lubricants (America), LLC, in Childersburg, Alabama. They have brought their premium brand motor oil ENEOS and SUSTINA into the United States recently. The product line includes the extremely difficult to formulate 0W-50 viscosity oil. New line of premium full synthetic motor oil SUSTINA is now available in the United States.

Nippon Oil Exploration owns a 5% share of Syncrude, a Canadian oil sands mining company, through its fully owned subsidiary Mocal Energy.

### 2011 earthquake and tsunami

On 11 March 2011, a 145,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Sendai was set ablaze by the Tōhoku earthquake. Workers were evacuated, but tsunami warnings hindered efforts to extinguish the fire until 14 March, when officials planned to do so.


## Environmental record

While developing the Rang Don Oil Field and Helang Gas Field NOEX, part of the Nippon Oil Corporation, conducted environmental impact assessments. These assessments helped them implement management plans based on the results of the assessments, specifically, how to reduce the impact of the fields on surrounding sea areas.

In 2005, Nippon Oil and Ebara-Ballard announced they were going to start field testing a 1 kW household proton-exchange membrane fuel cell system that uses coal oil as fuel. It was the world's first household test with the system. The system achieves a greater power-generation efficiency than normal heating. The system can operate in temperatures as low as -10 deg C.

In 2007, Nippon Oil was the recipient of the Nippon Keidanren Chairman's Prize in recognition of its achievements in a number of areas. They were the first in the Japanese petroleum industry to achieve a zero emission status at their refineries. They are also developing fuel cell systems as well as producing and selling sulfur-free fuel. The Rang Dong Oil Field is also one of the biggest CO₂ reduction projects in the world. The project utilizes associated gas produced along with crude oil for additional energy production.
