## Founder

Richard Holman (1923–2000) was the founder, owner and CEO of the *Wall Street Transcript* from 1963 to 1998. After a brief career in investment banking, Holman founded the *Transcript*, believing that investment professionals and casual investors would be willing to pay for information that would help them pick stocks.

From the late 1960s through late 1970s, Holman was involved in a series of court cases with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.), focused around whether the *Wall Street Transcript* published investment news or investment advice. The case ultimately ended in 1978 with *S.E.C. v. Wall Street Transcript*, in which the publication was determined to be a legitimate news organization and not an investment adviser.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Holman was born in New York City, son of former New York state assemblyman Abraham Goodman. He graduated from Cornell University and served in the Army during World War II in Japan and the Philippines.
