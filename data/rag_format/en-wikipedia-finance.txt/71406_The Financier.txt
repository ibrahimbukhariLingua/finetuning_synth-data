## Plot summary

In Philadelphia, Frank Cowperwood, whose father is a banker, makes his first money passing by an auction sale; he successfully bids for seven cases of Castile soap, which he sells to a grocer the same day with a profit of over 70 percent. Later, he gets a job in Henry Waterman & Company, and leaves it for Tighe & Company. He also marries an affluent widow, in spite of his young age. Over the years, he starts investing and misusing municipal funds with the aid of the City Treasurer, George Stener. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire causes a stock market crash, prompting him to be bankrupt and exposed. He attempts to browbeat his way out of being sentenced to jail by intimidating Stener. However, politicians from the Republican Party, who themselves often stoop to bribery and misuse of city funds, use him as a scapegoat for their own corrupt practices. Meanwhile, he has an affair with Aileen Butler, the daughter of one of his business partners. She vows to wait for him after his jail sentence. Her father, Edward Butler dies, and she grows apart from her family.
