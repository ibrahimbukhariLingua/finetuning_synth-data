## Roles and responsibilities


### Co-operative Societies (1949-1995)

The Registrar of Co-Operative Societies was established under the *Building and Co-operative Societies Act* 1901. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies could inquire into the working and financial condition of a society or authorise any public servant, accountant, or actuary to inspect any minutes or books or to examine into, and report upon, the affairs of a society. In 1923 and advisory council was established by the *Co-operation, Community Settlement and Credit Act* 1923, to make recommendations to the Treasurer. The Council submitted recommendations about the rules and regulations relating to societies and any action to be taken by the Treasurer, including the appointment of committees. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies was an ex officio member of the Council and the Treasurer could attend any meeting, and would preside over such meetings. The ministerial position was created in a ministerial reshuffle in the second McGirr ministry October 1949 with responsibilities transferring from the Treasurer to the Minister for Co-operative Societies. The inaugural minister Clarrie Martin held the portfolio in addition to his portfolio of Attorney–General.

From February 1983 the ministerial responsibilities were transferred to the Minister for Housing. The responsibilities were transferred to the Attorney General in January 1986, with the portfolio being formally re-created in February 1986 and filled by Terry Sheahan, who was also the Attorney General. The portfolio was abolished in the first Greiner ministry in March 1988 with the responsibilities allocated to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. It was re-created in the second Greiner ministry. It was abolished in April 1995 and the responsibilities transferred to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs.


### Consumer Affairs (1973-1995)

The portfolio was established in December 1973 in the sixth Askin ministry and the major task of the portfolio was to ensure consumers were treated fairly. This was handled by consumer education, providing a complaints service, licensing some occupational groups, investigating prices and charges, responsible for weights and measures and landlord and tenant matters. The administrative units responsible to the Ministry included the Consumer Affairs Council and Consumer Affairs Bureau, the Weights and Measures Office, the Prices Branch and Registry of Consumer Claims Tribunals. The establishment of the Ministry also coincided with three entirely new acts of Parliament dealing with important aspects of consumer protection, namely the *Consumer Claims Tribunals Act* 1974, the *Pyramid Sales Act* 1974 and the *Motor Dealers Act* 1974.

The Fair Trading Minister is responsible for the regulation of various occupations, organisations and industries including incorporated associations, hairdressers, charitable fundraisers, pawnbrokers, biofuels and co-operatives.
