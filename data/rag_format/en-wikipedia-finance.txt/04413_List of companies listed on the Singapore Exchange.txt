# List of companies listed on the Singapore Exchange



As of January 2019, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) has 640 mainboard listings and 215 catalist listings.

Companies are only listed on the Singapore Exchange if they do well. If their average daily market capitalisation is less than $40 million over the last 120 market days, then it is placed on a watch-list, and if it does not improve within two years it is delisted from the Singapore Exchange. The list here is correct as of 6 December 2020.
