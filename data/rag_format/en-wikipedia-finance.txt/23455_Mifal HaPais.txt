# Mifal HaPais



**Mifal HaPais** (Hebrew: מפעל הפיס) is Israel's government-owned lottery company. It comprises the state's near monopoly on legal gambling together with the Israel Sports Betting Board (ISBB) (Hebrew: המועצה להסדר ההימורים בספורט). The name translates to *The Institute of Lottery*

In 2012, Mifal HaPais's annual revenue was estimated at ₪5,000,000,000 a year.


## History

Mifal HaPais was established in August 1951 to recruit funding for the construction of a hospital in Tel Aviv. At first, the project's profits were used only for healthcare applications. Later on, when Mifal HaPais became a national lottery organization, its support was extended to projects in the fields of education, recreation, and the arts.

In 2007, lottery revenues were ₪3,848,000,000, of which ₪2,400,000,000 were granted as prizes and ₪1,100,000,000 used for various public projects.

Before 2012, 46% of the profits or 10% of revenues, whichever is higher, was invested in building classrooms and day-care centers. Another 46% was distributed to local authorities, and 7.5% to other projects. A new licensing agreement grants the Ministry of Finance broad oversight and an authority will be established to supervise all legal gambling in Israel. Mifal HaPais will be required to publish criteria for allocating funding.


## Games

* Lotto – a weekly game where the participant chooses 6 numbers out of 37 and an additional one number out of 7. Mifal HaPais draws 6 numbers of 37 and 1 number of 7, and the maximum prize is paid for matching all of them. Various options allow the user to bet double, play random numbers, 5 numbers plus a random number, or all combinations of 7–12 numbers. The drawings are held once on Tuesday and once on Saturday, with occasional drawings on Thursday. The prize pool is a minimum of ₪5,000,000 and a maximum of ₪80,000,000.
* Chance – a game using a virtual stripped deck of playing cards, with only the A and K–7 of each suit (32 cards). The participant chooses four cards – one of each suit. Mifal HaPais draws four cards (one from each suit) and the participant can win by matching 1, 2, 3, or 4 winning cards. Three different variants are available, with different payout schedules. The game is run every two hours 10:00–22:00 Sunday–Thursday, 10:00, 12:00, and 14:00 on Fridays and holidays, and 21:00 and 22:45 on Saturday.

The game is run at 21:00 Sunday–Thursday, 13:00 Friday, and 22:45 Saturday.
