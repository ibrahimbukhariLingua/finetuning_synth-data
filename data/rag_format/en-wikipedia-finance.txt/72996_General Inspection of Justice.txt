General Inspection of Justice


# General Inspection of Justice



The **Inspección General de Justicia (IGJ)** is a dependent organism of the Ministry of Justice in Argentina in charge of the Public Registry of limited companies and the registration of civil entities in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. It also oversees savings and loan associations on a national level.


## Civil entities

Civil entities in Argentina must comply with a series of administrative obligations to remain operational. These include the annual presentation of economic management, updating authorities, and maintaining an updated headquarters. Meeting these obligations is a prerequisite to accessing benefits provided by regulations, such as exemption from taxes before the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos.


### Foundations

Foundations are established through the contribution of assets from one or more individuals, whether physical or legal, and are aimed at fulfilling a specific public good purpose. To establish a foundation, it is essential to have an initial asset equivalent to ten minimum living wages. Foundations require a public instrument for their establishment and must obtain state authorization to operate.


### Civil Associations

Civil associations are organizations formed by a group of people who come together with a specific social objective, without profit motives. These entities must also have an initial asset that ensures the fulfillment of their goals, with specific amounts varying according to the nature of the association. Civil associations are classified into three categories based on their annual income.
