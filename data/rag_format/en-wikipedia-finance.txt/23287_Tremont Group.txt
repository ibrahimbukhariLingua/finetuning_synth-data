### Madoff scheme fallout

The hedge fund lost $3.3 billion, representing more than half its assets, in the Madoff investment scandal.

When the scheme was uncovered in December 2008, Brad Alford, who runs Alpha Capital Management LLC, which helps clients choose hedge funds, said:

> It's mind-boggling that people like Tremont ... had been doing this for so long. It's the job of these funds of funds to be doing due diligence. That's why they get paid.


### Madoff scheme litigation

In April 2010, Judge Thomas Griesa, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed a lawsuit by Tremont Group investors against Tremont's auditor, KPMG, which charged that KPMG had failed to discover the fraud in its audits of Tremont and was therefore liable to the investor. Judge Griesa held that KPMG could not be sued, because there was no intent to deceive. He wrote: "Merely alleging that the auditor had access to the information by which it could have discovered the fraud is not sufficient."

In December 2010, Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee in the Madoff bankruptcy, sued Tremont for over $3 billion in customer money that Tremont lost by investing with Madoff. The lawsuit alleged that Tremont failed to perform independent, reasonable, and meaningful due diligence of Madoff. In July 2011, Tremont Group agreed to settle the lawsuit by paying a $1 billion cash settlement.
