#### *Germany: The Empire Within*

Shlaes's first book was *Germany: The Empire Within*, about German national identity at the time of reunification. She has also written articles about this time period, including a piece in *The New Yorker* on the Deutsche mark and the euro.


#### *The Greedy Hand*

She followed that book with *The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What to Do About It.* It was a national bestseller. Fred Goldberg, a former IRS Commissioner, called it "a terrific book on the history of politics and taxing in America ... a must read—whether you come from the left, right, or mushy middle." Steve Forbes described *The Greedy Hand* as "the economic bible for those who believe in growth".


#### *The Forgotten Man*

Shlaes's next book, *The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression*, was published in 2007 and was a study of the Great Depression in the United States and the New Deal. This book argues that both Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt promoted economic policies that were counterproductive, prolonged the Great Depression, and established a modern "entitlement trap." *The Forgotten Man* was a *New York Times* bestseller for 19 weeks, with over 250,000 copies in print.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ It has also been published in German, Italian, Korean, Chinese (Mandarin) and Japanese.

Economist Paul Krugman has criticized *The Forgotten Man*, taking issue with its central tenet that New Deal policies exacerbated the Great Depression. Krugman wrote of "a whole intellectual industry, mainly operating out of right-wing think tanks, devoted to propagating the idea that FDR actually made the Depression worse.... But the definitive study of fiscal policy in the 1930s, by the MIT economist E. Cary Brown, reached a very different conclusion: Fiscal stimulus was unsuccessful 'not because it does not work, but because it was not tried'." Krugman specifically accused Shlaes of disseminating "misleading statistics." Shlaes responded to Krugman in *The Wall Street Journal*, specifically saying that for her estimates of employment and unemployment during the period she used the Lebergott/Bureau of Labor Statistics series. She wrote that statistician Stanley Lebergott "intentionally did not include temporary jobs in emergency programs—because to count a short-term, make-work project as a real job was to mask the anxiety of one who really didn't have regular work with long-term prospects."

Shlaes went on to say that if the Obama administration "proposes F.D.R.-style recovery programs, then it is useful to establish whether those original programs actually brought recovery. The answer is, they didn't."

Writing in *Forbes*, Hudson Institute fellow Diana Furchtgott-Roth first lays out Shlaes's view: "She points out that federal spending during the New Deal did not restore economic health. Unemployment stayed high and the Dow Jones Industrial average stayed low." After then explaining Krugman's position that "the New Deal failed to spend enough money to achieve full employment," Furchtgott-Roth concludes, "the new president needs to listen to many voices."

Journalist Jonathan Chait has called the book self-contradictory, misleading, and inaccurate. Novelist and essayist John Updike criticized the book as "a revisionist history of the Depression".


#### *Coolidge*

Shlaes is the author of *Coolidge*, which debuted at number three on the New York Times bestseller list. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan listed it as one of the best books of 2013. On February 13, 2013, MSNBC published an excerpt of *Coolidge* onto its Morning Joe blog as part of a discussion on "books breaking new ground on the way we think about American presidents ... [including] Coolidge who has reemerged as a hero of small government Republicanism.".

During the show, Sam Tanenhaus, editor of *The New York Times Book Review*, praised Shlaes as "a brilliant journalist, who has a great feel for where the Republican party happens to be at any particular moment and instead of just echoing what's being said, she'll look ahead a bit ... she's saying there's an older style of Republican politics that the party may be able to recapture." In an interview with the National Review Online, Shlaes said she was interested in profiling Coolidge because he is "the forgotten president.... But his economic performance and his statesmanship suggest [he] belongs in the top quarter of presidents."

In *The Wall Street Journal*, Shlaes explains how Calvin Coolidge was able to cut taxes especially the top marginal rates by following Andrew Mellon's method of "scientific taxation", reduce the national debt, and balance the budget. Shlaes writes "those who are even now pondering presidential runs for 2016 would do well to heed Silent Cal's deeds." *The Economist* gives Shlaes' and her latest book high praise for revisiting an overlooked presidency. "American readers who believe intervention to be a good thing are likely to blanch at a controversial new biography of Coolidge ... However, if they are brave enough to read on they will also discover a presidency of remarkable achievement that has received too little attention.... Ms. Shlaes's biography provides a window onto an unfairly tarnished period. It deserves to be widely read."

Robert Merry of *The Wall Street Journal* praised *Coolidge*, writing, "The Coolidge years represent the country's most distilled experiment in supply-side economics.... That success is the central Coolidge legacy, brought home with telling authority in Ms. Shlaes's work." Jacob Heilbrunn of *The New York Times* commends Shlaes' thorough work, commenting, "(Shlaes) has assiduously researched Coolidge's life, drawing both on his private papers (going so far as to photograph his appointment books) and on contemporary newspaper reports."

Philip Seib, professor and director of the Center on Public Diplomacy at the University of Southern California, praises Shlaes for revealing Coolidge's fiscal discipline in the *Dallas Morning News*. He writes, "Calvin Coolidge was very much a man and a president of his times. Shlaes deserves thanks for helping us, nearly a century after his tenure, to consider his approach to economic policy and the presidency, as well as his place in history." *Coolidge* debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list for nonfiction on March 3, 2013, at number three.


#### Other work

Shlaes also wrote the foreword to *Seeds of Destruction*, a book by Glenn Hubbard, Dean of Columbia Business School, and economist Peter Navarro. She also wrote the introduction to *Wall Street Journal* editor George Melloan's The Great Money Binge: *Spending Our Way to Socialism*.

In 2003, she coauthored, with the late Robert Bartley of *The Wall Street Journal*, a piece on tax philosophy, published in the Manhattan Institute's Turning Intellect into Influence. She also contributed to, along with Harold James and Samuel Gregg, 2012 the book *Natural Law, Economics and the Common Good*, which examines the nature and scope of ethics in relation to global economics, especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

Shlaes also was a contributor to the special 30th anniversary edition of the scholarly journal *Tax Notes*. Her essay was titled "The Future of American Taxation".

In 2012, she authored an article entitled 'Growth Lessons from Calvin Coolidge' in *The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs*, published by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.

*Great Society: A New History* was published in 2019 as a companion to *The Forgotten Man*. In the book, she argues that Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society was a failure despite the planners' good intentions.


### Awards and honors

* In 2001, Shlaes was included in *Yale Alumni Magazine*'s list of "Who's Been Blue".
* She was the 2002 co-winner of the International Policy Network's Frederic Bastiat Prize, an international prize for writing on political economy.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
* In 2003, she spent several months at the American Academy in Berlin as the JP Morgan Fellow for finance and economy.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
