IDonate


# IDonate



**iDonate** is an online fundraising platform for charities and non profit organisations in Ireland. It was launched in 2011, and available to charities, nonprofit organisations and crowdfunders in Ireland.


## Formation and organisation

iDonate was formed in 2013 by Alan Coyne. Coyne was then technical director with Western Webs in Tuam, County Galway, and later developed the iCrowdFund crowdfunding website and a micro-donations app.

iDonate is a private company, and is a member of Fundraising Ireland, the association for professional fundraisers in Ireland.

iDonate was a recipient of the SCCUL Entrepreneurship Social Enterprises Award in 2012, was a regional finalist in the Ulster Bank Business Achievers Awards in 2013, and was featured by Silicon Republic as "Tech Start-up of the Week" in July 2013.

In 2019, iDonate's Charity Tax Back service introduced electronic signatures on CHY3/4 Charitable Donation Scheme forms. It launched an online raffle creator in 2020, and a personal fundraising & crowdfunding service in 2022.
