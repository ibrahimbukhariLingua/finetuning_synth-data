**Pricelock** is an American oil company. It provides fuel hedging for small and medium-sized enterprises.


## Company history

Founded in 2006, Pricelock is headquartered in Redwood City, California. A deal with Chrysler in May 2008 guaranteed new-car buyers a gasoline price of $2.99 for three years. While the deal didn't stop Chrysler from going into bankruptcy, it brought Pricelock 24,500 new customers, and led to a similar deal with Hyundai. In March 2011, Pricelock raised over $12 million in second-round financing, and expects to be profitable by the end of 2012.
