# U.S. Bank Building (Boise)



The **US Bank Building** is a high-rise building in the western United States, located in Boise, Idaho. Completed 46 years ago in 1978 and renovated in 2004, it rises 267 feet (81 m) spanning 19 floors. The tallest building in the state for over thirty years, it was surpassed by the 323-foot (98 m) Eighth & Main Building, which opened in 2014.


## History

Originally "Idaho First Plaza," the building was the headquarters of the Idaho First National Bank, which was founded in 1867. Built by EmKay Development and Realty Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Boise-based Morrison-Knudsen, it opened in September 1978.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Following acquisitions in neighboring states, IFNB changed its name to West One Bank in 1989, and was acquired by U.S. Bank of Portland in 1995.

In 2000, the building was purchased by the property development firm Unico.

The building does not have a 13th floor. It is home to an annual Christmas tree display atop its roof that adds 85 feet (26 m) to the building's height; due to the extended height, the Federal Aviation Administration requires it to remain lit with safety beacons. The U.S. Bank Building was the tallest structure in Idaho until a new air traffic control tower at Boise Airport surpassed it in 2010.
