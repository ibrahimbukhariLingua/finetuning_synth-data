International Centre for Tax and Development


# International Centre for Tax and Development



The **International Centre for Tax and Development** (**ICTD**) is a research centre based at the Institute of Development Studies. The ICTD is focused on improving tax policy and administration in lower-income countries through collaborative research and engagement. It supports its partners in raising more revenue to fund public services in ways that are efficient, equitable, and strengthen accountability.

The ICTD was founded in 2010. It is funded by the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad).

The ICTD fosters a network of social science researchers from developing countries to engage with taxation issues by funding research, delivering research courses and workshops, and collaborating with a range of partners including various African tax administrations and ministries of finance. It disseminates its research evidence to policymakers through publications, communications, and conferences in Africa. Through its work, the ICTD aims to contribute to advancing sustainable development by reducing inequality, fostering inclusive growth, and enhancing governance.


## Research

The ICTD's research aims to generate knowledge to make tax systems in lower-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, more efficient, fair and transparent. To this end, the ICTD conducts and provides grants for research on the following themes:

* Tax administration and compliance
* Tax and governance
* Subnational and property tax
* Informality and tax
* International tax
* Tax, welfare, and inequality
* Gender and tax

In order to facilitate better research on tax issues, the ICTD created the Government Revenue Dataset, the most complete and accurate cross-country dataset on government revenue, which importantly separates natural resource revenue from other revenue streams. In early 2019, UNU-WIDER launched the GRD Explorer, a tool that allows users to quickly and easily access and visualise the data contained in the Government Revenue Dataset.
