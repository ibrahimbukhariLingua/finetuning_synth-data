Hypo Noe Landesbank


# Hypo Noe Landesbank



**HYPO NOE Landesbank für Niederösterreich und Wien AG** (short: **HYPO NOE**) is an Austrian regional bank. It is one of the oldest and largest regional banks and was created in 1888.

Within the Group, *HYPO NOE* is a partner for the public sector, real estate and key accounts as well as private and business customers in the core market of Lower Austria, Vienna and selectively in the Danube region. The Province of Lower Austria is the 100 percent owner of the bank.


## History


### Foundation & first years

The oldest part of the Group is the *Landesbank*, which was founded as the *Landes-Hypothekenanstalt für Niederösterreich* in 1888. As part of the partial privatization, 26% was sold to *Österreichische Volksbanken-Aktiengesellschaft*.


### Restructuring in Hypo Landesbank

In 1998 the bank moved its group headquarters to Sankt Pölten. In 1999, *ÖVAG's* share was increased to 41%. In 2007, the state bought back *ÖVAG* shares and the bank was divided into *HYPO Investmentbank AG* and *Niederösterreichische Landesbank-Hypothekenbank Aktiengesellschaft* (*HYPO Landesbank*). Since this date, it has again been wholly owned by the Province of Lower Austria.

In September 2017, the banking operations of *HYPO NOE Gruppe Bank AG* and *HYPO NOE Landesbank AG* were merged. From 23 September 2017, the merged bank operated under the names *HYPO NOE Landesbank für Niederösterreich und Wien AG*. By reintegrating the retail and residential construction business into the core bank, efficiency increases could be ensured by reducing the complexity of the organisation and leveraging operational synergy effects.

On 20 July 2017, *Investment* was dropped from its company name which became Hypo Vorarlberg Bank AG.


### Current developments

In autumn 2012, General Director Peter Harold opened a new corporate headquarters in Sankt Pölten on behalf of the HYPO NOE Group with a net floor area of around 19,000 m². In addition to these infrastructure measures, the company also intends to continue focusing on sustainable development in its business areas in the federal state of Lower Austria, according to the management board, and has been preparing a sustainability/CSR report on the subject since 2013.

## Controversies

In 2007, Hypo Investmentbank acquired a 20% stake in Augustus Funding Ltd. (Dublin) in the amount of approximately €800 million and is said to have speculated on €40 million. According to the *Oesterreichische Nationalbank* (OeNB) and the Financial Market Authority (FMA), these investments exceeded the large investment limit. The FMA penalty of €58 million was paid in 2011 and taken into account in the annual financial statements. This requirement was challenged by HYPO NOE before the Administrative Court, HYPO NOE was proved right in 2013 and the full amount was remitted to the bank.

The preliminary proceedings initiated by the public prosecutors office years ago in connection with the crash of the securities of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, were discontinued in 2017 because there were no indications of any misconduct on the part of the executive bodies of HYPO NOE.
