Lux filed a criminal complaint against Sutil for physical assault and grievous bodily harm. In January 2012 Sutil was found guilty by a court in Munich and given an 18-month suspended prison sentence and fined €200,000. Sutil later planned to appeal his sentence, as well as the prosecutor, though Sutil decided against it.


## Damage to reputation

Several media revealed in 2022 that Eric Lux had been the target of an online smear campaign orchestrated by his former associate Flavio Becca through a communications agency.


## Suspicions of wrongdoing

According to the documents of the Mossack Fonseca firm, Gravity Sport Management, Eric Lux’s society, would be involved in the Panama Papers, tax evasion scandal.

The Ban Manor buyout to the Charlie Chaplin Foundation has provoked the resignation of the manor’s treasurer because of the lack of transparency of the funds used for the buyout. Philippe Meylan, the land developer has himself admitted that « the Genii capital participation can include some Russian funds » according to the newspaper Le Monde.

Furthermore, Lux's name has been mentioned in the money deprivation scandal of the Malaysian fund, 1MDB. The Luxembourger Wort has revealed that the Lux's partner, Gérard Lopez, has met Tarek Obaid and his partner Turki Bin Abdullah Al Saoud (suspected in this scandal), while the origin of the funds used for the F1 was difficult to recover.
