National Credit Network


# National Credit Network



The **National Credit Network** is an Iranian food, staple and other goods coupon ration program established by the government of Iran in June 2023.

Grocery stores, wholesalers, and supermarkets can register to sell eligible products, while purchases made in a few national chain stores (such as Refah) may be covered by coupons.
