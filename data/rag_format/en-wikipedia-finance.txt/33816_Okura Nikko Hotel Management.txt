## History

JAL Hotels has been a hotel management company since its establishment in 1970 as a subsidiary of Japan Airlines Co. Ltd.

On September 30, 2010, the sale of JAL Hotels to Hotel Okura Co., Ltd. resulted in JAL Hotels becoming mainly owned by Hotel Okura, which holds 79.6% shares in the company, while Japan Airlines retains 11.1%; with 9.3% held by banks, other investors. The company renamed itself as Okura Nikko Hotel Management Co., Ltd. on 1 October, 2015.
