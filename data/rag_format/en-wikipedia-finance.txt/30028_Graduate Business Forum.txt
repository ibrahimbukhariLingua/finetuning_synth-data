Graduate Business Forum


# Graduate Business Forum



The "**Graduate Business Forum"** (**GBF**) is a United States based non-profit foundation, best known for its annual global Graduate Business Conference. The conference brings together top business leaders, political leaders, governments and selected students from the top 55 MBA Business Schools in the world to exchange the ideas about best practices on "Student-Government Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)", "Community Services" and to discuss the "Most Challenging Issues" facing the world from the perspective of a responsible leadership. The Forum also organizes a series of regional meetings throughout the year.

The Graduate Business Forum was founded in 1983 by Jim Deveau, a then MBA student and President of the student government at Columbia Business School. Beyond conferences, the Forum produces articles on ethical and responsible leadership of the MBA community and engages its members in business schools or community initiatives.


## Organization

The Forum is headquartered in Fairfield, Connecticut, United States. It is impartial and not-for-profit and is not tied to any political, partisan or national interest. Its highest governance body is the Board of Directors consisting of business, academic and previous student government leaders from multiple locations worldwide.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Global Student Leadership Award

The Student Leadership Award was inaugurated in 1991 by the board of directors of the Graduate Business Forum (GBF) to recognize leadership, innovation, and a commitment to the greater community at the graduate business level. In the past, influential leaders, such as CEOs, prime ministers, presidents, and royalty have bestowed this award upon a student or team during a commemorative banquet at the annual Graduate Business Conference.

Dave Chonowski and Chris Petersen, 2009 awardees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, turned their winning idea into the MBA Veterans Network, a global community of military veteran students and alumni of the world's leading business schools. Their organization has generated significant interest from the business media and has since been featured in both BusinessWeek and the Wall Street Journal.

Member schools may execute up to two nominations for their institution.
