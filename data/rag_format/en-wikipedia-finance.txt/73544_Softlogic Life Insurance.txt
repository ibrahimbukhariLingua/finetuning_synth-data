## History

Asian Alliance Insurance was founded in 1999 as a joint venture between Asia Capital PLC and Richard Pieris & Company. Softlogic Holdings and its subsidiary Softlogic Capital PLC acquired a 73.5% of stake in Asian Alliance Insurance for LKR3.3 billion in 2011. Asia Capital PLC was the seller. When the announcement of Softlogic's acquisition came to light, Richard Pieris moved to incorporate a finance company and an insurance company. Richard Pieris also planned to move its insurance business out of Asian Alliance Insurance to the new venture. Richard Pieris accepted Softlogic Capital's mandatory offer and divested its 25% stake in Asian Alliance Insurance. Subsequently, Softlogic reduced its stake in the company by divesting 19% of the stake each to the development finance companies DEG and FMO for LKR1.8 billion in 2012.

The industry regulator, the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, stipulated that insurance companies should segregate their life and non-life insurance businesses in 2015. Newly incorporated Asian Alliance General Insurance received the licence to operate in the non-life insurance sector. Softlogic sold Asian Alliance General Insurance to Fairfax Financial in 2016 for LKR1.1 billion. In the same year, the company was renamed Softlogic Life Insurance. Softlogic Life Insurance was featured in *Forbes Asia'*s Best Under a Billion list in 2019.
