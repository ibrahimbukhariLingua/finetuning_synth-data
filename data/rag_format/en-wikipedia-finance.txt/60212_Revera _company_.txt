## Controversy

In October 2006, PSPIB Destiny Inc., a subsidiary of the Public Sector Pension Investment Board (a Canadian Crown corporation) offered to purchase all outstanding units of Retirement Residences REIT at $8.35 per unit. In 2007, PSPIB Destiny Inc. completed the purchase of all units, which were subsequently delisted from the TSX. The company's name was then changed to Revera Inc.

In 2011, Revera acquired Comcare and became one of Canada's largest home care providers. In 2015, Extendicare purchased Revera Home Health, incorporating it into its Paramed Home Health division.

In 2014, Thomas G. Wellner was appointed as Revera's president and CEO. Also in 2014, Revera, in partnership with Health Care REIT (HCN), acquired the management company of Sunrise Senior Living. In 2015, Revera, in partnership with Welltower, acquired Regal Lifestyle Communities.

In January 2019, Revera was facing approximately 85 lawsuits across Canada for neglect contributing to death.

In Manitoba, a number of covid outbreaks took place in Revera managed care homes. As of November 26, 48 people died at Maples, 28 at Parkview Place, 4 at Heritage Lodge and one each at Poseidon and Beacon Hill Lodge. Revera was in the news as a paramedic whistleblower revealed insufficient staffing, multiple deaths, and widespread dehydration and hunger among residents at one home, where 8 residents died over the course of a weekend.
