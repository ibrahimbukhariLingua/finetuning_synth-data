## Early life

Studennikov was born in the village of Levokumsky, located on the bank of the Kuma River in the north-eastern part of the Stavropol Territory. After the birth of their son, his parents moved to the small town of Bakal in the Satka District in the west of the Chelyabinsk Region. After finishing school, Sergei Studennikov entered the technical specialty at the Mining and Ceramics College in the city of Satka.

After graduating from college, Sergei Studennikov worked in his specialty in the mining industry, then went into the army. After returning from service, he moved to Chelyabinsk. According to the businessman himself, the move was not easy for him. Due to the lack of funds, friends and family ties, he lived at the train station for a couple of weeks in the winter and worked as a loader at the market. He does not like to remember this period. *"Since childhood, I dreamed of being a salesman. “My mother would send me to buy groceries every day, and I was jealous: this man at the checkout didn’t have to stand in line, while the others stood there for hours,”* Studennikov said in an interview with RBC magazine in 2019. He does not have a higher education.


## Career

Studennikov began his entrepreneurial career in the 1990s with the retail sale of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and building materials.

In 2006, Studennikov opened the first “Red&White” liquor store in the city of Kopeysk, which is located ten kilometers from Chelyabinsk. The timing was very good, since the closure of imports in favor of the introduction of EGAIS led to a shortage of alcohol.

In October 2018, the “Red&White” chain consisted of 6,700 stores and was the “fastest-growing large retailer” in Russia*. “Our stores are not liquor stores, but “convenience stores”, that is, stores within walking distance. In liquor stores, the share of alcohol sales is 80-90%, and for us it is less than a quarter; everything else is food, drinks, everyday goods, tobacco. This format is in high demand, it is a trend in the global and Russian markets, most of our competitors have also begun to actively develop in this format. It is strange to accuse us of rapid growth if it is in demand among consumers around the world. In Japan, for example, there are 100 thousand stores of this format,”* said Sergey Studennikov in an interview with RBC.

In 2019, Sergey Studennikov, together with Igor Kesaev (owner of the Dixy Group of Companies and co-owner of the Bristol retail chain) and Sergey Katsiev (co-owner of the Bristol retail chain), decided to merge the retail chains into a single retailer.

In September 2019, shareholders of the retail chains of the Dixy group of companies (the Dixy and Victoria stores and the Ural Megamart chain), “Red&White” and Bristol completed the merger of their retail businesses, creating the holding company DKBR Mega Retail Group Limited[12], which was subsequently renamed Mercury Retail Group Limited. Under the terms of the merger, the founder of the “Red&White” retail chain, Sergei Studennikov, owns 49%, and the owners of Dixy and Bristol, Igor Kesaev and Sergei Katsiev, own 51%.[13] The merger of the three retailers significantly changed the balance of power in food retail. The group of companies took third place among the largest retailers in Russia according to Forbes, became the third largest retailer based on the results of the first half of 2021 in the Kommersant Publishing House rating, entered the rating of "200 Largest Private Companies in Russia - 2021" according to Forbes, taking 13th place, became the third largest private employer in Russia and the third company in Russia in terms of revenue in the trade sector according to RBC in the rating "RBC-500.
