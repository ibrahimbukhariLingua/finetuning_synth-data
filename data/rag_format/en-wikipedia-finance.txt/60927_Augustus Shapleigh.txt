## Life

Shapleigh was the son of Captain Richard Waldron Shapleigh and Dorothea Blaisdell Shapleigh. His father was captain of the *Granville*. In 1813, at the age of 37, Captain Richard Shapleigh died at sea with his ship, which was wrecked off Rye Beach, New York.

In 1843, Shapleigh founded one of the first hardware stores in St. Louis on behalf of Rogers, Field & Company. The following year the company was renamed Rogers, Shapleigh & Company. The original store was a four-story building at 412-422 Main Street. The site was chosen for its proximity to the Mississippi River, which was the main source of transportation for goods at the time.
