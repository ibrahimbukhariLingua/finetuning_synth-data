Subrahmanyam is mainly known for two academic contributions: The first is a behavioral (psychological) theory for the superior performance of value stocks and the phenomenon of stock market momentum. This contribution was adjudged to be the winner of the Smith Breeden prize for the best paper published in the Journal of Finance during 1998.

In the press, Subrahmanyam discussed Apple Inc.'s stock price in 2013, when there was a spike in trading prices. Following it racing to a record high of over $700, the stock quickly fell to below $400 for the first time since 2011. Appearing on CNBC, Subrahmanyam stated that the activity was likely due to over exuberance on the upside can lead to herd-like behaviour. During the same year, he also commentated on the growth of the bitcoin currency. Subrahmanyam stated that he believed one of the biggest drawbacks of the crypto-currency was that merchants were not made to accept the currency, which leads to uncertainty in its everyday use.
