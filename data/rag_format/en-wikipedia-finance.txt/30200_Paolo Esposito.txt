## Research

Through his 2009 study, Esposito explored a new governance model for Italian Public Administration aimed at combating corruption and enhancing accountability by increasing citizen participation. Three years later, in 2012, he examined the impact of IFRIC 12 on accounting for Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and Service Concession Arrangements, focusing on how it clarified and systematized related concepts and definitions, particularly in Italy, and evaluated its effectiveness in reducing conceptual vagueness and improving the management of these arrangements. In 2014, he authored a chapter in the book titled *Sovereign Risk and Public-Private Partnership During the Euro Crisis*. Through this chapter, he compared PPP development in Europe, noting that Italy, Spain, and the UK had advanced regulatory frameworks while France and Germany lagged with gaps, exploring how these differences affected PPP effectiveness.

Esposito's 2015 research investigated the factors contributing to public disvalue in the Italian public sector and found that effective management of mafia-seized assets transformed this disvalue into new public value. Later in 2020, he explored PPP performance evaluation, advocating Public Value theory as a comprehensive framework to assess profitability, efficiency, and sustainable development, while emphasizing the influence of performance measurement on business strategies. In the same year, he authored another paper in the *Journal of Cleaner Production*. The paper discussed integrating renewable energy into smart communities, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach that connected technical, socio-economic, and environmental factors to build sustainable, efficient energy systems with smart grids and energy sharing. More recently in 2023, he investigated how business size, complexity, and visibility affected sustainability disclosure among large European airports, finding that higher passenger numbers, cargo, terminals, gates, and social media presence boosted sustainability reporting.
