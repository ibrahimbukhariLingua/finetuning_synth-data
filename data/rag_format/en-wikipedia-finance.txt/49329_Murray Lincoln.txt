## Early life and education

Lincoln was born Murray Danforth Lincoln on April 18, 1892, and grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts. Born and raised on a small farm, Lincoln obtained his Bachelor of Science degree from Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst) in 1914. He was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.


## Career

In 1960, Lincoln headed the task force on the proposed Food for Peace Program for President elect John F. Kennedy. The task force report in 1961 urged the United States to expand its global food program and give or sell at current cut rate prices at least $3 billion worth of surplus food annually to poorer nations. In 1961, Lincoln was appointed to the Peace Corps advisory council. He was a member of the executive committee of the U.S. Committee for the United Nations, the U.N.

Lincoln helped found CARE and served as president for 12 years, from its founding in 1945 until 1957. Towards the end of 1957, Lincoln announced his plans to resign from the CARE presidency. The board of directors accepted his decision and created a new post—chairman of the board. In 1957, Lincoln became CARE's first chairman, a post he held until the end of 1966.


## Death

After a two-year illness, Lincoln died November 7, 1966, in Columbus, Ohio. The Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center at the University of Massachusetts, completed in 1970, is named in his honor.
