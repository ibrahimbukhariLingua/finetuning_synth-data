## History

In 1949, Modesta Gaisano, together with her five sons, established White Gold Department Store. After the death of Gaisano in 1981, her sons pursued their respective business interests.

Metro Retail later expanded to major cities outside Cebu. Metro stores also opened stores in key cities in Central, Western and Eastern Visayas, as well as in Central Luzon, Metro Manila and South Luzon.

The company's expansion in Metro Manila in particular was marked by the opening of Market! Market! in the early 2000s.
