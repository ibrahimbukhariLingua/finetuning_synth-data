## Internet service provider

Asahi PC Net was developed in 1988 as a service for PC communications based on the ideals of “communication” and “creation”. Functionality such as forums, virtual conference rooms and chats where users were identified by their real names were among the distinguishing features of the service. Due to collaborations with literary writers such as Yasutaka Tsutsui, and mutual integration with services such as IBM Japan's People service, Asahi PC Net became known as a humanistic network.

In 1994, the Asahi Net service was launched as an Internet connection service, and the company became a pioneer in providing service to businesses and organizations through its MMJP company website service. Currently, Asahi Net provides the largest 1 Gbit/s high speed optic fiber network, as well as ADSL, WiMAX and FOMA mobile broadband networks across Japan.
