The **economy of Hyderabad**, the capital of Telangana, India, is based on traditional manufacturing, the knowledge sector and tourism. Starting in the 1990s, the economic pattern of the city changed from a primary service hub to a more diversified economy, but the service industry still remains a major contributor.
