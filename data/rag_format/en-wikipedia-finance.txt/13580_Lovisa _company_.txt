# Lovisa (company)



**Lovisa Holdings Limited** is an Australian jewellery chain founded in Sydney in April 2010. This fast fashion jewellery brand was launched by Australian billionaire Brett Blundy, the former chairman of BB Retail Capital (BBRC). As of July 2023, Lovisa has 801 stores across 39 countries including Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, France and the United States. Lovisa also has franchised stores in the Middle East and Vietnam.


## History

Shane Fallscheer, the managing director and executive director of Lovisa partnered with Brett Blundy's private investment company BBRC in 2010 to establish this fast-fashion specialty jewellery chain. The brand concept for Lovisa was envisioned to be an extension of BBRC's existing jewellery brand, Diva.

In December 2014, Lovisa had its initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange.

Due to "poor support from landlords" during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, Lovisa exited the country in the 2020 fiscal year.

In November 2020, Lovisa announced its acquisition of part of the European retail store network of German jewellery wholesaler Beeline GmbH. The deal concerns 74 stores operating under the *Six* and *I Am* names in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and Luxembourg. The stores were rebranded as Lovisa. In December 2020, Lovisa acquired Beeline's 30 stores in France.

Following an investigation by the Labour Inspectorate in New Zealand in 2021, Lovisa had to pay NZ$153,190 in wage arrears to employees.

In January and July 2022, Lovisa employees in Belgium went on strike due to poor working conditions and pay. Employees in the Netherlands also took action in July 2022, handing out leaflets and informing customers about poor pay conditions.

In 2023, Lovisa opened a 5,000 m² (54,000 sq ft) warehouse in Poland to replace its third-party logistics service providers in the European region.

In January 2025, a class action lawsuit which involved more than 300 former Australian Lovisa employees was filed, accusing the company of underpayment and a hostile work environment.
