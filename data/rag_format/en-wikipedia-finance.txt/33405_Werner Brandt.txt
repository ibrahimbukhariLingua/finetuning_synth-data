## Industrial positions

At a conference on the future of employee ownership, which took place in Frankfurt am Main in November 2013, Brandt criticized, that the existing tax allowances in Germany, with only 360 Euro, are too low in international comparison. He pleaded for the British model with allowances that would equal around 3,500 Euro.

Brandt predicted that without a change in the tax environment in Germany the size of employee ownership would not increase, which is currently less than 1% for many companies.
