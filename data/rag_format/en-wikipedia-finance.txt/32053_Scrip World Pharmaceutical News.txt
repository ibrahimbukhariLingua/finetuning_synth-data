Scrip World Pharmaceutical News


# Scrip World Pharmaceutical News



**Scrip Intelligence (Scrip)** is an English language international pharmaceutical news, analysis and data service. First published as a weekly print newsletter in March 1972, Scrip included articles on side-effects, regulatory changes and mergers and acquisitions.


## Overview

Scrip World Pharmaceutical News was initially published by advertising company J Walter Thomson but was bought by Dr Philip J Brown in 1976 for £2000, who founded PJB Publishing. Brown sold Scrip, associated titles, and his company to Informa for £150 million in 2003.

Scrip has now developed into an online global pharma news and analysis service. It provides daily news and analysis on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry including areas such as policy & regulation, business news, research & development, generics, drug delivery, and clinical trials.

In 2022, Informa sold its Pharma Intelligence division, including *Scrip*, to Warburg Pincus. The business was renamed Citeline. Later in 2022, Citeline was acquired by Norstella.
