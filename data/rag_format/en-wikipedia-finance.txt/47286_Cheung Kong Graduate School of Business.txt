The school offers MBA, Finance MBA, Executive MBA, Business Scholars Program, and short-term Executive Education programs to both Chinese and international students.

The faculty staff is made up of 45 full-time professors and 10 long-term visiting professors currently, with research focusing from global business issues to China-specific topics. In its 10 years the school has trained about 3000 CEOs from various Chinese companies, with notable alumni including the founder of the Alibaba Group, Jack Ma; Fu Chengyu, Chairman of Sinopec; and Wu Yajun, the fifth richest person and the richest woman in China as of 2012.

Established in November 2002 through the financial support of the Li Ka Shing Foundation, today CKGSB is considered one of the major graduate business schools in China, with a leading role in the growing Chinese private sector. As of 2011 CKGSB alumni collectively managed above $1 trillion in revenues, equal to 13.7% of the Chinese GDP in that year. Headquartered in Beijing, CKGSB has campuses in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as offices in Hong Kong, New York City and London.


## School name and Logo

The "Cheung Kong" from CKGSB's name comes directly from the name of Li Ka Shing's Cheung Kong (Holdings). "Cheung Kong" in Cantonese (and "Chang Jiang" in Mandarin) is the name for China's longest river, the Yangtze River. The logo recalls the seal used by ancient Chinese scholars, and is an evocation of the school's grounding in Chinese heritage. The three vertical lines in the logo represent the ancient Chinese writing style, while the three horizontal ones indicate Western style writing, overall symbolizing the integration of Eastern and Western values and knowledge in the school. The lower right corner represents the Mandarin initials of the Yangtze River, "Chang Jiang".


## Faculty and Research

The CKGSB faculty comprises an international staff of 45 full-time professors and 10 long-term visiting professors as of 2015. Most of the faculty members are of Chinese origin, but all have pursued higher education at leading Western graduate schools, including Stanford, Harvard, Wharton and Yale. According to the school such make-up gives the faculty body a strong understanding of the Chinese market as well as a high academic profile and understanding of Western higher education practices. According to the CKGSB faculty, its per capita research publication rate in "top-tier" academic journals from 2006 to 2011 ranked 6th in the world. The school on the other hand currently adheres to a policy of not partaking in international business school rankings.
