De minimis trade rule


# De minimis trade rule



The **de minimis trade rule** permits imports of less than $800 into the United States to avoid tariff payments.


## Trump administration

During Trump 47's "first 100 days" he imposed 10% and 25% tariffs on Mexico, China, and Canada.
The White House said that the purpose of the tariffs is not so much (a) to gain more federal revenue as (b) to change the policy of the affected countries: for one thing, Trump is calling for a crackdown on deadly addictive drugs (specifically fentanyl). His strategy is to hurt U.S. trading partners enough to make them crack down on smugglers (and on migrants traveling through Mexico).

Opponents argue that the only significant effects will be (1) retaliatory tariffs and (2) higher prices for American consumers.

CNBC reported that on Feb 2, 2025, President Trump:

* . . . signed executive orders imposing tariffs on the country’s top three trading partners. Goods imported from Canada and Mexico will be slapped with a 25% tariff, while goods from China will be charged a 10% tax. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10% tariff. The duties are expected to take effect on Tuesday.
* The orders against China, Canada and Mexico all halt a trade exemption, known as “de minimis,” which allows exporters to ship packages worth less than $800 into the U.S. duty free.
