# Iskandar Malaysia



**Iskandar Malaysia** (Jawi: إسکندر مليسيا), formerly known as **Iskandar Development Region** (**IDR**; Malay: *Wilayah Pembangunan Iskandar*; Jawi: ولايه ڤمباڠونن اسكندر) and **South Johor Economic Region** (**SJER**; Malay: *Wilayah Ekonomi Johor Selatan*; Jawi: ولايه ايكونومي جوهر سلاتن), is the main southern development corridor in Johor, Malaysia. It was established on 8 November 2006.


## History

The investment corridor of Iskandar Malaysia (IM) grew out of a 2005 government requested feasibility study by the Khazanah Nasional which found that the development of such a zone would be economically, socially and developmentally beneficial. The National SJER Planning Committee (NSPC), hearing Khazanah's findings, put it in charge of developing a sustainable, holistic approach to development in the region. IM was singled out as among the high-impact developments of the Ninth Malaysia Plan, put into action by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia (Abdullah Ahmad Badawi) in March 2006 to cover the period of 2006 to 2010. In November 2006, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman and Khazanah revealed the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2007, the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Ministerial Committee for Iskandar Malaysia (JMCIM) was established to meet annually and review cooperation and developments in IM. During the 16th meeting of the JMCIM on 14 July 2023, it was announced that a task force, led by the Ministry of Trade & Industry from Singapore and Ministry of Economy from Malaysia, would be formed to study the feasibility of setting up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). Representatives of the two countries signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) on the SEZ on 11 January 2024.
