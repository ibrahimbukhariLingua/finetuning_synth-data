# DeNA



**DeNA Co., Ltd.** (Japanese: 株式会社ディー・エヌ・エー, Hepburn: *Kabushikigaisha Dī-Enu-Ē*, pronounced "DNA") is a Japanese provider of mobile portal and e-commerce websites headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo. It owns the Mobage cell phone platform and also operates other services, including the e-commerce website **DeNA Shopping** (formerly: Bidders).


## History

DeNA was founded in 1999 in Tokyo, Japan. The same year, it launched the online auction site Bidders. In 2004, it partnered with Index Corporation to launch the mobile auction site Mobaoku. A year later, the company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

In 2006, DeNA established the subsidiary Mobakore and launched the mobile gaming site Mobage Town as well as the mobile shopping site AU Shopping Mall. In 2010, it acquired the American game developer ngmoco, and a year later, it consolidated the latter's Plus+ with Mobage Town, which became known as Mobage.

In 2011, the Japan Fair Trade Commission issued a cease and desist order against DeNA, finding that it had violated Article 19 of the Antimonopoly Act by pressuring or forcing game developers to release titles only for the Mobage platform. GREE and KDDI subsequently filed suits against the company. Later that year, the company reached an agreement with TBS Holdings to purchase the professional baseball team Yokohama BayStars, which was eventually renamed Yokohama DeNA BayStars.

In 2012, DeNA announced a partnership with Disney to develop and promote social network games, including the tower defense player *Star Wars: Galactic Defense*. Later that year, the company created a partnership with the Chinese social network Renren to bring Mobage games to Chinese smartphones. Also in 2012, DeNA entered a capital and business alliance with the video game developer Cygames, whereby DeNA would acquire a total of 500 shares, or 20.03% of Cygames, for 7.4 billion yen, from its majority owner, CyberAgent.

In 2013, DeNA launched the Showroom app and browser, a live-streaming service primarily for Japanese idols and voice actors. In December, it created the Manga Box app.

In 2015, DeNA took ownership of MyAnimeList and later formed a business alliance with Nintendo.

In 2016, the company closed its U.S. subsidiary, DeNA Global, Inc., due to lagging market interest.

In 2017, DeNA established an automotive division and created the ride-hailing app "Takuberu", which operated in Kanagawa Prefecture and the city of Yokohama. A year later, it expanded the service nationwide and renamed the app "MOV".

In 2019, Media Do Holdings Co., Ltd. acquired MyAnimeList from DeNA.

In 2020, DeNA's automotive division merged with JapanTaxi Co., Ltd. and was renamed Mobility Technologies, Inc. The company had been working on its own ride-hailing app, and this was combined with "MOV" and subsequently named "GO".

In 2022, Nintendo and DeNA established a joint venture called Nintendo Systems to focus on the research and development of Nintendo accounts, with Nintendo owning 80% of the shares and DeNA owning 20%.
