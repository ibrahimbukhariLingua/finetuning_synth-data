**RSK Group** is a privately held UK-based environmental, engineering and technical services group, comprising over 175 companies employing some 10,500 people and with turnover of £1.22bn in 2023.


## History

RSK Group was established in 1989 in Aberdeen by Alan Ryder, and has grown both organically and through an accelerating programme of acquisitions. Today based in Helsby in Cheshire, it aimed to become Europe's largest privately owned environmental and engineering business with a £1 billion turnover and employing 10,000 people worldwide by 2025. RSK has acquired over 70 businesses in six years from 2016.

In the year to April 2021, RSK's turnover reached £350.5m, up from £274.8m the previous year, and made a pre-tax loss of £18.9m, having made interest payments to backers of £22.8m. In the year to April 2022, RSK made a fifth consecutive pre-tax loss, of £38.1m, on a turnover of £796m inflated due to its dozens of acquisitions. It made £39.9m in interest payments.

In August 2023, RSK announced plans to raise £500m from sales of shares in the business. Supplementing around £500m from Ares Management, this would provide £1bn to fund further acquisitions. It aimed to raise headcount to 40,000 by 2030, expanding internationally in Australia, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East.

In the year to April 2023, RSK grew its revenues over 50%, to £1.22bn. Pre-tax losses doubled to £81m, after £74m in interest payments. Founder and CEO Ryder said the group was on track to achieve £5bn revenue by 2030. By March 2024, having completed 24 further acquisitions, RSK employed 10,530 staff.

In June 2024, RSK secured £500m (and an additional £300m debt facility) to fund further strategic takeovers. The investment came from a consortium led by Searchlight Capital Partners and Ares Management Corporation funds. RSK aimed to increase turnover from £1.2bn to over £5bn by 2030, and to grow to 400 businesses.

In the year to 31 March 2024, RSK recorded a 52% increase in revenue to £1.9bn. The group reported an operating profit of £8m, but loan interest payments totalling £143m contributed to a pre-tax losses of £132m (up from a loss of £90m in 2023).
