# Gazal Corporation



**Gazal Corporation Limited** (Gazal, ASX: GZL) was a leading Australian branded clothing company and was a listed public company of the Australian Stock Exchange. The company was based in Banksmeadow in the Australian state of New South Wales. Its main business areas were men's, ladies' and children's clothing, and it and its subsidiaries are engaged in the design, manufacture, importation, wholesale and retail of clothing and accessories including business shirts, school wear, surf and casual wear, as well as intimate apparel. The company owned brands such as Mambo Graphics, Davenport and Bisley Workwear and imports brands such as Nautica, Calvin Klein Underwear and held the license for Oroton underwear. The Company had operations in Australasia and Europe. Mambo was sold to Saban Brands in 2015.


## Profile

The Gazal Group of Companies was founded in 1958 by Joe Gazal and was listed on the ASX in 1973.

In 1993, the company closed a number of its loss-making divisions, which were selling non-branded products, and decided to focus on the sale of branded products. This changed the company from a supplier of "house-brands" to a supplier of recognised national brands.

Another change of approach for the company group was primarily towards the ownership of the brands that it manufactures, markets and distributes. This is a departure from its previous policy of seeking licensing arrangements. The intention is to secure a longer term tenure and greater flexibility for brand development.

The group distributes its products through major retailers such as David Jones and Myer as well as through a range of independent retail outlets. It competes with various clothing manufacturers and distributors for the different demographics that the group targets. Trade Secret was sold to TJX in 2015.
