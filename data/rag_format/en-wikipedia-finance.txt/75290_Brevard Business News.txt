## History

Fred Krupski started *Brevard Business News* with a partner in 1981 and served as its president and publisher. Krupski, a Native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, worked in journalism for several years and helped start the *Orlando daily* before founding the *Brevard Business News*. During its early years, it was published bi-monthly, but changed to weekly. The office was originally located in Cocoa but moved to Melbourne. Ken Datzman served as the editor.

Adrienne B. Roth purchased it in 1986. Krupski continued reporting on business issues and eventually founded the *News Observer* in Titusville, Florida, where he served as the publisher.

In 1988, Central Brevard Women's Network awarded *Brevard Business News* with the Eleanor Outstanding Achievement Award for making "significant contributions to women's issues, interests and financial welfare." In 2002, the Melbourne-Palm Bay Area Chamber of Commerce recognized *Brevard Business News* for contributions in media to the "public and the business community" at the 17th-annual Business Achievement Awards.
