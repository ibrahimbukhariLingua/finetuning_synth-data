# Macquarie Business School



**Macquarie Business School** (MQBS) is a constituent body of Macquarie University, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

MQBS is a business school originally established as the Faculty of Business and Economics. The School is the focal point for all business, management, economics research and education at Macquarie University.


## History of Macquarie Business School

Macquarie Business School began life as the Centre for Management Studies (CMS) within the school of Economic and Financial Studies at North Ryde, Sydney, Australia in 1969. CMS began offering a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration in 1970 and in 1972 it offered a three-year, part-time Master of Business Administration (MBA). In early 1980, CMS developed its own identity as the Graduate School of Management (GMS); it remained within the School of Economic and Financial Studies.

In the mid-1980s the GSM Advisory board recommended GSM should have a separate identity and its own separate dedicated teaching facility. Funds were raised to build the campus from the late 1980s and during the 1990s.

GSM moved to a 40-week teaching term, four-term year in 1989â€“1990 and this enabled the development of a 16-unit MBA which could be completed in two years' part-time. Master of Arts programmes were developed and later replaced by Master of Management programmes. GSM went offshore and began delivering programmes in Singapore in 1992 and in Hong Kong in 1994.

Until 1998, MGSM consisted of two institutions, the GSM and MGSM. At this time the board decided to integrate the school and the new entity became known as MGSM.

The Sydney CBD campus was opened in 2000. MGSM launched its Online Interactive Study option in Term one of 2013.

In early 2009, the Deputy Vice Chancellor Macquarie University undertook a major review process of MGSM which decided that the school should retain its autonomy. A later review merged the MGSM into the Macquarie Business School from 2019.
