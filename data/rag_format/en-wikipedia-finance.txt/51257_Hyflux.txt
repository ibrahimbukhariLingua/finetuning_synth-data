## History

The company started initially as Hydrochem (S) Pte Ltd in 1989 with a start-up capital of S$20,000 and three staff, selling water treatment systems.

By January 2001, Hyflux had become the first water treatment company to be listed on SESDAQ, and was upgraded to the Singapore Exchange's Mainboard in April 2003.

In 2008, the group had net profits of S$59 million. In 2016, the group had net profits of S$3.8 million.

On 21 May 2018, the company suspended its shares and applied for court supervision to reorganise liabilities and businesses the next day.

On 19 October 2018, conglomerate Salim Group and energy giant Medco Group agreed to offer Hyflux a S$400 million equity injection, in exchange for a 60 per cent stake in the company once it has settled all its debts.

On 4 June 2021, judicial managers filed an application with Singapore's court to wind up the company after failed negotiations with an investor.

On 21 July 2021, Singapore's high court has approved for Hyflux to wind up and be liquidated with its judicial managers being its liquidators.
