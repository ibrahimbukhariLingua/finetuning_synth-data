Joint law venture


# Joint law venture



In Singapore law, a **joint law venture** (**JLV**) is a law firm joint venture formed from a constituent local law firm and an offshore counterpart.


## History

The first JLVs were licensed on 10 August 2000. Of the seven partnerships, all but one have since dissolved. The frequent failures of JLVs have led to criticism of the Singapore government's conceptualisation and implementation of the JLV.
