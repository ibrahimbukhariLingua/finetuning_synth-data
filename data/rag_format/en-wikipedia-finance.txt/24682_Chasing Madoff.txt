## Summary

The film chronicles how Harry Markopolos and his associates spent ten years trying to get the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and others to acknowledge and act on their investigative proof of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, which scammed an estimated $18 billion, or $65 billion including fake returns, from investors. Despite a series of meetings over a number of years, the SEC ignored Markopolos and his associates or only gave the evidence a cursory investigation.
