# Comic-Finance



*Le* ***Comic-Finance*** was a French illustrated satirical and financial weekly newspaper, published in Paris, France from 1868 to 1937. It was edited from 1868 to 1911 by Ernest Schrameck (1844–1911), who wrote under the pseudonym "Sergines".

*Comic-Finance* was published weekly, on Thursdays. It included humorous articles, and caricatures of prominent businessmen, as well as serious news articles on financial matters.

Some of the illustrated biographical pieces published in *Comic-Finance* were republished in bound volumes by its editor-in-chief (Sergines, *Silhouettes financières*, 4 volumes, Paris, 1872–1874).

In 1877, *Comic-Finance'*s circulation was estimated at 1,000 copies according to a police report.

One of the newspaper's main contributors was Edmond Benjamin. In 1879, he left *Comic-Finance* to found *La Finance pour rire*, whose banner and thumbnails were illustrated by another former contributor to *Comic-Finance*, the designer E Doré.

Publication of *Comic-Finance* was temporarily interrupted during the Franco-German War of 1870, the Paris Commune in 1871 and the First World War (1914–18). It appeared fortnightly or monthly from 1920 until 1937, when it ceased publication.
