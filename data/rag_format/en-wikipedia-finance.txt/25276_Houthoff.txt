## History

Houthoff was founded in 1970 in Amsterdam by merging three existing law firms. With twelve partners and three interns, it became the largest law firm in the Netherlands at the time. The location chosen was the Museumplein.

The firm is named after Mr. Henri Louis Houthoff (1910-1997), one of the lawyers from the three firms. He lived with his wife at the estate Trompenburgh in 's-Graveland, where disputes between the partners were resolved.

In the early 21st century, Houthoff merged with the law firm Buruma Maris and changed its name to Houthoff Buruma. In October 2017, Buruma was removed from the name, arguing that "the long name is difficult to pronounce for international clients and in other languages.
