National Council on Privatisation


# National Council on Privatisation



The **National Council on Privatization (NCP)** is a think tank sponsored by the Nigerian government to determine the political, economic and social objectives of the privatization and commercialization of Nigeria's public enterprises.

Major roads in Nigeria are posted with billboards sponsored by the National Council on Privatisation saying that " the people benefit as the nation privatises".

In Nigeria, there have been some pockets of opposition to the ongoing privatization process. Workers of some of the affected companies are rearing opposition to the privatization. This especially includes the NITEL and NEPA employees.
