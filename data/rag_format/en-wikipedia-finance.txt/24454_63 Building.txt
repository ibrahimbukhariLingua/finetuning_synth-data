63 Building


# 63 Building



The **63 Building** (Korean: 63빌딩; RR: *Yuksam Building*), officially called **63 SQUARE** (formerly **Hanwha 63 City**), is a skyscraper on the island of Yeouido, overlooking the Han River in Seoul, South Korea. At 249.6 m (819 ft) high, it was the tallest building outside North America when it was opened on July 27, 1985, and it is the second-tallest gold-clad building in the world after Grand Lisboa in Macau. It stood as South Korea's tallest building until the Hyperion Tower surpassed it in 2003, but remained the country's tallest commercial building until the Northeast Asia Trade Tower was topped-out in 2009.

The 63 Building was built as a landmark for the 1988 Summer Olympics. *63* is something of a misnomer since only 60 floors are above ground level. Floors 61–63 are restricted areas. The skyscraper is the headquarters of Korea Life Insurance, Industrial Bank of Korea Securities, and other major financial companies.

The design of the structure is based on the Hanja character for person or human being (人 or *in*) in a subtle reference by the designers to the business of Daehan Life, the insurance company that constructed the building.


## History


### Construction

The 63 Building's construction broke ground in February 1980, at the height of South Korea's economic boom. It was built at a cost of 180 billion won, and construction was completed in May 1985. It was originally named the DLI 63 building, for Daehan Life Insurance. In 2000, Hanwha Group renamed the building 63 City and it became part of the group in 2002.


### 63 Building and Present

It was temporarily opened on July 5, 1985, and the completion ceremony was fully opened on July 27, the same year, and was held on September 30. It was the tallest building in the world when excluding North America, beating the Sunshine 60 building in Tokyo, Japan at the time of its completion, before the OUB centre was built in Singapore in 1987 and the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong in 1990. During the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the torch was lit at the Bonghwadae in front of the 63 Building, and it became famous around the world. Originally, it was the headquarters of Korea Life Insurance of Shindonga Group, but it was dismantled in 1997 due to the IMF, and the 63 Building was moved to Hanwha Group. The Seoul International Fireworks Festival began in 2000 and was canceled in 2001 in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, and the event dates were adjusted in consideration of the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup. It has been designated as an official World Cup cultural event. The 63 Building was also owned by Hanwha Group when Korea Life Insurance (currently Hanwha Life Insurance) was acquired and incorporated into Hanwha Group in September.ʷʰᵉⁿ?
