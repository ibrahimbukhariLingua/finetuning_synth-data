# Pinduoduo



**Pinduoduo** (Chinese: 拼多多; pinyin: *Pīnduōduō*) is a Chinese online retailer with a focus on the traditional agriculture industry. The business is the largest product of **PDD Holdings**, which also owns the online marketplace Temu.


## History

Pinduoduo was founded in 2015 by Chinese businessman and software engineer Colin Huang and initially focused on the agriculture industry. It developed at a time when Alibaba and JD had significantly consolidated the Chinese e-commerce market and many analysts believed there was limited room for new market entrants.⁴⁵

On 7 June 2018, *Legal Evening News* reported that Pinduoduo investigated and shut down stores and removed listings that violated its platform policy against pornography and violence, following an earlier report by the newspaper.

On 20 January 2019, Pinduoduo reported to the police theft by hackers that exploited a loophole in their system and stole tens of millions of Yuan worth of vouchers.

During the initial COVID-19 lockdown in China in 2020, Pinduoduo started a program to assist rural Chinese farmers with selling their produce to customers online instead of relying on traditional in-person marketplaces. In August 2020, Pinduoduo launched Duo Duo Maicai, a service which enables consumers to preorder groceries for pickup at designated locations.

Pinduoduo generated RMB 4.17 trillion (US$590 billion) gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2021.

In September 2022, Pinduoduo's sister's company, Temu, was launched in the U.S. by PDD Holdings.

In 2023, PDD Holdings changed its legal domicile from Shanghai to Dublin.


## Criticism


### Counterfeit products

Pinduoduo has been significantly criticised in domestic Chinese media for selling *shanzhai* products.³⁴ The company responded with an open letter stating that it had, in a single week in August, shut down 1,128 stores, taken down more than 4 million listings, and blocked 450,000 suspected counterfeit goods listings from being published.

After it was listed on the U.S. Nasdaq stock exchange in 2018, China's State Administration for Market Regulation announced probes into the firm based on reports of counterfeit materials available on the platform.³⁴ Pinduoduo responded by intensifying efforts to remove counterfeit materials from its store.²⁰⁸ According to the company, it removed over 10.7 million suspicious items and blocked 40 million suspicious links on its platforms.²⁰⁸ Pinduoduo sought to reassure customers by stating that it would compensate customers with ten times the value of any counterfeit item found to have been sold through the platform.²⁰⁸ This was three times as much as the compensation mandated by China's Consumer Protection Law.²⁰⁸

Pinduoduo also introduced a penalty on sellers of items under which it would freeze ten times the trading volume of any item found to be counterfeit.²⁰⁸ One thousand sellers responded with a protest in July 2018 at the company's headquarters, during which there were physical clashes with the company's security guards.²⁰⁸ Sellers have also challenged Pinduoduo's penalty in court, but as of at least 2021 Pinduoduo won a significant majority of these cases.²⁰⁸

In April 2019, Pinduoduo was first named in the Office of the United States Trade Representative's list of Notorious Markets for Counterfeit Products and Piracy. As of 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Pinduoduo remains listed as a notorious market.

The company also disclosed that it had removed 500,715 items and closed more than 40 stores as of February 4, 2020, to protect consumers from counterfeit and substandard masks being sold by merchants hoping to profit amid the COVID-19 pandemic.


### Malware concerns

In 2023, Google removed Pinduoduo's app from the Play Store after a Chinese cybersecurity firm found malware in app versions carried in Chinese app stores. Two days after releasing an update to address concerns, Pinduoduo disbanded the team of engineers and product managers who had developed the exploits. A majority of the team was transferred to Temu, working in various departments.

Six cybersecurity teams interviewed by CNN – including Finnish, Russian, US, and Israeli firms – as well as Chinese cybersecurity firm DarkNavy, all labeled Pinduoduo as malware or potential malware. In a report by Bloomberg News, a researcher from Kaspersky Labs stated the following: "Some versions of the Pinduoduo app contained malicious code, which exploited known Android vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, download and execute additional malicious modules, some of which also gained access to users' notifications and files".

Pinduoduo maintains a data sharing agreement with a unit of the *People's Daily*, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.


### Non-compete agreements

In 2024, the *Financial Times* and *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Pinduoduo sued several former employees for violating non-compete clauses. The evidence Pinduoduo submitted to court includes video recordings of the former employees going to work for Pinduoduo's rivals. The company said it does not "engage in any illegal or unethical surveillance practices of current or former employees."
