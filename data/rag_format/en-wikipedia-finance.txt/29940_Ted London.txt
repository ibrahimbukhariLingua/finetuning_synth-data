# Ted London



**Ted London** is an American scholar and teacher on Base of the Pyramid (BoP) business strategies. He is the Ford Motor Company Clinical Professor of Business Administration at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. London is an internationally recognized expert on the intersection of business strategy and poverty alleviation. In 2016 London authored *The Base of the Pyramid Promise: Building Businesses with Impact and Scale*, which translates over 25 years of research and experience into actionable strategies, frameworks, and tools for managers seeking inclusive growth. The book won the Responsible Research in Management Award in 2018 and the Humanistic Management Book Award in 2019.


## Academic experience and research

London's research focuses on how organizations can achieve impact at scale with a particular focus on building sustainable enterprises in low-income markets. His work has been published in academic and practitioner journals, as well as in books and book chapters.

In 2009, London published "Making Better Investments at the Base of the Pyramid" in the *Harvard Business Review*. This article addresses how companies can build a value creation strategy that is based on alleviating poverty. In 2010, *Next Generation Business Strategies for the Base of the Pyramid: New Approaches for Building Mutual Value* was published. Co-edited by London and Stuart Hart, authors included Jacqueline Novogratz, Allen Hammond, Robert Kennedy, Erik Simanis, Madhu Viswanathan, and Patrick Whitney. This book was dedicated to the late C.K. Prahalad.

At the Academy of Management in 2010, London won the Samsung Best Paper Award and Doug Nigh Award. These awards recognized London's research on business model innovation in BoP markets. In 2012, Ross School of Business colleagues London and Ravi Anupindi published "Using the base-of-the-pyramid perspective to catalyze interdependence-based collaborations" in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This article argues that for both donor- and enterprise-led value chain initiatives to be simultaneously scalable and sustainable, a BoP perspective must be taken so that development and business efforts are better integrated. The article's research was funded by USAID and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

In 2016, London was awarded the Aspen Institute's Faculty Pioneer Award. He was also recognized with a special distinction for fielding building, which acknowledges his long-standing contributions to development of inclusive business and how it is taught in the classroom. London's teaching was also recognized when he won the 2011 Page Prize for his course, *Business Strategies for the Base of the Pyramid*. He also won the oikos Sustainability Case Writing Competition in 2005 and 2008.

In 2021, he received the Victor Bernard Teaching Award for his contributions to teaching at the Ross School of Business.

While London's research has been well-cited, there are also critics of his work and that of other scholars in the BoP domain. Aneel Karnani, a colleague of London's at the Ross School of Business, has suggested that enterprises serving the BoP can do more harm than good. Erik Simanis, who was a doctoral student with London at the University of North Carolina and later received his PhD from Cornell University, has questioned the potential for profitability in BoP markets.
