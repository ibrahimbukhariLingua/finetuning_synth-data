## History

In 1991, entrepreneurs Craig Underwood, Sam Duboc, and Rob Gierkink began planning a coalition loyalty program, involving partners drawn from retail and financial services sectors.

In 1998, Alliance Data acquired Loyalty Management Group Canada Inc., parent company of the AIR MILES program, and in 2008 renamed it LoyaltyOne.

### Air Miles

Air Miles is a Canadian rewards program, with over 11 million active collector accounts within approximately two-thirds of all Canadian households. Cash Rewards or Dream Rewards are redeemable with hundreds of rewards partners across Canada.


#### 2016 points expiry issue

In 2011 Air Miles Canada announced that all points would expire with no compensation to its members after 5 years of being issued. In 2016 with months before the January 1st 2017 deadline was about to be enacted, Canadian news media began to heavily report on the impending deadline with stories of Canadian's struggling to redeem their long collected points. Members who redeemed the points fearing their loss were then outraged about having used up their collected points needlessly. Customers complained that they 'wasted' points on things they didn't want in fear of losing all the points that had been collected.

On December 1, 2016 Air Miles reversed their decision to expire members points, and cited that legislation that is about to be passed in Ontario that forbids the expiration of points would create problems in managing the program with various rules in each Province. In a statement release announcing the about face changes LoyaltyOne promised to ensure that they will still find a way to keep the rewards program profitable: "Going forward, LoyaltyOne will adjust the value proposition to collectors to offset the lost economics … and to maintain, as closely as possible, the economics of the Air Miles reward program prior to cancellation of the expiry policy"
A proposed Class Action lawsuit was launched in Alberta.

On October 31, 2017, BrandSpark announces Air Miles as the most trusted brand in Loyalty Program category.
