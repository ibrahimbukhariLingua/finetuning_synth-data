## History

Global Fashion Group (GFG) was established in 2014 through a consolidation of fashion e-commerce regional companies backed by Kinnevik and Rocket Internet. Its regional companies Dafiti, Lamoda, The Iconic, Zalora and Jabong (later sold) were founded in 2011 and 2012.

In 2011 and 2012, the GFG regional companies began operations with a business model of selling inventory to customers from its warehouses.
