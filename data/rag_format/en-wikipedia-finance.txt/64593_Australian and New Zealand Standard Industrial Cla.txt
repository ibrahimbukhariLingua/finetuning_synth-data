Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification


# Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification



**Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification** (**ANZSIC**) was jointly developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Statistics New Zealand in order to make it easier to compare industry statistics between the two countries and with the rest of the world.

The 2006 edition of the ANZSIC replaced the 1993 edition, which was the first version produced. Prior to 1993, Australia and New Zealand had separate industry classifications. It is arranged into 19 broad industry divisions and 96 industry subdivisions There are two more detailed levels called Groups and Classes. ANZSIC codes are four-digit numbers. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) uses five-digit codes referred to as Business Industry Codes.

In the 2006 edition, Industry Division D has been expanded to include 'Waste Services', and 'hunting' is removed from Industry Division A.
