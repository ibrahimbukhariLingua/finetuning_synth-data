## Etymology

The word *crore* derives from the Prakrit word *kroḍi*, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit *koṭi* (कोटि), denoting ten million in the Indian number system, which has separate terms for most powers of ten from 10⁰ up to 10¹⁹. The *crore* is known by various regional names.


## Money

Large amounts of money in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan are often written in terms of *crore*. For example 150,000,000 (one hundred and fifty million) rupees is written as "fifteen *crore* rupees", "₹15 crore". In the abbreviated form, usage such as "₹15 cr" is common.

Trillions (in the short scale) of money are often written or spoken of in terms of *lakh crore*. For example, *one trillion rupees* is equivalent to:
