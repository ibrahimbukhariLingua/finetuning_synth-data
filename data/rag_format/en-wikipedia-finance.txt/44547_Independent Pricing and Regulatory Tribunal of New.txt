Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales


# Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales



The **Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal of New South Wales** (**IPART**) is an independent regulatory and pricing tribunal that oversees regulation in water, gas, electricity and transport industries in the Australian state of New South Wales. It was established in 1992 by Government of New South Wales to regulate the maximum prices for monopoly services by government utilities and other monopoly businesses, such as public transport.

IPART's organisational arm or Secretariat is managed by its chief executive officer. It has about 140 staff members and an annual budget of A$25 million. Peter Boxall is its current chairperson. IPART reports to the Premier of New South Wales.

IPART's role is defined by several state legislative acts, including the *Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal Act 1992*, the *Gas Supply Act 1996*, the *Electricity Supply Act 1995*, the *National Electricity (NSW) Law 1997*, and the *Transport Administration Act 1996*.

* Set maximum prices for monopoly services provided by government agencies in NSW (including water and public transport).
* Administer licensing or authorisation of water, electricity and gas businesses, and monitor compliance with licence conditions.
* Advise the NSW Government or its agencies on issues such as pricing, efficiency, industry structure and competition.
* Regulate maximum electricity and gas prices that regulated energy retailers can charge to residential and small business customers.
