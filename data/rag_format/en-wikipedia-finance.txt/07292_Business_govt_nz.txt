## Background

The previous government business site, biz.org.nz, was launched in 2003. Business.govt.nz replaced it on 15 August 2007. The site was originally developed by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in consultation with a range of government departments and ministries, business groups and business service providers.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2014, business.govt.nz adopted a policy of customer-centred design and delivery, developing new products in partnership with designers and small businesses and testing ideas, concepts and prototypes with small businesses. At the same time continuous business improvement practices were implemented.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
