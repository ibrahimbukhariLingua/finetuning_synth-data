## History

CEC traces its origin to a company that was called Northern Rhodesia Power Corporation established in 1952. In or around 1954, the company became the Rhodesia-Congo Border Power Corporation whose purpose was to supply reliable and secure electricity to the mines in Northern Rhodesia and the Congo by interconnecting separately run thermal power stations in the mining areas. Later, the company sourced and supplied hydroelectric power from the Congo to supply to the mines in Northern Rhodesia before the production of hydroelectricity from the Kariba Dam.

At Zambia’s independence in 1964, the Rhodesia-Congo Border Power Corporation became Copperbelt Power Company (CPC), an entity that supplied electricity to the mines until 1986 when it was incorporated into the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) as its Power Division.

In 1997, CEC was born out of the privatization of ZCCM - Power Division. Cinergy Global Power of the US and National Grid of the UK acquired the controlling stake in the company.

The two investors subsequently sold off their 77 per cent stake in the company to a group of local entrepreneurs. In January 2008, CEC became Zambia’s first power utility to list on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) and remains the only one as of 2015.

In 2013 CEC expanded its operations into Nigeria by taking a 75% stake in KANN Utility which in turn owns 60% of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company. In 2013 the company purchased a 20% share of North South Power Limited which has a 30-year concession to operate the 600MW Shiroro hydro power plant in Niger State.
