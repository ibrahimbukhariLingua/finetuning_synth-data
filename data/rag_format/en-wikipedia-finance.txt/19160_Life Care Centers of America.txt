### Medicare fraud

In 2016, Life Care agreed to pay $145 million to resolve allegations of over-billing the government for unnecessary or unreasonable rehabilitation services in violation of the False Claims Act. Between January 1, 2006, and February 28, 2013, Life Care submitted fraudulent claims for rehabilitation therapy by engaging in a systematic effort to increase its Medicare and Tricare billings. It was the largest settlement with a skilled nursing facility chain in DOJ history. The suit combined complaints by two separate whistleblowers under the *qui tam* provision of the Act.
