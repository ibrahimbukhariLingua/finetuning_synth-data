# October 2022 Australian federal budget



The **October 2022 Australian federal budget** was the federal budget to fund government services and operations. The budget was presented to the House of Representatives by Treasurer Jim Chalmers on 25 October 2022. It was the first budget to be handed down by the Australian Labor Party since their election to government at the 2022 federal election. It was the second budget to be handed down in 2022, with the preceding budget being delivered in March by the prior government.


## Background

The budget was handed down during a period of high inflation. The consumer price index had risen to 7.3% over the past year, the highest since June 1990.

Before the budget was delivered the Treasurer was cautioning the state of the global economy. He warned our key trading partners faced the risk of recession.

The budget featured a new set of well-being measures. The initiative provides the framework that measures and reports on the quality of life for Australians, beyond the indicators of financial prosperity. The plan is to introduce targets next year.


## Forecasts

Australia’s gross domestic product is expected to grow 3.25% this financial year, dropping to 1.5% in the following financial year. This is the lowest since the early 1990s recession, aside for the drop in growth during the pandemic.


### Revenues

Total government revenue is $644 billion this financial year. Government revenues were $57.3 billion better than last predicted in the March budget. The cause is higher company taxes generated by resource exports. The increased price of energy is a windfall for energy exporters.

$720 million is expected to be raised after a "crackdown on large companies using related-party debts to artificially reduce their local profits and tax bills".
