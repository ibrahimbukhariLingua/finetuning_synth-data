### Rail privatization bid

Following the Greek government-debt crisis, GEK Terna showed interest in the planned privatization of Greek state-owned railway carrier TrainOSE. Together with the state-owned railway companies of Russia and France, RZD and SNCF, and Romanian private railway carrier Grup Feroviar Roman, it placed a joint bid for TrainOSE and the Hellenic Company for Rolling Stock Maintenance (Rosco), currently held by the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund. Following the January 2015 legislative election, the new SYRIZA-led administration however put the decision under review.
