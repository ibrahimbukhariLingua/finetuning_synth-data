**Greg Green** is a businessman and entrepreneur based in the Spokane-area, who began his career in the telecommunications industry in the mid-1980s. He is the founder of Tel-West.


## Telecommunications industry beginnings

Green began his technology industry ventures when he formed Tel-West, a telecommunications provider of telecommunications services (a competitive access provider), in 1984. In 1995, Tel-West was acquired by NEXTLINK, an organization owned by Craig McCaw. Green was an early pioneer of competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs, after the Telecommunications Act of 1996. As President of NEXTLINK Washington, which later became Communications, Green was a member of the senior management team that took NEXTLINK public and raising $400 million in 1997.

After spending three more years with NEXTLINK, Green left in 1998 to found a new company, OneEighty Communications. OneEighty Communications was founded in an effort to bring telecom services to underserved markets with populations of less than 500,000. Avista Corporation saw the value in it and purchased a majority share 6 months after Green founded the company. It was later renamed Avista Communications. Green remained with Avista Communications as its president and CEO until Avista Corp decided to sell the telecom section of its company in 2001.

He continued his work in the telecom industry by purchasing CLEC assets in the Northwest from Avista Communications. Those were later sold to Eschelon Telecom now a part of Integra Telecom.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Advocacy

In March 2019, Green advocated for Net Neutrality during a hearing of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. During the hearing Green stated that, “In a lot of marketplaces, 70 percent of consumers only have one choice for their ISP,” he said. “We don’t believe that’s open access. People need competition, they need a landscape they can count on and investment in their own community.”


## Philanthropy

In the early 1990s, Green founded the Greg Green Foundation. The aim of this organization has been to aid communities and students in times of financial need. Over $600,000 has been donated since the foundation has started.
