Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois


# Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v. Illinois



***Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Company v. Illinois***, 118 U.S. 557 (1886), also known as the **Wabash Case**, was a Supreme Court decision that severely limited the rights of states to control or impede interstate commerce. It led to the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.


## The court

The majority's opinion was written by Justice Samuel Miller; joining him were associate justices Stephen Field, John Harlan, William Woods, Stanley Matthews, and Samuel Blatchford. Dissenting were Chief Justice Morrison Waite and associate justices Joseph Bradley and Horace Gray.


## The case

The case was argued on April 14, 1886 - April 15, 1886 and was decided on October 25, 1886, by vote of 6 to 3. Associate Justice Miller wrote for the Court with Associate Justices Field, Harlan, Woods, Matthews, and Blatchford concurring; Associate Justices Bradley and Gray, along with Chief Justice Waite, dissented.

In *Wabash*, "direct" burdens on interstate commerce were not permitted by the Export Tax Clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 9); however, those "indirect" burdens were permitted under the Commerce Clause. This was a standard enacted in *Cooley v. Board of Wardens* (1852).


## Effects of decision

* The *Wabash* decision led to the creation in 1887 of the first modern regulatory agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission.
* It clarified the "direct" v. "indirect" test (though this doctrine was abandoned in the 1930s).
* It was one of the first instances in government assuming responsibility for economic affairs that had previously been delegated to the states.
