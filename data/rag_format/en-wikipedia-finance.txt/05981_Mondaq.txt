## Background

Mondaq is a content aggregator that organizes and publishes curated content from professional advisers, such as law firms and financial institutions. Mondaq provides information on topics such as employment, tax, litigation, healthcare, government, and real estate. By 2008, Mondaq was one of three main services in the aggregation market, along with Lexology, and Linex Legal—"mining" law firm publications for information and republishing the results. These three had the "broadest coverage" at that time. By 2017, Mondaq was still recommended along with Lexology and JD Supra among the top three Law Firm Newsletter Aggregators.

The company’s Thought Leadership Award aims to recognize the most popular articles and blogs, measured by total readership, over a six-month period of time. Articles are chosen from a wide variety of topics across 17 different countries.
