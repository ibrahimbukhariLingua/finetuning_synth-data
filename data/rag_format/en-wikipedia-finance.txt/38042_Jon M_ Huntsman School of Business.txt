Jon M. Huntsman School of Business


# Jon M. Huntsman School of Business



The **Jon M. Huntsman School of Business** is located at Utah State University in Logan, Utah.


## History

The business school was founded in 1888 as the college's Commercial Department. The first students graduated from the course in 1894 when the only four-year business school was the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

The program underwent several organizational revisions and name changes in its first two decades. By 1911, the program (then named School of Commerce) was already recognized as a leading business institution. A 1911 newspaper report about the economics department said:

> When so eminent an authority as professor L. C. Marshall of the University of Chicago reports that the work in the department of economics of our school is comparable to that given in the best institutions in the country, we feel that we are paid one of the highest tributes ever. ... In the number of hours instruction given, the number of students in the courses, and the general standard of the courses, we are surpassed by only a very few of the large universities.

In 1918, the school became known as the School of Commerce and Business Administration. At that time, the school included five departments: markets, business administration, accounting, political science, and history. Other majors continued to be added over time.

In 1952, under the direction of Professor C. D. McBride, the Management Institute came into existence. Utah's economy was rapidly shifting from agriculture to business, and Utah State University, as the land-grant institution in Utah, had an obligation to provide educational services in business and industry throughout Utah comparable to those offered in agriculture and rural life through the Cooperative Extension Service. The Management Institute was in charge of providing educational services for businesses.

By 1957, the School of Commerce and Business Administration had become the College of Business and Social Sciences, with M. R. Merrill as dean. Three of the four departments were strictly social science: history and political science, economics, and sociology. In 1959, Robert P. Collier became acting dean. The college included the departments of business administration and secretarial science, history and political science, sociology and social work, and economics.

By 1966, business courses were taught in more than a dozen buildings on campus. Accounting, which had enjoyed department status early in the college's history but had been under business administration for many years, became a separate department again—in addition to the accounting department, the College of Business included six other departments, including the Division of Military Science and Aerospace Studies.

The time had come for the college to have its own building. The Utah Building Board approved a $600,000 federal grant for a business building, and on Jan. 11, 1967, the schematic plans for the building were approved by the USU Board of Trustees. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on Dec. 10, 1968, with a projected cost of $1,591,700 for the structure. On May 8, 1970, the building was dedicated as the George S. Eccles Business Building.

The Eccles Building is nine stories high. Its original design included a three-story classroom base and six additional stories of faculty offices, seminar rooms, and other facilities. The building has since undergone multiple renovations.

The College of Business's undergraduate program was accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) in 1971, and the graduate (master's) program was accredited by the AACSB in 1981.

In February 1983, the Department of Accounting became the School of Accountancy. By 1986, the College of Business had a full-time enrollment of approximately 1,398 students in its undergraduate and graduate programs (Self-Study Report, 1986). Thirty-nine full-time and 32 part-time faculty were employed in three departments: business administration, administrative systems and business education, and accounting. The Department of Economics remained under the joint administration of the Colleges of Business and Agriculture.

In 2007, Utah State's College of Business became the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business after a $26 million donation by the Huntsman Foundation.

On March 16, 2016, Jon M. Huntsman Hall was dedicated and opened. The building is a 125,000-square-foot student-centered facility with 21 classrooms, 21 meeting spaces, faculty/administration offices, and event spaces.

On May 6, 2017, the Huntsman School announced a joint $50 million gift from the Huntsman Foundation and the Charles Koch Foundation, the largest in the school's history.

The Stephen R. Covey Leadership Center was established on November 2, 2018. Its purpose is to develop principle-centered leaders.

As of 2019, the Huntsman School offers seven undergraduate majors and six graduate programs.


## Location

The George S. Eccles Business Building underwent a major renovation in 2008, made possible by a $1 million grant from the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation.

In 2011, the Utah Legislature approved funding for a new business building, Jon M. Huntsman Hall, located southwest of the Eccles Business Building. The building was funded by $36 million in private funds and $14 million in state funds. The 125,000-square-foot building includes 21 classrooms, 21 student meeting rooms, office spaces, and multiple event spaces.

## Controversy

On November 13, 2017, The Utah Statesman published an article about the college secretly spending differential tuition without the permission of an advisory board, an amount totaling more than $8 million annually. At the Huntsman School of Business, students are required to pay $2,000+ more annually than other students at Utah State University, but these business students were told they get a voice in how that money will be spent. That voice would be the 3-5 students on the Advisory Board. But the board had never met, and when Business Senator Nadir Tekarli (student) tried to get the board to meet, he was met with problems from the administration. Due to the backlash following *The Utah Statesman* publication, the administration caved and had its first Advisory Board meeting. The *Salt Lake Tribune has also covered this story*.
