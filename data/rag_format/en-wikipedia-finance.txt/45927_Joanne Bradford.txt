## Career

Bradford's early career began at BusinessWeek and then Microsoft, where she led sales and product marketing for MSN and AdCenter.

In March 2008, she left Microsoft to become Executive Vice President of National Marketing Services at the ad agency Spot Runner, a much smaller start up company, where she worked for six months before joining Yahoo! in the fall of 2008 as Senior Vice President of US Revenue and Market Development, heading up sales.

Two years later, she became Chief Revenue Officer at Demand Media, marking her second move from a large company to a much smaller startup. This transition was controversial, as it was announced in the press before she informed her colleagues at Yahoo! that she was leaving.

After a brief tenure as President of the San Francisco Chronicle, Bradford joined Pinterest in 2013, where she led early monetization efforts. She left Pinterest in early 2015 following a management reshuffle, having declined an offer to move to another role as Head of Direct Sales.

Later that year, she joined lender SoFi as Chief Operating Officer. During her time at the company, she was responsible for raising SoFi's profile as a leading fintech brand.

InJune 2019, Bradford departed SoFi alongside two other executives, Kevin Moss and Ashish Jain, marking a significant moment for the company shortly after new CEO Anthony Noto joined in 2018.

Following her departure from SoFi, she took up the role of president at Honey, a financial start up centered around automating access to discounts and the best online deals, in August 2019. In 2021, Bradford was named the chief growth officer of MNTN, an advertising technology company.

Bradford has been a member of the executive board of a number of organisations, including Wave, OneLogin, Comscore, and the anti-poverty charity CARE.
