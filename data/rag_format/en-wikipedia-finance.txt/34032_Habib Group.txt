## History

Habib Group was established in 1947 by Habib Ullah Mia as Habib Trading, a consumer goods trading company. It was inherited by his three sons, Mahbub Ali, Yakub Ali, and Yasin Ali, in 1981 who expanded the business in other areas such as garments.

In 2009, Habib Group sponsored the Port City League Twenty20 championship in Chittagong. Regent Power Limited launched a 24 megawatt powerplant in Sitakunda Upazila in May.

In 2010, Habib Group launched Regent Airways. Mashruf Habib was the managing director of Regent Airways and Imran Asif was the chief executive officer. Salman Habib was the deputy managing director. Its first route was Dhaka to Chittagong and it started with two De Havilland Canada Dash 8. Habib Group had a turnover of 20 billion BDT a year.

In June 2017, Regent Airways announced plans to expand destinations in the Middle East and the purchase of three Boeing 737.

Regent Airways was financially hit during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh along with other airlines in 2020 after travel was restricted and flights were forced to cancel. It cancelled the lease of two Boeing 737 to save costs. The airline had 1.89 billion due to Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh.

In May, textile workers of Regent Textile Mills Limited protested in Chittagong demanding their unpaid wages.
