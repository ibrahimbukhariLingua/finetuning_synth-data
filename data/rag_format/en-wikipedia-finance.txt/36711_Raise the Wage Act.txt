Raise the Wage Act


# Raise the Wage Act



The **Raise the Wage Act** is a proposed United States law that would increase the federal minimum wage to US$17. Versions of the bill have been introduced in each United States Congress since 2017.


## Background


### Federal Minimum Wage

The minimum wage in the United States is set by U.S. labor law and a range of state and local laws. The first federal minimum wage was created as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but declared unconstitutional. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act established it at $0.25 an hour ($5.19 in 2022 dollars). Its purchasing power peaked in 1968 at $1.60 ($13.46 in 2022 dollars). The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 has set the minimum wage at $7.25 per hour since 2009. The real value of the federal minimum wage in 2022 dollars has decreased by 46% since its inflation-adjusted peak in February 1968.


## Provisions


### Minimum Wage Increases

The most recently introduced bill would gradually increase the minimum wage over the 5 years following the bill's passage and ultimately eliminate sub-minimum wages for tipped, disabled, and youth workers. Additionally, once wages reach $17.00/hr, the minimum wage will be pegged to median wage growth so as to prevent the value of the minimum wage from decreasing.
