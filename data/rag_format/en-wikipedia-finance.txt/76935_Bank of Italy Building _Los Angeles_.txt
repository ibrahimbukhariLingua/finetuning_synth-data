## History

The 12-story building was completed in 1922, and it was dedicated in 1923. It was built as the Los Angeles headquarters of the Bank of Italy, a forerunner to Bank of America founded by Amadeo Giannini. It was designed by the architectural firm Morgan, Walls & Clements, in the Neoclassical architectural style with "Doric columns, ornate golden ceiling and marble floors." The bronze front doors are surrounded by terra cotta sculptures of American coins.

It belonged to the Chetrit Group, until it was acquired by the Sydell Group for US$39 million. From 2015 to 2017, the building was remodeled into the NoMad Los Angeles Hotel, with additional investments from billionaire Ronald Burkle. The hotel opened in 2018, but closed in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It reopened in 2022 as the Hotel Per La.
