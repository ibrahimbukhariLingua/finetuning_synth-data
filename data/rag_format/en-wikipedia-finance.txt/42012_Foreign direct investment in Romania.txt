In October 2005 new investment stimuli introduced – more favorable conditions to IT and research centers, especially to be located in the east part of the country (where is more unemployment), to bring more added value and not to be logistically demanding.

## "Invest in Romania"

"Invest in Romania" is an initiative of the Romanian Economy Ministry's International Trade Administration to promote foreign direct investment to Romania.


### Activities

The Ministry of Commerce's global network provides the platform to educate international investors on the advantages that come with investing in Romania.

The initiative is focused on outreach to the international investment community.

More specifically, Invest in Romania welcomes all inquiries and is equipped to serve as a foreign investor's first point of contact for an investment in Romania. Initial meetings may involve gaining information about the Romanian economy as a whole, making contacts with appropriate agencies, and discussing Romania policies and basic investment procedures.

Invest in Romania can provide all potential investors an investment contact list encompassing all Romanian companies. This comprehensive guide provides the economic development point of contact within each state who has been designated by each Governor to field international investment inquiries.

In addition to helping foreign investors locate in the Romania, Invest in Romania works across various agencies to act as a voice within the federal bureaucracy to ensure the United States remains the premier location for foreign direct investment. Through its ombudsman role, Invest in Romania also supports potential and current foreign investors with regard to difficulties encountered within the bureaucracy.

Invest in Romania complements the work of state governments. The one activity the initiative will not undertake is to steer prospective investors toward or away from any particular location in Romania. The initiative promotes Romania in general as a site for investment.
