## Trader education

Shannon began educating and mentoring people about technical analysis and trading techniques at MarketWise.

Alphatrends was created by Shannon in 2006 where his active participation in financial education included blog posts as well as daily video updates. The blog was called the "YouTube of technical analysis" by the editor of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities in describing Shannon's teaching and occasional reviews of the *Wallstrip* stock of the day picks.ᶜⁱʳᶜᵘˡᵃʳ ʳᵉᶠᵉʳᵉⁿᶜᵉ As of 2010, over 400 people subscribed to Shannon's trading service.

Shannon&#39;s primary focus is on price action and he registered the domain www.onlypricepays.com after repeatedly referencing that phrase since 2005. Technical trading tools and indicators like the VWAP and moving averages are taught and talked about in Shannon's Alphatrends posts. Shannon does look at volume because it shows him "the collective psychology of the participants if they are fearful or overly optimistic" but advises traders to use price to position their exit rather than volume. His approach is focused on assisting people apply these to make decisions about market direction and risk management. Shannon asserts that "you must have a backup plan for every situation. And you must do this before you enter your every trade".

Shannon provides mentoring services for new traders looking to improve their performance in the markets. He likes to mentor people with "street smarts" that can anticipate their thought flow and actions.

## Books

*Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes* was published by Shannon in 2008. The book was written to assist traders new to technical analysis with intermediate level material such as market structure and trend alignment. Though the book has been referred to as a "textbook", it is not "'dry', boring and difficult". The book is filled with advice and “nifty” sayings to assist the reader's memory. Timothy Sykes called the book the "single most accurate/honest/understandable book on charting since Steve Nison’s classic: Japanese Candlestick Charts." Alex Capel at Wall St Cheat Sheet called the book a "must-have" for new and intermediate traders and Howard Lindzon added it to his top ten trading books in 2008. Edward Dobson, the President of Traders Press Inc. also noted that Shannon's book "earns a place in my 'top 10 trading books ever written' list". Charles E. Kirk of The Kirk Report noted that while many traders struggle to explain their methods, Shannon broke down "relatively complex ideas" in a very "straightforward manner". The Market Technicians Association review of the book called it "readable and valuable" for both novices and experienced traders.ᶜⁱʳᶜᵘˡᵃʳ ʳᵉᶠᵉʳᵉⁿᶜᵉ

The book works through concepts in sections starting with explanations of the accumulation, markup, distribution, and decline phases of the market cycle. Shannon then describes how he applies analysis of price, trends, support and resistance, moving averages, volume, and time frames to define his trading methodology. He discusses these indicators and the psychology surrounding the moves associated with them. After building the framework of analysis, Shannon describes the selection of long versus short strategies. Shannon focuses on price action but takes the time to detail his views on the interpretation of news and fundamental data into the price. In the final section, Shannon offers the reader valuable wisdom on risk management, exiting a trade, and defines his personal rules.

*Maximum Trading Gains With Anchored VWAP* was published by Shannon in 2023. It builds on Shannon's foundational book, *Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes.* It explains how to use the Anchored VWAP (AVWAP) to make better entries and exits, to time breakouts and breakdowns, and to set stop losses. Both new and experienced traders and investors will appreciate the book's insights and systematic approach to using AVWAP in a variety of situations including IPOs, support and resistance, market direction, short sales and squeezes, and financial news.

Every chapter includes solid advice on managing risk, which Shannon emphasizes throughout the book, "is Job One." Shannon is a trader's trader who avoids jargon. The book offers over 145 color charts, tables and case studies to set out a definitive framework for understanding the three most important components in the price, time, and volume.
