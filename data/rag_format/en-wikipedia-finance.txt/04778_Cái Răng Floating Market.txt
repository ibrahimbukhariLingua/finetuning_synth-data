Cái Răng Floating Market


# Cái Răng Floating Market



**Cái Răng Floating Market**, also written as **Cai Rang Floating Market**, is a wholesale floating market specializing in the trade of vegetables and fruits on the Hau River, and is a unique tourist attraction in the Cái Răng district in Cần Thơ, Vietnam.

In 2016, Cái Răng Floating Market was recognized as a national intangible cultural heritage by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of Vietnam.


## Location

The market is located on the Hau River, near Cái Răng Bridge, about 7 kilometers from the center of Can Tho.

Visitors can reach the floating market in two ways: either by renting a boat at Ninh Kieu Wharf or by taking a car to An Binh Market (in Ninh Kieu District) and then renting a boat. The boat fare is 100,000 VND per person.


## Background

The uniqueness and main feature of Cái Răng Floating Market is the sale of vegetables and fruits from the Mekong Delta. In the past, the floating market developed because the waterways played a near-exclusive role in transportation. As trade demand increased, people would gather at river junctions, making them ideal spots for trading. Today, although the road network has expanded significantly, leading to the disappearance of many floating markets, tourism activities have allowed Cái Răng Floating Market to evolve into a more sustainable form.


## Characteristics

Cái Răng Floating Market is also a wholesale market specializing in vegetables and fruits. The market opens at around 2–3 AM, with peak activity from 4–6 AM, though buying and selling continues throughout the day. As a wholesale market, goods are brought here in relatively large quantities. Each type of product is sorted by quality and size. Boats, primarily "ghe bầu" (large, flat-bottomed boats), are the main means of transport and loading.

Visitors can immerse themselves in the bustling market atmosphere and observe the lives of merchant families, with multiple generations living on boats. Each boat is like a floating house, equipped with potted plants, pets, and modern amenities like color TVs, DVD players, and even motorbikes parked on the boats.

At the market, goods are advertised by a method known as "beo hang,'" which refers to hanging a sample of the goods (such as fruits or vegetables) on a long pole instead of using signs. The "selling boat" typically hangs any plant pot to distinguish it from the "buying boat." The "beo" is a long pole (often made of bamboo), tied with any item for marking or signaling something. It has been a long-standing practice in the daily lives of people in the Southwest region of Vietnam.


## Operating Hours

The Cái Răng Floating Market usually starts early, around 2–3 AM. The best time for visitors is between 5–6 AM. The market is closed or operates on a limited basis during the Lunar New Year (1st and 2nd days of Tet) and Doan Ngo Festival (5th day of the 5th lunar month). Due to market-goers' needs, not only are there boats selling vegetables and fruits, but also many other services such as food and shopping. Fruit-selling boats often weave through the crowd to serve tourists.


## Tourism

Cái Răng Floating Market is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Can Tho. It is considered a cultural symbol of the waterway region, attracting many visitors, especially foreign tourists. Almost all tours to Can Tho City include a visit to the floating market.
