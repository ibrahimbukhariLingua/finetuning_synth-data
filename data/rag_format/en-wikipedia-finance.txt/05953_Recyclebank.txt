## History

In 2001, New York City was considering cancelling its recycling program. Then Fordham Law student Patrick FitzGerald drafted a business model to financially incentivize people to recycle and allow businesses to promote sustainability. In 2003, he contacted Ron Gonen, a high school friend, for assistance. By 2003, the two had completed a business plan, and by 2004, began a pilot program in Philadelphia. In 2009, Recyclebank became a certified B corporation.
