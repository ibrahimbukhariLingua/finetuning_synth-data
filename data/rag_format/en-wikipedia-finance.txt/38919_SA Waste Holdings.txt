## Known customers (past, present and prospective)

SA Waste is a registered contractor with Sabai (a townhouse complex in Randburg). It is unclear what services they provide to Sabai, as Pikitup is the only company in Johannesburg that is permitted to collect waste form residential buildings.

According to the April/May 2000 issue of *Vodaworld* Magazine, Vodacom also counted themselves as a client. SA Waste was responsible for collecting waste from Vodacom's site on a daily basis, and transporting it to their recycling plant, where it would be sorted and sold to external recycling companies.

In 2006 to 2007, the company was a registered supplier to Pikitup, where they were awarded tender number PU 68/2003, providing hire of labour to the parastatal. This contract ended on 28 February 2007.

SA Waste is in the process (as of March 2008) of tendering for another contract at Pikitup. This one will involve providing of a total refuse removal service (Including round-collected refuse removal, street cleaning, servicing of garden sites, and servicing informal settlements) for Johannesburg's Ivory Park area.

## In the news

On 12 May 2005, Gauteng environment minister Khabisi Mosunkutu paid a surprise visit to their recycling plant in Marlboro, near Alexandra (North of Johannesburg). The company was accused of illegally using their recycling plant to store non-recyclable and unsortable waste. Following the visit, the minister instructed that the site be shut down immediately and be given 14 days to remove all rubbish from the area. This was not the first such warning the company had been issued with. On 29 May 2005, the debacle was reported by the popular wildlife and environmental programme, 50/50. After much effort from SA Waste to clean up their operations, they were granted a conditional green light to resume operations, on 30 September 2005.

On 7 July 2005, SA Waste participated in Reach For a Dream's attempt at the Guinness World Record for a 2.6 kilometres (1.6 mi) long birthday cake (An event which took place at Cresta Shopping Centre in Johannesburg). This attempt was successful, with the official length of the cake being 2,666 metres (8,747 ft).
