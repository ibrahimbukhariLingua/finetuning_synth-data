Skema Business School


# Skema Business School



**SKEMA Business School** ("School of Knowledge Economy and Management") is one of the leading French business schools devoted to higher education and research. It has the legal status of a non-profit association under the French "1901 law". It was founded in 2009 as a result of the merger between the Ecole Supérieure de Commerce (ESC), Lille and CERAM Business School [fr], Sophia Antipolis, for economic reasons. The Lille school was founded in 1892 and CERAM in 1963.
It offers programmes such as a BBA in Global Management, Master of Science (MS and MSc), EMBA, doctorates in Business Administration.


## History

The merger was announced on 30 June 2009, and they now form a single non-profit organization confirmed by their respective governing bodies (the General Assembly of the French Riviera Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Directors of ESC Lille). In spite of some criticism due to the heterogeneity level regarding student selection, the official ceremony and announcement of the new name took place on 16 November 2009. CERAM Business School and ESC Lille were respectively founded in 1963 by the French Riviera Chamber of Commerce and in 1892 by Lille Chamber of Commerce.
The new school name, SKEMA, is derived from the Greek, skhêma (shape, figure, formation of an object) meaning schema in Latin. It also stands for the initial letters of "School of Knowledge Economy and Management".

The consolidated middle schools is now one of the largest French business schools in the number of students (8,500), seventh in number of teachers (166) and sixth in terms of budget.

Since its beginnings in 2009 as a result of the merger between ESC Lille and CERAM Business School, SKEMA has been a global business school with the same ambition for its French and international campuses: to train mobile and adaptable leaders and managers, able to contribute to the knowledge economy and generate sustainable performance with an appreciation for the values and challenges of society, the environment and the economy.


## Grande école degrees

SKEMA Business School is a *grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. *Grandes écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France.

The degrees are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the *Licence* / Bachelor's degrees, and the Master's and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various "parcours" or paths based on UE (Unités d'enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Bachelors is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (Grand Ecole Program) ends with the degree of Master's in Management (MiM).


## Campuses

SKEMA has opened several international campuses. It has three campuses in France in Lille, Paris and Sophia Antipolis near Nice, and campuses in China (Suzhou), Brazil (Belo Horizonte) and the USA (Raleigh, North Carolina, in partnership with North Carolina State University). Lille and Sophia Antipolis campuses are the historic locations of the ESC Lille and CERAM Business School.

Previously occupied by Airbus, it spreads across 30,000 m² (320,000 sq ft) comprising 40 classrooms and two large lecture halls. This campus will also have a rooftop of 1,600m², a co-working space and a student residence. It has opened in January 2021.

Skema announced the opening of a new campus in Cape Town (South Africa) at the beginning of academic year 2019/2020.

The Lille campus is located in the Euralille business district in the north of France. The Lille campus gathers more than 2,200 students over 16,000 m2. A partnership has been established with the University of Lille to develop joint-programmes and combine the institutions' research efforts in the Lille School of Management Research Center.

The Sophia Antipolis campus is located in the technology park of the same name in the south of France. A partnership with Sciences Po Aix offers joint-programmes, enabling business students to study political sciences.
