# Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily



**Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily** (Russian: Организация Уполномоченного по филателии и бонам в СССР (ОУФБ)) was established in Moscow in 1922 by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) for matters concerned with philately and bonds. An old Bolshevik Feodor Chuchin headed this organisation.


## History

To help finance the Central Famine Relief Committee (POMGOL), VTsIK decided to sell abroad postage stamps of Imperial Russia and the newly formed governments of the Civil War period. The idea was to obtain hard currency for them. Feodor Chuchin was named in 1921 the POMGOL commissioner for matters pertaining to stamp donations.

In March 1922, the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily was set up. Chuchin was appointed to supervise its activities in Soviet Russia and abroad. The sale of stamps and paper money was profitable:

> In the financial report for November 1922 it was indicated that the finance office of the VTsIK received deposits worth 2,970,000 rubles on the organisation's account.
>

The Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily existed till 1926 and was superseded by the Soviet Philatelic Association.
