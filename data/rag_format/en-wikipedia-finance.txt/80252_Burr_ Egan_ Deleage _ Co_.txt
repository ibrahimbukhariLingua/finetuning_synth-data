## Successor firms

The three founders, left BEDCO in 1995 and began raising their first independent venture capital fund. Today, Polaris Venture Partners is a venture capital firm specializing in seed and early stage investments particularly in companies engaged in the information technology and life sciences sectors. Polaris is based in Waltham, Massachusetts with an additional office in Seattle, Washington.

Since 1995, Polaris has raised five venture capital funds with over $2.6 billion of investor commitments.

Polaris Venture Partners V, which was closed in 2006, raised $1 billion of investor commitments.
