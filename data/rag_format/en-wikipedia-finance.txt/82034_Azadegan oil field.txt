# Azadegan oil field



The **Azadegan oil field** is an oil field in Iran. It is located 80 kilometres (50 mi) west of Ahvaz, near the Iraqi border.


## History

The first exploration well was drilled in the field in 1976, but its discovery was finalized after drilling the second well in 1999. The field has an approximate area of 900 square kilometres (350 sq mi).


## Reserves

Iranian authorities claim that the Azadegan field has oil-in-place reserves of about 33.2 billion barrels (5.28×10~~^~~⁹ m³) and recoverable resources estimated at about 5.2 billion barrels (830×10~~^~~⁶ m³). It is one of the NIOC Recent Discoveries and the biggest oil field found in Iran in the last 30 years.

Sarvak, Kazhdomi, Godvan, and Fahilan are productive layers of the field. The current production is 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m³/d). Crude oil produced by the Fahilan layer is light while the other layers yield heavy crude.
