# Scott Galloway (professor)



**Scott Galloway** (born November 3, 1964) is an American public speaker, author, podcast host, and entrepreneur. He is a clinical professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business.


## Early life and education

Galloway grew up in Los Angeles, California. His father was a Scottish immigrant to the United States who worked as a sales executive. His mother, a Jewish immigrant from London, England, worked as a secretary.


## Career

Following his graduation from UCLA in 1987, Galloway worked as a fixed income analyst at Morgan Stanley.

In 1992, he founded Prophet, a brand and marketing consultancy firm. In 1997, he founded RedEnvelope, an e-commerce site specializing in unique and personalized gifts. In 2010, Galloway founded the digital intelligence firm L2 Inc, which was acquired in March 2017 by Gartner for $155 million, and the now defunct Firebrand Partners, founded in 2005, an activist hedge fund that invested over $1 billion in U.S. consumer and media companies. In 2019, Galloway founded the online education startup Section4. He raised $30 million in the Series A round in 2021 for a total funding of $37 million.

He was elected to the 1999 class of the World Economic Forum's "Global Leaders of Tomorrow", which recognizes 100 individuals under the age of 40 whose accomplishments have had impact on a global level.

He has served on the board of directors of Eddie Bauer, The New York Times Company, Gateway Computer, Urban Outfitters, and Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Galloway is also known for his public presentations and TED-style talks, called *Winners & Losers*, in which he presented L2's Digital IQ Index results, ranking over 2,500 global brands across numerous dimensions including e-commerce, social media, and digital marketing.

Galloway teaches brand management and digital marketing to second-year MBA students. Much of his research focuses on the Big Four tech companies, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, which he refers to as "The Four" or "the Four Horsemen". His first book, *The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,* was published in 2017. It analyzes the Big Four's peculiar strengths and strategies, their novel economic models, their inherent rapacity, their ambition, and the drastic consequences of their rise that people face in both social and individual terms.

In May 2017, Galloway anticipated Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods Market, a transaction that became reality the following month. He denied any insider knowledge and said he was "just lucky" on that call. In early 2018, Galloway predicted the planned Amazon HQ2 would be located in either the New York metropolitan area or the Washington metropolitan area; with the decision to create two locations, Galloway ended up predicting both correctly.

In September 2018, Recode and the Vox Media Podcast Network launched Pivot, a weekly news commentary podcast co-hosted by Kara Swisher and Galloway. In February 2020, Galloway launched *The Prof G Show*, a weekly podcast answering listener questions on business, money, and tech.

In August 2019, Galloway published a highly critical analysis of WeWork's initial public offering filing, criticizing the company's unprofitability as well as its culture, corporate structure, nepotism, and the evidence of self-dealing on the part of founder Adam Neumann, while also castigating JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, the investment banks underwriting the launch, saying that they "stand to register $122 million in fees flinging feces at retail investors. Any equity analyst who endorses this stock above a $10 billion valuation is lying, stupid, or both."

On September 28, 2021, CNN announced that Galloway would be a host on its CNN+ streaming platform, though the platform went off the air shortly after launching.

In 2022, Galloway's weekly newsletter *No Mercy/No Malice* won the Webby Award and Webby's People's Voice Award for best Business, News & Technology Websites and Mobile Sites.


## Positions

Since 2017, Galloway has repeatedly called for U.S. government antitrust intervention against the four consumer technology companies Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, ultimately breaking them up. He advocated against Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency plans in July 2019 due to the company's "gross negligence of user privacy".

In 2019, Galloway endorsed Michael Bloomberg's presidential 2020 candidacy as he "fulfills the Democrats' need for a strong centrist candidate".

In December 2019, he called for the removal of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey while declaring to own more than 330,000 shares of Twitter stock. Relating to the 2015–16 Apple–FBI dispute, he sided with the U.S. government and said that "security agencies should have access to [personal] data wherever it is if a judge deems that data is key to people's safety or national security."


## Personal life

Galloway is married to his second wife, Beata Galloway, a real estate developer born in Poland, whom he met at the Raleigh Hotel pool in Miami. They have two sons together.

Since 2022, Galloway and his family have resided in London.

Galloway identifies as an atheist.


### Philanthropy

As of March 2019, Galloway donates 100% of his NYU compensation back to the university. He donated $4.4 million to Berkeley for immigrant student fellowships as well as smaller sums to UCLA and NYU. In July 2024, he donated $12 million to UCLA and UC Berkeley to establish the UC Excelerator program.


## In popular culture

Galloway is played by Kelly AuCoin in the 2022 series *WeCrashed*. When asked why Galloway was included in the show, co-creators Lee Eisenberg and Drew Crevello credited Galloway's critical blog post about WeWork was a "the Emperor has no clothes moment" for them, meaning that Galloway opened their eyes to the impending doom of WeWork, eventually inspiring the show.
