## Career

Hamilton ran his own consulting business in Durham, North Carolina from 1990 to 1996. He offered consulting to people trying to start businesses. He also gave lectures and taught college courses.

## Charitable work

Hamilton was a lecturer at prisons, being under contract with the SBA to help with a minority set-aside program. One of his clients, Rev. Robert Harris, asked him to be part of a prison ministry where Hamilton would discuss entrepreneurship. This led to Hamilton founding "Inmates to Entrepreneurs", a program that offers training and mentoring for aspiring entrepreneurs who have criminal records.

In addition, he founded the Brian Hamilton Foundation, an organization that provides advice for young people and others who want to become entrepreneurs. He has provided commentary as an expert for The Wall Street Journal, MSNBC and Fox Business Network, and also sat on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University.

In 2021, Hamilton became the star of the television series "Free Enterprise," which airs on ABC stations as part of the Hearst Media Production Group weekend programming block. The show features the stories of formerly incarcerated people with dreams of starting their own businesses.
