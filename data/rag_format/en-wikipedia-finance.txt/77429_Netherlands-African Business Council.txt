## Events

NABC organizes different events to keep companies in contact with other entrepreneurs and Africa's opportunities. Events are usually held in the Netherlands and mostly attended by the NABC members, businessmen looking for some matchmaking possibilities, ambassadors and speakers. The NABC organizes seminars that are informative afternoons where speakers from well-known companies or economic attachés from an African country talk about the business opportunities in that country and cover specific topics.

The Netherlands-African Business Council rarely organizes a conference but an example is the first Business Summit Netherlands-African 2010 on 3 November on ‘How to improve your Africa strategy’. Two hundred participants attended this conference which is the first of its kind covering African business opportunities. Many of NABC's African members flew over just to attend this event. The summit was a full day program in Castle The Wittenberg in Wassenaar (close to The Hague) with 5 workshops and 15 speakers of big Dutch firms that have been active in Africa for a long time. Speakers were present from companies such as Heineken, Rabobank, FMO, TNO, DSM, Philips and Vlisco.


## Trade missions

The Netherlands-African Business Council has the knowledge and experience essential for networking services for the Dutch and African private sector that trade with each other. NABC organizes a couple trade missions per year to and from Africa covering different sectors and countries. There are the incoming trade missions where delegates from a country come to the Netherlands for usually a couple of days to a week. The outgoing trade missions are usually subsidized by the CPA program in corporation with the NL EVD International, in 2023 part of the Dutch government Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland. NABC organizes their program, accommodation and transport. During their stay the participants visit some companies, meet some business people during matchmaking sessions and visit some governmental institutions.

Then there are the outgoing missions which are trade missions to an African country covering a couple of sectors. The aim of such missions is to familiarize Dutch companies with the local business climate, introduce them to local partners and distributors, and to give them an insight into the local private sector development programs. Usually these are attended by 6 to 12 NABC members and sometimes non-members. Members pay their own ticket to the country and accommodation, NABC arranges local transport. To attend the program is free of charge. The NABC organizes a program for a couple of days to a week with again some company visits and meetings at some government institutes. Of course there are the infamous matchmaking sessions and some time for leisure which is part of the African business life.
