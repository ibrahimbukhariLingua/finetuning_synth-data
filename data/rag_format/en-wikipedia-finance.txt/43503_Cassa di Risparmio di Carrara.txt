## History

**Cassa di Risparmio di Carrara** was found in 1843 in Carrara in the Duchy of Modena and Reggio. In 1992 the statutory corporation was split into a limited company (Italian: *società per azioni*) and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Carrara (a banking foundation). At that time the banking foundation owned 66.67% stake of the company, with the rest was owned by Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo). In 1995, a sub-holding company "Carinord Holding" was formed, which Cariplo was the significant shareholder for 30.93% stake, in turn the holding owned 90% stake of CR Carrara. The holding also owned the saving bank in Alessandria (50% + 1 share) and Spezia (68.19%). In 1998 Cariplo became part of Banca Intesa. In 2002 Carinord was split into Carinord 1 and Carinord 2; CR Alessandria was owned by Carinord 1 S.p.A. and Carispezia and CAR Carrara were owned by Carinord 2. As at 31 December 2002, Banca Intesa owned 41.14% stake in Carinord 2 S.p.A. , with the banking foundations of Carispezia and CR Carrara remained as the minority shareholders of the sub-holding.

In 2003 CR Carrara and Carispezia were acquired by Banca Carige and Banca CR Firenze respectively. Carige acquired about 43.49% stake in Carinord 2 from Intesa (16.46% for €46 million) and the banking foundation of CR Carrara (27.03%) for €183,764,644 in total (with 5,192,231 shares or 2.44% stake of Carinord 2 was re-sold to Banca CR Firenze for €10,301,778 in the eve of demerger). In April 2004 Carinord 2 was demerged and Caricarrara Holding S.p.A. was created, making the 90% stake of the saving bank cost Carige about €173 million.

As at 31 December 2014, the banking foundation still owned 10% of the saving bank, as well as 0.679% stake in Banca Carige.

In 2015 Banca Carige absorbed CR Carrara and sister companies Cassa di Risparmio di Savona and Columbus Carige Immobiliare. Carige purchased the remaining 10% stake by issuing new shares of Carige.
