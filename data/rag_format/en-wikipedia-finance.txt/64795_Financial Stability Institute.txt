Financial Stability Institute


# Financial Stability Institute



The **Financial Stability Institute** (FSI) is one of the bodies hosted by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland.


## Purpose

Established in 1999 by the BIS and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, its primary role is to improve the co-ordination between national banks regulators through holding seminars and acting as a clearing house for information on regulatory practice.


## History

The FSI was set up in response to the East Asian financial crisis of 1997, as the result of a perceived weakness in co-ordination between national regulators in matters of training and general understanding of financial systems. As a result, its work is concentrated in the regulators of the non-G-10 nations.
