Ideal Standard


# Ideal Standard



**Ideal Standard** is a privately held multinational plumbing fixture company headquartered in Belgium.

Operating primarily in Latin America and Europe, the brand dates back to 1949, when it was used to brand fixtures of the foreign operations of the American Standard group. The "Ideal" name traces back to the "Ideal Boilers" brand used by the American Radiator Company.


## Overview

A new company, known as Ideal Standard International, was formed in 2007 by the sale of the bath and kitchen products businesses of American Standard Companies for $1.745 billion to Bain Capital Partners. The North American and Asian operations of American Standard were sold to Sun Capital and Lixil Group respectively, with the European and Latin American operations retained as Ideal Standard.

The company was then restructured, implementing cost-cutting measures, as well as moving some of company's production facilities to Asia and Eastern Europe – a new production site was opened in Bulgaria. The acquisition by Bain Capital was facilitated by Credit Suisse and Bank of America; the creditors subsequently struggled to dispose of their debt.

The restructuring program was complete in 2011, but the company was loss making in 2012 due to poor sales. In 2013 the company reduced its workforce by 250 due to poor sales; further restructuring was proposed in 2014, including a debt for equity swap with bondholder Anchorage Capital. In 2014 the EU competition commission approved Anchorage Capital becoming joint owner of the company together with Bain Capital.
