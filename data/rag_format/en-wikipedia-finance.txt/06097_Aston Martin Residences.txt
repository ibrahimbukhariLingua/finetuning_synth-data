Aston Martin Residences


# Aston Martin Residences



**Aston Martin Residences** is a 66-story skyscraper in Miami, Florida, United States, located in Downtown Miami along the Miami River and Biscayne Bay. It is the tallest all-residential building south of New York City, though it is slightly shorter than the Panorama Tower in nearby Brickell. The building features a helipad on the roof and a full-service marina that can accommodate superyachts.
The building contains 391 residences, with 99% of those residences have been sold as of 6 May, 2024. The only one remaining is the triplex penthouse unit which includes the last ever Aston Martin Vulcan with purchase. The building topped out in December 2021. Aston Martin Residences is being developed by G&G Business Developments in conjunction with Aston Martin. Miami-based Cervera Real Estate is handling sales of the 66-story tower.


## History

The 1.25-acre (0.5-hectare) site was purchased at a record price of US$100 million per acre, selling for US$125 million in 2014. In 2019 concrete for construction was poured over 36 hours, and was expected to be the largest single pour to date in the Miami region. By late 2020, over 30 floors had been built. On December 1, 2021, the building officially topped out as the tallest residential building south of New York City with a fireworks display on the Miami River, commemorating this milestone for the building as the second tallest building in Miami and Florida. Completion of the project also included a section of the Miami Riverwalk that was blocked.
