## History

Charlie Marshall founded The Sleep Room in 2008, after previously owning and selling another business. Marshall generated the startup capital for The Sleep Room from the sale of his previous company, Primal Soup and personal finance he had accrued from real estate development. The amount invested initially was £350,000. During the early days, Marshall focused on bed sales, providing 12 different styles of bed, with a single mattress type. It was stated that Marshall visited over 187 mattress and bed factories before deciding on the mattress he would sell through The Sleep Room.

In 2012, it was announced that the company would be rebranded, and would now operate under the name Loaf. The rebrand followed the expansion of the company's product range away from beds and sleep related products. The Telegraph covered the launch of their sofas and armchairs, while also announcing the company would be selling lighting, rugs and textiles. During the next year, it was announced that the company would expand to selling kitchen furniture.

Loaf was listed on the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 in 2013. They were in 40th position overall, and the 3rd fastest growing retailer in the United Kingdom. The company's growth continued in 2014 and they again featured in the 2014 Sunday Times list.
