Invest supervised and supported both financial institutions and independent registered representatives who offered advisory services, investment and insurance products. Invest was formed in 1982 under Dan McConnell and was the first firm to offer securities inside a bank lobby.

By 2018, Invest had over $24 billion in assets managed by over 1,200 Advisers who are registered with Invest.

## History

Formed and solely-owned by Dan McConnell in 1982, Invest Financial was later bought by Brentwood Securities. Brentwood changed its name to Investment Services for America (ISFA) – ISFA Holding Company. Kemper Financial, a major shareholder of ISFA sold Invest to First American National Bank in 1996. First American National Bank was then bought by AmSouth Bank in mid-1999.

In 2000, Invest was sold by AmSouth Bank to National Planning Holdings (NPH) and is still a subsidiary of the corporation. Under the NPH umbrella, in 2004, Invest implemented EOE software and E-Sign technology. EOE is a network of online forms, electronic blotters, and basic compliance checks that representatives use when working with clients. E-Sign, a part of EOE, allows representatives to get client signatures for documentation on an electronic pad, eliminating paperwork.
