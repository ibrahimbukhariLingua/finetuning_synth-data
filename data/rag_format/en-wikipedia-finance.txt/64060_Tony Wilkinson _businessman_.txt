**Anthony Harwick Wilkinson** (born April 1937) is a British businessman, who was the co-owner and former chairman of the British high street chain Wilko.


## Early life

Anthony Harwick Wilkinson was born in April 1937, the son of Wilko founder James Kemsey Wilkinson and his wife Mary Cooper.


## Career

When Tony Wilkinson retired as chairman of Wilko after 45 years in June 2005, he was replaced by his niece, Karin Swann, and his daughter, Lisa Wilkinson. In 2014, Karin Swann sold her family's 50% holding in the business to Lisa Wilkinson.

In May 2019, the *Sunday Times Rich List* estimated his net worth at £252 million.

Following his retirement and Karin Swann's share sale, daughter Lisa Wilkinson oversaw the Wilko chain's eventual collapse, as it entered administration on 10 August 2023. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed administrator to the business the same day.

During the administration of the business, it transpired its ownership had taken £77m out of the business in the preceding decade.
