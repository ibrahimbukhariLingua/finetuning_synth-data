Juffali was responsible for developing the first power generation (electricity), and telecommunication in Saudi Arabia as-well as television concessions. Later on the Al Juffali group introduced many other fields to Saudi Arabia such as power utilities, construction, insurance, telecommunications, and vehicle manufacturing and distribution.
