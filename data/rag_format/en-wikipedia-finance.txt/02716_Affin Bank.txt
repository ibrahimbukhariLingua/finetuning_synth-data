## Corporate identity

Affin Bank introduces its iconographic logo upon its establishment in 1975. The bank incorporated a *Hibiscus × rosa-sinensis*, also known as the *bunga raya*, a national flower of Malaysia as its corporate logo, which underwent rebranding 4 times with the exception of its fifth logo, which only consists of the bank's wordmark which formerly stylized in italic as ***AFFIN**BANK* (first used in 2000) rather than a hibiscus logo. The bank's sixth and current logo, a modernized version of the hibiscus, was introduced on 1 November 2020 and marks the return of its iconic hibiscus logo which was absent for 15 years.

The five petals is stands for Affin, which "acronymised to describe the core values of the bank as an organisation that is always innovating, adapting, placing customer first and emphasising integrity as its foundation", while its logo evolution represents its transformation "to emerge as a progressive bank of the future by embracing technology and adapting amid an ever-changing business environment". The bank also uses slogans for its identity. From 2005 to 2020, "Banking Without Barriers" (*Perbankan Tanpa Sempadan*) was its former slogan. Following its corporate rebranding in November 2020, Affin Bank introduces its new slogan, "Always About You" (*Sentiasa Untuk Anda*).
