1910 Australian referendum (Surplus Revenue)


# 1910 Australian referendum (Surplus Revenue)



The *Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill* 1909, was an unsuccessful Australian referendum which sought to alter the Australian Constitution to amend section 87 (the 'Braddon Clause') which was due to lapse in 1910. It was to add to the Constitution a financial agreement reached between the States and the Commonwealth to replace the section.

The referendum was held in the **1910 Australian referendum** in conjunction with the State Debts referendum, which received a Yes vote in 5 states and was carried. The referendums were held on the same day as the 1910 federal election, which Alfred Deakin's Commonwealth Liberal Party lost to Andrew Fisher's Labour Party, with Fisher being sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 April.
