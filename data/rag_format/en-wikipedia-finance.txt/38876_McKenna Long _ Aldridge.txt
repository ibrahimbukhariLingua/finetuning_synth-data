## History

McKenna Long & Aldridge was formed by the 2002 merger of two firms—the Washington, DC–based McKenna & Cuneo and the Atlanta-based Long Aldridge & Norman. The firm that would become McKenna & Cuneo was founded in 1939 by Franklin D. Roosevelt's former attorney general, Homer Stille Cummings. In a December 1999 profile of McKenna & Cuneo, the *Legal Times* noted that early lawyers at the firm, Gilbert Cuneo and Albert Reeves Jr., helped create the nation's first government contracts practice.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ The firm that would become Long Aldridge & Norman was founded in 1974 by Clay Long, John Aldridge and Bill Stevens. The firm focused on corporate and business law through its Atlanta and Washington, DC offices.

In 2012, MLA and San Diego–based law firm Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps LLP combined practices. Luce Forward, founded in 1873 by Moses A. Luce, was the first law firm founded in what would become San Diego, California, and was the firm responsible for drafting the charter that established the city. The merged firms operate under the name McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP.

In April 2015, it was agreed that the firm would merge with the law firm Dentons. The merger was completed in June 2015.


## Noteworthy cases

* The firm represented the government of Canada in connection with the record-breaking reorganizations of Chrysler and General Motors (GM). The firm served as lead counsel in both transactions for the government of Canada. The firm advised the government of Canada on the court-supervised sale of Chrysler that resulted in an alliance with Italian car maker Fiat. As part of the transaction, the Canadian government along with the province of Ontario provided a $3.775 billion loan, which enabled Canada to maintain its 20 percent production share in the North American market and protect nearly one million Canadian jobs. In connection with the court-supervised sale of a majority interest in GM to the equity owned largely by the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Canadian government along with the province of Ontario provided a $9.5 billion loan to the new GM—an amount proportional to the $50 billion package provided by the U.S. government.
* The firm's assisted the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation in what is believed to be the first contested union election conducted under a tribal labor statute. The tribe owns and operates Foxwoods Resort Casino and hired the firm when the United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) sought to unionize Foxwoods' bartenders and beverage servicers. The firm began representing the tribe and Foxwoods in late 2007 after the National Labor Relations Board asserted jurisdiction over the tribe, which allowed the United Auto Workers to use federal law to successfully unionize Foxwoods' table games dealers. To avoid the same fate and, more importantly, to preserve tribal sovereignty, the team persuaded the UFCW to hold an election using the Mashantucket Pequot Labor Relations Law instead of the National Labor Relations Act.
* In January 2009, MLA closed a $142 million project finance deal for Balfour Beatty Communities to design, build, develop, renovate and manage privatized family housing at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.
