## Life

After having graduated in the late 1960s with a liberal arts degree, Murphy searched for a position in a Wall Street firm. His first job was with CIT Financial Corporation, where he worked as an assistant to the portfolio manager and charted stocks. In the early 1970s, he worked for Merrill Lynch in their commodity department where he, later on, was promoted to the post of director of technical analysis. In the 1980s, Murphy started off on his own working as a consultant and teaching evening courses at the New York Institute of Finance. During his time as a teacher, he also wrote his very first book named Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets.
