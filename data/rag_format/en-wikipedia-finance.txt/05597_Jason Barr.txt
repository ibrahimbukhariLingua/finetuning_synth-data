# Jason Barr



**Jason M. Barr** is an American economist and author at Rutgers University-Newark, whose work is in the field of "skynomics", the study of skyscrapers and skylines using modern economics methods. He is the author of *Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan's Skyscrapers*, which chronicles the history of the Manhattan skyline from an economic perspective, and *Cities in the Sky: The Quest to Build the World's Tallest Skyscrapers*, which discusses how and why the world's largest cities are building their skylines. Barr's work is interdisciplinary and integrates multiple disciplines including urban studies, geography, and economic history. Barr is one of the few academic economists studying the intersection of economics and skyscraper construction.

## Research On Skyscrapers

Barr examines the economic forces behind their construction including the interplay between engineering, economic, developer, and symbolic heights. His work investigates why skyscrapers are built to certain heights and the economic rationale behind these decisions. For example, research performed by Barr and his colleagues showed that there was no evidence for the Skyscraper Curse, that the completion of the world's tallest building is a herald of an economic crisis. Barr has also debunked the misconception that Manhattan's geological conditions have been the reason there are few skyscrapers between lower Manhattan and Midtown. Rather, Barr's work demonstrates that Midtown's origin was due to the city's demographic evolution and the fact that Manhattan is a long, but narrow, island that concentrated economic activity to a much greater degree, as compared to other cities.

Barr has also written extensively on zoning in the United States including the role of Robert Moses and the City Planning Commission creating the current NYC zones. His "Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan's Skyscrapers" provides a detailed analysis of Manhattan’s development, including how Manhattan's shape and land use patterns, advancements in transport, and neighborhood density affected the location and heights of its tall buildings

Barr’s latest book, "Cities in the Sky:The Quest to Build the World's Tallest Skyscrapers" highlights the global race to build the tallest skyscrapers, examining the economic, cultural, political, and technological motivations. The book begins with the origins of skyscrapers in early 20th-century America, focusing on cities like Chicago and New York. Barr debunks the myth the Home Insurance Building in Chicago was the first skyscraper. He shows that its designation as such was created through a public relations campaign in 1896 by the building's architect, William Le Baron Jenney and his Chicago colleagues, including Daniel H. Burnham. Regarding London's skyscraper history, Barr notes that London initially resisted tall buildings due to both preservationist opposition and lack of need. It wasn't until the 21st century that London saw the rise of modern skyscrapers like the Shard and the Gherkin. Barr contrasts this with the rapid skyscraper development in Hong Kong, which, despite starting later, now has more skyscrapers than Manhattan. Hong Kong's unique land lease system, stemming from its colonial past, has influenced its dense vertical growth, with many skyscrapers serving residential purposes.

The system was later adopted by mainland China, helping to spur an unprecedented skyscraper boom. According to Barr, in the Middle East, Dubai's Burj Khalifa exemplifies skyscraper development driven by consolidated decision-making. Barr argues that skyscrapers create a positive feedback loop for cities, enhancing global connectivity and economic growth. Barr also dunks the myth that the word's tallest buildings are not economically rational. Recording breaking structures are used as part of an economic development strategy that increases tourism, foreign direct investment, and raises property values. However, he also critiques the sustainability of super-tall buildings, advocating for a balance between density and environmental impact. Barr concludes that while skyscrapers can elevate a city's status, their construction must be contextually and economically justified.


## New Mannahatta Project

Barr is an advocate of land reclamation projects such as those seen in Hong Kong and the Netherlands. He is also an advocate of Lower Manhattan expansion. On January 14, 2022 Barr wrote an opinion article in the *New York Times* which proposed the expansion of Manhattan Island.

Barr proposes expanding Manhattan Island by 1,760 acres into New York Harbor to tackle housing affordability and climate change.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This new area, named New Mannahatta, would provide housing for nearly 250,000 people and offer significant protection against sea level rise, flooding, and storm surges.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Barr’s plan would push vulnerable areas like Wall and Broad Streets inland and incorporate wetlands to absorb storm surges, with land built at higher elevations for added protection.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

The new constructions could include diverse housing types and nearly 180,000 new units. Barr highlights the economic feasibility, noting that the high value of New York real estate could fund the project through sales or long-term leases. With 2019 building sales at $1,500 per square foot versus $500 construction costs,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ the profit could cover land and infrastructure costs. The project would boost ferry routes and real estate tax income, with potential support from federal infrastructure funds.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

This "New Mannahatta" project proposal was met with criticism from readers despite the project being quite similar to other already completed projects around the world. Among other academics and city planners Barr's project was met with greater interest.


## Legends Tower Project And criticism

The developer, Matteson Capital is proposing "Legends Tower," which would stand at a staggering height of 1,907 feet, making it the tallest building in the United States if completed. The proposal faces skepticism due to concerns about financing, market demand, and the tower's ability to withstand the region's severe weather conditions, including tornadoes. Despite these challenges, the project has garnered attention for its potential to put Oklahoma City on the map and stimulate economic growth in the region.

The proposal to build the "Legends Tower" in Oklahoma City has stirred considerable debate, with economist Jason Barr expressing skepticism. He questions the economic viability of such a project in a city like Oklahoma City, stating, "It would pencil out in New York, it would pencil out in Chicago, but statistically I can’t see it penciling out in Oklahoma City." Barr raises concerns about the project's financing and whether the market demand in Oklahoma City can support the costs associated with constructing such a towering structure. He also doubts the rationale for including an observation deck. Barr's reservations highlight the challenges facing the developers as they seek to bring their ambitious vision to fruition amidst uncertainties about its economic feasibility and practicality in the context of Oklahoma City's urban landscape.

* *Economic Drivers: Skyscrapers in China*. Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, 2017. ISBN 978-0939493555.

'Economic Drivers' explores China's economic reforms over the past four decades have spurred immense urban growth, marked by a proliferation of skyscrapers across its cities. While these structures symbolize China's economic prowess, little research has focused on their construction. This report aims to fill this gap by analyzing the economic factors driving skyscraper development in China. Using data from 1980 to 2014 across 74 cities, the study examines how economic incentives, social and political benefits, and city identity contribute to skyscraper construction. Regression models reveal a complex interplay between economic fundamentals and competitive motivations. The findings underscore the economic rationale behind China's skyscraper boom and lay the groundwork for further exploration into their role in urbanization.
