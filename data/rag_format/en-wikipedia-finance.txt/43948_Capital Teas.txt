Capital Teas


# Capital Teas



**Capital Teas** is an American specialty tea brand, founded in 2007 in Annapolis, Maryland, that offers premium loose tea and tea-related products. From 2007 through 2018, the company operated brick and mortar stores, peaking at 24 retails stores in eight states by late 2016. Two years later, the company shifted strategies and became an e-commerce-only provider. In October 2018, Anchor Beverages, Inc. took over the Capital Teas brand and operated exclusively in online and wholesale channels. In October 2024, the company changed ownership and relocated to Fredericksburg, Virginia.


## History

From 2007 to 2014, Capital Teas was privately owned by co-founders Peter Martino and Manelle Martino who operated six street-front retail tea stores in Maryland, D.C., and Northern Virginia. In March 2014, Capital Teas received its first $5 million investment from Pear Tree Partners, based in Massachusetts, and began rapidly expanding the brand to 24 stores, with most expansion stores in large shopping malls in eight states. Subsequent investments through Pear Tree Partners made their investment funds the majority shareholders. After several years of success where Capital Teas, Inc. was named to the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest growing companies in America in 2016 and 2017, the rapidly changing retail environment resulted in the company closing many of its expansion stores due to declining foot traffic in shopping malls. In August 2018, the company closed its remaining stores. In October 2018, Anchor Beverages, Inc., a new company started by Peter Martino, one of the original co-founders, took over operations of the Capital Teas brand as an e-Commerce company. In late 2022, Anchor Beverages opened a holiday Capital Teas store at the Annapolis Mall to test viability of returning to limited brick and mortar operations. In October 2024, the company was sold in a private sale, and its headquarters relocated to Fredericksburg, Virginia.

Capital Teas has been recognized as an innovator in the tea industry with products such as their tea and alcohol infusions including Tea Lager Beer Enhancers and Vino Teano Wine Mixers.
