The Seawoods Grand Central is a blend of an implanted travel zone (train station), business spaces and a retail shopping centre all under one rooftop. The retail shopping centre (presently known as Nexus Shopping centre) was offered to Blackstone Group for Rs. 1450 crores (US$226 million) in March 2017.

"With this launch, L&T Realty would be developing close to 15 million sq. ft of residential space within Mumbai alone. The proposed development of over 3 million sq. ft comprising over 2,000 apartments will be developed in phases spanning seven to eight years and has an estimated project revenue of close to Rs 5,000 crore" said Mr Joshi.

He additionally emphasized with other developers, saying, "...With RERA coming in, landowners and developers are rethinking their real estate strategies, people who have land parcels are looking for credible partners on the other side..."

The real estate industry is in a revival in residential deals as information from Q3 FY18 showed positive signs towards home purchasers demonstrating interest. "There has been a revival in residential sales in the Q3 FY17-18. L&T Realty has seen an uprise in sales across our three projects in Mumbai and Bengaluru. Our projects, Emerald Isle, Phase-II in Powai, have drawn an unprecedented interest, generating around 2,000 walk-ins in 120 days. Also, the sales velocity at our maiden project in Bengaluru is at an all-time high. Our total gross sales for Q3 FY17-18 stand 20 per cent higher than the sales of Q3 FY16-17," said Joshi to *Business Standard*. L&T Realty's latest undertaking is Rejuve 360, another forthcoming residential venture in Mulund West, Mumbai, Maharashtra.

These new improvements will increase openings for work in locales around Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander, Thane, and Bhiwandi. Joshi said, "Unlike the prior generation, the millennials aren't keen on spending a few hours of their workday travelling, urging realty developers to plan markets closer to where the labour force is, Seawoods Grand Central one of the few transit-oriented developments in India."

On July 4, 2018, Joshi addressed the IIM Ahmedabad 2018-19 PGPX batch on the topic, "Real Estate Industry: New paradigms and trends"

On December 14, 2019, *Business Standard* published an article featuring Joshi, who mentioned that L&T Realty sold 490 apartments out of the 510 it launched in the Seawoods area of Navi Mumbai – a huge success in an otherwise sluggish market. "The company is seeing good customer interest in the already launched project at Mulund in Mumbai", said Joshi. Besides, the sizes of the apartments are also becoming smaller and prices are becoming more appropriate. "Earlier a two-bedroom apartment would cost Rs 2.25 crore but today, we are launching it at Rs 1.5 crore (in Mulund)," he said. Furthermore, he included, "Today, we ensure a clubhouse is ready with the first customer's handover." L&T Realty is stepping mindfully despite a couple of good residential launches and with the RERA in effect, developers must stay aware of client commitments. Not only does the organization guarantee promise timely ownership of homes, but it also guarantees that comforts like clubhouses are prepared with quick possession. In the current testing market, developments like L&T Realty have an edge because of a solid brand name, budgetary muscle and development capacities.ᵉᵈⁱᵗᵒʳⁱᵃˡⁱᶻⁱⁿᵍ

The December 19th, 2019, edition of the *Economic Times*, featured an article by Joshi. The article states that the real estate sector is being propelled by advancements in three major constituents: government, judiciary, and customers. Recently introduced reforms like the goods and services tax (GST), Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), and the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act have streamlined transactions. Many legacy processes have been overhauled, and several approvals now need no manual intervention, thanks to an overall push towards digitization.
