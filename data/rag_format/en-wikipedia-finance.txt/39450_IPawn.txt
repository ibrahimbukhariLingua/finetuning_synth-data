## Services

Non-recourse loans against valuables, also referred to as pawn loans or asset-based loans, and buying and selling previously owned valuables, are the two primary services offered by iPawn.

Consumers and small enterprises can receive lending and retail services. iPawn offers its services in exchange for high-end products like jewelry, diamonds, gemstones, precious metals and expensive watches.


## History

iPawn was established with the purpose of utilizing the latest technologies and internet for the veteran pawnbroking industry and to serve as a high-end pawn broker, delivering a simple, private way to get loans or sell high end goods through the internet. The idea came after learning about the high interest rates charged by pawn shops. The company launched its services to the public in July 2012. In March 2013 iPawn closed $4 million in its second round of financing from a group of angel investors led by Dr. Rafi Gridron. On May 12, 2014 iPawn announced the launch of a new brand called Worthy dealing only in after-market sales.


## Brick & Mortar Pawn Shop Vs. Online Pawn Shop

While services provided by a brick and mortar pawn shop are similar to those provided by the online ones, there are few main differences: most notably, the means by which services are rendered. In a brick and mortar pawn shop, the process of receiving a loan or selling a valuable is done in person while in an online pawn shop the process is conducted through the internet and a courier of choice. The low inventory overhead results in the ability to provide higher value and lower interest rates. Another notable difference is the appraisal process of the submitted valuables: in a brick and mortar pawn shop, the appraisal is done in the local shop itself while in an online pawn shop, all items are shipped to a central facility where the appraisal is made.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
