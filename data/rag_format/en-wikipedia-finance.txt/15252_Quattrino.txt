Quattrino


# Quattrino



The **quattrino** is an ancient Italian currency denomination largely used in Central Italy, especially in Tuscany and Rome.


## History

Its name derives from the Latin *quater denari*, because its value was equal to four denari. Consequently, its value was one third of a soldo. It disappeared after the unification of Italy in 1861, when the Italian lira was introduced as an equivalent of the french franc.
