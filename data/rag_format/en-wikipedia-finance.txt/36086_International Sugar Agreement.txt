International Sugar Agreement


# International Sugar Agreement



The **International Sugar Agreement**s and similarly named agreements were a series of International treaties that attempted to establish an "orderly relationship between the supply and demand for sugar in the world market." They eventually established the International Sugar Organization.


## Agreements

There have been a number of sugar agreements:

* 1937 **International Agreement regarding the Regulation of Production and Marketing of Sugar**, and Protocol (London, 6 May 1937) that established in Article 2 to "always to assure consumers of an adequate supply of sugar on the world market at a reasonable price not to exceed the cost of production, including a reasonable profit, of efficient producers". It established an **International Sugar Council** and set quotas for the International free market of sugar.
* 1942 - *Protocol to enforce and to prolong the International Agreement regarding the Regulation of Production and Marketing of Sugar of 6 May 1937* (London, 22 July 1942) a wartime treaty that extended the original agreement to 31 August 1944.
