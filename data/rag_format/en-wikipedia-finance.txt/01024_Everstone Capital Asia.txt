# Everstone Capital Asia



**Everstone Capital Asia** (also known as **Everstone**), established in 2006, is a private equity firm founded by Sameer Sain and Atul Kapur. Headquartered in Singapore, it operates globally, maintaining offices not only in India and Singapore but also in London, New York City, Mauritius, and United Arab Emirates.


## History

The origin of the company can be traced back to Future Capital, a financial services firm that was established by Sameer Sain and Atul Kapur in partnership with Future Group in 2005. Sain and Kapur took over Future Capital's private equity business in 2006 to form Everstone Capital.

At first, the company began its operations in London. Soon after, they rapidly expanded, establishing five additional offices in Singapore, India (Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore) and Mauritius. In 2008, it relocated their headquarters to Asia.

In 2018, Everstone opened its office in New York.


## Business overview

In addition to operating in the private equity sector, the company has three other investment verticals;

* Real Estate & Infrastructure: Everstone partnered with the American real estate investment firm, Realterm Group to create IndoSpace Logistic Parks. In 2017 and 2018 respectively, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore-based GLP, partnered with IndoSpace to enter the Indian market.
* Venture Capital: In 2013, the company formed DSG Consumer Partner, a joint venture with Deepak Shahdadpuri, which invests in early-stage consumer businesses in India and Southeast Asia.
