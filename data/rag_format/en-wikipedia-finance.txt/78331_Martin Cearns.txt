# Martin Cearns



**Martin William Cearns** (April 1945 – May 2024) was an English football executive who was chairman of West Ham United.


## Life and career

Cearns was born in April 1945. A bank manager with Barclays Bank, Cearns became a board member with West Ham taking over the chairmanship in 1990 from his father, Len Cearns. He held the position until 1992 when it was taken over by Terry Brown. Although no longer chairman, Cearns remained on the board until 1 December 2006 when he resigned when the club was sold to Icelandic billionaire, Björgólfur Guðmundsson for £85 million. As part of the takeover he made £7.76 million from the sale of his 1,844,000 shares in West Ham.

Cearns' time at West Ham is remembered for his advocacy, with Peter Storrie, of the Hammers Bond scheme, a financial bond which West Ham fans would have been forced to buy before being allowed to purchase a season ticket. The proposal led to demonstrations both inside and outside West Ham's ground and to pitch invasions.

West Ham announced Cearns' death on 7 May 2024, at the age of 79.
