**Harte Hanks** is a global marketing services company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Harte Hanks services include analytics, strategy, marketing technology, creative services, digital marketing, customer care, direct mail, logistics, and fulfillment.


## History

Founded by Houston Harte and Bernard Hanks in 1923 as **Harte-Hanks Newspapers** (and later **Harte-Hanks Communications**), the company spent its first 50 years operating newspapers in Texas. In 1968, the company relocated from Abilene to San Antonio. It made its first IPO on March 8, 1972, later diversifying into television and radio properties. In 1984, the company's managers took it private, later going public again in 1993. In the mid-1990s, the company withdrew from the newspaper and broadcasting business and focused solely on direct marketing and shopper publications.


### Newspapers

Harte Hanks' first newspapers were Hanks' *Abilene Reporter-News* and Harte's *San Angelo Standard*. Other early acquisitions in the 1920s and 1930s included the *Harlingen Star*, *Corpus Christi Times*, *Big Spring Herald* and *Paris News*. The company incorporated as **Harte-Hanks Newspapers, Inc.** in 1948.

The company bought two competing newspapers in Greenville, Texas in the mid-1950s, consolidating them into the *Herald-Banner* after two years of fierce rivalry. A court case followed, with Harte Hanks accused of unfair competition. The chain was acquitted of the charges in 1959.

In 1962, the company took full ownership of *San Antonio Express-News*, its largest circulation newspaper. The *Express-News* was one of the first properties Harte Hanks sold off, however, as it began to narrow its focus to smaller newspapers and eventually to direct marketing. Rupert Murdoch paid $19 million for the *Express-News* in 1973.

At the time of the first IPO in 1972, the firm owned properties in 19 markets across six states. The paper expanded outside of Texas that year with the purchase of the *Anderson Independent* and *Anderson Daily Mail* of Anderson, South Carolina, merging them into the *Anderson Independent-Mail*.

By 1980, the company owned 29 daily and 68 weekly newspapers.

In 1995, Harte Hanks sold to Community Newspaper Company its interest in the Massachusetts-based *Middlesex News*, two other dailies, and associated weeklies in the western suburbs of Boston. It had owned the *News* since 1972 and bought the *News-Tribune* and *Daily Transcript* in 1986.

The Abilene, Anderson, Corpus Christi, and San Angelo papers were among the last remaining Harte Hanks newspaper properties and were sold to E. W. Scripps Company in May 1997. Scripps spun out its newspaper assets into Journal Media Group in April 2015. Journal was then absorbed into Gannett in April 2016.


### Television and radio

The company made its first foray into other media as early as 1962, when Harte Hanks bought KENS-AM-TV, San Antonio's CBS radio and television affiliates, as part of its acquisition of the *Express-News*. Harte Hanks turned KENS from a perennial ratings also-ran to the market leader by 1968. In the 1970s, the newspaper-dominated company further diversified its holdings by purchasing the WAIM radio and TV stations in Anderson as part of its purchase of the *Independent* and *Mail*, as well as television stations in Jacksonville, Florida, Greensboro, North Carolina, and Springfield, Missouri. In 1978, Harte Hanks bought radio stations formerly owned by Southern Broadcasting. In 1980, the company's broadcast holdings were four television stations, 11 radio stations and four cable television systems. It sold off most of these assets in the mid-1980s to pay down debt incurred in the leveraged buyout that took the company private. Harte Hanks continued to hold KENS until 1997, when it and the company's remaining newspaper properties were sold to Scripps.
