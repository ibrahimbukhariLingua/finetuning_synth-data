Hong Kong–Liechtenstein relations


# Hong Kong–Liechtenstein relations



**Hong Kong–Liechtenstein relations** refers to international relations between Hong Kong and Liechtenstein.


## History

As Liechtenstein and Hong Kong both grew around highly specialized industrial firms after the two World wars, as well being active in the international financial sector, Hong Kong has gradually developed among Liechtenstein's most important partners in Asia.

Liechtenstein's presence in Hong Kong has strengthened since the late 20th Century. For example, Hilti, a Liechtenstein producer of precision power tools, started business in Hong Kong in 1974. It was followed by the Princely family of Liechtenstein's private bank, LGT, in 1986. As one of the most notable Liechtensteiners in Hong Kong, H.S.H. Hereditary Prince Alois von und zu Liechtenstein, the Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein, son of H.S.H. Prince Hans-Adam II von und zu Liechtenstein, spent three months in Hong Kong at the end of 1987 and the beginning of 1988 as an officer of the Coldstream Guards during his military career posted by the British Royal Military Academy.

The Liechtenstein Honorary Consulate in Hong Kong was opened in 2013, which according to the government of Liechtenstein, would "allow both countries to deepen their relations, especially in the areas of finance and exports." Liechtenstein does not have any diplomatic representation in Asia. The honorary consulate in Hong Kong is one of the only two Liechtenstein Honorary Consulates in Asia, the other being Singapore.


## Trade and Agreement

Liechtenstein and Hong Kong maintain well integrated and engaged economic relations. Both Liechtenstein and Hong Kong have been members of the World Trade Organization since 1995.
