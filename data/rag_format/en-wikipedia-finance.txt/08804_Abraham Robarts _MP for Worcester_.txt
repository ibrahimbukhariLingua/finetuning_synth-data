**Abraham Robarts** (27 September 1745 – 26 November 1816) was an English banker and politician. He was a factor in the West Indies trade, and a director of the East India Company.


## Early life

Robarts was born on 27 September 1745, a son of Capt. Abraham Robarts of Stepney, Middlesex, by the former Elizabeth Wildey (daughter and heiress of Samuel Wildey of Stepney).


## Career

Early in his career he was a partner with James Tierney in the firm of Tierney, Lilly and Robarts, Spanish merchants.

He became a Director of the Royal Exchange Insurance Company from 1781 to 1786 and then served as a director of the East India Company six times between 1786 and 1815, normally for three years each time.
