## History

First established in 1956, the UBC Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration was renamed UBC Sauder School of Business in 2003, in recognition of a donation of a $20 million endowment by William Sauder.

Following a donation from Vancouver business philanthropist Robert H. Lee, the Robert H. Lee Graduate School was established at UBC Sauder in 2006 to support graduate-level education.

In 2012, the UBC Sauder School of Business completed a major renovation to its Henry Angus Building on the UBC campus, adding 55,000 square feet to the original 216,000 square-foot building. The renovation was designed by Acton Ostry Architects and added the Cannacord Learning Commons, Wayne Dean Investment Analysis Centre, and the Bruce Birmingham Undergraduate Centre along with new classrooms and a conference center.
