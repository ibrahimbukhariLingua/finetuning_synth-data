Party of Business


# Party of Business



The **Party of Business** (Russian: Партия дела, romanized: *Partiya dela*, aka "Party of the Cause") is a political party in Russia whose main goal is to promote "economic expediency". The party was founded on October 14, 2010, and officially registered on December 14, 2012. The party has described itself as "neither a right-wing nor a left-wing party" and "open to all ideas that would help us improve the social and economic situation in our country." It opposed and spoke out against the decline of Russian agriculture, and called for its revival and expansion. It also supported a reduction of the price of Russian gas and oil, and an income tax that increases based upon the average salary of Russian citizens. The party’s activities were suspended by Russia’s Supreme Court in April 2024 after violations were found in the party’s charter. On 18 October 2024, Russia’s Ministry of Justice requested to dissolve the party; this request will be considered in November 2024.


## History

On September 22, 2010, a group of economists and businessmen declared that a new party under the name "Party Action" would soon be organized.

On October 14, 2010, in the Izmailovo Hotel in Moscow, the founding congress of the party took place, where 160 delegates from 51 regions of Russia approved the program and the charter of the party.

The first regional branch of the party was formed on November 10, 2010, in Bashkortostan. By December 1, 2010, regional branches had been formed in 42 constituents of Russia, which gave the party the status of an "All-Russian political party."

On December 27, 2010, the party submitted documents for registration to the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation. In February 2011, the party was denied registration. The decision of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation was appealed in court.

On October 31, 2012, delegates from the regional branches of Russia held a Constituent Congress, where it was decided that the "Party of Business," an All-Russian political party, would be created, and its Charter and Program were approved as well.

On March 5, 2015, the party members held the II Congress in Kostroma intending to accept new members to the Federal Council and a new version of the Program.

The party’s activities were suspended by Russia’s Supreme Court in April 2024 after violations were found in the party’s charter.
