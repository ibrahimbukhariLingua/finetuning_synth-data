## Early life

Remick was born on East Boston, Massachusetts on October 14, 1866. He was a son of Joseph Remick and Mary Ann Pickering (née Hammond) Remick. Among his siblings was Joseph Remick of Pillsbury, Remick & Co. of Boston and Frank W. Remick, a member of Kidder, Peabody & Co. who served as president of the Boston Stock Exchange while William was president of the New York Stock Exchange.

His maternal grandparents were Mary (née Kennard) Hammond and Captain William Hammond, who resided at Bolt Hill and was representative to the legislature, county commissioner and register of probate.

In 1893, he became associated with R.L. Day & Co. in Boston. Two years later, he opened their New York office before becoming a partner in 1903. In 1913, he established his own investment banking firm, Remick, Hodges & Co. located at 14 Wall Street. In 1917, he was made chairman of the second Liberty Loan drive Committee of stock exchange houses and continued as chairman during succeeding loan drives.

In 1907, he purchased his seat on the New York Stock Exchange and in 1909, he was chosen to serve on the Exchange's Board of Governors, a position he retained until his death in 1922. While on the Board, he served on various committees, including the Committees on Laws, Finance, Stock Lists, Ways and Means, and as Chairman of the Committees on Insolvencies and on Admissions. From May 1919 to May 1921, he served as president of the New York Stock Exchange. The period of Remick's presidency of the Exchange was "exceptionally trying due to the banking situation in the Fall of 1919 and the strain on the credit structure of the country." In April 1921, Remick stated to a group of visitors to the Exchange that "the gradual development of the country through the railroads and industrial enterprises was made possible by the liquid wealth of the Eastern section of the country." He added that "your Governing Committee is doing the utmost to safeguard the public in every way possible and that the code of ethics and the sense of fair dealing of the members of the Exchange is as high--yes, higher--than is found in any business of the country." He was succeeded by his vice-president, Seymour L. Cromwell.

A Republican, Remick also served as a director of the Stock Clearing House Corporation, the Submarine Boat Corporation, the Electric Boat Company, the New York Railways Company, and a trustee of the Dry Dock Savings Institution. At the time of his death, he was a senior member of his investment bank, Remick, Hodges & Co.
