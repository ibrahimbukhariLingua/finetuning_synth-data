In Algeria, the most important sources of government revenue have been oil and gas royalties.


## Taxation

The current Algerian tax system consists of 2 regimes, the real and fixed regimes. This distinction issued from the reform implemented in 2007 when the taxation was revised. The main incentive to review the taxes was that after the 2000s energy crisis, taxes became the main resource of national income. That is why the incentive to work on its effectivity and to optimize it appeared in government.

The fixed regime relies on the single fixed tax (the main change and innovation made by this reform) and the real regime consist of different taxes levied on taxpayer.


### History

From the historical point of view the Algerian tax system seems to be inspired by its former coloniser- France. Actually as a whole system it looks to be the reproduction of the French base by implementing different modalities of taxation (imposition).

There are different taxes levied:

* Income tax; this one is progressive and categorical
* Corporate profit tax
* Tax on the professional activity
* Property tax
* Value added tax and Interior consumption tax
* Real estate tax
* Oil's products tax

### Tax system

The current tax system was changed and reformed several time. The very important, radical and innovative change happened in 2007 when the tax system was significantly reformed. The main fruit of this reform is the Single fixed tax.
This new notion appears and was introduced as the simplification of the system with hope that it improves the fiscal situation and makes the system working more effectively. This fixed tax was established as the one single tax instead of 3 different taxes levied on every institution. The government's target is to improve the transparency, accessibility and justice in taxes.


## Single Fixed Tax

This single fixed tax covers: Value added tax, professional activity tax, global income tax. The single fixed tax was established for the most numerous group of taxpayers at the level of 5% for production and sale and 12% for any other activities. This reform covers people, network service providers, retailers, merchants, societies, enterprises, investors and all taxpayers with the turnover up to 30,000,000 DZD (US$263,400). This taxes is levied over the biennial period (lasting 2 years)
Grouping of these different taxes makes the mechanism easier. It is easier for tax authorities to control and levy the taxes on this group of taxpayers.
Taxpayers have to present in the period of 1 to 30 June every year the backward-looking sales/income report. Tax can be paid in whole amount or in 3 payments. The 1st payment in the beginning and then 25% in the period of the 1st till 15 September and the 25% left from 1 to 15 December.


## Real Regime

The real regim consists of different taxes levied:

1. Income tax; this one is progressive and categorical

3. Business activity tax
4. Personal property
5. Value added tax and Interior consumption tax
6. Real estate tax
7. Petroleum products tax

Then there are categorical withholding tax rates at source. This one changes in function of the category the income belongs to. There is different classes with own scale within every classes so the tax varies between classes and within them at the same time.
