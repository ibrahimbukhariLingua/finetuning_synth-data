The plants produce wet pet food in aluminium and steel cans at a rate of 1,000 cans per minute, or 1,110 85-gram pouches per minute. Jointly, the plants are able to produce over one billion containers a year. In the same year the company's revenue was US$1 billion.

In April 2014, plans were announced to expand product at the Emporia site.

## Controversy

On November 1, 2017, the ACLU of Oklahoma named Simmons and several other companies in a class action lawsuit on behalf of past participants at the Drug and Alcohol Recovery Program facilities in Tahlequah, Oklahoma and Decatur, Arkansas. The filing asserted that Simmons knowingly benefited from human trafficking and other labor violations. The filing is consistent with investigative journalism work conducted by Reveal (part of Centers for Investigative Reporting) and The Oklahoman. The Oklahoman specifically mentioned Simmons Food as a place where the rehabilitation program participants were being sent. Reveal's investigation into the labor conditions have alleged that Simmons has become so reliant on this forced labor that their plants would shut down if participants from these programs did not show up. The ACLU has also filed suit against Simmons in Arkansas regarding similar allegations. On January 11, 2018, all claims against Simmons were voluntarily dismissed. On December 10, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma in the Case of Arthur Copeland, et al., issued an opinion and order dismissing the case. On May 1, 2023 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit reversed and remanded the decision of the District Court, finding that the alleged conduct of Simmons Foods and CAAIR was not excluded from federal jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.

In 2022, Simmons Foods was named as one of nineteen companies accused by Washington State of conspiracy to artificially inflate for price of chicken.
