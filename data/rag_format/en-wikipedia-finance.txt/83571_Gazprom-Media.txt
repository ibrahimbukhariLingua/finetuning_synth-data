## History

In 2000 with pressure from Mikhail Lesin, Gazprom-Media acquired NTV, the only nationwide state-independent television in Russia at the time, as well as other media assets of Vladimir Gusinsky's *Media Most* group including the satellite operator NTV-plus, TNT-Teleset, the radio station Echo of Moscow (Ekho Moskvy), and the Seven days (publishing house) [ru] (Семь дней) publishing house, which raised a major controversy and resulted in considerable changes to its editorial policy.

After Gazprom-Media took over "Media Most" in 2000, Gazprom-Media received Filipp Bobkov's entire former KGB 5th directorate (Political police), including all its thousands of employees, its database, and the security service founded by Bobkov that was accused of attempting to assassinate Boris Berezovsky in 1994. The entire archive of 5th KGB Main Directorate was taken to Media-Most. In 2000, Bobkov created the *Institute for Strategic Assessments and Analysis (ISOA)* (Russian: Институт стратегических оценок и анализа (ИСОА)), a joint stock company (JSC). It operated as a think tank successor to Media Most's security department with the former head of KGB in Azerbaijan Vaqif Hüseynov [ru] (Russian: Вагиф Алиовсат оглы Гусейнов, b. born November 27, 1942, Quba, Azerbaijan). The director of ISOA from 2001 to 2002 Vladimir Zhizhin [ru] was chairman of the board.

In 2005, Gazprom-Media purchased *Izvestia*, a leading nationwide newspaper. In May 2008, Sergei Fursenko's National Media Group [ru] gained a 50.1% stake in *Izvestia*.

For 37.22 billion rubles in August 2005, Gazprom-Media Holdings was sold to Gazprombank. In 2012 OJSC Gazprom owned a 41.73% stake in Gazprombank and NPF Gazfond owned a 46.92% stake in Gazprom. As of 2012, most of the stake in Yuri Shamalov's associated Gazfond is managed by Anatoly Gavrilenko's Leader (management company) [ru] (Russian: ЗАО «Лидер») a management company which is part of the SOGAZ insurance group controlled by the Vladimir Putin associated Rossiya Bank. Yuri Kovalchuk is its largest shareholder. In March 2014, Rossiya Bank sold its indirect control of Lider to Gasfond which owns a 45% stake in Lider. As of November 2014, Gasfond is the largest shareholder in Gazprombank which controls Gazprom-Media.
