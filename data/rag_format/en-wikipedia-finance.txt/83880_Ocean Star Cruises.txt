**Ocean Star Cruises** is a Mexican cruise line based in Mexico City. It was founded in 2010, the first Mexican cruise line. The first ship in its fleet was the MV Ocean Star Pacific (launched on 9 July 1970 for RCCL), purchased in December 2010 to become the first ship in the fleet. It officially entered service on April 10, 2011. The cruise ship sailed the waters of the Mexican Riviera, with embarkation ports at Acapulco and Manzanillo. The company planned to expand its fleet to include six additional newly built vessels in the next 5 years. Ocean Star Cruises no longer operates any cruise ships as of 2012.
