Consumer Council


# Consumer Council



The **Consumer Council** is an independent statutory authority in Hong Kong, established in 1974 and formalised in April 1977 under the Consumer Council Ordinance (Cap. 216). Its role is to enhance consumer welfare and empower consumers to protect themselves. Over the course of the past four decades the expansion in the council's duties and services on consumer protection, such as the publishing of the CHOICE Magazine in 1976, the recent launch of online price-watching tools, and conducting studies on different aspects of the consumer market, have coincided with the socio-economic development of Hong Kong. Apart from being a consumer advisor, it has assumed the role as a key stakeholder in making of consumer-related policies.

The chairman, vice-chairman, and members of the council are all appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR for renewable terms of two years.

### Overview

The establishment and development over the years of the Consumer Council have largely coincided with the socio-economic growth of Hong Kong.

The Consumer Council was established amidst the trend of the proliferation of statutory bodies in Hong Kong. In the 1970s, with the aim of improving the efficiency of governance, the Hong Kong government started establishing a large number of statutory bodies, which can be divided into five categories, namely: (i) policy committee, (ii) bodies that assist economic development, (iii) bodies that monitor socio-economic activities, (iv) bodies that monitor human rights situation, government performance, and reflect public opinions, and (v) bodies that carry out administrative orders. These independent and self-run statutory bodies are vested with power delegated by the government, which only sent official delegates to these bodies as mediators but not policy-instructors. They were also part of “the administrative absorption of politics” to secure policy legitimacy.

In 2003, to improve the “openness, effectiveness, representativeness and transparency” of statutory bodies, the Home Affairs Bureau issued a Consultation Paper on the Review of the Role and Functions of Public Sector Advisory and Statutory Bodies. In 2004, the Interim Report on the Review of the Classification System of Advisory and Statutory Bodies in the Public Sector designated the Consumer Council as a “non-departmental public bodies”, i.e. non-commercial entities that deliver public services at arm's length from the Government.


### The 1970s: The Establishment of the Consumer Council

In light of the high inflation rate due to the global oil crisis in the 1970s, there were significant discrepancies in the qualities of essential daily necessities. Therefore, the Consumer Council was founded to protect the consumer by monitoring the quality of products and services on the market.

| 1974 | The Establishment of the Consumer Council The Consumer Council was established in April 1974. At the establishment of the Consumer Council, it broadcast the “Daily Bulletin of Retail Prices of Major Foodstuffs” every morning on the radio, offering information on price comparison to consumers. |
| --- | --- |
| 1975 | The Launch of Diversified Services The Consumer Monthly Newsletter, the forerunner of the CHOICE Magazine, was first published in 1975, with an initial print of 30,000 copies for free distribution. Apart from publications, the Consumer Council opened two Consumer Advice Centres in Wan Chai and Sham Shui Po District Offices. |
| 1977 | Status of the Consumer Council The Consumer Council Ordinance (Cap.216) was enacted in 1977, and the council was formally incorporated into a statutory body, defining the council's functions and powers. The council has also become a member of the Consumers International (formerly known as the International Organization of Consumers Unions (IOCU)), an organization for consumer groups around the world. |
| 1977 - 1979 | Public Education At the international level, after joining the IOCU, the Council co-organized the first Consumer Education Seminar with IOCU with the theme of “the Law and the Consumer”. The seminar has engaged delegates from over 20 countries and regions. At the local level, the Council collaborated with the Education Bureau (formerly known as the Education Department) to create a consumer education teaching kit that was widely adopted in school education. Moreover, it has organised a series of seminars with diverse topics to promote consumer rights. |


### The 1980s: Foundation for the Consumer Protection Legislations

In the 1980s, Hong Kong's economy was in the transition from secondary production to tertiary production. Meanwhile, there was increased consumer awareness of service quality. As a result, the Council handled numerous complaints. With this in mind, the council had proposed numerous suggestions for various consumer protection laws.

| 1981 - 1989 | Implementation of Key Consumer Protection Legislations The council has been advocating for the enactment of several consumer protection legislation. During this period, numerous consumer protection legislation such as the Trade Descriptions Ordinance and the Travel Agents Ordinance came into effect. Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap. 362) was enacted on 1 April 1981, aiming to prohibit false trade descriptions or misleading information about goods and services provided by traders. As for Travel Agents Ordinance (Cap. 218), it was enacted on 13 December 1985 with the aim to provide for the control and regulation of travel agents. However, due to the closure of major travel agencies between 1986 and 1987, the council's proposals for redress measures were accepted, and the Travel Agents Ordinance was amended accordingly. Further, the New Weights and Measures Ordinance (Cap. 68) was enacted on 1 January 1989 to provide units and standards of measurement and weighing equipment used for trade. |

### The 1990s: Foundation for Advocating Fair Competition in the Market and Enhanced Consumer Protection

With Hong Kong's rising status as the financial centre of Asia, the council had conducted various research on significant consumer and investor protection policies. As the Council plays an essential role in protecting consumer interests, the Council recognized that consumers might require assistance in pursuing their rights for consumer protection. Therefore, the Consumer Legal Action Fund was set up.

| 1991 | Publicity Campaign The council launched an extensive publicity campaign to promote consumers' rights to the public with the slogan “Your consumer rights are in your hands. Speak up to fight for your rights!”. The advertisement with Dodo Cheng and Ng Man-tat had gained public recognition. |
| --- | --- |
| 1994 | The Consumer Legal Action Fund The Consumer Legal Action Fund was established in December 1994 with an initial grant of HK$10 million from the Government to facilitate consumer access to legal remedies through providing legal assistance to consumers. The council is the trustee of the Fund and is advised by a Management Committee on the merits of the cases seeking legal assistance under the Fund. |
| 1997 | Establishment of the Estate Agents Authority Followed by the council's recommendations on the licensing of estate agents to the Government, the Estate Agents Authority (“EAA”) was established in November 1997 with the enactment of the Estate Agents Ordinance (Cap. 511). Representatives of the council were appointed as members of the EAA's Committees and Working Groups. |
| 1999 | Co-organising the First Consumer Culture Study Award The Council started to co-organize the Consumer Culture Study Award with the Education Bureau in 1999. The award is designed for local secondary school students to explore consumer cultures, attitudes, and behaviours by generating study reports and collecting first-hand data. |


### The 2000s: Launch of Different Tools and Support

In the 2000s, Hong Kong was hit by SARS and a financial tsunami that had a massive impact on the economy. As a result, people became more concerned about the price of different products. The Council continued to provide information on product tests and launched different tools to assist consumers in their daily lives.

| 2008 | Standardised Definition of Saleable Area The council and nine organisations jointly proposed the standardised method for measuring the saleable area in the 1980s. With the joint efforts, a standardised definition of “Saleable Area” took effect in October 2008 and was applicable to sales brochures and sales and purchase agreements. This helps potential buyers to gain more accurate information on the area of the property. |

| 2009 | Launch of the Auto-fuel Price Calculator In light of rising auto-fuel prices, the Council developed an online Auto-fuel Price Calculation in February, providing consumers with a platform to compare the auto-fuel prices of five local oil companies. Subsequently, in April, a mobile version of the Auto-fuel Price Calculator was launched. |
| 2009 | Launch of the Monthly Wet Market Food Price Index The council launched the Monthly Wet Market Food Price Index in September to monitor the price level of 26 food items in 44 wet markets across 18 districts. This laid a foundation for further development of the Online Price Watch. |


### The 2010s: The Council’s Focus in response to Technological Advancement

In the 2010s, online shopping became prevalent due to technological advancement. Therefore, consumers were more aware of sustainable consumption and personal data privacy. In response to the changing needs of consumers, the council also published information via diversified channels.

| 2010 | The New Nutrition Labelling Scheme The new Nutrition Labelling Scheme came into effect on 1 July 2010, which helps consumers understand the nutritional content of food and make healthier food choices. The Council conducted surveys on the new Nutrition Labelling Scheme from March to July. Additionally, in collaboration with the Centre for Food Safety, the Council promoted the new scheme to the public. |

| 2014 | Celebrating the 40th Anniversary The Council celebrated its 40th anniversary with a series of events and educational programmes, such as the 40th Anniversary cocktail reception, where nearly 500 distinguished guests attended the event. Educational programmes, including a Comic Exhibition and an RTHK TV Programme, “Metropolitan Consumers”, were rolled out to discuss consumer protection issues in different generations. |
| 2018 | Launch of YouTube Channel The council has set up a YouTube channel where consumers can access information in different ways. |
| 2019 | Mainland Collaboration and Cross-border Co-operative Agreements with the Greater Bay Area Since there are frequent cross-boundary trades and consumer activities, the Council reached an agreement with the China Consumers’ Association (CCA) to build closer partnerships especially in handling consumer complaints. To enhance the cross-border cooperation in consumer protection and rights between Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau, the Council signed Memoranda of Understanding with 9 Mainland municipalities. This facilitates cooperation in the Greater Bay Area by providing an operational framework and arrangements for information exchange. |
| 2019 | Consumer Education for Senior Citizens Community talks targeted at senior citizens were held with social service organisations to educate senior citizens about consumer rights. Moreover, the Council collaborated with TVB to produce elderly health management-related content in the TV programme “Revel in Retirement” (無耆不有). |


### The 2020s: The Council Proactive Response to Coronavirus Pandemic

In 2020, Hong Kong was adversely affected by COVID-19 and faced an unprecedented challenge. Hence, the Council focused on testing various anti-epidemic products and providing the latest consumer information to consumers.

| 2020 | Webpage “Together, We Fight the Virus!” A one-stop webpage, "Together, We Fight the Virus!", was launched to provide reliable and credible information for consumers on anti-epidemic products. In addition, the council has been conducting product tests on numerous anti-epidemic products such as disinfection alcohol, Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits and face masks. The public is free to download test findings of these anti-epidemic gears. |

| 2020 | Launch of the New "Oil Price Watch" A new Oil Price Watch was launched on both the website and mobile application with enhanced functions in November 2020. It offers information for consumers to check the auto-fuel retail prices of oil companies to help consumers choose among various kinds of promotions and discounts. |


## Performance pledge

Same as many other statutory bodies, such as the Airport Authority Hong Kong, and governmental bureaus and departments, the Consumer Council sets up its performance pledge. The mechanism was modelled on the UK's citizen's charters and introduced by the government in Hong Kong in 1992 to instil a customer orientation mindset among the public sector and enhance the quality of public service. Performance reporting is an important means by which the Hong Kong government controls the operations of statutory bodies in a less intrusive manner to respect the bodies’ independence.


## Organisation Structure

### Overview

The operation of the Consumer Council is supported by a number of committees and working groups established to deal with specific areas of consumer issues, including products testing, information technology, trade practices, legal protection, etc. Members of the committees are professionals and stakeholders drawn from different sectors of the society to provide fair and just expertise. Full Council meetings are held on a bi-monthly basis.


### Council Members

The chairman, Vice-chairman, and members are all appointed by the Government of the HKSAR for a term not exceeding 2 years. They may be reappointed upon the expiry of their respective terms of office. The currentʷʰᵉⁿ? chairman and chief executive of the council are Paul Lam and Ms. Gilly Wong Fung-han respectively.


### Chairmen of the Council

Statutory bodies provide a basis for a certain extent of public participation in the policy process through the government's appointment. There has been academic discussion that the colonial government before and during the transitional period up to the Handover had been prioritising the interest of business and professional elites in the appointment of leaders of Hong Kong's advisory and statutory bodies. As shown below, some of the chairmen of the consumer rights-safeguarding Council pre-handover were affiliated with business or professional sectors (particularly legal service), with the remaining ones having political affiliations, and civil or public service experience.

| 13 | July 2022 – | Clement Chan Kam-wing | Accountant, Former President of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants |

From 2003 to 2006, the government did propose to widen the participation of various social groups, such as youth, women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, in statutory bodies. From the list above, whilst some of the appointees post-handover remain to be elites from different professions (particularly legal service) and business sectors, there were also politicians from across the spectrum, educators, and experienced individuals in the public sector.


### Chief Executives of the Council

All of the Chief Executives of the council (former and current) have had experience in management in civil and public service, with their career spanning across different statutory bodies.

| Period | Chief Executive | Occupation; Background |
| --- | --- | --- |

| 16 November 2012 – | Ms Gilly Wong Fung-han | * Management and public service - former General Manager of MICE & Cruise of the Hong Kong Tourism Board |


## Finance

As a not-for-profit funded statutory body, the Consumer Council derives its income mostly from Government subvention through the operational expenses of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (Commerce, Tourism and Industry Branch). Meanwhile, proceeds from the sales of the CHOICE Magazine and interest income accounted for only a small portion, with 3.3% of the council's income in the Year 2020-2021 generated in this manner. The total recurrent and non-recurrent expenditures for the Year 2020-2021 were HK$132.49 million and HK$11.98 million respectively. For the fiscal year ended on 31 March 2021, the council was running at a financial surplus of HK$4,974,749. The current estimate for the council's expenditure in the fiscal year of 2021-2022 is around HK$133,919,000 as reported by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau to the Legislative Council in April 2022.

Whilst governmental funding provides a source of autonomy for statutory bodies like the Consumer Council, there has been scholarly discussion that such independence may be more symbolic than actual, as the amount of funding can limit the bodies’ operations.
