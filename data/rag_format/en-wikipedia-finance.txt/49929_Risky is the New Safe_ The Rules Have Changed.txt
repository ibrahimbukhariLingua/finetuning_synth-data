## Overview

*Risky is the New Safe* promotes the concept of resisting conventional thinking in a continuously changing economy. The book covers factors and mindsets that are required to succeed. Exactly as the title suggests, the book considers risk taking to be the new way of securing safety in a market or life in general. It suggests that doing nothing or going for the safer options results not only in lost opportunity but also leaves you vulnerable towards unforeseen risks that you would be taking anyway in anycase and, thus, explores the approach of intentionally taking risks as the rules of the society and markets have changed with disruptive technologies changing everything at a fast pace. According to Gage, "The reality is most people today are automatons, blindly following the herd through the motions of life," he writes. "Instead of being afraid of being contrarian, you should be afraid if youâ€™re not," he writes. "Not only is risky the new safe in the new economy," he continues, "weird is the new normal."

The book further focuses on learning from other multimillionaires, accelerating education, branding and social media and ideas among other things.

*Risky is the New Safe* was listed among the *New York Times* best sellers as well as Reuters best sellers in 2012. The book was also a top best seller in *The Wall Street Journal*.
