## History

Starting as the Ottoman Bank on 1 November 1956, ibq underwent several ownerships in its history.

In 1969 the Ottoman Bank sold its branches to the National and Grindlays Bank which later became known as Grindlays. In 1989, the bank changed names again to ANZ Grindlays when it was acquired by the Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. In 2000, Standard Chartered acquired ANZ Grindlays.

In August 2004, the bank was renamed International Bank of Qatar (ibq), when National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) acquired a 20% stake in the bank and assumed management responsibilities. In July 2007, NBK increased its share of the bank to 30% and sold them back to Qatari investors in 2014.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
