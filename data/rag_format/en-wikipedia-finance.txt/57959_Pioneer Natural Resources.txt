### Acquisition by ExxonMobil

In May 2024, in the largest merger in the petroleum industry in 20 years, Pioneer was acquired by ExxonMobil, making ExxonMobil the largest producer of shale gas in the Permian Basin.

Approval for the transaction from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was accompanied by a consent order alleging that former Pioneer CEO Scott D. Sheffield colluded with OPEC to raise oil prices and making the merger conditional on Sheffield's being barred from joining ExxonMobil's board of directors or serving as an advisor to Exxon after the merger.


### Antitrust lawsuit

In January 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed by drivers in three US states accusing Pioneer, along with seven other oil and gas producers, of an illegal price fixing scheme to constrain production of shale oil that led to American drivers paying more for gasoline than they would have in a competitive market. In May 2024, plaintiffs asked for the communications records of former CEO Scott Sheffield.
