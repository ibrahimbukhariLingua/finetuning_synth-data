### Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box

Bob Deitrick along with Lew Goldfarb published *Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box* on July 1, 2012. The book examines presidents Herbert Hoover through Barack Obama, ranking them according to their performance in three distinct economic categories. The authors review 80 years of our nation's economic history from the Great Depression and Herbert Hoover to the Great Recession and George W. Bush; a time period in which the Democratic and Republican Parties occupied the Oval Office for 40 years each. Adam Hartung of Forbes said of the book, "Their compendium of economic facts is the most illuminating document on economic performance during different administrations, and policies, than anything previously published." Hartung has written five articles in tandem with Bob Deitrick and Steven Morgan, of Polaris Financial Partners, which have produced, in aggregate, 2 million views between the five articles with Hartung and they rank #â€™s 1,3, and 4 among Hartung's most popular articles in Forbes. Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box has been featured in Forbes, the International Business Times, The Christian Science Monitor and U.S. News & World Report among many others publications, and the book has been endorsed by David Wilhelm, former chairman of the DNC, and Governor Ted Strickland of Ohio.
