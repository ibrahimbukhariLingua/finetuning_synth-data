# Osaka Business Park Station



**Osaka Business Park Station** (大阪ビジネスパーク駅, *Ōsaka Bijinesu Pāku-eki*) is a metro station on the Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line in Chūō-ku, Osaka, Japan. With a depth of 32.3 m (106 ft), it is the deepest station in the Osaka subway system.


## Line

* Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line (Station Number: N21)

## Layout

There is an island platform fenced with platform gates between 2 tracks underground.

Originally, the plan was to use prebuilt platforms located at the first basement level. However due to its location adjacent to the nearby Neyagawa and Daini Neyagawa rivers, the city ordered the construction of the current platforms to be at least 10 m (33 ft) below the nearby rivers. The original platforms remain in place, albeit accessible only through the side of an existing staircase.
