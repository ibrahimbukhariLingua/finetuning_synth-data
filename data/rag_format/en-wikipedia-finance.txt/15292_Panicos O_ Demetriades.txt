## Academic research

Demetriades's academic work focuses on the relationship between finance and growth as well as the interactions between public and private capital and productivity. His early work on finance and growth challenged the view that growth in the financial system is, by itself, sufficient to deliver more economic growth and emphasised the importance of good institutions. Moreover, he has shown that, where present, the contribution of the banking sector to growth is more significant than that of equity finance through the stock market. More recent work has challenged widely held views about government owned banks by showing that, far from acting as an obstacle to growth, such banks can actually enhance both financial and economic development. His work on public capital contradicts the 'crowding out' argument often used by mainstream economists to justify cuts in public spending and reduce the size of government. Specifically, he shows that public investment can actually promote the productivity of the private sector and stimulate trade, employment and long run growth. In this sense, his work has a distinctly Keynesian flavour, influenced by new Keynesians such as Joseph Stiglitz. Although his work can be classified as macroeconomics, he also utilises both micro-data and micro-econometrics. His academic work has been influential, as evidenced by over 8,000 citations in Google Scholar. According to the RePEc rankings, he is ranked among the top 1% of the world's most widely read economists as well as the top 5% of economic authors worldwide based on criteria like average rank score, number of works number of distinct works, number of citations etc.
