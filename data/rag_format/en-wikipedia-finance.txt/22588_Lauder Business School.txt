## History and development

In 2003 the Ronald Lauder Foundation established the Lauder Business School, under its President Ronald S. Lauder. Vienna as a location was chosen as a bridge between western and eastern traditions and to form an international University. During the first years of its existence, Lauder Business School offered an 8-semester Magister degree in *International Marketing and Management*, but since 2007 students have been accepted to two new programmes: a 6-semester Bachelor and a 4-semester Master's. At the moment, the university offers one Bachelor in *International Business Administration*, a master's degree in *International Management and Leadership* and one in *Strategic Finance and Business Analytics, and an online MBA in Executive Management*.


## Campus

Lauder Business School has one campus, which includes a main building with classrooms, library, an administration building, auditoriums, a dining building and a student residence (in cooperation with Jewish Heritage Center). The main part which is located in the north has a size of 1.200 m² that provides enough space for lecture- and seminar rooms. Another 750 m² are used as office space. At the southern end of the park the student residence is located. They are all located in the Döbling district of Vienna, between Pyrkergasse and Hofzeile.
These buildings (except one for the auditorium and dining room, which was built especially for the school) comprise a former palace of Maria Theresa, given to her by Charles IV and built by Nicolò Pacassi.
Later the building was owned by members of the Rothschild family and served as a hospital.
The Bank Austria Creditanstalt Auditorium was built in 2003 and is dedicated to Gerhard Randa, former chairman of BA-CA.
The conversion and extension of the baroque ensemble of Lauder Business School was done by Kuhn Malvezzi, a Berlin-based architecture bureau.
