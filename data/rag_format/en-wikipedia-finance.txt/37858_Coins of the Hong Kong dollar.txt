Coins of the Hong Kong dollar


# Coins of the Hong Kong dollar



The **Hong Kong coinage**, including 10¢, 20¢, 50¢, $1, $2, $5 & $10, is issued by Hong Kong Monetary Authority on behalf of the Government of Hong Kong. From 1863 until 1992, these coins were embossed with the reigning British monarch's effigy. Since 1 January 1993, a new series depicting the bauhinia flower was gradually issued, including a new denomination of $10. Since the beginning of the coin replacement programme on 1 January 1993, over 585 million coins featuring Queen Elizabeth II have been withdrawn from circulation. However, these coins remain legal tender.
The total value of coins in circulation in Hong Kong can be found in Monthly Statistical Bulletin and the Annual Report.

| Denomination | Details |
| --- | --- |

| Five-cent coin | From 1866 to 1933, the five-cent coin was struck in silver. After Hong Kong abandoned the silver standard in 1935, the coin's composition was changed to copper-nickel, and later nickel-brass in 1949 until its final issue in 1988. |
| Ten-cent coin | The ten-cent coin was first issued as a circular coin in 0.800 fineness silver in 1866. The coin's composition was changed to nickel in 1935, and to nickel-brass in 1948. The overall design was changed in 1982, becoming a nickel-brass coin 17.5mm in diameter. |
| Twenty-cent coin | The twenty-cent coin was first issued as a circular coin in 0.800 fineness silver in 1866. The overall design was changed in 1975, becoming a scallop-shaped nickel-brass coin. |
| Fifty-cent coin | First issued by the Hong Kong government from 1866 to 1868, the fifty-cent coin contained 90% silver and had a diameter of 32mm. During the reign of George VI, this denomination was re-introduced, struck in copper-nickel and with a reduced diameter of 23.5mm. In 1977, a nickel-brass coin with a similar design was issued, except for the further reduced diameter. |
| One-dollar coin | The dollar coin experienced three stages of change. First issued from 1866 to 1868, it was minted in 90% silver with a 38mm diameter. The coin was re-introduced in 1960, where copper-nickel coins with a diameter of 29.8mm were issued. The coin was most recently re-sized in 1978, in which the diameter was further reduced to 25.5mm. |
| Five-dollar coin | The first series of decagon shaped five-dollar coin was issued in 1976. Yet, as it was easily counterfeited during that era, the colonial government decided to change the design of the five-dollar coin to a circle-shaped design with security edge starting 1980. |

## Coins in circulation since 1993

On New Year's Day (1 January) 1993 at stroke of midnight HKT, prior to the official establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, coins with Queen Elizabeth II's portrait ended production. All new banknotes and coins in circulation feature Hong Kong's *Bauhinia* flower or other symbols. Coins with the Queen's portrait are still legal tender and are in circulation. Because the redesign was highly sensitive both politically and economically, the designing process of the new coins could not be entrusted to an artist but was undertaken by Joseph Yam, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, himself who found in the Bauhinia the requested "politically neutral design" and did a secret "scissors and paste job". On New Year's Day (1 January) 1993 at stroke of midnight HKT, The new coins were officially launched and introduced along with the new banknotes.

Hong Kong officially introduced a new series of coin on New Year's Day (1 January) 1993 at stroke of midnight HKT in denominations of 10-cent, 20-cent, 50-cent, HK$1, HK$2 and HK$10.

Since the introduction of the Octopus card in 1997, small value payments and purchases in Hong Kong are mostly made as Octopus transactions. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority did not issue any new coinage from 1998 to 2011 as the territory had stored enough for use. The increased consumption of coins in the territory since 2004 would influence the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to resume minting coins in 2012.

The obverse of newer coin bear the standard bauhinia, with the word "Hong Kong" in Chinese characters and English. The reverse features the denomination in Chinese characters and English with a large Arabic numeral in the centre and the year of issue below.
