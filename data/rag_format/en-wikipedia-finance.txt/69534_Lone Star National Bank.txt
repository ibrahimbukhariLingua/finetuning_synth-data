In 2015 the bank received a penalty for violating anti-money laundering regulations after some of the bank’s customers were identified as politically exposed persons without them having enhanced due diligence checks and at least one customer was convicted of money laundering.


## History

Lone Star National Bank opened its first location in January 1983 in Pharr, Hidalgo County with ten employees providing retail banking and commercial banking for small businesses. The bank subsequently opened more locations in the Rio Grande Valley, starting with a banking center in McAllen, Texas in 1994. In August 2000, it opened its first banking center outside of Hidalgo County in Rio Grande City, Texas. This was followed by a location opening in Brownsville, Texas in 2001. The bank's first office outside of the Rio Grande Valley was opened in Bexar County in San Antonio in early 2010 with three more centers added; one in 2011 and two in 2013.


### Legal issues

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on April 4, 2015, issued a consent decree for a $1 million civil penalty against Lone Star National Bank for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The OCC identified BSA and anti-money laundering (AML) deficiencies with Lone Star National Bank's internal controls, independent audit, suspicious activity reporting, and foreign correspondent banking program. The Bank was already under a consent order from 2012 (2012-160) which required Lone Star National Bank to undertake remedial actions with respect to its BSA/AML program.

An additional consent order (2015-029) was issued on March 31, 2015, in regards to serious deficiencies in Lone Star National Bank's lending practices. This consent order designates Lone Star National Bank as being in "troubled condition."

Lone Star National Bank is one of several banks that federal prosecutors have alleged were used by corrupt Mexican politicians and business owners to launder drug cartel money in South Texas.

In a 2013 plea hearing of a Mexican businessman who admitted to laundering money, Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie Hampton said some of the bank’s customers “have been identified as politically exposed persons, and there is nothing indicating that Lone Star National Bank conducted additional customer due diligence regarding the tracking of those millions of dollars.”
