## History

The Lindner family's rise to prominence began with Carl Lindner Sr. opening a dairy processing plant in Norwood, Ohio in 1940. The business, United Dairy Farmers, had expanded to thirty stores by 1960, and the family bought the American Financial Group with their savings. By the mid-1960s, Carl Sr.'s sons were running the family's businesses: Carl Jr. was running American Financial Group, Robert was running United Dairy Farmers, and Richard was running the Thriftway Food Drug grocery chain, which later joined with Winn-Dixie.

In 1975, Cincinnati-based American Financial Group, one of billionaire Carl Lindner, Jr.'s companies, bought into United Fruit Company. In August 1984, Lindner took control of the company and renamed it Chiquita Brands International.

In 1989, the Lindner family founded and funded the Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy.

In 1999, Carl Jr. bought controlling ownership in the Cincinnati Reds, which he held until selling to Robert Castellini in 2005.

In 2015, Carl III became majority owner and chief executive owner of the newly formed soccer club FC Cincinnati.
