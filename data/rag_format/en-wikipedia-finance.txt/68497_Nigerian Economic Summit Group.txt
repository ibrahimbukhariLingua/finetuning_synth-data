Nigerian Economic Summit Group


# Nigerian Economic Summit Group



The **Nigerian Economic Summit Group** (**NESG**) is a non-profit, non-partisan, private sector organisation with a mandate to promote and champion the reform of the Nigerian economy into a modern, globally competitive, sustainable, inclusive, open economy.


## History

In 1993, a group of private sector leaders representing key economic sectors conceived the Nigerian Economic Summit (NES) and sustained it as a platform for bringing together private sector leaders and senior public sector officials to discuss and dialogue on the future of the Nigerian Economy.

Three years later, in 1996, the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) was established and incorporated as a non-profit, non-partisan private sector organisation with a mandate to promote and champion the reform of the Nigerian economy into an open, private sector-led globally competitive economy.

In 2022, the Nigerian Economic Summit Group appointed Olaniyi Yusuf as its new chairman. Mr Yusuf, who until his appointment was the first vice chairman of the NESG, took over from Asue Ighodalo, who was appointed in 2018 following the retirement of Mr Kyari Bukar.

In 2023, the NESG announced the appointment of Dr Tayo Aduloju as the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NESG, effective from 1 January 2024. Until his appointment, Tayo Aduloju was the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Senior Fellow, Economic Policy, Strategy, and Competitiveness of the NESG.


## The Nigerian Economic Summit

The annual Nigerian Economic Summit (NES) is organised in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Budget and National Planning. The Summit is a yearly gathering of high-level public and private sector leaders in Abuja, the nation’s capital, for dialogue on Nigeria’s economic management.

It brings together chief executives and top-level decision-makers from the private sector and the highest level policymaking officials from the public sector to discuss how best to grow the economy and to monitor the progress being made. Traditionally, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN), the Vice President, Ministers and other top-level government officials participate actively at the NES.
