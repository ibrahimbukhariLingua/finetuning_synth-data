In June 2014, the company acquired its partner's 50% interest in Clay Terrace for $22.9 million.

In January 2015, the company acquired Glimcher Realty Trust in a $4.3 billion transaction and the company was renamed as WP Glimcher. As part of the transaction, Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas, were sold to Simon Property Group, while WP Glimcher acquired Brunswick Square in East Brunswick, New Jersey and Jefferson Valley Mall in Yorktown Heights, New York from Simon.

On June 20, 2016, CEO Michael P. Glimcher resigned from the company and Louis G. Conforti was named chief executive officer.
