GT Capital acquired 3.6 billion new common shares in MPIC at PHP 6.10 per share amounting to a stake of 11.4 percent on an expanded capital base for a total cash consideration of PHP 21.96 billion. It also acquired a further 1.3 billion common shares in MPIC from Metro Pacific Holdings, Inc. (MPHI), a Philippine affiliate of First Pacific Company, at the same price, for a total of PHP 7.93 billion in cash. These transactions result in GT Capital holding an overall stake of 15.6 percent of the common share capital of MPIC in a new business alliance between the two business groups.

In August 2023, the company formally filed for voluntary delisting from the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). The company completed its tender offer on September 19, 2023 acquiring 5.46 billion common shares equivalent to 19% of the company and was eventually delisted from the PSE effective October 9.

However, the size of Ang's investment was not disclosed.
