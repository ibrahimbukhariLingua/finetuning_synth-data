## History

Timothy Bray, with University of Waterloo professors Frank Tompa and Gaston Gonnet, founded OpenText Corporation in 1991. It grew out of OpenText Systems Inc., founded in 1989. The founders spun the company off from a University of Waterloo project that developed technology to index the Oxford English Dictionary.

Key people involved later include Tom Jenkins, who joined the company as COO in 1994. Tom Jenkins later became president and chief executive officer, and has been Executive Chairman since 2013. John Shackleton served as president from 1998 to 2011, and as CEO from 2005 to 2011. Mark Barrenechea has been president and CEO of OpenText since 2012. Mark Barrenechea was named Canadian Business CEO of the year in 2015. From January 2016, Steve Murphy served as the President; however, the company eliminated the position in Q1 2017.

OpenText is a supporter of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus, contributing both funds and in-kind services to the school.

In July 2020, OpenText partnered with cybersecurity company NINJIO. The collaboration strengthens security awareness with videos showcasing detection of phishing emails and inappropriate URLs.

In 2016, EMC was acquired by Dell, becoming Dell EMC. Subsequently, all of the Documentum intellectual property was sold to OpenText Corporation.


### Document Server Alchemy Edition

Rebranded product resulting from the acquisition of Captaris


### Content Suite Platform

In 1996, the product originally called "Livelink" became OpenText's. Between 2003 and 2005, "Livelink" evolved from being the name of a single product to being a brand applied to the names of several OpenText software products. As a result of this change, "Livelink Server" became known as "Livelink Enterprise Server" (LES) and later "Livelink ECM. In 2012, OpenText introduced the OpenText Content Suite. Then the technology component formerly known as Livelink ECM - Enterprise Server became known as *OpenText Content Server*, which is now a key component of OpenText Content Suite Platform.


### Archive Center (Archive Server)

First released in May 2006, Livelink Enterprise Archive (LEA) became Archive Server in 2010. It is a key product in the Extended ECM scenario. With Version 16, the Archive Server was renamed to Archive Center.

### RightFax

OpenText RightFax provides network-based fax functionality to enterprise organizations and has evolved through many versions since it was first released in 1992.


### RedDot and content authoring

RedDot, founded in 1993, was a business unit of OpenText Corporation that the company refers to as the *Web Solutions Group*. The software assists in the management of content, with regulatory compliance and industry specific requirements.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Its core product, RedDot CMS is a Windows-based server application that provides Web content management in a multi-user environment. Complementary to the CMS or as a standalone product, LiveServer aggregates disparate document resources and serves them as Web pages.

Red dots on the authoring interface indicated sections of editable content for each web page, hence the name RedDot for the product. This feature was popular with customers and won awards in 2001 for its usability. By 2006, RedDot was one of the few WCM vendors that continued to develop their own content authoring interface. Most other WCM vendors had moved to open source alternatives, or had licensed an online rich-text editor from commercial vendors such as Ephox or Ektron. In response to customer attempts to work around the limitations of the RedDot editor by installing other editors RedDot developed an integration layer to support CKeditor and Ephox EditLive! as alternative editors. In 2009, RedDot (rebranded the OpenText Web Solutions Group) made the Telerik RadEditor available alongside the existing RedDot editor for CMS 9.

After the acquisition of Vignette, Web Solutions was rebranded again to become OpenText Web Site Management.


### Intelligent Capture (formerly Captiva)

Captiva Software became a subsidiary of OpenText in 2017. It makes software for document information processing and data capture from paper and electronic documents and provides related services. Information in the form of extracted content and files are acquired in the Captiva Solution and then delivered for storage or workflow into document management systems such as those from Documentum, OpenText, Microsoft, or IBM. In 2019, Captiva was rebranded as OpenText Intelligent Capture.


### AppEnhancer (formerly ApplicationXtender)

AppEnhancer is a content management system that manages, organizes, and stores information from an application or as an extension to an existing application. The product was acquired during OpenText's purchase of Dell EMC's ECD (Enterprise Content Division) in 2017.
