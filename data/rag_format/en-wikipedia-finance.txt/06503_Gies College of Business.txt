## History

The university senate approved the College of Commerce and Business Administration on June 9, 1914 at the request of David Kinley, a university vice president who would later serve as president of the University of Illinois. The college was officially formed on April 27, 1915, through a vote of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. The college began with three departments: Economics, Business Organization and Operation, and Transportation.

Since 2015, the college has partnered with Coursera to offer online MBA (iMBA) program, with additional options for online graduate certificates, an online MSM (iMSM), and an online MSA (iMSA). The school started with 113 students in the beginning for the online programs and later grew to more than 3,200 degree-seeking students from 46 states in United States and more than 90 countries in the world. The selectivity and acceptance rate to the program initially was 20.9% and is currently at 53%.

In 2017, alumni Larry and Beth Gies donated US$150M to the school, which was renamed the Gies College of Business in their honor. In 2020, alumnus Don Edwards donated US$10 million and the business school also further received a pledge in 2020 for $2.5 million for construction of shared instructional facility.

In 2019, the school announced that it was suspending its on-campus full-time MBA, part-time MBA, and executive MBA.


## Campus

Gies College of Business is located in Champaign, Illinois. The campus is located around the intersection of Gregory Street and Sixth Street. When the college was first formed, however, it occupied the Commerce Building, now the East half of the Administration Building on the Main Quad.

The college currently occupies three buildings: Wohlers Hall, Business Instructional Facility (BIF), and the Irwin Doctoral Study Hall. This area is known as the Business Quad and is considered part of the South Campus.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Wohlers Hall, formerly known as Commerce West, was built in 1963. Albert H. and Jane Wohlers provided a $6 million naming gift in 2000 for renovations.

The Business Instructional Facility (commonly referred to as "BIF"), approved by the UI Board of Trustees on July 14, 2004, stands opposite of Wohlers Hall across Sixth Street. The $62 million project, designed by architect Cesar Pelli, is LEED-certified because of its "green", environmentally friendly elements.


## Academic departments

Gies College of Business houses three departments: Accountancy, Business Administration, and Finance.


### Accountancy

The Department of Accountancy was founded in 1953.

The University offered courses in accounting before the creation of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Business. The courses in the university were offered through the Department of Economics from 1902 to 1915. The college began the first PhD program in 1937 and has graduated more accountancy PhD candidates than any other accountancy department in the United States. After the formation of the college, the accountancy program was moved into the Department of Business Organization until the Department's reorganization in the 1950s.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1919, H.T. Scovill helped establish the Beta Alpha Psi accounting honor society.


### Business Administration

The Department of Business Administration was founded in 1968 through the mergers of the Department of Industrial Administration and Marketing and the Graduate School of Business Administration. The department offers an iMBA program in collaboration with Coursera. Also the Gies College of Business continues to innovate with the launch of its new online MBA program, which has been ranked among the top in the nation

Each iMBA course has self-directed, asynchronous pre-recorded video courses through Coursera, complementary readings, and a high engagement virtual classroom environment. The virtual classes are weekly live sessions with faculty and your classmates. Classes typically have individual assignments, group assignments, and may include midterm and final exams.

Degree programs are flexible with completion time ranging from 24-60 months. Courses are 4-8 weeks long and students may register for 1-4 courses per 16 week semester; if approved, students can take additional courses each semester and complete the iMBA in as little as 15 months.

Students can select from 5 focus areas and 18+ electives. Core specializations include Strategic Leadership and Management, Managerial Economics and Business Analysis, Value Chain Management, and Financial Management. Focus area specializations include Digital Marketing, Entrepreneurship and Strategic Innovation, Global Challenges in Business, Business Analytics, and Mergers and Acquisitions.
