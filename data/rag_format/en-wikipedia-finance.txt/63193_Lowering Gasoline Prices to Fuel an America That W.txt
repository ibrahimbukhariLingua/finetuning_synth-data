Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014


# Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014



The **Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014** (H.R.Â 4899) is a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.

The bill was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.


## Background

The administration of President Barack Obama delayed the sale of some oil and natural gas sales off the coasts of Virginia and South Carolina. This bill would require those sales to go forward.

Louisiana and other states along the Gulf of Mexico will receive 37.5 percent of the off-shore royalty payments paid to the federal government for off-shore leases in that area beginning in 2017. The maximum royalty payout is currently $500 million, but would be increased to $1 billion in 2024 by this bill.

## Congressional Budget Office report

*This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source.*

Title I would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. Title I is similar to H.R. 2231, the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2013. Differences in the estimates primarily reflect a later assumed enactment date.

Title II would make certain amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act, require the United States Secretary of the Interior to conduct new activities related to oil and gas development on federal lands, and authorize the Secretary to conduct auctions for federal onshore oil and gas leases using Internet-based bidding methods. Title II contains provisions that are similar to those in H.R. 1965, the Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on November 20, 2013, H.R. 1394; the Planning for American Energy Act of 2013, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013; H.R. 1964, the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Access Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on June 12, 2013; and H.R. 555, the BLM Live Internet Auctions Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 24, 2013. Differences in the estimates primarily reflect a later assumed enactment date.


## Procedural history

The Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 19, 2014 by Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. The House voted in Roll Call Vote 368 on June 26, 2014 to pass the bill 229-185.


## Debate and discussion

Rep. Hastings, who introduced the bill, argued that "the current turmoil in Iraq has already caused the price of gasoline to increase, and it serves as an important reminder of why we need to increase production here at home" because it is the "best way to protect ourselves from price spikes caused by international conflicts." Hastings blamed President Obama for the high gas prices, saying that "since President Obama took office, gasoline prices have doubled and our federal energy resources have been put under tight lock-and-key." Hastings also argued that the bill would "create over 1 million new American jobs."

Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) supported the bill, arguing that the bill "would allow us to take advantage of our natural resources and expands our energy manufacturing and construction industries."

Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) opposed the bill, arguing that it did not solve the true cause of high gas prices which he blamed on "Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street." DeFazio called the bill the "drill everywhere" bill.
