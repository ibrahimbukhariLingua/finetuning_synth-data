## Early life and career

Born to a Sephardic Jewish family in Istanbul, Turkey, on 1 October 1953, Andic's family emigrated from Turkey to Barcelona, Spain in 1969 where he and his brother Nahman began selling hand-embroidered "made-in-Turkey" T-shirts and clogs. They opened shops in Barcelona and Madrid, first selling their own brand (Isak Jeans) and then stocking other brands. In 1984, he joined with fellow entrepreneur Enric Cusí and his brother and re-denominated all their stores under the name Mango. Andic chose the name "Mango" after tasting the fruit on a trip to the Philippines.

In 2006, Andic was appointed a director of Banco Sabadell and in 2012, became its single largest shareholder with a 7% ownership interest.

According to Forbes, Andic's net worth as of November 2023 was €2.7 billion, making him the richest person in Catalonia. In 2010, he was the 32nd richest Jew in the world.

On 14 December 2024, Andic died in a spelunking accident in the Salnitre de Collbató caves in the Montserrat mountains near Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Although the Spanish newspapers gave conflicting reports over whether he fell off a cliff or fell down a ravine, Andic's death was confirmed by Pedro Sanchez, the Prime Minister of Spain. Police were reportedly called to the scene after Andic slipped and fell 150 meters to his death. A helicopter, ambulance and a specialized mountain unit were also reportedly called to the scene. One Spanish newspaper described the area in which Andic fell an "area of difficult access". Members of Andic's family, including his son, were with him at the time of the accident. Mango CEO Toni Ruiz said of Andic's death on social media, "His departure leaves a huge void but all of us are, in some way, his legacy and the testimony of his achievements." Catalan president Salvador Illa Roca said Andic "contributed to making Catalonia great and projecting it to the world."

As Mango's largest shareholder, Andic was worth an estimated US$4.5 billion at the time of his death, making him the richest person in Catalonia and one of the richest in Spain.

A spokesperson for the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain gave Andic credit for "great advances for Spanish Judaism", and called him an "an active pillar of the Jewish community in Barcelona and Spain."
