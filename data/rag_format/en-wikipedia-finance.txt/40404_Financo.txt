## About


### History

Financo was founded in 1971 by Wharton School graduate Gilbert Harrison, who has previously worked with American Eagle, BCBG Max Azria, and Bear Stearns Merchant Banking. It completed over 140 deals in its first fourteen years. In 1985, the firm was acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers (at the time owned by American Express) and became the Lehman Brothers Middle Market Group, still headed by Gilbert Harrison. In 1989, Harrison reacquired the Financo name and re-established the firm independent of Shearson Lehman. In 2020, the firm was acquired by Raymond James Financial for an undisclosed sum. The firm continued to operate under the Financo name within Raymond James.

Financo has regularly hosted a discussion panel during the National Retail Federation Convention about topics related to the retail and fashion industries. Their 2011 Annual CEO Panel was hosted by CNBC's Nicole Lapin. Panelists included Dan Schock (Google), Ben Fischman (Rue La La), Chip Wilson (lululemon), and Stephen Zangre (Facebook).


### Structure

The company has two divisions. The first division is investment banking, which has three departments specializing in Mergers & Acquisitions, Financo Securities, and Special Situations. The second division, Financo Global Consulting (FGC), provides business consulting services. Some consultants have previously been employed as Chairman of Neiman Marcus, Chairman and CEO of Macy's East, Chairman and CEO of Sears, and CEO of Anne Klein.
