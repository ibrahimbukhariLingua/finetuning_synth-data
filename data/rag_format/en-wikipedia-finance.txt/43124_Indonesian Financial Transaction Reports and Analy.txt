# Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center



The **Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center** or INTRAC (Indonesian: *Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan*) or *PPATK* is a government agency of Indonesia responsible for financial intelligence. The agency was formed in 2002 to prevent and eradicate suspected illicit financial flows as money laundering and provide information on terrorist financing.


## History

In 1997, Indonesia officially signed and ratified United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. As one of signatory countries, Indonesia obliged to consider money laundering as criminal act and required to have measure to identify, trace, or confiscate money in relation to illicit traffic in narcotics drugs. At the same year, Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering is also founded, which Indonesia officially joined in 2000.

The second Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report published in June 2001 and including a supplemental report in September, denoted Indonesia as one of non-cooperative countries. As response, Bank Indonesia issued Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 3/10/PBI/2001 on Know your customer principle, which requires financial institution to identify its customer and its transactional profile, and trace money source. And refer to this regulation, financial transaction reports and analysis is officially conducted by special investigation unit of Bank Indonesia.

On the next year, Law No. 15 Year 2002 regarding money laundering issued to further strengthen effort on combatting money laundering and PPATK was officially formed. Since 2010, PPATK is regulated by Law No. 8 Year 2010. PPATK's mandate was expanded in 2013 to provide information regarding terrorist financing by Law No. 9 Year 2013.
