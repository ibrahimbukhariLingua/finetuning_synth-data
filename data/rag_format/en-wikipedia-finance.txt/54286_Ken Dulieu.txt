## Capcon Holdings plc

He acted as chief executive until the sale of the business to Carlisle Holdings plc in 1998. At point of sale, Capitol Group plc was one of the largest suppliers of security and investigatory services, and counter terrorism in the United Kingdom, with over 3,000 employees.

In 1998, together with others, Dulieu re-purchased the Investigations Division and Audit & Stocktaking business from Carlisle Holdings plc, which was floated on AIMᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ in 2001 as Capcon Holdings plc.

Upon invitation, from 2002 to 2010, he acted as Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Remuneration and Nominations Committees of previously Alternative Investment Market listed Vantis plc, an accountancy and financial services business.


## Southampton Football Club

In 2006, Dulieu was appointed chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings plc, the publicly listed holdings company of Southampton Football Club. He led a new executive team to effect the financial turnaround and restructure of the club, which was haemorrhaging cash and near the bottom of the English Football League. Within a year, the club was challenging for promotion, losses were reduced from £3.3m to less than £1m and debt was substantially reduced. Dulieu stepped down as chairman in 2007 having completed an extended term to find new investment in the club. He was replaced by Leon Crouch as acting chairman.


## Coventry City Football Club

In 2010, Dulieu was appointed chairman of Coventry City Football Club, tasked with devising and implementing a turnaround strategy for the club. Within a year, significant improvements were introduced, including a substantial reduction in losses, the integration of the academy and first team, player contract extensions with flexible terms and an increase in the value of the squad. In December 2011, Dulieu stepped down as chairman, having prepared the club for the implementation of the UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations.
