## History

On November 5, 2014, security firms Accuvant and FishNet Security announced that they would join forces to create a new company. The merger would create a roughly $1.5 billion information security giant with solutions covering nearly every aspect of cyber defense.

The merger was completed on February 2, 2015, when the company announced that the previously announced transaction had closed. The new company was owned primarily by the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that acquired a majority stake in Accuvant in March 2014.

On April 21, 2015, Accuvant and FishNet Security announced plans to launch their new, combined corporate name and brand, and to begin conducting business as Optiv Security in the summer of 2015. The new Optiv brand was officially launched at the Black Hat USA conference in August 2015.

In 2016, Optiv acquired Advancive, Adaptive Communications, and substantially all assets of Evantix. That year, Optiv also made senior executive hires including a new CIO and Country General Manager for Canada.

In November 2016, Optiv filed to become a publicly-traded company. However, on February 1, 2017, Optiv announced that it had been acquired by the global investment firm KKR. In 2017, Optiv also expanded operations globally in Canada – including the acquisition of Conexsys, a Toronto-based security solutions provider. Optiv has since continued its growth in Canada and was named a “Major Player” in the Canadian Security Services 2018 Vendor Assessment from IDC MarketScape.

In March 2017, the company announced it was acquiring Comm Solutions, a Pennsylvania-based cybersecurity firm.

Optiv appointed Dave DeWalt and General (Ret.) David Petraeus to its board of directors in September 2017.

In mid-2018, Optiv moved its headquarters into the newly constructed 40-story 1144 Fifteenth Tower in downtown Denver and is considered a primary tenant of the building.

In July 2019, Optiv announced the opening of its Dallas Innovation and Fusion Center, an approximately 14,000 square-foot facility located in Frisco, Texas. This facility features an Advanced Fusion Center (AFC), an evolution of the security operations center (SOC) model. The AFC combines global cybersecurity experts with data analytics, robotics, machine learning, intelligence and automation capabilities.

In April 2022, Optiv began offering a Privileged Access Management as-a-Service (PMaaS). In August 2022, Optiv began working with Shared Services Canada, a Canadian government information technology agency.

Optiv acquired ClearShark, a reseller of cybersecurity to the federal government, in March 2023.
