## Chief executive/director


### Debenhams

In 1985, she left Harrods to become a menswear merchandiser at Debenhams. She rose to become a company director in 1991. She was appointed trading director and joined the board in 1997.

During her administration the company did well despite an unfavourable economic climate. She became the first chief executive of a London Stock Exchange-listed company to take maternity leave with the birth of her second son in 2001. Her planned six weeks' absence made headlines of some national newspapers as a relatively long time for a chief executive to take off work.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ She was re-elected at annual general meetings up to and including 2003.

She left Debenhams in 2003. Her failure that October to secure a buyout of Debenhams by Permira prompted her departure (Debenhams was eventually bought for £1.7 billion by a rival private consortium).
