The **Network of Tax Organisations (NTO)**, is a non-profit intergovernmental organisation, which provides a forum to assist Regional Tax Organizations to improve their functionality. The NTO Secretariat is located in Bonn, Germany.


## Factsheet

The Network of Tax Organisations (NTO) is a network of regional and international tax organisations that aims to develop a global platform to strengthen tax systems around the world and improve coordination between member countries.
The NTO was founded in May 2018 in Ottawa, Canada, and brings together 10 member organisations that represent over 180 national tax administrations worldwide. Jointly, NTO aims to develop the capacity of NTO members and foster international collaboration and dialogue on tax in support of effective Domestic Revenue Mobilisation (DRM).


## Activities and Publications

In August 2024, a comprehensive Data Governance course, including translations of the "Data Governance for Tax Administrations: A Practical Guide" manual into French and Spanish, and three online events were held by the NTO to further knowledge through practical case studies and real-time exchanges with international experts.


## Structure and funding

NTO membership is voluntary. The main governing bodies of the NTO are the NTO Assembly, the NTO Council, the Head of Council, the Focal Points, the Working Groups, and the NTO Secretariat. The NTO Secretariat is facilitated by the International Tax Compact (ITC) which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and co-funded by the European Union. The ITC is implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH.
