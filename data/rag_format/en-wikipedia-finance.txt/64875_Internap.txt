On March 16, 2020, Internap Technology Solutions, Inc. and six affiliated companies filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The company emerged from bankruptcy on May 11, 2020.

Less than a month after emerging from bankruptcy, on June 2, INAP announced that it sold its colocation business located at 1301 Fannin St, Houston TX, to Netrality.

On September 28, 2022, INAPs product "ServerIntellect" was the target of a ransomware attack that affected their multitenant website, database, and email hosting services causing data loss for those services. As a result, INAP discontinued multitenant hosting services. INAP removed the original ransomware incident report from their "Operational Transparency" page on October 5, 2022.
