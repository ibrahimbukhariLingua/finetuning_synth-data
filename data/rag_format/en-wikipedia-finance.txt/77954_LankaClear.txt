## CCAPS

Launched under the brand name **LankaPay** in July 2013, the Common Card and Payment Switch (CCAPS) is the first phase of creating a more robust, efficient, and secure payment infrastructure for Sri Lanka. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has since approved the CCAPS as Sri Lanka's "National Payment Switch".

CCAPS can be further divided into the following areas:

* LankaPay Common ATM Switch (CAS)
* LankaPay Shared ATM Switch (SAS)
* LankaPay National Card Scheme (NCS)
* LankaPay Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS)
* LankaPay Common POS Switch (CPS)
* Common Mobile Switch (CMobS)

As per the *Payments and Settlements Systems Circular No. 7 of 2015* issued by the Central Bank dated 30 November 2015, all licensed banks in Sri Lanka should join the CAS, CEFTS, CPS, and CMobS networks by 31 March 2016, 30 September 2016, 31 December 2016, and 30 September 2017, respectively.


### Common ATM Switch

The Common ATM Switch (or CAS in short), is an interbank ATM network that allows participating banks to use each other's ATMs for free or at a minimal charge. The system was launched in July 2013 with BOC and People's Bank, with the first transaction carried out by the former governor of the Central Bank Ajith Nivard Cabraal, and deputy governor Ananda Silva. The aim of CAS is to create a single unified ATM network in Sri Lanka.

As at March 2016, twelve banks have joined the LankaPay CAS network, expanding the countrywide member ATMs to over 3,000 and making LankaPay the largest ATM network in the country. Member banks include BOC, Cargills Bank, Commercial Bank, HNB, Habib Bank, National Savings Bank, Nations Trust Bank, NDB, People's Bank, Regional Development Bank, Sampath Bank, Seylan Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Union Bank.


### Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch

The Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (or CEFTS) for short is a fully automated paperless fund transfer system which allows instantaneous fund transfers between member banks.
