## History

SecondMarket was founded in 2004 by Barry Silbert to provide liquidity for restricted securities in public companies. Beginning in early 2008, SecondMarket expanded into other asset classes—first auction‐rate securities, then bankruptcy claims, limited partnership interests, structured products (MBS, CDO, ABS), whole loans, private company stock, government IOUs and bitcoins.

In 2007, the company raised an undisclosed amount of Series A financing from venture capital firm Pequot Ventures. In February 2010, the company raised US$15 million in Series B funding to aid its expansion into Asia. In November 2011, the company announced that they had closed a US$15 million Series C round, led by The Social+Capital Partnership. The last round of investment valued SecondMarket at US$200 million, up from a valuation of about US$150 million set in the previous round in February 2010.

The World Economic Forum listed the company as a Technology Pioneer for 2011.

The firm's private-company transactions totaled $100 million in 2009, and $400 million in 2010. SecondMarket takes fees from 3 to 5 percent on each trade (split evenly between buyer and seller). In March 2011, it had 53,000 registered participants, up from 35,000 in 2010, 6,500 in 2009 and 2,500 in 2008.

In 2015, NASDAQ acquired Second Market Solutions, which was a competitor to NASDAQ's Private Market initiative. NASDAQ rebranded Second Market Solutions as NASDAQ Private Market.
