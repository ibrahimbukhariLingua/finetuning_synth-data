Data driven marketing


# Data driven marketing



**Data-driven marketing** is a process by which marketers use analytics tools to gain insights into customer or consumer behavior, including purchasing patterns, advert effectiveness, and browsing habits. Contemporary methods utilize big data strategies to collect and analyze information on interactions and engagements at scale, aiming to predict future behaviors.

This analysis involves evaluating historical data, conducting experiements with new data, and systematically organizing and interpreting the results to iterate and improve marketing strategies.

The primary objective of data-driven marketing is to better understand and address customer needs by deductive reasoning. Market research provides a detailed understanding of consumer preferences.


## History

Contemporary data driven marketing can be traced back to the 1980s and the emergence of database marketing, which increased the ease of personalizing customer communications.


## In practice

Through the use of analytic tools, marketers attempt to understand customer behavior and make informed decisions based on the data.

E-commerce retailers use data driven marketing to try and improve customer experience and increase sales. One example cited in the *Harvard Business Review* is Vineyard Vines, a fashion brand with brick-and-mortar stores and an online product catalog. The company has used an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to gain knowledge about its customers from actions taken or not taken on the e-commerce site. Email or social media communications are automatically triggered at certain points, such as cart abandonment. This information is also used to refine search engine marketing.
