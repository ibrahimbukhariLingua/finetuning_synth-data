State Planning Organization (Turkey)


# State Planning Organization (Turkey)



**State Planning Organization** (Turkish: *Devlet Planlama Teşkilatı*, DPT) was established on September 30, 1960, National Unity Committee's initiatives following the 1960 Turkish coup d'état. Unlike the previous administration, which limited state planning primarily to agriculture, this new body was tasked with advising the government on setting economic, social, and cultural objectives, as well as formulating five-year plans in alignment with these objectives.

As one of Turkey's key governmental agencies, it played a pivotal role in shaping state policy. However, with the gradual liberalization of Turkey's economic policies, the organization's influence waned. In June 2011, it was absorbed into the newly formed Ministry of Development, reflecting shifts in the country's planning and development strategies.
