## History

After the end of the Cambodian civil war in 1998, there was an urgent need to build business skills to develop the Cambodian economy. CamEd was established soon after in the year 2000 as a professional training organization for international companies and organizations. In 2003 CamEd began teaching for the international ACCA accounting qualifications. This coincided with the passage of a new law on accounting that was issued in the year 2003 which required professional licensure for accounting and auditing services. In 2010, CamEd was accredited as an institute of higher education with degree granting powers. In the same year, CamEd received a gold quality rating, the highest level of quality approval from the international ACCA. CamEd remains the only institute or university in Cambodia with quality recognition from the ACCA.

Within the higher education regulatory framework of Cambodia, CamEd is an “institute”. In Cambodia, regulations require “universities” to offer degrees in a broad range of subjects and majors across multiple colleges or faculties. In contrast, “institutes” are allowed to offer degrees of higher education in a narrower range of subjects. CamEd is an institute which specializes in teaching accounting and finance.
Based in Phnom Penh, and is Cambodia's leading institute of higher education in the fields of accounting and finance. More than 50% of the annual recruits of the big four audit firms in Cambodia (PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, and EY) are students or graduates of CamEd.
