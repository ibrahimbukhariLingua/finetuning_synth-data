## History

Banyan Tree started when founder Ho Kwon Ping and his wife Claire Chiang came across a plot of land while they were on holiday in Bang Tao Bay, on the western coast of Phuket in the Andaman Sea. They purchased the land and embarked on a regeneration programme, reintroducing indigenous plants. Ten years later, in 1994, the first resort, Banyan Tree Phuket, was built.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2009, Banyan Tree Global Foundation was created as part of Banyan Group Limited. In December 2016, Banyan Tree entered into a partnership with a French hospitality company, Accor. As part of the deal, Accor would invest €16 million to Banyan Tree in exchange for a 5% stake in the company, with the option to purchase an additional 5% stake.

In May 2019, Banyan Tree announced its first resort in Singapore on a 4.6 hectares (11 acres) site in Mandai, which is scheduled to open in the first half of 2025 and will be located near the Mandai Wildlife Parks.
