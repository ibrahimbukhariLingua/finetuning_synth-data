Electricity Authority (Israel)


# Electricity Authority (Israel)



The **Israel Public Utility Authority for Electricity** is a government authority charged with providing utility services, setting tariffs, regulation, and oversight of the electricity market in Israel. Established in 1996, the Authority came into existence concurrently with the expiration of the 70-year-old concession of the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), and pursuant to the Electricity Market Law of 1996. Its formation marked a significant shift in the regulation and oversight of electricity provision in Israel, transitioning from a system where the Electric Corporation itself managed various regulatory roles to an independent regulatory body.

The Authority's primary responsibilities include the regulation and oversight of public utilities in the electricity sector, ensuring a balance of interests between consumers, the Electric Corporation, private electricity manufacturers, and the state. It plays a crucial role in setting electricity tariffs, promoting renewable energy, and encouraging private power production. The Electricity Authority operates under the guidelines established by the Electricity Market Law, which defines its powers, tasks, composition, and manner of operation.

In addition to setting tariffs, the Authority is responsible for establishing standards for the quality and nature of services provided by various entities in the electricity market, overseeing cost monitoring for the Electric Corporation, and issuing licenses to operate within the market. The Authority also sets economic arrangements for license holders and private entrepreneurs, promoting competition and streamlining consumption in the electricity market.


## History

The Authority was established in 1996, concurrent with the expiration of the 70-year-old concession of the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC), and pursuant to the Electricity Market Law of 1996. Prior to the establishment of the Electricity Authority, the Electric Corporation itself operated vis-a-vis the government of Israel in various fields related to regulation of the electricity system in Israel, such as the initiation of the construction of new power plants.
The powers and tasks of the Authority, as well as the composition of the Authority's members and its manner of operation are defined in and based on the Electricity Market Law. The Electricity Authority serves as an independent professional regulator in matters concerning the electricity market in Israel, and is responsible for the regulation and oversight of the provision of public utilities in the field of electricity in Israel. The Authority is obligated to maintain a balance of interests between consumers, the Electric Corporation, electricity manufacturers, and the state.
Part of the role of the Electricity Authority is the setting of the electricity tariffs in Israel, and the implementation of Israeli government decisions which have set a required level of power production by private producers and by renewable energy, through the encouragement and regulation of private power producers and producers of electricity from renewable energies, alongside the Electric Corporation.
