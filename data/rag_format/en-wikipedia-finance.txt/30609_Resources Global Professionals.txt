## History

Resources Connection, Inc. was founded in June 1996 by a team at Deloitte, led by Donald B. Murray, who was then a senior partner with Deloitte. The company operated as a part of Deloitte from June 1996 until April 1999 when a management-led buyout was completed in partnership with several investors. In December 2000, the company completed an initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Hoover's recognized the IPO as one of the ten best performing of that quarter. The company now trades as one of the members of the NASDAQ Global Select index.

In January 2005, the company changed its operating entity name to Resources Global Professionals to better reflect the company's multinational capabilities.
The company operated solely in the United States until 2000, when it opened its first three international offices and began to expand geographically.

In December 2012, the company shortened Resources Global Professionals to RGP, and announced new sub-brands RGP Healthcare and RGP Legal.

In June 2013, Donald B. Murray relinquished his position as the company's Chief Executive Officer, and Anthony Cherbak succeeded him as the company's new chief executive officer. Murray remained in his role as Executive Chairman.

In July 2015, the company announced Donald B. Murray will retire from his role as Executive Chairman at the end of August 2015, and remain chairman of the board.

In December 2016, the company announced the promotion of Kate Duchene to president and chief executive officer, effective December 19, 2016. Ms. Duchene had served as the company's Interim CEO since October 5, 2016, when Anthony Cherbak announced his unexpected retirement as CEO due to health considerations.
