In mechanism design, a branch of economics, a **weakly-budget-balanced (WBB) mechanism** is a mechanism in which the total payment made by the participants is at least 0. This means that the mechanism operator does not incur a deficit, i.e., does not have to subsidize the market. Weak budget balance is considered a necessary requirement for the economic feasibility of a mechanism. A **strongly-budget-balanced (SBB) mechanism** is a mechanism in which the total payment made by the participants is *exactly* 0. This means that all payments are made among the participants - the mechanism has neither a deficit nor a surplus. The term **budget-balanced mechanism** is sometimes used as a shorthand for WBB, and sometimes as a shorthand for SBB.


## Weak budget balance

A simple example of a WBB mechanism is the Vickrey auction, in which the operator wants to sell an object to one of *n* potential buyers. Each potential buyer bids a value, the highest bidder wins an object and pays the second-highest bid. As all bids are positive, the total payment is trivially positive too.

As an example of a non-WBB mechanism, consider its extension to a bilateral trade setting. Here, there is a buyer and a seller; the buyer has a value of *b* and the seller has a cost of *s*. Trade should occur if and only if *b* > *s*. The only truthful mechanism that implements this solution must charge a trading buyer the cost *s* and pay a trading seller the value *b*; but since *b* > *s*, this mechanism runs a deficit. In fact, the Myerson–Satterthwaite theorem says that *every* Pareto-efficient truthful mechanism must incur a deficit.

McAfee developed a solution to this problem for a large market (with many potential buyers and sellers): McAfee's mechanism is WBB, truthful and almost Pareto-efficient - it performs all efficient deals except at most one. McAfee's mechanism has been extended to various settings, while keeping its WBB property. See double auction for more details.


## Strong budget balance

In a strongly-budget-balanced (SBB) mechanism, all payments are made between the participants themselves. An advantage of SBB is that all the gain from trade remains in the market; thus, the long-term welfare of the traders is larger and their tendency to participate may be higher.

McAfee's double-auction mechanism is WBB but not SBB - it may have a surplus, and this surplus may account for almost all the gain from trade. There is a simple SBB mechanism for bilateral trading: trade occurs iff *b* > *s*, and in this case the buyer pays (*b*+*s*)/2 to the seller. Since the payment goes directly from the buyer to the seller, the mechanism is SBB; however, it is not truthful, since the buyer can gain by bidding *b'* < *b* and the seller can gain by bidding *s'* > *s*. Recently, some truthful SBB mechanisms for double auction have been developed. Some of them have been generalized to multi-sided markets.
