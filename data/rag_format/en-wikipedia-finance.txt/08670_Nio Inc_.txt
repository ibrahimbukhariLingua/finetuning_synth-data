# Nio Inc.



**Nio Inc.** (Chinese: 蔚来; pinyin: *Wèilái*; stylized as **NIO**) is a Chinese electric vehicle company headquartered in Shanghai. The company was established in 2014 and adopted its current name in 2016.

In 2018, Nio filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Nio collaborates with the government-licensed vehicle manufacturer JAC Group to operate two manufacturing plants in Hefei, Anhui, China.

The company is notable for operating battery-swapping stations for its vehicles, as an alternative to conventional charging stations. It operates over 1,300 battery swap stations in China. It also develops semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicle technologies. Nio has participated in Formula E racing since 2014. Nio created a new electric car brand called Onvo in 2024, intending to target the mass market.


## Overview

After the brand launch on November 21, 2016 in the Saatchi Gallery in London, England, several companies invested in Nio, including Tencent, Temasek, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. Its first model, the Nio EP9 sports car, debuted the same day.

In October 2016, Nio announced that it had been given an "Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit" by the California DMV and it would begin testing on public roads under the "Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program" guidelines as part of its autonomous vehicle program. According to the company, it planned to launch vehicles with level-three and level-four autonomy.

In May 2018, Nio opened its first battery swap station in the Nanshan district, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China, dubbed the "Power Swap Station". Only batteries for ES8 cars would be available from this station.

In September 2018, the company filed for a US$1.8 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.

By 2020, Nio was on the brink of bankruptcy and its share price had fallen 62% since its IPO.¹⁰¹ The city government of Hefei obtained a 25% stake in Nio.¹⁰¹ In late April 2020, Nio announced approximately US$1 billion in new funding from a group of Chinese investors, which was needed due to the company's struggles to sell its vehicles. As part of the deal, Nio would transfer assets to a new subsidiary called Nio China, which will be headquartered in Hefei. Hefei's government also helped Nio to obtain loans from six local banks to help it develop its supply chain for batteries, engines, and control systems.¹⁰¹ Over the next year, the company's car production increased by 81% and the company's valuation reached US$100 billion.¹⁰¹

In August 2020, Nio launched Battery as a Service (BaaS) and formed a battery asset management company in collaboration with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL), Hubei Science Technology Investment Group Co., Ltd. and a subsidiary of Guotai Junan International Holdings Limited, with each contributing roughly US$31.6 million (CN¥200 million) into the venture, for 25% equity each. BaaS helps lower the purchase price of Nio electric vehicles by about 25%.

In May 2021, Nio announced an expansion plan, saying it would begin delivering cars to Norway by September 2021. In the third quarter of 2021, Nio delivered 24,439 ES8, ES6, and EC6 vehicles, a new quarterly record representing a growth of 100% year over year. In 2021, the company announced plans to expand to 25 different countries and regions by 2025.

In August 2023, Nio Capital led the A-round financing of Mavel, a provider of electric drive solutions. Nio announced in the same month that they were selected to provide electric cars for Oslo-based taxis in Norway.

On 14 December 2023, Nio founder, chairman and CEO William Li stated that in order to cope with competition, Nio would create a new brand and described its product roadmap. This new brand would be focused on the family market. The brand is expected to have only three models in its entire life cycle. This brand will also help Nio enter the 200,000 yuan ("25,000 euros") market.

In December 2023, Nio obtained the production qualification for automobiles and announced the acquisition of JAC factories that manufacture Nio vehicles, at the price of 3.2 billion yuan, which marks the end of JAC's OEM business for Nio.

### Onvo brand

In May 2024, Nio introduced a new brand, Onvo (Chinese: 乐道; pinyin: *Lèdào*) that targets the mass-market segment. Onvo was developed under the internal codename "Alps", until the name was officially confirmed in March 2024. Onvo stands for "On Voyage", while its Chinese name 乐道; *Lèdào* is meant to evoke a family having a happy time together. The brand is led by Alan Ai (Ai Tiecheng), a senior vice president of Nio.

Its first product is the Onvo L60, which will be delivered starting September 2024. The L60 directly targets the Tesla Model Y as its main competitor, with Ai making direct comparison during the L60 launch. Nio CEO William Li expects to sell Onvo cars in export markets.


### Firefly brand

In December 2024, Nio announced its new brand called Firefly (Chinese: 萤火虫; pinyin: *Yínghuǒchóng*), which was derived from its internal codename "Firefly". It will be Nio's electric small car brand. The brand's first model will be launched in Europe early in the first half of 2025. The car has been described by Nio as a rival product to models sold by Mercedes’ Smart and BMW’s Mini small car brands.


## Battery swapping

Nio's battery swap stations allow owners to upgrade the capacity of their battery packs, either temporarily or permanently. These battery swapping stations have a reported swapping time of under five minutes. Unlike Tesla, which has tried battery swapping but has never deployed it on a large scale and relies instead on its Supercharger network, Nio has built a functioning network of 1,305 battery-swap stations that covers several thousand kilometres of Chinese expressways.

The first phase of its battery swap network was installing 18 battery-swap stations in 14 different locations along the G4 expressway, a 2,273-kilometre-long (1,412 mi) road connecting Beijing (the national capital) with the Pearl River Delta (world's largest urban area where Hong Kong and Shenzhen are located). This was completed in November 2018. The second phase consisted of installing battery-swap stations in 8 locations along the G2 expressway, a 1,212-kilometre-long (753 mi) road connecting Beijing with Shanghai. This phase was completed in January 2019.

On 24 March 2021, Nio completed its 2 millionth battery swap in the city of Suzhou. It has also deployed 193 battery swapping stations, 134 supercharging stations, and 327 destination stations across China. On 10 December 2021, Nio installed its 700th battery swap station in China, hitting its annual target ahead of schedule. Nio's second-generation battery swap station allows the vehicle to automatically park into the station, with which users can experience a three-minute battery swap while staying inside the vehicle. At that point, Nio has provided over 5.3 million swaps to users in China. As of May 2022, Nio has opened its first swap station in Europe, located in Norway, with plans to expand in other cities. As of 31 December 2022, Nio has built 1,305 battery swap stations over all provincial administrative regions in China. They were providing an average of 40,000 daily battery swap services, and have completed a total of 15 million battery swap services. In August 2023, seven swap stations were operating in Germany.

In November 2023, Nio and Changan Automobile signed a strategic agreement on battery swapping. On 29 November 2023, Nio and Geely Holding signed similar agreement in the battery swapping sector, as well as with JAC Group and Chery Automobile in January 2024. These agreements including carrying out cooperation on battery standards, battery swapping technology, battery swapping network expansion and operation, swappable model development, battery asset management, and develop swappable vehicles.

In March 2024, the company opened a new battery swap station, which supports battery swap and energy storage, into operation at the Zhijiang West service area along the G50 Shanghai-Chongqing highway. This is part of an effort to build the same system for motorway service areas to connect battery swap stations to the grid as in urban areas. Also in March, Nio Power signed an agreement with Zhongan Energy of Anhui Province on battery standards, charging and battery replacement technology, and the construction and operation of battery charging and replacement networks.


### Battery specifications

To allow for easy swapping and maximizing compatibility across different vehicles, Nio's swap compatible battery packs all have similar dimensions. Nio's original 'standard range' battery was a 70 kWh NMC pack produced by CATL. In 2021, the 70 kWh battery was replaced by a new 75 kWh LFP-NMC dual chemistry battery, which consists of an undisclosed ratio of serially connected LFP and NMC battery cells assembled in a cell-to-pack format and a special pack management system, and it allows for a blend of each chemistries advantages: the higher energy density, better cold weather charging, and accurate state-of-charge readings from NMC cells, and the lower costs, lower wear, and improved safety from LFP cells. In 2024, the 75 kWh battery was updated to a fully LFP cell-to-pack battery pack which also features an increased peak DC fast charging rate of 170 kW compared to the previous pack's 140 kW rate.

In mid-2024, Nio started taking deliveries from WeLion for its new 150 kWh NMC batteries, which are the first ever mass produced automotive battery packs with a semi-solid state electrolyte. It feature battery cells with an energy density of 360 Wh/kg, and the pack weighs only 20 kilograms (44 lb) more than the 100 kWh pack with a conventional liquid electrolyte. Initially, this battery will only be available for short-term rental from a battery swap station, but a buyout option will eventually be offered later. At the announcement in February 2024, Nio said that each pack cost as much as an entire ET5 at launch, which has a starting price of CN¥ 328,000, or CN¥ 258,000 (approximately US$48,000, or US$38,000) with a battery subscription.

## Technologies


### Nomi AI

Nomi is Nio's digital assistant for the car dashboard to provide a closer engagement with its drivers and passengers and Nio claims is the world's first in-car AI system for production vehicles.

The Nomi Mate 2.0 features a circular AMOLED display and incorporates artificial intelligence with a human face-like interface that swivels and blinks its oval ‘eyes’ to address each vehicle occupant directly, depending on their location.

Nomi learns user preferences over time to understand the specific context of the car in relation to its owner. For example, Nomi can set the personal seating and steering wheel positions whenever it senses a driver approaching the vehicle. Users can also give Nomi verbal commands to adjust the cabin temperature, open or close windows, or snap an in-car selfie and have it displayed on the radio screen.


### Nio Pilot

Nio Pilot is the company's SAE level 2 semi-autonomous system that offers ADAS features. It launched with the introduction of Nio's ES8 model. Several over the air updates throughout 2018 and 2019 has enhanced Nio Pilot with features such as lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, highway pilot (Nio Navigate on Pilot, NNOP), traffic Jam assistance, auto lane change and more.

Nio Pilot sensor suite consists of 23 sensors, including a trifocal forward camera, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and a driver monitor camera. Nio was the first automaker to launch a car model utilizing Mobileye's EyeQ4 vision chip.

In August 2021, Lin Wenqin, a 31-year-old Chinese man, was killed after his Nio ES8 collided with a construction vehicle.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Nio's self-driving feature was still in beta, and could not deal with static obstacles. Though the vehicle's manual at the time clearly stated that the driver must take over when nearing construction sites, there was an issue regarding whether the feature was improperly marketed and unsafe. Lawyers of the family of the person killed called into question Nio's private access to the vehicle, which they argue could lead to the data being falsified.


### Aquila (Nio Autonomous Driving)

In November 2019, Nio announced a partnership with Mobileye to develop a consumer car equipped with Mobileye's complete Level 4 self-driving system called Aquila that could be sold to consumers by 2022. Aquila features 33 sensors, including 11 high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and two high-precision positioning units: V2X and ADMS.

The system was first on board of the Nio ET7. The company begun deliveries of the model in Q1 of 2022.

The new Nio Adam supercomputer is one of the most powerful platforms to run in a vehicle. With four Nvidia Drive Orin processors, Adam achieves more than 1,000 TOPS of performance. All of Nio's NT 2.0 platform vehicles — such as the ET7, ET5, ES7, EC7, 2nd Gen ES8 — are built on the Nio Adam supercomputer, with four Nvidia Drive Orinsystems-on-a-chip (SoC) at its core.

## Motorsport


### Formula E

The Nio team is one of the original Formula E teams, originally competing under the name Team China Racing. Before the first season was completed, they rebranded as NEXTEV TCR. In this inaugural season, their main driver Nelson Piquet Jr. became the FIA Formula E Driver's Champion, after winning two races in Long Beach and Moscow. The team was only able to achieve fourth in the constructor's championship though, in part due to a rotating line-up of second drivers that didn't achieve as consistent level of success as Piquet.

From season 2 onwards, Formula E opened up car development, with teams creating their own powertrains. Nio used their own design NEXTEV powertrain, but it saw a downturn in the team's performance for the constructor's championship, as they finished only 9th in season 2, 6th in season 3 and 8th in season 4. By this point, the team had morphed through NEXTEV, NEXTEV Nio until renamed simply Nio. Season 5 would see the team's meagre successes diminish further, as they languished 11th and last in the championship.

For season 6 (2019–20) the team was sold on to Lisheng Racing and renamed Nio 333 Racing. For the first time since season 1, Nio did not provide their own powertrain for the car, instead using the previous year's Dragon powertrain. It was rebranded under Nio's name and they remained classified as a manufacturer. This didn't change the team's fortunes, as they would go on to have their worst ever season, with neither Oliver Turvey nor Ma Qinghua being able to score any points in 2020. In season seven Nio improved marginally, as whilst Turvey and new arrival Tom Blomqvist amassed a total of 19 points throughout the campaign, the squad still remained in last place.

Nio once again changed their driver line-up for the 2021–22 Formula E season, as Blomqvist made way for former Red Bull and Williams junior Dan Ticktum.

The team ended its Formula E involvement after the 2022–23 season, with the team being rebranded as ERT Formula E Team for the 2023–24 season.


### World records

Nio set five records in their track-only EP9 for the fastest lap for an electric-powered car in the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Circuit Paul Ricard, Circuit of the Americas, and Shanghai International Circuit tracks.


## Public listing

In Sep 2018, Nio listed on NYSE after raising about $1 billion selling American depositary shares at $6.26 apiece. The shares started trading under the symbol NIO.

In 2018, while Nio was preparing for an IPO, the company told investors that they were building a new factory in Shanghai. Then in March 2019, Nio disclosed that the factory would never be built. According to former employees, construction had never started. Investors sued and accused Nio's promoters, which included Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, of negligence in examining Nio's financial statements.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
