## History

The first predecessor of Börse Stuttgart was founded in 1860 as *Industrie-Börsenverein* (a local industrial stock exchange association). On 12 March 1860, the first meeting of merchants trading in textiles took place in the Königsbau. On 11 February 1861, the *Stuttgarter Börsenverein* was founded, leading to the inauguration of a stock exchange, which served as the direct predecessor of the later Börse Stuttgart.

In May 1877, Charles I of Württemberg, along with the Stuttgart city council, issued a decree authorizing stock exchange and brokerage regulations. Following this decree, the courts began recognizing the prices set by the stock exchange.

Since 1866, Württemberg's daily newspapers had been printing a daily stock exchange price quote sheet, and in 1881, the first official quote sheet appeared. In the following years, the textile industry was replaced as the leading sector by mechanical and automotive engineering, chemicals and electrical engineering. In 1882, the stock exchange received its first telephone connection, which accelerated the processing of orders.

The German stock exchanges did not operate during World War I and Börse Stuttgart remained closed until 1919. As a result of the global economic crisis and massive price losses, Börse Stuttgart closed again for several months in 1931.

Due to air raids, Börse Stuttgart had to relocate in 1944. After World War II, business was resumed in November 1945 in the burnt-out building of the *Württembergische Landeskreditanstalt*. After the German currency reform of 1948 and the reorganisation of securities, official stock exchange trading was resumed.

Börse Stuttgart relocated within Stuttgart again in 1969 and in 1974, the electronic processing of stock exchange transactions began. The *Euwax* trading segment for securitised derivatives was established in 1999.

In November 2008, *Börse Stuttgart* acquired *Nordic Growth Market AB* (NGM), the second-largest stock exchange in Sweden. *NGM*'s NDX segment for securitised derivatives is not only active in Sweden, but also in Finland since 2010, in Norway since 2011, and in Denmark since 2016.

In 2014, Börse Stuttgart acquired 90% of the OTC trading network *Cats* from *Citigroup*. In 2017, Börse Stuttgart acquired the majority of shares in *BX Swiss AG*, completing the takeover in 2018. In January 2019, Börse Stuttgart launched the *Bison* app, at that time the only cryptocurrency trading app backed by a traditional stock exchange.

The institutional digital business of Börse Stuttgart was established in 2022. In 2023, *Axel Springer SE* and *SBI Digital Asset Holding* deepened their investment in the entire digital and crypto business of Börse Stuttgart, which has since been bundled under the *Börse Stuttgart Digital* brand. In March 2023, *Börse Stuttgart Digital Custody GmbH* received the licence for its operations as a crypto custodian from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).

In 2022, tokenised securities were traded on *BX Swiss* for the first time as part of a proof of concept. The trading transactions were processed via a blockchain. Börse Stuttgart also entered the zero-fee segment of securities trading. This included a *BX Swiss* offering in Switzerland and the launch of the regulated trading platform *TradeRebel* in Germany.

At the beginning of 2023, Börse Stuttgart launched the *Easy Euwax* segment, which enabled trading in structured securities without exchange fees. In December 2023, Börse Stuttgart established a strategic partnership with the Swiss financial company *Leonteq*, which acquired a 10% stake in *BX Swiss*.
