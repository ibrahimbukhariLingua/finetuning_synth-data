# Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business



The **Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business** is the graduate business school of the University of Pittsburgh located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although business education had its origins at the university in 1907, the Graduate School of Business was established in 1960 from a merger of its predecessors, the School of Business Administration and the Graduate School of Retailing. It was renamed in 1987 after businessman and university alumnus benefactor Joseph Katz.

The school offers a traditional, accelerated, part-time, business analytics, and executive Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees as well as Master of Science degrees in Accounting, Business Analytics, Finance, Information Systems, Management, Marketing, Supply Chain Management and several Ph.D. programs in business.

Katz is part of *Pitt Business*, which refers to the collective capacity of Katz and the College of Business Administration (offers undergraduate business degrees), and five education and research centers.


## History

The Katz School tracings its beginnings to the introduction of business education to the university in 1907 as the Evening School of Economics, Accounts, and Finance. Classes met in the Fulton Building on Sixth Street in Pittsburgh. Three years later in 1910, the School of Economics (named for the London School of Economics) was formally set up on Pitt's Oakland campus. In 1916, the school became one of the 17 founding members of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

By 1923 the school was renamed again, this time as the School of Business Administration. In 1949, it became only the third school in the United States to offer executive management training programs. The Graduate School of Business came into existence in 1960 out of a merger with the School of Business Administration and Graduate School of Retailing. Marshall A. Robinson was assigned as dean of the new school, which discontinued the issuance of undergraduate degrees and had an MBA class of 25 students its first year. That same year, the school launched its first doctoral program as well.

In 1963, the school began offering a one-year MBA program, making it the first in the United States to offer the accelerated program. It was one of the first business schools to offer an MBA and Master of Information Systems dual degree.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ For much of the 1960s, business classes were held in the Cathedral of Learning and Bruce Hall. In 1972, Lou Mervis and wife Myra established a trust fund for Pitt's Graduate School of Business with a $2 million donation ($14.6 million in 2023 dollars). In their honor, the building now known as Thackeray Hall was named after them and dedicated as home of the business school. In 1983, a new building was built to house the business school, and the name was carried over to it.

In 1987, the business school was renamed after Joseph Katz, Pitt alumnus and founder of Papercraft Corporation, following his $10 million donation ($26.8 million in 2023 dollars) to the university. In the 1990s Katz became the first US institution to offer an MBA in Central Europe, and in 2002 launched a bioengineering dual-degree program. The Katz Graduate School of Business now oversees the administration of the undergraduate College of Business Administration.

In 2015, Arjang A. Assad was named the dean of Katz. Under Assad's leadership, the school launched a part-time hybrid online/in-person MBA program and the full-time MBA program earned its best *U.S. News & World Report* ranking in school history.
