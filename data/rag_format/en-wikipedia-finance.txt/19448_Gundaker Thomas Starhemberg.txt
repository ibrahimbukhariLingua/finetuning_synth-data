## Biography

Gundakar was designated early for an ecclesiastical career, but after studying a while at the Collegium Germanicum et Hungaricum, he returned to Vienna and entered in the service of the Austrian Emperor.

He was quickly noticed for his financial talents and became a protégé of Prince Eugene of Savoy, who urged for financial reforms to finance the many wars the Empire was waging. Gundakar became vice-president of the Court Chamber in 1698 and its president in 1703, and was president of the Ministerial Bank Deputation from 1706 until his death.
