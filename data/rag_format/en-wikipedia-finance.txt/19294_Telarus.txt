# Telarus



**Telarus** is an American-based privately held technology services distributor that holds contracts with commercial network, cloud, CX, and cybersecurity providers with its operations in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.


## History

Telarus was founded in June 2002 in Huntington Beach, California by Adam Edwards and Patrick Oborn. The focus of the company was to offer improved service to commercial telecommunications clients.

Operating originally as a telecommunications broker, Telarus generated leads using web and search engine marketing. They followed up on each lead, contacted the T1 carrier for pricing, and compiled each quote by hand.

In 2003, Oborn designed the initial concept for what was to be called GeoQuote, described as a software that allows a user to access multiple carrier price options with a single search. Oborn partnered with Aaron Lieberman to write the code that could compute pricing based upon loop distance (the distance from the customer's central office to the carrier point of presence) or through direct access to a carrier pricing Application Programming Interface (API).

The prototype of GeoQuote was completed in August 2003. The software was embedded in Telarus' research tool, named ShopforT1.com.

In November 2003, Telarus, Inc. filed for a United States provisional patent to protect the idea and coding architecture behind the GeoQuote concept.

On September 30, 2004, Telarus filed the non-provisional patent application, which was accepted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 24, 2009. GeoQuote is now protected by US Patent Number(s) 7,496,184 and 7,916,844.

In 2008, the company announced that it was adding the world's first fiber route mapping capabilities to GeoQuote.

In May 2022, Telarus launched SolutionVue, a software that offers detailed consulting advice through a series of discovery questions.
