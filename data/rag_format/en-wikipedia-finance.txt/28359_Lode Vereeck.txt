## Controversy

In 2018, it was reported Hasselt University had started an investigation into Vereeck over possible inappropriate behaviour towards female students. The university board also dismissed Vereeck due to a breach of trust with the management and the students. Vereeck responded by claiming the accusations were a political smear campaign and pointed out that no official complaints had been filed by any students. In 2019, the Belgian Public Prosecution Service dismissed the investigation due to a lack of evidence.
