## M&A which failed to complete

| Acquirer | Target | Year | Deal value (US$) | Notes | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vivendi | Ubisoft | 2016 | 6,400,000,000 | In 2018, Vivendi agreed to stop pursuing its hostile takeover bid for Ubisoft and sell its shares to various investors, including Tencent. Vivendi had completely divested its stake in Ubisoft by March 2019. |
| Electronic Arts | Take-Two Interactive | 2008 | 1,900,000,000 | Although Take-Two were interested in merging with another company at the time, Strauss Zelnick and Take-Two's board of directors considered EA's cash offer inadequate. In September 2008, EA gave up on the acquisition and let the offer expire. |
| Take-Two Interactive | Vivendi Universal Games | 2003 | 1,000,000,000 | Take-Two planned to acquire Vivendi's video game division, which at the time was up for sale as part of the parent company's plan to sell $7.7 billion in assets. Take-Two's offer was far short of the $1.6 billion Vivendi sought for the business. Ultimately the deal never came to pass and Vivendi Games would later merge with Activision to form Activision Blizzard. |
| Take-Two Interactive | Codemasters | 2020 | 994,000,000 | Take-Two offered to acquire Codemasters in November 2020 for approximately US$994 million and Codemasters subsequently accepted the deal. However, in December 2020, Electronic Arts placed a rival offer of $1.2 billion, 14% higher than Take-Two's bid, which Codemasters' board of directors agreed to instead. Take-Two formally withdrew its offer in January 2021, ceding to EA's bid. EA fully acquired Codemasters on February 21, 2021. |
| Playtika | Rovio | 2023 | 813,000,000 | Playtika held preliminary discussions with Rovio about a potential acquisition in January 2023. Playtika made a €9.05 per share all-cash offer to Rovio's board of directors. Those discussions ended with no deal the following March and Rovio stated that it would seek merger discussions with other parties instead. |
| GT Interactive | MicroProse | 1997 | 250,000,000 | Despite the merger agreement being signed and unanimously approved by both companies shareholders, the merger was called off two months after the deal was signed. The merger was reportedly called off due to "fundamental" disagreement over the handling of research and development costs. In the following years, MicroProse was acquired by Hasbro. |
| Square Enix | Tecmo | 2008 | 200,000,000 | Tecmo rejected Square Enix's buyout offer, opting instead for a merger of equals with Koei. |
| Elevation Partners | Eidos Interactive | 2005 | 136,300,000 | Elevation attempted to acquire Eidos in March 2005 as the newly formed firm's first acquisition, but were outbid by SCi, who ultimately acquired Eidos in May 2005. |
| ZeniMax Media | Relic Entertainment | 2013 | 26,300,000 | At THQ's bankruptcy auction, ZeniMax bid $26.3 million for Relic Entertainment and the Company of Heroes IP, but were subsequently outbid by Sega by only $300K, with Sega ultimately acquiring Relic. |
