Remgro was incorporated in 1968 as Rembrandt S.A. Limited (Remsa), a wholly owned subsidiary of JSE listed Rembrandt Group. In 2000, the Rembrandt Group of companies underwent a corporate restructure that led to the consolidation of the group's investments from four to two publicly traded holding companies i.e. Remgro and VenFin. VenFin acquired the group's technology-orientated assets while Remgro acquired the traditional assets. After the spin-off of the BAT stake in 2008, Remgro and VenFin were merged again in 2009.
