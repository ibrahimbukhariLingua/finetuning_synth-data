**State ECU** *(also known as **State Employees Credit Union of New Mexico** or **SECU New Mexico**)* is a federal not-for-profit credit union headquartered in Santa Fe, New Mexico. As of 2019, State ECU has $569 million in assets, over 48,000 members, and eight branches in the New Mexico. Deposits by the members are regulated and insured by National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) under latter's western region jurisdiction.


## History

State Employees Credit Union was formed in 1958 to serve the counties of Bernalillo, Do√±a Ana, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, Santa Fe, San Miguel, and Valencia.

In 2016, it got a new logo and a shortened name - "State ECU", to distinguish itself from other states' SECUs.


## Community support programs

To overcome the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in New Mexico, State ECU created the *State ECU Covid Relief Fund* to support local businesses and nonprofits.
