### Ven Currency

Launched in 2007, Ven is a Digital currency used by members of Hub Culture to buy, share and trade knowledge, goods and services. Members can use Ven at any 'Pavilion' or for micropayments online. The value of Ven is determined on the financial markets from a basket of currencies, commodities and carbon futures. It trades against other major currencies at floating exchange rates. Global pricing for Ven is provided by Thomson Reuters.


### Pavilions

Hub Culture operates temporary and permanent coworking project spaces called 'Pavilions'. Temporary locations have included Copenhagen to coincide with COP15, Cancún to coincide with COP16, and Durban for COP17.
