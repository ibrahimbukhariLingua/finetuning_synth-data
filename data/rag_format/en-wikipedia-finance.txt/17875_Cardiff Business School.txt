## History


### Economics at University College Cardiff (1899-1988)

Economics is the oldest part of the business school, having been taught at Cardiff since the late 1890s as part of the Political Science department and corresponding degree. The "Department of Economics and Political Science" was set up in 1903 with one lecturer, Henry Jevons (the son of William Stanley Jevons) who was made Professor in his final year 1911. From 1911 to 1946 the head of department was W.J Roberts. In 1922, he was joined by Stanley Parris. In 1946, professor Brinley Thomas CBE became head of the department and there followed an expansion with the subjects covered to include statistics and accounting. By 1962, there were seven lecturers in the department, and in 1972 Sir Bryan Hopkin became the second professor among 11 lecturers. In 1973, Professor Ken D. George became the head of department and there was further expansion. In 1988, as a result of the merger of UCC with University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, the economics department at University College Cardiff moved into the recently created Cardiff Business School.
