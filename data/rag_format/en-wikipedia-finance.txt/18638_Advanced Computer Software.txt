# Advanced Computer Software



**Advanced Computer Software Group Ltd.** (operating as **OneAdvanced**) is a British private company founded by Vin Murria in 2008. The company has its headquarters in Birmingham, West Midlands and provides information technology services including hosting and cloud based systems to the NHS and many other organisations. Through various acquisitions, in 2016 it became the third largest software provider in the UK market while employing over 2,400 people with a customer base of more than 20,000 organisations.


## History

The company was founded by Vin Murria in 2008. Originally listed on the Alternative Investment Market in 2008 with a cash value of £3 million, it was bought by Vista Equity Partners in 2014 for £765 million. From the 18% stake Murria held in she took £140.2m from the sale making her one of the wealthiest women in the UK. Murria was awarded an OBE for services to the UK digital economy and advancing women in the software sector in the 2018 New Year Honours.

At the time of sale, Vista brought in a new leadership team including Chief Executive Officer Gordon Wilson, and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Hicks.

In August 2019, Vista sold a 50% stake to BC Partners for £2 billion including debt.

In 2023, the company undertook a strategy refresh, alongside changes to the executive management team, appointing Simon Walsh as Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Dews as Chief Financial Officer and Andrew Henderson as Chief Technology Officer. The aim of the strategy refresh was stated to prioritise resources into high growth market sectors and product categories. Part of this refresh included updating the operating name from "Advanced" to "OneAdvanced".


### Health and Care Cyber Incident

In August 2022, the company experienced a cybersecurity incident caused by LockBit 3.0 ransomware. Adastra, Caresys, Odyssey, Carenotes, Crosscare, Staffplan and eFinancials products were all affected, with downtime and recovery lasting for several months.

Perpetrators of the attack were able to extract information relating to 16 Staffplan and Caresys customers. 82,946 people were affected by the breach which included phone numbers and medical records, as well as details of how to gain entry to the homes of 890 people who were receiving care at home.

The cyber attack including resulting remediation and outage credits cost the group £18.2 million in 2023 with a further £2.7 million provisioned for additional expenditure in future years.

The Information Commissioner's Office announced in August 2024 a provisional decision to impose a fine of £6.09m on the company, following an initial finding that the provider failed to implement measures to protect the personal information.

In January 2024, IBM announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire application modernization capabilities from Advanced.
