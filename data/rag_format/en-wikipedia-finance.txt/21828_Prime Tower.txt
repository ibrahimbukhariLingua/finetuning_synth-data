Prime Tower


# Prime Tower



The **Prime Tower**, also named "Maag-Tower" in an earlier stage of planning, is a skyscraper in Zürich, Switzerland, used mainly as office space. At a height of 126 metres (413 ft), it was the tallest building in Switzerland from 2011 until 2015, when the Roche Tower in Basel (standing at 178 m (584 ft)) was completed.

The building is located near the Hardbrücke railway station in Zürich West of the *Industriequartier*. The tower replaced an industrial facility.

According to its developers, the tower's construction, which took 15 years to plan and execute, was a financial success, with its valuation based on lease rates exceeding the construction cost by CHF 110 million.

A webcam on top of the building offers a 360° view of Zürich.
