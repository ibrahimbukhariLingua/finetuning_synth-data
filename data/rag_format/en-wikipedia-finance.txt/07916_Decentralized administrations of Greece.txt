Decentralized administrations of Greece


# Decentralized administrations of Greece



The **decentralized administrations** (Greek: αποκεντρωμένες διοικήσεις, *apokentroménes dioikíseis*) is a tier of the Greek public administration of Greece. They are not a Local Self-Government Organization, albeit they supervise the Administrative Regions and Municipalities within their territory. They were created in January 2011 as part of a far-reaching reform of the country's administrative structure, the Kallikratis reform (Law 3852/2010).

They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship. Beyond that, they are tasked with supervising the first and second-level self-governing bodies: the regions and municipalities.

They are run by a government-appointed general secretary, assisted by an advisory council drawn from the regional governors and the representatives of the municipalities.
