In July 2008, at the initiative of Gordeev, the Federation Council unanimously supported a parliamentary request to the Government of the Russian Federation to make significant changes to the application of the federal law “Protection of Cultural Heritage Sites”. As a result of the request, 35 architectural monuments were taken under state protection. During the term, Gordeev submitted to the State Duma a number of draft laws and amendments aiming to improve protection of the Russian cultural heritage.
