Retailing in South Korea


# Retailing in South Korea



**Retailing in South Korea** consists of hypermarkets, department stores, flea markets, traditional markets, and underground shopping malls. Hypermarkets sell dry goods and groceries, similar to Western supercentres. Traditional markets are also popular throughout South Korea.


## Hypermarkets

South Korea's's large stores usually cover over 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft) and sell self-service food, household goods and home appliances at a discount. Food products (fresh and processed foods) account for 50 percent of sales, followed by household goods and appliances. Hypermarkets include E-Mart, Homeplus and Lotte Mart, as well as warehouse stores such as Costco, Traders and Big Market.


### History of hypermarkets

Hypermarkets were introduced to South Korea in 1993. Shinsegae opened its first E-mart store in Changdong-gu. The first hypermarket was a warehouse with minimal service and an uncluttered interior. During the late 1990s, hypermarkets included more luxurious interior, better service and facilities designed to match Korean buying habits. In 1996, Korean companies and foreign global retailers such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour began to compete; Wal-Mart and Carrefour withdrew from the South Korean market in 2006 and 2007. When Homeplus acquired 35 Homever stores from E.Land Retail in 2008, three retailers—E-mart (1993), Lotte Mart (1998) and Homeplus (1999)—took over the market.


### Sales

Hypermarket sales were about $3.4 billion as of 2013, at 483 stores nationwide. Korea's 2013 retail market was $310 billion, with hypermarkets accounting for about 10.8 percent of the total. This is the highest percentage of major retail outlets such as department stores, supermarkets and convenience stores.

South Korea's three largest hypermarkets (E-mart, Lotte Mart and Homeplus) had 395 stores in 2013; E-Mart had 148 stores (37.5 percent), Homeplus had 139 (35.2 percent), and Lotte Mart had 108 (27.3 percent). E-Mart and Lotte Mart's outlets included warehouse stores.


## Department stores

A department store carries a variety of products in a number of price ranges. They generally offer more customer service, and are located in cities and rural areas.

In South Korea, department stores are defined by the Distribution Industry Development Act as retail stores with more than 3,000 square meters of floor space, diverse inventory and customer-friendly facilities. Under the law, the stores are registered and managed by local governments as large stores. Large stores include department stores, large marts, shopping centers, shopping malls, specialty stores, and other large retail stores. Most are registered as department stores; some are shopping centers or shopping malls, and some outlet and shopping-mall buildings have been registered as department stores. Lotte, Hyundai and Shinsegae are the largest nationwide department store chains, in terms of market share.


### History of department stores
