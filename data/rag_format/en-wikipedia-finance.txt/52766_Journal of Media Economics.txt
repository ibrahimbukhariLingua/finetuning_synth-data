# Journal of Media Economics



The ***Journal of Media Economics*** is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering all aspects of media economics published by Routledge.

The current editors-in-chief are Michel Clement (Marketing & Media, Hamburg Business School, University of Hamburg) and Jan. U. Becker (Kühne Logistics University, Hamburg).

The ***Journal of Media Economics*** has appointed a number of Area Editors (AEs) that are outstanding experts in their field. Specifically, the AEs represent the research fields: Media Economics, Econometrics, Analytics, Media Management, Entertainment Science, Media Strategy, Innovation Management & Digital Media, and Technology Management.

The journal was established in 1988 with Robert G. Picard as founding editor.


## Aims & Scope

The ***Journal of Media Economics*** publishes original research on the economics and policy of mediated communication, focusing on firms, markets, and institutions. Reflecting the increasing diversity of analytical approaches employed in economics and recognizing that policies promoting social and political objectives may have significant economic impacts on media, the journal encourages submissions reflecting the insights of diverse disciplinary perspectives and research methodologies, both empirical and theoretical.

Key topics discussed in the journal are media economics, media strategy, media policy, media management, econometrics, entertainment marketing, innovation management & digital media, and technology management.


## Idea Forum

Given the dynamic context of media, papers in the Idea Forum address novel and emerging topics or methods in the field of media economics – theoretically or empirically. Very new topics (e.g., the impact of COVID-19) that emerge with rather limited data available, but that are considered as important, novel, and worth to be discussed are of interest for this forum.
