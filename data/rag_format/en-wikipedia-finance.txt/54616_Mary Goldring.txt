# Mary Goldring



**Mary Sheila Goldring** OBE (born 1923 - died 2016) was a British business journalist and broadcaster.

An economist who graduated from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Goldring turned to journalism in the late 1940s and became a member of staff at *The Economist*, where for a long time she was its Business Editor, rising to the rank of Deputy Editor alongside Norman McRae. She left the paper suddenly in spring 1974 following a dispute over its editorship in the wake of the surprise departure of Alastair Burnet, who left to become editor of the *Daily Express*.

Goldring then moved to the BBC and meantime also wrote a weekly column for the *Investors Chronicle*, edited at the time by Andreas Whittam Smith. In 1976 she became one of the main regular presenters of BBC Radio 4's *Analysis* series of analytical authored current-affairs documentaries. She developed it into a flagship programme, staying with it until 1987. She also made five series of television documentaries, the *Goldring Audit*, for Channel 4 screened from 1993 to 1998.

In the late 1960s, Mary Goldring was *The Economist*'s aviation correspondent, a post in which she was highly critical of the development programme for the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic aircraft, on the basis of noise, pollution and above all what she predicted would be disastrous commercial economics.
