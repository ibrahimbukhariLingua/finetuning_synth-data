It representing the interests of 11 national Picture Associations in Europe and further individual Agencies in EU-Institutions and international organizations.


## History

CEPIC was founded in Berlin in 1993, where it still has its Head Office. In 1997, it received Observer Status at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). CEPIC was registered in Paris in 1999. In 2006 CEPIC became an associate member of International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC). Until 2009 CEPIC was known as the *Coordination of European Picture Agencies*. The change of the name to *Centre of the Picture Industry* is a result of the advancement to a more global orientation of the organisation.


## Structure

Currently, 883 Picture Agencies with about 50,000 photographers are represented by CEPIC. Members of CEPIC are mainly small and medium-sized companies, national museums and archives, which promote professional photography and footage in Press, Culture and Illustration.
The 7 members of the CEPIC Committee are elected every 2 years by representatives of the 11 national Picture Associations.


## Goals and Activities

CEPIC promotes the exchange of information between Pictures Agencies from all over the world with its annual Congress, which takes place in another European city every year (see below). CEPIC stands for the defense of a balanced market. Contract templates and guidelines for good business relations between photographers, Picture Agencies and users are developed on a regular basis. Together with ICOMP, CEPIC works on the protection of competitive market conditions.

Another main issue is the protection of intellectual property and the payment of photographers. CEPIC speaks up for ethical codes and for the rights of photographers and Picture Agencies.

In 2009, CEPIC issued a critical statement on the US-American Google Book Settlement. This statement was submitted to the European Commission in cooperation with ICOMP, the German Book Trade Association (*Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels*), the Internet Archive/Open Book Alliance and EBLIDA.

CEPIC is, furthermore, active in the discussion about so-called Orphan Works and supports a sector specific solution. To prevent pictures from becoming orphan works, CEPIC recommends the improvement of legal and technological means of protection.
