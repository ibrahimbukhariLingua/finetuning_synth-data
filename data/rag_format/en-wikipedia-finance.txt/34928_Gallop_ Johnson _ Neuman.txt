Gallop, Johnson & Neuman


# Gallop, Johnson & Neuman



**Gallop, Johnson & Neuman, L.C.** was a law firm based in St. Louis County, Missouri. Its founding was in 1976 with 10 original attorneys. In the 80's it grew to become the 12th largest corporate law firm in the United States. The firm's headquarters was in the Interco Tower in downtown Clayton, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis County. The firm no longer practices law and entered a wind down phase on May 1, 2012. The reason given on its website was that, "Recently, like all too many companies in America, the law firm of Gallop, Johnson and Neuman has struggled with the challenges resulting from the nation’s current slow economy. Because of those challenges, Gallop has decided that effective May 1, 2012 it will no longer engage in the practice of law and will begin the process of winding down the business of the law firm." Thereafter, in 2013, a defunct Gallop settled a long-standing series of lawsuits over a trash-transfer station in St. Louis County.


## Organization

The firm was organized into six different departments, namely Business Services, Estate Planning, Government Law & Relations, Labor & Employment, Litigation, and Real Estate & Construction, within which individual practice groups operated.

The managing partner of the firm was Thomas J. Campbell, and the general counsel was John W. Traeger.


## Green committee and initiatives

Gallop, Johnson & Neuman was the first St. Louis area law firm to become a certified partner in the American Bar Association-Environmental Protection Agency Law Office Climate Challenge, a program that encourages law offices to become better environmental and energy stewards. It was the mission of the firm's Green Committee to implement sustainable, firm-wide measures to promote conservation of energy, water and natural resources by reducing, reusing and recycling and by purchasing environmentally sound products.

Gallop, Johnson & Neuman was also a member of the United States Green Building Council, a non-profit organization committed to expanding sustainable building practices. Additionally, the firm purchased Renewable Energy Credits to further the Green initiatives.
