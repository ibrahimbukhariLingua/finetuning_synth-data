## Career

Zaw established Manaw Thidar, the first company under the Shwe Byain Phyu (SBP) Group in 1996. Co-led by Zaw and his wife, Tin Latt Min, the company provided logistics services to Joint Corporation 6 (JC-6).

In 2010, as Myanmar Petroleum Products Enterprise (MPPE) began privatizing state-owned petrol stations, SBP expanded its operations to include retail, owning 29 petrol stations.

Zaw also ventured into the marine products export sector, using his fishery experience to diversify revenue streams. A subsidiary, Eastern Power International, was established in 2002 to manage these operations.

In 2009 Zaw further diversified by establishing Theint Win Htet Manufacturing, specializing in PP plastic bag production, with a daily capacity of 100,000 bags, which are distributed across Myanmar.

For the tax years 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 Zaw was recognized as one of the top taxpayers and was commended by President Win Myint for his tax contributions.

In March 2022 Singapore-based Investcom Pte Ltd, a joint venture between the Lebanese M1 Investment Group and Myanmar's Shwe Byain Phyu conglomerate, acquired Telenor Myanmar. Following the acquisition, concerns about ties to the Myanmar military and data privacy emerged. However, in April 2022, the new parent company addressed these concerns, committing to uphold the data privacy policies of its predecessor. ATOM Myanmar was launched in June 2022.
