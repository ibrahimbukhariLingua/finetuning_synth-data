Following Mahendra's appointment as deputy minister of foreign affairs in October 2019, it was reported that President Jokowi had indicated that he should take on two main tasks: concluding trade negotiations with the United States on specific matters and taking steps to support the Indonesian palm oil industry. Outlining his duties to the media, Mahendra noted a US review of the Generalized System of Preferences was underway and that Indonesia's involvement would need immediate attention. A successful outcome, he observed, could lead to a doubling of Indonesia's trade with the US within five years. Mahendra said that his second main task would focus on "neutralizing the EU's unfriendly position" on the palm oil industry in Indonesia. Earlier in the year, in March, the EU had decided to phase out the use of palm oil by 2030 because of deforestation concerns. Indonesia planned to engage the EU on the policy.

A short time later, in early December 2019, Mahendra took steps to voice concern on behalf of Indonesia about the way that the narrative about palm oil issues in Indonesia was presented in the international media. In response to a report aired on international CNN reports entitled "Borneo is burning: How the world's demand for palm oil is driving deforestation in Indonesia", Mahendra claimed that the report was not constructive and provided a false narrative. He noted that the Indonesian government was taking steps to address the problem and that the Indonesian government's efforts should receive international support.
