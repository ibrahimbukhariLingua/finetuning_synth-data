Confederate States Department of the Treasury


# Confederate States Department of the Treasury



The **Confederate States Department of the Treasury** was the department of the executive branch of the Confederate States of America responsible for the administration of the economic affairs of the Confederacy. These affairs including the issuing of debt, the collecting of taxes, the printing of money, and the administration of customs. The Department of the Treasury was led by the Secretary of the Treasury, a position which was established in legislation passed by the Provisional Confederate Congress in 1861.


## History

While not explicitly established in the Confederate Constitution, a mandate for the establishment of the Treasury Department can be inferred from repeated references throughout the document referring to the "Treasury of Confederate States". The Department of the Treasury was officially established by an act of the Confederate Provisional Congress.

One of the early acts of the Provisional Confederate Congress assembled in Montgomery pertained to the status of the federally employed customs official at customs houses which were in Confederate territory following the secession of states in which said customs houses were located. This issue was resolved by passing a bill assuming these customs agents into the employ of the Confederacy as part of the Department of the Treasury. The bill was passed into law on February 14, 1861 effecting such transfer of employment.

On March 9, 1861 the Provisional Congress authorized the printing of Confederate currency, in the form of paper treasury notes, amounting up to a total of $1 million (CSA).
