## Monetary theory of Bendixen

The supply of money should not increase faster than production, because as production increases, the ratio of the circulation of money (notes that acquire goods) and goods themselves should remain constant, otherwise prices and values would become unstable. Friedrich Bendixen died at the age of 55 in Hamburg and was buried in the Ohlsdorf cemetery there. The preserved gravesite is located in plan square Z 12 southwest of the North Pond.
