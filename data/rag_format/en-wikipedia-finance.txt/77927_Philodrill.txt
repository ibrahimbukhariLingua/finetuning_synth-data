## History

One of the leading conglomerates in the Philippines, the Philodrill Corporation was established on June 26, 1969. It is considered one of the pioneers in the industry of oil exploration in the country, and its headquarter is located in Mandaluyong, Philippines.

In 1989, its petition to amend its primary business purpose to become a diversified holding company was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The move was meant to cushion the risks associated with the petroleum industry. However, it again petitioned the SEC to make petroleum exploration and production as its primary purpose while retaining the holding company as secondary purpose, which was permitted on April 13, 2009. The SEC approved its application to renew its corporate term for the next 50 years on January 18, 2018, with the new term taking effect by June 25, 2019.

In 2006, the company announced that it's divesting its interest in Penta Capital Investment Corporation, an investment house that provides money management services including underwriting services, in order to focus on the core business of oil exploration. The PSE and SEC approved its stock rights offering worth 38.37 billion stock rights, with the offer scheduled in 2009.

When the government opened the Fourth Philippine Energy Contracting Round, the Philodrill Corporation formed consortium with Philex Mining Corporation, Philex Petroleum Corporation, and Pitkin Petroleum Plc of UK in 2012. to bid for new oil and gas blocks.

Public ownership of the company was at 47.78%. The Ramos family, which founded and managed the National Bookstore retail chain, owns 8.879% or 17.03 billion common shares. The Alakor Corporation, which is led by the Ramos family, owns 9.07% or 17.5 billion shares.
