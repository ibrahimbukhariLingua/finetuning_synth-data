# United States five-hundred-dollar bill



The **United States five-hundred-dollar bill** **(US$500)** is an obsolete denomination of United States currency.

Since 1969 banks are required to send $500 bills to the United States Department of the Treasury for destruction.


## History

The United States five-hundred-dollar bill was printed from 1861 to 1945. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) continued to issue the notes until 1969. The notes did not see much circulation among the public because they were printed to facilitate transactions between banks. On July 14, 1969, the United States Department of the Treasury announced that all notes in denominations greater that US$100 would be discontinued. Since 1969 banks are required to send any $500 bill to the Department of the Treasury for destruction.

There were several versions of the note. Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall appears on the obverse of the 1918 five-hundred-dollar bill. The note was a large-size bill measuring 8 cm (3.1 in) x 19 cm (7.5 in). A new small-size 500 bill was issued in 1928 and 1934. The new version featured former president William McKinley's portrait.


### Efforts to reissue

In 2017 American economist Jay Zagorsky suggested that the United States should reissue the $500 bill. He suggested that a disaster could shut down commerce and the high denomination bill could ensure against an economic collapse. In June 2024, Representative Paul Gosar introduced a bill into Congress which would, if passed, require the Treasury to issue $500 bills featuring President Donald Trump.
