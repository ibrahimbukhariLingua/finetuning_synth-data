# Julie Macklowe



**Julie Macklowe** (née **Lerner**, December 1977) is an American socialite, philanthropist and entrepreneur. She is married to Billy Macklowe, son of real-estate developer Harry B. Macklowe.

In 2021, she released The Macklowe, an American single malt whisky. She previously founded vbeauté, a former skincare line for women.


## Early life and education

Macklowe was born in Aspen and raised in Arizona, the daughter of Frank Lerner. She took over her grandfather's T-shirt company and transformed it into a women's sportswear company. She completed her B.A. in economics and B.S. in commerce, graduating magna cum laude from the University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce in 1999. It was there that she received an early induction into New York finance circles while taking John Griffin's class.


## Career

In 2000, Macklowe worked with Chase Capital Management (now JPMorgan Partners) in Seoul and Hong Kong, where she helped structure leverage buyouts. Between 2003 and 2006, Macklowe was the managing director of Metropolitan Capital Management, and, in 2006, she joined the investment firm SAC, where she managed investment portfolios for Sigma Capital Management.

In 2009, backed by Millennium Partners, Macklowe opened her own $250 million hedge fund, Macklowe Asset Management. In October 2010, Macklowe closed the fund to pursue her own investments in fashion businesses. In an interview the following year, she said, "I haven’t looked at a stock since the day I left.”


### BaubleBar

In December 2010, Macklowe's first fashion industry investment, BaubleBar, launched with help from Accel Partners. The online startup, sells jewelry directly from suppliers and designers, which normally work with retailers. Macklowe helped the company in its initial fundraising efforts and currently sits on the company's board.

Macklowe was the muse for Zang Toi, for his Spring 2013 collection and debuted on the runway show September 9, 2012.


### Vbeauté

Macklowe launched her own skincare company, Vbeauté on November 1, 2011. Vbeauté started as a luxury, travel-friendly toiletry kit that meets TSA regulations for carry on luggage and was developed by CRB Cosmetics, a research lab in Switzerland. The inspiration for the company came in 2009, when she was flying to a friend's wedding in France, when her toiletries were confiscated by security. In 2011, the company raised $4 million and sold at 37 stores. In September 2014, vbeauté launched a deal with the Home Shopping Network (HSN) to be sold exclusively at HSN and select boutiques. Vbeauté sold a wide range of luxury skin care products, known for containing the Alpine Rose as a main ingredient.

Vbeauté went out of business in 2019.


### The Macklowe

In December 2021, Macklowe launched The Macklowe, an American single malt whiskey. Macklowe is distilled in limited quantities, and, according to The New York Times, retails for $1,500. It is available at various New York bars and restaurants. Macklowe told The Wall Street Journal that decades of curating her own collection of whiskey inspired her to create her own brand.

Macklowe partnered with Scottish distiller and blender Ian MacMillan, known for his work with Bunnahabhain and Bladnoch. The brand follows a farm-to-table philosophy, which includes locally sourced malted barley. The product is made, matured, and bottled in Kentucky using traditional bourbon production techniques, using a column still and copper doubler. The product is bottled in hand-crafted, hand-painted bottles that are designed after flasks.

Jean-Georges’ restaurants, Marea, Carbone, Le Pavillon, Casa Cipriani, and Bemelmans at the Carlyle all serve the brand.


## Personal life

In 2004, Julie married Billy Macklowe, son of Harry B. Macklowe, and founder of the William Macklowe Company. The couple lives in Manhattan and Long Island with their daughters. In addition to their residence in New York City, the couple owns houses in both Aspen and the Hamptons.

In 2008, Macklowe was named Vogue magazine's "It Girl".

In 2011, Macklowe hosted her 34th birthday party, which also featured the launch of her new vBeauté skin care line. The event was part of a cooperative effort to raise money for VH1's Save the Music Foundation.

In December 2022, Macklowe's 45th birthday party made headlines for its high-profile 600-person guest list and risqué dress code of "leather and lingerie". The party, its guests, and fashion were featured in New York Magazine.

Macklowe has been photographed at various social and philanthropic events wearing a range of designers including Dolce & Gabbana, Calvin Klein, Balenciaga and Oscar de la Renta. She has attended events such as the Couture Council and New Yorkers for Children fall gala. Macklowe also collects ball gowns, some of which have been showcased in the *Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty* art exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
