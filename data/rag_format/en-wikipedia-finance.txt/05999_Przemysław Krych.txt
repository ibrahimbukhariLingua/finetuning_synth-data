On September 23, 2019, he gave an interview to Bloomberg Businessweek, in which he talked about the behind-the-scenes of the arrest. July 1, 2021, in an interview for Onet.pl mentioned the former spokesman of PiS – Adam Hofman, who, after Krych was released, offered him a meeting with Zbigniew Ziobro (at that time the Minister of Justice) and his wife Patrycja Kotecka to "clarify the situation". Another person mentioned by Krych in the interview was Krzysztof Porowski – a businessman from Sosnowiec, once accused of extortion of 5 mln PLN from the Social Insurance Institution and the corruption of the vice-president of the Katowice District Court. Before Krych's arrest, he offered to "solve the problem" for a bribe of EUR 1.5 million, and during Krych's arrest, he also offered Krych's business partner, his release for the same amount.

Meanwhile, the cases involving businessmen targeted by the authorities, accused of corruption by Ziobro's prosecutors, have gone quiet. I’d like to break that silence.".
