## History

Bisnode traces its roots back to Sveriges Handelskalendar, a trade directory which was founded in 1859 and became the starting pistol for Bonnier's business-information operations. In 1982, Bonnier-owned Affärsdata started publishing business information digitally. In 1986, Bonnier gave tech entrepreneur Lars Save and Bonnier executive Håkan Ramsin a budget of 15 million SEK to create a business plan for making digital business information services profitable.

In 1989, Bisnode's predecessor Bonnier Business Services was founded. During the first half of the 1990s, the company carried out a number of acquisitions of different sizes. It specialized in purchasing problem companies and making them flourish. In 1999, Bonnier's business information was separated from the customer-information operations and named Bonnier Affärsinformation (BAF). In 2005, the private equity company Ratos acquired 70 percent of BAF, which purchased Infodata from Ratos.

In 2006, the group was renamed Bisnode. In 2012, under the leadership of the new CEO Lars Pettersson, a significant change was set in motion, with the goal to unite all Bisnode-owned companies in Europe under the Bisnode brand. Completed in 2014, Bisnode's 9 400 square-meter head-office building is situated alongside the E4 in Solna.

As of December 2020, Bisnode was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet.
