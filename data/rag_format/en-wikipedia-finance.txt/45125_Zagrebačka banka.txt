# Zagrebačka banka



**Zagrebačka banka d.d.** is the largest bank in Croatia, owned by Milan-based UniCredit.


## Overview

Zagrebačka banka was formed in 1977, intended to provide loans for local companies, taking over some former assets and operations including from the City Savings Bank of Zagreb. In the late 1980s these were merged again to form the very first banking joint stock company in the former SFR Yugoslavia.

It was the first Croatian bank to become fully privatised in 1989 and the first one to be listed at the Zagreb Stock Exchange in 1995. In March 2002, ZABA was acquired by the UniCredit Group of Italy. As the country's largest bank, its assets account for 25 percent of total assets in the Croatian banking sector, and its services are used by 80,000 businesses and 1.1 million citizens. It remains one of 24 companies included in the CROBEX share index.


## Controversies

Zagrebačka Banka was an employer to Ankica Lepej (1948 – 2022) the first prominent whistleblower in modern Croatian history, who uncovered a secret bank account and funds of the wife of the Croatian president Franjo Tuđman. Bank originally offered a million-kuna reward in *Jutarnji list* for any info on the whistleblower. Lepej presented herself with a lawyer and, subsequently, got fired by the bank (with only 11 months left to retirement) and arrested. The charges were eventually dropped, after Franjo Tuđman's death.
