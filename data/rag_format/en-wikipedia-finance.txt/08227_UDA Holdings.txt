## History

Urban Development Authority of Malaysia (UDA) was established on 12 November 1971 under the Ministry of Public Enterprise.

As a government agency, between 1971 and 1979, UDA had developed 118 commercial projects â€“ 30 in the Federal Territory, 15 in Terengganu, 14 in Kelantan and 10 each in Perak and Kedah. These projects also include joint ventures with other government agencies such as MARA, Perkim, FOA and other cooperative societies, and also projects state development corporations particularly in less developed states. These projects have assisted bumiputras in business.

UDA was also responsible for the Kuala Lumpur comprehensive urban renewal programme in the 1970s and 1980s, which include the 16-storey Cahaya Suria, opened in late 1977, Puduraya and Dayabumi.

In 1996, it was incorporated and changed its full name to UDA Holdings Sendirian Berhad (UDA Holdings Private Limited). Later in 1999, it changed its status to a public limited company and changed its name to UDA Holdings Berhad. It was subsequently publicly listed on the Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on 18 November 1999, being the most active stock on that day.

### Development

UDA develops and reappropriates urban structures as it sees fit.

The development projects of UDA are implemented by its subsidiaries, PNS Development, UDA-Murni Development, UDAPEC, SBBU, and PERUDA Development.

A joint venture development between UDA, EPF and EcoWorld was announced in 2016 to develop the Bukit Bintang City Centre (BBCC), a fully integrated development located at the former site of Pudu Jail, with the project 40% owned by UDA, 40% owned by Eco World Development Group Berhad and 20% owned by EPF.
