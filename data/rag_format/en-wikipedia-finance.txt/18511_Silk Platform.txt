## Products

The Silk Platform is a virtualized data layer that sits between customersâ€™ cloud infrastructure and databases/workloads. The Silk Platform decouples data from the cloud infrastructure, enabling workloads to be moved freely. They can be transferred from one cloud vendor to another, to the private cloud, or to on-premises. Silk's Tier 1 data services include zero-footprint clones, data replication, deduplication, and thin provisioning to minimize the cloud resources being used.

The Silk Platform is built on auto-scalable and symmetric active-active architecture that delivers performance across any workload profile, leveraging cloud native IaaS components. With the Silk Clarity capability, the platform uses machine-learning analytics to optimize resources. Silk Flex makes it possible to orchestrate and automate data management.
