Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes


# Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes



The **Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes** (French: *Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects, DGDDI*), commonly known as *les douanes* (Customs), is the customs service of the French Republic. It is responsible for levying indirect taxes, preventing smuggling, surveilling borders and investigating counterfeit money. The agency acts as a coast guard, border guard, sea rescue organisation, and customs service. In addition, since 1995, the agency has replaced the Border Police units of the National Police in carrying out immigration control at smaller border checkpoints, in particular at maritime borders and regional airports.

The Directorate-general is controlled by the Minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and the Civil Service
(French: *Ministère du Budget, des Comptes publics et de la Fonction publique*) at the Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Employment. It is normally known simply as "*la douane*", individual officers being referred to as "*douaniers*". Officers are routinely armed.


## History

The first French customs service was called the ferme générale ("General Farm") and operated under the monarchy. The ferme générale was a private company which bought each year the right to collect taxes. After the French Revolution, the General Farm was dismantled and the French Customs, as a State service created. Shortly after the instauration of Empire, the Customs gained a military status. Some personnels were affected in *bureaux* (port or office-based staff who were tasked to apply customs measures to the goods entering and leaving France), others in *brigades* (mobile detachments organized and equipped to patrol the borders and arrest smugglers).

During French wars, notably the Franco-Prussian War and the First World War, the brigades were used to form marksmen units and to track enemy units trying to infiltrate French lines. During WW1, due to their knowledge of the areas and their experience in human tracking, they were part of *Corps Francs* (small units which were tasked to operate behind German lines to collect intelligence and perform sabotages on enemy targets). The red stripe on their uniforms is a remaining of the decoration of one of their officers, *Capitaine Cutsaert* during the Napoleonic wars

The military customs service fought in the early part of the Second World War but was disbanded on June 22, 1940 after the French defeat and was never reconstituted as a military service. The most plausible reason was the downsizing of the French Military due to the 1940 armistice Nonetheless small units of customs men from customs posts in French Indochina fought against the Japanese as guerilla units until the end of the war.

The Musée national des douanes located in Bordeaux, France, presents the history of French customs.


## Jurisdiction

France has land borders with other members of the European Union Customs Union Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, Monaco and Spain.
European Union laws prohibit systematic customs checks at any border between two members of its Customs Union. So, there are no permanent customs facilities at the borders with these countries. However, France has borders with non members of this Union : Switzerland, Andorra, Brazil and Suriname. At these borders are located customs facilities.
Moreover, there are many facilities inland. French Customs are allowed to search vehicles, merchandises and individuals anywhere France according to the French Customs Code, article 60.

## Legal Framework

Unlike the French National Police, Municipal Polices and the French Gendarmerie, most customs officers do not gain their powers from the *Code de Procédure Pénale* (Code Of Criminal Procedure) but from the *Code des Douanes National* (*National Customs Code*).
They can :

* search vehicles of any kind, merchandises, people, artificial islands, installations and constructions of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone, commercial buildings and habitations;
* perform drug tests on individuals;
* order a driver to stop, and if he does not comply use all necessary means to immobilize him;
* divert a ship to a French port;
* seize documents and merchandises;
* consult files of many administrations and nearly all companies which move goods or accomplish customs operations;
* open boxes send by postal service or express fret companies;
* perform identity checks, infiltrate criminal organizations
* investigate both nationally and internationally with foreign customs;
* requisition qualified people;
* take samples;

Some of these operations require prior approval by a magistrate.

However, the personnels of the SNDJ, nicknamed *Officiers de Douane Judiciaire* (**ODJ**), can not use these powers. They gained their powers from the Code of Criminal Procedure
