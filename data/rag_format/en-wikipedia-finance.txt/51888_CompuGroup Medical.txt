## History

In 1984, Jürgen Riebling, Peter Kirchdorfer, Ursula Spitta, Max-Georg Prahl and Walter Schäfer founded Compudent GmbH, which became a public company in 1986. In 1992, Frank Gotthardt took over all the ordinary shares and merged Compudent with his company "Gotthardt Computer GmbH" in Koblenz, whereby the name "Compudent AG" was retained. Initially, dental information systems were offered, followed by software in 1993. In 1997, the company was renamed Compugroup Holding AG.

In 2004, the company entered the Czech Republic with doctor information systems for registered doctors and dentists. In the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland the company soon entered the field of hospital information systems. The company also developed information systems for physicians in France, Spain and Italy. In Germany, several products were added to the portfolio: medical archiving solutions, hospital information systems, multimedia communication services, drug information systems, laboratory information systems, a referring physician portal and administration software. In addition, web-based patient files were launched and intelligent assistance systems for doctors were developed.

The company expanded its operations in Austria, achieving market leadership in hospital information systems and information systems for doctors in private practice, as well as for acute care, rehabilitation, and social facilities. In Turkey, the company entered the market for doctor, hospital, and health insurance software. Its presence extended to Scandinavia, Africa, and Asia, acquiring customers in the sectors of private medical practice, hospitals, and laboratories. In the United States, the company also initiated activities in doctor information systems and web-based patient records. In the Netherlands, it entered the market for doctor and pharmacy information systems.

In order to realize plans for internationalization, the owner decided in 1997 to change the name from Compudent AG to CompuGroup AG, which was implemented around the turn of the millennium. In 2010, the CompuGroup Holding was renamed CompuGroup Medical and merged with the subsidiaries that had been created in the meantime under this umbrella brand. In 2016, the transition from a stock corporation under German law to a Societas Europaea under European law took place.

In February 2020, CompuGroup Medical announced that it had signed a purchase agreement for part of the IT healthcare portfolio of healthcare software company Cerner in Germany and Spain. The main products of the acquired portfolio are medico and Soarian Integrated Care, leading hospital information systems in Germany, Selene, a leading hospital information system in Spain, and Soarian Health Archive, an archive solution for healthcare facilities.

On 31 December 2020, founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Frank Gotthardt resigned from his position and assumed the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors. Prof. (apl.) Dr. med. Daniel Gotthardt, son of the company founder, has been CEO since September 1, 2024. He has also been a member of the company's Supervisory Board since 2003 and a member of the Board of Directors since 2020.
