Nova Scotia Department of Economic and Rural Development


# Nova Scotia Department of Economic and Rural Development



The **Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism** was a part of the Government of Nova Scotia. It was created in 2011 from the former **Department of Economic and Rural Development.** Its primary purpose was to stimulate the economy of Nova Scotia. The Department did this by helping Nova Scotia businesses to expand employment opportunities, and by encouraging the establishment and growth of commerce and industry in the province. The departmental mandate also included designing economic development policies, programs, and activities that strengthen economic and social conditions in the province. The department was dissolved in April 2015, when it was superseded by the new and smaller Department of Business. Some programs and assignments have also been transferred from the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism to other departments and crown corporations such as the Department of Labour and Advanced Education, Tourism Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotia Business Inc.

The last minister of the department was Michel Samson.
