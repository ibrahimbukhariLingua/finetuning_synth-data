# MCH Group



**MCH Group** is an international live-marketing company based in Basel, Switzerland. MCH Group's core business is staging its own fairs as well as guest events. The international art fair Art Basel is the leading exhibition of MCH Group.


## History

MCH Group has its roots in the "Schweizer Mustermesse", founded in 1916. In 2001, Messe Basel and Messe Zürich merged to “Messe Schweiz”. In 2009, Messe Schweiz was renamed MCH Group AG. In addition, MCH Group also comprises Expomobilia, MCH Global, and MC², as well as other holdings.

Until 2019, MCH Group hosted the annual watch and jewelry show Baselworld, which gathered all the industry players from around the world: manufacturers, buyers, retailers, collectors, media, and enthusiasts. Depending on the source, the demise of this fair is attributed to the profound upheavals of the market and its own management failures. At its peak around 2015, BASELWORLD hosted 1,500 exhibitors from 40 nations on 140,000 square meters and welcomed over 150,000 visitors.
