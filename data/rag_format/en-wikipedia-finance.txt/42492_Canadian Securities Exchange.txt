# Canadian Securities Exchange



**Canadian Securities Exchange** (**CSE**; French: *La Bourse des valeurs canadiennes*), operated by CNSX Inc., is a stock exchange domiciled in Canada. When recognized by the Ontario Securities Commission in 2004, CSE was the first new exchange approved in Ontario in 70 years. The CSE is a rapidly growing stock exchange focused on working with entrepreneurs to access the public capital markets in Canada and internationally. The Exchange's efficient operating model, advanced technology and low fee structure help companies of all sizes minimize their cost of capital and maximize access to liquidity.

The CSE offers investors access to a broad selection of growth companies through a liquid, reliable and regulated trading platform. The Exchange is dedicated to entrepreneurship at all levels and has established itself as a leading hub for discourse in the entrepreneurial community.

Designed to meet the needs of emerging public companies and their investors, CSE has experienced rapid growth over the last five years and lists over 700 securities.

In February 2015, the CSE Composite Index was launched as a broad indicator of market activity for the CSE. The CSE Composite Index is a market capitalization weighted benchmark reflecting the performance of CSE listed securities meeting index eligibility requirements. The Composite Index is uniquely positioned to gauge the Canadian small cap market. Reuters and Bloomberg publish CSE composite index under the ticker CSECOMP. The Index provides a distinctly different risk/return profile compared to the TSX/S&P Composite. The CSE25 Index is a subset of the CSE Composite Index containing the securities of the twenty-five largest Index companies by market capitalization.

The CSE is located in Toronto, Ontario, and maintains a branch office in Vancouver, British Columbia.
