## Reviews

Nandan Nilekani said that in this book the author has "so convincingly argued (that) open policies and rapid economic growth are the best antidotes for poverty reduction."

The review in Foreign Affairs said, "This is a massive research study that will command the respect of scholars who like to pore over tables, graphs, and charts in search of patterns and connections in the data."

Economist Sally Razeen said that by this book, "Arvind Panagariya has written probably the best all-around, up-to-date, and accessible book on the Indian economy."
