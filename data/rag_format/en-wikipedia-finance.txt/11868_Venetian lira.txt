Venetian lira


# Venetian lira



The **lira** (plural *lire*) was the distinct currency of Venice until 1848, when it was replaced by the Italian lira. It originated from the Carolingian monetary system used in much of Western Europe since the 8th century CE, with the *lira* subdivided into 20 *soldi*, each of 12 *denari*.


## History

From its initial value of 305.94 g fine silver, the Venetian lira had depreciated so much in value over its 1,000-year lifetime that this original unit was referred to from 1200 CE as the *lira piccola* (small lira) in comparison to larger units of the same name. The *denaro* or *piccolo* worth 1⁄240 *lira* was the only coin produced between 800–1200nbspCE. Initially weighing 1.7 g fine silver, it was gradually debased over the centuries until it contained only 0.08 g fine silver by 1200 CE.

The Venetian grosso then became Venice's most important silver coin from the 13th to 15th centuries. It contained 2.1 g fine silver and was valued in 1200 CE at 26 *denari piccoli*, increasing to 48 *piccoli* by 1350. The *lira di grossi* was then invented as a monetary unit equal to 240 *grossi* and increasing in value from 26 to 48 *lire piccoli*.

The gold ducat then became an even more popular Venetian coin from the 13th to 19th centuries. Issued in 1284 in imitation of the Florentine florin and containing around 3.5 g fine gold, it was initially valued at 2.4 *lire piccoli* or 18 silver *grossi* (each grosso then worth 32 *piccoli*). By 1472 its value has increased to 6.2 *lire piccoli*.

By 1472 the *lira di grossi* gave way to the *ducat* accounting unit, equal to 1⁄10 the *lira di grossi* or 24 *grossi*, and fixed at 6.2 *lire* or 124 *soldi piccoli*. Confusion then set in the 16th century when the accounting ducat became worth less than the gold ducat, leading to the gold coin being called the *zecchino* (English: sequin) and understood to be worth more than the accounting ducat of 6.2 lire.

The various currency systems of Italy became of less importance to European trade after the Age of Discovery in the 16th century; nonetheless Venice continued to issue new coins. The *scudo d'argento* of 30.1 g fine silver was introduced in 1578 for 7 lire, rising to 12.4 lire by 1739. The *tollero* of 23.4 g fine silver was issued in 1797 for 10 lire.

The Venetian *lira piccola* was supplanted in the 19th century by the Italian lira of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1806 and the Lombardy-Venetian lira of the Austrian Empire. The Italian lira was reintroduced by the Republic of San Marco in 1848 at par with the French franc, which finally replaced all previous currencies as well as the *lira piccola*, with the latter valued at 0.5116 Italian lira.


## Coins

A huge variety of coins were minted under their post-1750 currency system when the *lira piccola* contained 2.4 grams fine silver, with many coins having unique names as follows:

* Copper 1⁄2 soldo (*bezzo*)
* Billon 1 soldo (*marchetto*), 2 soldi (*gazetto*, from which the gazette was named after), 5, 10, 15 soldi and 30 soldi (*lirazza*)
* Silver *Ducatello* or *Ducato Effettivo*: 8 lire (also in fractions of 1⁄2, 1⁄4 & 1⁄8)
* Silver *Ducatone* or *Giustiniano*: 11 lire (also in fractions of 1⁄2, 1⁄4 & 1⁄8)
* Silver *Scudo d'Argento* or *Scudo della Croce*: 12.4 lire (also in fractions of 1⁄2, 1⁄4 & 1⁄8)
* Gold *Zecchino* (or sequin, ducat; also in multiples): 22 lire
* Gold *Doppio* (also called doubloon or pistole): 38 lire.

The provisional government issued silver *tolleros* worth 10 *lire piccoli* in 1797. These were followed during the Austrian occupation by silver 1⁄2, 1, 1+1⁄2 and 2 *lire provinciale* worth much less than the *lira piccola*. Rejection of these coins led to the later issuance of the *lira austriaca* from 1815 to 1848.
