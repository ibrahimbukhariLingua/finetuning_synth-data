# Bertrand Vogt



**Bertrand Othmar Vogt** known bis his initials **B.O. Vogt** (German: [bɛrˈtrænd vɔt]; 1857 - September 23, 1936) was a Swiss industrialist, philanthropist and politician who served on the Grand Council of Aargau from 1909 to 1917 for the Free Democratic Party.


## Early life and education

Vogt was born 1857 in Menziken, Switzerland, the second of six children, to Melchior Vogt (1811–1893), a cotton manufacturer, and Elisabeth (née Heiz; 1830–1910). His siblings were Manfred Linus Vogt (1856–1943), Samuel Eugen Vogt (1862–1943), Gotthilde Alma Vogt (1864–1938), Cäcilie Vogt and Emilie Vogt. Through an illegitimate relationship of his father he had another half-brother, Melchior Vogt Jr. (1838–1912).

His father was a wealthy cotton manufacturer, merchant and military officer. He also served in a variety of public offices on a municipal level. In 1852, he was among the founders and later president of the board of "Bank in Menziken", an original predecessor to Valiant Bank. Vogt completed the schools in Menziken and Reinach before completing a commercial apprenticeship in a banking house.


## Career

Initially, Vogt was employed as signing officer with several companies, before taking up residence in Basel, Switzerland working for E. Staehlin-Simon, a tobacco trading company and money change house, near the central station. After the death of his father-in-law he and his wife returned to Reinach, Aargau where he ultimately became a partner in Hediger Sons, back then the largest manufacturer of tobacco in the region, with an investment of 60,000 Swiss Francs. Since 1904, the company was managed as a corporation, which ultimately was presided by Vogt. Since 1908 he was also a member of the Aargau Natural Research Society and since 1920 he served on the Board of Directors of Bank in Menziken (an original predecessor of Valiant Bank).


## Personal life

Vogt married Emilie Hediger, a daughter of the tobacco manufacturer Johann Rudolf Hediger (1827–1893) who was the proprietor of Hediger Sons (which later merged into Villiger Sons). The couple did not have children.

His estate was turned into the *Vogt Brothers Fund* in 1937 by his younger brother Manfred Linus Vogt (who also died without issue in 1943). In the Swiss Armed Forces, Vogt was a Lieutenant General (1884 until retirement).
