### Government


### Post politics

In March 2015, he became chairman of the board of Sparebank 1 Nord-Norge.

Two months later, in May 2015, he became the CEO of Norwegian Oil and Gas. He stepped down from the position in early January 2020, but remained in place until a successor was appointed. He stated that "everything has an end", and added that he thought it was time for someone new to take over. He was subsequently succeeded by Anniken Hauglie.

In February 2020, he became a partner in the socio-economic analysis company Menon Economics.


### Auditor General of Norway

In November 2021, he was nominated as the next Auditor General of Norway, succeeding retiring Per-Kristian Foss. He assumed office on 1 January 2022.

Upon assuming office, Schjøtt-Pedersen took over the investigation into members of Parliament's economic schemes. He called it "an important mission" and called the trust in elected officials "determining for the whole democratic system". He went on to say: "It is unusual for a Office of the Auditor General to generally be commissioned to review matters of such significance to the elected representatives. It is also unusual for the Storting to impose such a review. The Office of the Auditor General does not usually go into individual cases, but we will do so now".

In October, he presented a report into the Norwegian Army's information systems which determined that there were numerous vulnerabilities. Schjøtt-Pedersen also stated that the findings pinpoints serious concerns and consequences for national security.

In December, he presented a report looking into the authorities control over waste which is exported from Norway. The report concludes that Norwegian authorities' handling of the issue is critic worthy, parts of the exporting is illegal and that control over waste is lacking.

In April 2023, he presented another report into MPs economic schemes. The report determined that 61 MPs had not complied with the disclosure obligation - i.e. the rule that they must inform about other income while they are paid from the Storting so that this can be deducted. This also implies that they received to much severance pay.


## Personal life

He is married to Grete Lorck, whom he met in Oslo in 1986. Together they have three children.
