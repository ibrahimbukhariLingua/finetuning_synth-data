In 1897, the company that would become Encompass began selling personal insurance under the motto "Protection and Security." The company’s package policy dates back to then.

In 1999, Illinois-based Allstate Insurance Company purchased the personal lines insurance business from CNA Financial when CNA moved toward commercial lines. Allstate then introduced the Encompass name to its subsidiary in 2000.

Encompass distributes its products through 6,500 independent agency locations in 42 states.

Encompass was the title sponsor of the Encompass Championship Tour celebrity pro-am golf tournament in Tampa, Florida, in February 2012, and in Glenview, Illinois, from 2013-2015.

The Encompass Championship selected three other youth-serving organizations as charity partners that year as well: Daniel Murphy Scholarship Fund, Junior Achievement of Chicago and JDRF.
