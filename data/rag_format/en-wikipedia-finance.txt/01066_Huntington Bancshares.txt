## History

P. W. Huntington formed P. W. Huntington & Company in 1866, operating on the northwest corner of High and Broad Streets; the site now houses the regional headquarters for rival U.S. Bancorp. Huntington built its first five-story building in 1878, on the intersection's southwest corner. Four of P. W.'s five sons became partners during the 1890s and early 1900s. The bank was incorporated in 1905 as The Huntington National Bank of Columbus. Huntington died in 1918 shortly after turning the bank over to his sons.

Francis Huntington became president and provided active leadership for 14 years. In 1915, the bank received limited trust powers. In 1922, it received full trust powers from the Federal Reserve System. In 1923, Huntington purchased Columbus-based State Savings Bank & Trust Company and the Hayden-Clinton National Bank of Columbus, swelling its capital base.

In 1958, Huntington acquired the Columbus-based The Market Exchange Bank Company. In 1962, it acquired both First National Bank of Grove City and The People's Bank of Canal Winchester.
