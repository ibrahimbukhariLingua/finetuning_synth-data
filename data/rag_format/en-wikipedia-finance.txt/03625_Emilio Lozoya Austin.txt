In 2017, he was immersed in the Odebrecht bribery scandal that hit politicians and ministers across Latin America. In particular, a direct accusation of alleged bribery payments of more than 10 million dollars between 2010 and 2014 was made against Emilio Lozoya by Luis Alberto de Meneses Weyll, director of Odebrecht in México at the time of the alleged bribes. He categorically denies all claims.


### Corruption

In July 2019, Lozoya was accused of taking $10M (£8m) in bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht which has admitted having paid off politicians in Latin America. Lozoya's wife, sister, and mother are implicated in the same corruption case. For the second time, in July 2019, a judge ordered the detention of Lozoya Austin, in relation to the Odebrecht scandal. Lozoya was detained by Spanish police in Málaga, Spain in February 2020 and extradited to Mexico on July 17, 2020.

Upon his return to Mexico, Lozoya was hospitalized for anemia and problems with his esophagus; later, he had surgery for a hiatal hernia. On July 21, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that Lozoya would be given witness protection because his testimony could help "clean" Mexico of corruption, and that he (AMLO) would support a sentence reduction if Lozoya's testimony proved useful. The president said, *Nosotros queremos recuperar el dinero* ("We want to recuperate the money") and pointed out that US$200 million was involved in the sale of a fertilizer plant. According to the newspaper *Reforma,* Lozoya Austin has testified to bribes amounting to MXN $52,380,000 given to legislators and members of National Action Party (Mexico) (PAN), including Ricardo Anaya, Ernesto Cordero Arroyo, Salvador Vega Casillas, Francisco Domínguez Servién, Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca and Jorge Luis Lavalle Maury. The bribes were allegedly orchestrated by Luis Videgaray in 2013 and 2014 in exchange for support of energy reform legislation. Anaya and PAN deny the accusations.

*Reforma* says that Brazilian businessman Luis Alberto Meneses Weyll paid Lozoya US $10 million for Peña Nieto's presidential campaign on behalf of Odebrecht in a transaction that took place at a bakery in Lomas de Chapultepec, Miguel Hidalgo, Mexico City.
