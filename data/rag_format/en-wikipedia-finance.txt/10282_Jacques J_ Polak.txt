His first professional work was with Professor Jan Tinbergen. In 1938 he began his international service at the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations, where he served until 1943.⁷ He was a member of the Netherlands delegations to the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference establishing the International Monetary Fund and to the Atlantic City conference that established the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). During this period, he served at the Dutch Embassy in Washington. From 1944 to 1946, he was an Assistant Financial Adviser, and then Economic Adviser to the Director General of UNRRA.

He joined the staff of the International Monetary Fund in January 1947, serving first as Chief of the Statistics Division, and then as assistant director, deputy director, and from 1958, as Director, of Research.

After serving briefly as Adviser to the managing director, he was elected in January 1981 as executive director of the Fund for the constituency of Cyprus, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania, and Yugoslavia. He served with distinction as an executive director until 1986 when he retired for a second time.
