**Musikhaus Thomann** is a German-based retailer of musical instruments, studio, lighting, and pro-audio equipment.

According to a 2014 article in the largest Upper Franconian newspaper based in Bavaria, the *Fränkischer Tag* , Musikhaus Thomann is the largest online retailer of its category of merchandise, worldwide. Hans Thomann Sr., founded the company seventy-one years ago (in 1954) as a family business in Treppendorf — part of the village of Burgebrach, in Bavaria, Germany — where the Musikhaus Thomann headquarters endures today (2025). And, as of 2025, the company is still family-owned.
