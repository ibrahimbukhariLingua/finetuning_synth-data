### Gas distribution

In 2009, Lapindo Brantas started to supply households in East Java with natural gas. The project involves supplying 8 million cubic feet per day (230×10~~^~~³ m³/d) of gas to households in surrounding villages of Surabaya.


## Sidoarjo mud flow

The Sidoarjo mud flow is the result of an erupting mud volcano in the subdistrict of Porong, Sidoarjo in East Java, Indonesia that has been in eruption since May 2006. It is the biggest mud volcano in the world; responsibility for it was credited to the blowout of a natural gas well drilled by Lapindo Brantas, although some scientists and company officials contend it was caused by a distant earthquake.

Lapindo Brantas took responsibility in covering the cost of emergency response and victim resettlement, paying more than Rp.5 trillion (approx. US$550 million) despite its acquittal as the cause of the mudflow in 2009 by Indonesia's Supreme Court.
