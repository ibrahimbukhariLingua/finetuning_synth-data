## History

August Troendle founded Medpace in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1992 as *Medical Research Services*. Troendle first became interested in the CRO sector after working in both the regulatory and pharmaceutical area. He began his career as a reviewer with the FDA, specializing in the development of lipid lowering therapies to treat high cholesterol.

With a team of industry physicians, Jonathan Issacsohn and Evan Stein completed many early studies while at Medpace and Medpace Reference Laboratories on the use of statin therapies for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Another Medpace physician, David Orloff was regarded as an industry opinion leader in the study of metabolic diseases – most specifically diabetes and obesity. Troendle was honored for his work as a Medpace founder in 2012 by the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.

Medpace completed construction on a new campus in 2012 in Madisonville, a neighborhood on the eastern side of Cincinnati. The project encompassed revitalizing an urban brownfield site formerly occupied by NuTone, and creating a state of the art LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified campus.

In 2022, Medpace announced a $150 million capital investment to expand its headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, adding an estimated expansion of 1,500 new jobs.
