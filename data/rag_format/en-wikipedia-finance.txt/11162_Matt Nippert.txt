## The 'tax gap' series

Nippert's series of *New Zealand Herald* articles in 2016 revealed that 20 high-profile firms earning revenue in New Zealand paid a surprisingly low level of tax. The series was credited in parliamentary speeches for igniting pressure for corporate tax reform and was excerpted in *A Moral Truth: 150 Years of Investigative Journalism in New Zealand*, edited by James Hollings. Hollings opined that "Nippert is helping cement the role of investigative journalism as a core part of New Zealand public life".
