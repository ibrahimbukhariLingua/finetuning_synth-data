IHS Towers


# IHS Towers



**IHS Towers** is one of the largest independent owners, operators and developers of shared communications infrastructure in the world, with operations across Africa, Latin America and the Middle East. It is the third largest independent multinational tower company in the world.


## Operations

Founded by Sam Darwish in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2001, IHS specializes in building and operating communication infrastructure throughout emerging markets. The company launched colocation services in 2009, and had acquired MTN’s tower portfolios in Côte d’Ivoire, Cameroon, Zambia and Rwanda by 2014.

Following the completion of a sale and leaseback agreement with the mobile network operator Zain in Kuwait, and the acquisition of Cell Site Solutions in February 2020, IHS Towers expanded beyond Africa, operating across three continents. It is one of the world’s fastest growing tower operators, owning and managing over 40,000 towers in 10 countries, including Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia in Africa; Brazil, Colombia in Latin America; and Kuwait in the Middle East.

IHS was listed on the NYSE in October 2021 in what was noted as the largest U.S. listing of a company with an African heritage.

The company operates six business segments: colocation and lease amendments; new sites; inbuilding solutions, or distributed antenna system (DAS); small cell; fiber connectivity; and rural telephony.

In November 2021, IHS expanded its fiber offering and closed its acquisition of a 51% stake in FiberCo Solucoes de Infraestrutura from TIM Brasil. In June 2022, IHS acquired MTN South Africa’s towers.

IHS increased its use of solar energy and hybrid power systems to reduce its overall emissions; by December 2020, over 45% of its African operations had solar power available. In October 2022, IHS published its "Carbon Reduction Roadmap", a strategy for decreasing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by approximately 50% by 2030.

Mobile network operators (MNO)s that IHS works with include: MTN, Orange, Airtel, Etisalat, Millicom, Zain, Claro, TIM, Telefônica and Vivo.

Along with its founding partners, UBC, IHS is supported by a group of international shareholders including Emerging Capital Partners, International Finance Corporation, Wendel, Goldman Sachs, African Infrastructure Investment Managers, Investec, the IFC’s Global Infrastructure Fund, (FMO) Dutch development bank, Korea Investment Corporation, and Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC.

The IHS Board includes Jeb Bush, who heads the governance committee; Ursula Burns, the former Xerox CEO and the first Black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company, who also sits on the Uber and Nestle boards; and Carolina Lacerda, the former head of investments banking of UBS in Brazil.
