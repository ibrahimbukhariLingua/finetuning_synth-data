# Folk2Folk



**FOLK2FOLK** is a Marketplace lending platform (MPL) specializing in secured lending for business owners across the rural and regional parts of the UK. It matches businesses looking for capital with individual (retail) and institutional investors who receive a fixed interest rate from 7.5% p.a. secured against UK land or property. Investors receive the same interest rate that the Borrower pays, with FOLK2FOLK making its profit from an arrangement fee and annual renewal fee charged to Borrowers.

Formed in 2013, FOLK2FOLK is based on the idea that 'good folks' help other 'good folks', FOLK2FOLK enables money to be borrowed and lent based on the concept of 'fair exchange' and secured against land and property. FOLK2FOLK's stated purpose is to create prosperity for Britain's regions. Since 2013, more than half a billion has been invested via the platform with zero investor capital losses.
