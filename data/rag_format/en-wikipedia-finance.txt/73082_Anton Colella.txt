## Early life and education

Anton Colella was raised in Shettleston in a single parent family. He graduated from the University of Stirling.


## Teaching career

Colella spent the first 18 years of his career as a Catholic theology teacher. He served as deputy headmaster at St Margaret Mary's Secondary School in Glasgow from 2000 to 2003.


## Business career

In 2003, Colella became the chief executive of the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA). In October 2006, he became the chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS). This appointment was made despite the fact that Colella did not possess an MBA degree, nor any obvious qualifications apart from his work in Catholic education.

Colella oversaw a globalization phase of ICAS, such that, by 2015, he claimed that their overseas membership had grown by 60 per cent in the previous decade. During this period, Colella also advocated for the simplification of the UK tax code, which he complained of being "12 times the length of the Bible". Colella departed the ICAS in March 2018. At his resignation, the ICAS president Brian Souter said, "Over the past decade, Anton has been the architect of a transformed ICAS".

Colella became the CEO of Moore Global in March 2018. Colella oversaw the rebranding of the company from Moore Stephens to Moore Global. Colella defended the rebranding as meeting "a world defined by global decision-making, data-driven insight and the need for agility."


## Affiliations

In 2011, Colella became a chair of the Global Accounting Alliance.

Colella serves on the International Executive Council of the Sword of the Spirit, an association of Christian communities belonging to the charismatic movement.
