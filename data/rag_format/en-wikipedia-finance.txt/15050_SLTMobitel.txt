## History

SLT-MOBITEL started its operations in 1858 with the establishment of the first Telegraphic Circuit between Galle and Colombo. In the same year, it established its first international Telegraph Communication between then called Ceylon, and India. Since then, Sri Lanka Telecom passed several milestones, including corporatisation in 1991 and privatizsation in 2000 with the collaboration of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and listing on the Colombo Stock Exchange's Milanka Price Index.

In 2008, NTT sold its stake in SLT to Global Telecommunications Holdings N.V. of Netherlands, which currently owns 44.98% stake in Sri Lanka Telecom whilst 48% is owned by the Government of Sri Lanka and the balance shares remain with the general public.

Mobitel was incorporated in 1993 as the third mobile telephone provider in the Sri Lankan market. Originally a collaboration between Sri Lanka Telecom and Telstra, Mobitel has been wholly owned by SLT since November 2002.

In January 2004, the company launched its fully-fledged 2.5G GSM network that is EDGE/GPRS enabled and designed to operate on the dual-band. In 2005 and 2006, Mobitel traded the 800 MHz band for slots made available from the 900 MHz spectrum. With this enhancement, Mobitel embarked on a field trial of 3G at the 1st International Buddhist Conference held in 2006, setting the stage for the launch of its 3G services in Sri Lanka. In December 2007, the company launched its 3.5G HSPA network – the first Super 3.5G network in South Asia. Further, Mobitel successfully demonstrated HSPA + MIMO technology with downlink speed up to 28.8 Mbit/s and carried out a successful trial of 4G/LTE technology with downlink speed exceeding 96 Mbit/s, for the first time in the South Asian Region. Investments committed to date in the 2.5G/3.5G/4G networks and service offering amounts to over US$500mn.

Investments committed to a date for this technology to provide 3G and GSM totals over US$200 million. This included increasing the present number of base stations from 600 to 1,500 by the end of 2008.
