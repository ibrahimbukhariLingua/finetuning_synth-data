# Central Bank of Eswatini



The **Central Bank of Eswatini** (Swazi: *Umntsholi Wemaswati*), is the central bank of Eswatini. It was established in April 1974 and is based in capital Mbabane. According to the bank's website, the bank's mission is to promote monetary stability and foster a stable and sound financial system.
Among the bank's responsibilities are managing Eswatini's foreign exchange position and safeguarding the country's foreign reserves of cash. The bank conducts weekly auctions of 91-day Swazi treasury bills, through "primary dealer" Swazi banks. The current governor is Dr. Phil Mnisi.
