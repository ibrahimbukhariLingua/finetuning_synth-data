## Copyright lawsuits

In 2011, in a dispute over a licensing agreement, the band brought a copyright infringement lawsuit against Lakewood Church and Joel and Victoria Osteen for $3 million for alleged unauthorized use of their song "Signaling Through the Flames" on DVDs and television broadcasts. The case was dismissed.

In 2016, the band sued Google, Tidal and Microsoft for alleged infringement relating to the payment of streaming royalties, with Microsoft settling out of court. In response to the band's claims that they are owed $5 million, a Tidal spokesperson claimed "They are misinformed as to who, if anyone, owes royalty payments to them".
