Quicksilver initiatives


# Quicksilver initiatives



**Quicksilver Initiatives** is a term coined by the Bush administration in *The President's Management Agenda* between the years 2001 and 2002. President Bush's agenda was characterized by its presenting of fourteen different "areas of improvement" in federal government. The fourth of those areas was labeled "Expanded Electronic Government" and it was with regards to President Bush administration's intended transformation in e-governance. The quicksilver initiatives "marked the beginning of the era of full-scale e-government at the federal level."

President Bush presented the quicksilver initiatives as a strategy to reach his administration's goal of providing a larger number of services to a greater number of people at lower costs via electronic means. This process of transformation sought to shift the attention of governmental information technology from providing services within and among agencies to providing services to the public. It is, making "networks rather than agencies become primary" as it relates to public services.

As a first step, the Clinton administration's concept of e-government was adopted by President Bush's government. It re-recreated, developed and implemented the existing FirstGov initiative along with a group of other twenty four projects that constitute the now so-called quicksilver initiatives.
