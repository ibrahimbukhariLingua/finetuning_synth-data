Evil corporation


# Evil corporation



An **evil** **corporation** ignores social responsibility, morality, ethics, and sometimes laws in order to make profit for its shareholders. In rare cases, the corporation may be well intentioned but extremist, engaging in noble cause corruption.


## In fiction

The notion is "deeply embedded in the landscape of contemporary cultureâ€”populating films, novels, videogames, and more." The science fiction genre served as the initial background to portray corporations in this dystopian light.

Evil corporations can be seen to represent the danger of combining capitalism with larger hubris.

Some notable uses of the trope include Arasaka Corporation in the *Cyberpunk* franchise, Atlas Corporation in *Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare*, Weyland-Yutani in the *Alien* franchise, InGen in the *Jurassic Park* franchise, Resources Development Administration (RDA) in the *Avatar* franchise, Umbrella Corporation in *Resident Evil*, and E-Corp in *Mr. Robot*.


## Real-world usage

Some real-world corporations have been accused of being evil. To guard against such accusations, Google used the official motto "Don't be evil" until the formation of Alphabet Inc. Rob Enderle argued that this motto was never truly followed, and critics of Google have accused the company of "evil" acts such as secret data collection, violating customers' privacy, and political bias. The motto was eventually moved to the very end of its code of conduct. *The New Yorker* wrote that "many food activists consider Monsanto (which later merged with Bayer) to be *the* definitively evil corporation".

*The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility* wrote, "For many consumers, Walmart serves as the evil corporation prototype, but record numbers shop at the stores for low prices."

In Japan, a committee of journalists and rights activists issues an annual "corporate raspberry award" known as Most Evil Corporation of the Year Award (also called the Black Company Award) to a company "with a culture of overwork, discrimination and harassment".

After the shooting of Brian Thompson in December 2024, many Americans used social media to express their outrage against health insurance companies and the American healthcare system overall, often using terms associated with the trope to describe these corporations.
