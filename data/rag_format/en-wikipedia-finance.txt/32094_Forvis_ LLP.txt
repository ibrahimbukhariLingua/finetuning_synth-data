### Baird, Kurtz & Dobson

In 1922, three men—William Baird, Wade Kurtz and Claire Dobson—decided to start their own firm with offices in Kansas City and Joplin, Missouri, after the disbandment of the Montgomery Firm, where the three had been employed. On January 2, 1923, the men took the $1,700 they had in the bank and opened their business: Baird, Kurtz & Dobson.

Initially, the firm looked to expand to St. Louis and Chicago, but the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression curtailed growth, forcing the firm to build its clientele and reputation in Kansas City and Joplin.

After World War II, a growth period began. A third office opened in Springfield, Missouri, in July 1948, and a uranium boom led the firm to purchase a tax practice in Grand Junction, Colorado.

The 1960s represented a period of significant change. In 1964, the firm drafted its formal partnership agreement, which still exists today. The passage of the Medicare Act in 1965 led the firm to focus on growing its health care practice, which today constitutes the firm's largest industry focus.

Expansion continued throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with the firm opening new offices in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Texas, Nebraska and Kentucky.

Since that time, steady growth has continued. The firm created its first wholly owned subsidiary, BKD Corporate Finance, LLC, in 1994 (rebranded to BKD Capital Advisors in 2019) and passed the $100 million revenue mark in 1999. The firm created its charitable arm, the BKD Foundation, in 1999; since making its first charitable gift in February 2000, the foundation has given more than $14 million to qualifying 501(c)(3) organization. In recent years, BKD has been known to play an active role in the charities "Fighting Hunger... Feeding Hope." and the Ronald McDonald House.

The firm undertook its second largest merger in 2001, combining with Olive LLP to create BKD, LLP, which was the eighth-largest U.S. accounting firm at the time. That year also marked a name change for BKD Investment Advisors, founded in 1998, to BKD Wealth Advisors, LLC.

On October 1, 2013 BKD officially acquired Malin Bergquist & Co, LLP, a firm that was previously based in Erie, Pennsylvania.

As of November 1, 2014, Wolf & Company officially became a part of BKD through the result of a merger.

In 2015, BKD launched women's initiatives, sales training that spanned the entire firm, and a national enterprise risk solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ practice.

In 2016, the firm claimed 41 offices in 19 states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah, making it one of the largest accounting firms in the United States.


## Initiatives

**FORVIS Foundation** — The FORVIS Foundation was the firm's charitable arm. It aimed to enrich the communities FORVIS serves through financial donations and volunteerism. The foundation supported not-for-profit organizations of many types and sizes, including several FORVIS clients and organizations, with firm partners and employees serving in volunteer roles. The FORVIS Foundation made its first donation in 2000 and has contributed more than $14 million to date.

**SKY Initiative** — SKY was a firmwide BKD initiative to emphasize and strengthen diversity that initially focused on attracting, retaining and developing women leaders in the firm. The goal of SKY was to identify and remove cultural barriers and biases that prevent employees from realizing their potential.
