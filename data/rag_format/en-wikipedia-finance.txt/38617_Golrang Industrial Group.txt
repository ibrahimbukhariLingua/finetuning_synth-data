Over the years, Pakshoo grew to become one of Iran's largest manufacturers of cleaning products. In 1991, Mehdi Fazli joined Pakshoo, and under his leadership, the company expanded its production. In 1995, new products such as shampoos and liquid hand soaps were added to the Golrang lineup. By 1999, GolPakhsh Aval was established to manage the marketing, sales, and distribution of Pakshoo’s products.
