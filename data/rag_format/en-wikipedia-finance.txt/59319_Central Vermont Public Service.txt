## History

In 1929, the company was founded by combining eight Vermont electric companies. The creator was Samuel Insull. The company was among the first companies to successfully use wind to generate electricity and organized Yankee Atomic Electric Company to make a trial in atomic power.

In 1990s and 2000s, CVPS struggled to maintain profitability and was acquired by Quebec's Gaz Métro on June 27, 2012, merging into its Green Mountain Power subsidiary through Gaz Métro's American operations, Northern New England Energy Corporation. Gaz Métro purchased CVPS for $472 million, outbidding another Canadian company who sought CVPS, Fortis Inc.
