Black Market International


# Black Market International



**Black Market International (BMI)** is a performance artist collective with international members, each with an established and independent practice as a solo performer. Since 1985 the group has presented durational collective performances worldwide.

The movement was founded under the name *Market project* in 1985 in Poznan (Poland) with founders Boris Nieslony, Zygmunt Piotrowski, Tomas Ruller and Jürgen Fritz. In 1986 for the first European tour the name *Black Market* was taken. In 1990/91 the group appeared as *Black Market International*, with personal changes .

There have been a variety of different versions of what BMI is about, as the group always avoided the definition of an organised group. The title Black Market does not designate a group, but rather an idea of working. The aim is to promote - like in a black market - open and free exchange of ideas, and to achieve an *Art of Encounter*, or mixed englisch-german “Art of Begegnung”.
