## Career

While in college, Nuti worked for IBM, selling copiers. Following his graduation in 1986, Nuti accepted a full-time position with IBM, selling telephone systems for an entity IBM had recently acquired. In 1988, Nuti left IBM for a start-up company, Network Equipment Technology, which was based in San Jose, California. In 1990, he joined Netrix as a regional manager. One of the company's customers was Cisco, which hired Nuti in 1991.

In 1997, Nuti moved to Singapore and ran Cisco in the Asia/Pacific region. In 1999, he moved to London and ran Cisco Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and more than doubled Cisco's revenue in the region. In 2001, he returned to Cisco's headquarters and became senior vice president responsible for both the company's Worldwide Service Provider business and the U.S. Theater Operations. In this dual role, he led Cisco's field operations, systems engineering, professional services, marketing and U.S. sales divisions.

### NCR Corporation

When Nuti joined NCR in 2005 its compound annual growth rate over the eight years following the spinoff was less than 1 percent.

Nuti spent 2006-10 restructuring the company's entire supply chain. In January 2007, NCR announced a spinoff of Teradata, the company's data-warehousing business, which was completed on October 1, 2007. In 2009, NCR announced that its headquarters would move from Dayton, Ohio to Atlanta, Georgia. Nuti explained the decision in a 2012 interview: “The decision was good for the company long term, but we made it with a heavy heart.”

In 2011, NCR started making investments in developing the company vision. NCR made a number of acquisitions including Radiant in 2011, Retalix in 2013, and Digital Insight in 2014.

In November 2015, NCR announced a strategic partnership with Blackstone, which NCR said would accelerate its “ongoing strategic transformation into an integrated software and services company.” The agreement called for affiliates of Blackstone to invest $820 million in NCR in the form of perpetual convertible preferred shares. NCR used the Blackstone investment to help fund a share repurchase through a self-tender offer for $1 billion of its common stock.

As of 2016, NCR had $1.8 billion in software revenue and $600 million in cloud revenue, up from zero as recently as 2010. Its non-GAAP operating income increased from $383 million in 2010 to $840 million in 2016.

On March 22, 2018, Nuti announced he was stepping down from the position of NCR's CEO for health reasons.
