The ECN is registered in the European Commission’s voluntary Register that was set up in the context of the European Transparency Initiative.

The ECN is a member of the European Federation of Financial Advisers and Financial Intermediaries (FECIF).


## Lobbying

On October 18th, the ECN lobbied for changes to the proposed central crowdfunding legislation, in Brussels at the 7th ECN Crowdfunding Convention: Defining the future of European Crowdfunding Service Providers.

Various panels discussed key topics in the proposed legislation, for example, the panel discussion “AN ADEQUATE THRESHOLD FOR OFFERINGS PER 12 MONTHS” was facilitated by ECN members rebuildingsociety.com, Invesdor, aescuvest and Privanet. The event was attended by various members of the European Parliament as well as the European Commission. The panel successfully communicated the merits of a significantly higher threshold, combined with clear risk warnings and industry standardised definitions. The panel successfully influenced the European Parliament, who increased the threshold from €1m to €8m and voted in favour of adoption.

Following the work of ECN and the resulting proposal and adaptation of a European harmonised law for crowdfunding (European Crowdfunding Service Provider Regulation) by the European Legislator, the network has continued its discourse between the European institutions and the crowdfunding sector, aiming at streamlining information exchange regarding national implementation of the new law, for example during its 10th ECN Crowdfunding Convention.
