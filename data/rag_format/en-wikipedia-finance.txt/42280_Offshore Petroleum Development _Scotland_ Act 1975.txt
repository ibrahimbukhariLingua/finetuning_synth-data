Offshore Petroleum Development (Scotland) Act 1975


# Offshore Petroleum Development (Scotland) Act 1975



The **Offshore Petroleum Development (Scotland) Act 1975** (c. 8) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which facilitated the onshore construction of offshore oil platforms for the UK Continental Shelf. Its provisions permitted the acquisition of land; the regulation of sea-based operations; the granting of licences for construction; the reinstatement of land; and financial provisions.


## Background

In 1975 the UK government recognised that the development of offshore oil resources would make an important contribution to the UK economy, particularly at a time when the cost of imported crude oil was increasing rapidly. An immediate objective for the government and the oil industry was the building of offshore oil platforms; their construction required significant areas of coastal land. The 1975 Act addressed these issues; it had three purposes: to ensure that land was available for onshore construction; to ensure that construction was properly regulated; and that land was restored after use.

These purposes were enacted by the 1975 Act in detail as follows. Sections 1 and 2 and Schedules 1 and 2 of the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Scotland to acquire any land in Scotland for the purpose of platform construction. Sections 3 to 7 and Schedule 3 allowed the control and regulation of sea-based operations. The Secretary of State was empowered to make Sea Designation Orders and to grant licences for operations. Sections 8 and 9 required the reinstatement of land after construction activities, and provided planning authorities with powers to require a developer to reinstate land. Section 10 empowered the Secretary of State to carry out works on land for construction purposes or to contribute to their cost. Section 11 enabled the Secretary of State to make loans, or to guarantee the repayment of loans, to assist with construction operations. Section 12 enabled an acquisition order to be made in relation to any land, even land which was held "inalienably". The other substantive Sections of the Act included provisions for compensation for nuisance; to require information about land to be made available; and the rights of entry; and financial provisions.

The Government regarded the 1975 Act as a significant part of its oil strategy. The oil field developments encompassed by this legislation were crucial to the UK economy but had significant local social and environmental implications. The Act allowed developments to proceed with appropriate controls and safeguards.
