Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited


# Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited



**Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited** (FCIL) is a public sector undertaking in India under the ownership of Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Government of India.


## Formation of FCIL

The first state-owned fertilizer unit was setup in 1951 at Sindri followed by units in Nangal and Trombay. FCIL was then incorporated in 1961 by the Government of India consolidating several public sector fertilizer units into a single undertaking.


## Reorganization

In 1978, FCIL was reorganized and following new entities were formed – Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Limited (HFCL), Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF) and Projects and Development India Limited (PDIL).

As part of reorganization, Nangal plant was transferred to NFL, Trombay plant was transferred to RCF while Namrup, Haldia, Barauni and Durgapur plants was transferred to HFCL. Namrup plant was later transferred to Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizer Corporation Limited (BVFCL). Production units in Gorakhpur, Sindri, Talcher and Ramagundam along with the proposed unit at Korba were retained with FCIL.


## Closure of Production Units

In November 1992, FCIL along with HFCL was referred to BIFR and was declared sick under The Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985. The production units of FCIL were completely shutdown in between 1990 and 2002 by the Government of India as they were incurring heavy losses. Jodhpur Mining Organization which was also a part of FCIL was hived-off into FAGMIL. The main reasons for the loss incurred by FCIL were higher incidence of interest, higher input costs especially the power tariffs by the respective state electricity boards and the associated raw materials, and higher consumption which was not reimbursed by the FCIL. The main products of FCIL were Ammonia, Urea, Nitric acid, Ammonium bicarbonate, Gypsum, and Ammonium nitrate in varied forms such as Prill, Flake, and Melt.


## Revival of Production Units

In the year 2007, due to shortage of domestic production of Urea leading to higher imports and import costs from other countries, the Government of India decided to revive all the production units of FCIL and HCF to meet the overall domestic demand of Urea. The closed units had huge infrastructure facilities like sizable land bank, residential quarters, office buildings, railway siding, tied up sources of electricity and water which also led to the decision of revival. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave in principle approval to examine the feasibility of reviving units of FCIL and HFCL subject to confirmed availability of gas.

In October 2008, CCEA accorded approval to revive FCIL and HFCL units subject to non-recourse to government funding and to consider write-off of government loan & interest to the extent required subject to submission of fully tied up proposal for final decision on waiver.

In November 2008, Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECOS) was constituted to evaluate all options of revival of closed units and to decide upon the action to be pursued for seeking investments towards revival of each of the unit & recommend to the Government for approval. The ECOS after detailed deliberations recommended that the revival of these closed units would be through ‘nomination route’ by Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and through ‘bidding route’ by private sector.

In August 2011, Government of India decided inter alia awarding individual units to selected parties on a concession basis based on the revival model recommended by ECOS. Talcher and Ramagundam unites were to be revived by PSUs through ‘nomination route' while Sindri, Gorakhpur and Korba Units through ‘bidding route’.

In May 2013, CCEA approved the proposal regarding revival of five closed units of FCIL which included approval of Rs.10,644 crore loan and interest wavier and inter corporate loan of Rs.171 crore.

In June 2013, the Company was deregistered from BIFR, after its net worth became positive in the financial year 2012-13.
