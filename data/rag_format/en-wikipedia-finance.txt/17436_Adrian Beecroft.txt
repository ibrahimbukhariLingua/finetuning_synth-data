## Beecroft Report and controversy

On 21 May 2012, the Beecroft Report caused considerable controversy in the UK due to its recommendations to relax regulation surrounding the dismissal of employees. The report claimed this would help to boost the economy. It was alleged that significant sections of the report had been doctored. It was also reported that some recommendations had been removed from the original draft of the report. On 21 May, Secretary of State for Business Vince Cable condemned the report, saying it was unnecessary for the government to scare workers. Beecroft responded by accusing Cable of being a socialist. He referenced his own experience of having to pay £150,000 for unfairly dismissing an HR employee as one of the many reasons behind the recommendation in the report.


## Philanthropy

Beecroft helped to found and funds the Beecroft Institute of Particle Physics and Cosmology (BIPAC) at Oxford University. He has also part-funded the Beecroft Building, part of the Department of Physics in Oxford. This new building is specifically focused on theoretical, condensed matter and quantum physics. According to *The Daily Telegraph*, the funding for this building was inspired by Beecroft's interest in astrophysics.

Beecroft has supported his school, Hymers College in Hull. He has also been a Trustee of Impetus Trust, a social impact charity. For six years, Beecroft was also the Chairman of the Cricket Foundation, now known as Chance to Shine, a charity focused on bringing cricket back into British state school education.

Through the Beecroft Trust, Adrian and his wife sponsor the Oxford Academy, an Academy school serving a very deprived area of Oxford. Since becoming an Academy school in 2010, its results have improved dramatically from 14% of the students achieving five A\* to C grades including English and Maths to 56% achieving this in 2017. However, in 2019, only 17% of pupils achieved grade 5 or above at GCSE and the school had the worst Attainment 8 and Progress 8 scores of any mainstream school in Oxfordshire. In December 2019, the Head and governing body were removed after an OFSTED inspection.

Beecroft has also supported the UNESCO initiative to preserve the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, which was classified as in danger on the UNESCO List of World Heritage in Danger in 2009.
