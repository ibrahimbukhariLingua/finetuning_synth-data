The **Australian one-pound note** was the most prevalent banknote in circulation with the pound series, with the last series of 1953–66 having 1,066 million banknotes printed.

Upon decimalisation in 1966, it was worth two dollars.


## Historic £1 note

In May 2015, the National Library of Australia announced that it had discovered the first £1 banknote printed by the Commonwealth of Australia, among a collection of specimen banknotes. This uncirculated Australian Pound (£1) note, with the serial number (red-ink) P000001, was the first piece of currency to carry the Coat of Arms of Australia, and carries the imprinted signatures of George Allen (Secretary of the Treasury; 1 January 1901 – 13 March 1916) and James Collins (Assistant Secretary, later Secretary; 14 March 1916 – 26 June 1926). Soon after its production in 1913, it was presented to the then Prime Minister, Andrew Fisher, who retained it until 1927 when he gave it to then prime minister Stanley Bruce for donation to the Parliamentary Library. At that time, the National Library was part of the Parliamentary Library. There is a contemporaneous record in the National Archives of the accession of the note into the national collection. The curator of the collection said that the note had been placed it into a conservation sleeve sometime in the past 30 years, and that notes with similar rarity and provenance and age to this note, have been sold for over A$1m.
