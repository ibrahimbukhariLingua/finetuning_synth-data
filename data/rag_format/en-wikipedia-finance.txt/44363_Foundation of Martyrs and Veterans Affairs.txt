Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs


# Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs



The **Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs** (Persian: بنیاد شهید و امور ایثارگران *Bonyad Shahid va Omur-e Ithargaran*) is an Iranian foundation that receives its funding directly from the national budget. Saeed Ohadi is the current director of the organization. The Foundation gives home loans to disabled veterans and to the families of soldiers killed in acton, who in Iran are considered martyrs (shaheedan). It has reportedly loaned 120 million rials to urban families and 150 million rials to rural families. The Foundation is also involved in numerous economic endeavors, much like the Mostazafen Foundation of Islamic Revolution.


## Economic activity

The Foundations economic activity includes participation in a joint venture with the Industrial Development and Renovation Organization and Iran Electronics Industries' Defense Ministry subsidiary, the Iran Electronic Development Company. In March 2004, this company was part of a consortium that won a mobile-phone license from the Iranian government, but the deal fell through because of political objections.
