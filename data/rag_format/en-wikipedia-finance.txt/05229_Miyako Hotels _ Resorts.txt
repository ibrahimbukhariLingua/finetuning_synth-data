# Miyako Hotels & Resorts



**Miyako Hotels and Resorts** (都ホテルズ&リゾーツ) is a chain of hotels headquartered in Tennōji-ku, Osaka, Japan. It is a subsidiary of Kintetsu Group Holdings. As of today, it has 21 properties (opened or announced), including 19 in Japan, 2 in the United States.


## History

Miyako Hotels began life in 1890, as a tea house and Japanese-style garden in Kyoto, which was built by a wealthy merchant named Nihei Nishimura. Nishimura then opened the first Miyako Hotel ten years later in 1900.

In July 1998, Kintetsu Hotel Systems was established as a hotel management company.

In March 2000, a merger with the Kintetsu Hotel Systems resulted in Miyako Hotels taking over the management of the 1890-vintage hotel in Kyoto, which was rebranded as "The Westin Miyako Kyoto".

In April 2007, Starwood acquired the operating rights of the hotels in Osaka and Tokyo.

In March 2014, Miyako Hotels opened Osaka Marriot Miyako hotel in partnership with Marriott Hotels & Resorts.

On April 1, 2015, Kintetsu Corporation, the parent company of Miyako Hotels, was restructured into a holding company, splitting its railway, real estate, logistics and retail, and recreation service divisions. Miyako Hotels also changed the legal name to Kintetsu Miyako Hotels Co., Ltd. on the same day.


## Brands

In August 2018, the company announced its new brands and logos. These brands divided into three categories, Miyako Hotels, Miyako City (Hotels) and Miyako Resorts which will take place on April 1, 2019.
