## Career

In 1997, Murphy left his job to concentrate on the redevelopment and renewal of his home parish of Churchtown in North County Cork, where he bought a derelict premises, which he restored and opened as a holiday hostel and bar, calling it 'Boss Murphy's'. The restored pub was named after his great grandfather, William 'Boss' Murphy who had founded Churchtown Creamery with other farmers in the parish in 1889. He sold Boss Murphy's in 2004. In 2005 he founded Great Gas Petroleum with seed capital of €3,749 to improve petrol wholesale prices as he felt that the Irish forecourts were paying too much to existing wholesalers.

With a business partner, Maurice Gilbert, he founded Ballyhoura Apple Farm in 2006. Murphy sold Great Gas in 2009 to DCC Energy.

He was the Executive Producer of Bloom - a feature film released in 2004 based on the novel *Ulysses* by James Joyce.
