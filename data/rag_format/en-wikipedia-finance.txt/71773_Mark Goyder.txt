## Royal Society of Arts

Goyder spent 15 years in the manufacturing industry and found himself wondering what really motivated people to come to work. In April 1990 he was given the opportunity to pursue this line of inquiry on a professional basis after being persuaded by Charles Handy to become a program director at the Royal Society of Arts . In 1993 he initiated a business-led inquiry into the role of business in a changing world along with 25 business leaders with the objective to develop a shared vision of the company of tomorrow. The findings were published in 1995 as the Tomorrow's Company Inquiry. The Inquiry laid the foundations for the enlightened shareholder value approach which would eventually redefine directors' duties in the 2006 Companies Act. The following year Goyder left his position at the RSA and founded Tomorrow's Company. He became the CEO, a role he has held to this day.
