## Activities

In 2001, Evelin Int-Lambot, a spouse of Toomas Hendrik Ilves at the time, was hired as project lead in EAS but after working there 4 months, she did not have an idea what was her job in EAS.

In 2002, EAS launched brand "Welcome to Estonia!". The idea behind this was carried forward by the notion that Estonia has changed a lot since the reestablishing independence and the change and success should be advertised more in the world. The brand was ordered from Interbrand Newell and Sorrell Ltd and the coordinator and project manager on the Estonian side was Evelin Int-Lambot. Development took 2 years, from 2000 to 2002, and did cost 13,3 EEK.
Brand was mainly used on info-materials meant for tourists. Part of the brand "Positively transforming" posters were used in Tallinn but this was later cancelled due to the fact that Estonia became one of the top 5 countries in Europe with HIV spread and the positive transformation gained another meaning. Project manager Evelin Int-Lambot did quit her job in December 2002
The project was deemed failure afterwards by a scientific study in 2005 and 13 years later launching it, in 2015, EAS acknowledged that the brand may belong to the dustbin and new one should be developed for the Estonian 100th Anniversary
