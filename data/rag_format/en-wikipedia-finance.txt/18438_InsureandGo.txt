# InsureandGo



**InsureandGo** (officially known as *Insure & Go Insurance Services Limited*) is a British travel insurance company that has been owned by NSM Insurance Group since 2024. In addition to the United Kingdom, it also has operations in the Republic of Ireland and Australia.


## History

InsureandGo was founded in 2000 in Braintree, Essex, United Kingdom, where they were based for the next six years.

In November 2005, InsureandGo claimed to be one of the first companies to remove the terrorism exclusion clause from their policies. The firm also said that they had led the travel insurance market in doing this and urged other companies to do the same.

Due to the company's expansion, InsureandGo relocated to new offices in Southend-on-Sea in 2006. It had bought Southend-based Travel Claims Services in September of the previous year.

In December 2006, InsureandGo hired chartered accountants BDO Stoy Hayward to explore its options, including the possibility of selling the company for a reported £100 million.

After being acquired by Spain's Mapfre for an undisclosed sum in October 2010, it became a subsidiary controlled by one of its companies, Mapfre Asistencia Compañia Internacional de Seguros y Reaseguros Sociedad Anonima. In November 2015, it was announced that InsureandGo would be relocating most of its UK operations to Bristol, including the claims team and finance department.

In September 2021 InsureandGo was purchased by AllClear Travel Insurance, following Mapfre Asistencia’s withdrawal from the UK Travel Insurance market. In November, it entered a new underwriter relationship with Zurich PLC

Being controlled through InsurEvo (IES) Limited after being sold to AllClear, it has been based solely in the Southend office. However, on August 16, 2024, NSM Insurance Group announced that it had completed the purchase of AllClear and InsureandGo.
