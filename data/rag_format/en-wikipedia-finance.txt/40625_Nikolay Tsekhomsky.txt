### MTS

In September 2002, Tsekhomsky took similar position with the telecom operator Mobile TeleSystems, and was promoted to vice president of finance and investment in July 2003. His main task was to overcome the atomism of the business that had occurred due to acquiring other market players: regional companies acquired by MTS had kept their management, standards and financial report systems that differed from those established in parent company.

### Barclays Bank

Barclays bank Russia was created in spring 2008 with the acquisition of Ekspobank by the British financial group and became the second attempt for Barclays to open a commercial bank in Russia (the first attempt in 1998 failed, and 250 million pounds were lost). Before the deal, Ekspobank occupied the 77th place in the country with 30,7 billion rub. in terms of capital, but during the crisis years of 2008-2009 its assets have decreased by 48% and the bank fell to the 127th place.
