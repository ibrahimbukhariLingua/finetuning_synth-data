Private activity bond


# Private activity bond



In general, a **private activity bond** is a bond issued by or on behalf of a local or state government for the purpose of financing the project of a private user.


## Application within the United States

Section 141(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the term private activity bond means any bond issued as part of an issue which meets:

Under Treasury Regulation section 1.141-2, an interest on a private activity bond is not excludable from gross income under section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code unless the bond is a *qualified* bond. Interest from private activity bonds became subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. All things equal, yields on private activity bonds are higher due to this tax treatment.
