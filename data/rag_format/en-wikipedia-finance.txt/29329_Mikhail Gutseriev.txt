### RussNeft case

In 2006 he was accused of tax evasion, forcing him to sell RussNeft at a fraction of its value, before fleeing to London, due to fears of persecution and legal repercussions in Russia.

In the end of July 2007 Gutseriev in an open letter announced that authorities made an unprecedented pressure on him, and he was forced to sell RussNeft to the Basic Element holding, owned by loyal to the Kremlin Oleg Deripaska. Gutseriev stepped down as a President of RussNeft and announced his suspension of entrepreneurial activity (apart from RussNeft he owned Russian coal and many other companies) and his decision to move on to scientific endeavor.

On 28 August 2007 The Tverskoy court of Moscow issued arrest warrant in absentia for Gutseriev, meeting the request of the Investigative Committee under the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

### Activities for the release of victims of kidnapping and hostage-taking

Between 1996 and 2006, Gutseriev played a key role in helping the Russian special services to release a large number of hostages kidnapped in the North Caucasus by various criminal groups. Thus, according to the memoirs of A. Kh. Amirkhanov, M. S. Gutseriev, being at that time the Vice-Speaker of the State Duma, "was the principal liaison in all negotiations and all special operations for the release of hostages." In particular, thanks to Gutseriev's activities, the following people were rescued from captivity: Slovak construction person Imrich Rigo (kidnapped on 10 October 1996, released on 14 February 1997), director of the Swiss firm Seibert-Stinnes Robert Hill (kidnapped on 2 February 1997, released on 2 July 1997) and director of a brick factory from Serbia Milan Evtic (kidnapped in December 1997). Gutseriev also "played a decisive role" in the release of Stanislav Taslitsky, the head of the construction of a water pipeline in Ingushetia, and the banker Viktor Morgun, from the captivity.

On 1 May 1998, Valentin Vlasov, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the Government of the Russian Federation in the Chechen Republic, was captured by a group of Chechen militants on the Rostov-Baku highway. Being aware of his successful experience of the hostages release, officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia appealed to Gutseriev to help organize the negotiation process. According to the memoirs of the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation (1998-1999) and the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation (1999) Sergey Stepashin, the negotiation process was led by Gutseriev, thanks to whom it was possible to determine the location of Vlasov. Thanks to a special operation conducted under the leadership of Deputy Interior Minister V. Rushailo, on 13 November 1998, V. Vlasov was released. According to Stepashin, Gutseriev refused a state award for this special operation.

On 29 January 1998, in Vladikavkaz, a French citizen, representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Vincent Cochetel, was kidnapped. From Moscow, the operation to liberate Cochetel was led by Interior Minister S. Stepashin, and the negotiations and all contacts were conducted by Gutseriev. On 12 December 1998, Vincent Cochetel was released as a result of a special operation carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation with the participation of RF Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Rushailo and Mikhail Gutseriev. For this operation, Stepashin was awarded the Order of the Commander of the Legion of Honor by French President Jacques Chirac. According to S. Stepashin, "this award is our joint one with Mikhail Gutseriev, although, as I have already said, he treated the orders quite philosophically".

In addition, it is known about the participation of M. Gutseriev in organizing the release from captivity of the captain of the Russian Armed Forces Vitaly Korotin, major of the North Caucasian RUBOP of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Vitaly Khapov and five employees of the regiment of the patrol and guard service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Gutseriev also took part in the successful release of five women who were fraudulently lured to Chechnya and abducted. Besides, Gutseriev was among those who rescued from captivity Ilez Deniev, a religious figure and the son of Sheikh Deni Arsanov.

In early 1999, S. Stepashin asked Gutseriev to help rescue the servants of the Russian Orthodox Church, Peter Makarov and Sergei Potapov. They were released in May of the same year along with five Russian servicemen.

In 1999, during the assault of Grozny by the armed forces, Gutseriev managed to agree with war lords upon the evacuation of about 90 people living in a nursing home in the Staropromyslovsky district of the capital of the Chechen Republic.

On 4 October 1999, Dmitry Balburov, a journalist of the Moscow News, was kidnapped in Chechnya. Gutseriev took part in his release.
On 1 September 2004, terrorists took hostages at school No. 1 in Beslan. In the evening of the same day, the operational headquarters organized to rescue the hostages decided to involve Gutseriev in the negotiation process. On the morning of 2 September 2004, Gutseriev came into contact with terrorists and began negotiations. He obtained a number of concessions from the terrorists, namely to accept supplies of drinking water for children, to evacuate the bodies of the hostages they killed and to release 26 people (24 children were taken out from the school). During the negotiations Gutseriev offered himself as a hostage, asking to release the children, but the terrorists refused. According to the memoirs of A. Kh. Amirkhanov, after Beslan, Basayev said that Gutseriev "deceived the mujahideen in Beslan, telling them that there would definitely not be an assault, and persuaded them to let the Ministry of Emergency Situations car with special forces near the building. […] We will make him choke on his own blood and feel all its bitterness." Many of the hostages were not rescued. Nevertheless, according to the conclusion of the commission for evaluation of the operational headquarters actions, "the involvement of reputable members of the Ingush diaspora Gutseriev and Aushev in the negotiations was a timely measure, adequate to the current situation".

In 2006, at the request of the authorities, Gutseriev was again involved in the negotiation process and helped to release a member of the Ingush parliament, Magomed Chakhkiev.

For many years of work on the release of kidnapping and hostage-taking victims, Gutseriev was repeatedly offered various state orders and medals, but he always refused them with the words: "I just fulfilled my civic duty. And on human grief, I won't hang a medal on my chest".".
