## History

In August 2018, Wisr launched Australia's first credit score comparison site, WisrCredit.

In March 2019, the company launched the Wisr App, Australia's first app that lets the user round-up digital spare change to pay down debt such as credit cards.

In March 2019, Wisr undertook a $15 million capital raise through Placement shares.

In November 2019, the NAB-backed Wisr Warehouse loan funding facility went live with an initial $50 million commitment. The Wisr Warehouse was increased from $95 million to $150 million in July 2020, $250 million in October 2020 and then $350 million in March 2021.
