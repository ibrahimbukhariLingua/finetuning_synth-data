Ember (non-profit organisation)


# Ember (non-profit organisation)



**Ember**, formerly **Sandbag**, is an independent global energy think tank that uses data and policy to accelerate the clean energy transition. Headquartered in the UK, the organisation was launched in 2008 by Bryony Worthington.


## History

Ember was originally founded in 2008 as Sandbag, focussing on the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme, allowing its members to campaign to reduce the number of permits in circulation and to purchase permits and cancel them.

Sandbag was re-branded as Ember in 2020 with a focus on the global power sector, while a separate Brussels-based organisation was established to continue work on the ETS.


## Research

Ember currently produces research on global electricity trends and coal mine methane emissions, including research on the EU, India, Indonesia, Australia and Türkiye.


## Data

Ember’s open data covers annual electricity generation data for over 200 countries and regions, and monthly electricity generation data for 85 countries and regions. It also provides 16 open data tools which track regional and global electricity transitions and coal mine methane emissions standards.
