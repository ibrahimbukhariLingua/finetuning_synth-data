## Controversies

In September 2014, Hoenig stirred up controversy over racial profiling in a Fox News commentary piece, stating that "We should have been profiling on September 12, 2001. Let's take a trip down memory lane here: the last war this country won, we put Japanese-Americans in internment camps. We dropped nuclear bombs on residential city centers. Yes, profiling would be at least a good start. It's not on skin color, however. It's on ideology. Muslim, Islamists, jihadist-that's a good start but only a start. We need to stop giving Qur'ans to Gitmo prisoners. We need to stop having Ramadan celebrations in the White House. We have to stop saying the enemy is not Islamic; they are. That's how you get started."

In February 2015, Hoenig said on Fox News that those advocating mandatory vaccinations for the "so-called public good" could be ushering in "forced abortions" and "forced pills."
