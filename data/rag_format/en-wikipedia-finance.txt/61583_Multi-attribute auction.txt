A **multi-attribute auction** is a type of auction in which the bids have multiple parts. Multi-attribute auctions allow agents to sell and purchase goods and services, taking into account more attributes than just price (e.g. service time, tolerances, qualities, etc.).


## History

The earliest research paper about a multi-attribute auction appeared in a 1994 discussion on construction contracts. In 1997, they were discussed in the context of long-term electricity contracts.


## Attributes

The structural elements of a bid are called designated *attributes*. Attributes may be verifiable, unverifiable, or auctioneer-provided. If bids include a single quality, such as price, the auction is referred to as a *single-attribute auction*. Generally, bids are prices in English auctions, and confirmations in Dutch and Japanese auctions. In Brazilian auctions, they refer to the numbers of units being traded.

A scoring, or utility function, is essential for multi-attribute auctions, as it calculates a single number from multiple attributes, making bids that vary in multiple ways comparable.
This scoring function is announced by the auctioneer to the bidders before the start of the auction.
