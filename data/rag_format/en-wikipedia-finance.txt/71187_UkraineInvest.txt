UkraineInvest was created by Daniel Bilak, a Canadian lawyer who was closely involved in the country's development since 1991. Between 2016 and 2019, he was an investment advisor to Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman and created UkraineInvest, the government's investment promotion agency. Bilak was also an active member of the Ukrainian Freedom Fund, which financed the Territorial Defense Forces.

Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, foreign interests in Ukrainian investments boomed. Between March 2022 and September 2023, foreign investments channeled by UkraineInvest reached $500 million. Many investments were also aimed at developing Western multinationals' assets in Ukraine. In March 2024, UkraineInvest signed a memorandum of cooperation with the UN Global Compact to encourage sustainable business policies, and established the Ukraine Business Compact to facilitate the participation of foreign assets to the country's recovery. UkraineInvest had previously signed a memorandum of cooperation with Business France.


## Sectors

UkraineInvest highlights Ukraine's benefits to foreign investors in its 1+4 sector strategy when promoting those economic sectors where Ukraine enjoys a distinct comparative advantage:

1. Innovation Technologies (artificial intelligence, cyber security, nanotechnologies).
2. Agribusiness (food processing, primary production),
3. Energy (esp. renewables and energy-efficiency),
4. Manufacturing (clusters – automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals),
5. Infrastructure (ports and airports, transportation infrastructure).

All of these are enhanced by Ukraine's rapidly developing high-tech industries which provide encompassing innovative value. Collectively, they assist with unlocking new investment and help Ukraine's integration into the global value chain of world markets.
