## Early life

Anthony Christopher Gallagher was born in November 1951. His father was an Irish builder, who settled in the Midlands after the Second World War.


## Career

At various times, Gallagher has specialised in buying and preparing land plots for residential and commercial development, as well as investing directly in retail parks.

In February 2017, London & Quadrant, a housing association, completed a deal to buy the private land company Gallagher Estates for £505 million. Before the company's sale, Gallagher owned more than 45,000 house building plots throughout Britain. The sale of Gallagher Estates is understood to have not included Gallagher's commercial development plots and retail park assets.

Gallagher owns Sarsden House, a Grade II listed 17th-century mansion near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. It was formerly owned by the politician Shaun Woodward, who in 2005 was selling it for £25 million.
