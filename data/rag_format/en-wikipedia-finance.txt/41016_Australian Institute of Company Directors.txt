## History

The origins of the AICD can be traced back to the United Kingdom's Institute of Directors (IoD), formed by royal charter in 1906. Branches of the IoD appeared in the Australian states in the 1960s. These branches were amalgamated in January 1971 under the Institute of Directors in Australia, an autonomous body affiliated with the IoD in the United Kingdom. The challenge of servicing state branches saw the emergence of the Company Directors Association of Australia in 1982. The two bodies merged on 1 January 1990 to form the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

In 2022, an AICD seminar on cybersecurity was crashed by hackers.


### International associations
