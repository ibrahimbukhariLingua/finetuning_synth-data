## History

Through the roots of the Alston, Miller & Gaines’ predecessor firms, the merger with Jones, Bird and Howell formed Alston & Bird on December 1, 1982. Expansion beyond Georgia began with the establishment of an office in Washington, D.C., followed by the 1997 merger with intellectual property-focused Bell Seltzer Park & Gibson (Charlotte and Raleigh), Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green in 2001 (New York), and Crews, Shepherd & McCarty LLP in 2007 (Dallas).

In August 2008, the firm opened a Silicon Valley office with attorneys from the national firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. The next month, Alston & Bird acquired Weston Benshoof Rochefort Rubalcava and MacCuish LLP (which had a total of ~100 lawyers), launching in Los Angeles and Ventura County to reach nine offices nationwide. In March 2017, the firm opened its San Francisco office. In September 2019, the firm opened their London office.

Today, the firm is headquartered in Midtown Atlanta in One Atlantic Center.

In February 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Deputy Director, Brian Johnson, left the agency to become a partner at Alston & Bird LLP.
