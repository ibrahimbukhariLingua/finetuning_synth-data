Liesman received criticism for his Pulitzer in the Nation from journalists Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames, who believed that Liesman's overly optimistic economic outlook in the run-up to the Russian Financial Crisis was attributed to Liesman's sourcing from controversial figures such as Anatoly Chubais and others in favor of the ongoing privatization efforts in the country.
