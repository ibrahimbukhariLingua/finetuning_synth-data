# JPMorgan Chase Building (San Francisco)



The **JPMorgan Chase Building** is an office building in San Francisco, California, 560–584 Mission Street, on the border between South of Market and the Financial District. Designed by architect César Pelli, the building stands 128.02 m (420.0 ft) and has about 655,000 square feet (60,900 m²) of office space. It also has two levels of underground parking and a large plaza. About 400,000 sq ft (37,000 m²) of the building is leased to the major tenant JPMorgan Chase. This is one of many new highrise projects completed or under construction on Mission Street since 2000.


## Construction and design

*SF Curbed* describes the building, designed by Cesar Pelli, as a "circa-2002, 31-story minimalist tower wrapped in black steel." The 31-story building is located at 560 Mission Street. Pelli took visual inspiration from the Hallidie Building.

Says *SF Gate*, the plaza at 560 Mission Street as "outdoor slip of manicured heaven: terraces of grass, groves of bamboo, potted maples in between. Plus plenty of tables and a circular metal sculpture turning gently above a thin sheet of water," saying it has " only bamboo, Japanese maple and grass growing, along with a granite-lined pool and granite and stainless-steel sculpture."


## Plaza

The building's public space has been noted in the press, called one of the "best privately owned open places" in the city by *Curbed.*

The Privately Owned Public Open Space at the foot of the tower consists of a parklet containing a water feature with seating, a bamboo grove and the kinetic sculpture *Annular Eclipse* by George Rickey.

Landscape design for the parklet was done by Christian Lemon at the firm Hart Howerton.
