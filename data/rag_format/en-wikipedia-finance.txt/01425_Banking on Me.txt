## Background and composition

Gunna previewed "Banking on Me" through an Instagram story in late 2021. On January 11, 2022, he released the deluxe edition of his third studio album, *DS4Ever*, with the song being one of four new tracks, but removed the deluxe edition the same day. Gunna later released it as a single on Valentine's Day. Gunna raps over romantic piano lines with crudely suggestive lyrics, saying he would not want to "get tired" of his girlfriend, who delivers sexual variety.
