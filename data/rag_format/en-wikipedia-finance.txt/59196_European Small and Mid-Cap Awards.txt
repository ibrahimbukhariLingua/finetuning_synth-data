European Small and Mid-Cap Awards


# European Small and Mid-Cap Awards



The **European Small and Mid-Cap Awards** aim to promote best practices and encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access capital markets via initial public offering. A joint initiative of the European Commission, EuropeanIssuers and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, the ceremony was organised for the first time in 2013.


## Background

The awards ceremony was organised for the first time in 2013 by EuropeanIssuers and the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), at the initiative of the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (now Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs) of the European Commission. These two associations represent together the European securities exchanges and the companies listed on them. The awards showcase the diversity of European markets, and aim to promote stock listings and target SMEs and growth companies. The awards affirm that these companies are critical to European economic recovery and to accomplishing the EU's goals of job creation, competitiveness and growth.

Since 2020, the Awards is organised as part of the European Commission's SME Assembly.
