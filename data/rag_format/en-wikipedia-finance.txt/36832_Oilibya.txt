## Expansion & oil exploration

In 2008, OiLibya entered the Ethiopian market acquiring 100% of Shell's Ethiopia and Djibouti petroleum retail business. The amount of money spent by Oilibya to close the deal was unrevealed. Oilibya has bought many other retail petroleum dealers in Africa, including taking over ExxonMobil's business in Kenya.

Bahru said at the time the sale was consistent with Shell's global strategy to focus on oil exploration and get out of retail business.

## 2011 Libyan civil war

In February 2011, some African countries began to express concerns as to how the 2011 Libyan civil war might affect OiLibya and its outlets across the region. Of particular concern were the huge debts racked up by Libya's key enterprises.
