Cash-less Nigeria


# Cash-less Nigeria

It prescribed a cash handling charges on daily withdrawal above five hundred thousand Naira (N500,000.00) for individuals and three million Naira for corporate bodies (N3, 000,000.00). The policy was enforced not to eliminate the use of cash, but to reduce the volume of cash in circulation.

A pilot run of the policy started on 1 January 2012 in Lagos State. The service charges were with held until 30 March of the same year to allow for seamless migration from manual to electronic devices.
