## Controversies


### Animal cruelty allegations


#### Caged eggs in Ayala Land's global supply chain

Ayala Land's hospitality arm *Ayala Land Hotels and Resorts* which operates Raffles Makati and Seda Hotels as well as El Nido Resorts in the Philippines, has been facing negative publicity for using of battery-cage eggs in its supply chain. Due to the cruel conditions on those farms, as well as the health risks associated with eggs produced in battery cages, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned caged farms back in 2012.
