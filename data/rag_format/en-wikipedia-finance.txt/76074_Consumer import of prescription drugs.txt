Consumer import of prescription drugs


# Consumer import of prescription drugs



**Consumer import of prescription drugs** refers to an individual person, typically a patient, getting prescription drugs from a foreign country for their own personal use in their own country.


## Import mechanisms

People can have drugs shipped to them from online pharmacies. They may travel internationally for the purpose of medical tourism, and purchase drugs there to be used back home.


## Causes

Individual consumers will only consider seeking drugs from other countries if they have some barrier to access in their own country. One barrier to access is high local prices compared to other markets. Another barrier to access could be legal restrictions preventing an individual from getting a drug they want or need.


### International drug market prices

In some markets, drug prices are set or influenced by the prices in other, nearby markets. In Europe, for example, people freely and easily travel to different countries, and the price of a certain drug in one country affects the price in other, nearby countries. Having this kind of competitive exchange can keep prices low, but it can also lead to lowered drug accessibility. Sometimes a manufacturer may choose not to offer a drug in one market, to ensure success in selling the drug at a higher price in a different market.

Businesses, manufacturers and drug retailers wish to control the supply of pharmaceuticals in their own marketplace. As such, if low-cost drugs entered a market from other lower-cost territories, what might develop is pure price-based selling. The TRIPS agreement is an example of a World Trade Organization treaty which regulates how drugs can be traded in the international marketplace.

Some developing countries might receive access to lower-cost drugs through compulsory licenses. Compulsory licenses affect markets outside the country in which they are issued.


### Variation in legality

Drugs which are legal in one place may not be legal in another.

Two organizations, the Canadian International Pharmacy Association and the PharmacyChecker Verification Program, verify the safety and legitimacy of online pharmacies that ship from Canada to the United States.
