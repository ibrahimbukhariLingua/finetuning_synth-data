Secretary for Economic Services


# Secretary for Economic Services



The **Secretary for Economic Services** (Chinese: 經濟司 and later 經濟局局長) was a minister position in the Government of Hong Kong, which is responsible for economic development in Hong Kong. The position was renamed to the **Secretary for Economic Development and Labour** (Chinese: 經濟發展及勞工局) after nearly thirty years. The new position headed the Economic Development and Labour Bureau and was created together with the introduction of Principal Officials Accountability System on 1 July 2002, by merging the positions with the labour portfolio of Secretary for Education and Manpower. After POAS was introduced all secretaries are members of the Executive Council.

The position was abolished in 2007 when the Economic Development and Labour Bureau was abolished and its functions transferred to the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Transport and Housing Bureau, and the Labour and Welfare Bureau.
