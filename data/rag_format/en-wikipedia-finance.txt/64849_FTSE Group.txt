# FTSE Group



**FTSE International Limited** trading as FTSE Russell (/ˈfʊtsi/ "Footsie") is a British provider of stock market indices and associated data services, wholly owned by the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and operating from premises in Canary Wharf. It operates the well known UK FTSE 100 Index as well as a number of other indices. FTSE stands for **Financial Times Stock Exchange**.


## History

The FTSE Group was created in 1995 by Pearson (former parent of the *Financial Times*) and the London Stock Exchange Group.

In 2005, together with Dow Jones, FTSE launched the Industry Classification Benchmark, a taxonomy used to segregate markets into sectors.

In 2010, the joint venture with Xinhua Finance was terminated, the index series was renamed into FTSE China Index Series; the Hong Kong incorporated company was renamed to "FTSE China Index Limited".

In 2011, Pearson sold its stake to LSE.


## Main business
