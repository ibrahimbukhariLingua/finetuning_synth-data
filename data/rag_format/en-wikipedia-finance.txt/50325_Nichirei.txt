## History

The company was founded on 24 December 1942, as Teikoku Marine Products Control Company, with capital participation from 18 fisheries and other companies. It was established in accordance with the Fisheries Control Ordinance that was enacted on 19 May 1942, as a central agency to control seafood-related businesses such as sales of marine products, ice production, and refrigerated storage. On 1 December 1945, the day after the control ordinance was abolished (30 November 1945), the company was reorganized as a privately held company governed by the commercial code, and was renamed Nippon Reizo Co. Ltd. The new company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1949. Nippon Reizon changed its name to Nichirei Corporation in 1985.
