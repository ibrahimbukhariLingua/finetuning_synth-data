# Altice (company)



**Altice Europe N.V.** (commonly known as **Altice**) is a Dutch multinational telecommunications and mass media company with official headquarters in the Netherlands, founded and headed by the French-Israeli billionaire businessman Patrick Drahi, and the second largest telecoms company in France, behind Orange.

It had a market capitalization of €13.7 billion in December 2017, and a market cap of less than €6 billion in June 2019, a 56% decline for the stock since Drahi financed the business with debt. In 2016, the company had over 50 million internet, TV, and phone customers in Western Europe, Israel, the United States (where it formerly operated) and the Caribbean. Altice formerly owned a subsidiary in the USA until that company, while retaining the Altice name, was spun off through an IPO in June 2019, making the former USA division independent from the rest of Altice but retaining the same chairman, Patrick Drahi, and the same logo.

## Criticism


### Involvement in Israeli settlements

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of all business enterprises involved in certain specified activities related to the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Golan Heights. Altice has been listed on the database in light of its involvement in activities related to "the provision of services and utilities supporting the maintenance and existence of settlements". The international community considers Israeli settlements built on land occupied by Israel to be in violation of international law.

On 5 July 2021, Norway's largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from Altice together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
