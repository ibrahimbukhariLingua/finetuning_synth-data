## Governance

A Council is elected and appointed by members regionally. The council is responsible for appointing the Board and assisting management in ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of members.
The council also advises the Board and management on member and strategic issues.

The Board is the delegated decision-making body. It operates on a corporate model and has oversight responsibility for the development and approval of long-term strategy and performance including key policy issues and oversight of risk.

The Executive Team supports the CEO and is responsible for the day-to-day operation.

Regional Councils represent members in Australia and New Zealand by providing a voice for the members in their region and advising the council on member issues.

Every Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand member living in New Zealand is represented by a Local Leadership Team (LLT) in their area.


## Membership


### Chartered Accountants

The Chartered Accountant (CA) designation denotes an accountant qualified to offer the full range of accounting services privately and to the public.


### Provisional Membership

CA ANZ grants provisional membership to members who have obtained a tertiary degree that is accredited by the organisation. Alternative pathways to provisional membership is available through the CA foundations program if the candidate does not possess an accredited degree. A provisional membership is required to begin the CA Program needed for full membership.


### CA Program

To be eligible for full membership, candidates must complete three years full time (or part-time equivalent) experience, and not less than 500 days on a relevant accounting role as part of the Mentored Practical Experience.

Candidates must also pass the Graduate Diploma of Chartered Accounting (GradDipCA) course, consisting of seven core subjects and two electives.

Core subjects offered include:

* *Ethics and Business* (EB)
* *Risk and Technology* (RT)
* *Financial Accounting and Reporting* (FAR)
* *Taxation* (TAX) (Offered in either the Australian or New Zealand version)
* *Audit and Risk* (AR)
* *Business Performance* (BP)
* *Integrated Chartered Accounting Practice* (ICAP)

### Associate Chartered Accountants

The *Associate Chartered Accountant* (ACA) designation is a mid-level qualification. The designation recognises individuals who may not wish to train to be Chartered Accountants but who want to be recognised for their skills in business and finance. The ACA designation is currently available in New Zealand only.

The designation *Associate Chartered Accountant* is not directly comparable to the *Associate Chartered Accountant* (ACA) designation offered by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.


### Accounting Technicians

The Accounting Technician (AT) designation is for individuals employed to oversee and manage financial accounts in roles such as Accounts Manager or Assistant Finance Manager. The AT designation is currently available in New Zealand only.

New Zealand's practice in this respect is not followed in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, accounting technicians generally belong to the Association of Accounting Technicians.


### Fellowship

Fellowships (FCA) are awards granted to CA ANZ members to recognise outstanding achievement in and/or contribution to the profession of accounting at either a local, national or international level. Notable fellows include Shelley Griffiths and Ros Whiting.
