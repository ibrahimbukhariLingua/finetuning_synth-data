**Gogoro Inc.** is a Taiwanese company that developed a battery-swapping refueling platform for urban electric two-wheel scooters, mopeds and motorcycles. It also develops its own line of electric scooters and offers its own vehicle innovations to vehicle maker partners like Yamaha, Aeon Motor, PGO, eReady, and eMOVING. Gogoro also operates GoShare, a rideshare service, in Taiwan and Ishigaki Island in Japan.

## History

Gogoro was founded in 2011 by entrepreneurs Horace Luke and Matt Taylor. In its year of inception, Gogoro secured $50 million in seed funding from Dr. Samuel Yin of Ruentex Group and Cher Wang. In October 2014, Gogoro raised an additional $100 million in Series B funding from a collection of investors. In November 2015, Gogoro announced a $30 million round of investment from Panasonic and Taiwan's National Development Fund Archived 2016-12-04 at the Wayback Machine. In September 2017, Gogoro announced a $300 million Series C round of investment from Singapore's Temasek, Generation Investment Management (co-founded by Al Gore), Japan's Sumitomo Corporation, and French utility Engie, increasing the Smartscooter innovator's capital up to US$480 million. The company went public in 2022 with its merger with Nasdaq-listed special-purpose acquisition company Poema Global.

On April 21, 2021, Gogoro announced a strategic partnership with the world's top two-wheel vehicle maker, Hero MotoCorp, to roll out its Gogoro Network battery swapping in India.

In December 2020, analyst firm Frost & Sullivan recognized Gogoro as the 2020 Global Company of the Year Award for the Swappable Battery Electric Scooter Market.

In June 2024, the Castrol lubricants division of multinational oil giant BP announced plans to invest up to $50M in Gogoro.

In September 2024, Gogoro's CEO and chairman Horace Luke had stepped down amid subsidy fraud allegations.

On October 1, 2024, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs released its review conclusion and stated that there was insufficient evidence to determine that the reported vehicle model violated localization regulations.


## Gogoro Network

The Gogoro Network is a modular battery swapping infrastructure designed to be deployed in cities for electric refueling of two-wheel vehicles like scooters, mopeds, and motorcycles. Riders would be able to swap out depleted batteries at a network of kiosks called GoStations for a monthly subscription fee. According to Gogoro, as of April 2021 in its pilot market of Taiwan, Gogoro Network had 370,000 riders and managed more than 175 million battery swaps, 265,000 per day, through its 2,000 GoStations.

The Gogoro Smartscooter was the first vehicle to be integrated into the Gogoro Network in 2015.

The network also includes the Powered by Gogoro Network (PBGN) program, through which other manufacturers of electric motor scooters can build scooters that utilize the Gogoro Network infrastructure. Gogoro has several vehicle maker partners participating in PBGN, including:

In 2022, Gogoro announced it planned to launch in Singapore.
