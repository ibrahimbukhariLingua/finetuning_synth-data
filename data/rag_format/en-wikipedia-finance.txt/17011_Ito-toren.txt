# Ito-toren



The **Ito-toren** (Dutch for **Ito Tower**) is a 100 metres (328 feet) tall office building in the Zuidas in the Dutch capital city Amsterdam. The building is part of the Mahler4 complex and has inside that complex the code "1AH".


## Construction and ownership

The construction of the Ito-toren was part of the first construction phase of Mahler4 and took place between September 2002 and June 2005. In June 2004, the building was topped out. The developers of the Ito-toren were G&S Vastgoed, Fortis Vastgoed Ontwikkeling and ING Real Estate. Toyo Ito, after whom the building is named, and his architecture firm designed the office building. ZZDP Architecten was involved in the design process as well. The company Van der Vorm was the engineer.

In December 2002, the developer G&S Vastgoed sold the building for €133.5 million to the German company Commerz Grundbesitz-Investmentgesellschaft (CGI), a Commerz Real company. At the same time, CGI bought the office building SOM and the parking garage, both parts of Mahler4 as well. CGI was together with the three developers involved as an investor in the project since 1999. Commerz Real was negotiating with Tishman Speyer in order to sell the Ito-toren at the end of 2013, but the companies didn't reach an agreement. The German company Union Investment did reach an agreement on April 15, 2014 and thus bought the Ito-toren for €172.8 million, which was €200,000 more than the estimated value by an appraiser. The nearby office building SOM was again sold at the same time.
