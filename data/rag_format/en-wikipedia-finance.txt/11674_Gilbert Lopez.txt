**Gilbert T. Lopez Jr.** (born 1943) is the former chief accounting officer of Stanford Financial Group. He is best known for his involvement in the Allen Stanford Ponzi Scheme fraud.


## History

Lopez was found guilty by a federal jury in Houston on November 19, 2012, of aiding Robert Allen Stanford in a fraud scheme involving Stanford International Bank (SIB).

Evidence at Lopez's trial showed that he knew about and monitored Stanford's misappropriation of SIB's assets, concealed the misappropriation from the public and nearly every other Stanford employee, and worked behind the scenes to keep it from being discovered. Additionally, he assisted Stanford in deceiving SIB clients during the late 2008 financial crisis by claiming that Stanford had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in SIB when in fact he had not. Lopez assisted in the creation of a fraudulent real estate deal that involved inflating the value of land parcels that were bought for $63.5 million to a fictitious $3.2 billion.

Prosecutor Jeffrey Goldberg said Stanford could not have carried out the fraud without help. He said Lopez - in his post as chief accounting of Stanford Financial Group - actively covered up his boss’s fraud. “Gil Lopez and Mark Kuhrt were faced with the same choice over and over again, to either help Allen Stanford lie to his customers and misuse their money or say ‘I don’t want to be part of it”. The men chose to “keep it secret and actively work to keep others from finding out about it.” added Goldberg during the trial.

Lopez's trial lasted for five weeks. The jury deliberated for about three days before finding Lopez guilty on ten of the eleven counts in the indictment. He was found guilty on nine counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. On one count of wire fraud, Lopez was found not guilty. He was promptly remanded into custody following the trial.

On February 14, 2013 Lopez was sentenced to 20 years in prison. In addition to the prison terms, U.S. District Judge David Hittner, who presided over the trial, sentenced Lopez to serve three years of supervised release and ordered Lopez to pay a $25,000 fine. Judge Hittner also found that Lopez obstructed justice by committing perjury at trial.

The conviction was upheld by the appeals court on June 5, 2015.
