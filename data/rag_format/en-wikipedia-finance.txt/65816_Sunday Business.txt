Sunday Business


# Sunday Business



***Sunday Business*** was a national Sunday broadsheet financial newspaper published in the United Kingdom, which ran from 1996 to 2006, when it was turned into a magazine called *The Business*.


## History

The newspaper was founded by Tom Rubython in order to provide a Sunday alternative to the *Financial Times*, achieving sales of around 150,000 on launch, falling to fewer than 20,000 within months.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 1997 the title was bought by the Barclay Brothers, David and Frederick Barclay, who at the time owned *The European* newspaper and subsequently, *The Daily Telegraph* and *The Scotsman*.

It was re-launched on 15 February 1998 with an exclusive interview with Gordon Brown, who promised a budget tailored towards the business community. *The Sunday Business* became a critical successᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and within its first two years of production had won numerous industry awards, including Newspaper of The Year (1999) and Newspaper Design of the Year (1998, 2000).

The newspaper became known as a launchpad for the successful careers of the small team put together by editor Jeff Randall in the winter of 1997/8.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
The newspaper made various moves, both in editorial style and physical location. The newspaper was originally based in Cavendish Square in Central London, while the re-launched newspaper was based in the offices of ITN News in Gray's Inn Road, moving on to South Quay in London Docklands in 2000 and then finally back to the City at Waterhouse Square.

By the summer of 2003, most of the re-launch team had been head-hunted by rival national newspapers,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ and production of the newspaper was handed over to the Press Association. From its offices in London's Victoria, and under the editorship of Andrew Neil, it was rebranded *The Business* – a weekly glossy magazine – in the autumn of 2006.

That magazine disappeared in 2008 as it was merged into *The Spectator* and subsequently re-emerged as the monthly *Spectator Business* magazine.
