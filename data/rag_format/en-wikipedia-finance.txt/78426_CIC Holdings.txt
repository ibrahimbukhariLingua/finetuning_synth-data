## History

Chemical Industries (Colombo) was founded in 1964 as a part of Imperial Chemical Industries, a former UK-based chemical company. The company shifted its business model by moving into agribusiness away from Dulux paints and fertilizer. To reflect the change the company was planning to change the name of the company. The company followed up this by changing its name to the current name in 2011. The company signed an agreement with the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology to develop a new herbicide formulation. The initiative is one of the first attempts to synthesize and formulate a herbicide locally in Sri Lanka. The company appointed Dinesh Weerakkody as an Independent non-Executive Director and Amal Cabraal as the non-Executive Chairman of CIC Feeds in 2015. In November 2015, the company sold its subsidiary, Chemifix, a PVAc adhesive business to Pidilite Industries.
