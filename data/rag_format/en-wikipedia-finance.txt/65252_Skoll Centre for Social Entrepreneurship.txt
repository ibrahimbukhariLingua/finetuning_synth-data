# Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship



The **Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship** is an academic entity for the advancement of social entrepreneurship at Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford. The Centre's goal is to "maximise the impact of social entrepreneurship to transform unjust or unsatisfactory systems or practices around the world and address critical social and environmental challenges."


## History

In November 2003, the Skoll Foundation, a social entrepreneurship foundation founded by Jeff Skoll, donated $7.5 million to the Saïd Business School for the creation of **The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship** in order to promote the advancement of social entrepreneurship worldwide. The Centre acts as a network hub for social entrepreneurship, linking together key actors in the sector and contributing towards creating new and effective partnerships for sustainable social change. It engages in social innovation and aims to have a decisive influence on policy.


## Research and Education

The Skoll Centre’s research ranges across three main topic areas identified by practitioners as of key importance: governance; resources; impact. In each area, a variety of scholarly work is being undertaken. This is disseminated in both applied working paper formats and in peer-reviewed academic books and journals.
