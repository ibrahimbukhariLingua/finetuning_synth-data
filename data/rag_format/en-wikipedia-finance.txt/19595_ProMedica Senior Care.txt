## History

ManorCare began in 1959, when Stewart W. Bainum Sr., a former plumber, opened a nursing home in Wheaton, Maryland. The company went public in 1969.

In 1980, the company merged with the hotel company Quality International, later renamed Choice Hotels, which was also run by Bainum. In 1982, the company acquired nursing home operator Cenco, for $209 million; total facilities were 105, in 19 states. In 1987, Stewart Bainum Jr., became chairman and CEO, succeeding his father.

In 1992, the company spun off Vitalink Pharmacy Services into a public company with a value of $236 million. In 1996, the company spun off Choice Hotels, refocusing its business on health care.

In 1998, Ohio-based Health Care and Retirement Corporation merged with ManorCare to become HCR ManorCare. The company headquarters was consolidated in Toledo.

In March 2000, Stewart W. Bainum Jr., and a management group made separate offers to buy the company, which the company's board rejected. His term as chairman of the board ended in 2001, and in 2002 he left the Board.


## 2007 buyout offer

In July 2007, the company agreed to a $4.9 billion buyout offer from the private equity firm Carlyle Group; it will no longer be a publicly traded corporation. Analysts said that Carlyle was interested in the company because it owns, rather than leases, nearly all its own facilities and boasts arguably the best real-estate portfolio in the business, with generally well-maintained, newer facilities in good locations, and little mortgage debt. By borrowing against the property to finance the buyout, ManorCare and Carlyle can carry out the deal on favorable terms. The buyout was completed at $67 per share on December 21, 2007.

In 2010 HCR ManorCare entered into a sale-leaseback transaction whereby the company sold off 338 post-acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities for US$6.1 billion. These are now owned by HCP, a REIT based within the state of California. These assets are still operated by HCR ManorCare.


## 2018 Welltower and ProMedica joint venture

In March 2018, HCR ManorCare Inc, filed for Chapter 11 protection with $7.1 billion of debt as part of a pre-arranged deal to transfer ownership to its landlord Quality Care Properties Inc.

Welltower Inc., in a $1.95 billion all-cash deal, acquired Quality Care Properties as a joint venture with ProMedica in April 2018. ProMedica acquired the operations of what was then HCR ManorCare for about $1.35 billion in cash plus the assumption of net liabilities. ProMedica began phasing out the "HCR ManorCare" brand in late 2020.

In November 2022, ProMedica announced that it would exit the skilled nursing venture with Welltower.
