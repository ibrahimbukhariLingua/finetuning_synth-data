Holidaybreak


# Holidaybreak



**Holidaybreak Limited** is a company based in London whose main business is the Meininger hotels chain.


## History

By 2007, Holidaybreak held a portfolio of specialist holiday businesses.

Holidaybreak became a wholly owned subsidiary of former competitor Cox & Kings in July 2011 after a long period of attempting to sell two loss-making parts of its business, Explore and Superbreak. Three years later, in June 2014, Cox & Kings announced the sale of the camping division of its subsidiary Holidaybreak Ltd to France’s Homair Vacances, for 89 billion Rs (approx. $145 million).

In 2022, following the 2020 collapse of Cox & Kings, Holidaybreak was ultimately controlled by Ares Management, an American asset management company. It conducts most of its business through Meininger Hotels Limited, which operates hotels in Germany and several other European countries.
