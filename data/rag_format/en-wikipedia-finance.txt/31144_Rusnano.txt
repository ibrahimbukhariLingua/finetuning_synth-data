**Rusnano Group** (Russian: Роснано АО, lit. 'Rosnano plc.') is a Russian state-established and funded company. The Rusnano Group's mission is to create competitive nanotechnology-based industry in Russia. Rusnano invests directly and through indirect funds into all major knowledge-based areas where nanotechnology is widely implemented: electronics, optics, telecom, classic and renewable energy, healthcare and biotechnology, materials and metallurgy, engineering and chemistry.

In 2020 the government of Russia has merged it with VEB.RF. As of 2017 100% shares of Rusnano were owned by the Russian government.

In 2015 Rusnano had 16 investment projects. It invested into about 97 plants and R&D companies in 37 regions of Russia. In 2016 many such enterprises were either dissolved, bankrupted or repurposed (see. below). In 2016 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy significantly devaluating below the equity levels but managed to recover.

In November 2021 trade of company's securities trade was suspended on Moscow Stock Exchange. The same year the company declared net loss of 120 billions rubles, 20 of which were settled, with the rest making into the mid of 2021.

In June 2022 the company led by newly appointed Kulikov Sergei [ru] (Russian: Куликов Сергей) was again on the verge of insolvency.

In October 2022, the media learned that the government was considering liquidating Rusnano. The company's position worsened after the introduction of international sanctions against Russia. Significant assets are supposed to be transferred to other state corporations. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov addressed President Vladimir Putin with a proposal to disband Rusnano.

In September 2023, Vladimir Putin said that there was a “big financial hole” in Rusnano. A month later, the corporation announced its inability to pay its obligations and the possibility of bankruptcy. At this point, the government had not yet decided whether to save Rusnano.


## History

In April 2007 the Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced an Initiative termed «*Strategy for Development of Nanotechnology Industry*» in which he outlined the goals of new Russian policy.

The Group was founded in 2011 by reorganizing Russian Corporation of Nanotechnology, and currently comprises RUSNANO JSC, RUSNANO Management Company LLC and a non-profit Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs (FIEP).

* **RUSNANO JSC** is a holder of Group's assets and is governed by the Board of Directors appointed by Russian Government.
* **RUSNANO Management Company** that was created in 2013, is managing all JSC RUSNANO's assets, leading business development and investment activities. RUSNANO Management Company is governed by the Executive Board and Board of Directors.
* **Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs (FIEP)** was founded in 2013 as a non-profit organization managing various projects targeting creation of innovative nanotechnology-related ecosystem in Russia. All non-profit activities aimed at development of innovative Nano-industry ecosystem were segregated from business units to develop governance and structure of the Group.

These separate legal entities work together on increasing competitiveness and effectiveness of Russian companies in nanotechnology-related industrial fields.
