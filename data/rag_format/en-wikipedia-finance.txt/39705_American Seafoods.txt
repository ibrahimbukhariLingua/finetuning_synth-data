In 2012, the company built the Bayside Canadian Railway – a 220-foot (67 m) railway in Bayside, New Brunswick – to take advantage of a loophole in the Jones Act that otherwise would have required the company to use US-flagged vessels. It was disassembled in April 2023 after a judge determined it to be noncompliant with the act.
