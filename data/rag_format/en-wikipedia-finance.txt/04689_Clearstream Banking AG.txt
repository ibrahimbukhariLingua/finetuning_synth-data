## Overview

On 12 July 1949, the **Frankfurter Kassenverein** was established to handle the settlement and clearance of securities traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange following the wartime and post-war disruption. The word *Kassenverein* was a reference to a number of pre-war financial institutions that provided market infrastructure services in the German-speaking work, including the Berliner Kassenverein [de] and the Wiener Giro- und Cassen-Verein, the latter being described as the oldest CSD.³⁹

In 1970-71, the **Auslandskassenverein** (**AKV**) was formed to act as clearing and settlement agent and international gateway for German banks to various foreign depositories, including but not limited to Cedel in Luxembourg.³⁹

In December 1989, the *Kassenverein* arms of the regional stock exchanges in Berlin, Dusseldorf [de], Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover [de], Munich, and Stuttgart merged as a single CSD for all of Germany, branded **Deutscher Kassenverein** (**DKV**), henceforth a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse.²⁸⁴

In 1996, the AKV was merged into DKV, which was subsequently renamed **Deutsche Börse Clearing AG** (DBC) in 1997.

In 2000, DBC merged with Cedel in Luxembourg, and the merged entity became a fully-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Börse in mid-2002.²⁸⁷
