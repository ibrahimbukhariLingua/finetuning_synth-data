Asset-centricity


# Asset-centricity



**Asset-centricity** is an approach to investing in the life sciences field with a focus on key assets, such as a pharmaceutical molecule that could form the basis for a novel new drug which has already been identified, rather than on discovering such assets through basic research & development.

The asset-centric investing model is an attempt to streamline the drug discovery process, based on the widely held belief that it has become too expensive. It de-couples life sciences assets from the infrastructure necessary to develop them, with the goal of improving returns on invested capital.

A typical asset-centric startup company would have a single asset, or sometimes two, with a team of experts, including drug developers, shared across a back-end structure and across a variety of portfolio life sciences companies. These team members would coalesce for specific, focused drug-discovery projects The bulk of funding would support the development of the primary asset, with the rest supporting a secondary asset and infrastructure.


## History

The asset-centric model of investing was developed by Index Ventures, a venture capital firm.
Forms of the asset-centric model have subsequently been adopted by other life sciences investment firms such as Atlas Venture and Symphony Capital.


## Examples of Asset-Centric companies

* Aegerion Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:Â AEGR)
* Arteas Therapeutics (acquired by Eli Lilly)
