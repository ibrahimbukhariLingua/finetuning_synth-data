2024 Canada Post strike


# 2024 Canada Post strike



The **2024 Canada Post strike** was a strike action against Canada Post by the national membership of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW). The strike began on November 15, 2024 and suspended on December 17. A strike may start again on May 22, 2025.


## Background

Negotiations for a new contract began on November 15, 2023, one year prior to the strike. On August 2, 2024, CUPW filed with the federal Minister of Labour to get conciliators to help mediate. After continued impasse in negotiations and a cooling-off period, the Government of Canada appointed mediators to assist in negotiation that, ultimately, was also unsuccessful.

At the time of the strike, CUPW represented approximately 55,000 striking workers. Its list of demands included:

* wage increases of 24% over four years, which it says will keep wages up to inflation;
* enhancements to group benefits, such as coverage for fertility treatments and gender-affirming care;
* improved protections against technological change;
* enhancements to paid medical leave;
* paid meal and rest periods; and
* increased short-term disability benefits.

Canada Post declined these demands, instead offering wage increases of 11.5% over four years as well as increased paid leave. The crown corporation has described its finances as "unsustainable," reporting over $3 billion in losses since 2018 and debts exceeding $1 billion. In 2023, Canada Post spent $4.9 billion on labour costs against $6.9 billion in revenue, with operating costs per hour for parcel delivery ranging from $50 to $60 versus industry benchmarks of $40 to $50. Unlike many Crown corporations, Canada Post is not taxpayer-funded and must sustain itself entirely on its own revenues.


## Timeline

On November 12, 2024, the CUPW issued a 72-hour strike notice, followed by a 72-hour lockout notice from Canada Post. The deadline for an agreement lapsed on November 15, thus triggering a nationwide strike.

On November 28, 2024, Canada Post temporarily laid off some striking employees. In response, CUPW filed a complaint with the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB), arguing that Canada Post violated the *Canada Labour Code*. In a notice posted to members, CUPW described the layoffs as a "scare tactic" meant to intimidate union members.

On December 1, Canada Post presented a "framework" to CUPW in order to end the strike. CUPW said on their website that its negotiators were reviewing the framework documents.

On December 9, CUPW reduced its wage increase demands from 24% over four years to a 19% raise.

On December 12, Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when the government would step in to end the strike. Trudeau responded that the "best deals are made at the bargaining table". The following day, Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon declared an impasse in the talks, and asked the CIRB to order the postal workers back to work. The CIRB ruled in favour of MacKinnon's proposal, and ordered the strikers to return to work by the morning of December 17. A group of strikers protested the decision at the Moncton office of Employment Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor.

As part of the CIRB's ruling, Canada Post's contracts with its employees were extended until May 2025 to give more time for negotiations.


## Impact


### Domestic

Public reactions to the strike were mixed. In an Angus Reid poll conducted over the strike's third week, 34% of Canadians sided with Canada Post, 29% sided with the striking workers, and 37% were unsure or didn't support either side. Many Canadians accused the striking workers of "cancelling Christmas" due to the strike being so close to the holidays.

To prevent passports from being held in processing centres, Service Canada delayed the distribution of 215,000 passports. About ten million packages were not delivered.

The strike negatively impacted Black Friday sales, with many small businesses unable to ship orders during their peak season. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business reported the strike had cost small and medium-sized businesses $1.6 billion by December 13, and that 73% of small businesses intended to reduce usage of Canada Post.

Canada Post's Santa Claus letter program was suspended, with Canada Post saying that all letters received would be responded to once the strike is over, but that they could not guarantee responses before Christmas. In some communities, members of the public, businesses and union locals organized their own drop boxes to receive letters to Santa.

Due to the strike, Elections Canada did not provide voter information cards for the December 16 by-election in Cloverdaleâ€”Langley City. Some municipalities and condominiums were unable to provide public notices of their meetings.

Thousands of social assistance cheques went undelivered in British Columbia, although most recipients receive direct deposits.


### International

On November 29, Canada Post asked the mail services of all other countries to stop accepting or sending mail to Canada, leaving all mail unprocessed in secure containers from November 15. This mail could not be delivered or even scanned due to the strike.
