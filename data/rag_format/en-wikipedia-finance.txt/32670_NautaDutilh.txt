In 1795, the firm was involved in loan negotiations between Dutch bankers and representatives of the US government to finance the rebuilding and expansion of Washington, D.C.

The firm's partners have a long-standing tradition of public service and many hold academic appointments. In 1903, NautaDutilh hired the first female lawyer in the Netherlands, Adolphine Kok.
