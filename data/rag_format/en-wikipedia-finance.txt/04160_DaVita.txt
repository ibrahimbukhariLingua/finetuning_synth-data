In 2023, 67% of the company's revenues came from Medicare and other government-based health insurance programs. In 2023, 89% of the company's patients were covered by government-based health insurance programs. Commercial payers, which accounted for 33% of revenues in 2023, generate nearly all of the company's profit as they reimburse at a much higher rate than government-based health insurance programs.

The company is ranked 341st on the Fortune 500.

The name "DaVita" was derived from the Italian language phrase "Dare Vita", which means "to give life".


## History

The company was founded in 1979 as Medical Ambulatory Care, Inc., a subsidiary of National Medical Enterprises, Inc. (now Tenet Healthcare).

In August 1994, 70% of the company was acquired by DLJ Merchant Banking Partners in a leveraged buyout for $75.5 million, including a $10.5 million investment by DLJ. The company then changed its name to Total Renal Care Holdings, Inc.

In October 1995, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $107 million.

By December 1996, DLJ had made a 386% return on its $10.5 million investment.

On February 27, 1998, the company acquired Renal Treatment Centers for $1.3 billion in stock.

The integration went poorly and in July 1999, the CEO and CFO resigned. After tripling in value between 1995 and 1998, by July 1999, the stock price was down 71% year-to-date.

In October 1999, Kent J. Thiry, then 43 years old, was named CEO.

In 2000, the company sold its non-U.S. operations.

In October 2014, the company agreed to pay $350 million to settle claims that it provided illegal kickbacks to doctors.

In June 2015, the company agreed to pay $450 million to settle allegations that it unnecessarily disposed of drugs and then billed the U.S. federal government for this waste.

In June 2018, a jury awarded the families of 3 of the company's patients $383 million in wrongful death claims after the patients died from cardiac arrest after undergoing treatment at DaVita centers.

In July 2021, a federal grand jury indicted DaVita and former CEO Kent Thiry on charges of labor market collusion alleging participation in conspiracies with Surgical Care Affiliates to suppress competition for the services of certain senior-level employees. The company and Thiry were acquitted by a jury in April 2022.
