## History

The history of central banking in Azerbaijan covers the periods of: the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918–1920); the Soviet socialist era (1920–1991); modern banking history since Azerbaijan regained independence in 1991.

In the early 20th century, Azerbaijan declared its independence and established the Azerbaijan People’s Republic on 28 May 1918. Initially, Transcaucasian bonds were widely used in the independent republic along with Russian money and Baku bonds, issued to circulation by the Baku City Administration and the Municipal service of the Baku Soviet in January 1918 at the decision of the Baku Council of People’s Commissars. At the same time, the Baku branch of the former State Bank of Russia also continued its activity. The Government of the Azerbaijan People's Republic took a decision on the establishment of the Azerbaijan State Bank (central bank) on 7 March 1919. On 16 September of the same year, the Parliament of the Azerbaijan People's Republic adopted the Charter of the Azerbaijan State Bank and the Bank started functioning with the solemn opening ceremony on 30 September 1919.

After the collapse of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on 28 April 1920, the Azerbaijan State Bank was renamed the Azerbaijan People’s Bank at the order of the Finance Commissariat of the new state structure – the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on 31 May 1920. At the decision of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan dated 9 June 1920, all banks and other credit institutions were nationalized and subordinated to the People’s Bank. The banking business was under an exclusive monopoly of the state.

The basic function of the Azerbaijan People’s Bank was to issue banknotes. The People’s Bank, which was a part of Finance Commissariat, financed the national economy and was engaged in budgeting and budgetary forecasting. The People’s Bank halted lending and became an institution serving budget operations along with financial bodies.

A new economic policy at the end of 1921 necessitated the restoration of the central bank. The Azerbaijan State Bank was established by the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars of Azerbaijan dated 16 October 1921 with parallel adoption of its Charter.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

TSSR moved to a single monetary system at the Decree of the Board of Union of the TSSR of 10 January 1923, which terminated the emission activity of the Azerbaijan State Bank. By the decree of the Council of People’s Commissariat of Azerbaijan dated 3 July 1923, the Azerbaijan State Bank was renamed the Azerbaijan State Agricultural Bank and its central banking functions were terminated.
