Defense industry of Serbia


# Defense industry of Serbia




The **defense industry of Serbia** is the largest in the Western Balkans. Serbia's export of weapons and military equipment in 2021 was valued at $1.23 billion (€1.13 billion). It consists of around 200 companies, both public and private, working in many different fields.
Serbian defense companies closely cooperate with the Military Technical Institute, country's top-level military scientific research institution, in developing new weapons, as well as with Serbian Armed Forces' Technical Testing Center, using its services for testing of new defense products. Universities and colleges in Serbia also participate through various contracts with the companies.


## Legal framework

All Serbian manufacturers of defense equipment must abide to the Law on Manufacturing and Sale of Weapons and Defense equipment. There is a special permission for manufacturing defense material and manufacturers must meet many criteria in order to get a permit for manufacturing. There is also a special registry that all companies have to apply to in order to obtain permits for import or export defense products; as of 2018, 219 companies were registered for arms import-export.


## Education

There are several universities that have proper defense industry study programs, such as:

* Faculty of Mechanical engineering, University of Belgrade
 + Department for Military Engineering
 + Department for Aerospace
* Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac
 + Department for Military Industrial Engineering
* Military Academy of University of Defence
