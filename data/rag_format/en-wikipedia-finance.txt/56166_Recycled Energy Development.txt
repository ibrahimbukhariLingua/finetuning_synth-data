Recycled Energy Development


# Recycled Energy Development



**Recycled Energy Development, LLC (RED)** aims to profitably reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and recycling waste energy, especially through cogeneration and waste heat recovery.


## Overview

RED develops, owns, and manages energy recycling facilities. These facilities take energy that’s normally wasted and convert it into electricity and thermal power for manufacturers, universities, hospitals, and other large institutions. Energy recycling is considered a form of “decentralized” energy because it takes place on site at such institutions rather than at large, remote power plants that serve entire regions.

The company’s goal is to cut global warming pollution and energy costs simultaneously, thereby providing an economical approach to mitigating climate change. The company’s work has been featured in media outlets such as Forbes, Nature, the Atlantic, and National Public Radio.
