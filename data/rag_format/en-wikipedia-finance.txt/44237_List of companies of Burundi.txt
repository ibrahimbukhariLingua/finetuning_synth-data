List of companies of Burundi


# List of companies of Burundi



The Republic of Burundi is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of Southeast Africa.

During the colonial period most large companies were owned and run by Europeans, and operated under concessions from the colonial government.
After independence in 1962, the state took over operations of several of the companies.
Subsequently the state founded a number of state-owned companies to handle specific sectors of the economy, such as sugar, cotton, textiles, cement, brewing and so on. Later, the state sold part or all of their stake in these companies, but retained the right to control the products or services they offered, and to set prices.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
