The Revenue Society


# The Revenue Society



**The Revenue Society** (originally *The Revenue Society of Great Britain*) was formed in 1990 and is the only international philatelic society which covers revenue stamps of the whole world. The society is also noted for the particularly high quality of its journal which has published many articles on subjects about which little or nothing has previously been written.

In 2007, the name of the society was shortened from *The Revenue Society of Great Britain* to just *The Revenue Society* in order to make the international nature of the society clear.


## Origins

The first committee meeting took place at the *East India Club* in London on 3 March 1990 and the first open meeting followed on 10 May 1990. Founder members included Robson Lowe, Gary Ryan, Clive Akerman and Ronald Butler.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

There had previously been no revenue stamp society in the UK since the Fiscal Philatelic Society ceased to exist in 1928 and the only similar society in existence was *The American Revenue Association*. A revival of interest in revenue stamps had started since Robson Lowe began specific revenue auctions in the 1970s and the founder members of the society felt that the time was ripe for an organisation devoted just to revenues.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
