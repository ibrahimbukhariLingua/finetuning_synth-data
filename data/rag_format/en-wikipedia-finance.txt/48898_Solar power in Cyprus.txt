Solar power in Cyprus


# Solar power in Cyprus



**Solar power in Cyprus** benefits from over 3,300 hours of sunlight annually, giving it the highest potential in the European Union (EU).

The 2023 IRENA Energy Profile for Cyprus highlights the increasing significance of solar energy in the country's renewable energy mix. In 2021, solar power generation amounted to 468 GWh, representing 9% of the total energy generated that year. Given that renewables constituted 15% of the total energy generated in 2021, equivalent to 775 GWh, solar energy's contribution is noteworthy within the renewable energy sector.

In Cyprus, photovoltaic (PV) technology plays a significant role in the country's renewable energy initiatives. Through programs like net metering, self-consumption schemes, and net billing for industry, the country has facilitated the installation of over 17,000 PV systems, contributing to a total production exceeding 65 MW, as reported by the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce.


## Solar targets

In 2011, the Cypriot target of solar power, including both photovoltaics and concentrated solar power, was a combined 7% of electricity by 2020.

While Cyprus saw a 16% increase in solar panel installations in a 2021 report, the country still grapples with low renewable energy usage, standing at 13.8%, compared to the EU average of 19.7% in 2019.

The 2021 Energy Resource Guide from the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce outlines Cyprus's active expansion of solar energy to mitigate carbon emissions and meet EU targets. Currently, Cyprus has 125 MW of solar power capacity. The country aims to increase total renewable energy penetration in the electricity sector to 700-750 MW by 2023, primarily through solar power initiatives. Efforts include promoting electric vehicles (EVs) via charging infrastructure and encouraging solar adoption through programs like net metering and self-consumption.


## Solar projects

In July 2023, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Cyprus announced a study for a bicommunal solar power plant in Cyprus, with funding from the EU. Managed by the UNDP and supported by the EU, the study aims to enhance cooperation between the island's communities and align with the European Green Deal. It will assess technical, regulatory, environmental, economic, and financial aspects to identify suitable locations for a 30-50 MW solar plant.
