# Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics



**Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics** (**CMFB**) is an advisory committee for the European Commission (Eurostat) and European Central Bank for cooperation between the statistical and central banking community in the Europe Union.


## History

The CMFB was originally established in 1991.

It was designed so that the European Commission, on its own initiative, and, should the occasion arise, following a request from the Council or from the committees, could consult the Committee on:

* the establishment of multiannual Community programmes for monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics;
* the measures which the Commission intends to undertake to achieve the objectives referred to in the multiannual programmes for monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics and the resources and timetables involved;
* any other question, in particular questions of methodology, arising from the establishment or implementation of the Statistical Programme in the relevant fields.

The Committee may express opinions on its own initiative on any questions relating to the establishment or the implementation of statistical programmes in the monetary, financial and balance of payments fields.

## Quality in the EU's macroeconomic imbalance procedure

The CMFB's role in ensuring the quality of statistics underlying the EU's Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure (MIP) is to make sure there are sound and harmonised official statistics.

The (ECOFIN) Council of the European Union, in its 2015 conclusions on EU statistics, recalled that the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure must rely upon such statistics. The Council welcomed the close cooperation of the European Statistical System (ESS) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), using existing fora, in ensuring the reliability of the statistics underlying the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure (MIP) and their comparability, welcomed the production of the first ESS-ESCB quality report on MIP statistics and encouraged the two statistical systems to give high priority to taking forward this programme.

As the statistics underlying MIP indicators are compiled, depending on domain, either or both by both the European Statistical System (ESS) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) within their respective spheres of competence, the two systems continuously cooperate statistical quality assurance mechanisms to ensure that these statistics are reliable and comparable across Member States. According to the Memorandum of Understanding between the ESS and the ESCB, the Committee on monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics (CMFB) is the operational platform for such cooperation.

The CMFB, starting 2013, developed a three level quality assurance framework for the statistics underlying the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure and published the related quality reports (Quality reports concerning statistics underlying the MIP indicators).
