# EW Group



The **EW Group GmbH** (also known as the Erich Wesjohann Group), headquartered in Visbek, Germany, is a global family owned holding, which integrates more than 300 active subsidiaries.

The management board comprises the founder, Erich Wesjohann, his sons, Dirk and Jan Wesjohann, as well as Albert Cordts.


## History


### Origin

The origins of the EW Group can be traced back to the "Lohmann-Wesjohann Group," which included companies operating in breeding, animal feed and pharmaceuticals and was managed by Paul Wesjohann and Heinz Lohmann. Paul Wesjohann's two sons, Paul-Heinz and Erich Wesjohann, were also active within the business. In 1997, both brothers acquired full ownership of the company shares.

In 1998, the group was split up. This resulted in the current EW Group (Erich Wesjohann Group) and the PHW Group (Paul-Heinz Wesjohann Group), in 1999. As part of the split, Erich Wesjohann took over the poultry breeding, mushroom breeding and grain trading sectors, while Paul-Heinz Wesjohann assumed control of the slaughtering operations as well as the animal nutrition and pharmaceutical divisions.

In 2006, Erich Wesjohann renamed the group from Erich Wesjohann GmbH & Co. KG to EW Group GmbH.


### Since 2005: Expansion in Poultry and Layer Breeding

In 2005, the EW Group acquired Aviagen (Aviagen International Group Inc.), the world leader in broiler breeding. In 2010, it was announced that the EW Group would acquire the “Peterson Male” broiler breeder genetic line from Peterson Farms in Decatur, USA. This was integrated into Aviagen, a subsidiary operating 500 locations worldwide and employing around 10,000 people. In 2006, Aviagen Turkeys was also acquired. This leading global turkey breeding company and the only player with independent breeding programs on two continents, was created from the merger of British United Turkeys (B.U.T.) and Nicholas Turkey Breeding Farms

Agri Advanced Technologies GmbH (AAT) was founded in 2015. The main field of activity of AAT is the development of specialized application technologies for poultry breeding and husbandry, for example machines for in ovo sex determination of layers, grading and vaccination devices for broiler breeders or technical solutions for feed and egg disinfection. In August 2017, the EW Group announced its acquisition of the broiler breeding company Hubbard Breeders from Groupe Grimaud, which was integrated into the Aviagen Group in 2018. In 2022, the EW Group acquired the French layer breeding company Novogen SAS and its Dutch distribution partner Verbeek.


### Since 2008: Expansion in Fish Breeding

In 2008, the EW Group acquired a majority stake in AquaGen, an international salmon breeding company based in Norway. By August 2013, AquaGen became a 100% subsidiary of the EW Group. In 2017, the EW Group acquired GenoMar (Norway). AquaGen invested in Brazil in 2016 through the acquisition of farmer Aquabel and in 2020, AquaAmerica / AquaPorto (Brazil), both companies specialize in tilapia breeding.

## Criticism

Animal welfare organizations have criticized that the breed *Ross* is so fast-growing that their hearts and bone structures are compromised, leading to a higher mortality, lameness and muscle disease.

The subsidiary *Lohmann Tierzucht* (since 2020 named *Lohmann Breeders*) was legally convicted of animal cruelty in 2011.
