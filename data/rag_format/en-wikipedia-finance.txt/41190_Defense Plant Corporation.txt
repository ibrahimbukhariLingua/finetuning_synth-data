Defense Plant Corporation


# Defense Plant Corporation



The **Defense Plant Corporation** (**DPC**), was an American subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government corporation run by the United States federal government between 1940 and 1945. To win World War II the United States and its Allied Nations needed massive war production. Many private companies did not have the capital funds to meet the wartime demand for buildings and equipment.

Defense Plant Corporation provided financial support to state and local governments. Defense Plant Corporation also made loans to banks, railroads, mortgage associations, and other businesses supporting the war efforts.

Fund requests usually started with the United States Navy, United States Army, War Shipping Administration, Office of Production Management, the War Production Board, Maritime Commission or other war departments. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation had eight subsidiaries. Most requests for new factories and new mills were given to the Defense Plant Corporation. The head of the Defense Plant Corporation was Jesse H. Jones, with Emil Schram and Sam Husbands. It would also offer oversight that factories were constructed, equipped, and operated.
