## Biography

Peter Lam Kin Ngok was born in 1957 in Hong Kong to Teochew parents. He is the son of the industrialist tycoon Lim Por-yen and his second wife, U Po-Chu. He has two brothers, Lam Kin Ming and Lam King Hong. At the age of thirteen, he was sent to Canada for four years of high school at St. George's School, after which he attended the University of Oregon where he graduated in 1987. After his graduation, he returned to Hong Kong to help his father, eventually becoming the vice-chairman of Lai Sun Group.

In 1997, Lam purchased Furama Hotel for HK$6.9 billion to rebuild it even though the idea was strongly opposed by his father Lim Por-yen. It was during that time the Asian economic crisis struck and the property market nose-dived, forcing Lai Sun Group to borrow money from banks, putting them 100 billion Hong Kong dollars in debt.

After this experience, Lam put more focus on his entertainment business. The first step to him becoming an entertainment magnate came in 2002, when the movie produced by his company, Infernal Affairs, enjoyed huge success. In 2004, Lam and Hong Kong singer Leon Lai started a music group, Amusic, which recruited famous Hong Kong singers.

In 2009, Lam supported Sharon Cheung with starting a free movie website, Goyeah.com. This was the first time in Hong Kong that movies were shared online for free. The website's main revenue is from ads.

In 2011, Lam was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, recognising his contribution to the music & film industries and support to the academy.

On February 22, 2013, the Hong Kong SAR government announced the appointment of Lam as the new chairman of Hong Kong Tourism Board, replacing James Tien. In the same year, Lam was elected by members to the standing committee of the Twelfth CPPCC National Committee.

In December 2021, it was reported that Lam was eligible to vote four times in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election, yielding 0.0366618% of the total voting value (elected seats), which is 7377 times more than the value of an average voter's total voting value.
