## Research

Pepall has conducted research on microeconomics related subjects, focusing especially on industrial organization. She studied first mover advantages and the optimal strategies of the first entrant in a case of sequential entry in a new product market. She explored introductory price strategies and brand loyalty as new market entry strategies and the impact of a brand stretching entry strategy.

Pepall has investigated optimal patent policy to promote innovation when rivals may imitate new products, and early on explored the impact of product quality and social welfare in the case of competition by imitation.

Pepall conducted research on Cournot firms' competition in spatially different markets and focused on the profitability and locational effects of mergers. Her study indicated two-firm merger to be profitable due to easy coordination in locational decisions. She also highlighted further advantages of two-firm mergers and on the welfare effects of mergers in both vertically differentiated and horizontally-differentiated markets, including health-care markets.

In her paper in early 2000s, Pepall discussed a model, having brand identity as a complementary part, for the analysis of brand stretching. She highlighted the characteristics of the brand stretching entry strategy as implied by her work.

Pepall conducted research on differentiated downstream market and specialized upstream market and analyzed various types of vertical relation between the two market sectors along with identifying different benchmarks regarding the study. Degree of product differentiation in the downstream firms was found to be the key factor influencing prices and profitability of various market organizations.

In the late 2000s, Pepall researched on advertising decisions regarding a homogeneous product and presented how various approaches to model the mechanism through which advertising affected demand, might lead to inefficiently low advertising. She introduced a model that provided an explanation for the fluctuation of advertising intensity with regard to the concentration.
