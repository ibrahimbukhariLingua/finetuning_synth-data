RuPay


# RuPay



**RuPay** (portmanteau of **Rup**ee and **Pay**ment) is an Indian multinational financial services and payment service system, conceived and owned by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It was launched in 2012, to fulfil the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) vision of establishing a domestic, open and multilateral system of payments. RuPay facilitates electronic payments at almost all Indian banks and financial institutions. NPCI has partnered with Discover Financial and JCB to help the RuPay network gain international acceptance.

As of November 2020, around 75.3 crores (750.3 million) RuPay cards have been issued by nearly 1,158 banks. All merchant discount rate (MDR) charges were eliminated for transactions done using Rupay debit cards from 1 January 2020. All Indian companies with an annual turnover exceeding ₹50 crore (US$5.8 million) are required to offer RuPay debit card and Unified Payments Interface as a payment option to their customers.


## Background

In 2009, RBI asked the Indian Banks' Association to create a non-profit payment company which would design an indigenous payment card. The card was tentatively called "India Pay". After years of planning, NPCI was entrusted with its implementation and finalised the name of the proposed card as RuPay, a portmanteau of the words rupee and *pay*ment to avoid naming conflicts with other financial institutions using the same name. The colours used in the logo allude to the tricolour flag of India. NPCI conceived RuPay as an alternative to Mastercard and Visa, while consolidating and integrating various payment systems in India.

RBI, in a Vision Document titled "Payment Systems in India - Vision 2009-12", had previously expressed the need for an Indian payments system. It arose from the absence of a domestic price setter, which caused Indian banks to bear high costs for affiliation and connection with international payment systems like Visa and Mastercard. Partnerships with these foreign companies meant that all transactions, of which domestic payments accounted for more than 90%, needed to be routed through a switch located outside the country.

RuPay was launched in and dedicated to India on 8 May 2014, by the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, at Rashtrapati Bhavan. NPCI launched a subsidiary called NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) on 19 August 2020 to increase the globalisation and availability of RuPay in foreign markets. As of March 2021, the market share of RuPay in India was at 34% was volume of transactions and at 30% by value.

On 14 December 2021, the Government of India approved a ₹1,300 crore ($170 million) package to promote RuPay among marginalised sections of the population.

Mastercard and Visa have raised concerns with the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) over India promoting the use of RuPay.


### Internationalisation

Around 77.7 crore (777 million) Indian consumers shopped cross-border in 2021. To make payments easier, NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with UK-based PPRO Financial on 17 November 2021 to expand the acceptance of RuPay in foreign markets, especially in China and United States, which account for half of all international transactions coming from India.

Under its Payments Vision 2025, RBI aimed to further push for the internationalization of RuPay, with countries using the United States dollar, Pound sterling and Euro under bilateral treaties.

NIPL signed a definitive agreement with PPRO Financial on 27 April 2023 that will enable acceptance of UPI among international payment service providers (PSPs) and global merchant acquirers.


## Products

RuPay offers debit cards, credit cards, prepaid cards and government scheme cards. Government scheme cards include debit and credit cards, such as the RuPay PMJDY, RuPay Mudra and RuPay PunGrain debit cards, and the RuPay Kisan credit card. It also offers combo cards that offer debit and credit, debit and prepaid, or credit and prepaid features through a single card.


### Debit cards

RuPay issues debit cards in three variants – Classic, Platinum and Select. Classic is the standard variant, and a basic RuPay-branded card which offers minimum features such as acceptance at almost all merchants in India, and some offers in categories like dining, travel, pharmacy, lifestyle, cosmetics, retails, shopping, and jewelry. It does not offer benefits such as airport lounge access. Platinum is RuPay's middle tier offering, providing all the features of Classic, plus more offers and benefits such as airport lounge access, comprehensive insurance coverage of up to ₹2,00,000 and various other merchant offers.

In 2020, NPCI launched the RuPay Select card, in a bid to target more affluent customers. It is the most premium variant of a card issued by RuPay. The card is independent of its issuing bank, forming partnerships with various businesses to provide card-specific benefits. Under Rupay Select, all benefits are curated under one package, independent of bank partnerships, saving customers the hassle of applying for multiple card schemes. RuPay Select allows NPCI to capture a share of the high-spending customer market and provide an Indian alternative against premium offerings from Mastercard, Visa etc.

As of July 2018, RuPay cards have been issued by most banks across India. Apart from the main private-sector and public-sector banks, RuPay cards are also issued by cooperative banks (scheduled cooperative banks, district cooperative banks, state cooperative banks, urban cooperative banks) and regional rural banks (RRBs) in the country.


### Credit cards

Similar to RuPay debit cards, RuPay credit cards are available in three variants – RuPay Classic, RuPay Platinum and RuPay Select. RuPay credit cards have been in operation since June 2017, with eight public sector banks, one private sector bank and one cooperative bank issuing the card without any formal launch. A pilot project was implemented to technically enable more banks in RuPay credit cards with an additional five public sector banks. By March 2018, NPCI plans to have 25 banks altogether on board.

More than 18 banks have launched RuPay credit cards:

* Axis Bank
* AU Small Finance Bank
* HDFC Bank
* IDBI Bank
* United Bank of India
* Union Bank of India
* Punjab National Bank
* Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank

* Canara Bank
* Central Bank of India
* Vijaya Bank
* Bank of India

In 2021, Fiserve with NPCI launched a stack of services called nFiNi, that will help Indian banks improve the quality of services for RuPay credit cards. In September 2021, Union Bank of India (UBI) launched a RuPay and JCB co-branded international credit card.

NPCI, in collaboration with Kotak Mahindra Bank, launched specially designed RuPay credit cards for the Indian Armed Forces on 28 October 2021. BOB Financial and NPCI partnered to launch Bank of Baroda RuPay and JCB co-branded international credit card on 16 November 2021.

During the 2021 Digital Payment Utsav, India Post Payments Bank, Punjab National Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, YES Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, ICICI Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, and City Union Bank launched contactless credit cards on the RuPay network.

From 8 June 2022, RBI allowed the linking of RuPay credit cards with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI). In the absence of a physical card, customers can use their credit limit through for transactions. The service was officially launched on 20 September 2022, and was a game changer, helping Rupay increase their market share. For the first time, RuPay credit card usage topped ₹10,000 crore in a single month in December 2023, accounting for roughly 6% of the domestic credit card market. The number of RuPay credit cards in use surpassed 10 million in December 2023.

On 1 August 2024, RBL Bank announced integration of National Common Mobility Card and UPI capabilities with RuPay credit cards.

### RuPay Global

The NPCI started issuing global cards in 2014. Singapore has since offered assistance to promote India's digital payment network RuPay card overseas by becoming its first international partner. On 7 March 2012, NPCI entered into a strategic partnership with Discover Financial Services (DFS) for RuPay, enabling RuPay Global Cards to utilise Discover, Diners Club International and PULSE networks for international purchases and cash access outside of India. Both companies also worked to implement D-PAS, Discover's EMV technology to offer chip-based cards to RuPay card members. The cards are now accepted by over 42.4 million POS terminals and 1.90 million ATMs in 185 countries.

NPCI, with JCB launched the RuPay-JCB Global card on 22 July 2019. After extending domestic POS terminal and ATM support for incoming foreign JCB card holders in 2017, NPCI entered into the second phase of its partnership with the launch of the co-branded card to further increase the international acceptance of RuPay. The card will offer special cashback programmes for POS transactions outside India, in addition to selected popular international destinations for travellers. It will support additional services such as in-city JCB Lounges located in airports with round the year merchant promotions all over the world. While debit cards are only being issued initially through the partnership, credit and prepaid cards are also on the anvil.

RuPay issued 64 million Global Cards between 2014 and March 2019. RuPay has tied up with international players like Discover, Japan Credit Bureau and China Union Pay to enhance its international acceptance and recently achieved the milestone of issuing 25 million RuPay – Discover global cards.

## Technology


### RuPay Contactless

RuPay Contactless is a contactless payment technology feature that allows cardholders to wave their card in front of contactless payment terminals without the need to physically swipe or insert the card into a point-of-sale device. This is an EMV-compatible, contactless payment feature similar to Mastercard Contactless, Visa Contactless, and ExpressPay which use RFID technology.

The National Payments Corporation of India's (NPCI) card network RuPay has launched a contactless prepaid NFC card. It launched the contactless card for the Ahmedabad Smart city project in association with ICICI Bank and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. It also launched similar prepaid contactless cards for the Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) in association with Axis Bank.

Contactless can currently be used on transactions up to and including ₹2000. In March 2019 under ‘One Nation, One Card’ scheme a National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) for transportation was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a function in Ahmedabad on RuPay platform in order to avoid vendor lock-in and create an interoperable system under Make in India.

This is the latest development in the forward movement of the Interoperable Fare Management System. The main aim behind the card is to redefine payment for public transport systems and retail ease of access, at the cutting edge of digital payments. The project is under the purview of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, with the vision "One Card for all payments". With this theme, the card needed to be accepted across multiple verticals. It then made sense to take up a card which is gaining a significant amount of adoption in the contactless payment space. The specifications for the NCMC programme are with the government and it is not owned by any specific body, hence all card payment schemes are welcome to join the programme.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are set to become the first public transportation in India to roll out the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC). The one nation, one card system will initially be implemented on a pilot basis from November 2019 and will be available widely only from 2020. More than 10,000 BEST conductors will be given the hand-held devices that would be able to scan the NCMC cards with just one tap, alongside generating paper tickets.

Visa is ready with the specifications to start issuing cards on the NCMC network and has started discussions with banks to issue their cards on NCMC as well, but it will take some time for the cards to start getting rolled out in the market. Just weeks after its biggest competitor Visa, Mastercard set to join One Nation One Card project.

After discussions with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) confirmed the trial run from 1 January 2020 with four automatic fare collection (AFC) gates at Nadaprabhu, Kempegowda and Baiyyappanahalli stations. Passengers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses and Metro trains on the Majestic-Whitefield route will be able to use the card. Existing AFC gates at Phase 1 metro stations will have to be upgraded while AFC gates at Phase 2 metro stations operational by 2024 will accept new cards. Around 11,000 old electronic ticketing machines will be replaced with new android-based ones of which around 2,000 have already been changed to accept the card.

The State Bank of India (SBI) in collaboration with Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) launched SBI-IRCTC RuPay contactless card on 28 July 2020 to reward frequent railway travellers in India with the proposal of maximum savings during the journey period. The card uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology and can be used by the railway travellers for benefits on retail, dining and entertainment besides transaction fee waivers.

On 25 March 2023, NCMC was officially launched in Bengaluru. From 30 March 2023, RBL Bank and Namma Metro started issuing the cards.


#### RuPay On-the-Go

NPCI on the eve of Global Fintech Festival 2021 launched RuPay On-the-Go interoperable, open-loop contactless solution that are made available on smartwatch and other personal electronic accessories eliminating the need to carry physical card.

A partnership between NPCI and the TATA for 2024 Indian Premier League has been launched. A limited number of guests will be able to purchase a special wristband and other items for the playoffs and final. The special wristband will be from "RuPay On-The-Go" series. The gadget will serve as a contactless payment method after the cricketing event in addition to providing seamless access control during the event.

At the **Global Fintech Fest 2024**, Airtel Payments Bank, in collaboration with Noise and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), launched a smartwatch that incorporates RuPay chip embedded in the dial, enabling direct payments. Tap-and-pay transactions are made easier by the smartwatch's support for National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) technology. Users can pay at a variety of retail sites and public transportation hubs, including as bus stops, metro stations, and parking lots. Users may choose between contactless purchases and monthly passes on the device, as well as handle transportation concessions. A PIN is required to conduct transactions over ₹5,000, whereas transactions under this amount can be performed without one.


### NPCI Tokenisation System

In view of RBI guidelines on card payment, NPCI on 21 October 2021 launched Token Reference On File (TROF) service that will help keep RuPay card details into RuPay Network Secure Vault. This will help share unique token reference ID number instead of actual card details between customers, merchants and banks for transactions and stop identity theft and hacks.

On 6 December 2021, PayPhi became the first digital payment platform in the country to officially certified for RuPay Tokenisation System.


### BharatQR

This is developed by NPCI in collaboration with Mastercard, and Visa as an integrated interoperable QR code based payment system and was launched in September 2016. It facilitates users to transfer their money from one source to another without the need of physical cards. The money transferred through BharatQR is received directly in the user's linked bank account using IMPS. It provides a common interface between RuPay, Mastercard, Visa, American Express as opposed to other such individual proprietary systems. BharatQR is supported on both Android and iOS devices. Bijlipay, an end to end digital payment solutions company, is the first Indian Point-of-Sale (PoS) devices providing company to enable Bharat QR code on the screens of its POS machines. According to RBI, the Bharat QR Code is the world's first inter-operable payment acceptance solution.


#### Recurring Payment

RuPay Card is expected to roll out recurring payments without the two-factor authentication process for transactions of less than ₹2,000 during first quarter of 2020, as per National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) chief operating officer (COO) Praveena Rai.

The RMA maintains an account with the State Bank of India. Any withdrawal by a RuPay card holder in Bhutan would be settled through an instant credit into the RMA's account.

## Market share

RuPay's parent organisation, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), has been backed by 10 leading banks. Of these are 6 public-sector banks: State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, and Bank of India; 2 private-sector banks: ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank; and 2 foreign banks: Citibank and HSBC. Banks in India are authorised to issue RuPay debit cards to their customers for use at ATMs, PoS terminals, and e-commerce websites. RuPay's market share rose from 0.6% in 2013 to 50% by November 2018. A total of 628.41 million RuPay cards had been issued across all categories including prepaid, debit, credit, and commercial cards as of February 2021.

RuPay initially charged transaction processing fees that are approximately 23% lower than those charged by Visa and Mastercard. The NPCI charged a flat-fee per transaction of 60 paise from acquiring bank and 30 paise from the card issuing bank. For example, if a customer made a transaction with their RuPay card at a POS terminal operated by another bank, then the customer's bank (the bank that issued the card) would pay 30 paise to the NPCI while the bank that operates the POS terminal (the acquiring bank) would pay 60 paise to the NPCI. All merchant discount rate (MDR) charges were eliminated for RuPay transactions from 1 January 2020.

RuPay surpassed Visa as the largest payment card network in India by number of transactions in June 2017, recording 375 million (37.5 Crores) transactions. According to NPCI data released in May 2019, 112.7 Crore transactions (1.127 billion) valued at ₹1.174 Lakh Crores (US$17 billion) were made on RuPay cards during the 2018–19 fiscal year. RuPay held 58% of the market share by number of cards issued, 30% by number of point of sale transactions, and 25% by number of online transactions from around 11% two years ago.

RuPay reported 100 Crore (1 billion) transactions through both online and offline merchant payment modes in financial year 2019, a nearly 70% jump compared to the 667 million (66.7 Crore) transactions in financial year 2018, according to data sourced from the NPCI and the Reserve Bank of India. In terms of value, RuPay cards noted a rise of 80% in FY ’19, beating overall debit card payments which grew 30% compared to the previous fiscal year. NPCI issued 59.1 Crore (591 million) RuPay cards till December 2019 of which 22.9 Crore (229 million) cards were used for ATM transactions and 10 Crore (100 million) on PoS terminals. RuPay card usage for both ATM and PoS transaction is topped by Maharashtra for the year 2019. During COVID-19 pandemic, consumer usage of RuPay platform in India was hovering at 87% to 98% by spending volume above its foreign competitors Mastercard and Visa, which were at 70% to 86% due to reduction in discretionary spending as of March 2020.

## Initiative for farmers

RuPay also provides a unified "Kisan card", issued by banks across the country as the Kisan Credit Card, enabling farmers to transact business on ATMs and PoS terminals.

PUNGRAIN (Punjab Grains Procurement Corporation Ltd) pays commission agents through the RuPay Debit Card and developed a commission agent network called the Kisan Arhtia Information and Remittance Online Network (KAIRON) with the help of the National Payments Corporation of India.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, in partnership with RuPay, rolled out an initiative for financial inclusion, where the dairy farmers across 75 cooperative societies of Amul in regions of Burdwan and Hooghly of West Bengal will be able to get their payments directly into their accounts on the same day as the sale of their milk.

The same model is planned to be adopted in the state of Gujarat where 1,200 cooperative societies comprising over 3 lakh dairy farmers will be the part of the programme.

In 2017 post demonetisation, the government decided that NABARD will co-ordinate the conversion of operative/live Kisaan Credit Cards into RuPay ATM cum Debit Kisaan Credit Cards by Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks on priority.
