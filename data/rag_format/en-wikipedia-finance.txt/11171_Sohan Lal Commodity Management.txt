## History

In 1995, Sandeep Sabharwal, an MBA graduate from the Fore School of Management in Delhi, joined Sohan Lal. In 2004, Sabharwal initiated his business by renting a warehouse in Lawrence Road, Delhi, and commenced the practice of providing farmers with bar-coded warehouse receipt. The reliability of this system is such that banks now consider a bar-coded receipt from Sohan Lal as a guarantee when farmers seek financial assistance. Sohan Lal Commodity Management has been contracted by companies such as Cargill, a US-based agricultural powerhouse, for the storage of agricultural commodities.

In March 2017, ResponsAbility Investments AG (Switzerland) and Incofin Investment Management (Belgium) invested $20 million in Sohan Lal Commodity Management (SLCM).
