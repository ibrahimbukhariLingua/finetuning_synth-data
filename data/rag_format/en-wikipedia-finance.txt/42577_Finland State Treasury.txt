## History

The State Treasury was established by an imperial decree for the management of state finances. Prior to the establishment of the State Treasury, these tasks were the responsibility of the Bank of Finland. Emperor Alexander II approved the establishment of the State Treasury on June 30, 1875. The operations of the Finnish State Treasury began on January 1, 1876.

The State Treasury was entrusted with state assets, from which it was to make state expenditures and invest any surplus profitably. From 1901 to 1932, and again from 1965 onwards, it was also responsible for the supervision, accounting, and financial statements of state cash transactions, which at other times belonged to auditing authorities.

Later, its responsibilities were expanded to include the management of state securities, state debt management, and lending and borrowing activities. Since 1959, it has also been responsible for paying pensions and burial aid from state funds.
