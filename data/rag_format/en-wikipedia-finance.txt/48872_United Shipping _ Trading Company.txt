## History

United Shipping & Trading Company was founded as Julius Mortensen Shipping in Fredericia in 1876. In 1974, the company acquired the local shipbroker H. Sommer in Middelfart. In 1978, Torben Østergaard-Nielsen, was appointed as new Managing Director of H. Sommer's Eftf. Shipping ApS and under his leadership the company diversified into bunker trading.

In 1981, Østergaard-Nielsen embarked on a process which has led to the transfer of bunker activities to independent subsidiaries around the world, now the backbone of Bunker Holding A/S.

In 1998, Torben Østergaard-Nielsen became sole owner of the USTC Group.

In 2013, USTC moved to its present head office, a fully restored turbine hall at Turbinevej in Middelfart.

In 2020, Torben Østergaard-Nielsen's two daughters became co-owners of the group. Nina Østergaard Borris and Mia Østergaard Rechnitzer each received a 1/3 of the ownership of Selfinvest, the USTC Group's parent company.

In 2022, a change in leadership took place, as Nina Østergaard Borris takes over as CEO of the USTC Group after her father, Mia Østergaard Rechnitzer assumes the role as Chief Governance Officer, and Torben Østergaard-Nielsen steps up as working Chairman of the Board of the USTC Group.
