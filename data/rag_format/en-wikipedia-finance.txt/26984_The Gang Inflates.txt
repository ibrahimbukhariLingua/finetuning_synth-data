## Plot

Inflation starts affecting the Gang: Mac (Rob McElhenney) and Dennis (Glenn Howerton) had to rent their sofa for the past fifteen years, while Dee (Kaitlin Olson) is getting evicted from her apartment. Frank (Danny DeVito) explains inflation, and how they need to spend less on their expenses.

As Frank tries to find solutions for their expenses, he is shocked to discover that Charlie (Charlie Day) never told him there was a bathroom in their apartment. This prompts him to open their other door, discovering that there is a whole empty bedroom that Charlie never mentioned. Mac and Dennis arrive with inflatable couches, wanting to partner in a new business with the inflation, convincing Frank to loan them money in exchange for interest. Charlie is mad at Frank, as he chose to invest in Mac and Dennis over his cryptocurrency strategy, although Frank states he is planning to get paid as he does not believe Mac and Dennis will succeed. Frank later reveals to Dee that he is her landlord and he got her kicked out of her apartment for the inflation.

Annoyed by the noise and Dee's presence in his apartment, Charlie leaves for Mac and Dennis' apartment, where Mac has been suffering allergies from eating cheap nuts. Charlie informs them of Frank's predatory lending scheme, so Dennis decides to change their strategy to rent the inflatable couches. The business proves to be fruitless, so Charlie uses all their money to buy the discontinued Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pie, angering Dennis. Frank tries to buy them from Charlie, but he refuses unless he returns everything to normal, including the loan, Dee's apartment and boarding up the new rooms in their apartment, which Frank reluctantly accepts. Mac's allergy worsens as he finishes the can of nuts, disgusting the Gang.

### Critical reviews

"The Gang Inflates" received very positive reviews from critics. Ross Bonaime of *Collider* wrote, "While 'The Gang Inflates' does do an admirable job of explaining inflation in a way that even Charlie can understand it, there's no real larger message with this concept. This certainly isn't a choice that damns the new season in any way, but considering the topics this season decides to explore, it is a bit unusual that the show doesn't attempt a grander point with these issues."

Emily Zemler of *The New York Observer* wrote, "It's a classic *Sunny* episode and a perfect way to begin a season, reminding viewers how clever the series can be when it takes on contemporary issues." Ray Flook of *Bleeding Cool* wrote, "Frank & Charlie's apartment actually has a bathroom and a second bedroom – and it's had it the entire time! After 15 seasons, I'm not sure what to do with that info… game-changer?"

Rendy Jones of *Paste* wrote, "With a newfound understanding of the current economic state, Mac and Dennis come up with an inflatable furniture scheme to get quick cash. Of course, it's only a short matter of time before matters become obscenely insane." Joel Keller of *Decider* wrote, "*Always Sunny* never changes, and that's a beautiful thing. The show can't go on forever, but it's a great thing that the gang can still get together and make us laugh."
