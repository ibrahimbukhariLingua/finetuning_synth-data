## Products and services


### Online ordering

Users can place orders online at www.delivery.com or download the mobile app for iOS or Android. To place an order, the user must first enter their address to find out what merchants are available for delivery or pickup. From there, they can add items to their “bag”, including food, alcohol, groceries, or laundry services like wash-and-fold, dry cleaning, or tailoring. Secure payment methods available to delivery.com users include credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Visa Checkout, or cash. They also have the option to leave a tip at the time of checkout.

As a marketplace platform, delivery.com does not make or prepare food, nor does it handle laundry or deliver any of the items sold. When a user places an order, the order details are automatically sent to the intended merchant; the merchant confirms receipt from delivery.com then prepares and delivers the order.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
