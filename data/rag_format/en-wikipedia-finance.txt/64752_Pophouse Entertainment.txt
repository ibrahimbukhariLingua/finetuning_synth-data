Per Sundin currently serves as the group's CEO.


## History

Pophouse Entertainment (also known as **Pophouse**) was established in 2014 in Stockholm, Sweden by Björn Ulvaeus, a founding member of the musical group ABBA, and Conni Jonsson, founder of EQT AB. Since 2019, the CEO of Pophouse is Per Sundin, who was previously CEO of Universal Music in the Nordics and was instrumental in the emergence of Spotify, as the first music label executive to partner with the streaming platform.

On 25 February 2022, the company opened the *Avicii Experience*, an interactive museum in Stockholm, and a tribute to Tim Bergling's music and life. The opening ceremony was inaugurated by the Swedish royal family.

In March 2022, Pophouse Entertainment acquired the master recordings of the band Swedish House Mafia.

In April 2022, Pophouse recruited James Mcknight, previously creative director of the Harry Potter franchise, as head of entertainment research and development, and also opened their first office in London.

In February 2024, Pophouse acquired the majority of Cyndi Lauper's music catalogue for new projects to promote her legacy.


## Funding and acquisitions

In September 2021, the company bought Perfect Day Media AB, a media house founded in 2011, that develops and produces podcasts for various media platforms.

In 2022, Pophouse announced they would move into music catalogue investments. According to Bloomberg, "Pophouse is raising a music fund with a target size of up to $1 billion USD, similar to that of Hipgnosis and Round Hill Music Royalty Fund. However, Pophouse has not yet confirmed that claim."

Pophouse was among the major developers of ABBA Voyage, a concert residency by the Swedish pop group ABBA. The concerts feature ABBA as virtual avatars (dubbed 'ABBAtars'), depicting the group as they appeared in 1979. The concerts are held in a purpose-built venue at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, officially called ABBA Arena.

In April 2024, it was reported that Pophouse has bought the hard rock band Kiss for $300 million, including all of their songs along with their brand and intellectual property.
