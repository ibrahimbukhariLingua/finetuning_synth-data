Real Estate Authority


# Real Estate Authority



The **Real Estate Authority (REA)**, formerly the Real Estate Agents Authority (REAA), is the New Zealand Crown entity responsible for the regulation of the New Zealand real estate industry as well as the agents within it.

The purpose of REA is to promote and protect the interests of consumers with respect to property transactions, and to promote confidence in real estate agency work. The organisation's strategic goal is to see empowered consumers working with trusted real estate professionals.

The agency was established in 2008 under the Real Estate Agents Act, 2008. It became functional on 17 November 2009. The Crown entity falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice.


## History

The Real Estate Agents Authority (REAA), now the Real Estate Authority (REA) was established in 2009, after the enactment of the Real Estate Agents Act in 2008. The organisation took control of, and maintained, the roles of the now-defunct Real Estate Agents Licensing Board

In February 2018, the organisation's operating name was changed from Real Estate Agents Authority to the Real Estate Authority. Also in February 2018, the REA launched settled.govt.nz, an independent and comprehensive government website for property buyers and sellers.

In 2011, REAA increased the operating levy from $494 per annum to $690 per annum, excluding GST.

In the period of 2011-2012, REAA introduced a continuing education programme whereby all licensee's are required to complete 20 hours of education, of which 10 hours are prescribed by directly by REA. In 2012, 11 licensees had their licences cancelled on the basis of non-completion of the 20 hours of education. The continuing education programme was replaced with a continuing professional development (CPD) programme in 2019.

During 2012-2013, REAA found 124 complaints were consistent with unsatisfactory conduct, down from 152 in the 2011-2012 financial period, and a further 16 determinations of serious misconduct, up from 14 in the previous financial period.

In the aftermath of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, the REAA temporarily moved its headquarters from Level 2, 10 Brandon Street, Wellington to Level 3, 3 The Terrace, Wellington. According to the 2016-2017 Annual Report, the reasoning for the headquarters relocation was due to Deloitte House, its former headquarters, being deemed unsafe. In the days following the decision, REAA instructed its workers to work from home until a suitable building is found for the interim headquarters. An interim headquarters was located on 5 December 2017, the current headquarters at 3 The Terrace, Wellington. REA then relocated to more permanent premises at 95 Customhouse Quay, Wellington.

In June 2020, REA announced the appointment of Belinda Moffat as its new Chief Executive, replacing Kevin Lampen-Smith who left in May.

## Notable cases

* On 3 March 2010, REAA, acting on the advice of an appointed CAC, censured North Shore-based Real Estate Agent Tip Spooner, then working for Milford's Prestige Real Estate International, for sending an elderly woman a business card and a valuation on her property not long after her husband's death. This act was deemed as a breach of REAA's Code of Professional Conduct and Client Care. This case was also the first censuring undertaken by REAA.
* On 27 April 2010, REAA, acting on the advice of an appointed CAC, found Auckland-based Real Estate Agent Lawrence Lalit Naidu, then working for Sega Realty, guilty of unsatisfactory conduct after charging a client over $5,000 more than what was previously agreed to. Due to the offence occurring prior to the enactment of the Real Estate Agents Act in 2008, the offence was punishable under the previous real estate governing act, the Real Estates Agents Act, 1976.
* On 20 August 2010, REAA ruled that North Shore-based Real Estate Agent Darryn Laskey, who was New Zealand's 4th best salesman at the time, was guilty of *"unsatisfactory conduct in his response to emails he felt attacked him"*. The CAC appointed to determine the case found that some comments made by the agent amounted to personal abuse, and that verdict led to the guilty ruling.
