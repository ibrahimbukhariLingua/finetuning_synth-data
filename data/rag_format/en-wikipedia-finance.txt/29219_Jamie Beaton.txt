According to Beaton, he then applied to 25 of the top universities in the world and received an offer from each.

He also earned two degrees from Stanford University and received a master's degree in global affairs from Tsinghua University in Beijing. In 2023, he received his Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.

As of 2016, the enterprise was valued at over NZ$75 million with Beaton being the largest shareholder. Crimson Education is mostly branded on Beaton, using him as a role model to prospective applicants to prestigious universities. Customers of Crimson Education have reported paying thousands of dollars for tutoring services when attempting to gain entry to an Ivy League school.

In 2021, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd joined the advisory board of the business. As of 2022ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the business had 630 full-time staff and more than 3,000 tutors and mentors.

In 2018, the University of Auckland filed a suit against a Crimson Education subsidiary, alleging breach of copyright. The suit was eventually settled.

In January 2021 it was reported that a $10-million High Court lawsuit had been filed by a competitor of Crimson involving allegations of employee poaching. Beaton had also filed a civil assault claim against the owner of that competitor. Crimson Education chose not to comment on the assault claim filed by Beaton. Crimson stated it was not unusual for companies like Crimson to "experience some commercial litigation". In May 2022, media reported that the parties reached a confidential settlement.


## Personal life and politics
