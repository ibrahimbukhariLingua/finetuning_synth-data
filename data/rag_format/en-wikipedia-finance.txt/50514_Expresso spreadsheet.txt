Expresso spreadsheet


# Expresso spreadsheet



**eXpresso** was a hosted workspace for Microsoft Office communities that became defunct in 2014. Excel spreadsheet management was the first application offered. It was among the growing number of Web 2.0, SaaS offerings in the online spreadsheet market. eXpresso served as a collaborative platform specifically for Excel business users, similar to Google Sheets, a competitor that ultimately outlasted eXpresso.


## History

Exploring Creative Possibilities prompted investors to present eXpresso as a standalone product. The free public beta release was introduced in August 2007.


## Subscriptions

Pricing was based on a subscription model which included a free version for light users or individuals. The user agreement showed that it is present in Version 1.0 beta. It had a 10 Mb space limit per user license without charge.
