The WTC Abuja, when completed, will be the largest mixed-use development on the West African subcontinent.


## Development

The development of World Trade Centre Abuja started in 2010, on a land size of over 6,000 hectares in the Central Business District of Abuja. The project was initially on a much lesser scale; at the conceptual stage of the project, two unsuccessful attempts were made at securing development partners before First Continental Properties Limited was secured in 2009 through a bid process which eventually led to a development-lease agreement with Abuja Investments Company Limited (ACIL). Along the line, the scope of the project was later expanded to a mega-multi-use complex, "which would be bustling throughout the day and night".

President Goodluck Jonathan broke ground for the project in September 2011, with an estimated completion and opening date initially scheduled for 2013. However, the date could not be kept due to several challenges in design, development and even during construction process of the project. The project has also undergone several redesign in order to meet the changing "market demands".

The complex is being funded by private financial institutions, as well as private investors, costing about ₦200 billion. it is being developed by *The churchgate Group*, a Nigerian real estate company, with Woods Bagot as the architect. Other partners and consultants of the project include: Abuja Investments Company who is a partner, WSP Consulting is the structural consultant, Edifice Consultants PVT Limited is the executive architect, as well as MEP Consultant. Others are: Messrs Hancock Ogundiya & Partners, Local MEP & C&S Consultants, while Space Designers Limited is the Local Architectural Consultant.


## Architecture and design

The glass cladding and aluminum ceilings used for the buildings in World Trade Centre are heat-resistant, sound-proof and also are not flammable. The buildings employ VRV air conditioning systems. The centre also has an advanced CCTV security and employs a controlled Card access in all areas. There are three levels of basement parking in the complex. The curtain wall system employed by the building was installed by Eurotech Facades.


## Structures

Six towers, a mall, and a hotel are to eventually occupy the World Trade Centre Abuja; As of 2015, towers 1 and 2 have been topped out, whilst the other buildings are in different stages of development.

## 2014 crane collapse

In November 2014, one of the construction cranes for WTC Tower 2 buckled after a prolonged heavy rainfall, damaging a substantial area of the glass cladding as a result. It was deduced that the crane fell due to impact of thunder storm. No casualty was recorded, as the incident took place when there was no work going on in the building, however, the damage affected the completion date of the project, which had been scheduled for June 2015.
