# Nikkei Asia



***Nikkei Asia***, known as ***Nikkei Asian Review*** between 2013 and 2020, is a major Japan-based English-language weekly news magazine focused on the Asian continent, although it also covers broader international developments. It is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and was originally launched in 2013.


## Ownership

*Nikkei Asia* is owned by Nikkei, Inc., the same Japan-based holding company that also owns the London-based *Financial Times*. Because *Nikkei Asia* and the *Financial Times* are sister publications, some *Financial Times* journalists are seconded to *Nikkei Asia* on a rotating, two-year basis.

*Nikkei Asia* calls itself the "voice of the Asian century".
