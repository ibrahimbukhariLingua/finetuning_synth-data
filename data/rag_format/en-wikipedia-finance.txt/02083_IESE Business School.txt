IESE Business School


# IESE Business School



**IESE Business School** is a Catholic graduate business school of the University of Navarra. It was established in Barcelona in 1958 by Opus Dei. From 1963, in collaboration with Harvard Business School, it offers a two-year Master of Business Administration degree, an executive MBA, and executive education courses. It has other campuses in Madrid, Munich, New York City, Lisbon and São Paulo.


## History

The *Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa* (IESE) was created by Opus Dei in 1958. The first name of IESE was *Centro de Estudios de la Empresa*, then *Escuela de Directores del Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa* (IESE) and finally IESE Business School.

Antonio Valero Vicente, commissioned by Jose María Escriva de Balaguer, was its main promoter and first dean. The founder of Opus Dei had listened to businessmen from Madrid, the Basque Country and Catalonia who, led by the Madrid naval engineer Alejandro Crespo Calabria, had expressed their concern and desire for the education and training of business leaders with a Christian vision. Valero visited the École des Administrations des Affaires de Lille, run by an MBA from Harvard Business School (HBS), to get advice on the pedagogical model, the case method.

IESE launched its first training project for entrepreneurs during the 1958-59 academic year. The first program, called *Programa de Alta Dirección de Empresas* (PADE), was aimed at business leaders with a decade of experience in senior management. The first classes were held at the Hotel del Parque in Sant Andreu de Llavaneres. The following academic programmes were *Programa de Dirección de Empresas* (PDE) 1959–1960, and *Programa de Desarrollo para Alta Dirección de Empresas* (PDADE, later known as PDG) in 1961. In 1963, after consulting professors Ralph M. Hower and Steve Fuller, the Harvard-IESE Committee was set up, and IESE launched the Master in Business Administration and Economics (MED) in 1964. It was the first time the term "master's" was used in Europe; it later took on the standardized name of MBA.

After almost two decades of collaboration with Harvard, the bilingual Spanish-English MBA was introduced in 1980, and collaboration was extended to other North American universities such as the University of Michigan Business School and the MIT Sloan School of Management (1994). In 2001, the Global Executive MBA was established. At the same time, IESE developed in-company programmes for transnational companies in Spain and leading Spanish companies.In 2006, IESE launched an Advanced Management Programme (AMP) for senior managers in Poland, which has been running annually since then.In 2007, after expansion and renovation, the new Barcelona campus was inaugurated. In 2009, the Global CEO Program for Latin America was launched in partnership with CEIBS and Wharton.

In the following years, the campuses in New York City (2010), Munich (2015), and São Paulo (in collaboration with IESE Business School), were consolidated and opened. In 2021, the expansion and opening of the new Madrid campus was completed.

In 2021, the Institute for Sustainability Leadership (ISL) was established to foster cooperation between academia and business. ISL researches and measures environmental targets, governance systems for sustainable cities and financial instruments for their development.
