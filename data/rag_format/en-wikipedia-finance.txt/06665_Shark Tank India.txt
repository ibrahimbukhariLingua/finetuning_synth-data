## Concept

The show features a panel of potential investors or angel investors, termed as "Sharks", who listen to entrepreneurs' pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. These self-made multi-millionaires judge the business concepts and products pitched and then decide whether to invest their money to help market and mentor each contestant.
