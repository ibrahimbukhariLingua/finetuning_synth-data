# Programmes internationaux d'échanges



**Programmes Internationaux d’Echanges** (PIE) is a French non-profit organisation, founded in 1981 that aims to promote international education and knowledge through the organisation of international exchange and au pair programs.

The aim of the organisation is to enable French students to live abroad with a host family, and study at a foreign school. In the same way, the organisation enables French families to host foreign students of all nationalities.


## The organisation
