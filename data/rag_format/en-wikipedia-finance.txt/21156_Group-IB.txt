# Group-IB



**Group-IB** is a cybersecurity company founded in 2003 in Moscow. In 2023, it split into two companies with a branch remaining in Moscow branded F.A.C.C.T. Group-IB and a branch in Singapore.


## History

Group-IB was founded in 2003 by Ilya Sachkov and Dmitry Volkov in Russia. The company moved to Singapore in 2019. In July 2020, it received funding from the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore through venture capital firm TNB Ventures.

In September 2021, Ilya Sachkov, its co-founder and CEO, was detained by Russian authorities for treason. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. The Russian and international business were later split with the business sold in April 2023 to Russian management to be branded FACCT. FACCT would market Group-IB products and services while being a separate entity allowing Group-IB to not directly have a presence. Ilya Sachkov maintains his involvement in the Russian business.

In 2023, the company split with a headquarters in Singapore and in Moscow. In December 2023, the Moscow office discovered that a hacking group was targeting Russian companies with a war-related phishing attack.
