## Corporate affairs


### Structure and operations

Avanade operates its business in more than 80 locations across more than 26 countries North America, Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and the Pacific.

In September 2021, Avanade entered the UAE market with the opening of offices in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Adriano Neves, Avanade's Sales, Industry and Client Relationships Lead in Brazil, has been appointed to lead the company's newest entity and will relocate from São Paulo to Dubai.

India (IDC), China (CDC) and the Philippines (PDC) supply Avanade with offshore consultants housed in parent company Accenture's delivery centers. Overall, these offshore workers constitute over 40% of Avanade's total workforce. Avanade relies heavily on offshore workers in India, China and other developing countries to help their customers reduce costs.


### Leadership

Avanade is managed by a leadership team of 17 members (2022). Pamela Maynard served as CEO from September 2019 to October 2024. Mitch Hill, a former senior partner at Andersen Consulting, was the founding CEO until August 31, 2008. Adam Warby held the position from September 1, 2008, to August 31, 2019.

Avanade's board of directors has five members (2022). The chairman of the board is Emma McGuigan.


### Finances

Avanade began filing financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006, a requirement for publicly traded companies. Alternatively, filings must be made when the number of security holders exceeded 500, which at the time, Avanade had over 1,100. As of July 1, 2008, Avanade is no longer required to file financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission as it has unregistered all securities.


## Products and services

Avanade's business model combines leading and delivering Microsoft-based projects contracted by Accenture, and its own direct business where Avanade is the contracting partner. The latter direct business has grown substantially over the past 10+ years in part due to a series of acquisitions, each of which has brought a book of direct business with it. Avanade is also the largest global partner of Microsoft and has grown its direct business continually through this channel.


## Accolades

Avanade and Accenture have been recognized as the Microsoft Alliance Partner of the Year 18 times, most recently in 2023.
