Construction of the Jinfeng Gold Mine started in 2005, and gold production began in 2007. Eldorado Gold acquired the property when they purchased Sino Gold in 2009.

## Geology

The deposit at the Jinfeng Gold Mine is a Carlin-type gold deposit (similar to those found in Nevada) in the "Laizhishan Dome" located in a region known as the "Golden Triangle". The Laizhishan Dome is made up of sedimentary rocks from the Silurian through the Late Triassic periods. The deposit itself is located between five faults, with gold being associated with pyrite and arsenopyrite.
