Finance Corps


# Finance Corps



The **United States Army Finance Corps** is a combat service support (CSS) branch of the United States Army. The Finance Corps traces its foundation to 16 June 1775, when the Second Continental Congress established the office of Paymaster General of the Army. The **Pay Department** became a separate department in 1816, and the **Finance Department** was created by law on 1 July 1920. It became the **Finance Corps** in 1950. It is responsible for financial operations, most notably payroll and resource management.


## Finance Corps units

Corps-level financial management formations exist in Europe, South Korea, as well as at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and at Fort Cavazos, Texas.

The 18th Financial Management Support Center (18 FMSC) provides financial management services to the units of the XVIII Airborne Corps. It is based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and its higher headquarters (HQ) is the 1st Theater Sustainment Command (1st TSC) Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The 18th FMSC is responsible for the 24th Financial Management Company (FMCO), the 33rd FMCO, the 82nd FMCO, the 101st FMCO, and the 126th FMCO.
The mission of the 18th Financial Management Center is:

* Rapidly deploy as part of the crisis response force by air, sea and land anywhere in the world.
* Provide financial management support for joint and combined operations (Central Funding, Disbursing, Accounting, Vendor Services, Policy and Internal Controls).
* Provide technical oversight and coordination to designated CONUS-based Financial Management Companies preparing to deploy in concert with the Army Force Generation Cycle.
* Direct employment of non-deployed FM Companies in support of the Installation finance mission in accordance with Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) (ASA FM&C) guidance

In early 1998 the Commanding General of United States Army Forces Command approved a request from the CG, XVIII Airborne Corps to combine the 18th Finance Group and the 18th Personnel Group (Airborne); to establish a provisional 18th Soldier Support Group (18th SSG) at Ft. Hood; to form SSBs at Forts Stewart, Drum and Campbell; and, to combine the two remaining Finance Battalions at Ft. Bragg. The General Officer Steering Committee (GOSC) did not support the XVIII consolidations as proposed. This decision was made without the benefit of the TRADOC force development process which was Phase 2 of the Service to the Soldier Study. It was not a foregone conclusion that SSBs and SSGs would be implemented Army-Wide. FORSCOM and XVIII Airborne Corps were forging ahead of the Soldier Support Institute study as it was expedient to do so due to the impending force reductions.
