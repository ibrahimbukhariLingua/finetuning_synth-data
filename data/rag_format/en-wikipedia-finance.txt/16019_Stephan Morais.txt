He later moved permanently to London, joining Arthur Andersen Business Consulting, to integrate the Energy and Utilities team as a Senior Consultant. He co-founded a London-based startup during the dotcom boom focusing on water trading, the Waterexchange.

Upon completing his MBA, Morais was appointed as consultant to the Portuguese Government for the privatization of a main State investing conglomerate, IPE, and for the draft of the country's National Energy policy. Morais joined Energias de Portugal in 2003 as chief of staff of the CEO and was subsequently appointed managing director of the Bilbao-based Naturgas Energia Servicios.

Having specialized in private equity investments while attending Harvard, Morais was invited to invest in, and lead as CEO, Temahome, a major Portuguese furniture design and manufacturing company, with a group of other Portuguese investors and the company's management team, in 2006. He left the company at the end of 2009. A year later, Morais was the first Portuguese person to be named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.

While at Caixa, Morais led investments in most major Portuguese and global startups, such as Farfetch, Unbabel, Uniplaces, D-Orbit, amongst others, that raised significant capital in Silicon Valley and London.
