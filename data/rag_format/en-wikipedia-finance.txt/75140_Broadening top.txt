**Broadening top** (a.k.a. a megaphone pattern) is technical analysis chart pattern describing trends of stocks, commodities, currencies, and other assets. Broadening Top formation appears much more frequently at tops than at bottoms. Its formation usually has *bearish* implications.

Regarding the *shares volume*, it is very irregular and leaves no clue to the direction of the next move.


## How broadening top is formed

In the figure above, price of the share reverses five times, reversal point *d* is made at a lower point than reversal point *b* and reversal point *c* and *e* occur successively higher than reversal point *a*.
