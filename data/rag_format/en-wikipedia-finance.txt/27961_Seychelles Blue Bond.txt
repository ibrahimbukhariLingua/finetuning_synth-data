Seychelles Blue Bond


# Seychelles Blue Bond



The **Seychelles blue bond** was the first sovereign bond issued specifically to finance ocean conservation and sustainable development. It was issued by the government of Seychelles on October 29, 2018, and raised US$15 million. The proceeds from the bond were used to support the expansion of marine protected areas, the improving fisheries management, promotion of sustainable tourism and the development of climate-resilient coastal communities


## Background

The Seychelles is a small island country in the Indian Ocean. It is a popular tourist destination with an economy that is heavily dependent on the ocean. In Seychelles, the fisheries sector employs 17% of the population and contributes 20% to GDP

The Seychelles is also vulnerable to climate change as rising sea levels and ocean acidification continues to threaten costal communities and marine ecosystems.


## Bond

The Seychelles blue bond is a 10-year bond with a coupon of 6.5%. It was issued through a private placement to three impact investors: Calvert Impact Capital, Nuveen and Prudential.

The bond was initiated with a US$5million guarantee from the World Bank. In addition, the World Bank provided a US$5million concessional loan to help cover the interest payments on the bond


## Proceeds

The proceeds from the bond were used to support a number of projects including

1. The expansion of marine protected areas through a committed effort by the government of Seychelles to increase the protected Exclusive Economic Zone to 30% by 2020.
2. The improvement of fisheries management by funding the development of new fisheries management tools
3. The development of new infrastructure to improve climate-resilience and the implementation of climate adaptation measures.

## Impact

The Seychelles Blue Bond was a success and has inspired the issuance of other blue bonds by countries such as Belize, Palau and Tonga.
