In 2000, Melsheimer represented prominent Dallas civil rights leader and longtime City Council member Al Lipscomb, once called the “Jackie Robinson of Dallas city government,” in a bribery case. The district court moved the case from Dallas to Amarillo, a move Melsheimer argued was improper and unfair. After conviction, Melsheimer successfully argued for a sentence of home confinement. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded the district court had erred in moving the trial to Amarillo and reversed the conviction.
