Valuation (measure theory)


# Valuation (measure theory)



In measure theory, or at least in the approach to it via the domain theory, a **valuation** is a map from the class of open sets of a topological space to the set of positive real numbers including infinity, with certain properties. It is a concept closely related to that of a measure, and as such, it finds applications in measure theory, probability theory, and theoretical computer science.


## Domain/Measure theory definition

Let {\displaystyle \scriptstyle (X,{\mathcal {T}})} be a topological space: a **valuation** is any set function
{\displaystyle v:{\mathcal {T}}\to \mathbb {R} ^{+}\cup \{+\infty \}}
satisfying the following three properties
{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lll}v(\varnothing )=0&&\scriptstyle {\text{Strictness property}}\\v(U)\leq v(V)&{\mbox{if}}~U\subseteq V\quad U,V\in {\mathcal {T}}&\scriptstyle {\text{Monotonicity property}}\\v(U\cup V)+v(U\cap V)=v(U)+v(V)&\forall U,V\in {\mathcal {T}}&\scriptstyle {\text{Modularity property}}\,\end{array}}}

The definition immediately shows the relationship between a valuation and a measure: the properties of the two mathematical object are often very similar if not identical, the only difference being that the domain of a measure is the Borel algebra of the given topological space, while the domain of a valuation is the class of open sets. Further details and references can be found in Alvarez-Manilla, Edalat & Saheb-Djahromi 2000 and Goubault-Larrecq 2005.


### Continuous valuation

A valuation (as defined in domain theory/measure theory) is said to be **continuous** if for *every directed family* {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \{U\_{i}\}\_{i\in I}} *of open sets* (i.e. an indexed family of open sets which is also directed in the sense that for each pair of indexes {\displaystyle i} and {\displaystyle j} belonging to the index set {\displaystyle I}, there exists an index {\displaystyle k} such that {\displaystyle \scriptstyle U\_{i}\subseteq U\_{k}} and {\displaystyle \scriptstyle U\_{j}\subseteq U\_{k}}) the following equality holds:
{\displaystyle v\left(\bigcup \_{i\in I}U\_{i}\right)=\sup \_{i\in I}v(U\_{i}).}

This property is analogous to the Ï„-additivity of measures.


### Simple valuation

A valuation (as defined in domain theory/measure theory) is said to be **simple** if it is a finite linear combination with non-negative coefficients of Dirac valuations, that is,
{\displaystyle v(U)=\sum \_{i=1}^{n}a\_{i}\delta \_{x\_{i}}(U)\quad \forall U\in {\mathcal {T}}}
where {\displaystyle a\_{i}} is always greater than or at least equal to zero for all index {\displaystyle i}. Simple valuations are obviously continuous in the above sense. The supremum of a *directed family of simple valuations* (i.e. an indexed family of simple valuations which is also directed in the sense that for each pair of indexes {\displaystyle i} and {\displaystyle j} belonging to the index set {\displaystyle I}, there exists an index {\displaystyle k} such that {\displaystyle \scriptstyle v\_{i}(U)\leq v\_{k}(U)\!} and {\displaystyle \scriptstyle v\_{j}(U)\leq v\_{k}(U)\!}) is called **quasi-simple valuation**
{\displaystyle {\bar {v}}(U)=\sup \_{i\in I}v\_{i}(U)\quad \forall U\in {\mathcal {T}}.\,}

* The **extension problem** for a given valuation (in the sense of domain theory/measure theory) consists in finding under what type of conditions it can be extended to a measure on a proper topological space, which may or may not be the same space where it is defined: the papers Alvarez-Manilla, Edalat & Saheb-Djahromi 2000 and Goubault-Larrecq 2005 in the reference section are devoted to this aim and give also several historical details.
* The concepts of **valuation on convex sets** and **valuation on manifolds** are a generalization of valuation in the sense of domain/measure theory. A valuation on convex sets is allowed to assume complex values, and the underlying topological space is the set of non-empty convex compact subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space: a valuation on manifolds is a complex valued finitely additive measure defined on a proper subset of the class of all compact submanifolds of the given manifolds.

## Examples


### Dirac valuation

Let {\displaystyle \scriptstyle (X,{\mathcal {T}})} be a topological space, and let *{\displaystyle x}* be a point of *{\displaystyle X}*: the map
{\displaystyle \delta \_{x}(U)={\begin{cases}0&{\mbox{if}}~x\notin U\\1&{\mbox{if}}~x\in U\end{cases}}\quad {\text{ for all }}U\in {\mathcal {T}}}
is a valuation in the domain theory/measure theory, sense called **Dirac valuation**. This concept bears its origin from distribution theory as it is an obvious transposition to valuation theory of Dirac distribution: as seen above, Dirac valuations are the "bricks" simple valuations are made of.
