***Virtonomics*** is a massively multiplayer business simulation video game developed by Cyprus indie developer Gamerflot. It allows the players to be in charge of fictional start-ups in several industries. There are three different versions available: Entrepreneur, Business War and Tycoon.


## Gameplay

*Virtonomics* resembles Trevor Chan's business simulation game *Capitalism 2*. It simulates the basic principles and processes of businesses in a competitive environment.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ There are no predefined victory or failure conditions, and the game does not end. Players define their own end goals for the game, and try achieve them using strategy and tactics. Typically, the main goal is to build a successful business amidst competition.

*Virtonomics* is a multiplayer game, and players mainly interact with other players as well as with a computer-controlled opponent. It is turn-based game, and each turn lasts a fixed length of time. Generally, turns are a day long, and for a regular player, the game required 15 to 60 minutes a day. In 2014, the developers released a "fast realm", a game server where turns were an hour long; this was designed for players in short-term business training.

Currently Virtonomics has six realms: Vera, Olga, Mary, Lien, Fast and Anna.

In the game, players may engage in agriculture, exploitation of natural resources, manufacturing, retail, foreign exchange market trade, finance, personnel management, marketing, logistics, scientific research and other business processes.
