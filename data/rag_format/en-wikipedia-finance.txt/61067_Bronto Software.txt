## History

In 2002, Joe Colopy and Chaz Felix founded Bronto Software in Durham, North Carolina. Bronto Software is currently based in the American Tobacco District of Durham, North Carolina. The company was named after Joe Colopy's childhood interest in dinosaurs.

In 2011, Bronto Software expanded its office space to accommodate business growth. In March 2012, Bronto opened an office in London to develop business growth in Europe.

In 2011, Bronto grew with a 54% increase in revenue and team growth of 40%, finishing the year with 118 employees. In September 2012, Bronto was named the leading self-service email provider and the second overall leading email service provider according to the Internet Retailer Top 1000. After 2012, Bronto had 152 employees and offices in Durham, NC, and London, UK. Bronto Software expanded operations in February 2014 by opening an office in Sydney, Australia.

On August 13, 2014, Bronto announced that they had doubled their world headquarters at the American Tobacco Campus in Durham, NC, adding 47,000 square feet for a total of 80,000 square feet. According to Bronto CEO Joe Colopy, "The move reflects our focus on high growth and further supports our goal of remaining one of the preeminent places to work in the Triangle and being a center for software innovation."

In April 2015, NetSuite (now Oracle NetSuite, after Oracle acquired Netsuite in 2016) signed an agreement to acquire Bronto Software for $200 million.

On March 2, 2021, Oracle NetSuite sent an email to some customers with the news that the company had assigned the core product suite, Bronto Email Marketing Platform, to “end of life” status and shut down all services on May 31, 2022.
