## Career


### Early career

Messer began his career as the assistant director of the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information (CITI) from 1995 to 1996 working with Columbia Business School professor Eli Noam. While at CITI, Messer covered Cybercommunications (the Internet), the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other key mass media issues of the time. Messer has remained an affiliated research fellow at CITI and is a regular speaker at Columbia Business School on topics ranging from electronic commerce to emerging technologies.


### LinkShare Corporation

In 1996, Messer recognized the Internet's enormous potential, and with his sister, Heidi Messer, set out to create an online distribution network that would allow websites to monetize their traffic through performance based links. Messer recruited Cheryl Ho and Horace Meng to help he and his sister create LinkShare Corporation.

The company initially faltered, landing only 15 clients in its first year despite the Messers' extensive efforts. By year three, though, it regained its footing and took off, with 150 businesses signing up to take advantage of this new revenue concept. Messer served as chairman and CEO of LinkShare until its sale in 2005 to Rakuten Inc. for $425 million. In 2006, Messer exited the company, which was later renamed Rakuten LinkShare.

Messer was awarded patents around the concept of affiliate marketing. The first of these patents, which covered a cookie-less way of tracking commission information, was covered in the NY Times.
