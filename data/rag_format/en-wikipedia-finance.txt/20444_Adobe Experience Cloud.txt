Adobe Experience Cloud


# Adobe Experience Cloud



**Adobe Experience Cloud** (**AEC**), formerly **Adobe Marketing Cloud** (**AMC**), is a collection of integrated online marketing and web analytics products by Adobe.


## History

Adobe Experience Cloud is a comprehensive suite that encompasses analytics, social, advertising, media optimization, targeting, web experience management, journey orchestration, and content management services, hosted on Microsoft Azure.

The suite, initially known as Adobe Marketing Cloud, was unveiled in October 2012 as part of Adobe's strategy to phase out the Omniture brand, which it had acquired in October 2009. The suite integrates products from the acquired company, Omniture, along with other services into a unified cloud service.

This integration includes eight main applications: Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Campaign (both Classic and Standard versions), Audience Manager, and Primetime.

On September 15, 2009, Adobe Systems announced its intention to purchase Omniture, Inc., a company specializing in online marketing and web analytics based in Orem, Utah. The acquisition, valued at $1.8 billion, was finalized on October 23, 2009. Post-acquisition, Omniture's offerings were progressively integrated into what is now known as Adobe's Digital Marketing Business Unit, alongside other acquisitions such as Day Software and Efficient Frontier.

In an effort to enhance its marketing cloud's capabilities, Adobe acquired Satellite TMS from Search Discovery in 2013 and rebranded it as Adobe Dynamic Tag Management (Adobe DTM), laying the groundwork for Adobe Launch. Introduced in 2018, Adobe Launch represents the next evolution in tag management systems developed by the company.

Adobe announced the acquisition of Magento for $1.68 billion on May 21, 2018. This acquisition aimed to incorporate commerce features into the Adobe Experience Cloud. Later that same year, on September 20, Adobe proceeded to acquire Marketo, a marketing automation company.

By 2021, Adobe Experience Platform Launch was slated to be integrated into the Adobe Experience Platform as part of a broader suite of data collection technologies.
