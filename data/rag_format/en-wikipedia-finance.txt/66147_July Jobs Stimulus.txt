July Jobs Stimulus


# July Jobs Stimulus



The **July Jobs Stimulus** is a €7.4 billion stimulus package announced by the Government of Ireland on 23 July 2020 in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland. The package includes 50 measures to boost economic recovery and get people back to work. The spending primarily includes €115 million for active travel, public transport and renewal of transport infrastructure, €75 million for primary and secondary schools to carry out reconfiguration works necessary to support schools' reopening in late August and September 2020 and €112 million in employment services and supports to deliver 47,500 training and apprenticeship places and a €450 million package of business supports including a €250 million Restart Grant to provide direct grant aid to businesses with up to 250 employees to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers.

The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, due to close on 10 August, would be extended until April 2021 and will be gradually reduced to €203 per week over that period based on the pre-pandemic earnings of the claimant as part of the package. From 17 September 2020, the scheme would close to new applications and the headline rate of payment would reduce from €350 to €300. The Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme would be replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme in September 2020, which would run until April 2021.
