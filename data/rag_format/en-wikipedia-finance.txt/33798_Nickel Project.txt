Nickel Project


# Nickel Project



The **Nickel Project** refers to a transportation funding initiative enacted by the Washington State Legislature in 2003. The program's slogan, “It's your Nickel, Watch it Work,” reflects its funding mechanism and commitment to infrastructure improvement.


## Funding

The Nickel Project was designed to generate $3.9 billion over a ten-year period to finance 158 transportation projects across Washington. The funding was sourced through:

* **Gas Tax Increase** — A 5-cent per gallon increase in the state gasoline tax.
* **Heavy Truck Fees** — A 15% increase in gross weight fees for heavy trucks.
* **Vehicle Sales Tax** — A 0.3% increase in the sales tax on motor vehicles.

These revenue streams were allocated to the Nickel Account, dedicated exclusively to the specified transportation projects.


## Project scope

The 158 projects funded under the Nickel Project aimed to address various transportation needs, including:

* **Congestion relief** — Allocating $2.6 billion to alleviate traffic congestion in critical areas.
* **Safety enhancements** — Implementing measures to improve road safety.
* **Infrastructure preservation** — Maintaining and upgrading existing transportation infrastructure.
