The enactment of the Bank and Financial Institution Act (BAFIA) in February 2004 abolished all Acts related to financial institutions including the ADBN Act, 1967. In line with the BAFIA, ADBL has been incorporated as a public limited company on July 14, 2005. Thus, ADBL operates as an "A" category financial Institution under the legal framework of BAFIA and the Company Act. The bank has a 51% share of the Government of Nepal and 49% of the general public. Most of its shareholders are customers and employees.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
