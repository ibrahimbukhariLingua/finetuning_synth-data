Responsible Research


# Responsible Research



**Responsible Research Pte Ltd** is an independent Environmental Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) research firm for global institutional asset owners and asset managers. Based in Singapore, Responsible Research analyses the ESG factors and regulatory landscapes that increasingly threaten portfolio returns in Asian markets.

Many signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) believe that ESG risks and opportunities are not adequately covered by traditional investment research. Responsible Research partners with PRI signatories and asset managers to analyse the trends of ESG practices, and the impact of disclosure on Socially Responsible Investment portfolios in Asia.


## Operations
