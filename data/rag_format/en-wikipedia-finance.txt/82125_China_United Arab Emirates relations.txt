China–United Arab Emirates relations


# China–United Arab Emirates relations



**China – United Arab Emirates relations** refer to the diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the United Arab Emirates. Diplomatic ties were first established in 1984. The UAE maintains an embassy in Beijing and a consulate-general in Hong Kong while China has an embassy in Abu Dhabi and consulate-general in Dubai. The UAE and China have been strong international allies, with significant cooperation across economic, political and cultural aspects.


## Background

The relations between the two have historically been mounted on high-level trade. In 2007, China-UAE bilateral trade scaled new highs, exceeding $19.4 billion and indicating a growth rate of 41 percent. There are also some 2,000 Chinese firms operating in the UAE and a large community of Chinese in the United Arab Emirates who are involved primarily in the construction sector. Additionally, the UAE is China's second largest trading partner in the Persian Gulf region and the largest in terms of buying Chinese products.

According to Wen Jiabao, "the UAE is one of China's most important economic partners in the Persian Gulf region, serving as a transfer center for Chinese products to the Middle East and African markets." He also encouraged Emirati businesses to invest in China and Chinese companies to invest in the UAE, noting that the expansion of bilateral cooperation facilitates the fundamental interests of both nations.

During a visit to China in 2010, UAE Minister of Foreign Trade Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi expressed that the UAE was keen on strengthening its strategic partnership with China and developing commercial and investment cooperation.

Despite pressure from the US, Abu Dhabi's cooperation with China over artificial intelligence and upgradation of hi-tech industries continued. Analysts were warning that strengthening relations between the UAE and Beijing, citing the May 2024 visit of Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to China, were “not irreversible” and may cause issues with the US. In the meeting, UAE-China vowed on closer cooperation in areas including artificial intelligence. The US and China have most intensive competition in the areas on which Abu Dhabi and Beijing were vowing cooperation, including trade and investment, science and technology, and others. That was becoming an increasing concern for Washington. In May 2024, US restricted the UAE's G42 to reduce its association with China. In 2023, the US also stopped the Emirati plans to participate in China's 2026 Chang’e-7 moon mission, considering the US technology transfer restrictions.


## Ventures

In May 2010, both sides inked a memorandum of understanding with the aim of pushing forward cooperation in railway construction. Under the document, signed by Liu Zhijun and Sheikh Hamdan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, the two sides will launch extensive cooperation in such areas as railway development, engineering construction, technical exchanges and personnel training.


## Diplomatic visits

In July 2018, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping visited UAE. Xi meets Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum & Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi. Xi was awarded Order of Zayed by President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.


## Belt and Road initiative

China and the UAE signed $3.4 billion worth of deals as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative aims to use the Port of Jebel Ali to ship Chinese products to the world using the UAE's position as both sea and land trading hub.


## Immigration

There are over 180,000 people of Chinese origin living in the UAE.


## Human rights

In July 2019, UN ambassadors of 37 countries, including UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China's treatment of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region.

In June 2020, UAE was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations.
