# UniSuper



**UniSuper** is an Australian superannuation fund that provides superannuation services to employees of Australia's higher education and research sector. The fund has over 615,000 members and A$124 billion in funds under management, as of 30 June 2023.

UniSuper is a not-for-profit company whose shareholders are 37 Australian universities and is governed by a corporate Trustee, UniSuper Limited. All the universities have representation on the Consultative Committee.

UniSuper has been granted a MySuper authority, enabling it to continue to receive default superannuation contributions from 1 January 2014.


## Fund history

UniSuper was founded in 1 October 2000, as a result of a merger between the Superannuation Scheme for Australian Universities (SSAU) and the Tertiary Education Superannuation Scheme (TESS). Prior to the merger, UniSuper had been the trustee for the SSAU.

UniSuper has pursued a strategy of buying 'fortress' stocks (defensible against disruption), as well as bringing investment functions in-house, in order to achieve significant returns over time.

In May 2024, due to a misconfiguration of a Google Cloud VMware Engine Private Cloud by Google operators as a result of leaving a parameter blank, a previously unknown bug was triggered, resulting in all of UniSuper's data on the platform being deleted. The vast majority of data was later recovered from backup sources, and Google put in place safeguards to ensure a similar incident would not happen again. Google described it as a "one-of-a-kind" event which had never previously occurred within Google Cloud.


## Fund governance

UniSuper's day-to-day administration is managed by a wholly owned company, UniSuper Management Pty Ltd (UniSuper Management).

UniSuper's Chief Executive Officer is Peter Chun.
