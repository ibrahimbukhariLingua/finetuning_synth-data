# Libro.fm



**Libro.fm** is an audiobook app that splits its profits with an independent bookstore of the customer's choosing. In 2022, the company's publicity director Albee Romero told The Orange County Register that half of all profits go to the selected independent bookshop. It has created apps for Android, iPhone, and Apple Watch and is free of digital rights management, meaning all books can be downloaded on other devices without restrictions.

The Seattle-based company is employee-owned and a social purpose corporation.
