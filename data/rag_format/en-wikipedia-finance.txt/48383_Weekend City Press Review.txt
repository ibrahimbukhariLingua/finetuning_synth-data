# Weekend City Press Review



**Weekend City Press Review** is a UK publishing company which provides a summary of all the weekend's financial and business news by using 13 UK newspapers as well as summarising every company tipped in both the newspapers and the Investors Chronicle. It was created in 1991 and has attracted a range of subscribers, from city institutions and FTSE listed companies, to educational establishments and private investors.

Subscribers benefit from comprehensive coverage of major company and business stories without having to read the entire story. Weekend City Press Review is noted as "an excellent comprehensive roundup of the weekend's press" in Dominic Connolly's book *The UK Trader's Bible*.

It is believed that Weekend City Press Review was the first UK publisher of business news online—its first article appearing in 1995.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
