# Enterprise Records



**Enterprise Records** was started in 1967 as a sub-label of Stax Records. It's best-known recording artist during its existence was Isaac Hayes, who secured a #1 R&B and pop crossover smash in 1971 with the soundtrack hit "Theme from Shaft". In addition to Isaac Hayes, Big Ben Atkins, Cliff Cochran, Connie Eaton, Maynard Ferguson , Little Sonny, O.B. McClinton, Eric Mercury and David Porter also recorded for the label.


## Background

Enterprise was a subsidiary of the Stax label. It was founded in 1967.

In May 1968, parent company Stax ended its relationship with the Atlantic label as they had merged with Gulf- Western Industries, Inc. which was the umbrella org. of Paramount Pictures. The upper management of Stax remained the same with Jim Stewart staying on as president and Al Bell staying on as vice-president. They were to work directly with Arnold D. Burk, who was the vice -president in charge of music operations for Paramount Pictures . In addition to their desire to expand the Enterprise label, they were looking to do the same with their pop -rock label, Hip Records. It appears at the time, Enterprise was regarded as a jazz-folk label.

An example of some of the success Enterprise was having can be seen in the May 16, 1970 issue of *Billboard* where the label had three albums in the *Billboard* Best Selling Soul albums chart. *The Isaac Hayes Movement* album by Isaac Hayes was at no. 1, the *Gritty, Groovy, & Gettin' It* album by David Porter was at no. 4, and the *Hot Buttered Soul* album by Isaac Hayes was at no. 10. The two Isaac Hayes LPs were also at no. 1 and no. 6 respectively in the Best Selling Jazz LP's chart that week.
