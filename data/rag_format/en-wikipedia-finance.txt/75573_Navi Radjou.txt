## Criticism

Radjou and his co-authors’ work on jugaad (innovation) has been criticized by Indian academics and scientists such as Rishikesha Krishnan, Vijay Govindarajan, Anil Gupta, and RA Mashelkar who believe the practice of jugaad can lead only to makeshift solutions that are unsafe, unscalable, and unsustainable.

Radjou addressed this criticism in an article in *Thinkers* magazine arguing that jugaad isn’t intrinsically good or bad. Jugaad is a creative mindset: it is the *intention* (good or bad) of the person using this ingenious mindset that determines the quality of the outcome (positive or negative).
