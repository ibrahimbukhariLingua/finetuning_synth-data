## History

Founded in 1882, the Bell Telephone Company built a manually operated exchange with a capacity of 800 numbers and 26 households signed up. In two years the roll had increased to 3,000. In 1891 the Swedish-Danish-Russian Joint Stock Company signed a contract to provide service to Moscow for 18 years. In 1994 the Moscow City Telephone Network was structured into a joint stock company. A majority stake is held by Mobile TeleSystems.

In November 2013 it was reported that the company chose four suppliers of main and distribution of fiber optic cables for the development of optical fiber cables network until 2016 volume of purchases made more than 1 billion rubles. Earlier that month the company announced rebranding and new positioning of the company as a multi-service operator, to create a single digital platform of Moscow. In 2014 the operator will complete the construction of a dagital technology platform based on fiber networks to buildings (FTTx) and will provide all users access to a package of services, including broadband Internet access (broadband), digital TV, and telephony.
