Pinsent Masons has roots dating back to 1769. The modern day firm is the product of a series of mergers between firms including Pinsent & Co, Masons, Simpson Curtis, Biddle & Co, L'Estrange & Brett and McGrigors. Alumni of the legacy firms include former British Chancellor Alistair Darling.

The firm's recent history has been dominated by a process of internationalisation.

The firm's board is led by Senior Partner Andrew Masraf and Managing Partner Laura Cameron. In 2016 the firm announced the appointment of former Secretary of State for International Development Douglas Alexander as a strategic adviser, and appointed its first external board member in the form of former banker Pauline Egan.
