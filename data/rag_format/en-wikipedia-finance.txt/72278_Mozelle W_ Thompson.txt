### Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

In 1997, Thompson was one of three candidates under consideration to replace Steven Wallman on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Instead, Thompson was appointed that year President Bill Clinton to serve on the Federal Trade Commission for a term that expired on September 25, 2003. He replaced the vacant seat held by Christine A. Varney and was in office until August 2004, until he was succeeded by Jon Leibowitz.

During his tenure at the Federal Trade Commission, he also served as a delegate to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development and chaired its Committee on Consumer Policy. In 2004, Thompson ultimately agreed to support the then-proposed Sony-BMG merger deal, though he stated he had reservations about the potential impact of the deal on the music industry.

As of 2021, Thompson is one of just three African-Americans to have served on the FTC: The other two were A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. (served from 1962-1964) and Pamela Jones Harbour (served from 2003-2009).
