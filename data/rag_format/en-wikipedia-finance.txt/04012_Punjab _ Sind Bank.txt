## History

The first branch of the bank in Amritsar was established on 24 June 1908 by Bhai Vir Singh, Sir Sunder Singh Majitha, and Sardar Tarlochan Singh to serve the then Sind and Punjab areas of colonial India.

On 15 April 1980, Punjab & Sind Bank was among six banks that the Government of India nationalised in the second wave of nationalisation (the first wave had been in 1969 when the government nationalised the top 14 banks).

In the 1960s, Punjab & Sind Bank established a branch in London. In 1991 Bank of Baroda acquired Punjab & Sind Bank's London branch at the behest of the Reserve Bank of India following Punjab & Sind's involvement in the Sethia fraud in 1987.

Since 2004, the bank has shown growth of over 40% year on year, and its IPO was oversubscribed by more than 50 times.

On 16 July 2019, Punjab & Sind Bank disclosed that it detected a fraud, worth ₹238 crore (US$27 million) by the Bhushan Power & Steel Limited.
