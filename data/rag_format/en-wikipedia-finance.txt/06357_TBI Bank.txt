## History

In 2002, TBIF Financial Services (TBIF), a former Kardan Group Dutch subsidiary, established TBI Credit in Bulgaria. It also set up additional companies, such as TBI Invest, TBI Leasing, TBI Rent and TBI Asset Management, creating one of the largest nonbanking networks in the country.

In 2011, TBIF acquired the Bulgarian branch of Nova Ljubljanska Banka (Slovenia) and entered the banking sector. This led to the consolidation of the businesses and the birth of tbi bank.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
