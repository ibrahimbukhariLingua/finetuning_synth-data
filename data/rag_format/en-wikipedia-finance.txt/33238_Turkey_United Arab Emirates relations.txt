Turkey–United Arab Emirates relations


# Turkey–United Arab Emirates relations



Turkey and the United Arab Emirates share extensive cultural, military and economic ties, but relations have substantially deteriorated since Arab Spring, and later started to recover in the recent years.


## Economic relations

Turkey is one of the UAE's largest trading partners, with US$9 billion in annual bilateral trade volume - triggering a rise of 800 percent in the last seven years; the year of 2008 saw foreign trade figures reveal Turkey as one of the UAE's top 10 biggest suppliers while over the past five years (2004-2008), UAE's exports to Turkey have increased six-fold. In an attempt to enhance tourism bonds, the UAE launched new Etihad Airways flights to Istanbul in 2009, serving the city four times a week.

Emirati businessmen have been encouraged by multiple real estate agencies to invest in Turkey, as part of Turkey's ongoing privatization efforts. In 2010, both sides pledged on improving commercial relations through common projects and convene officials in the future to determine possible areas of cooperation.

There is considerable Turkish presence in the UAE including Turkish construction companies which have put their signature on many developments in the region. In addition, there is a small community of Turks in the United Arab Emirates. According to the Turkish embassy, the number of Turkish companies established in the UAE is over 400, with 75 of those operating in and around Abu Dhabi.

On 24 November 2021, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates signed accords on energy and technology investments after talks between President Tayyip Erdogan and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan in Ankara.


## Diplomatic relations


### Egyptian Crisis (2011–14)

The diplomatic relations between the two countries have soured over differing attitudes to the Egyptian crisis and its aftermath, with Turkey backing the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt and the UAE supporting military rule under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.


### 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt

Turkish media in 2017 accused UAE of supporting the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, with a Turkish columnist claiming that UAE financially supported the coup plotters. Turkish media also alleged that a series of leaked emails in June 2017 by Emirati ambassador to United States Yousef Al Otaiba correspondence with Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C. based think tank, led credence to the alleged support.


### Qatar diplomatic crisis and detoriation of ties (2017-2021)

The UAE has been critical of Turkey's backing of Qatar during the 2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis.

In May 2017, the UAE's Ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba described Turkey under Erdoğan as a "long-term threat" to both the UAE and the United States.

In December 2017, the UAE's foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, shared a tweet that claimed an Ottoman general had robbed Medina during Ottoman rule. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded by describing him as an "impertinent man" who was "spoiled by oil". Emirati diplomat Anwar Gargash responded, "The sectarian and partisan view is not an acceptable alternative, and the Arab world will not be led by Tehran or Ankara."


### Syrian Civil War

In August 2017, the UAE accused Turkey of "colonial and competitive behavior" by "trying to reduce the sovereignty of the Syrian state" through its military presence in Syria.

The UAE has provided support for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, which fought against Turkish troops in northern Syria. Turkey has accused the UAE of also supporting the Kurdistan Workers' Party in its conflict with the Turkish government.

In March 2018, Gargash stated that relations between the countries "aren’t in their best state" and called on Turkey to "respect Arab sovereignty and deal with its neighbors with wisdom and rationality".

In May 2018, Gargash called for Arab countries to unite against rising Turkish and Iranian influence in the Middle East.


### Yemeni Civil War

In May 2018, Turkey expressed concern towards the deployment of Emirati troops in Socotra without the Yemeni government being informed beforehand, claiming it presents "a new threat to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Yemen".


### Armenian genocide recognition

In 2019, the United Arab Emirates' leadership announced it would begin the formal process to recognize the Armenian genocide. Emirate of Abu Dhabi had become the first emirate to recognize the genocide in April 2019.


### 2020 Abraham Accords

Turkey condemned the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and UAE in 2020. The Turkish government threatened to suspend diplomatic relations and recall its ambassador from Abu Dhabi over the establishment of Israel-UAE diplomatic relations.


### Reconciliation and cooperation since 2021

Turkey and the UAE reconciliation efforts started to make progress in 2021 with the visit of UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed to Turkey. Erdogan visited Abu Dhabi in 2022 to meet UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and signing currency swap and trade agreements between the two countries as well as talks of cooperation in the defense industry. Erdogan's visit was welcomed in a big ceremony to show a shift in the relations in a positive direction. Turkey agreed to sell Bayraktar drones to the UAE as part of restoring relations and increasing cooperation between the nations. Turkish drones proved to be superior in quality to their Chinese counterparts and easier to acquire than American drones. Additionally, the common mistrust of the Biden administration between both countries enabled deeper cooperation over America's decision to not deliver F-35s to Turkey and the UAE, while approving F-35s to Israel and other Western countries.

During the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes, amongst the Gulf Cooperation Council members, UAE assisted Turkey the most in earthquake relief aid efforts, allocating $114.6 million for earthquake relief efforts in Syria and Turkey. The significant role of the Emirates during the earthquakes has played a role on improvement of relations between the two nations.

Turkey and the UAE were the targets of the US sanctions due to their ties with Russia. Both Turkey and the UAE remains key destinations for many Russians since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War and both countries have good relations with Russia against American sanctions.

The UAE, Turkey, Iraq, and Qatar have agreed to invest on the Iraq Development Road project. The project is expected to significantly boost Iraq's economy while increasing cooperation between the Gulf nations and Turkey; it will also challenge the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor, highlighting the UAE's ambitions to diversify its economic and geopolitical interests.
