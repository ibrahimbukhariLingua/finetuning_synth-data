On 15 July 1998, the first white Mitsubishi L200, with the typical Brazilian morphology, left the assembly line: double cab, diesel engine and 4-wheel drive. With 14,000 m² of built area and 150 employees, five vehicles were produced per day.

In 2000, Mitsubishi launched the Anhanguera I project. In the first phase, four production processes were verticalized - welding, pre-treatment and body painting and plastic parts - and the launch of new products, the Pajero TR4 and the L200 Sport. The built area increased to 44 thousand m² and the installed capacity increased to 30 thousand units per year, in two production lines.
