## Criticism and controversy

**Diversity Equity and Inclusion Concerns**

Brian Cornell publicly stated commitment to programs at Target to support diversity, equity and inclusion following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. He stated “I recognize that it’s time to take it to another level, and that as CEOs, we have to be the company’s head of diversity and inclusion." One of the created programs intended to help Black entrepreneurs develop, test, and scale products to sell at mass retailers promised to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by 2025.

In 2025, Target announced an abrupt change to these policies following an executive order from President Trump ordering a dismantling of the federal government’s diversity and inclusion programs. Target announced a halt to many programs designed to increase diversity equity and inclusion at Target. The company also said it would no longer participate in external diversity surveys, including the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index

Following Target's statement to roll back on equitable hiring practices, Twin Cities Pride announced Target would no longer be participating in the 2025 Pride Festival.
