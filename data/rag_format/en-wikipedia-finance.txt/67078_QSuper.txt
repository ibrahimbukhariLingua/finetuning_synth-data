# QSuper



**QSuper** was an Australian superannuation fund based in Brisbane, Queensland. The fund was established in 1912 through an Act of Parliament. The State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme was also known as the QSuper Fund. The board of trustees of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (QSuper Board) was responsible for the management of the QSuper Fund. On 26 Oct 2015 Michael Pennisi, the chief strategy officer replaced Rosemary Vilgan as CEO, who had served in that position for 18 years.

QSuper was a not-for-profit fund and had a MySuper authority, with around 585,000 members and $113 billion funds under management. On 1 December 2016, the Queensland Government passed legislation lifting application restrictions from just government employees and their spouses, which took effect on 30 June 2017.

On 28 February 2022, QSuper merged with Sunsuper to become part of the Australian Retirement Trust.
