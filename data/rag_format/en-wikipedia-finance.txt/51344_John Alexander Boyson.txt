In 1906, Arbuthnot Crash caused Binny to loss a lot of money. Boyson tried to organise a local guarantee but this failed. He then negotiated with James Lyle Mackay, founder of the Inchcape group and the Inchcape group agreed to acquire and restructure Binny. His partnership stake in the old firm became worthless but he managed to make himself managers of the new firm with an annual salary of 3500 pounds plus 20% of the net profits.

In 1914, he was knighted and returned to England where he remained a Director at the London office till his death in 1926.
