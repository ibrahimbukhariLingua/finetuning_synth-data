Kinnisvara were accused.

In 2012, Harju County Court acquitted all the defendants of the land swap case and ordered the state to pay the defendants' court costs.


## Business argument with Sukles

Saarte Investeering and MaxKinnisvara started their cooperation in 2004 in order to construct the Hirvepargi housing development in Sauga parish, Pärnu County. By the year 2007, twelve houses had been erected when the project needed additional financing to proceed with the construction. The owners of MaxKinnisvara didn’t want to add any more money to the initial investment of 20,000 euros and, as a consequence, disagreements arose between the partners.

Ongoing disagreements resulted in ordering a hit in 2010.

The police managed to prevent the hit and Andrus Sukles was arrested.

Harju County Court found that Sukles wished to kill his former business partner and also made preparations to achieve that. However, Sukles was acquitted.

Tullio Liblik is the first child of her mother.
