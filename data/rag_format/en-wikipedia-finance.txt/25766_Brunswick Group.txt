Founded in 1987 by Sir Alan Parker, as of 2024, Brunswick claimed as clients roughly one-third of the companies in the FTSE 100 and a stable of international corporate groups such as AT&T, BlackRock and LVMH. As of 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the company employed 1,300 in 27 cities in the UK and abroad.


## History

Brunswick Chairman Sir Alan Parker's leadership of Save the Children faced controversy over allegations of mishandling complaints against former chief executive Justin Forsyth. In 2015, a report suggested that Parker's close relationship with Forsyth may have influenced his response to accusations of inappropriate behavior made by three female employees. Critics argued that the organization's leadership failed to address the complaints adequately, leading to scrutiny of Parker's role in the matter. Parker declined to comment on the allegations. Roughly a week after the inquiry was announced, Parker resigned.

In 2021, Brunswick Group agreed to sell a 10.7% stake to BDT Capital Partners, a U.S. investment fund led by Warren Buffett's banker Byron Trott. The deal valued the British public relations firm at £500 million ($697.85 million). As part of the transaction, the firm's founder and Chairman Sir Alan Parker received £70 million from the sale of his stake.

Brunswick reported revenues of £413mn in 2022, having diversified from public relations into areas including investor relations, regulation, environmental, social and governance; and geopolitical advice, with a significant US advisory arm.

In February 2024, Brunswick appointed Henry Timms, former CEO of New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, as its new head. Timms succeeds Neal Wolin, who previously served in senior roles under the Clinton and Obama administrations.

In June 2024, Stanford University's School of Sustainability enlisted Brunswick Group to address potential reputational challenges linked to its ties with fossil fuel companies. The decision received criticism from campus climate activists, who oppose Brunswick's work with oil and gas firms. Brunswick defended its role, saying that engaging with companies in complex industries is essential for advancing decarbonization efforts.

As of August 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Brunswick Group had advised on 155 transactions totaling $279.9 billion, including deals such as the proposed merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global, Endeavor's sale to Silver Lake, and BlackRock's acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners. The firm also provided strategic advice on Starbucks' union relations and Reddit's IPO.
