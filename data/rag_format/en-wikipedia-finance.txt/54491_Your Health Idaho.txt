Your Health Idaho


# Your Health Idaho



**Your Health Idaho**, sometimes known as the **Idaho Health Insurance Exchange**, is the health insurance marketplace for the U.S. state of Idaho. The exchange enables people and small businesses to purchase health insurance at federally subsidized rates.


## Background

Health insurance exchanges were established as a part of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to enable individuals to purchase health insurance in state-run marketplaces. In this legislation, states could choose to establish their own health insurance exchanges; if they choose not to do so, the federal government would run one for the state.

In 2014, Healthcare.gov will be responsible for enrolling consumers in on-exchange health plans in the state of Idaho.
