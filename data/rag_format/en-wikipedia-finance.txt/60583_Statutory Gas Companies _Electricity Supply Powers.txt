Statutory Gas Companies (Electricity Supply Powers) Act 1925


# Statutory Gas Companies (Electricity Supply Powers) Act 1925



The **Statutory Gas Companies (Electricity Supply Powers) Act 1925** (15 & 16 Geo. 5. c. 44) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which facilitated the supply of electricity by gas companies.


## Background

The spread of electricity supplies in rural areas in the UK had been limited because of the cost distribution infrastructure. Yet, the advantages of using electricity for lighting rather than gas were recognised. Gas companies were able to use surplus power from the gas making process to generate and supply electricity. Twenty-four gas companies had, by 1925, obtained legal powers to supply electricity. However, this required the company to promote a Bill in Parliament which was a prohibitive cost for smaller gas companies.

The aim of the Act was to enable Statutory Gas Companies to apply for Special Orders under the Electricity Acts. It enabled companies to raise capital or borrow money to provide an electricity supply. The Electricity Commissioners were empowered to grant money control powers to gas companies, including those already authorised to supply electricity.
