## Work

The main business of companies like Coutot-Roehrig is succession genealogy. The role of the succession genealogist is to locate living heirs and distribute the shares of the estate when there is uncertainty about the number or legitimacy of those entitled to a portion of the inheritance. This distribution is carried out according to the degrees of kinship between the heirs and the deceased, as well as in accordance with Articles 731 and following of the Civil Code.

The fee of the succession genealogist is to be paid by the identified heir. If the heir signs a contract with the company, the fee is a percentage (sometimes 35%) of the heir's share; otherwise, it only covers the 'useful and necessary' expenses of the company.
