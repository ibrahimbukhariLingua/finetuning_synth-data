In his book *Griftopia*, Matt Taibbi laid a substantial portion of the liquidity crisis at AIG directly on Neuger's doorstep. According to Taibbi, in Neuger's desire to increase profits, Neuger directed his unit to invest collateral from securities lending into mortgage-backed securities, a move which Taibbi described as "moronic".

AIG Global Investment Corporation was eventually sold to Pacific Century Group, and Neuger remained as CEO. He retired as the Vice Chairman of the company in 2013.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
