GTCO Group


# GTCO Group



**Guaranty Trust Holding Company PLC** also known as **GTCO PLC** is a multinational financial services group, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payments services, headquartered in Victoria Island, Lagos, Nigeria. GTCO Plc was created in July 2021 following the corporate reorganization of Guaranty Trust Bank PLC (or GTBank) into a Holding Company.

GTCO Plc's reorganisation means it will now offer more services beyond banking; with a payments business being top of mind for the group. Under its old structure, it could not have run non-lending businesses because a 2010 regulation by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) mandated banks to stop operating their non-banking subsidiaries. They either had to divest from non-core lending service or restructure as a holdings company.

Its new businesses include payments, pension management, asset management, and its existing banking business. GTCO's banking subsidiary in Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank Limited is Nigeria’s most valuable bank by market value with its most recent market valuation at N840.26 billion.

Guaranty Trust Holding Plc original started as Guaranty Trust Banks, and it was founded in 1988 by over 35 young Nigerians in their thirties, spearheaded mostly by Tayo Aderinokun and Fola Adeola, but also included Femi Pedro, Gbolade Osibodu, Femi Akingbe, Akin Opeodu, and others.

The Eurobond was issued under the US$2,000,000 Global Medium Term Note Programme, which is registered under both Regulation in the United States of America and Rule 144A in the United Kingdom and sold to investors across Africa, America, Asia and Europe.
