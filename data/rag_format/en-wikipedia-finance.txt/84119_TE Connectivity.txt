## History

In 1941, Aircraft and Marine Products (AMP) was founded with electrical connections lacking solder for quick and removable wire connection used for aircraft and ships. After the war time boom, the company had to adapt to the post-war economy, and in 1956, the name of the company was changed to AMP Incorporated when it incorporated. In 1999, Tyco International acquired AMP Incorporated.

In September 2002, the CEO (L. Dennis Kozlowski) and CFO (Mark H. Swartz) of Tyco International Ltd. were indicted on charges including fraud, racketeering, stock manipulation, and more, amounting to more than 600 million dollars of theft.

In July 2007, Tyco separated into three publicly independent companies, Covidien Ltd (formerly Tyco Healthcare), Tyco Electronics Ltd, and Tyco International Ltd (formerly Tyco Fire & Security and Tyco Engineered Products & Services (TFS/TEPS)).

In 2010, the company's Tyco Telecommunications division, which provided and installed submarine communications cables, was renamed to Tyco Electronics Subsea Communications.

On March 10, 2011, Tyco Electronics Ltd changed its name to TE Connectivity Ltd., which the company said felt more relevant to its position as a connectivity and sensor component manufacturer.

On August 28, 2015, TE Connectivity announced that it has completed the sale of its broadband-networks business to CommScope Holding Co. for about US$3 billion.
