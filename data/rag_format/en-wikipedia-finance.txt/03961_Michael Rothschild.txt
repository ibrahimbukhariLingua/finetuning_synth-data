Notably he wrote about decision-making under uncertainty through, 'Uncertainty in Economics: Readings and Exercises, *with Peter Diamond. This book synthesizes the traditional and modern thought associated with economic uncertainty. It provides understanding into three primary groups: theory of choice under uncertainty, general equilibrium models of financial institutions, and models of the effects of uncertainty on market institutions.*
