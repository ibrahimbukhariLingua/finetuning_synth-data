Redenomination


# Redenomination



In monetary economics, **redenomination** is the process of changing the face value of banknotes and coins in circulation. It may be done because inflation has made the currency unit so small that only large denominations of the currency are in circulation. In such cases the name of the currency may change or the original name may be used with a temporary qualifier such as "new". Redenomination may be done for other reasons such as changing over to a new currency such as the Euro or during decimalisation.

Redenomination itself is considered symbolic as it does not have any impact on a country's exchange rate in relation to other currencies. It may, however, have a psychological impact on the population by suggesting that a period of hyperinflation is over, and is not a reminder of how much inflation has impacted them. The reduction in the number of zeros also improves the image of the country abroad.

Inflation over time is the main cause for the purchasing power of the monetary unit decreasing; but there are a variety of political reasons for the government not reining in inflation or for not redenominating the currency when its value has depreciated significantly. There are some economic and social benefits of redenominating, including improved efficiency in processing routine transactions. Redenomination typically involves the substitution of new banknotes in place of the old ones, which usually cease being legal tender after the end of a short transition period.


## Inflation

In general, redenomination is implemented in response to hyperinflation, which progressively increases the nominal prices of products and services, decreasing the real value of the monetary unit in the local market. Over time, prices become excessively large, which can impede routine transactions because of the risk and inconvenience of carrying stacks of bills, or the strain on systems, e.g. automatic teller machines (ATMs), or because human psychology does not handle large numbers well. Authorities may alleviate this problem by redenomination: introducing a new unit that replaces the old unit, with a fixed number of old units being converted to 1 new unit. If inflation is the reason for redenomination, this ratio is much larger than 1, usually a positive integral power of 10 like 100, 1000 or 1 million, and the procedure can be referred to as "cutting zeroes". Recent examples of redenominations include:

| New unit | = | × | Old unit | Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Argentine peso (ARP) | = | 10 000 | Argentine peso ley (ARY) | 1983 |
| Argentine austral (ARA) | = | 1 000 | Argentine peso (ARP) | 1985 |
| Argentine peso (ARS) | = | 10 000 | Argentine austral (ARA) | 1992 |
| New Polish złoty (PLN) | = | 10 000 | old Polish złoty (PLZ) | 1995 |
| New Mozambican metical (MZN) | = | 1 000 | old metical (MZM) | 2006 |
| Second Zimbabwean dollar (ZWN) | = | 1 000 | first dollar (ZWD) | 2006 |
| Third Zimbabwean dollar (ZWR) | = | 10 000 000 000 | second dollar (ZWN) | 2008 |
| Fourth Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) | = | 1 000 000 000 000 | third dollar (ZWR) | 2009 |
| This table is not exhaustive. | | | | |

Although the ratio is often a positive integral power of 10 (i.e., removing some zeros), sometimes it can be *a*×10ⁿ where *a* is a single-digit integer and *n* is a positive integer. Partial examples include:

| New unit | = | × | Old unit | Year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| German Rentenmark | = | 1 000 billion | Papiermark | 1923 |
| Chinese gold yuan | = | 3 million | old yuan | 1948 |
| Chinese silver yuan [zh] | = | 500 million | Chinese gold yuan | 1949 |
| New Taiwan dollar | = | 40 000 | old dollar | 1949 |
| Azerbaijani new manat | = | 5 000 | old manat | 2006 |
| This table is not exhaustive. | | | | |

Occasionally, the ratio is defined in a way such that the new unit is equal to a hard currency. As a result, the ratio may not be based on an integer. Examples include:

| New unit | = | × | Old unit | = | Anchor currency | year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brazilian real | = | 2 750 | cruzeiros reais | = | United States dollar | 1 July 1994 |
| Yugoslav novi dinar | = | 10~13 million | 1994 dinara | = | Deutsche Mark | 24 January 1994 |
| 2nd Polish złoty | = | 1.8 million | Polish marka | = | Swiss franc | 1 April 1924 |
| This table is not exhaustive. | | | | | | |

In the case of hyperinflation, the ratio can go as high as millions or billions, to a point where scientific notation is used for clarity or long and short scales are mentioned to disambiguate which kind of billion or trillion is meant.

In the case of chronic inflation which is expected to continue, the authorities have a choice between a large redenomination ratio and a small redenomination ratio. If a small ratio is used, another redenomination may soon be required, which will entail costs in the financial, accounting, and computing industries. However a large ratio may result in inconveniently large or small prices at some point in the cycle.

After a redenomination, the new unit often has the same name as the old unit, with the addition of the word *new*. The word *new* may or may not be dropped a few years after the change. Sometimes the new unit is a completely new name, or a "recycled" name from previous redenomination or from ancient times.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

| New unit | = | × | Old unit | year | Nature of the new unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turkish new lira | = | 1 million | old lira | 2005 | "new" is an official designation and was dropped in 2009. |
| New Taiwan dollar | = | 40 000 | old dollars | 1949 | "new" is an official designation and is still used in official documents today. |
| Argentine austral | = | 1 000 | Peso argentino | 1985 | completely new name |
| Yugoslav 1993 dinar | = | 1 million | 1992 dinara | 1993 | no official designation |
| Brazilian real | = | 2 750 | cruzeiros reais | 1994 | recycled unit of Brazil before 1942 |
| This table is not exhaustive. | | | | | |


## Decimalisation

All countries that previously had currencies based on pounds-shillings-pence (£sd) system (£1 = 20 shillings = 240 pence) have now adopted decimal currencies (currencies related by powers of 10), with several changing the name of the main currency unit at the same time. As of 2020, only two currencies are non-decimal, being the Mauritanian ouguiya and Malagasy ariary, with one of each divided into five subdivisory units.


## Currency union

When countries form a currency union, redenomination may be required. The conversion ratio is often not a round number, and may be less than 1.

| New unit | = | x | Old unit | year | Monetary union |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Danish krone | = | 0.5 | Danish rigsdaler | 1873 | Scandinavian Monetary Union |
| Gulden österreichischer Währung | = | 20/21 | Gulden Conventions-Münze | 1858 | Wiener Münzvertrag between the states of the German Customs Union and the Austrian Empire |
| This table is not exhaustive. | | | | | |
