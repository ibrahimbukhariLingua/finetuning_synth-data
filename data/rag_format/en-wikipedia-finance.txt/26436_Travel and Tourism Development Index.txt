Travel and Tourism Development Index


# Travel and Tourism Development Index



The **Travel and Tourism Development Index** (**TTDI**), formerly known as the **Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index** (**TTCI**), is an index developed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to measure the attractiveness and potential of countries for investment and development in the travel and tourism sector, rather than its attractiveness purely as a tourist destination. First published in 2007 under the title ***Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report***, the index was rebranded as the TTDI starting with the 2021 report.

The TTDI evaluates countries based on their performance across three main subindexes: regulatory framework; business environment and infrastructure; and human, cultural, and natural resources. Countries are scored on a scale from 1 to 6 in these categories, with the aggregated results forming the overall index.

In addition to rankings, the report includes detailed country profiles, featuring key indicators sourced from organizations such as the World Bank, the World Tourism Organization, and the World Travel and Tourism Council.


## Variables

For the 2008 index, each of the three main subindexes is made of the scoring of the following 14 variables, called pillars in the TTC Report. Several changes were introduced in the 2008 TTCI in the definition of the variables as compared to the definitions of the 2007 TTCI. First, the “environmental regulation” pillar was improved with help from the IUCN and the UNWTO, and for the 2008 index was renamed the “environmental sustainability” pillar to “*better reflect its components and to capture the increasingly recognized importance of sustainability in the sector’s development*.” Second, the original pillar “natural and cultural resources” was divided into two separate subcomponents: “natural resources” and “cultural resources”, thus, allowing to differentiate those countries which do not necessarily have the same strengths or weaknesses in these two different resources. In general, the model was improved with better data and new concepts were introduced. The 2009 and 2011 reports kept the same 14 variables.
