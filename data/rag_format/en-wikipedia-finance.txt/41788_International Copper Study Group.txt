International Copper Study Group


# International Copper Study Group



The **International Copper Study Group** (**ICSG**) is an intergovernmental organisation of copper producing and consuming States that functions as the international commodity board for copper. Its main purpose is to increase copper market transparency and promote international discussions and cooperation on issues related to copper. ICSG member States represent approximately 85 percent of world copper mine production, refined production and usage.

The creation of the ICSG was negotiated in 1989 in Geneva and was agreed to in a multilateral treaty known as the 'Agreement Establishing the Terms of Reference of the International Copper Study Group'. The ICSG came into existence on 23 January 1992, with the secretariat headquarters located in Lisbon, Portugal, which also hosts the International Nickel Study Group and the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.

The Study Group has three main objectives:

* To promote market transparency by encouraging the exchange of information on production, usage, stocks, trade, and prices of copper, by forecasting production and usage, and by assessing the present and future capacities of copper mines, plants, smelters and refineries.
* To enhance international cooperation on matters related to copper, such as health and the environment, research, technology transfer, regulations and trade.
* The provision of a global forum where industry and governments can meet and discuss common problems/objectives. The ICSG is the only inter-governmental forum solely dedicated to copper.

The ICSG maintains one the most exhaustive and complete statistical databases on copper and publishes monthly Bulletins containing highly detailed statistical data on copper mine, smelter and refinery production, copper usage, stocks, prices and trade. The Group also publishes comprehensive information on operating and planned mines, smelters and refineries around the world as well as an annual Directory regarding the current status of copper semi-fabricator plants.

Meetings of the Group's member States' delegates and industry representatives are held on a twice yearly basis, usually in April and October.

The ICSG World Copper Factbook provides a concise and up-to-date overview of the global copper market. This is available free of charge on the ICSG website.
