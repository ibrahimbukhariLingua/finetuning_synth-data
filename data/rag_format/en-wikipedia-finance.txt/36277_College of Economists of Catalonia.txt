The **College of Economists of Catalonia**, officially named in Catalan ***Col·legi d'Economistes de Catalunya**,* based in Barcelona, is a professional public law corporation, which in 2022 had more than 7,800 members and 1,500 related companies and offices dedicated to the different aspects of the economy, business and entrepreneurship.


## History

The College of Economists of Catalonia is the result of the unification of the former College of Economists and the extinct Colleges of Mercantile and Business Degrees of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona as well as the Council of Associations of Mercantile and Business Degrees of Catalonia. The unified organisation was formally established on October 1, 2014, when the Extraordinary Constituent Assembly took place.

Initially, this entity was a section of the College of Graduates of the political, economic and commercial sciences specialties in Barcelona, in 1954. Later, it was segregated as a proper college of economists from Catalonia and the Balearic Islands with branches in Tarragona, Lleida and Girona. The delegation of the Balearic Islands was segregated in 1978.

The college has had as deans Joaquim Buxó-Dulce de Abaigar, Josep Maria Berini, Llorenç Gascón, Lluís Burgués, Francesc Raventós, Rafael Suñol, Francesc Santacana, Andreu Morillas, Valentí Pich, Jordi Conejos, Artur Saurí, Joan B. Casas (2008–2018), Anton Gasol (2018–2021), Oriol Amat (2021) and, from November 2021, Carles Puig de Travy.


## Services

The organisation is configured as a training and professional updating center and as a forum of opinion open to society in general, through the organization of activities and the provision of services. As the highest representative body of the profession in Catalonia, the College of Economists of Catalonia has as its main objective to promote the development of professions linked to the economy and business and to ensure that professional activities offer society guarantees of quality and competence. The college has offices in Barcelona (Plaça de Gal·la Placídia, 32), Girona (Carrer Joan Maragall 44–46), Lleida (Carrer Pere Cabrera 16) and Tarragona (Rambla Nova 58–60).
