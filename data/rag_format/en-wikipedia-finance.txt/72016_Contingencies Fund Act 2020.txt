Contingencies Fund Act 2020


# Contingencies Fund Act 2020



The **Contingencies Fund Act 2020** (c. 6) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was created to increase the maximum capital of the United Kingdom's contingency fund from 2%, as set out in Section 1 of the Contingencies Fund Act 1974, to 50%. It was introduced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Background

The Contingencies Fund was established in 1862 by HM Treasury. It originally consisted of a fixed amount of capital which was increased over time and by 1945 had reached £1.5 million. Before this legislation, the Contingencies Fund Act 1974 required that the permanent capital of the fund not exceed 2% of the authorised supply expenditure of the previous financial year. The fund provides cash loans to government departments.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, this legislation raises the limit to 50%. This allowed government departments to be funded for extra spending prior to the next set of spending estimates coming before Parliament. Once the spending is approved the contingency fund would be repaid.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
