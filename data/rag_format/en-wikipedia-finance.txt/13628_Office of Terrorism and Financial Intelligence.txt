The **Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence** (**TFI**), formed in 2004, is an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury. TFI works to protect the U.S. financial system from misuse by terrorists, money launderers, drug cartels, and other national security threats.

TFI is headed by the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
