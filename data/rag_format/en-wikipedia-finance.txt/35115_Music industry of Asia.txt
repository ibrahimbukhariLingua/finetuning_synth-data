## History


### Early history

Korean modern pop music firstly appeared in 1915, affected by Filipino pop songs. Since Japanese colonial authorities needed to restrict all forms of art in Korea, Korean rarely had the opportunity to establish their own modern music style. In the early 1920s, the recording industry emerged in Shanghai, China. Japanese pop music originated in the Showa Period, which was the heyday of Jazz music.


### Modernization Period

The development of Japanese music industry was hindered by World War II. Subsequently, when Japan was occupied by the US, the US military played music such as boogie-woogie, mambo, blues ,and country music, introducing new music styles to Japan. In 1948, the ‘Tokyo boogie-woogie’, Chiemi Eri's ‘Tennessee Waltz’, Misora Hibari's ‘Omatsuri Mambo’ and ‘Omoide no Waltz’ became the representative songs, and they were published as music records. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music was weakening in the mainland of China due to the introduction of Soviet music.


### Recent Development

And the 1990s were the heyday of J-pop when many records in the music market were broken. Sales revenue was more than 400 billion yen (around 2.7 Billion US dollars) in 1991, 500 billion yen in 1993, and reached an unsurpassed point of 607.5 billion yen in 1998. Music market expansion also brought music style diversification and strong competition. From 1995 to 1997, three major entertainment companies in South Korea (S.M.Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment), were founded. In the first decade of the 21st century, music brands like BoA, TVXQ, Shinhwa, Super Junior, BigBang, Wonder Girls, Girls' Generation, 2AM, 2PM, emerged one after another, jointly creating the golden age of k-pop idols. At this stage, Korean entertainment companies were more systematic and professional in the idol industry. Underground artists also contributed to hip-hop mainstream. Kim Bum-soo was the first South Korean artist to reach the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and no. 51 in 2001. In 2005, "You are my rose", the first mobile album in China, completely broke the traditional marketing mode released through CD, store, network and other channels.

Naming the online streaming service "radio" is not as familiar to new media as it is in the us.
