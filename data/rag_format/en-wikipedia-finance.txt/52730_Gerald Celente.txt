## Forecasting

Gerald Celente runs a website for financial related content where events are "forecasted" with unknown partners and financial backing offering real world commentary and a service to, "monetize your social media, blog, database, or even your social circle." ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Hugo Lindgren and ABC News have labelled Celente's predictions "pessimism porn" for their stark pessimism and for the imagined/alleged eschatological "thrill" or opportunity some people might receive from imagining his predictions of the collapse of civil society in the wake of a global economic crisis.

His forecasts since 1993 have included predictions about terrorism, economic collapses and war. More recent forecasts involve fascism in the United States, food riots and tax revolts. Celente has long predicted global anti-Americanism, a failing economy and immigration woes in the U.S.

In 2009 Celente predicted turmoil from the upcoming election of Barack H. Obama.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

He was a popular guest on conservative cable-TV talk-shows such as *Fox News Sunday* and Glenn Beck's television program.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In April 2009 Celente wrote, "Wall Street controls our financial lives; the media manipulates our minds. These systems cannot be changed from within. There is no alternative. Without a revolution, these institutions will bankrupt the country, keep fighting failed wars, start new ones, and hold us in perpetual intellectual subjugation."

Celente has said, "smaller communities, the smaller groups, the smaller states, the more self-sustaining communities, will 'weather the crisis in style' as big cities and hypertrophic suburbias descend into misery and conflict", and forecasts "a downsizing of America".
