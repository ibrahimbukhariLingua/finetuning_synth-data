The **economy of the Arab League** is the economy of the member states of the Arab League. The economy has traditionally been dependent on exports of oil and natural gas; however, the tourism sector has grown rapidly, becoming the fastest-growing sector in the region. The Greater Arab Free Trade Area, founded in 1997, is the league's free trade area which removed customs taxes on 65% of trade between counties in the Arab World.:

Members of the Arab League are among the richest and poorest of the world, and there is a great disparity in the economic development of members of the league. There is a significant difference imbalance in wealth between the Gulf states, which include Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and war-torn nations within the league, such as: Syria, Iraq and Yemen.:
