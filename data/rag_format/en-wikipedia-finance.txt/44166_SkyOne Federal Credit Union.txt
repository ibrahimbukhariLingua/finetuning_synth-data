# SkyOne Federal Credit Union



**SkyOne Federal Credit Union** is an American credit union that focuses on employees working in the aeronautics and space sector and their relatives. The credit union is headquartered in Hawthorne, California and is federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration and is an Equal Housing Lender. It offers financial services to all who qualify.


## History

SkyOne Federal Credit Union was founded in July 1949 as CAA First Federal Credit Union with eight members to serve the Civil Aeronautics Administration employees and their dependents. In 1978, the credit union changed its name from CAA to FAA and was serving FAA employees in 13 Western states.

In January 2010 FAA First FCU again changed its name to SkyOne FCU in order to reflect as a nationwide brand. The new branding helped the credit union to better identify with its membership open to those working in the air transportation industry. In 2008, SkyOne partnered with the United Insurance Partners to give its members access to purchase auto, homeowner and RV insurance from more than 15 insurance providers at competitive rates.

As of 2024, SkyOne FCU had $1 Billion in assets, and over 60,000 members worldwide.


## Membership

SkyOne's field of membership is set by the National Credit Union Administration. As with all credit unions, membership in SkyOne used to be limited to individuals sharing the common bond defined in its credit union charter. Membership in SkyOne is no longer limited to air transportation employees and their dependents who live and work in the United States. Anyone in good standing with ChexSystems can join by selecting either CA PTA, Surfrider Foundation, American Consumer Council, or Friends of Madrona Marsh when applying.
