## History

Kudelski Group was founded in 1951 by Stefan Kudelski, while he was an engineering student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne - EPFL). The company's first product was the Nagra I, a reel-to-reel tape recorder, which weighed 11 pounds and measured 5"x7"x12" (roughly the size of a shoe box). It was succeeded by the Nagra II in 1953, which improved sound quality with additional mechanical filters.

Kudelski released the Nagra III tape recorder in 1958, which could synchronize sound with the frames on a reel of film, which became popular for on-location filming. It was used by directors including François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and D. A. Pennebaker. The Nagra SN, or Série Noir, was released in 1970, which was originally designed for use by the United States Secret Service. Kudelski later expanded into television services, providing its access control system for pay television to Canal+ in 1989.

André Kudelski replaced his father, Stefan Kudelski, as chief executive officer in 1991 following pressure from investors.

In 2001, Kudelski Group entered the Public Access sector with the acquisition of SKIDATA, an Austrian company specialised in access systems for people and vehicles.

OpenTV, an internet and digital television company was fully acquired by the Kudelski Group on March 29, 2010.

Kudelski Group entered the cybersecurity sector with the creation in 2012 of Kudelski Security. In order to identify and remediate cyber-attacks, Kudelski Security operates Cyber Fusion Centers in Switzerland, Spain and the United States.

In 2016, the company opened a second headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona. The same year, it launched Insight, the Group's artificial intelligence and big data business performance platform.

Kudelski IoT was created in 2017, together with the launch of the Group's Internet of Things Security Center of Excellence to address demand for increased protection of connected devices.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
