**Archon Information Systems**, L.L.C. (“Archon”) is a Delaware corporation that provides technology and collection services to government clients.

The focus of Archon's services is the collection and management of delinquent ad valorem taxes, which are local governments' major source of revenue. Software development is the core of Archon’s business model, and utilizes the test-driven development design method. The company's best-known software products are the CivicSource brand of proprietary software, including CivicSource Administrator (for management of property taxes) and CivicSource Auctioneer (for conducting Internet-based tax and foreclosure sales). Archon's first major client, the City of New Orleans, used the company's software and services to host multiple online tax sales. The first of these was the first online tax sale in the Gulf South region, and the first tax sale held in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans netted increased revenue in property tax collection over previous sales to date.


## History

With corporate headquarters in New Orleans, Louisiana, Archon has representatives in states across the U.S. focused on outreach to local governments. Archon was founded in January 2008 by three professionals native to New Orleans, Louisiana. Bryan P. Barrios, chief executive officer, had been working in the legal field, specifically with local tax collections, for 12 years with a law firms in the City of New Orleans at Archon's formation. Barrios has drafted several pieces of legislation for both New Orleans and for the Louisiana State Legislature relative to the area of municipal tax collections, including the provision pertaining to online tax sales in Archon's home state.

Sossamon had been working in technology for over 12 years, and had worked on technology projects and contracts with multiple Fortune 500 companies before creating Archon.
