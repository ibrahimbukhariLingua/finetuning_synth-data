## Early life

Grandhi Mallikarjuna Rao was born on 14 July 1950, in Rajam, Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, India.

He soon entered the trading of commodities, as his mother had insisted. After developing good relations with suppliers and customers in the business of commodities trading, he acquired a failing jute mill at a bargain, this venture proved to be lucrative and allowed GM Rao to use this leverage from local banks to acquire other assets. Eventually, GM Rao divested his stake in a multitude of industries and started a bank named Vysya Bank in collaboration with ING.

Rao eventually diluted his stake in ING Vysya by selling his stake in whole for 340 crores. The cash from the bank stake sale allowed his entry into the power business allowed Rao to build what would become India leading infrastructure asset developer, as GMR's most relevant competitor, GVK, is 6 times smaller by market capitalization, making GMR Group the leader in India as an airport developer by revenues, asset size, and market capitalization.
