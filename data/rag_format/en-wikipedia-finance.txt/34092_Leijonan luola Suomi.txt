Leijonan luola Suomi


# Leijonan luola Suomi



***Leijonan luola Suomi*** (English: Lion's Den Finland) is a Finnish version of American business reality TV show *Shark Tank*, based on the *Dragons' Den* format.

The first season began to air on 11 September, 2023 on Nelonen channel and Ruutu, and the second season in February of 2025.

It is the third Finnish adaptation of the format, after *Leijonan kita [fi] (Lion's Mouth)* in 2007 and *Leijonan luola [fi] (Lion's Den)* in 2013-2018.


## Concept

The show features a panel of potential investors, termed as "Lions", who listen to entrepreneurs' pitch ideas for a business or product they wish to develop. These multi-millionaires judge the concepts and products pitched and then decide whether they invest their money to help market and mentor each contestant. The entrepreneurs have only half an hour to convince the "Lions" that it is profitable to invest to this company.


## Lions

Six big Finnish entrepreneurs are ready to invest their own money for hopeful companies and help them to grow.

For the second season, two new Lions; Inka Mero and Roni Bäck joined the cast, while Noora Fagerström, Jari Sarasvuo and Sami Hedberg exited.
