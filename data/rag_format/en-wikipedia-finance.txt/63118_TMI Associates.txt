**TMI Associates** (TMI総合法律事務所, *TMI Sōgō Hōritsu Jimusho*) is one of the five largest law firms in Japan.

The firm was founded in 1990 by ten intellectual property specialists who left the law firm of Nishimura & Partners. It grew quickly in ensuing years, with 33 attorneys as of 1998 and more than 600 domestic and foreign attorneys and patent attorneys as of 2020. https://www.tmi.gr.jp/about/organization.html

The firm has joint ventures with the American law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, the British law firm of Simmons & Simmons and the German law firm of ARQIS Rechtsanwälte.
