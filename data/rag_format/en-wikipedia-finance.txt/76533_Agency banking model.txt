Agency banking model


# Agency banking model



The **agency banking model** is a function of certain commercial banks in Kenya. The activity is regulated by the Central Bank of Kenya, which allows banks to contract third-party retail networks as a Banking agent. Upon successful application, vetting, and approval,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ these agents are authorized to offer selected products and services on behalf of the bank.


## Definition

A banking agent in Kenya is a commercial entity that has been contracted by a commercial bank and approved by the Central Bank of Kenya to provide specific services on behalf of the bank. This entity is equipped with the skills necessary to provide basic banking services according to standards set by the Bank.

This allows the banking agent entity to access financial products and services at a location nearest to the customer, thus breaking down certain barriers to financial inclusion such as cost and accessibility.

* Document collection for debit and credit cards, loan applications, and account opening
* Collecting bank correspondence and mail
* Mobile banking services

Agency banking transactions are denominated in Kenyan shillings.
