## Business units


### BWXT mPower, Inc.

BWXT announced in 2009 plans to design, develop, license and deploy a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) called the BWXT mPower reactor. The passively safe reactor would have had an output of 180 megawatts (electric) and was one of several SMRs investigated by U.S. engineering firms. The mPower reactor featured a fully underground containment structure.

BWXT mPower, Inc. was formed in 2012 to design, develop, license, and deploy the B&W mPower reactor, a small modular nuclear reactor. The BWXT mPower reactor – no longer in development as of 2017 – was a scalable, modular reactor with the capacity to provide output in increments of 180 MWe for a four-year operating cycle without refueling. The business unit was headquartered in Charlotte, NC.

The reactor design was an integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) system in which the nuclear core and steam generators were contained within a single vessel.

B&W and engineering and construction firm Bechtel maintained an alliance called Generation mPower LLC to produce modular nuclear power plants using the BWXT mPower reactor until the project was terminated in 2017.

More than two dozen utilities belonged to the Generation mPower Industry Advisory Council and provided review, insights and feedback regarding licensing and design activities for the BWXT mPower reactor. In 2013 the Tennessee Valley Authority signed a letter of intent to potentially build plants utilizing BWXT mPower reactors.
