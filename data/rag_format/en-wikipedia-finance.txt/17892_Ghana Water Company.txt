Ghana Water Company


# Ghana Water Company



**Ghana Water Company** (formerly **Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation**, **Aqua Vitens**, and **Rand Limited**) is the majority provider of water utility services in Ghana.


## History

In the pre-colonial era, inhabitants of what is now Ghana primarily drew their water directly from natural sources such as streams, lakes, and rivers. Prior to World War I, the first public water system was established in the then Gold coast by the British who were then colonizing the Gold Coast. In by that time the 1920s, other major towns and cities started having water systems which were built purposely to be used in some urban areas, including Winneba, Kumasi, and the then colonial capital Cape Coast.

Ghana Water Company Limited was established on 1 July 1999, following the conversion of Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation into a state-owned limited liability company under the Statutory Corporations (Conversion to Companies) Act 461 of 1993 as amended by LI 1648.


## Governance Structure

The Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources oversees water policies, GWCL operations, funding, and sector investments.

Guided by the Ministry, GWCL operates under an 11-member Board of Directors setting policies and a Managing Director overseeing day-to-day affairs along with three Deputy Managing Directors for Finance, Operations, and Special Projects.

Supported by 17 Chief Managers, these leaders oversee departments including Project Planning, Human Resources, Legal, Communications, Finance, Operations, and more at the Head Office. Unit Heads support the 15 Regional Chief Managers, while District Managers oversee GWCL districts nationwide. GWCL Ventures into the Packaged Water Industry after the reorganization of GWCL, which involved the merger of Ghana Water Company Limited and Ghana Urban Water Limited (GUWL) in 2013, the management of GWCL discussed the concept of producing bottled water. The Special Business Unit (SBU) was formed to set up a water bottling plant, and later in 2015, the Business Development Unit (BDU) took over this role to concentrate on expanding GWCL's water packaging business.

After the official bidding procedure, the construction contract for the water bottling plant was awarded to Blessedfields Limited. Construction began in November 2017, and commercial production started in December 2018. The oversight of the G-Water Bottling Plant is in the hands of a General Manager.
