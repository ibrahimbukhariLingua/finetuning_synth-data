Marketing decision support system


# Marketing decision support system



A **marketing decision support system** (sometimes abbreviated **MKDSS**) is a decision support system for marketing activity. The system is used to help businesses explore different scenarios by manipulating already collected data from past events. It consists of information technology, marketing data, systems tools, and modeling capabilities that enable it to provide predicted outcomes from different scenarios and marketing strategies. MKDSS assists decision makers in different scenarios and can be a very helpful tool for a business to take over their competitors.


## Example

A MKDSS is used to support the software vendors’ planning strategy for marketing products. It can help to identify advantageous levels of pricing, advertising spending, and advertising copy for the firm’s products. This helps determine the firm's marketing mix for product software.


## Decision support systems

The concepts involved in decision support systems were first expressed in the early 1970s by Scott Morton. These systems are used to help solve complex problems by using computer technology and can help businesses with decision making. DSS has progressed since it was first developed in the 70's. The main areas of research that DDS has developed from are theoretical and technological.

There are three types of DSS available: 1. available as a software application, 2. bespoke and 3. user-developed.

DSS has many tools that contain different functions such as; sophisticated database management capabilities with access to internal and external data. information, and knowledge; powerful modeling functions accessed by a model management system; and powerful, yet simple user interface designs that enable interactive queries, reporting, and graphing functions.

Although DSS have many different functions, they are very user friendly and easy to use, flexible and have strong graphic capabilities.


## Use of decision support systems
