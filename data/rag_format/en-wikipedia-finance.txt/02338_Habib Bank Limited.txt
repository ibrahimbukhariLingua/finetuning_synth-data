## History

Habib Bank Limited was established as a public limited company in Bombay in 1941 by the Habib family, previously engaged in internal trade and private banking. The bank's founding was influenced by the revitalization of Muslim politics by Muhammad Ali Jinnah in 1936, prompting the Habibs to challenge the existing Hindu-British dominance in the banking industry. Supported by Jinnah and the All India Muslim League, Habib Bank aided the Muslim League, subsequently serving as the appointed banker for the Muslim League Fund, the Pakistan Fund, and the Quaid-e-Azam Bihar Relief Fund. Relations between Jinnah and Mahomedali Habib, a key figure in the bank, were notably close. In 1937, under Mahomedali's influence, the Habib family converted from Isma'ilism to Isnasheri Shia Islam, aligning religiously more closely with Jinnah.

In early 1947, at Jinnah's request, the bank's headquarters were relocated to Karachi on August 7, 1947, just before the Partition of India. It was done to facilitate the transfer of Muslim assets to Pakistan, aiding both individual depositors and larger accounts. The bank played a crucial role in the economic framework of newly independent Pakistan.

The Habib family owned and managed the bank until the Pakistan government nationalised it on 1 January 1974. The Habib family received compensation of PKR 36.31 per share from the Government of Pakistan and subsequently the bank was delisted from the Karachi Stock Exchange.

On 13 June 2002, Pakistan's Privatisation Commission announced that the Government of Pakistan would grant the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED), a subsidiary of the Aga Khan Development Network, majority ownership of HBL against AKFED's investment in the bank.

In 2002, HBL's UK operation came close to being shut down due to regulatory issues with the Financial Services Authority. The problem was resolved by converting the operations to a subsidiary. Then Habib Bank Limited and Allied Bank of Pakistan merged their operations (Habib contributed its six branches and Allied its four branches) into a new bank, called Habib-Allied International Bank, in which Habib Bank has a 90.5% shareholding, while Allied Bank has 9.5%.

In December 2003, the Government of Pakistan granted AKFED rights to 51% of the shareholding in the bank against an investment of PKR 22.409 billion (US$389 million). In February 2004, Government of Pakistan handed over management control of Habib Bank to AKFED. The Board of Directors was reconstituted to have four AKFED nominees, including the Chairman and the President/CEO, and three Government of Pakistan nominees.

In 2013, the bank acquired Citibank Pakistan consumer business for Rs. 2 billion.

In April 2015, the Government of Pakistan sold its 41.5% stake or 609 million shares in the bank for $1.02 billion. According to the finance ministry, the strike price of Rs. 168 per share (compared to the floor price of Rs. 166 per share) was recommended by the Privatisation Commission Board. The bank's owners now comprise the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (51%), and the remaining 49% of shares are in free float. CDC Group holds 4.99%, and the International Finance Corporation holds 0.87%, while individuals, institutions, and funds hold the rest of the shares.

In June 2015, the bank acquired Barclays's Pakistan operations and absorbed the staff.

On 18 April 2016, HBL received a licence to operate a subsidiary in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, becoming the first Pakistani bank to operate in China.

In February 2018, HBL appointed senior banker Muhammad Aurangzeb (formerly CEO of Global Corporate Bank – Asia Pacific at JP Morgan) as its President & CEO following the early retirement of Nauman K. Dar on 31 December 2017, after the bank was marred by a penalty of $225 Million (USD) for its non-compliance with risk management and anti-money laundering rules.

In 2020, HBL was designated one of the domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB) of the year by the State Bank of Pakistan.

## DFS Investigation

In September 2017, HBL agreed to pay a fine of $225 million in an out-of-court settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) against 53 separate violations allegedly committed between 2007 and 2017.

Following this, HBL shares surged 5 percent, to ₨.160.58 per share, amid investor relief that the fine was not larger than $225 million. The penalty, however, is the largest ever imposed upon a Pakistani financial institution. HBL had already agreed to surrender its licence to operate a branch in New York that had been operational since 1978.

The DFS had earlier sought up to $630m in penalties from HBL for failing to comply with state and federal laws at its only U.S. branch. According to The Nation, compliance issues dated back to 2015 when the DFS told Karachi-listed Habib Bank (HBL) to institute a series of reforms about the bank's policies for preventing illicit money transfers. In a December 2015 statement, the DFS identified issues in the bank's anti-money laundering compliance.

Habib also allegedly cleared transactions to a cybercriminal wanted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Chinese weapons manufacturer that was subject to US sanctions. Since Habib's New York operations were used to clear dollar-denominated transactions, the bank is required to follow US "know your customer" rules and sanctions law.


## Allegations of terror financing

On 28 September 2022, a New York district court passed an order under the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act placing secondary liability on Habib Bank Limited as a party that "aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism". The plaintiff claimed that between 2010 and 2019, the bank had aided and abetted Al-Qaeda terrorism and had participated in a conspiracy to launch attacks in Afghanistan that killed or injured 370 people. In response, HBL released a statement claiming the accusations were "meritless" and that the bank was fiercely and thoroughly contesting them.
