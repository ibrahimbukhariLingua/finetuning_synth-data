## History


### Origins of WSP

*Williams Sale Partnership* was established in 1969 in England by Chris Cole, Geoffrey Williams, John Sale, and Geoffrey Middleton. In 1976, it was a founding member of the Building Services Research and Information Association (BSRIA). It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1987.

In the 1990s, the company expanded both domestically and internationally, forming *WSP Asia* in 1995, incorporating Graham Group and *T P O'Sullivan and Partners* in 1997, acquiring US practices *Cantor Seinuk* and *Flack + Kurtz* in 2000, as well as buying *Jacobson & Widmark* (J&W) in Sweden in 2001 (J&W was founded in 1938), *LT Consultants Oyj* and *EMP Projects Oyj* in Finland in 2003 and *PHB Group* in the UAE in 2005.


### Genivar

After acquiring three firms and expanding geographically in 1993, the name of the Canadian firm GBGM was changed to Genivar Inc.

In August 2011, Genivar Inc. and Montreal-based architectural firm ARCOP announced an alliance.


### Takeover

On 7 June 2012, Genivar made a friendly takeover cash offer of £278 million (C$442 million) for WSP Group plc, headquartered in London. The offer was backed by WSP's board of directors as well as investors holding 37% of the company's shares, and the takeover was completed on 1 August 2012. This merger created a professional-services firm with approximately 15,000 employees, working in over 300 offices worldwide.

The company reorganised its corporate structure on 1 January 2014, to create a parent company named WSP Global Inc. and adopted the common brand of WSP.


### Subsequent acquisitions

In October 2014, WSP completed the purchase of New York-headquartered professional services firm Parsons Brinckerhoff from Balfour Beatty for US$1.24 billion. The company has a network of approximately 170 offices and nearly 13,500 employees on five continents and became a wholly owned independent subsidiary. Together, WSP | Parsons Brinckerhoff is one of the largest professional services firms in the world with approximately 32,000 employees in 500 offices serving 39 countries.
