### Critical reception

Tim Dowling of *The Guardian* said the series "was not enhanced by Caroline Aherne's jokey narration, and it had more than its fair share of isn't-he-a-character type characters, but it was saved for me by a surprising discovery: the pound shop business is actually pretty interesting." *Metro*'s Caroline Westbrook said it "certainly didn't disappoint". *Bath Chronicle* called the narration "lacklustre" and commented on how boring the series was. Andrew Billen from *The Times* gave the programme three stars out of five. *The Sunday Times* said "Full marks to the makers of this documentary, who find a clever and absorbing way to tell the story of the biggest current trend on Britain's high streets."
