## Trading Career Debut and History

As a young man in England, Ruparelia successfully established a number of small businesses before returning to Uganda in the 1980s to take advantage of the improving political and business stability.

Sudhir started Ruparelia Group as a small trading firm in 1985 at 29 years of age with US$25,000 he returned with as savings accumulated from several jobs in the UK where his family had sought asylum after expulsion of Indians from Uganda.

As a result of the 5-year civil war, the breweries of Uganda had been ruined which made it rewarding to import beer, with household goods, from Kenya. Sudhir opened a wholesale store, in Kampala’s central business district, dealing in imported beer, salt and wine In December 1986 and struck a coup when he acquired the sole rights to distribute Kenya’s most premium beer brands in Uganda along with importing alcoholic beverages, Ruparelia also capitalized on importing commodities like salt, sugar and cigarettes from traders at the Mombasa ports. He positioned himself as a channel between importers and retailers and became a trusted business partner to the importers, who supplied him the items on credit and claimed payments after a couple of days, to accelerate returns. He ran the system effectively and set up the first solid distribution structure in Kampala and became the number one dealer in imported beer in Kampala.


## Establishing Crane Forex Bureau and Crane Bank

At the time, the vast majority of Sudhir’s customers were foreign nationals who paid for their stock in foreign currency. Sudhir spotted opportunity. He quickly formed an informal foreign exchange business. It was then unexploited market in Uganda and although the sector then operated informally the demand was overwhelming and the business became an immediate success from which Sudhir was making daily profits of about $10,000. He started investing part of the proceeds in prime properties in Kampala. In 1989, President Yoweri Museveni banned the importation of beer in an effort to encourage indigenous manufacturing of alcohol but Sudhir was not interested in producing beer and decided to focus on his informal Forex business instead.

By 1990, the forex businesses had bourgeoned in Uganda and the government moved in with a regulatory policy to govern them hence introducing licensing requirements in order to operate. Sudhir’s Crane Forex bureau became the first to be licensed in Uganda and within 6 months, he had started making more money than the commercial banks in the country . The said banks were operating incompetently with arrogance as if they were doing customers a favour, on top of charging exorbitant interest rates yet there were limited choices. This caused much frustration to Sudhir who was a customer propelling him to create a bank with professionalism in operations and charging low interest rates and in 1995 he started and launched Crane bank with USD$1 million and came up with a motto for his new bank: Serving To Grow And Growing To Serve.

He lowered bank charges and extended banking hours, becoming the first commercial bank to operate up to 5 pm and on Saturdays. The bank won the Banker of the Year awards in: 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 by the Financial Times in London.
