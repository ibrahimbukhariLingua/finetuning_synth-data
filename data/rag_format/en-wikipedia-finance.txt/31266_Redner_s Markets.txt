## History

Redner's Markets was founded in March 1970, by Mary (1918–2007) and Earl Redner (1926–2017). They opened two supermarkets in Reading, PA.

In 1975, the company formed an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), making them the first supermarket in Pennsylvania to be employee owned.

In March 1987 the company opened its first Warehouse Market location. All its supermarkets were converted to the warehouse style by November 1987.

In October 1990, Earl Redner retired and Richard and Gary W. Redner took over management of the company. Mary Redner died in 2007. Gary W. Redner was murdered in 2008 in a still unsolved homicide.
Earl Redner died in 2017.

The company is currently managed by Richard along with third generation Ryan Redner and Gary M. Redner.

In 2020, Redner's Warehouse Markets celebrated their 50th anniversary.


## Divisions

Redner's operations are organized into three divisions: Redner's Warehouse Market, Redner's Fresh Market and Redner's Quick Shoppe. The total number of Redner's locations is 64.


### Redner's Warehouse Market

**Redner's Warehouse Markets**, also known as **Redner's**, are warehouse-style markets without the need of a store club membership fee. Most locations range from 40,000 and 59,000 square feet (3,700 and 5,500 square meters) in store size. These stores stock general merchandise and a full-service supermarket, selling products such as meat and poultry, baked goods, delicatessen, frozen foods, dairy products, garden produce, and fresh seafood. As of May 20, 2021, there were 42 Redner's Warehouse Market locations in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland.


### Redner's Fresh Market

**Redner's Fresh Markets** are more conventional supermarkets and are slightly smaller than the size of a Redner's Warehouse Market. These stores offer beer & wine café, full-service food and grocery, and beauty aids/non-foods. As of May 20, 2021, there were 3 Redner's Fresh Markets. The first location opened in the fall of 2019 in Reading, with two more locations (one in Audubon and one in Bel Air, Maryland) opening soon after. There were originally expansion plans to bring the Redner's Fresh Market store concept to a larger amount of existing stores, but these plans were scrapped due to the cost of store upgrades and national labor shortages.


### Redner's Quick Shoppe

**Redner's Quick Shoppe** is a combined gas station and convenience store. Some Redner's Quick Shoppe locations offer Automatic Car Washes and Diesel. As of May 20, 2021, there were 20 Redner's Quick Shoppes.
