TIIE


# TIIE



**TIIE** (Spanish: ***Tasa de inter√©s interbancaria de equilibrio***, English *Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate*) is a reference rate for the currency Mexican peso. The TIIE is a representative rate of credit operations between banks and is calculated by the Bank of Mexico.


## History

In March 1995 the Bank of Mexico decided to publish the TIIE, in order to establish an interbank rate that reflects market conditions.

For this purpose, a procedure was established according to which the Bank of Mexico determines the TIIE with quotes presented by the credit institutions.
