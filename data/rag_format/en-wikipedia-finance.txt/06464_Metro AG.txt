Metro AG


# Metro AG



**Metro AG** is a German multinational company based in Düsseldorf which operates business membership-only cash and carry stores primarily under the Metro brand. As of September 2024, Metro is operating 624 wholesale stores in 21 countries, including Europe and Pakistan.

The company was established in 1964 by Ernst Schmidt and Wilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck. In 2010, it was the fourth-largest retailer in the world measured by revenues, after Walmart, Carrefour and Tesco. Until 2020, it was also active in the general retail business through the Real division, which was sold to an investor consortium. Its current incarnation was launched in 2017 as a spun-off of old Metro AG, which continued to be a consumer electronics retailer and renamed itself Ceconomy.


## History

In 1966, Otto Beisheim met Friedrich Wilhelm Lenz, chairman of the management board of Franz Haniel & Cie. and convinced him to invest in Metro. In the course of the following reorganization Beisheim became a shareholder himself. From this point on, the founding family Schmidt-Ruthenbeck and the shareholders Beisheim and Haniel each held about one third of the shares.

Under the sole leadership of Otto Beisheim, a rapid expansion of the Metro stores into the greater German and European area began in 1967 with the opening of the Metro stores in Godorf near Cologne, Hamburg, Munich and, after a connection with the Dutch company SHV Holdings, the first C&C wholesale store (brand: Makro) in the Netherlands, and in 1968 in Düsseldorf.

In 2005, Metro split off the Praktiker home improvement division, which went public as an independent company.

In July 2006 Metro bought the 85 German stores of Wal-Mart, which gave up its loss-making Germany business. The Wal-Mart stores were largely integrated into the Real sales brand.

In July 2008, the Extra supermarket chain with around 250 locations and sales of around 1.6 billion euro, was sold to the Rewe Group. Metro sold the Adler fashion stores to the associated company BluO in February 2009.

In October 2012, Makro-Habib in Pakistan became Metro-Habib.

In November 2012, Metro sold its 91 Real hypermarkets in Poland, Romania, Russia and Ukraine to Auchan for 1.1 billion euro. In 2014 Metro sold the 12 Real hypermarkets in Turkey. In 2017 Metro sold the last remaining four Real hypermarkets in Romania.

On 15 June 2015, Metro AG agreed to sell Galeria Kaufhof to Canadian retail conglomerate Hudson's Bay Company for $3.2 billion.

On 30 March 2016, Metro Group announced that it would be splitting into two independent companies: A spin-off of the wholesale and food sector of Metro AG will be responsible for the group divisions into two independent and publicly listed companies. Both will have their own management, supervisory board and independent company profiles. Metro AG was renamed Ceconomy, comprising Media Markt and Saturn electronics stores, while a new company with the name Metro AG was formed, comprising **Metro Cash & Carry** and Real.

In September 2018, Metro announced that it wanted to sell the Real hypermarket subsidiary in Germany to focus entirely on wholesale business. In February 2020, Real was sold to The SCP Group. The deal was completed in June 2020. With the acquisition of Johbeco AB and its subsidiary Johan i Hallen & Bergfalk, a Swedish specialist supplier of meat, fish and seafood, for around 100 million euros in May 2023, Metro entered the Swedish and Finnish market.


## Controversies

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine which began on 24 February, many international, particularly Western companies pulled out of Russia. Unlike most of its Western competitors, Metro AG announced its intention to keep its business in Russia open, drawing criticism. Ukrainian government officials have called for a global boycott of the company. The Ukrainian office of MetroAG has allegedly been threatened by the company's headquarters in Germany due to the Ukrainian branch openly calling for sanctions on Metro's Russian branch. According to Ukrainian ex-minister Dmytro Dubilet the Ukrainian branch has received warnings to be disconnected from the centralized supply. In February 2023, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption of Ukraine included the company in the list of International Sponsors of War.


### Metro on Russian market

Metro AG is Russia's fourth-biggest retailer behind X5 PJPq.L, Magnit MGNTq.L and French chain Auchan. The company entered the market in 2001 with the opening of its first wholesale store in Moscow. Over the years, Metro AG has expanded its presence in the country, opening stores in several other cities, including Saint Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don. There are 97 stores in 65 cities across the country. In 2022, the company's revenue amounted to 224 billion rubles.

On 22 March 2022, in response to the ongoing war in Ukraine, Metro AG published an official statement expressing solidarity with Ukraine and condemning the war.

Currently, Metro AG is developing the integration of new projects in Russia, such as the establishment of the grocery stores chain "Fasol" and the acceptance of payments by "Mir" cards, a project initiated by "Sberbank" in response to sanctions. Furthermore, the investigation by the National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) revealed that the key shareholder of Metro Cash & Carry, Daniel Kretynski, controls EP Infrastructure (EPIF), which owns 49% of Eustream, the company that operates a gas transportation system from Russia to Central and Eastern Europe. This fact, combined with the company's actions, led to Metro Cash & Carry being added to the NACP's list of international sponsors of war.

Metro AG's latest quarterly financial results report, which was released on 8 February 2023, indicates a decrease in sales at the chain's stores in Russia. The document states that the sales in local currency decreased by 14.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022–2023; adjusted EBITDA in Russia decreased to €60 million from €81 million in Q1 2021/2022.

Notably, Belgium was the only country where Metro had stores under both brands, and it was also unique in allowing general access to its Makro network, typically reserved for business customers. Only Metro wholesale network stores that avoided bankruptcy were subsequently sold and reopened under the Sligro-M brand.

In 2023, their operations in India were sold to Reliance Retail.
