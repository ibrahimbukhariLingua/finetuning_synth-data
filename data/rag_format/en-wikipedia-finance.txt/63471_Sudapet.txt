Sudapet


# Sudapet



The **Sudan National Petroleum Corporation**, also known as **Sudapet**, is a state-owned oil company based in Sudan. It was founded in 1997 and is 100% owned by the Ministry for Energy and Mining (later the Ministry of Petroleum and Gas).

As a NOC, Sudapet has equities varying from 5% to 70% in the licensed petroleum concessions in Sudan with other foreign shareholders, in addition to a large range of petroleum associated services subsidiaries.

From 2006 to 2015, Sudapet is not active in oil exploitation, but rather serves to manage revenues the Sudanese government receives from its concessions to foreign operators. At the same time there have been efforts within the government and among the company's principles to develop the resources and know-how to transform Sudapet into a fully self-sufficient enterprise in the oil exploitation space.


## History

Sudapet was founded in 1997, and operated in the north of Sudan, while another state company, Nilepet, operated out of southern Sudan.

In 2011, the Sudanese government raised complaints that president of south Sudan had seized shares of Sudapet amounting to $2 billion. According to Sudapet, Salva Kiir ordered the shares be transferred to Nilepet.

In response to the military overthrow of the government, in 2021, workers at Sudapet said they would join a civil disobedience movement called by trade unions.

In November 1997, the United States imposed sanctions against Sudan on the basis that profits from oil were being used to fuel the civil war. In February 2000, the US government extended its sanctions to include Sudapet and the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC). This was a contentious move in that Canadian international Talisman Energy was a 25% shareholder in GNPOC.

Later in September 2017, the United States lifted long-standing economic sanctions against Sudan.
