## History

In 2004, Andre Duka together with his partner Veronika Duka created Swiss brokerage house Dukascopy. In 2006, Dukascopy launched its ECN, the SWFX Swiss Forex Marketplace.

In August 2014, the district court of the canton of ZÃ¼rich confirmed the conviction of three investment managers who had been found guilty in 2012 for churning clients' funds using Dukascopy's platform. Although no criminal charges were brought against Dukascopy, the bank was ordered to disgorge 775,000 francs of unlawful profit.

In January 2015, Dukascopy Bank SA acquired 100% of Alpari Japan K.K., Tokyo (a distressed subsidiary of Alpari Group). At the same time, Dukascopy, together with other brokers, campaigned for deregulation of the Swiss investment market.
