Prior to Reebonz, Samuel Lim founded one of South East Asia’s largest mobile content business, Fusion Mobile, in his first year of university in 2000. In 2004, he founded another line of business under eFusion Solutions Pte Ltd called Fusion Direct. Benjamin Han and Daniel Lim had their first taste of e-commerce when Zuunbo.com was launched in 2007. Zunnbo.com was awarded seed funding by the Singapore Management University (SMU) Business Innovation Generator, which manages the Entrepreneurial Talent Development Fund together with SPRING Singapore for investing in promising business proposals.

Co-founder Samuel Lim took out notices in BT on 10 September to alert creditors that Reebonz is "in creditors' voluntary liquidation". Lim explained in the notice that Reebonz "cannot by reason of its liabilities continue its business".
