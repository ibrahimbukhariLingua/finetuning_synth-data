# B&B Hotels



**B&B HOTELS** is a French budget hotel chain that was founded in Brest in Brittany in 1990, and has since expanded in 17 European countries.


## History

The hotel chain was founded in 1990 by François Branellec of Galaxie SA. The first hotels opened simultaneously in Brest and Saint-Malo in Brittany, France. 1998 marked the opening of the first hotel in Germany. Branellec sold the chain to Duke Street Capital in 2003. The name B&B HOTELS dates back to 2006, one year after the acquisition of Galaxie SA by the investment company Eurazeo.
The B&B HOTELS Group absorbed its competitor "Village Hôtels" in 2007, then continued its development in France, Germany, Italy (2009) and Poland (2010). In 2013, the Group acquired 4 hotels in Spain and opened a new hotel in the Czech Republic. The Group opened its doors at Disneyland® Paris in 2015. 2016 marked the acquisition of the Sidorme Group with 19 hotels in Spain.
B&B HOTELS continued its international development in Brazil (2017), Switzerland, Belgium, Portugal and Slovenia (2018). Their 500th establishment opened in Palermo, Italy in 2019. In 2022, the Group inaugurated its 52nd establishment in Île-de-France and its first in the French overseas departments and territories (Martinique).

### Concept

B&B HOTELS is positioned in the budget hotel sector, competing with chains such as Ibis, Holiday Inn and Kyriad. The model includes a breakfast buffet, free Wi-Fi, remote check-in and check-out.
The chain does not own all its hotels and operates mainly on a management-agent basis.
