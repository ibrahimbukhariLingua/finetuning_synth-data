## Technology

Towerstream markets a combination of Fixed Wireless and WiMAX (802.16e) technology as "4G". Fixed wireless networks use Ethernet technology, not TDM that the legacy infrastructure relies on and have been in production since the 1970s, primarily used for backhaul in voice networks for phone companies. The network uses Radio Frequency (RF) base stations to provide Internet access. Towerstream base stations connect to multiple Tier 1 network IP backbone service providers, to ensure continuous service should any of the fiber providers go down.

Towerstream's markets operating with WiMAX technology use the 3.65 GHz spectrum band and are true Non-Line-of-Site (NLOS). Its markets using Fixed WiMAX service run over the 5.8 GHz spectrum band and are Line-of-Site (LOS).

In 2014, Towerstream launched its On-Net fixed wireless service offering building owners and property managers a redundant and reliable dense urban network that directly connects with Towerstream's fiber backbone. Towerstream On-Net building tenants have access to 100 Mbit/s of dedicated, symmetrical Internet connectivity, with a premier SLA. These On-Net buildings leverage Towerstream's fixed wireless network built high above each city. The dense, mesh architecture is highly redundant and reliable with short-distance connections to Towerstream's fiber backbone in each city. Towerstream installs the equipment required in each building to provide every business at that location with 100 Mbit/s connections.


## HetNets Tower Corporation

HetNets Tower Corporation ("HetNets") was formed in January 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Towerstream Corporation (Nasdaq:TWER), offering a neutral host, shared wireless infrastructure solution, either independently or as a turnkey service. Its wireless communications infrastructure was available to wireless carriers, cable and Internet companies in major urban markets where the explosion in mobile data is creating significant demand for additional capacity and coverage. HetNets offered a carrier-class Wi-Fi network for Internet access and the offloading of mobile data. On March 15, 2016, Towerstream announced that the company had closed HetNets Tower Corporation.
