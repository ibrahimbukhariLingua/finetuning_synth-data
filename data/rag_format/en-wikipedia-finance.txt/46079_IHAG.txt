## History

In 1949, German-born industrialist Emil Georg Bührle, formed *Industrie- und Handelsbank AG* (English: Bank of Industry and Commerce, Inc.) in Zürich, Switzerland primarily to finance his own industrial investments and expansion plans of Oerlikon-Bührle and to preserve his assets for future generations. Later, the bank added services for external clients such as asset management and lending. In 1994, the name was changed, initially to IHAG Handelsbank Zürich and then ultimately to Privatbank IHAG Zürich.
