## History

Dolmen City's site was originally the site of a casino complex, which was closed in 1978 during the dictatorship of General Zia-ul-Haq before it was formally opened. The site was purchased for 100 million rupees, but the value of the listed portion of that property was in excess of 50 billion rupees in 2019. The complex was owned by the International Complex Project - a venture which was 20% owned by the Arif Habib Group, and 80% by the Dolmen Group.
