After he left school, he interned for a summer with a New York-based developer run by the Ohebshalom family, (also of Persian Jewish heritage). He oversaw the renovation of his father's property and later took out a mortgage on the building. In 1998, he and his parents co-founded Magnum Real Estate Group.

Shaoul purchases buildings that have not been renovated for a long time and renovates them, and then increases the rent. He primarily focuses on the East Village has added luxury apartments on top existing buildings.

In 2013, Shaoul and Magnum Real Estate Group opened Bloom62, a luxury apartment building located in the East Village. Shaoul and Westbrook Partners sold a jointly-held investment portfolio of 17 properties for $130 million to Jared Kushner in February of that year.

## Personal life

Shaoul is married to Megan Walsh Shaoul. They have three children: Henry, Piper, and Mayer. He has been criticized for contributing to the decline of rent-regulated apartments in the East Village. He was labeled "Sledgehammer Shaoul" after confronting tenants in a building he purchased and being photographed with construction workers holding sledgehammers and crowbars. In 2014, he was sued by his parents for using the proceeds from the refinancing of co-owned assets to fund his development projects. The dispute was later resolved.
