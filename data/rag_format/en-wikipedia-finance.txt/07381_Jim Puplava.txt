## Career

Puplava provides financial education with his Financial Sense Newshour
podcast. He clearly seconds the views of the Austrian School of economics and sees an inflationary outcome of current fiscal and financial policies. Still his interview platform Financial Sense Newshour provides a space for guests seconding and opposing his opinion.
Puplava currently advocates investment in dividend-paying stocks. He warns about the negative effects of financial repression on future bond prices and advocates laddered bond portfolios vs. bond funds. He sees precious metals like gold or silver as an insurance protection against a possible inflationary development or even a crash of the fiat money system. His news show provides not only a platform for well-known experts seconding his opinion, but he also airs opposing views.


### Peak oil

Puplava is an expert on the theory of peak oil and its consequences for the financial landscape, and was a speaker at the ASPO conference in 2008. He has interviewed several peak oil proponents on his radio program, including Richard Heinberg, Matt Simmons, Jim Kunstler, Robert L. Hirsch and Oxford University's Oliver Inderwildi.


### TV roles and appearances

In 1991, Puplava was hired to anchor the nightly segment *Business Today* for KUSI TV. He appeared on ABC News's Nightline program on November 8, 2007, in a segment called "Sign of the Times" with John Donovan.


### Financial Sense Wealth Management

Originally Puplava Financial Services, known today as Financial Sense Wealth Management, began as an investment and money management firm. What started off as a small financial planning service in 1985 has since grown to a full team of portfolio managers and client service managers with the benefit of a broker-dealer arm to service other advisors and representatives, with financial planning at the core of what they do each day. Two of Jim's three sons work with him in a professional capacity. His oldest son, Ryan Puplava, is the CEO of Financial Sense Wealth Management and his second-oldest son, Chris Puplava, is the Chief Investment Officer of Financial Sense Wealth Management.


### Kimber Resources proxy battle

Kimber Resources is a Canadian-based company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange and is engaged in the development and exploration of mineral properties in Mexico, of which the most advanced project is the Monterde gold/silver property. Puplava was elected to Kimber's Board of Directors in May 2004. In September 2006, a press release issued by Kimber Resources reported a disagreement. Puplava, by then a director and significant shareholder, stated his intention to start a proxy battle with the objective of replacing a majority of the Board of Directors and current management.
Late October 2006, Puplava agreed to withdraw his threat for a proxy battle when the board of directors agreed to changes in the management team.
