## History

On October 20, 2010, Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce became the majority shareholder of ZAK SA by acquiring 52.6% of its shares. On October 13, 2011, the Tarnów company purchased an additional 40.86% of ZAK SA shares, bringing its total ownership to 93.48%. This was part of a broader consolidation effort in the chemical industry, following the acquisition of 66% of the shares of Zakłady Chemiczne "Police" by Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce. This consolidation was finalized with an agreement between Zakłady Azotowe in Tarnów-Mościce and Zakłady Azotowe Puławy. As a result, all companies within the Grupa Azoty underwent a rebranding, and the Kędzierzyn company was renamed Grupa Azoty Zakłady Azotowe Kędzierzyn SA, abbreviated as Grupa Azoty ZAK S.A.
