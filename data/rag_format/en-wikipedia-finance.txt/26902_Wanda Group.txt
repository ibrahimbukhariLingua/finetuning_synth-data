## History

The company was founded in Dalian, Liaoning, in 1988 as a residential real estate company by Chinese businessman and investor Wang Jianlin. Incorporated in 1992, the company was "one of the first shareholding companies in the People's Republic of China" after the economic reform. The company started to use the name "Wanda" since then. "Wàn" (Chinese: 万) means ten thousand, and "Dá" (Chinese: 达) means to reach or attain. In combination, the company's name is a slogan aspiring to be able to reach everything.


### Diversification push

Since 2005, Dalian Wanda and other prominent Chinese real estate companies such as Evergrande have made numerous forays into "alternative, income-generating businesses away from the income-producing Chinese property market." The *Financial Times* noted that Dalian Wanda was the "most aggressive" company in pursuing this strategy, pointing to its 2012 acquisition of American cinema chain AMC Theatres and 2013 purchase of British yachtmaker Sunseeker. It noted that it was also "building theme parks across China, and has a joint venture with Tencent and Baidu to set up an e-commerce platform".

Dalian Wanda acquired the American cinema operator AMC Theatres in May 2012 for US$2.6 billion, the largest Chinese acquisition of an American company to that date. The acquisition went through successfully in August 2012, making Wanda Cinemas the world's largest cinema operator. As of 2016, Wanda owned approximately 6% of all commercial movie screens in China, and about 13% in the U.S. The company made major changes in AMC theater design and layout, including generously sized reclining seats, waiter service, and expanded food and drink offerings. AMC's value more than doubled in the 18 months following the acquisition, and by the end of 2014 Wanda reaped a reported profit of about US$900 million. It no longer has control as of 2021.

In June 2013, Dalian Wanda planned to invest $1.1 billion to develop a new five-star hotel in London next to the Thames River in Vauxhall, South London, as part of the Nine Elms regeneration.
