## Controversy


### Sugar plantation

In 2014, it was revealed that the ANZ Royal Bank had been financing a sugar plantation, Phnom Penh Sugar, which had been connected to child labour and forced evictions. The bank responded by saying that they would "continue to engage with this particular case" and would "review the way the company addresses its social and environmental obligations". Though the bank later stopped funding the plantation, farmers handed the bank a petition in August 2014 asking them to take responsibility and help repair the damage done by the plantation. Despite the petition and further protests, the bank declined to help the communities affected.
