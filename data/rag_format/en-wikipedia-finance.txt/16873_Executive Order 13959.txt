# Executive Order 13959



**Executive Order 13959** is a U.S. Presidential Executive Order signed on November 12, 2020, by President Donald Trump. Its title, and stated goal, is "Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies."

A related Executive Order 14032 ("Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Certain Companies of the People's Republic of China") was signed by President Joe Biden on June 3, 2021. The national emergency declared by E.O. 13959 remains in effect and has been expanded by E.O. 14032.


## Prohibiting investment in "Communist Chinese military companies"

The executive order prohibits all U.S. investors (institutional and retail investors alike) from purchasing or investing in securities of companies identified by the U.S. government as "Communist Chinese military companies". A "Communist Chinese military company" is any company that the U.S. Department of Defense has identified pursuant to Section 1237 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. The prohibition came into effect on January 11, 2021. On December 28, 2020, guidance on the executive order was published clarifying that the order included subsidiaries of the relevant companies. On January 13, 2021, President Trump strengthened the executive order's requirements by issuing Executive Order 13974 ("Amending Executive Order 13959â€”Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies"), which mandated divestment by November 11, 2021.
