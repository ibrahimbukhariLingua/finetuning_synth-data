## History

Headquartered in San Francisco, Demandbase was founded in 2007 by then CEO Chris Golec. Golec was replaced as CEO by the company's Chief Revenue Officer Gabe Rogol in 2019, and left his full-time with the company in 2021 (he still serves as a board member).

The company released Demandbase Central in August 2008. Demandbase Professional followed in February 2009.

Demandbase bought data provider WhoToo in 2015. This helped the company extend its targeting capabilities. In June 2016, Spiderbook, a data science startup, was acquired.

In 2020 and 2021, Demandbase broadened its offering through significant acquisitions. In June 2020, the company announced the acquisition of another ABM solution, *Engagio,* which added the capability of nurturing accounts based on first-party data to Demandbase's ability to identify and target accounts through third-party data. Jon Miller, co-founder of Engagio, and previously of *Marketo* became Chief Marketing Officer at Demandbase.

In November 2020, Demandbase released Demandbase One, a new version of its platform, built by integrating Demandbase Classic and Engagio.

In May 2021, the company announced the acquisitions of B2B data and sales intelligence platform *InsideView* and technographics vendor *DemandMatrix.* This allowed the Demandbase suite, going forward, to incorporate a Sales Intelligence Cloud and a Data Cloud to complement its existing ABX (Account Based Experience) Cloud and Advertising Cloud.
