# SindoPower



**SindoPower** is the first business-to-business (B2B) eCommerce business owned by a manufacturer of power semiconductor components. Other manufacturers rely on representatives or independent distributors.

SindoPower's parent company, The German-based holding company Semikron, employs 3,600 people worldwide. SEMIKRON comprises a global network of 35 companies with 10 production sites. Power electronics are produced in Germany, France, Italy, Slovakia, South Africa, Brazil, USA, China, India and South Korea. The company has a 37% share of the worldwide market for diode/thyristor modules.

SindoPower was integrated into the Semikron Group in 2015.


## Products

SindoPower’s product range consists of approximately 2,000 of overall 11,600 different power semiconductors from 1 kW to 10 MW, including chips, discrete diodes/thyristors, fuses, sensors, varistors, connectors, and power modules (IGBT, MOSFET, diode, thyristor) as an official distributor of Epcos, LEM, Mersen, SEMIKRON and Weidmüller.

* public transparency in pricing
* Web 2.0 community approach for power electronics experts
* real-time customer service
* stock visibility and automatic substitute proposal for out of stock componentsᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
