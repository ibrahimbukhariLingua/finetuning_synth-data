# Senegal Airlines



**Groupe Air Sénégal**, operating as **Senegal Airlines** (French: *Sénégal Compagnies Aériennes*), was an airline with its head office on the property of Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport in Dakar, Senegal. It operated a scheduled network in Senegal and neighbouring countries from its main base at Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport.


## History

The airline was launched after Air Sénégal International ceased its operations in 2009, and made its first flights on 25 January 2011. Senegal Airlines's CEO was Edgardo Badiali, the former CEO of GoAir and MyAir. It was 64% privately owned.

On 12 April 2016, Senegal's Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning, Amadou Ba, announced that Senegal Airlines had formally ceased all operations. Senegal Airlines was shut down because it had accumulated over 100 billion CFA francs ($172 million US dollars) of debt since its inception.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Senegal plans to establish a new flag carrier in the near future.
