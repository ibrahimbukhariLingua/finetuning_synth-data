Public Accounts Committee (Pakistan)


# Public Accounts Committee (Pakistan)



The **Public Accounts Committee** (**PAC**) holds a significant role within global accountability frameworks, working to ensure the responsible use of public funds. Operating as a legislative body within the National Assembly of Pakistan, its primary objective is to uphold transparency and accountability across all public bodies and constitutional institutions. Through its functions, the PAC aims to present a clear and accountable representation of these entities, promoting financial integrity and good governance.


## History

The inaugural Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in Pakistan was established on 20 May 1948. Since its formation, there have been a total of 14 regular PACs and 6 Ad hoc PACs. Ad hoc PACs are constituted in Pakistan during periods when there is no elected Legislature in the country, ensuring oversight and accountability even in transitional or exceptional circumstances.


## Role

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) plays a crucial role in upholding transparency and accountability within Ministries, Divisions, and Public Sector Organizations in Pakistan. Its responsibilities include a thorough examination of the Auditor General of Pakistan's Report. This involves summoning representatives from the relevant Ministries and Departments to probe and inquire about any financial irregularities.

The PAC meticulously reviews public audits, inviting ministers, permanent secretaries, or other officials from the ministries for questioning. After conducting a government budget audit, the PAC compiles a report detailing their findings. Subsequently, the government is obligated to report back to parliament on the recommendations provided by the PAC within a specified period, ensuring appropriate action is taken based on the committee's findings.
