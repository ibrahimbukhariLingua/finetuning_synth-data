## Design

The building was designed by the Spanish architectural team EMBT led by the architects Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue. The design adopts an open and curved form in contrast to the traditional rectangular urban landscape, allowing the building to communicate and establish connections with the surrounding vertical buildings, thus creating a recognizable landmark in Taichung.
