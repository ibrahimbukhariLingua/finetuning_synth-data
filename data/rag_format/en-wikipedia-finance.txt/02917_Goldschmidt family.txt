Goldschmidt family


# Goldschmidt family



The **Goldschmidt family** is a family of German Jewish descent, originally from Frankfurt am Main, known for their success in banking and finance.

With origins tracing back to the 15th century, most members were forced to leave Frankfurt after the 1614 Fettmilch uprising, and did not return until the 18th century.

The family was interwoven particularly with the Rothschild family, the Bischoffsheim family of Mainz, and with the Bartolome Family, one of the richest families of Monaco. The Bischoffsheim and Goldschmidt families conjointly managed the Bischoffsheim, Goldschmidt & Cie Bank, which was eventually merged into Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas in 1863, the forerunner to BNP Paribas.

On 6 September 1903, Maximilian Goldschmidt was elevated to the title of Baron von **Goldschmidt-Rothschild** in Prussia, by Emperor Wilhelm II. Thus, the family became part of the German nobility.
