Essequibo Society


# Essequibo Society



The ***Essequibo Society***, in Dutch: *Sociëteit van Essequibo,* (SVE), full name in 18th century Dutch *Societeyt ter Navigatie op Essequebo en annexe Rivieren,* was a Dutch trading company headquartered in Middelburg, founded in 1771 and disestablished in 1788. The society was founded to preserve Zeeland´s preferential trading rights to Essequibo. It went bankrupt as a consequence of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War.


## History


### Foundation

The right to trade on Essequibo River and Demerara River had been reserved for residents of Zeeland since 1670, a privilege that was exploited mainly by the Zeeland Chamber of the Dutch West India Company. As the trade grew in significance, the Zeeland monopoly was questionned. In reaction, in 1754 merchants from Zeeland developed a project for the establishment of an Essequibo Society. The project did not materialize at the time.

In 1771, Willem V finally promoted a regulation that opened up the market for merchants of Amsterdam. Zeeland retained the right to equip the first 16 ships per year. All ships had to sail from Zeeland and unload their return cargo there.

In response to the changed regulations, merchants from Middelburg led by Kornelis van der Helm Boddaert founded the *Essequibo Society* in 1771. 185 merchants subscribed for an amount of 320,000 guilders. Other participants were Johan Adriaan van de Perre de Nieuwerve, representing Willem V; the MCC, the roperies *Fortuyn* and *Swarte Kabel* and the Middelburg city government.

In the first two years, six ships were purchased: *Phoenix*, *Planterslust*, *Vreede*, *Eensgezindheid*, *Middelburgs Hoop* and *Westhove*. In addition, the frigate *Essquebo Societeit* was built and launched from the Middelburg slipway in 1772.


### Operation and bankruptcy

Merchants from Zeeland accounted for 152 voyages between 1771 and 1789. The first two financial years, *Essequebo Society* paid 3% dividend and retained 4,500 guilders in cash. After that year, losses were reported until 1778. After 1779 profits were again made. After the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War broke out, four ships were captured by the British: *Eensgezindheid,* *Jonge Juffrouw Margaretha,* *Middelburgsche Hoop* and *Vryheid*. The financial situation of the society deteriorated. In 1788 it was decided to liquidate. The debt was paid off by selling ships, so that the organization continued to exist for some time.
