## Controversies

Mojmír Hampl has been a supporter of helicopter money, which he calls "direct support of consumption." He argues that, in a deep recession accompanied by deflation, central banks should create new money and send them to households via central bank digital currency. According to Hampl, such a policy would circumvent the complicated monetary transmission mechanism inherent in the use of quantitative easing and support aggregate demand directly. His proposals were endorsed by, for example, Eric Lonergan. However, critics claim that helicopter money drops could lead to a sharp increase in inflation rates. Mojmír Hampl is also opposed to euro adoption in the Czech Republic and gave a speech in the European Parliament on the potential break-up of the euro area. In his speeches he frequently questions a potential of cryptocurrencies to become a full-fledged alternative to conventional money and defends a traditional elastic money system. He has also been a fervent opponent of the introduction of the European Union financial transaction tax.

In 2010 he had a public dispute with the IMF caused by his claim in the Austrian newspaper Der Standard that the IMF by its communication effectively worsened the impacts of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on Central and Eastern Europe. The IMF denied this claim.
