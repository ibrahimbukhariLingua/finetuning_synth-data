The **Second Adrian Hasler cabinet** was the governing body of Liechtenstein from 30 March 2017 to 25 March 2021. It was appointed by Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein and was chaired by Adrian Hasler.


## History

The 2017 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a win for the Progressive Citizens' Party. As a result, the First Adrian Hasler cabinet was dissolved with Adrian Hasler continuing as Prime Minister of Liechtenstein. The Progressive Citizens' Party and Patriotic Union once again entered into a coalition government.

In 2019, Aurelia Frick, minister of foreign affairs, was subject to an embezzlement scandal where she was accused of misappropriating funds as a part of her duties and not being declaring enough with the Landtag of Liechtenstein's audit commission. In response, Hasler called for Frick to make an apology and to cooperate with the audit commission regarding the investigation. However, she refused to cooperate with the audit commission, and on 2 July 2019 the Landtag passed a motion of no confidence against her, and she was expelled from her position. She was succeeded by Katrin Eggenberger.

Near the end of the government's term, the cabinet was faced with the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic in Liechtenstein. Due to school closures as a result of the pandemic, the cabinet pioneered the transformation of Liechtenstein's education to a digital platform, particularly by that of Dominique Hasler, responsible for the ministry of education.

On 27 May 2020, Adrian Hasler announced that he would not run for re-election. The 2021 Liechtenstein general election resulted in a win for the Patriotic Union. As a result, the cabinet was dissolved and Hasler was succeeded by Daniel Risch in the Daniel Risch cabinet.
