She submitted her resignation from the board on February 9, 2007, and left the Fed effective March 30, 2007. A Federal Reserve Press Notice stated she planned to spend more time with her family.


## Prior professional career

Before becoming a member of the board, Bies was executive vice president for risk management and auditor at First Tennessee National Corporation (now listed as First Horizon National Corporation) in Memphis, Tennessee (1995–2001). From 1979 to 1995, she served in various other positions at First Tennessee, including executive vice president and chief financial officer, senior vice president and chief financial officer, senior vice president and treasurer, vice president for corporate development, tactical planning manager, and economist.

Before joining First Tennessee, Bies was associate professor of economics, Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee (1977–79); assistant professor of economics, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan (1972–77); and chief regional and banking structure economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (1970–72).

## Comment on subprime mortgage crisis

In December 2008, Bies said she thought that regulators had been caught by surprise by the rapid growth in volume of so-called subprime and adjustable-rate mortgages in the mid-2000s subprime mortgage crisis, and that she regretted there was not quicker action taken to protect borrowers. "When you get into people whose mortgage payments are taking half of their cash flow, they are in over their heads, and these loans should not have been sold to this customer base," she said, quoted in *The New York Times*. "This makes me sick when I see this happening."


## Joins Bank of America board

In June 2009, as part of a government-encouraged restructuring of the board after the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Bies was named to the board of directors of Bank of America.


## Personal life

As of 2007, Bies is married and has two adult sons.
