Global Maritime Forum


# Global Maritime Forum



The **Global Maritime Forum** is an international not-for-profit organisation for the global maritime industry. It convenes leaders from across the maritime community with policy-makers, experts, NGOs and other influential decision-makers.


## Initiatives

The **Getting to Zero Coalition** is a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum and the World Economic Forum. Launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in New York in 2019, the Getting to Zero Coalition is a platform that convenes around 200 stakeholders from across the shipping and fuels value chain. The goal of the Getting to Zero Coalition is to have commercially viable Zero Emission Vessels operating along deep sea trade routes by 2030, supported by the necessary infrastructure for scalable zero-carbon energy sources including production, distribution, storage and bunkering. The ultimate ambition of the Getting to Zero Coalition is to reach the full decarbonization of global shipping by 2050; in 2021, Call to Action initiative was developed with more than 150 industry leaders and organizations urging governments and global shipping industry to commit to full decarbonization of international shipping by 2050.
