Research Institute of the Finnish Economy


# Research Institute of the Finnish Economy



**ETLA Economic Research** (Finnish: Elinkeinoelämän tutkimuslaitos, Swedish: Näringslivets forskningsinstitut), commonly known by its Finnish acronym ETLA or Etla, is a private, non-profit research institute based in Helsinki, Finland. It conducts independent, applied economic research into key issues affecting Finnish business and the national economy


## History

Etla was founded on August 1, 1946, when it was called the Economic Research Centre. Rapid postwar political and economic changes created a need for basic economic information throughout Finland. Soon its focus moved to long-term research studies, particularly economic growth and productivity. By the 1970s, Etla was producing regular economic forecasts. Today, Etla continues to maintain a steady output of reliable independent research on the Finnish economy.

Other Finnish research organisations in the same field, such as VATT Institute for Economic Research, Pellervo Economic Research PTT, and the Labour Institute for Economic Research LABORE sometimes collaborate with Etla on various research projects. It also cooperates extensively with international research bodies, including universities, business colleges and other research institutes.

Etla shares its CEO, Board of Directors and financial administration with the Finnish Business and Policy Forum EVA . They also occupy the same premises.


## Research activities

Etla follows two main themes: the impact of Finnish economic policy and the impact of megatrends emerging in around the world. These are addressed under four research areas:

* Labour market and education
* Growth, international trade and competition
* Macroeconomy and public finances
* Business renewal

Etlatieto Ltd is an Etla subsidiary that conducts externally-financed project research. Its core competence is business and industrial economics, with a particular interest in the global economy.
