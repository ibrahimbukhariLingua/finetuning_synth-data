List of corporate titles


# List of corporate titles



Corporate titles or business titles are given to company and organization officials to show what job function, and seniority, a person has within an organisation. The most senior roles, marked by signing authority, are often referred to as "C-level", "C-suite" or "CxO" positions because many of them start with the word "chief". Many positions at this level report to a president or chief executive officer, or to a company's board of directors. People in senior executive positions of publicly traded companies are often offered stock options so it is in their interest that the company's stock price increases over time, in parallel with being accountable to investors.
