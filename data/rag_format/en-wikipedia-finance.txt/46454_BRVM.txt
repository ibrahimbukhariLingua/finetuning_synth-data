## Mission

The mission of the BRVM is to:

* organize the securities market;
* disseminate market information;
* promote the market.

## History

**Time line**
Market integration by the BRVM is a political, institutional, and technical success. The Bourse Régionale and **Dépositaire Central**/**Banque de Règlement** (**DC/BR**) were established in several phases:

* November 14, 1973: Treaty signed establishing the West African Monetary Union (WAMU), which created a financial market organized into sub-regions.
* December 17, 1993: WAMU Council of Ministers decides to create a Regional Financial Market and mandates the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to conduct the project.
* December 18, 1996: Various preliminary activities are conducted resulting in the formation in Cotonou of Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières S.A. (BRVM) and Dépositaire Central/Banque de Règlement S.A. (DC/BR), thus marking the end of the BCEAO mandate and the takeover of project management by its own agencies.
* November 20, 1997: Union's Council of Ministers establishes the Regional Council for Public Saving and Financial Markets.
* September 16, 1998: BRVM and DC/BR begin operations.

## Operations

The BRVM is entirely electronic. The central site in Abidjan provides securities quotation and trading services as well as regulation/issuing services.

Agents sitting at workstations in their offices or desks located in national branch offices in WAEMU countries and brokerage firms can:

* enter orders for securities and send them to the central site via the satellite network;
* consult and edit quotation results;
* consult statistical information on the BRVM and Dépositaire Central;
* distribute information.

The principles followed in establishing the BRVM satisfy the requirement for both compliance with international standards and adaptability to the WAEMU socioeconomic environment. Equal access to information and the management of investors and network access costs, regardless of the economic operator's location, are key drivers. The exchange can be described as follows:

A centralized exchange driven by orders, that is, the price of a security is fixed by matching bid and ask orders collected before the quotation.

Three weekly trading sessions with two fixings (single price obtained by matching bid with ask orders). These sessions will evolve rapidly towards daily sessions to implement:

* real-time quotation sessions;
* a spot market with a sliding transaction closing date so operators know exactly when they will have to meet their commitments. At the start, the BRVM closed transactions on D+5 (trading day plus five business days) but this must move towards current international standards, that is, closing on D+3;
* guaranteed transactions, thanks to the establishment of a market guarantee fund supported by brokerage firms to mitigate an eventual default;
* holding and centralization of securities by a central clearing house and their exclusive circulation in a dematerialized form.

Formulation and selection criteria for the BRVM Composite and BRVM 10 are based on the leading global market indexes, especially the FCG index of the International Finance Corporation; a World Bank affiliate. The formula for the indexes takes into account market capitalization, transaction volume per session and transaction frequency. Only common shares are used to calculate the indexes.

The concept of liquidity also plays a key role in selecting securities for the BRVM 10. For each one, the average daily transaction volume in the three months preceding the quarterly review must not be less than the median daily transaction volume for all securities. Transaction frequency must always be higher than 50%, and the security must be traded at least one out of two times during the three-month study period.

The indexes are automatically generated by the BRVM trading system and circulated after every trading session. The BRVM 10 is also reviewed four times a year (first Monday of January, April, July and October ), and the BRVM Composite after every new listing so it can keep pace with the growth of the Regional Financial Exchange.
