# Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority



The **General Authority of Zakat, Tax, and Customs (ZATCA)** (Arabic: هيئة الزكاة والضريبة والجمارك) is a government agency under the Ministry of Finance in Saudi Arabia that is responsible for the assessment and collection of taxes and *zakat*, a form of obligatory almsgiving in Islam. ZATCA was established on 14 June 1951 as department under the Ministry of Finance.

ZATCA is headquartered in Riyadh and consists of the Taxpayer Department and 19 branches distributed over the main cities in the country.


## Fatoora Platform

The Fatoora Platform is an electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) system developed by ZATCA to streamline the invoicing process and enhance compliance with tax regulations in Saudi Arabia. Launched on 24 August 2021, the platform facilitates the digital issuance and management of invoices across all sectors, significantly reducing the administrative burden and improving transparency. It requires integration with taxpayers' existing ERP/POS systems to generate, track, and manage e-invoices. The Fatoora platform is part of Saudi Arabia's broader Saudi Vision 2030 initiatives aiming to digitize economic and governmental infrastructures.
