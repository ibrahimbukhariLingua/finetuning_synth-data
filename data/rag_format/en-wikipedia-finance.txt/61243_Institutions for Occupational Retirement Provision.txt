## Revision

On 27 March 2014, the Commission released a proposed text for revising the Directive, and to recast it consolidating the other pension related Directives. In addition to the existing general provisions that would form Title I, a new IORP Directive would include new titles covering (II) quantitative requirements on where money is invested, (III) minimum standards on retirement fund governance and investment outsourcing, (IV) minimum information rights for retirement fund members, and (V) standards for prudential supervision by member state authorities.
