## History

The bank was founded on August 6, 1851, by a group of shipmasters, businessmen, and entrepreneurs. The first bank president was co-founder Henry L. Champlin, a shipmaster who owned the Black X Line of packet ships. The bank's branch served as a gathering place for many skippers who met there between voyages to discuss their adventures. The ship featured in the bank's logo is an homage to its maritime origins.

In 1999, Essex Savings added a trust department. It was rebranded to Essex Trust in 2017.

In 2015, John W. Rafal, the founder of the financial services division, was fired after he paid a referral fee in violation of regulations.
