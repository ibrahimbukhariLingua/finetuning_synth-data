Michigan Israel Business Accelerator


# Michigan Israel Business Accelerator



The **Michigan Israel Business Accelerator**, or **MIBA**, is an independent nonprofit organization that promotes economic ties between the U.S. state of Michigan and the State of Israel. The Michigan Israel Business Bridge was founded in 2007 and based in West Bloomfield, Michigan. In 2017, the Bridge was transformed and renamed the Michigan Israel Business Accelerator (MIBA). The MIBA serves as the state of Michigan's lead for all international trade between Michigan and Israel in order to drive economic prosperity and job creation in Michigan.


## Mission

Accelerating Michigan's economic growth, one Israeli innovation at a time


## Background

The Michigan Israel Business Accelerator (MIBA) facilitates high-quality, curated connections between Israeli companies and Michigan businesses, enabling access to cutting-edge innovations and growth opportunities that drive meaningful collaboration, innovation, and economic growth in both regions. With a strategic focus on five shared industry strengths—mobility, defense, health tech, sustainability tech, and food-ag tech—MIBA facilitates meaningful business-to-business connections through trade missions, industry events, and curated introductions. Central to this effort is *The Elevator*, the first U.S. landing zone exclusively for Israeli companies and startups, offering a soft landing, tailored resources, and an expanded platform for collaboration and success.

MIBA has facilitated hundreds of connections between Michigan and Israeli businesses, resulting in over 90 collaborations and more than $20 million in direct economic activity for Michigan from 2021 to 2024.

Launched in June 2023, *The Elevator* strengthens MIBA’s attraction strategy. In addition to providing no-cost office space and essential landing zone amenities for Israeli startups and businesses, it expands programming to include educational and networking opportunities designed to support their success in Michigan.
