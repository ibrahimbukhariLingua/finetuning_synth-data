### Locations (administration, sales, production)

Braas Monier is represented in the following countries in Europe, Africa and Asia:


## Technical Centre

Braas Monier operates a so-called Technical Centre for research and development with locations in Heusenstamm near Frankfurt/Main, Germany, and in Crawley in the South of London, UK, where new and existing products are being developed and tested. Here, geologists, material scientists, chemists, physicists, product designers and engineers work together in interdisciplinary teams. Products are subject to tests for handling, wind load, fire behaviour, weather resistance and ventilation. Thousands of product samples are placed for regular review in the company's own weathering stations in eight countries all over the world in order to simulate their behaviour under different climates.


### Wind tunnel

A wind tunnel, located at the Technical Centre in Heusenstamm, is able to simulate extreme weather conditions which typically arise only every 50 years. Fans, sprinkling nozzles and a hydraulic system for changing the roof pitch help to test the products in four weather scenarios. Tests will be run until water leaks from the bottom of the roof and thus the maximum load has been determined. Products which have been tested successfully are – for instance by Braas Germany – being issued with a 30-year-guarantee for the material and an additional 30-year-guarantee for frost resistance.


### Collaboration in external committees, associations and organisations

Employees of Braas Monier's Technical Centre are actively involved in the following committees, associations and organisations which – among others – work on the development of industry standards: European Cool Roofs Council, National Federation of Roofing Contractors, Building Research Establishment, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), IFD International Federation for the Roofing Trade, European Committee for Standardization (CEN), British Standards, Cool Roof Rating Council, Deutsches Institut für Normung, National House Building Council, Construction Products Association, lifeHEROTILE.

## History


### Foundation

The company was founded in the UK as the "Redhill Tile Company", in 1919, with production of its first concrete roof tiles started November of this year. In 1946, the company changed its name and became "Redland Tiles". After an expansion period between 1949 and 1951 in which Redland invested in South Africa, Australia and Malaysia, the company bought the majority of Braas in Germany. Braas’ founder, de:Rudolf Braas, had already had closed contacts with his British colleagues for some time. Still in the same year, the company's parent plant was built in Heusenstamm near Frankfurt/Main, Germany.


### "Frankfurter Pfanne"

From its market entry in 1954 until now, the "Frankfurter Pfanne" (English: Double Roman) has been the most laid concrete tile model in Germany. The main ingredients of a concrete roof tile are sand, concrete, water and colour pigments on an iron oxide basis. From the beginning, Braas gave a 30-year-guarantee on the materials of the "Frankfurter Pfanne" and was thus the first manufacturer in Germany to give long-term guarantees on building materials. In 1958, four years after market entry, the word and figurative mark "Frankfurter Pfanne" was registered with the patent office.

Today there are six models of the "Frankfurter Pfanne" in 13 different colours and two surfaces. Today Braas Monier is selling the "Frankfurter Pfanne" all over the world.


### Growth and acquisitions

In the early 1950s Braas Monier expanded into non-European markets for the first time by going into South Africa, Australia and Malaysia. Further expansion to Southeast Asia and Austria followed in the late 1960s and to other European countries at the beginning of the 1970s. The market entries into Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and the USA between 1973 and 1979 marked one of the strongest expansion periods of the company. From 1993 the Group entered further markets like Scandinavia, the Baltic States, Poland and Russia. In 2001, the worldwide production network could be expanded to over 200 plants.

Two of the major acquisitions were Schiedel (1991) and Klöber. Since 2011 Braas Monier holds 100% of the Austrian company Bramac. In January 2015, the Group announced the acquisition of roof tile manufacturers Tejas Cobert (Spain) and CT Cobert Telhas (Portugal). In 2015 and 2016 Braas Monier took over the leading manufacturer of clay roof tiles in Malaysia, Golden Clay Industries (GCI), the Italian clay roof tile manufacturer Ceprano Coperture S.r.l. and the Danish manufacturer of roof accessories J.A. Plastindustri S/A.
