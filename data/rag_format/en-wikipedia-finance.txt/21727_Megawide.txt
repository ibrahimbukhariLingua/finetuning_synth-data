## History

Megawide was established in 1997 as a mid-sized construction firm by engineers Edgar Saavedra and Michael Cosiquien a year after their graduation from De La Salle University. The company incorporated in 2004 to engage in general construction which involves site development, earthworks, structural and civil works, masonry works, architectural finishes, electrical works, plumbing and sanitary works, fire protection works and mechanical works.

In 2007, Megawide received its Triple A License from Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB). It also won two of that year’s largest construction contracts, The Berkeley Residences and Grass Tower 1 of SM Development Corporation.

Megawide Construction Corporation went public on February 18, 2011 with an initial public offering price of P7.84 per share. It was the first company to go public in 2011 and is traded under the stock symbol MWIDE. The IPO ran from February 7 to 11 and was able to raise nearly P2.3 billion in fresh funds for the company. The IPO was part of Megawide’s strategy to diversify its client base and undertake public-private partnership projects with the Philippine Government, using the funds for the construction of its precast concrete plant in Taytay, Rizal.

On March 1, 2018, Megawide Construction Corporation and its India-based consortium partner GMR Infrastructure, the consortium which revamped Mactan–Cebu International Airport, have submitted a ₱150 billion, or US$3 billion, proposal to decongest and redevelop Ninoy Aquino International Airport.
