# Marc Rowan



**Marc Jeffrey Rowan** (born August 19, 1962) is an American investor and philanthropist. He has served as the chief executive officer (CEO) of Apollo Global Management since 2021. He co-founded the firm in 1990 with Josh Harris and Leon Black. As of November 2024ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, *Forbes* estimated his net worth at $8.8 billion.


## Early life and education

Rowan was born in 1962 to a Jewish family. He was raised on Long Island, New York. He moved with his family to Hollywood, Florida where he attended high school, traveling between New York. His father worked in auto-leasing. His mother Barbara was a teacher and a trained concert pianist. He has one sister, Andrea. His grandfather, Emanuel Stein, was an economics professor at New York University. Many of his wider family worked as public interest lawyers.

Rowan studied at the University of Pennsylvania. When his father passed away and the family could not afford to pay tuition, the university allowed Rowan to complete his studies and pay whenever he was able. Rowan graduated *summa cum laude* with a B.S. and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was first in his university class, graduating as valedictorian.


## Career

Rowan joined the mergers and acquisitions department of Drexel Burnham Lambert where he worked in New York City and Los Angeles. The firm collapsed in 1990. In 1990, Rowan co-founded the asset management firm Apollo Global Management with former Drexel colleagues Leon Black and Josh Harris.

In July 2020 Rowan took a "semi-sabbatical" from Apollo, but remained involved in strategy and on boards, until taking over as CEO in March 2021. He intended to focus in areas including strategy and culture.


## Philanthropy

Rowan is Chair of the Board of UJA-Federation of New York. He is a founding member and Chair of the Youth Renewal Fund and is Vice Chair of Darca Schools.


### University of Pennsylvania

Rowan has had various involvements with the University of Pennsylvania since his graduation. He is Chair of the Board of Advisors of the Wharton School of Business. In October 2018, he donated $50 million to the Wharton School, to fund leading academics and with a focus on the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In December 2023, Rowan led a campaign among University of Pennsylvania donors to have University of Pennsylvania then-President Liz Magill and the then-Board of Trustees Scott Bok fired over what he saw as the university's insufficient response to antisemitism after the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel.

As a result of the 2023 Palestine Writes conference held at University of Pennsylvania, Rowan attempted to organize a boycott of donors and signed a letter urging a response to alleged antisemitism at the festival. Rowan advocated for the resignation of Liz Magill, due to reactions from the 2023 United States Congress hearing on antisemitism. After the resignation, Rowan penned a letter suggesting various campus reforms. Some professors at the university called the suggested reforms "a hostile Republican takeover," that would negatively affect intellectual freedom on campus.


## Politics

In December 2023, Rowan hosted a fundraiser for Republican politician and House Education Committee Chair Virginia Foxx. Together with his spouse, Rowan contributed $1 million to Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign.


### U.S. Treasury secretary nomination

In November 2024, following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Rowan was interviewed for the U.S. Treasury Secretary nomination by President Trump. Shares of Apollo fell on the announcement, according to *Barrons*, as Rowan owns 6% of outstanding Apollo stock and could be required to divest if nominated and confirmed.


## Personal life

Rowan is married to fashion designer Carolyn Pleva who he met on a blind date. They live in New York City and have four children. Rowan is a restaurateur who owns multiple eateries in The Hamptons.
