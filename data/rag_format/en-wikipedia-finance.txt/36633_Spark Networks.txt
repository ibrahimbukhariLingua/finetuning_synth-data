## History

The company was founded by Joe Y. Shapira in 1997 under the name MatchNet plc.

Jdate.com, founded in 1997, was the company's first venture into online dating. The company was also home to Christian Mingle, which was launched in 2001.

The company went public on June 27, 2000, on Germany's Neuer Markt.

In January 2005, the company changed its name to Spark Networks because management felt that the new name more sharply distinguished the company in the marketplace.

On March 10th, 2005 Spark Networks, PLC filed an S-1 registration statement and went public on the Amex Exchange

Jdate's redesign went live on November 18, 2015, while Christian Mingle's went live on December 17, 2015.

On November 2, 2017, Spark Networks SE (NYSE American: LOV) announced the completion of the previously announced merger of Spark Networks, Inc. and Affinitas GmbH in a stock-for-stock transaction.

On October 3, 2018, Spark was fined $500,000 and ordered to pay $985,000 in restitution in response to complaints that the site was automatically renewing customer accounts without their express consent. The company was sued by the Santa Monica city attorney as well as district attorneys in four counties.

On March 21, 2019, Spark entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Zoosk, Inc. The deal was finalized on July 1, 2019, forming North America's second-largest dating company in revenues and increasing Spark's global monthly paying subscribers increase to over 1 million.

As a result, MGG Investment Group is now the sole owner of Spark Networks.
