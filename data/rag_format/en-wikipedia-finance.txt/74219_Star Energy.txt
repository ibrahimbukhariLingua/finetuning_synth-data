**Star Energy** was a British onshore oil exploration company until acquired by IGas Energy in December 2011


## History

It was formed in October 1999 essentially as a management buyout of operations in the Weald Basin, acquired from Soco International. The buyout was funded by European Acquisition Capital.

In June 2000, it expanded when it acquired the assets of Roc Oil in the East Midlands Oil Province.

In May 2004 it became a public company, listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). In August 2005, it bought Pentex Oil, and increased its portfolio greatly in the East Midlands. These fields are based near Welton, Lincolnshire at Reepham, near its railway station.

In November 2005 it opened its first gas storage facility at the depleted Humbly Grove oil field, near Lasham in Hampshire. On 7 March 2008, it de-listed from the AIM stock market, becoming subsidiary of Petronas.

In December 2011 all assets, with the exception of Humbly Grove were acquired by IGas .
