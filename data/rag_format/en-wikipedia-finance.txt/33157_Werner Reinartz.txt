# Werner Reinartz



**Werner Josef Reinartz** (born in 1963 in Langerwehe, Germany) is a German economist. Since 2007 he is a Professor of Retailing and Customer Management at the University of Cologne and the Director of the Center for Research in Retailing (IFH).


## Life and education

Reinartz studied Agricultural Sciences at the Technical University of Munich and graduated in 1990 with a degree in Agricultural Engineering (Dipl.Ing. agr.). After completing his studies, he worked in international sales and marketing at Lorenz von Ehren in Hamburg, Germany. In 1994, he enrolled at Henley Management College, England, and graduated with a master's degree in Business Administration. His doctoral studies focusing on marketing took place from 1995 to 1999 at the University of Houston in the United States. His dissertation was one of the first academic research studies that dealt comprehensively and empirically with the topic 'Customer Lifetime Value'. While the previous belief in much of management writing was that customer loyalty is unanimously beneficial, he was the first to show that the correlation of customer loyalty and customer lifetime value is in many cases marginal. Importantly, this means that, rather than focusing on loyalty management, managers have to understand the measurement and management of customer lifetime value instead.

Before leaving, he held the Cora Chaired Professor of Management and Retailing.
