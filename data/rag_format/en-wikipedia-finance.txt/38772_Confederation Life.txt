## History


### Foundation and growth

The company was founded in 1871 by John Kay Macdonald (1837–1928) in Toronto, then established operations in the UK in 1906 (with a head office at Stevenage, Hertfordshire) and later into the United States with offices in Atlanta.

Macdonald retired in 1920 and was succeeded by Charles Strange Macdonald from 1921 to 1946 and then John Kenneth Macdonald from 1946 to 1969. John Kenneth MacDonald's daughters, Peggy Latimer and Ann Macintosh, never were operationally involved in the firm, but they did inherit ownership from their father.

In 1969, J. Craig Davidson became president and for the first time, the firm was no longer led by a member of the Macdonald family.


### Demise

Confederation Life was forced into liquidation in 1994, with the process beginning on August 11. The international operations of the company made the liquidation process somewhat complex.

The company had financial obligations to 260,000 individual policyholders in Canada and to another 1.5 million members of a group insurance plan through the company.

During the liquidation process, CompCorp, by then called Assuris, was able to guarantee the assets of all policyholders, and the process cost the compensation fund only CA$5 million.

The various blocks of business of the company were taken over by various Canadian and American insurance companies. The liquidator was KPMG. As of 2010, the process was still ongoing.

It was the third liquidation of an insurance company in Canada in consecutive years, following Les Coopérants in 1992 and Sovereign Life in 1993. and was followed in 2012 by *Union of Canada Life*.
