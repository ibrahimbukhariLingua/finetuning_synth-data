## History


### Foundation

Since its foundation in 1912, Opus Global has gone through many turning points until it took its current form. Among these, it should be mentioned that when the Opus Global became a member of the issuer circle of the Budapest Stock Exchange, its shares were listed on the BSE from 1998. From 1999 to 2009, a major reorganization program was carried out, as a result of which a holding primarily dealing with the management and asset management of companies of various profiles was created.


### The last 10 years

2017 was a milestone in the life of Opus Global, when major transformations took place in both the ownership and management structure. In the first half of 2017, Lőrinc Mészáros became the majority owner of the company. As a result of the transformation, Opus Global's numbers fundamentally strengthened and entered the Budapest Stock Exchange's premium category, and have been a member of BSE's prominent index baskets.

Opus Global borrowed 130 million euros to buy the gas and electricity distribution firm Titász from MKB Bank.

In order to create market embeddedness and investor confidence, Opus Global merged with Konzum Nyrt. in 2019, a merger of two public issuers was unprecedented in the history of the Hungarian stock market. As a result of the capital increases, Opus Global became the Budapest Stock Exchange's 5th largest company, with several industrial and manufacturing companies from the main sectors of the Hungarian economy in its portfolio.

In 2023's first quarter Opus Global reported considerable improvement on bottom line on a consolidated level for the first quarter. Although it is not a surprise that the company faced a major increase in (especially material related) costs, operating income could eventually outperform this large increase, which could therefore translate into a meaningful improvement on EBIT. Important to mention is that the company has reported that no significant acquisitions took place that would blur data comparability.
