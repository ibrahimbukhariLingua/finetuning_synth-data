## Career

In the same year, he also created the parent company of Chemdex, called Ventro Corporation which was later sold to Nexprise. He served as its CEO and President until November 2001.

In 2002, Perry co-founded Anacor Pharmaceuticals and served as its CEO for twelve years. The biopharmaceutical company is focused on developing novel small-molecule therapeutics to treat infectious and inflammatory diseases. In 2016, the company was acquired by Pfizer for $5.4 billion.

In 2015, Perry co-founded Better Therapeutics (also known as FareWell), a digital therapeutics company focused on preventing and reversing chronic disease through lifestyle changes. He is also on the board of directors of the human microbiome company, Evelo Biosciences.
