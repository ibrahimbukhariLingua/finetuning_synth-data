# Saks Global



**Saks Global** is the American division of the Canadian holding company Hudson's Bay Company, founded in July 2024. It is also the successor to the Neiman Marcus Group, which was acquired by HBC in December 2024.

The division includes the operations and properties of luxury department stores Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue; off-price department stores Neiman Marcus Last Call and Saks Off 5th; and home furnishings website Horchow. HBC-owned Canadian department store Hudson's Bay is managed by a distinct Canadian division with this reorganization.

## History

Saks Global was created in 2024 after the Canadian Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) purchased the American Neiman Marcus Group (NMG). The acquisition was finalized in December 2024 and the purchase cost $2.7 billion. The acquisition brought together Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th, HBC also owns the Hudson’s Bay and Zellers department stores.

The purchase was supported with financing from Amazon (who will work with the group to “to innovate on behalf of customers and brand partners”), Authentic Brands Group, G-III Apparel Group and Salesforce. There is also the possibility of store closures across Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. In an interview with Vogue Business, Metrick (CEO of Saks Global Operating Group) said that this is only the beginning of the groups ambitions and that they are now thinking of what the entity might look like internationally.
