# Construction Monitor



**Construction Monitor** is a business that makes building permit information available to suppliers, subcontractors, and building industry professionals in the construction industry. Construction Monitor provide records of residential, commercial, swimming pool and solar building permits in a searchable database. This lead generation service is available in all 50 US states, making Construction Monitor the nation's largest provider of real-time building permit data.


## History

The company was founded in 1989 by David B. Mineer Sr. in Parowan, Utah. Mineer's work as a commercial architect brought him to city offices where he observed construction professionals waiting in line to view the most recent building permits. He offered to collect the permits and mail them directly to the builders, and that service of mailing permits is the foundation on which the business was formed. While the business started as a mailed newsletter, it has since transitioned to an online database.
