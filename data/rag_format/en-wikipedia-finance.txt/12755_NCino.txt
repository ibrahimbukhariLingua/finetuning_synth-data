## Legal issues


### Antitrust and wage suppression investigations

nCino faced antitrust investigations and a lawsuit in 2021. The company filed an SEC Form 8-K in February 2021, stating it received grand jury subpoenas from the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division seeking information on its hiring and wage practices. In March 2021, a class-action lawsuit was filed alleging nCino, Live Oak Bank, and Apiture conspired to avoid hiring each other's employees.

The Department of Justice closed its investigation into nCino's in February 2023, stating there would be no further action taken in the matter. While Live Oak Bank settled the class action lawsuit for $4.65 million in March 2022, nCino did not sign the settlement agreement and continues to repudiate the allegations following the conclusion of the government's investigation.


### Insider trading allegations

In September 2022, nCino's majority owner, Insight Ventures, as well as the nCino board members were sued by The City of Hialeah Employee Retirement System for "using nonpublic information about ongoing discussions between nCino and SimpleNexus to substantially increase its investment and ownership interests in SimpleNexus before the transaction took place."
