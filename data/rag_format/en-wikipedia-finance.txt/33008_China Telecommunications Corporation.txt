On 27 April 1995, it was registered as a separate legal entity as **Directorate General of Telecommunications, P&T, China**, using "China Telecom" as brand name.

It also owned subsidiaries in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan and Shandong that formerly belonged to China Telecommunications Corporation. According to the United States Department of Defense, the company has links to the People's Liberation Army.

On 10 September 2002, a subsidiary, China Telecom, was listed. The listed company gradually acquired the assets from China Telecommunications Corporation. As of 31 December 2016ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, however, China Telecommunications Corporation still owned the controlling stake in the company, for 70.89%.

On 7 January 2009, China Telecommunications Corporation was awarded CDMA 2000 license to expand its business to 3G telecommunication.


### U.S. sanctions

In November 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. companies and individuals from owning shares in companies that the United States Department of Defense has listed as having links to the People's Liberation Army, which included China Telecom. In consequence of the executive order, the New York Stock Exchange delisted China Telecom in January 2021.

In December 2020, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initiated proceedings to revoke China Telecom's authorization to operate in the U.S. due to national security concerns. In October 2021, the FCC revoked China Telecom's operating license in the U.S. In March 2022, the FCC designated a U.S. subsidiary of the company, China Telecom (Americas) Corp, a national security threat. In December 2024, the United States Department of Commerce moved to crack down on China Telecom's cloud and internet routing business in the U.S.


## Consolidation and expansion

On 2 June 2008, the company announced it would acquire China Unicom's CDMA business and network for CN¥110 billion in cash, a series of transactions aimed at transforming the company into a fully integrated telecommunications operator.

Such shifts mark a new era for the telecommunications industry in China in which analyst have further commented that these changes are aimed at promoting a more fair and competitive industry environment.

China Telecom was chosen by the Chinese Government as an investor in the Philippines for providing telecom services. They were later chosen as 'provisional' telecommunications provider of the country after a bidding led by the Philippine government on November 7, 2018. As current laws restrict foreign ownership to 40%, China Telecom (through its parent company) forms a venture with local companies Udenna Corporation (owner of Phoenix Petroleum) and Chelsea Logistics under the franchise of Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc (or the Mislatel consortium). The selection was formalized on 20 November after the Philippine National Telecommunications Commission junked petitions from its rival bids. On 8 July 2019, Mislatel was renamed to Dito Telecommunity and at the same time, was granted its permit to operate. The firm began its commercial operations on 8 March 2021.
