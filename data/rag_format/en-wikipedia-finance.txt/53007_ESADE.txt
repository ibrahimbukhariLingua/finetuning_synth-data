**Esade** (Escola Superior d'Administració i Direcció d'Empreses) is an international private educational institution based in Barcelona, Spain. Esade runs two schools of the university, Esade Business School and Esade Law School, as well as a language centre, the Esade Executive Language Center. The school has also formed a strategic alliance with Ramon Llull University in its undergraduate programmes in Law and Business. ESADE is ranked among the world's top business schools and law school programs by the Financial Times, The Economist, Forbes, QS World University Rankings and more.


## History

The Esade project was conceived in the spring of 1954 by a group of Spanish professionals and entrepreneurs who later founded the university. The school signed an agreement with the Jesuits (Societas Iesu) in October 1958 and started offering its first academic programs in a small building in the district of Sant Gervasi, Barcelona.

In 1958, Esade was ultimately founded. Two years later, in 1960, executive education programmes were introduced. In 1964 the college's MBA programme was established. A year later, in 1965, ESADE's Barcelona campus (Av. Pedralbes) opened (Building I), as well as the Executive Language Centre. In 1993, Esade Law School opened. In 2001, the school inaugurated its campus in Madrid (Chamartín). In 2009 Esade opened a new campus in Sant Cugat (Barcelona) as well as Esade Creapolis, a technology park based on open innovation and situated on the new Sant Cugat campus.

Today Esade's campuses, if the premises in both Madrid and Barcelona are included, cover an area of 30,000m².


## Esade Creapolis

Esade Creapolis is a joint venture between Esade, a consortium of Spanish financial institutions, local government institutions and business associations. The organisation manages a technology and innovation park on the Esade campus in Sant Cugat, Barcelona. It is an open innovation centre promoted by Esade business school, where companies, students, the academic community and scientists come together intending to promote both creativity and innovation. Between 2005 and 2008 Esade Creapolis invested €70 Million in its facilities in Sant Cugat and has since become home to various startups.
