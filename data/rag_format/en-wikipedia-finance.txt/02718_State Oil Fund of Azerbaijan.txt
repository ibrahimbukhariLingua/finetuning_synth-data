# State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan



The **State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan** (Azerbaijani: *Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dövlət Neft Fondu*), also known by its abbreviation **SOFAZ**, is a sovereign wealth fund of Azerbaijan founded in December 1999. Nearly all the fund's revenues come from Azerbaijan's oil and gas exports. The fund has been criticized for its lack of transparency and for enriching Azerbaijan's political elites.


## History and organization

The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) was established by Heydar Aliyev's Decree No. 240 dated December 29, 1999. Statute of the State Oil Fund was approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan No. 434 dated December 29, 2000.

SOFAZ has been criticized for lacking transparency in its finances and in its contracting, which has raised questions about corruption. Critics have described projects funded by SOFAZ as useless, and noted that contracts have been awarded to companies owned by the ruling Aliyev family in Azerbaijan. Funds from SOFAZ are frequently transferred to make up for state deficits.

In 2024, the revenue generated by SOFAZ from the sale of oil from the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field was US$ 5,725 billion. SOFAZ owns 25% of the shares amongst BP, ExxonMobil, Amoco, Unocal, Statoil, McDermott and others.
