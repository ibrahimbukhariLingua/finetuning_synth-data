In July 2018, Bromford successfully completed a partnership with South West-based Merlin Housing Society to create a new organisation which retained the Bromford name. As of 2024 Bromford owns and manages around 47,000 homes and provides services for approximately 110,000 people living in those homes. Bromford's 2023 - 2027 Strategy sets out its goal to build 11,000 new homes by 2030 and to be the leading developer of affordable homes in Gloucestershire and the wider M5 corridor.


## History

In 1918 rented housing comprised 70% of the market but only a fraction of these homes were deemed to be ‘affordable’ or ‘social’. There were a number of charitable housing bodies such as the Guinness Trust and Peabody Trust, and some industrial companies who supplied rented homes for their workers but they were relatively small in number. Local authorities only started to provide rented homes in any volume after the Great War. The development of new affordable housing by housing associations (HA) was an objective of the established charitable organisations such as Peabody and Cadbury but they expanded only slowly until the 1960s.

Bromford Housing Association Limited, named after Bromford Bridge railway station in the Bromford area of Birmingham, was formed by a group of housing sector professionals in 1963. They formed a management committee run by quantity surveyor and Chairman Charles Bucknall, estate agent Robert Oulsnam and solicitor Keith James. In order to take advantage of loans from the new Housing Corporation an entirely new association had to be formed as a ‘society’. This became ‘Second Bromford Housing Society’.

Bromford's first scheme was built at West Heath Road in Birmingham.
