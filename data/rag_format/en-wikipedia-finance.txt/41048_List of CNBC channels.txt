# List of CNBC channels



This is a **list of channels broadcast under the CNBC brand** (formerly **Consumer News and Business Channel**) by NBCUniversal and its affiliates around the world. Following on from the original United States–based channel, launched in 1989, European and Asian versions were established in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Since then, sub-continental and local language versions of the channel have been created in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, many under a licensing agreement. At present, sixteen distinct CNBC channels exist worldwide, of which seven are wholly owned by NBCUniversal and a further nine have NBCUniversal as a minority stakeholder or a licensor. A further channel, the Korean language operated SBS-CNBC, began broadcasting on December 28, 2009, in conjunction with Seoul Broadcasting System. Later, the Indonesian Language operated CNBC Indonesia, is launched in 2018 in conjunction with Trans Media.
