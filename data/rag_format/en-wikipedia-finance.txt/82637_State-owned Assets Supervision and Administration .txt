The **State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council** (**SASAC**) is a special commission of the People's Republic of China, directly under the State Council. It was founded in 2003 through the consolidation of various other industry-specific ministries. SASAC is responsible for managing state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including appointing top executives and approving any mergers or sales of stock or assets, as well as drafting laws related to SOEs.

As of 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, its companies had a combined assets of CN¥871 trillion (~US$116 trillion), revenue of more than CN¥85.37 trillion (~US$12 trillion) with a total profit of 4.63 trillion yuan according to a report from SASAC.
Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing is responsible for the supervision of the SASAC.


## History

SASAC was formed in 2003 to consolidate industry-specific bureaucracies.¹⁵

In 2017, the State Council approved a change of SASAC's mission from administering SOEs to channeling state capital into strategic economic sectors.¹⁶


## Significance

SASAC oversees China's SOEs in nonfinancial industries deemed strategically important by the State Council, including national champions in areas like energy, infrastructure, strategic minerals, and civil aviation.⁷⁹

The state-owned investment companies of SASAC serve as a mechanism through which the Chinese government can influence the market through the use of capital rather than government directive.¹⁶


## Central SOEs

As of 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, SASAC currently oversees 97 centrally owned companies. These central SOEs (*yangqi*) are SOEs that cover industries deemed most vital to the national economy.⁶ Companies directly supervised by SASAC are continuously reduced through mergers according to the state-owned enterprise restructuring plan with the number of SASAC companies down from over 150 in 2008.
