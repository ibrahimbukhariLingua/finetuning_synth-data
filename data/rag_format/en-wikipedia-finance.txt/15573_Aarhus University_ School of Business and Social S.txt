Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences


# Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences



The **Aarhus University School of Business and Social Sciences** (in short **Aarhus BSS**) is one of four faculties of Aarhus University in Denmark. The school consists of seven departments: Economics and Business Economics, Management, Political Science, Law, Business Communication, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences and Department of Business Development and Technology (located in the city of Herning). The main campus is located in Aarhus.

Aarhus BSS is a merger from 2007 and teaches programmes at Bachelor's, Master and PhD level along with the MBA (Master of Business Administration), EMBA (Executive MBA) programmes and Summer University and Winter school courses. In 2010 Dale T. Mortensen, a Niels Bohr Visiting Professor at Aarhus University, received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences together with his colleagues Peter Diamond and Christopher Pissarides.


## History

The history of the Aarhus BSS is both old and new. On 1 January 2007, Aarhus School of Business (Danish: *Handelshøjskolen*; ASB) merged into Aarhus University. In 2011, the Aarhus School of Business and the Faculty of Social Sciences at Aarhus University were merged under the name of Aarhus University, School of Business and Social Sciences. Aarhus School of Business had been founded in 1939, and the Faculty of Social Sciences consisted of several departments and faculties established between 1936 and 1969. The 2011 merger made Aarhus BSS one of the largest business schools in Europe.

The Aarhus School of Business's predecessor, The Jutland Business School (Danish: *Den Jyske Handelshøjskole*; DJH), has a somewhat more extensive history. Already in the late 1800s, DJH provided business programmes to young people from Jutland who wished to follow studies within business, economics and trade. The Aarhus School of Business continually grew since its founding. In 1968 Aarhus School of Business moved from the original location downtown Aarhus to the yellow and red brick buildings which house the Aarhus School of Business today.

Thomas Pallesen is Dean of Aarhus BSS. The school's Executive Team is formed by the Dean, the Vice-Dean for research and talent development, Per Baltzer Overgaard and the Vice-Dean for education, Peder Østergaard.


## Campus and student life

The School of Business and Social Sciences has its main campus around University Park, the Nobel Park, and campus Fuglesangs Allé, all located in the centre of Aarhus. In 2006, the Institute of Business and Technology in Herning (now AU Herning) was merged with Aarhus University, adding Birk Centerpark in Herning to the campus sites of School of Business and Social Sciences.

The campuses in Aarhus and Herning offer a number of facilities, including Aarhus University Sport (AUS) which hosts more than 16 different sports activities and Denmark's biggest Sports Day and Friday Bar, libraries on all campus sites, student organisations like Studenterlauget and the Student Council, and cafeterias and cafes like Dale's café, Aarhus Student House and Klubben.
