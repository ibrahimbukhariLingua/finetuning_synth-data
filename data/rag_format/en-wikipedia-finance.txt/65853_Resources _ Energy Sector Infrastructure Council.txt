Resources & Energy Sector Infrastructure Council


# Resources & Energy Sector Infrastructure Council



The **Resources and Energy Sector Infrastructure Council** (**RESIC**) was created by the State Government of South Australia in 2007 to support the development of future infrastructure projects. It was a small group of senior executives selected to represent the industry and public sector's leaders. The council facilitates close working relationships between private and public sectors on infrastructure planning and development matters and aims to foster cooperation between companies to maximize the value of proposed infrastructure and minimize unnecessary duplication.

RESIC initiated a Resource and Energy Infrastructure Demand Study in 2011, which led to the development of a Regional Mining and Infrastructure Plan, prepared by Deloitte. The plan recommended the establishment of a Resource Infrastructure Taskforce (RIT).

In 2015, RESIC merged with the Resources Industry Development Board (RIDB), forming the Minerals and Energy Advisory Council.
