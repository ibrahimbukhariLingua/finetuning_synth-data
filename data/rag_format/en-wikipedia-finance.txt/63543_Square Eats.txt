### COVID-19 initiative

By mid-2020, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic where demand for services delivering items surged, Square Eats announced it had "stockpiled thousands of gloves and bottles of hand sanitizer" and was offering them to delivery drivers for free. The company also said it had changed the default drop-off option to contactless delivery. Square Eats became the fastest growing meal delivery service during the course of the pandemic in Botswana.
