The first fund to be managed by Graphite Capital was F&C Enterprise Trust, a UK listed vehicle, which it renamed Graphite Enterprise Trust when the management buyout took place in 2001. The fund became ICG Enterprise Trust when the management contract was transferred to Intermediate Capital Group in 2016.
