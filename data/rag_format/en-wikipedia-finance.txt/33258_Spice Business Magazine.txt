## Content

In 1998, *Spice Business Magazine* was launched. It features articles about UK food manufacturers, food and drinks distributors, doctor surgeries, dentists, jewellery shops, travel agents, Asian entrepreneurs, cash and carries, halal groceries, wholesalers, and Indian restaurants - as well as prominent figures within the business community.

The magazine was set by British Bangladeshi Enam Ali to tackle the problems of the curry industry in the UK. In the beginning, the 42-page magazine was sold at 2 pounds.
