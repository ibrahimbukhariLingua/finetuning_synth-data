Céntimo


# Céntimo



The **céntimo** (in Spanish-speaking countries) or **cêntimo** (in Portuguese-speaking countries) was a currency unit of Spain, Portugal and their former colonies. The word derived from the Latin *centimus* meaning "hundredth part". The main Spanish currency, before the euro, was the peseta which was divided into 100 céntimos. In Portugal it was the real and later the escudo, until it was also replaced by the euro. In the European community *cent* is the official name for one hundredth of a euro. However, both *céntimo* (in Spanish) and *cêntimo* (in Portuguese) are commonly used to describe the euro cent.
