## History and establishment

In 1965, the State Government of Victoria established a Consumer Protection Council, the first government general consumer body established in Australia

The Consumer Protection Council was established essentially to consider issues and to advise the Government. The Council was not formally set up to handle complaints, but this became a dominant part of its work. New legislation in 1973 also established a Minister of Consumer Affairs tied to the Department of Labour and Industry. They were substantially cut by the Kennett Government and the Ministry was abolished and absorbed into a new Department of Justice.


## Goals and purpose

The Consumer Affairs Victoria vision is "informed and responsible consumers and traders, who know their rights and responsibilities" Its goals are:

* Empower consumers
* Create a competitive, fair, and safe trading environment
* Protect vulnerable and disadvantaged consumers
* Optimise our organisational capability.

## Activities and operations

A past Director of Consumer Affairs, Dr David Cousins, described the role of Consumer Affairs Victoria thus:

"Consumer Affairs has essentially three key roles. These are firstly to advise the government on the consumer policy framework and to manage the legislative and non-legislative program related to this framework. Secondly, Consumer Affairs is a significant regulator of industry conduct, monitors entry regulation in some industries, and manages guarantee funds covering residential tenancies, property services and motor car trading. Thirdly, Consumer Affairs is a major service provider of information, advice, education, complaint-handling (primarily through the provision of third party conciliation and mediation services) and licensing services."
