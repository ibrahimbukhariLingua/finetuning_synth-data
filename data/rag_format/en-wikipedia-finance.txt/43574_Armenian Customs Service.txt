# Armenian Customs Service



The **Armenian Customs Service** (Armenian: Հայաստանի մաքսային ծառայություն) is a subsidiary department of the State Revenue Committee responsible for customs services on behalf of the Armenian government, headquartered in Yerevan.


## History

The Armenian Customs Service is the authoritative body which regulates customs services in Armenia, ensures compliance of Armenia's international trade and customs agreements, and is responsible for the collection of customs payments and tariffs for foreign trade. The department was established on 4 January 1992 and ensures that customs regulations are followed for incoming trade and goods to Armenia. Department staff are also responsible to ensure that contraband items which are prohibited for entry are monitored at all checkpoints. Between 2018 and 2020, the Armenian Customs Service was nominated to represent the Audit Committee of the World Customs Organization, representing the European region alongside the Tax and Customs Administration of the Netherlands.
