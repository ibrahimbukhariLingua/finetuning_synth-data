# Peter Rigby



**Sir Peter Rigby** DL (born 29 September 1943) is a British entrepreneur. He is chairman and chief executive of Rigby Group PLC, and is one of Britain's richest people.


## Early life

Rigby was born in 1943 in Liverpool and went to a local grammar school. He learned to fly at 15 and wanted a career in the Royal Air Force but the health of his father meant he instead took a graduate position with National Cash Register Company in their electronic processing division. There he learned to program and design computer systems.


## Career


### Specialist Computer Centres

Peter Rigby founded SCC (Specialist Computer Centres) in 1975 with an initial cash investment of just £2,000. Rigby has maintained control of the company over 40 years of sustained growth and has seen SCC's turnover rise to £2.038 billion (2005).

In May 2012, a company press release claimed that turnover to year end March 2012, had risen to £2.75billion, a 10% rise on the previous yearly period. Peter Rigby claims that if SCC were a public company, turnover would be as much as £14 billion.

SCC is now the largest privately owned technology company in Europe.

His sons, James Rigby (SCC CEO) and Steven Rigby (European GM) are both directors on the board of Rigby Group, while Peter Rigby is chairman and group CEO.

In June 2013 it bought Exeter International Airport. In June 2014 it bought Norwich International Airport, and in December 2017, Bournemouth Airport.
