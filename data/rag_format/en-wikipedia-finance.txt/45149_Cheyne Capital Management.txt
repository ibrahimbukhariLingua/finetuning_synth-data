Cheyne Capital Management


# Cheyne Capital Management



**Cheyne Capital** is a London-based alternative asset manager. The firm launched its first fund in 2000 and today specializes in real estate debt, social property impact, corporate credit, convertible bonds, event driven investing and equities.

Cheyne Capital's SIV, "Cheyne Finance PLC" was forced into liquidation because of losses. Deloitte & Touche were appointed as receivers.

The Cheyne group currently employs approximately 170 people in its 12 offices world-wide.

The firm's co-founder, Stuart Fiertz, was a member of the 14-person Hedge Fund Working Group, which devised best practice policies regarding financial valuation, transparency, and risk management. Those guidelines evolved into what is now the Standards Board for Alternative Investments, a self-regulatory body of which Cheyne is a member. It is also a member of the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), the global representative of the alternative investment industry. In April 2014, Stuart Fiertz was appointed as a Director of the AIMA Global Council and is Chair of AIMAâ€™s Alternative Credit Council, a committee of alternative asset management firms which are financing the real economy.


## History
