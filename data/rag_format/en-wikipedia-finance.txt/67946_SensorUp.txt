# SensorUp



**SensorUp Inc.** is a Canadian company based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, specializing in methane emissions management software. It is recognized for its advancements in the oil and gas sector with its methane emissions management SaaS platform, SensorUp GEMS, and for developing the Open Geospatial Consortium SensorThings API standard specification.


## Expansion into Oil and Gas

In late 2022, **SensorUp Inc.** leveraged its foundational IoT expertise to expand into the oil and gas industry by introducing the SensorUp Gas Emissions Management Solution (GEMS), a SaaS platform for methane emissions management. This was a strategic move marked by the launch of a new website featuring SensorUp GEMS in June 2023. The GEMS platform integrates various data sources, including methane emission sensor data from most 3rd parties, Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) inspection data, and operational data from SCADA and ERP systems, to provide a solution for methane leak detection and repair (LDAR).


## SensorUp GEMS

SensorUp GEMS, designed for the oil and gas industry, focuses on methane emissions management. This SaaS platform integrates with direct measurement and detection technology, including OGI, flyovers, ERP, and SCADA systems, for precise methane detection data gathering and quantification. It facilitates emissions reduction by utilizing measurement data, emission factors, and methane reduction technologies. Compliant with the GHG Protocol, SensorUp GEMS contributes to methane intensity assessment and operational efficiency. The platform supports regulatory reporting and MRV processes, aligning with decarbonization, carbon-neutral, and net-zero targets. Adhering to transparency and stakeholder engagement, SensorUp GEMS aligns with OGMP 2.0, GTI Veritas, and MiQ standards, emphasizing responsible gas management and ESG suite requirements.


## Impact and Customer Adoption

SensorUp’s GEMS platform has been adopted by the energy sector, including Oxy (Occidental Petroleum), to optimize methane reduction and advance low-carbon business objectives. With its approach to managing methane emissions, SensorUp GEMS is a critical tool for energy companies seeking to transition towards net-zero operations and reduce their carbon footprint.


## Leadership and Series B Funding

In July 2023, SensorUp announced a significant milestone with a CAD 12 million Series B funding round led by Climate Investment (OGCI). This funding round, supported by Evok Innovations, will accelerate product development and expand sales channels of SensorUp's gas emissions management solution. In the same month, Terry Cunningham, an executive with extensive experience in SaaS, enterprise software, and cloud computing, was appointed as the new CEO of SensorUp. Cunningham's appointment coincides with SensorUp's intensified focus on the methane emissions management landscape. Dr. Steve Liang, Founder, continues in the CTO role.


## History

In 2014, SensorUp received funding supports from Natural Resources Canada's GeoConnections and TecTerra. In 2016, as part of the OGC Internet of Things pilot project SensorUp demonstrated its interoperable OGC SensorThings API platform solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ at the Department of Homeland Security. Dr. Reginald Brothers, the Undersecretary of the Homeland Security Science and Technology, was "impressed with the ‘state of the practical’ where these various industry sensors can be integrated today using open standards that remove the stovepipe limitations of one-off technologies. " In March 2016 SensorUp submitted a new open source software project proposal, titled Whiskers, to the Eclipse Foundation. Whiskers will be an open source Javascript client library for the OGC SensorThings API and a light-weight OGC SensorThings API server for IoT gateways (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

In June 2016, SensorUp joined the ESRI Startup Program, a three-year program that gives us the tools to build mapping and location analytics capabilities into Esri products.

In September 2016, SensorUp partnered with Libelium to cloud-enable Libelium sensor networks with international OGC and ISO standards for the IoT.

In November 2016, SensorUp joined the TELUS T-squared Accelerator.

In January 2017, with the support of Natural Resources Canada, SensorUp launched the Smart City Starter Kit.

The starter kit allows a city or community to set up a large-scale IoT-based smart city solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ in one afternoon.

In July 2017, SensorUp launched the CloudUAV platform, empowering UAV researchers and users to manage their UAV workflow with an online portal and a smartphone application, based on the OGC SensorThings API.

In May 2018, SensorUp won the NATO Defence Innovation Challenge Award for secured federation of IoT devices.

In June 2018, SensorUp announced that it had raised $2 million in seed financing, led by Vanedge Capital, to create new data-driven IoT business solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ for Smart Cities, First Responders, and Oil and Gas Field Services.

In June 2018, SensorUp was selected to present at the Creative Destruction Lab's 2018 super session plenary session.

In September 2018, SensorUp was selected by the Plug and Play Tech Center, joined the IoT Fall 2018 Batch, and presented at Plug and Play's Winter Summit 2018.

In December 2018, SensorUp provided the OGC SensorThings API for a Department of Homeland Security Next Generation First Responder initiative's operational experimentation in Houston, Texas. SensorUp's SensorThings facilitated sensor integration and data provisioning for situational awareness and the common operating picture.
