## History


### Founding and Early Growth (2002-2005)

Sunwing Group was founded in 2002 by Colin Hunter. By 2004, Sunwing had become the second largest tour operator in Ontario. On November 17, 2005, Sunwing Airlines' inaugural flight, a Boeing 737-800, departed from Toronto Pearson International Airport.


### Expansion through Acquisitions (2009-2011)

In 2009, Sunwing Group embarked on a strategic expansion, announcing the acquisition of tour operator Signature Vacations and its SellOffVacations.com retail division from UK-based TUI Travel. This acquisition led to TUI gaining a 49 percent ownership stake in Sunwing Travel Group, and Stephen Hunter stepping into the role of CEO, succeeding his father.

In 2010, Sunwing Travel Group acquired *Caribbean NexusTours*, a tour operator in the Dominican Republic and Mexico. The company was renamed NexusTours and remains a separate company within Sunwing Travel Group.

In 2011, Sunwing Travel Group announced that it would enter the European market with a seasonal service from Canada to Europe. However, this initiative did not materialize as expected, and there have been no records of regular flights to Europe under the Sunwing banner since this announcement. Later that year, Sunwing Travel Group further diversified its portfolio with the purchase of Luxe Destination Weddings. This acquisition allowed Sunwing to offer a wider range of services to its customers, particularly in the area of destination weddings.

In 2012, Sunwing Travel Group acquired the Atlanta-based tour operator Vacation Express for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition was the group's entrance to the US market.

In 2015, Sunwing Group announced that affiliate, Blue Diamond Resorts, would open a 600-room resort in Jamaica. Later that year, the company began construction on $400 million resort in Antigua with 500 rooms.


### Integration with WestJet Group (2023-Present)

Sunwing Travel Group became a subsidiary of the WestJet Group on May 1, 2023, following an acquisition announced in March 2022. This merger aimed to:

* **Consolidate market share:** By combining two major players in the Canadian travel industry, the acquisition significantly strengthens WestJet's position, particularly in vacation packages and sun destinations.
* **Expand service offerings:** WestJet gains access to Sunwing's expertise in vacation packages, allowing it to offer a more comprehensive range of travel solutions to its customers.
* **Optimize operations:** The combined entity anticipates cost efficiencies and operational improvements through the integration of resources and processes.

As of February 13, 2024, Sunwing continues to operate as a separate brand and entity within the WestJet Group. However, full integration of Sunwing Airlines into WestJet's core operations is expected by October 2024.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Sunwing Vacations will maintain its current branding throughout the integration process under the Sunwing Vacations Group umbrella.

On May 14, 2024, the Sunwing Travel Group announced the launch of WestJet Vacations Quebec (*Vacances WestJet Quebec*), a new vacation provider specifically catering to Quebec residents. This offering focuses on all-inclusive getaways to 20 popular sun destinations across the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico. The provider will offer packages from three airports in Quebec: Montréal–Trudeau International Airport, Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport and Saguenay-Bagotville Airport.
