French Confederation of Christian Workers


# French Confederation of Christian Workers



The **French Confederation of Christian Workers** (French: Confédération française des travailleurs chrétiens; **CFTC**) is one of the five major French confederation of trade unions, belonging to the social Christian tradition.

It was founded in 1919 as the Trade Union of Employees of Industry and Commerce under the inspiration of Exupérien Mas with the goal of safeguarding the material as well as the spiritual interests of its members. In 1964, the union split, a majority founding the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT), a non-confessional trade-union.

The CFTC is a member of the International Trade Union Confederation and the European Trade Union Confederation. Its leader is Jacques Voisin.

The CFTC won 8.69% of the vote in the employee's college during the 2008 professional elections. This result, however, is below the CFTC's 9.65% result in 2002, its best showing to date. In 2021 the CFTC won 11% of the vote.
