Trinity Walk


# Trinity Walk



**Trinity Walk** is a shopping centre in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. England. Opened on 6 May 2011, Wakefield Council describe it as "the most important City Centre development for more than 20 years."


## Retail scheme

Trinity Walk is 560,000 sq ft partially enclosed shopping centre with over 70 stores and 1,000 car parking spaces, with access from Wakefield’s inner city ring road (A61) and the main bus station. The centre contains major stores, including an 8,500 m² Sainsbury's and retailers Sports Direct, Søstrene Grene, Next, New Look, and Pandora.

The centre recorded its record year for footfall in 2024 with around 11.35 million visits.


## History

On 19 March 2009, it appeared that the development was going to fall victim to the credit crunch when KPMG were called in as administrators as the Anglo Irish Bank withdrew its support for the project. Building work stopped and the steel structure stood half finished.

The scheme was rescued in early 2010 by a consortium who bought the development from administrators – a joint venture company comprising Sovereign Land, AREA Property Partners, and Shepherd Building Group.

Trinity Walk opened on Friday 6 May 2011.


## Wakefield regeneration

Trinity Walk has created hundreds of new jobs in the city.
