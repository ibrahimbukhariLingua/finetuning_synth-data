# COMCEC



The **Standing Committee for Economic and Commercial Cooperation** (**COMCEC**) is one of four standing committees of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). It was established in 1981 at the Third Islamic Summit Conference held in Mecca/Ta'if and serves as a multilateral economic and commercial cooperation forum in the Islamic world. The committee convenes annually at ministerial level in Istanbul under the Chairmanship of the President of the Republic of Turkey.

The organization defines its scope of cooperation by trade, transport, agriculture, tourism, poverty alleviation, and financial as well as private sector cooperation.

## The Trade Preferential System (TPS-OIC)

The Trade Preferential System aims to promote trade among the Member States of the OIC by means of exchanging preferences. It includes a Most-Favored Nation clause, providing that all states participating in the TPS-OIC receive equal trade advantages as the "most favoured nation" by the country granting such treatment.


### Trade among OIC countries

The official website indicates a goal of 20% intra-OIC trade by the year 2015. However, some economists consider this goal to be unrealistic.

| Year | intra-OIC trade (as % of total trade) |
| --- | --- |
| 2009 | 16,7% |
| 2010 | 17,0% |
| 2011 | 17,8% |
| 2012 | N.A. |
| 2013 | 18,2% |
