Sunshine Empire


# Sunshine Empire



**Sunshine Empire** was a Multi Level Marketing (MLM) company, set up in 2006, based in Singapore. It is now defunct, with assets frozen by the Singapore Court. The company is listed by the Singapore Government's Monetary Authority in its Investor's Alert List, for possibly running investment schemes without authority. After investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police and a court trial, Sunshine Empire's Directors were charged with and found guilty of fraud, criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts.

The company had gathered up to S$189 million in funds through investment schemes, alleged to have never materialised and to have been in fact, part of a Ponzi scheme. Initial trial revealed that over S$115m were paid out as 'investment returns', while another S$40m were transferred to associates as 'interest free loans' and the remaining believed to have been expended or paid out to directors as fees.


## History

Prior to the existence of Sunshine Empire, its founders had had a long history of establishing similar investment schemes under various business names, with none ever having been materialized. The projects were claimed to have failed, and investors would have been unable to recoup anything after the fund collection was completed. However, its founders had evaded legal charges by operating on legal loopholes in their contracts.


## Management

It was reported that there was also a group of middle-aged people who were trained separately from the majority and who drove luxury sedans like Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs despite being only in their early twenties.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ These "car achievers" were also known as managers who always dressed smartly in black suits and carried Montblanc pens and wallets. According to a former member of Sunshine Empire, these managers would take other members out for supper after the *training sessions* because they said it would foster bonding and that it was an opportunity for other members to see the cars they drove.

### Events leading to investigations

The fact that Sunshine Empire's merchants could notch up what seemed like profits without ever buying or selling products meant that its business model resembled a pure financial investment scheme or Ponzi scheme.

There have been allegations that the Sunshine Empire was a Pyramid scheme, with victims in East Asian Countries.

Sunshine Empire was placed on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) investor alert list and Malaysia's Securities Commission alert list.

On 8 October 2008, the Consumers Association of Singapore's executive director, Seah Seng Choon, cautioned participants against transferring their money to Hong Kong, as it would put their investment outside Singapore's jurisdiction.

On 24 October 2008, it was reported that James Phang Wah did not own Sunshine Empire but was just a charismatic adviser to Sunshine.
