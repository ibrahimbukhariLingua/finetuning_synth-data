## History

In 2000, and in the process of changes to the levels of the structures surrounding shareholders in the Banco Comercial de Moçambique (BCM), the principal shareholder of Banco Internacional de Moçambique, the Banco Comercial Português would go on to become the shareholder of reference of the BCM and the Banco Internacional de Moçambique. This evolution determined the necessity that would proceed the merging of the two entities, which concluded in 2001. With this operation, the new structure of the bank maintained the designation of one of the banks of the Banco Internacional de Moçambique.

In 2006, the Banco Comercial Português rebranded as Millennium in every region where it was present.[¹] In alignment with this, Banco Internacional de Moçambique began to do business as Millennium bim as a commercial brand.
