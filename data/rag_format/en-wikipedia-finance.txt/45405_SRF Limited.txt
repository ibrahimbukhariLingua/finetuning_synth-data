## History

The company was established in 1970, as **Shri Ram Fibres Limited**, by DCM Limited as a wholly owned subsidiary. Its initial focus was on the manufacture of tyre cord fabrics. Its first manufacturing plant was set up in Manali, near Chennai, in 1973.

In 1986, the company set up a joint venture with Denso called SRF Nippondenso, for the manufacture of automotive components. This was later spun off as a separate company in 1993. Another subsidiary, SRF Finance, started in 1986 was sold to GE Capital in 1997. SRF also had a healthcare division which manufactured plastic optical lenses, which was spun off as a separate company in 1997.

In 1989, the company entered the chemicals business to manufacture refrigerants. Consequently, in 1990, it changed its name to SRF Limited.

The company started its packaging films business in 1995 when it acquired a BOPET film plant at Kashipur in India from Flowmore. SRF has since then manufactured both BOPET and BOPP films globally.

The company entered the specialty chemicals business in 2004 as a supplier of fine chemicals to the agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals industry. The business is engaged in custom synthesis, and contract research and manufacturing.
