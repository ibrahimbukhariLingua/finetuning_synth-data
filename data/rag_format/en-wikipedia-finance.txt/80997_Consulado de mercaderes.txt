Consulado de mercaderes


# Consulado de mercaderes



The ***Consulado de mercaderes*** was the Spanish merchant guild, founded in Seville, the sole port for Spain's overseas trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, until the official port was relocated to Cadiz, following the Treaty of Utrecht. In theory, the Consulado enjoyed virtual monopoly rights over goods shipped to America, in a regular and closely controlled Spanish treasure fleet, and handled much of the silver this trade generated.

A *consulado* was founded in Mexico City in 1594, controlled by peninsular wholesale merchants who dealt in long-distance trade and often married into local elite families with commercial ties. Their assets had to amount to at least 28,000 pesos. Although they were not supposed to deal in local retail trade, they often did some indirectly. They mainly lived in Mexico City and had positions on the city council or *cabildo*. A number of them were connected to the crown mint in the capital. They diversified the assets locally, investing in urban real estate. In the 18th century, as New Spain's economy boomed, *consulados* were established in the port of Veracruz and in Guadalajara, indicating increased trade and the expansion of the merchant elite. The *consulado* in late colonial Mexico had approximately 200 members, who divided themselves into two factions, the Basque and Montañés, even though some were from neither of these Iberian regions. American-born merchants came to be part of the *consulado* in the later colonial period, but a small number of peninsular merchants dominated. Goods were shipped from the Spanish port of Cádiz to Veracruz, but many of the goods were produced elsewhere in Europe.



## Importance of the *Consulado*

In the mid-16th century, all American trade from Spain was mandated to go through the city of Seville, and later, the nearby port of Cádiz. The *Casa de Contratación*, ("House of Trade"), registered ships and passengers bound for Spain's overseas territories, kept sea charts, collected taxes, and in general controlled the Indies trade. In order to survive and maintain an effective business, the *Casa de Contratación* worked in conjunction with the merchant guild *(Consulado)*, which in turn controlled goods shipped to America and was paid vast amounts of silver in return for its cooperation.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Effects of the *Consulado's* control

Since it controlled most of the trade in the Spanish colonies, and since the *Consulado* was linked to the branches in Mexico City and Lima (and in the 18th century, other ports as well), it was able to maintain its monopoly of Spanish trade and keep prices high in all the colonies, and even played a hand in royal politics. The *Consulado* effectively manipulated the government and the citizenry of both Spain and the Indies colonies, and grew richer and more powerful every day because of it.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
