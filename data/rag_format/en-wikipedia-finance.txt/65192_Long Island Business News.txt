## History

In 1953 newspaper reporter Arthur Hug and the husband-and-wife team of Peg and John Whitmore launched *Long Island Commercial Review*. Hug had been a reporter at the *Nassau Daily Review-Star*, the leading newspaper on Long Island in the 1930s. Several years later, he accepted an offer to write for *Newsday*. Hug also served as a copy editor for *World Telegram & Sun* shortly before it folded.

The Hug and Whitmore team published the first paper on September 14, 1953. An issue sold for 15 cents, and a yearly subscription cost $5. The *Commercial Review* was known as the official publication of the Long Island Association, but it always remained independent.

In July of 2023, Long Island Business News won nine top journalism awards from the Press Club of Long Island and the Fair Media Council.
