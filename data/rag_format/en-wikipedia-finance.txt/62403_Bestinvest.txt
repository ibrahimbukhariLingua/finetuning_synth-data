## History

The company was founded in 1986 by John Spiers.

The company promoted the use of online fund supermarkets and established a Discretionary Investment Management arm. In July 2007 it was bought by management and 3i. The company acquired HW Financial Services, the financial services arm of Haines Watts the accountancy group, in January 2010.

In November 2013, Bestinvest received the backing of private equity firm Permira.

In February 2014, Permira agreed to buy the investment manager Tilney from Deutsche Bank with the ambition of creating a wealth manager with 9Â billion of assets. After completion of the deal in May 2014 Bestinvest and Tilney combined to create Tilney Bestinvest. Bestinvest remained as a separate brand focusing on execution-only investing whilst Tilney was introduced as a brand focusing on Investment Management and Financial Planning.

In June 2022, following Tilney's merger with Smith & Williamson, the group rebranded to Evelyn Partners. Bestinvest was retained as a separate brand.
