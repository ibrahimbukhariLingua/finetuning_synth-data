## History

In 1977, Robert Allgeier Sr. and *B-O-G Bremen Büro-Organisation-GmbH* founded Allgeier Computer GmbH, based in Bremen. This was followed in the 1980s by the founding of subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Great Britain and the United States.

On May 19, 1998, the former GmbH changed its name to Allgeier Computer AG. With effect from December 16 of the same year, the founding company and sole shareholder B-O-G Bremen Büro-Organisation-GmbH merged with Allgeier Computer AG. The shares previously held by the company were transferred to the founder Robert Allgeier senior.

Allgeier Computer AG went public on July 11, 2000. In 2002, the headquarters were moved to Munich and the company was renamed Allgeier Holding AG in 2003.

Following a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting of the company on June 21, 2011, and with effect from May 3, 2012, the company was converted into a European Company (SE) and has since been traded as Allgeier SE.

On December 15, 2020, the global software development business bundled in Nagarro SE was fully spun off and has since been operated as an independent company listed on the stock exchange.
