Ministry of the Treasury


# Ministry of the Treasury



The **Ministry of the Treasury** (大蔵省, *Ōkura-shō*, lit. 'the department of the great treasury') was a division of the eighth-century Japanese government of the Imperial Court in Kyoto, instituted in the Asuka period and formalized during the Heian period. The Ministry was replaced in the Meiji period.


## Overview

The nature of the ministry was modified in response to changing times. The ambit of the Ministry's activities encompasses, for example:

* administration of public accounts
* oversight of tax collections and of offerings to the Emperor
* regulation of weights and measures
* control of the functuations in prices of commodities
* regulation and oversight of the coinage of gold, silver, copper, and iron money
* maintenance of the lists of artisans engaged in coinage-related activities
* regulation of activities in the manufacture of lacquer ware, weaving, and other kinds of industries

## History

The duties, responsibilities and focus of the ministry evolved over time. It was established as part of the Taika Reforms and *Ritsuryō* laws. Since 1885, *Ōkura-shō* has been construed in reference to the Ministry of Finance, also called the *Ōkura no Tsukasa.*
