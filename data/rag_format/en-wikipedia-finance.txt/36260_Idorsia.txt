Idorsia


# Idorsia



**Idorsia** is a Swiss pharmaceutical research company in Allschwil, near Basel, Switzerland.


## History

After Actelion was bought by Johnson & Johnson in 2017, Idorsia was spun out into a new company and started operating on the same campus where Actelion was founded under the leadership of Actelion founders Jean-Paul Clozel as CEO and Martine Clozel as CSO. The company expects to be profitable in 2025.

In July 2023 due to a disappointing sales ramp-up of the recently approved sleep drug daridorexant, coupled with disappointing trial results in both clazosentan and lucerestat, Idorsia announced layoffs of up to five hundred staff of its one thousand two hundred total employees, to reduce cash burn at its Swiss headquarters by fifty percent. The main shareholder Jean-Paul Clozel provided Idorsia with a private loan of CHF 75 Mio.

In the same month, Idorsia sold its operating businesses in Japan and South Korea to the Japanese firm Sosei Heptares for CHF 400 million. This includes the rights to market clazosentan (Piviaz) and daridorexant (Quviviq) in the Asia Pacific region excluding China, plus rights on two other treatments and up to five clinical-stage programs in Idorsia's pipeline.
