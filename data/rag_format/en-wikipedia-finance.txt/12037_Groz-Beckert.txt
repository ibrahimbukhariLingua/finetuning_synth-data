## History

In 1852 Theodor Groz opened a store for toys and fashion accessories with an attached needle workshop in Ebingen, today part of Albstadt. In the same year he produced needles for warp knitting and hosiery production for the first time. In 1871 Ernst Beckert founded the identically named company "Ernst Beckert" in Eibenberg, near Chemnitz, for the production of needles. In 1884 Ernst Beckert relocated his needle factory to Chemnitz.
Already in 1888 Theodor Groz & Söhne founded their own health insurance fund for their employees – the precursor of today's BKK Groz-Beckert.
In 1937 the two companies merged, laying the foundation of the present group of companies. At that time, Walther Groz was the Head of the executive board of the company. Today, besides the headquarters there are further production sites all over the world (Germany, Belgium, Czech Republic, Portugal, India, China, Vietnam, USA). Also sales affiliates can be found around the globe (Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Spain, Great Britain, Turkey, Mexico, USA, India, China, Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore).

From 1996 to 2018 the company was chaired by Dr. Thomas Lindner (\* 1951), a descendant of one of the founders. Since 2019 he has been Chairman of the Groz-Beckert Supervisory Board. Lindner was also President of the VDMA from 2010 to 2013.
