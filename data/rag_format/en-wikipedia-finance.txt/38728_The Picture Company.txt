## History


### Founding

The Picture Company was founded in 2014 by film veterans Andrew Rona and Alex Heineman. Rona is a former president at Silver Pictures and Rogue Pictures, and Heineman was an EVP at Silver Pictures.

The company began in 2014 with a first-look deal with StudioCanal. The company achieved its first theatrical releases with Jaume Collet-Serra's *The Commuter,* Albert Hughes' *Alpha*, and Sam Taylor-Johnson's *A Million Little Pieces*. StudioCanal would later go on to buy a minority stake in The Picture Company in 2023 and ink a new five-year overall deal with the company.
