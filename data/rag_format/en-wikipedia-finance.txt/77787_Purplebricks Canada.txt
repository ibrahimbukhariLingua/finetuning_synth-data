## Services

Clients have their home listed on Purplebricks.ca and Realtor.ca through a board’s MLS® system. Purplebricks employs local Realtors who know the local real estate market. These Realtors provide clients with a home evaluation that includes pricing recommendations based on current market analysis of their local area. Clients pay a fee to list their home with Purplebricks rather than a commission based on the home’s value. The fee includes photography, a home listing on Realtor.ca and Purplebricks.ca, full-time customer support, and selling advice from a local Realtor. Clients also have a Realtor to handle offers, negotiations and paperwork, and the company manages booking showings.

Purplebricks offers a cash back Home Buying service to help clients find a home with the help of local Realtors who specialize in the field. They help the client find homes that match their criteria. Once a home is chosen, the Realtor helps the clients decide on an offer amount, handle the negotiations, navigate multiple offer situations, and finalize the deal.
