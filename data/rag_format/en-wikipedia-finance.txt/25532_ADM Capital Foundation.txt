## Background


### History

ADM Capital was established in 2006. That year, it was approached by M’Lop Tapang, a Cambodian organization working with children, to help secure funding for a permanent day centre. This became a first project for the foundation, which purchased land in Sihanoukville and built the day centre for M'Lop Tapang. This was also established to help poverty challenged children access health care and school. Other impact-driven environmental programs followed. Climate and biodiversity are umbrella themes for AMCF.

The foundation had 10 employees and controlled U$1.7 billion in 2012. The organisation Giving Evidence analysed 10 years of conducted a study of the funding that ADM Capital Foundation had issued in its initial 10 years. Released in 2017, the review concluded that there was no correlation between the outcome and the amount of money given.
