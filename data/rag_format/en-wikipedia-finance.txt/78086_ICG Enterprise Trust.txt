## History

The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1981 as an investment trust specialising in providing venture capital for unquoted companies mainly in Europe and the US. After personal equity plans ('PEP's) were introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson in 1987, the company was one of only three investment trusts, and the only one specialising in venture capital to feature in the PEP performance leagues. The company developed a strong reputation for investment performance and was the UK's best performing investment trust between 1992 and 1997.

It was managed by F&C Asset Management as F&C Enterprise Trust plc until May 2001, then by Graphite Capital as Graphite Enterprise Trust plc until February 2016, and then by Intermediate Capital Group as ICG Enterprise Trust since then.

The chair is Jane Tufnell.
