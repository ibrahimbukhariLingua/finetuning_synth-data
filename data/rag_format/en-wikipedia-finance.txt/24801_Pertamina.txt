Pertamina


# Pertamina



**PT Pertamina (Persero)** is an Indonesian state-owned oil and natural gas corporation, headquartered in Jakarta. It was created in August 1968 by the merger of *Pertamin* (established 1961) and *Permina* (established in 1957). In 2020, the firm was the third-largest crude oil producer in Indonesia behind US-based companies ExxonMobil's Mobil Cepu Ltd and Chevron Pacific Indonesia. According to the 2020 *Fortune Global 500* list, Pertamina is the largest company in Indonesia.


## History


### Nationalization

In 1957, Royal Dutch/Shell's assets in Indonesia (trading as Bataafse Petroleum Maatschappij) were nationalised, from which **Permina** was founded as a state-owned oil monopoly, headed by Lieutenant-General Ibnu Sutowo. Sutowo's position as the second deputy of Abdul Haris Nasution was the beginning of the armed forces' involvement in the oil industry. Permina distributed oil for the entire archipelago.

Permina founded the Apprentice Technical School (*Sekolah Kader Teknik*) in Brandan to train and produce experts in the field. In 1962, the company went on to establish the Oil Academy in Bandung. The academy's curriculum covered the technical aspects of the petroleum industry, and the graduates became the main source of labor for Permina (which was renamed Pertamin in 1961).

In 1960, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly adopted a policy that oil and gas extraction could only be carried out by the state, through a state-administered company. Pertamin was responsible for the administration, management and controlling of the exploration and production. The policy was short-lived. An agreement between the state and foreign companies was affirmed that gradually, oil refinery manufactures and other assets in marketing and distribution were to be sold to Indonesia within five to fifteen years.

In 1968, to consolidate the oil and gas industry for its management, exploration, marketing and distribution, Permina and Pertamin merged and became PN. Pertamina. It continued to do little drilling itself but made production-sharing agreements with foreign companies.


### The 1970s

After the merger, Pertamina's production rose considerably (about 15% each in 1968 and 1969, and nearly 20% in 1973). By the end of 1973, it produced 28.2% of Indonesia's oil, with agreements of Caltex and Stanvac to produce the rest (67.8% and 3.6%, respectively). Its assets included seven refineries, oil terminals, 116 tankers, 102 other vessels and an airline. It was also active in cement, fertiliser, liquid natural gas, steel, hospitals, real estate, a rice estate, and telecommunications.

The 1974 oil price increases produced revenues of USD 4.2 billion in that year, equivalent to approximately one-sixth of Indonesia's gross domestic product. Much of this revenue was used by Sutowo to expand Pertamina's interests far beyond oil production to include investments in oil tankers, steel and construction. Pertamina built the Bina Graha, the presidential executive office building in Jakarta. The global oil crisis of the 1970s greatly increased oil prices and thus Pertamina's profits. The company initially provided a fiscal lift to the hopes of Indonesia's development planners.

For President Suharto and other members of the ruling elite, revenue from Pertamina was "an ongoing source of funding" without accountability. "They ran this cash-cow into the ground, using it for both military and personal ends." Historian Adrian Vickers describes the endemic corruption at Pertamina:

> "At each stage of the transaction chain, somebody was getting a percentage... If accidents occurred, as in 1972 when eighty impoverished people died... they could be covered up."

In 1973, the government's ability to borrow money from overseas was constrained, and Pertamina was no longer providing revenues to the state. Instead, the massive enterprise turned out not to be making money but accumulating losses. In February 1975, Pertamina could no longer pay its American and Canadian creditors. An investigation followed, which revealed over US$10 billion in debts, mismanagement, and corruption within the company. This debt was equivalent to approximately thirty per cent of Indonesia's GNP at the time. Others offer a figure of a $15 billion debt. A public investigation damaged the reputation of the national elite both among Indonesians and foreigners.

However, charges against Ibnu Sutowo were dismissed and he and his family remained among the richest and most powerful in Indonesia, into the 21st century. The government took over the operation of the company and sought means by which to repay its debts. Pertamina's debt problems were eventually solved through a large government bail-out, which nearly doubled Indonesia's foreign debt.


### Since the 1980s

Human rights observers have long expressed concerns about Indonesia's hostility to labour unions. According to the *Multinational Monitor:* "In 1985, the government ordered the firing of over 1,600 workers at Pertamina and foreign oil companies, charging that they had been members of the Indonesian Communist Party, which had been permanently banned 19 years earlier when Suharto took power."

To execute a clause in the 2001 Oil and Natural Gas Act, in 2003 Pertamina legally became PT PERTAMINA (Persero), as per the enactment of Government Regulation No.31/2003. Pertamina is now under the coordinator of the State Minister of State-owned Enterprises.

Like other contractors, Pertamina holds a Cooperation Contract with the Oil and Gas Regulatory Body. With its transformation into a limited company, Pertamina has become a business entity with the main target of making a profit.


### Pertamina grafts scandal

In June 2024, Karen Agustiawan, Pertamina's president director from 2009 to 2014, was sentenced by the Jakarta Corruption Court to nine years in prison for graft, surrounding the procurement of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Cheniere Energy. News agency Antara estimates the that purchase contract resulted in state losses of Rp1.7 trillion (US$113.84 million). In August 2024, the conviction was upheld by the Jakarta High Court.

Other executives, including Yenni Andayani and Hari Karyuliarto, are also implicated and under investigation for their involvement in decisions that led to substantial financial losses. Luhur Budi Djatmiko, another former executive, faces scrutiny related to a separate corruption case involving a land purchase in South Jakarta that caused the state a loss of Rp348 billion.


## President directors

During the 1970s, until 1976, the president director of Pertamina was Ibnu Sutowo, a well-known figure in Indonesia. Since then, there have been a number of president directors. Recent president directors have included the following:

| No | Name | Term of office | | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start | End |
| 1 | Soegijanto | 1996 | 1998 |
| 2 | Martiono Hadianto | 1998 | 2000 | Before his appointment as president director of Pertamina, Martiono was briefly Finance Director of the state-owned airline company Garuda Indonesia |
| 3 | Baihaki Hakim | 2000 | 2003 | Baihaki was formerly president of Chevron Texaco's subsidiary in Indonesia PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia. He was appointed as president director of Pertamina by the president Abdurrahman Wahid in 2000. Subsequent to his resignation in 2003, there was controversy surrounding decisions taken in Pertamina during his period as president director concerning the purchase of giant tankers for the transport of oil. |
| 4 | Ariffi Nawawi | 2003 | 2004 |
| 5 | Widya Purnama | 2004 | 2006 | Widya Purnama was appointed from outside of the energy sector, formerly having been president (since 2002) of the Indonesian telecommunications company PT Indosat. |
| 6 | Ari Hernanto Soemarno | 2006 | 2009 |
| 7 | Karen Agustiawan | 2009 | 2014 | In February 2009 it was announced that Karen Agustiawan would become president director of Pertamina for a five-year term. Her appointment was extended in 2013. She resigned for unannounced reasons in August 2014. It was said at the time that she had plans to teach in Harvard University in the United States. |
| 8 | Dwi Soetjipto | 2014 | 2017 | In November 2014, the new president of Indonesia Joko Widodo announced a major reorganisation of the board of Pertamina as part of a series of reform measures for the energy sector. A new president director, Dwi Soetjipto, was appointed along with a number of new members to the board. The appointment of Dwi Soetjipto, previously president director of the major state-owned cement firm PT Semen Indonesia, attracted media attention because unlike most previous president directors of Pertamina, he had little previous experience in the oil sector. |
| 9 | Elia Massa Manik | 2017 | 2018 | In March 2017, after Soetjipto was dismissed due to leadership issues, the Board appointed Manik who had served as president director of Elnusa, a Pertamina subsidiary, from 2011 to 2014. He then spent a period as the CEO of PT Perkebunan Nusantara (PTPN) III, the holding company of 14 state-owned agriculture firms. |
| 10 | Nicke Widyawati | 2018 | 2024 | In late August 2018, it was announced that president Jokowi had decided that Nicke Widyawati, who had been acting president director since March, would be confirmed in the position of head of Pertamina. The decision was announced at a press conference in the Ministry for State-Owned Enterprises on 29 August. |
| 11 | Simon Aloysius Mantiri | 2024 | *present* | Appointed by Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, under the Presidency of Prabowo Subianto, after briefly served as President Commissioner, when he was tapped to replace Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who resigned from the post during the last stages of the Presidency of Joko Widodo, before the 2024 Indonesian general election. |


## Facilities


### Refineries

Pertamina has not built any new refineries since the Balongan refinery was opened in West Java in the mid-1990s.

PTT Public Company Limited and Pertamina signed into partnership to build a new petrochemical complex in Indonesia for an estimated cost of US $4 to 5 billion.

As of 2013, Pertamina operates six oil refineries which have a total combined capacity of around 1 million barrels (160 thousand cubic metres) of oil per day:

Pertamina: Refineries in Indonesia
| No | Refinery Unit (RU) | Unit | Province | Capacity (10³ bbl/d) | Capacity (10³ m³/d) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | RU II | Dumai | Riau | 127 | 20.2 |
| 2 | RU III | Plaju (Musi) | South Sumatra | 127 | 20.2 |
| 3 | RU IV | Cilacap | Central Java | 348 | 55.3 |
| 4 | RU V | Balikpapan | East Kalimantan | 260 | 41 |
| 5 | RU VI | Balongan | West Java | 125 | 19.9 |
| 6 | RU VII | Kasim | West Papua | 10 | 1.6 |
| **Total** | 997 | 159 |

(**Note:** By world standards, none of Indonesia's refineries are large. The world's largest refinery, at Jamnagar in India, has a production capacity of over 1,200,000 barrels (190,000 cubic metres) per day. As a rule of thumb, refineries need to produce at least 200,000 bbl (32,000 m³) per day to reach reasonable international standards of efficiency.)

There are several other refineries in Indonesia which Pertamina has responsibilities for:

Other Refineries in Indonesia
| No | Unit | Province | Capacity (10³ bbl/d) | Capacity (10³ m³/d) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Sei Pakning | Riau | 50 | 7.9 |
| 2 | Cepu | Central Java | 4 | 0.64 |
| 3 | Tuban (TPPI) | East Java | 100 | 16 |

In addition to the refineries which Pertamina owns, Pertamina has invested in two operating companies that manage output from LNG plants.

* PT Badak LNG operates a plant in Bontang, East Kalimantan, with 8 trains having a total capacity of 22.5 million tons per annum.
* PT Donggi Senoro LNG in Uso Village, Batui Subdistrict, Banggai Regency, Central Sulawesi Province, with 1 train with a capacity of 2 million tons per annum.

Pertamina also invested in the PT Arun 6 LNG trains near Lhokseumawe, Aceh, which had a total capacity of 12.5 million tons per annum. They closed down due to a lack of feed gas in 2014, and now Arun has used an LNG import terminal.

During 2012 and early 2013, it was announced several times that there were plans to build two more large fuel refineries, each with a capacity of around 300,000 barrels (48,000 cubic metres) per day, perhaps in Balongan, West Java (or, alternatively, in Bontang, East Kalimantan) and in Tuban, East Java. The first facility was planned to be built by Pertamina in partnership with Kuwait Petroleum, while the second was expected to be built by Pertamina in co-operation with Saudi Aramco. Total investment was expected to be around $20 billion. One main problem holding up an agreement to build the refineries was the issue of financial concessions to be provided for the foreign investors. Eventually, in September 2013 it was announced that the plans for the first refinery had been cancelled. At the same time, the government said that there were plans for yet a different refinery project which would be constructed solely by Pertamina and funded by the state. The crude oil for this alternative project was expected to be supplied from Iraq. Pending further progress on these large investment plans, Pertamina has announced (late 2014) plans to upgrade the existing refineries so as to add around 500,000 bbl (79,000 m³) per day to Pertamina's current refining capacity of around 1 million bbl (160 thousand m³) per day.

Pertamina also has two gas reserves and a petrochemical company. Pertamina's products include a great variety of fuels, chemicals, additives, and retail products.
