# Winklevoss Capital Management



**Winklevoss Capital** is a family office founded in 2012 by Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. The firm invests across multiple asset classes including seed funding and infrastructure to early-stage startups. The company is headquartered in New York's Flatiron District.


## Cryptocurrencies

On April 11, 2013, Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss revealed ownership of approximately 1% of bitcoins in circulation, worth about $11 million, via Winklevoss Capital. The brothers began buying bitcoin when the value of a single coin was in the single digits.

On July 1, 2013, Digital Asset Services, LLC (wholly owned by Winklevoss Capital) filed a Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund for bitcoin.

In 2013, Winklevoss also led a funding round for BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange start-up based in New York City. Winklevoss Capital, along with other investors, raised $1.5 million in seed funding to help BitInstant increase its staff and scale up its product. Since then, Winklevoss Capital has invested in a number of early-stage equity companies and token networks in the cryptocurrency space.

In 2014, Winklevoss Capital invested in Protocol Labs. The firm also participated in the fundraising for Filecoin in 2017.

## Medical cannabis

After the new Eaze CEO was named, the firm backed out of the deal and in May 2016 was sued in Delaware court for reneging on the deal. Winklevoss is also an investor in Eaze and participated in its Series B financing round in 2016.
