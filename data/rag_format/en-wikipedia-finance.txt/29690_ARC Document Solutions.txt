## History

The company began in 1988 as Micro Device, dba "Ford Graphics", a $9 million, privately held Los Angeles-based reprographics company, acquired and managed by ARC's two founders, K. "Suri" Suriyakumar and S. "Mohan" Chandramohan. Following four acquisitions in California, the company was organized as "American Reprographics Company, L.L.C.", a California Limited Liability Corporation, in 1997. Acquired operations generally maintained their original brands in the marketplace to retain local recognition.ⁿᵒⁿ-ᵖʳⁱᵐᵃʳʸ ˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
