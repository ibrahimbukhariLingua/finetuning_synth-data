# Beijing Stock Exchange



The **Beijing Stock Exchange** (**BSE**; Chinese: 北京证券交易所) is a stock exchange based in Beijing, China. It is one of the three stock exchanges operating independently of each other in mainland China, the others being the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.


## History

The Beijing municipal government had lobbied for years to upgrade the National Equities Exchange and Quotations (NEEQ) exchange (nicknamed "The New Third Board" (新三板)) to act as a home for US-listed Chinese firms.

On 2 September 2021, Xi Jinping announced the establishment of the Beijing Stock Exchange (BSE). The purpose was to help serve small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China.

This was accomplished by reforming the NEEQ exchange and establishing up the BSE as the primary platform for SMEs. As of 2020, the NEEQ exchange had almost 6,000 companies listed, with most of them being SMEs.

On 3 September 2021, Beijing Stock Exchange Co., Ltd. completed its business registration as a company. The registration information showed that NEEQ was the sole shareholder, making it the owner of the BSE. The registered capital was RMB 1 billion, and the registered address was the same as NEEQ's.

On 17 September 2021, the BSE issued guidelines on the qualifying criteria for investors.

On 30 October 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission published rules for the exchange regarding initial public offerings (IPO), refinancing, and supervision.

On 15 November 2021, trading on the BSE commenced. 81 companies debuted trading on the exchange that day: 71 were transferred from the "Select tier" of the NEEQ exchange, while the remaining 10 held their trading debuts.
