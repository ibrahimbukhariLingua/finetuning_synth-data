## Early life

Gokongwei was born in Manila as the second of six children. His father, John Gokongwei, established JG Summit Holdings Inc., while his mother, Elizabeth, was a founding member of Robinsons Department Store. He went to Xavier School until the second year of high school. He then finished his last two years of high school in Singapore.

In 1988, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a double degree in Finance and Applied Science (*summa cum laude*).


## Business career

Gokongwei began his career joining the family business as a management trainee at Universal Robina Corporation (URC). He sold Jack ’n Jill snacks to supermarkets, groceries, and sari-sari stores.


### Universal Robina

In the late 1990s, Gokongwei became general manager of URC's branded food business, where he led the development of beverages. In 2004, the company introduced C2, a ready-to-drink tea that went head-to-head with foreign cola companies that dominated the beverage sector in the Philippines. It was so successful that another production line was required to meet demand.

In 2013, Gokongwei became chief executive of URC. The following year, he partnered with Japan's Calbee and France's Danone for potato chips and beverages, respectively. He also acquired New Zealand-based cookie maker Griffin's Foods for 700 million New Zealand dollars ($609 million at the time), giving Universal Robina a presence in the South Pacific. The partnership with Calbee, ended five years later as Calbee suffered losses in the Philippine market.

In 2021, URC bought Malaysia's Munchy Food Industries for 1.9 billion ringgit ($454 million) to become the nation's leading biscuits manufacturer.


### Cebu Pacific Air

In 1996, Gokongwei was tasked by his father to take on the challenge of building a new low-cost airline, Cebu Pacific Air. In February 1998, two years after the company's inception, Cebu Pacific Flight 387 crashed into a mountainside, killing all 104 people aboard. At the time, it was the nation's worst air disaster.

In 2010, Cebu Pacific became the Philippines largest airline.

In December 2022, Gokongwei announced his resignation as president and CEO of Cebu Pacific.

Earlier in the year, Gokongwei joined five other businessmen in a consortium that proposed to revamp Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport by spending 267 billion pesos. The government rejected the bid in July.
