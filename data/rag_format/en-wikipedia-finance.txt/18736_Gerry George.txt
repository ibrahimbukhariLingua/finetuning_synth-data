## Research and editorship

George was chief-editor of the *Academy of Management Journal*, the leading journal in management and business research from 2013 until 2016. This was the first time that the editorship moved to Europe and then to Asia in the journal's 60-year history. In his editor role, he encouraged a rethinking of management scholarship to embrace important organizational and social phenomena rather than an exclusive focus on theory development in order to improve the applicability of management research. His editorials called for researchers to explore grand challenges for management including applications in climate change, aging populations, digital money, design thinking, and big data among others. He is an active advocate of "impact" of management research for policy and practice, especially with a focus on Sustainable Development Goals and positive societal outcomes.

Gerard George has numerous academic papers to his credit on the topics of internationalisation and entrepreneurship, patenting and licensing, open innovation, design, and business models. His work addresses social inclusion and growth through innovation in business models and governance in the context of rural electrification and micro-enterprise development in Africa. He is probably best known for his widely cited co-authored paper on absorptive capacity of firms with Professor Shaker Zahra. Another contribution is on the performance consequences of slack in private firms. He found evidence for the "less is more" philosophy or that 'resource constraints' improves financial performance in small and medium-sized enterprises. George has several books to his credit. 'Inventing Entrepreneurs' focuses on scientists in academic and corporate environments who pursue entrepreneurial careers. 'Models of Opportunity' looks at the business model of growing businesses and how visionary entrepreneurs use narratives of change and aspiration. His recent books include 'The Handbook of Inclusive Innovation', 'The Business Model Book', and 'Managing Natural Resources'.
