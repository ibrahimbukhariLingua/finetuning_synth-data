## History

ARM was founded by Patrice Motsepe as South Africa's first black-owned mining company. Motsepe founded ARMGold in 1997, which went on to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in 2002.

In 2003 ARMGold entered a merger with Harmony Gold Mining and Anglovaal, previously owned by Richard and Brian Menell, and became the largest group controlled by black entrepreneurs. The 2003 ARMGold merger with Harmony Gold Mining formed the world’s 5th largest gold producer. The ARMGold merger with Anglovaal Mining (Avmin) came after.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2009, ARM joined the International Council on Mining and Metals. In 2009, ARM was reported to be planning $1.12 billion investments in mining in Zimbabwe. In August 2010, ARM entered a $380 million joint venture with Vale to build a copper mine in Zambia, which was expected to produce 100,000 tons of copper. In February 2016, ARM put a further $148 million bail out in place to preserve their broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) status. In March 2016, ARM reported that profits had been halved due to lower commodity prices. ARM also has had a 50% stake in Morobe Mining Joint Ventures (MMJV) of Papua New Guinea. MMJV has operations in Hidden Valley and Wafi-Golpu in Morobe Province approximately 50 kilometers south-west of Lae, Papua New Guinea.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
