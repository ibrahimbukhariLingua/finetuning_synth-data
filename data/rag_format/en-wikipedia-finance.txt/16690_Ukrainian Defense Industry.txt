Ukrainian Defense Industry


# Ukrainian Defense Industry



**Ukrainian Defense Industry**, also operating as **Ukroboronprom State Concern**, is an association of multi-product enterprises (conglomerate or concern) in various sectors of the defence industry of Ukraine. The company has ceased most of its activities within Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and has relocated much of its production abroad during the war.

The concern includes enterprises that operate in the development, manufacture, sale, repair, modernization and disposal of weapons, military and special equipment and ammunition, and participating in military-technical cooperation with foreign states.

In 2021, Ukroboronprom was under state reform and was expected to cease to exist and reform into main two holdings of Defence Holding and Aerospace Holding.ⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

"Ukroboronprom" was created by the decrees of the President of Ukraine in 2010 (12 September, No. 1085/2010 and 28 December, No. 1245/2010) with additional decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers of 29.12.2010 No. 1221 and 31.08.2011 No. 993.

The main goal of "Ukroboronprom" is the efficientᵃᶜᶜᵒʳᵈⁱⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ʷʰᵒᵐ? management of Ukrainian military industrial sector and improvement of the effectiveness of the enterprises that are parts of State Concern.

In September 2013, five divisions were created for the organizational structure of Ukroboronprom: aircraft industry and aircraft maintenance; precision weaponry and munition; armoured vehicles, automotive equipment, engineering and special equipment; shipbuilding and marine facilities; radar, radio communications and air defense systems.

As separate divisions stand those,ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ that are authorized to conduct import/export operations with military equipment and wares that hold National Security information. These enterprises conduct international sales of equipment produced by Ukrainian military industrial sector and post-sales service of equipment, maintenance, and modernization.

Roman Romanov, a graduate of the International Institute of Management (MiM-Kyiv), headed "Ukroboronprom" since 4 June 2014. As a result of his activity, "Ukroboronprom" finally became profitable by the end of 2014.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

At the end-year 2014 "Ukroboronprom" fulfilled all government contracts by 100%. During the second half of the year 2014, the enterprises of the Concern created more than 2000 jobs and 13 more enterprises became profitable. Moreover, over the second half of the year wage arrears to employees totaling to ₴45 million were overtaken.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In August 2016, "Ukroboronprom" signed a memorandum of cooperation with the former head of the Agency for Defence Advanced Research Projects (DARPA) Anthony Tetter. He became an advisor on the long-term development of "Ukroboronprom".

"Ukroboronprom" was the first among Ukrainian industrial giants to launch a system of e-procurement. Its official start was in October 2014. The concern claims they saved US$304.8 million in 2015, and in 2016 – ₴476.6 million.

Ukroboronprom increased its production and began to provide Ukraine's Armed Forces with modernized weaponry. In 2017, Ukroboronprom completed the State Defence Order and conveyed 3,673 units of weapons and equipment to the security agencies of the country, including 2,053 new and upgraded ones.

For 2014–2017, Ukroboronprom rose by 14 positions – from 91 to 77th place – in the SIPRI world ranking of arms manufacturers.

Ukroboronprom together with the American company Delphi Corporation has launched a new enterprise "Electric Systems". It has become the official supplier of components for Mercedes products.

The Cyber Guard project from Ukroboronprom became the general partner of the cyberforum HackIT-2017. The event was attended by co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak.

On 12 February 2018 Roman Romanov resigned and was replaced on 21 February 2018 when the President of Ukraine appointed Pavlo Bukin as Director General. Aivaras Abromavičius succeeded him on 31 August 2019. Abromavičius was succeeded by Ihor Fomenko on 6 October 2020. Yuriy Husev was placed as General Director in December 2020.


### Russian invasion

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukroboronprom Concern repaired and maintained both Ukrainian vehicles and captured Russian vehicles. It offered US$1,000,000 to Russian pilots for every combat-capable aircraft handed over to them as well as $500,000 for every combat-capable helicopter handed over.

On 6 March 6, 2022, Ukroboronprom Concern's Zhytomyr Armour Plant was destroyed, with three people being killed. On April 15, the Ukroboronprom Concern Vizar Plant was struck with several sea-based long-range missiles. The plant produced R-360 Neptune cruise missiles for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and is believed that the strike was reprisal for the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva by two Neptune missiles.

On 20 September, it was announced that Ukroboronprom Concern and an unspecified NATO member country were to build a factory for the production of ammunition that will be held to NATO standards.

On 17 October, following the October 2022 Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian targets, Ukroboronprom Concern and the Come Back Alive Foundation independently announced the preparations of a weapon that could "create explosions in Moscow" with a range of up to 1000 kilometres and equipped with a 75 kilogram warhead. It was later revealed that the weapon was an unmanned aerial vehicle and is rumored to be responsible for several attacks on Russian military infrastructure in Saratov, Ryazan, and Kursk.

On 15 March 2023, Ukroboronprom, with the help of a "NATO country", started manufacturing 125 mm smoothbore ammunition for Ukraine's Soviet era tanks outside of Ukraine. Along with existing production of 120 mm mortar rounds, 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells. A part of a larger effort by Ukraine to manufacture ammunition as Western donors feel the "pinch" in their own stockpiles. Ten employees have been killed thus far during the war. Production sites have had to be dispersed to avoid destruction. The company spokesperson said that "The emergence of this shell is the first product of our joint cooperation with a country from the (NATO) alliance. It will not end with shells, we will soon show you other products produced with partner countries,"

On 21 March 2023 the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine renamed *Ukroboronprom* to "Ukrainska oboronna promyslovist" (Ukrainian Defense Industry).

On 6 April, Ukroboronprom announced that it would start manufacturing 125mm tank rounds with Polish state defence company Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa. This agreement means that Poland will become the second NATO country helping Ukraine manufacture Soviet-era shells. The first is an unidentified Central European NATO member.

On 21 June, Ukroboronprom claimed to have built a drone with a 1000-km range. Whether used in an operation or just tested it was not clear. Ukraine said in autumn 2022 that the weapon it was developing would have a 75-kg warhead.

According to *European Pravda*, "Ukroboronprom" would be headed by Herman Smetanin from June 28, 2023.


## General background

The conglomerate was established in 2010 in place of the existing "Armoured Equipment of Ukraine" (1999) and "Technological Military Service".

The feasibility of combining in a single management structure of scientific, experimental, industrial enterprises and special exporters is supported by the positive effect,ᵃᶜᶜᵒʳᵈⁱⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ʷʰᵒᵐ? that the Concern has shown during its existence. Formation of Ukroboronprom made available organization of an innovation cycle "research – development – serial production – consumption (sales) – service – utilization".ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

To ensure optimal decision-making in different fields the State Concern uses a concept of divisional management structure. The concept was adopted taking into account current trends in theory and practice of management. Its essence is to separate strategic and operational objectives from industry operational problems management. A divisional principle is to provide administrative and economic "autonomy" of industries, a delegation of administrative powers of heads of divisions.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Initially it consisted of seven major state companies:ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

* Ukrspetsexport
* Spetstechnoexport
* Ukroboronservice
* Progress
* Specialized Foreign-trade company "Prohres"
* Ukrinmash (headed in 2015–2016 by Leonid Kryuchkov)
* Promoboronexport
* Tasko-Export

In 2014 the conglomerate included 134 enterprises of the military–industrial complex of Ukraine and employed some 120,000 people. In 2012 eighteen of those companies were to be reorganized (Resolution #223, March 21, 2012). They included:

* Kharkiv Morozov Machine-Building Design Bureau
* Kharkiv Engine Building Design Bureau
* Ship Building Research Project Center
* Shostka State Factory "Zirka" (Star)
* Science Producing Complex "Iskra" (Spark)
* Chemical State Association of Petrovsky
* others

According to the company, China and India are a traditional market for Ukrainian military products. In 2013, the Brazilian Navy announced a potential partnership with Ukroboronprom.

In March 2014, after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the company barred all exports of weaponry and military equipment to Russia.


## Structure

State Concern consists of 134 military industry sector enterprises of Ukraine (123 state enterprises and 9 joint stock corporations, with the profits participation rights delegated to the management of "Ukroboronprom").

## Reforming strategy of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine

In 2016, "Ukroboronprom" developed a strategy for reforming military-industrial complex of Ukraine. It consists of five key initiatives: corporatization, clustering, audit, a platform of innovations, and technologies protection. In 2016, Aircraft Corporation has been already created on the basis of "Antonov". Four clusters are in the process of creation: armored vehicles, shipbuilding, high-precision weapon systems, radar, electronic warfare and communications. A technical task for an independent audit by leading international consulting and auditing companies was developed.

In May 2017, "Ukroboronprom" presented a new website presenting the strategy for reforming of the military-industrial complex of Ukraine – reformdefence.com. The site contains all important materials for each of the areas of strategy: corporatization, clustering, audit, technologies protection, and launch of the General Advanced Research and Development Agency (GARDA) that will be a platform to bring together developers, startups, investment funds, and military.

In November 2017, "Ukroboronprom" launched a new phase of reform – an international audit. A tender committee is formed to choose a consulting company. A Transparency International – Ukraine specialist is a member of the committee.
