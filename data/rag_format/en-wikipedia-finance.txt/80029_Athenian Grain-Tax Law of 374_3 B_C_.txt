Athenian Grain-Tax Law of 374/3 B.C.


# Athenian Grain-Tax Law of 374/3 B.C.



The **Athenian Grain-Tax Law of 374/3 B.C.** is an Athenian legislation passed somewhere between the years 374 and 373 B.C. which ordered the grain and barley imported from the islands of Lemnos, Imbros and Skyros to be transported at a specific time to Piraeus, from there brought up to the city, stored in the temple of Aiakos, and sold in the Agora by public officials newly appointed for the purpose. Furthermore, the law allocated the proceeds from the sale of that grain to the military fund.


## Origin

The legislation for the Grain-Tax Law was inscribed on a marble stele. This monument was found on July 21, 1986, by John Camp. The monument was found built into a repair of the east wall of the Great Drain where it passes the northeast corner of the Stoa Basileios. It is on this slab that the Athenian legislation is inscribed and although the slab itself has undergone some noticeable water damage and corrosion, the inscription is easily visible.


## Size

The stele measures as follows: Height, 1.105 m.; at molding, 0.45m., below molding (level of line 2), 0.422 m., at level of line 61, 0.437m., at bottom, 0.44m.; thickness, 0.115m. The letters measure as follows: Height, lines 1,3-61, 0.007m., line 2, 0.01m.
