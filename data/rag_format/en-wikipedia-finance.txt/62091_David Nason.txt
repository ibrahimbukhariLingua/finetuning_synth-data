## Government service


### Securities and Exchange Commission, 2002–2005

Before joining the Treasury Department, Nason spent three years as counsel to Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul S. Atkins. At the SEC, Nason assisted in implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including creation of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, corporate governance and listing requirements modifications, and financial accounting rules and policy. He advised the SEC on investment management matters and on securities offering reform. In addition, Nason managed all of the Enron enforcement actions for Commissioner Atkins.


### U.S. Treasury Department, 2005–2009

Nason joined the U.S. Department of the Treasury in October 2005 as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions. In March 2007, President George W. Bush nominated him for promotion to Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, and he was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

As a member of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson's senior team, Nason played a pivotal role in creating, developing and implementing the Treasury's response to the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. He co-developed the Capital Purchase Program of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which injected more than $200 billion into approximately 700 banks. Nason also spearheaded the creation of the Treasury's Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Mutual Funds, a $3 trillion insurance program that generated $1.2 billion in fees and incurred no losses. Early in his tenure, Nason led Treasury's financial regulatory reform efforts, including the publication of Treasury's Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure. Nason also played a leading role in the Treasury's efforts to enhance the regulation and supervision of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan banks.

At Treasury, Nason was known as a "mini-policy think tank," "pragmatic" and "one of the department's most important advisers."

Andrew Ross Sorkin's bestselling book *Too Big to Fail* (Viking 2009) says Nason was Treasury's "resident policy-making brain" who had been warning since 2007 that a Bear Stearns-like run on one or more banks was likely. In his 2010 memoir *On the Brink,* Secretary Paulson says that Nason "had the most thorough knowledge of bank guarantees at either the Fed or Treasury," and describes the money market guarantee Nason helped design as "the single most powerful and important actions taken to hold the system together."
