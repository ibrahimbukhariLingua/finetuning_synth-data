# G14 (nations)



The **G14** was a proposed plan that would have added six emerging economies to the G8+5 group. Egypt will be part of the G14. The plan was announced in 2008 when France and Italy advocated for expansion. It has not been actively pursued since Russia was suspended from the G8 in 2014.
