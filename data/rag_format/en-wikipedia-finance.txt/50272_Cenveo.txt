Cenveo


# Cenveo



**Cenveo** is a company based in Stamford, Connecticut, United States. It is engaged in the manufacture of various print-related products. Founded in 1921 as Denver-based Rockmont Envelope, the company's products and services include printed labels, packaging and digital print products, print magazine and books, mailing and creative services, and inventory and warehouse management software.
In January 2018 Cenveo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy citing overwhelming debt to multiple lenders.


## History

Before changing its name to Cenveo, the company was known as Mail-Well, which was derived from Denver's Rockmont Envelope. After changing ownership several times and acquiring and divesting various label and packing operations, the company changed its name to Cenveo in 2004. Cenveo spent the next few years streamlining its product and service offerings, adding Cadmus Communications to its company lineup in 2007, which made Cenveo one of the "largest printing companies in North America." In 2017, Cenveo was awarded a two-year $61 million contract to produce letters, envelopes, and questionnaires for the 2020 U.S. Census, though the contract was terminated after Cenveo declared bankruptcy. In 2018, Robert Burton Sr. stepped down as CEO of Cenevo and his son, Robert Burton Jr. was announced as the new CEO.


## Acquisitions and partnerships

Under its new name and corporate identity, Cenveo first attempted to purchase Banta Corporation, a Wisconsin-based printing and supply chain management company, in August 2006. The $1.21 billion offer was turned down by Banta's then-chairperson and CEO Stephanie Streeter, who then sold the company months later to RR Donnelley for $1.3 billion.

After Cenveo successfully purchased Cadmus Communications in 2007, which gave Cenveo a stronger hold on the scientific and technical journal-printing market, it sought to add other companies to its expanding operations. Cenveo acquired Commercial Envelope and PC Ink, otherwise known as Printegra, also in 2007, which extended product and service offerings to the printed envelope, label and business form industry.

Cenveo focused next on purchasing companies to expand its commercial offerings, buying California-based Madison/Graham ColorGraphics and Rex Corp. in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

The company did not add another company to its growing list of acquisitions until 2009 when it purchased Nashua Corporation, which increased Cenveo's offerings in the specialty paper and pharmaceutical label industry.

Cenveo also made acquisitions in the publisher services segment by acquiring Glyph International (2010) and Nesbitt Graphics (2011), both full service book production companies.

In 2012, Cenveo sold its Forms and Business Documents Group to Ennis. In September 2013, Cenveo purchased the operating assets of its bankrupt competitor, National Envelope Corporation, for $25 million.

By the end of 2015, the Burton family will have received over $70 million in compensation from their Cenveo employment.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
