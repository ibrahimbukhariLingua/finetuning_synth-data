## Patent Case

In 2004, Xiao-i filed an application for an invention patent titled "A Chatbot System." The patent was officially granted authorization in 2009, numbered ZL200410053749.9.

In June 2012, Xiao-i contended that Apple Inc.'s integration of Siri in its iPhone 4S has infringed on its patented technology, falling within the scope of protection of its patent. Xiao-i then initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against Apple at the First Intermediate People’s Court of Shanghai. In November 2012, Apple filed an administrative review petition with the National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), requesting the invalidation of the patent. By September 2013, the Patent Reexamination Board of CNIPA decided to uphold the validity of the patent. Following the decision, in November of the same year, Apple brought an administrative lawsuit against the Patent Reexamination Board of CNIPA at the First Intermediate People's Court of Beijing, the court ruled in July 2014 to uphold the decision made by the Patent Reexamination Board maintaining the validity of the patent. Dissatisfied with the ruling, Apple appealed to the Beijing High People's Court.

In April 2015, the Beijing High People's Court declared the patent invalid. In May of the same year, Xiao-i appealed to the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China. In 2016, following the decision of the Beijing High People’s Court on the patent invalidity, the First Intermediate People’s Court of Shanghai dismissed Xiao-i’s lawsuit filed back in 2012.

On June 28, 2020, the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China rendered a verdict affirming the validity of Xiao-i’s patent. This marked the conclusion of an eight-year-long judicial proceedings initiated by Apple’s request to invalidate Xiao-i’s patent. The final outcomes affirmed and protected the patent in question.

In August 2020, Xiao-i again filed a lawsuit against Apple at the Shanghai High People's Court, alleging that Apple's Siri infringed its patent rights and sought RMB 10 billion (USD 1.4 billion) compensation from Apple. The case is currently under review, and information is subject to public disclosure.
