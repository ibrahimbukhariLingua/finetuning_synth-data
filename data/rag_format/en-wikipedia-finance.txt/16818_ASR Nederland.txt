ASR Nederland


# ASR Nederland



**ASR Nederland** is a major Dutch insurance group based in Utrecht. The company was created in its current form in 2008 when the insurance business was split out of Fortis, after it was acquired by the Dutch government during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The Dutch government revived the old name that had been used prior to the acquisition by Fortis in 2000 for the newly structured company.


## History

The original ASR insurance company was formed in 1997 after the merger of *Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen* (which dates back to 1720) and *ETI Amersfoortse* insurance companies. The new name ASR was based on a combination of initials of Amersfoort and Stad Rotterdam.

In 2000, Fortis acquired ASR insurance and merged it with its other insurance business to form **Fortis ASR**. At that time the other insurances business included the insurers *Amev*, *Ardanta* and *Falcon* (which included Interlloyd en VSB-leven).

In 2008 the insurance component became government owned when the Dutch Government took control of Fortis to prevent the bank and insurer from failing during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

On November 21, 2008, the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos announced that they would spin off Fortis Insurance Nederland NV using the revived name of **ASR Nederland NV**.

*Fortis Corporate Insurance* was sold separately and did not form part of ASR Nederland. The Belgium insurance business of Fortis was not part of this process and that business was split by the Belgium government to create the insurance company Ageas.


## Operations

ASR operates from four locations with a headquarters in Utrecht.
