## History

The company was founded in 1901 in Copenhagen, Denmark as a small security company with 20 night watchmen named **København-Frederiksberg Nattevagt** (English: *Copenhagen-Frederiksberg Night Watch*). The company expanded into the cleaning business with the establishment of **Det Danske Rengørings Selskab** (*The Danish Cleaning Company*) in 1934 as an independent subsidiary of the security company. It then expanded into Sweden in 1946 when a Swedish subsidiary established. The company adopted its current name, **International Service System**, in 1968.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

ISS expanded into Austria and Spain in 1971, at the same time that it acquired part of Servi Systems Oy. It began expanding overseas in 1973 and its global revenue surpassed 1 billion DKK in 1975.

In 1999 ISS acquired Abilis, the second largest European provider of cleaning and specialised services, in a DKK 3.6 billion acquisition, the Group’s largest ever. Abilis had about 50,000 employees and annual revenues of 5.2 billion DKK in 1998. The total number of employees in the Group reached 200,000 in 1999, doubling in just 10 years.
