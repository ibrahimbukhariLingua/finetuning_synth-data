Travix was established by a merger of CheapTickets (Beins Travel Group Ltd), Vliegwinkel, Flugladen, BudgetAir (Airtrade) and Vayama in January 2011. The oldest part of the company, Vliegwinkel.nl, was created by Airtrade in Haarlem and founded by Wim Butte and Andre Hesselink. Vliegwinkel.nl was the first online travel agency (OTA) in the Netherlands.

On October 4, 2018, international travel company BCD Group announced that it would take full ownership in Travix International BV after purchasing all outstanding shares from minority shareholder ING Corporate Investments.

In April 2020, the international OTA company Trip.com Group acquired Travix International BV.
