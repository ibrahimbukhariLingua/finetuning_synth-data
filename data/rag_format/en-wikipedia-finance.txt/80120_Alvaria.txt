## History

Aspect was founded under the name Aspect Communications in 1973, when its software powered the first call center flight booking system with an intelligent Automatic Call Distributor.

In 2005, Aspect Communications was acquired by Concerto Software for $1 billion, with the new entity called Aspect Software. Concerto was created in 2002 when Davox Corporation acquired CELLIT and renamed itself Concerto Software, Inc.

In 2006, Aspect borrowed $1.16 billion to finance its international expansion.

In 2006, Aspect opened its first office offshore in Bangalore, India.

In 2011, Aspect opened a facility in Ireland.

In 2012, Aspect had its credit rating lowered by Standard & Poor's because of the large amount of debt. In 2015, Moody's lowered its credit rating as well. In March 2016, Aspect filed for bankruptcy to reduce its debt load, and emerged from Chapter 11 in May 2016.

In 2012, most of the management was replaced with a new team led by Stewart Bloom. Over the next year, Aspect relocated its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona.

In 2016, Aspect released Via Customer Engagement Center, including various products from Aspect's portfolio.

In February 2019, Aspect was acquired by Vector Capital.
