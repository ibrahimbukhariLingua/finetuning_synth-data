## Overview

Taisei Corporation is one of the five so called Japanese "super general contractors" (スーパーゼネコン, *suupaa zenekon*), the other four being Kajima Corporation, Shimizu Corporation, Takenaka Corporation and Obayashi Corporation. Taisei Corporation has its roots in Okura zaibatsu (財閥) established by Baron Ōkura Kihachirō (大倉 喜八郎). Following the dissolution of the zaibatsu after World War II, Taisei was restructured as an employee-owned corporation and is currently the only employee-owned Japanese large scale general contractor among the "super general contractors"; the other four are owned and controlled by families.

Taisei has successfully constructed several civil and building projects including skyscrapers, dams, bridges, tunnels, subways as well as residential housing projects both in Japan and overseas. Taisei is also well known in Japan for its disaster resistant housing brand Palcon (パルコン).

Noted international projects where Taisei was involved include the expansion of the Palm Islands undersea tunnel in Dubai, the Bosphorus undersea tunnel in Turkey, the New Doha International Airport in Qatar, the Noi Bai International Airport Terminal 2 in Hanoi, the Mega Bridge in Thailand, the Cần Thơ Bridge in Vietnam and the Iloilo International Airport in Iloilo City, Philippines.
