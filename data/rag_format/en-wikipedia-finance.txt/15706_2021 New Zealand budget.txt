2021 New Zealand budget


# 2021 New Zealand budget



**Budget 2021** is the New Zealand budget for fiscal year 2021/22, presented to the House of Representatives by Finance Minister Grant Robertson on 20 May 2021 as the fourth budget presented by the Sixth Labour Government. This budget occurs after a year of several lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand and focuses on economic recovery.


## Background

The budget is for the fiscal year from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This is the fourth budget of the Sixth Labour Government and the first budget of Labour's second term in office, in which they have a parliamentary majority, making this the first budget where the Labour Party has been the sole party behind the creation of the budget.

The impact of COVID-19 on the economy has led to an increase in government borrowing, with government debt expected to hit NZ$166.2 billion by the end of the 2020/21 fiscal year; before the pandemic it was at $57.7 billion. The 2020/21 fiscal year ends with a forecasted budget deficit of $21.6 billion.

The operating allowance for this budget is $3.8 billion per year.

## Reactions

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated that the budget sets New Zealand up to recover from COVID-19 and have the country "[be] stronger than when [it] entered the pandemic", a statement echoed by Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni. Grant Robertson stated that "this is the biggest lift in benefits in more than a generation", criticising the 1991 budget.

Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson praised the budget for increasing benefits. Māori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer was "cautiously optimistic" about the budget, praising the government for "accept[ing] a need to take a targeted approach rather than a universal one".

National Party and Opposition leader Judith Collins said that the Government "lacks the plan and ambition" in this budget and that it does not offer "any direction for getting the country back on track to prosperity" and that it is "setting New Zealand up to fail". ACT leader David Seymour criticised the budget, saying it "ignore[s] reality" and does not have anything for middle-class New Zealanders.

Children's Commissioner Andrew Becroft praised the budget for being a "very solid, continuing step on our journey of halving child poverty by 2028", but said there was still more to be done.
Director of poverty group Council for International Development Josie Pagani says that the budget "deal[s] with some of the inequality", forecasting that this budget will lift 75 thousand children out of poverty, but did not see the changes as drastic.
Economic commentator Brad Olsen stated that the budget was "underwhelming" and did not have provisions for economic growth.
