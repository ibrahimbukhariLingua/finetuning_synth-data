## Products and services

Engie Australia provides electricity and gas to homes and businesses in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia.


## History

In 2005, the EA-IPR Retail Partnership was launched as a retail brand by International Power in a partnership with New South Wales state-owned enterprise EnergyAustralia, and the partnership operated in the electricity and gas retail and wholesale markets of Victoria and South Australia.

In August 2007, International Power completed a buy out of the partnership. Subsequently, International Power launched the retail brand as Simply Energy in those two states.

Between 2010 and 2012, International Power was progressively acquired by French company GDF Suez, with the French Government having control of the entity and its subsidiaries, including Simply Energy. GDF Suez changed its name to ENGIE in 2015. The Simply Energy brand was subsequently phased out in favour of its parent company's Engie branding about a decade later in 2024.


## Controversy

Simply Energy had been subject to many high profile complaints regarding the practices of their doorknockers and billing issues.


## Naming rights deal

Under a three-year naming rights deal since March 2024, Engie Australia secured the naming rights of the Sydney Showground Stadium, with the stadium renamed ENGIE Stadium.
