**Miller Pipeline**, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, is a natural gas distribution, water/wastewater, and transmission pipeline and utility contracting company. The company provides a range of pipeline contracting and rehabilitation services for natural gas, liquids, water and wastewater pipelines.
