Direct material total variance


# Direct material total variance



In variance analysis (accounting) **direct material total variance** is the difference between the actual cost of actual number of units produced and its budgeted cost in terms of material. Direct material total variance can be divided into two components:

* the direct material price variance,
* the direct material usage variance.

## Example

Let us assume that standard direct material cost of widget is as follows:

Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212 kg of unobtainium which cost $ 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material total variance can be calculated as:

| 100 units should have cost (× $ 120 per unit) | € 12,000 |
| --- | --- |
| but did cost | € 13,144 |
| Direct material total variance | **€ 1,144** | **(A)** |

Direct material total variance can be reconciled to direct material price variance and direct material usage variance by:

| Direct material usage variance | € 720 | (A) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct material price variance | € 424 | (A) |
| Direct material total variance | € 1,144 | (A) |

See direct material usage variance#Example and direct material price variance#Example for computations of both components.
