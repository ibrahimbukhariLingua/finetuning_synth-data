Treasury Casino


# Treasury Casino



The **Treasury Casino**, also simply known as **The Treasury** was a casino in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It also housed a hotel, 6 restaurants, 5 bars, and a nightclub. The casino was operated by Star Entertainment Group. It closed on the 25 August 2024 to make way for a new Star Casino at Queen's Wharf.

One percent of the casino's gross gaming revenue was deposited in the Jupiters Casino Community Benefit Fund. This fund supported non-profit community-based groups and is administered by the Government of Queensland.


## Origins

The casino and hotel occupied two heritage-listed buildings, the Treasury Building, and the nearby Lands Administration Building. The buildings are separated by Queens Gardens. A 700-vehicle car park is located beneath the park.


## Architecture and refurbishment

An early 19th century building with Edwardian-Baroque exterior designs and ornate colonnades, striking sandstone walls and six-story atrium, the historic Treasury Building houses a three-level gaming emporium of 80 gaming tables and over 1,300 gaming machines, and was opened refurbished as the Treasury Casino in April 1995. The hotel section of the Conrad Treasury Casino is housed in the former Lands Administration Building.

There are also function rooms, ranging from early 19th century decor to modern business meeting rooms.


## Gaming

The Treasury Casino offered a number of gambling games including: Blackjack, Treasury 21 (a variant of Spanish 21), mini Baccarat (card game), Treasury Wheel (Australian Big Six wheel), Caribbean Stud Poker, Roulette, Craps, 3-Card Poker, Sic Bo, and Slot Machines. In addition, there was also a poker room offering Texas hold'em poker and Omaha cash games along with regular poker tournaments.


## Queen's Wharf

As part of the Queen's Wharf development by the Star Entertainment Group and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, a new casino opened in 2024.
