# Hyatt Regency Indianapolis



The **Hyatt Regency Indianapolis** is part of **PNC Center**, a mixed-use high-rise complex in Indianapolis, Indiana. The complex rises 22 floors and 268 feet (82Â m) in height, and is currently the 17th-tallest building in the city.


## History

The complex was formerly the site of the historic Hotel Lincoln and the D. Sommers & Company Building, both demolished in 1973. Constructed as **Merchants Plaza**, it was the headquarters of Merchants National Bank and Trust Company, previously located in the Merchants National Bank Building. Construction began in 1974 and was completed in 1977. The buildings were designed by Browning Day Pollak Associates.

Merchants National was acquired by Ohio-based National City Corporation in 1992 and the complex was renamed **National City Center** in August 1995, serving as the new bank's Indiana regional headquarters. The building was renamed **PNC Center** in 2010, after National City was acquired by PNC Financial Services.

The complex contains a 499-room Hyatt Regency hotel in one tower and commercial offices in a connected tower; a revolving restaurant, The Eagle's Nest, is located atop the hotel tower. The Hyatt Regency Indianapolis is the tallest mixed-use building in the city, and the second tallest building in the city located south of Washington Street.

According to the *Indianapolis Business Journal*, the Hyatt Regency Indianapolis has 220 full-time employees and was last renovated in 2018. As of 2020, four dining options were located in the hotel, including the Eagle's Nest, Level One Lounge, Fat Rooster Diner, and Starbucks.
