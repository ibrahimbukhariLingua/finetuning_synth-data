## History

Isuzu's Philippine debut came in the 1950s through its line of trucks. In 1972, General Motors and Isuzu formed a joint venture during the 1970s to create GM Philippines. More changes in management took place in the two decades that followed, leading to the creation of Isuzu Motors Pilipinas in 1989 as a subsidiary of Isuzu Motors Ltd. To pave the way for a new joint venture, the company ceased its operations in 1995. On August 7, 1995, Isuzu Philippines Corporation was formed. The company’s manufacturing facilities is located on industrial land located at the Laguna Technopark in Biñan, Laguna. Isuzu Philippines Corporation annually produces 8,000 to 15,000 vehicles. Directly adjacent to the plant are the works of **Isuzu Autoparts Manufacturing Corporation**, which produces transmissions.

In 1996, production began with the Hilander, the N-Series and the Forward. In 1997, the Fuego was introduced. A year later came the Trooper. In late 2003, the D-Max was unveiled, and in 2005 followed its sport utility vehicle variant, the Alterra. In 2007, the company offered the Isuzu NHR-PV, a 17-seater light commercial vehicle which is built on the N-Series chassis. On September 18, 2013, Isuzu debuted the second generation D-Max. Initially imported from Thailand, the second generation D-Max was assembled in Isuzu Philippines' Laguna plant from October 2013 until July 2019, in favor of re-importing D-Max from Thailand. In 2014, the MU-X was introduced, replacing Alterra. In 2019, the Traviz was introduced.
