## High Melton

The school is situated in High Melton within the University Centre (validated by the University of Hull and the University of Wales). Site facilities include a nine-hole golf course, learning resource centre and restaurant. High Melton is a small village, dominated by its church and nearby Hall. From the late seventeenth century, the Hall was owned by the Fountayne family and its descendants, the Wilson family, which changed its name to Montagu following an inheritance. The family were major landowners. In 1883, Andrew Montagu was the owner of over 27,000 acres (110 km²) of land in five counties. The Hall is now one of the main buildings on the High Melton campus.
