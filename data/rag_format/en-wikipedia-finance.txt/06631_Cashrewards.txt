## History

Cashrewards was founded in 2014 by Andrew and Lorica Clarke.

In 2018, Cashrewards launched its In Store Offers platform, with Visa Inc. The platform allows members with a Visa credit card or debit card to earn cashback at hundreds of stores in Australia.

In June 2019, announced plans for an initial public offering (IPO) by 2020. In October of that year allowed users of In Store Offers to use Mastercard to access cashback from participating retailers.

In July 2021, Cashrewards and ANZ launched Cashrewards Max. Exclusive to ANZ credit and debit card users, Cashrewards Max members received higher cashback offers from participating sellers.

In January 2022, the remaining stake in Cashrewards was acquired from a group of shareholders by 1835i, ANZ Bank's external innovation and venture capital partner.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ On 30 September 2022, the Cashrewards Max program was retired. In November 2022, ANZ Bank added a feature to their app that allows access to Cashrewards' cashback from the ANZ App.

In August 2024, Cashrewards acquired Little Birdie, a product search and real-time price tracking platform. The company plans to integrate Little Birdie with its Cashrewards platform.


## Philanthropy

In 2017, Cashrewards joined the Salesforce charity initiative "Pledge 1%". Cashrewards was founded by the Clarkes after their child survived a serious illness, so they chose the Starlight Children's Foundation, due to the support the organisation provided to their child during the illness. They pledged to match 1% of all cashback that their members withdraw and donate it to the Foundation.
