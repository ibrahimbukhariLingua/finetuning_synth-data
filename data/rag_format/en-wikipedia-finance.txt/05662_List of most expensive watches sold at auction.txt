List of most expensive watches sold at auction


# List of most expensive watches sold at auction



This list of **most expensive watches sold at auction** documents the watches sold at auction worldwide for *at least* 1.5 million US dollars. The final price listed is the total price paid by the buyer converted to US dollars, according to the currency exchange rate at the time of auction. This price is the aggregate of the hammer price (i.e., the winning bid or sale price at the auction) plus any buyer's premium paid to the auction houses (where levied, and in accordance with the rates charged by the relevant auction house). While the rates of buyer's vary between auction houses (which rates can also vary within each auction house based on the nature of the lot and its value), most auction houses publish their results inclusive of the buyer's premium, and so the rankings which follow are based on the aggregated price paid by the buyer: for the watch itself (the hammer or sale price) and for the auction house's services and administrative costs (the buyer's premium). Inflation-adjusted prices are also listed for reference. If a watch has been sold at auction for several times, only the highest final price is included. Finally, any auctioned watch without public online records from auctioneers (e.g. major auction houses) will not be included in the ranking.

As of December 2022, the most expensive watch (and wristwatch) ever sold at auction is the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (31,000,000 CHF) in Geneva on 9 November 2019. The most expensive pocket watch ever sold at auction is the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, fetching US$23.98 million (23,237,000 CHF) in Geneva on 11 November 2014.

As of December 2022, at least 115 timepieces have been sold at auction for over US$2 million, and at least 173 timepieces have been sold at auction for over $1.5 million. Among the top 10 of these watches, nine are Patek Philippe timepieces and one is a Rolex.
