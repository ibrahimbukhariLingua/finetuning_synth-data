## History


### 19th century

Siebert Irving Strayer founded Strayer's Business College in Baltimore in 1892. Strayer established the college to teach business skills to former farm workers, including shorthand, typing and accounting. Thomas W. Donoho joined the school in 1902.

In its first decade of operations, enrollment at the school gradually increased, attracting students from other states.


### 20th century

In 1904, Strayer opened a branch of the school in Washington, D.C.

Enrollment further expanded as demand for trained accountants grew after the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913 and World War I increased the need for federal government clerks with office skills. During the 1930s, the college was authorized to grant collegiate degrees in accountancy by the Washington, D.C., board of education. The school founded Strayer Junior College in 1959, when it was given the right to confer two-year degrees. In 1969, the college received the accreditation needed to grant four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees and was renamed Strayer College.

From the 1980s to the late 1990s, Strayer College grew rapidly; enrollment increased from approximately 1,800 in 1981 and 2,000 in 1983, to around 9,000 by 1997. The college expanded the range of degree programs and courses it offered to include subjects such as data processing management and health care management. In 1987, the college was given authorization to grant Master of Science degrees.

During the 1990s, the college began to focus on offering information technology courses. According to *The Washington Times*, high demand for computer training due to the increased use of computers in offices and movement toward "knowledge-based" employment led to higher enrollment at Strayer. In addition, Strayer began providing training programs in computer information systems for companies including AT&T Corporation and government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service. In 1996, the college launched Strayer Online to offer classes via the Internet.

In 1998, Strayer College was granted university status by the District of Columbia Education Licensure Commission and became Strayer University.


### 21st century

At the beginning of the 21st century, Strayer established its first campus locations outside of the Washington metropolitan area, adding campuses in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Since the early 21st century, Strayer has added additional campuses in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Texas, and West Virginia, according to the university's website.
