## Company history

Hume started as the Hume Co-operative Building & Investment Society Ltd. and was registered on 4 April 1955. Hume was founded by a group of Albury residents who were dissatisfied with the availability of funds for housing and wanted to help local people purchase their own homes. Hume provided a local alternative for housing finance, something that was becoming increasingly difficult for prospective homeowners to find because of regulatory rationing.

Hume officially changed its name to Hume Bank on 1 July 2014 after seeking approval from its customers and the governing body APRA in 2013. The name change reflects the banking products and services Hume now offers. Hume continues to be customer owned.
