100 point check


# 100 point check



The **100 point check** is a personal identification system adopted by the Australian Government to combat financial transaction fraud by individuals and companies, enacted by the *Financial Transactions Reports Act (1988) (FTR Act)*, which established the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) and which continued in existence under the *Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006*.

The 100 point system applies to individuals opening new financial accounts in Australia, including bank accounts or betting accounts. Points are allocated to the types of documentary proof of identity that the person can produce, and they must have at least 100 points of identification to be able to operate an account. The system now also applies to the establishment of a number of official identity documents, such as an Australian passport and driving licence.

Additionally, 100 point checking also applies in superannuation. Members are required to provide 100 points of ID when applying to transfer their accumulation funds (receiving monies) to a pension-based fund (paying monies).
"Reporting entities" are required to identify their customers using the 100 point check system. Accounts may be opened, but can only be operated (i.e. withdrawals made) by an identified customer; and an unidentified customer is blocked from making withdrawals. Generally, identification can be transferred from one account to another, so that for instance a person once identified does not need to produce documents again when opening a second account at the same institution.

An issue for many Australian organisations is the capture of credit card primary account numbers (PANs), referred to below under the 25 points section as credit cards or EFTPOS cards. This practice is not compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and must be removed from all 100 point check forms.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
