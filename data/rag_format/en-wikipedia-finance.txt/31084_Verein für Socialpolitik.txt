# Verein für Socialpolitik



The ***Verein für Socialpolitik*** (German: [fɛʁˈʔaɪn fyːɐ̯ zoˈtsi̯al.poliˌtːik]; literally: Association for Social Policy), or the **German Economic Association**, is a society of economists in the German-speaking area.


## History

The *Verein* was founded in Eisenach in 1872 as a response to the "social question". Among its founders were eminent economists like Gustav von Schmoller, Lujo Brentano and Adolph Wagner, who sought a middle path between socialist and laissez-faire economic policies. On the contrary, the liberal publicist Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim, critical of their "fanciful positions", dubbed them the *Kathedersozialisten* (socialists of the chair), meant as pejorative term. Gradually the Verein became less focused on social policy per se, and dealt with wider areas of economic policy and theory, especially after the First World War.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Among its later members were prominent sociologists like Max Weber and Werner Sombart. They took part in the famous Werturteilsstreit with the older generation of the *Verein* just before the First World War. The *Verein* was dissolved in 1936 under the Nazis, but was re-created in 1948 at a conference in Marburg.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Today, the *Verein* is headquartered in Berlin. It currently has around 3,800 individual members and 48 corporate members. It publishes a monograph series, the *Schriften des Vereins für Sozialpolitik*, as well as two journals: the *German Economic Review* and *Perspektiven der Wirtschaftspolitik*. The verein annually awards the Gossen Prize to German-speaking economists under the age of 45. Another award given by the association is the Gustav Stolper Prize; it is named after economist Gustav Stolper, and is not subject to any age restrictions.
