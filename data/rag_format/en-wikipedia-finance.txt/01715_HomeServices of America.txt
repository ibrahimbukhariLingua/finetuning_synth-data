## Legal issues

On November 1, 2023, a federal jury in Kansas City, Missouri, found Berkshire Hathaway and the National Association of Realtors liable to pay $1.78 billion in damages. The verdict came as the Warren Buffett–led brand, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, along with the National Association of Realtors, were found guilty of manipulating and artificially inflating the commissions on numerous home sales.

According to the jury in Kansas City, the manipulation resulting in inflated commissions caused an artificial rise in mortgage rates and property prices in the housing market.

The number of plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit included sellers of over 260,000 homes in Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. They raised concerns about the high commissions they were obligated to pay to the home buyers' brokers between 2015 and 2022. The trial lasted two weeks, after which the jury awarded the plaintiffs $1.78 billion in damages. The defendants in the lawsuit included Berkshire-owned HomeServices of America and its two subsidiaries, along with Keller Williams Realty.

The lead lawyer for the plaintiffs in this lawsuit was Michael Ketchmark. According to media sources, the awarded damages could be tripled to more than $5.3 billion under United States antitrust law.
