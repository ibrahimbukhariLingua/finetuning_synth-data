# PNC Center (Fort Wayne)



The **PNC Center**, previously known as **Fort Wayne National Bank Building** and the **National City Center** is the second tallest office building in Fort Wayne, Indiana.


## History

The 26 story Fort Wayne National Bank Building was built during 1969 but a series of work strikes caused delays. The general contractor was changed and the building opened in 1970. The building was owned by an Oklahoma company, Transamaerica Investment Group. It was designed to be a bank and office building. The developer was also an Oklahoma company, Kelly Marshall & Associates.

The office building previously stood as Fort Wayne's tallest building for 12 years (1970â€“1982) before being surpassed by the Indiana Michigan Power Center.
