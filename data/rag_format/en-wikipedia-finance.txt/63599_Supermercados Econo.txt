## History

Supermercados Econo started operations in 1970 and its headquarters are in Carolina.

The chain's first store was opened by Facundo Colon, a Puerto Rican businessman, at Hato Rey. In 1978, a store was opened at Plaza Carolina, a large mall in Carolina. The Plaza Carolina location is still open.

In March 2020 the supermarket chain announced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the first hour of operation would be exclusively for elderly customers.

In 2020 the chain celebrated its 50th anniversary by giving out $200,000 in cash prizes.

During 2022, several allegations were made against the supermarket concerning their sales of meat and refrigerated products, including that their Aguadilla location was selling old, rotten meats. The Aguadilla location was temporarily closed.
