## Insider trading allegations

Prosecutors alleged that Rengan Rajaratnam regularly shared confidential information with his brother, Raj Rajaratnam but he was cleared by a jury in July 2014.

During Raj Rajaratnam's trial, the jury heard Rengan Rajaratnam call former classmate and McKinsey junior partner David Palecek "a little dirty" and "boasted that he [Palecek] 'finally spilled his beans' by sharing corporate secrets." According to *Bloomberg*, when asked about AMD, Palecek allegedly said "Buy it, buy as much as you can as soon as you can."

Rengan Rajaratnam's own trial began before U.S. District Court Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in June 2014.

He was said to have acted on information from his brother and profits from the trades were alleged to be about $800,000. He was found not guilty in July 2014, after one day of jury deliberation on the original six counts of the indictment for which he was tried.
