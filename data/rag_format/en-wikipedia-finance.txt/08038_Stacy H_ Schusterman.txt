The daughter of oil executive Charles Schusterman and his wife Lynn Schusterman, she is active in the field of politics and donated $1.55 million to advocacy group Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI).


## Early life

Stacy Helen Schusterman was born circa 1963. Her father, Charles Schusterman (1935-2000), was an oilman who founded Samson Resources. Her mother, Lynn Schusterman, is a billionaire philanthropist. She has two brothers, Jay and Hal, who live in Israel.

Schusterman studied in Israel in 1983 before returning to United States to attend Yale University in 1985. Schusterman later received a master in business administration from the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin.


## Business career

Schusterman started her career at her father's oil and gas company, Samson Resources. She served as its chief executive officer from 2000 to 2011, when she sold it to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $7.2 billion. During her tenure as CEO, Schusterman switched the company investments from clean gas to oil, shale gas and tight gas.


### Samson Energy

After the buyout of Samson Resources, Schusterman founded Samson Energy, a deepwater drilling company whose main assets are on the Gulf Coast of the United States. She serves as its chair and chief executive officer. From 2019 to 2020, Samson Energy contributed $2.5 million to liberal groups.

Samson Energy's activities in Cheyenne, Wyoming are reportedly controversial due to their proximity to populated areas. In 2019, the Cheyenne Area Landowners Association voiced concern about the placement of Samson Energy drilling spacing units, which partially fell within city limits. In opposition to Samson Energy's proposed expansion, Wayne Lax, the vice president of the association, cited a study by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that found that fracking sites posed a health danger to individuals living within 2,000 feet.

In 1991, with Michael W. Dardick, Schusterman co-founded Granite Properties, a Plano, Texas-based real estate investment company. The company owns buildings in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Denver. By 2015, Granite Properties had an annual revenue of $182.7 million and 150 employees.
