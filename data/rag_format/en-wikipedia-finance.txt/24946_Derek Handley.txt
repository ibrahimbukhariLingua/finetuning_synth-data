## Career


### Early career

At 22, Handley founded a global online sports-betting business called Feverpitch which fizzled out, he listed on the venture-style New Capital Market of New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX), He subsequently led a merger of several companies in the New Zealand childcare sector and formed Kidicorp Group Limited, which backed into Feverpitch. The move was not an outstanding success and the Wright Family bought Kidicorp back in 2007 in a deal valuing it about $42m.

Handley also served as chair of Booktrack in 2012-2013, a company developing e-reader technology incorporating soundtracks for e-books. The company was also backed by Peter Thiel.

In 2013, Handley was named an adjunct executive professor for Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. Currently, he is studying religion at the Harvard University Extension School.


### Mobile industry ventures

Derek co-founded the global mobile technology and media company The Hyperfactory in 2001, prior to the proliferation of internet-enabled mobile handsets. The company went on to win numerous awards. It was subsequently acquired by media conglomerate Meredith Corporation (NYSE:MDP) though it is uncertain whether this was a successful purchase for Meredith as the company subsequently wrote off the investment.

In 2011, he co-founded the mobile advertising network Snakk Media,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ which listed on the NZ Alternative Exchange (NZAX) in 2013, becoming one of the first public B-Corporations. Handley stepped down from the Snakk Board in 2015. The company was later placed into voluntary administration due to financial difficulty in 2018, then later removed from liquidation in 2020.


### Chief Technology Officer of New Zealand

Handley's application for the governmental role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of New Zealand became a political controversy when he applied in 2018. The role was to be created under the auspices of Government Digital Services Minister Clare Curran. On 24 August 2018, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern dismissed Curran from the Cabinet after it became clear Curran had met Handley in February at her Beehive office to discuss his interest in the vacant CTO role. Curran had failed to disclose the meeting in her ministerial diary and to inform staff or officials about it (the second meeting she had failed to disclose). Curran apologised to the Prime Minister for her actions and eventually resigned as a Minister.

In September 2018, Handley announced that he had been offered, and had accepted, the CTO role in August. Soon after, the Government announced that it would not be proceeding with the role after concerns were raised by the business community and NZ entrepreneurs over Derek’s selection, suitability, and credibility, and paid Handley compensation of $107,000 (three months' pay plus reimbursement for moving costs). Handley said he was "deeply disappointed" by the process but the Government's decision to halt it was understandable due to the concerns raised.

## Personal life

In November 2017, Handley was granted New Zealand citizenship by the Minister for Internal Affairs, Tracey Martin, under the "exceptional circumstances" provision. The provision was required because he had not spent enough time in New Zealand to meet the usual requirements to become a citizen, since he was 865 days short. Handley argued that he did not meet the requirements because he frequently travelled for business.
