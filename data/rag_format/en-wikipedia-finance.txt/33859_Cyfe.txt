The company is known for its creation of the business dashboard app, designed to analyze, transform and report data from different integrated sources of business intelligence. It is a freemium application to track and monitor all business metrics in one single place. While its core markets are still located in United States, Cyfe has been expanding globally and now operates in 15 countries worldwide.


## History

Cyfe was founded in 2012, when Deven Patel, a serial entrepreneur and web software engineer, first attempted to look for simple applications that assembles current information from multiple sources into a single, consistent, and a coherent presentation format. Recognizing that many other individuals and organizations were facing similar issues with managing multiple social accounts, Patel realized that there was a potential market for an online business dashboard app, as small businesses and entrepreneurs spend most of their time in tracking and monitor their business data scattered across the web. Patel started developing an affordable mobile app with its team for small business that can connect to the social network, websites, blogs, email accounts, and others so that data can be recognized and displayed in a dashboard in the real time.

In 2012, Cyfe incorporated as a private company and launched it with a freemium pricing model. Within the same year, Cyfe introduced a Premium plan called Cyfe premium for paid service tiers, including unlimited dashboards and widgets, historical data, exports and other premium options.

In 2013, the Cyfe dashboard expanded its offering to further support analytics, marketing, sales and infrastructure tools including Eventbrite, Aweber, GetResponse, Stripe, RSS Feeds and others.

In 2019, Alpine SG acquires Cyfe along with 5 other startups.
