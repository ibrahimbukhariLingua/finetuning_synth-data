## Criticism and controversies

In 2016, the Government of Maharashtra released an official statement indicating that Adani Wilmar had violated regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Maharashtra while promoting its blended edible vegetable oil, Fortune Vivo. The company had made claims about the oil's medicinal properties, including its ability to regulate diabetes. Madan Yerawar, the Minister of State for FDA, stated that a raid was conducted on Adani Wilmar's storage facility in Panvel after deceptive information was identified on both the product advertisements and packaging.

Adani Wilmar, along with other members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, has been criticized for its role in deforestation and the loss of habitat for orangutans, tigers, and elephants in the Sumatra and Borneo regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The nonprofit Adani Watch states that "through its joint venture with Wilmar, Adani is a major refiner and trader in palm oil, an industry responsible for devastating large areas of rainforest in Southeast Asia."

In June 2022, C4ADS stated in its report that food companies, including Adani Wilmar, "continue to enable forced labor through their indiscriminate import of tainted palm oil."

On 9 February 2023, the Himachal Pradesh Excise Department raided the company's warehouses in the state.

In February 2023, Adani Wilmar's joint venture with KTV Group was penalized by the Supreme Court of India for violations of coastal regulations in Tamil Nadu. The company had constructed an oil storage facility and pipeline, and local fishermen claimed that oil leaks from the 7-kilometer pipeline were killing fish in the area. The court ordered that the facility be demolished.
