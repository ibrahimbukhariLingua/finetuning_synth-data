Turkish Coal Operations Authority


# Turkish Coal Operations Authority



The **Turkish Coal Operations Authority** (**TKİ**) is the state-owned enterprise which mines lignite coal in Turkey. Turkey is the third-largest lignite producer in the world, with 7% of total production. In 2018 TKI mined 30 Mt of which 16 Mt was open pit and 14 Mt underground: and in the same year 20 Mt was sold, 12.6 Mt to power plants and 7.4 Mt to industry and households. TKİ is on the Global Coal Exit List compiled by the NGO Urgewald (in German)ᵈᵉ. It employs about 4000 people.³⁴


## Economics

TKI's annual capital expenditure was ₺198 million (US$57 million) per year between 2016 and 2017., and the largest lignite mine in Turkey is Afşin-Elbistan. TKİ had been profitable but made losses in 2016 and 2017, and in 2021 the Court of Accounts criticised TKİ for losses which could continue for decades.


## Methane

Ventilation air from some mines such as Soma Eynez, contains significant methane; in 2019 studies were being done on how to capture it.
