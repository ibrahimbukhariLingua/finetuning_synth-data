### Reporters Without Borders case

In November 2024, French nonprofit organization Reporters Without Borders sued X Corp. in a French court claiming “X’s refusal to remove content that it knows is false and deceitful — as it was duly informed by RSF — makes it complicit in the spread of the disinformation circulating on its platform”.


## Resolved


### FTC case

In November 2023, a federal district judge dismissed a case brought by X Corp. to "end or modify" a consent order between the platform and the US Federal Trade Commission over X Corp.'s handling of user's information. The judge also denied X Corp's bid to end a FTC deposition of Elon Musk.


### Surveillance disclosures case

In 2014, Twitter sued the government to publicly release a report about the exact number of times the government served it with national-security orders, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that report to be classified.

### Bright Data case

In May 2024, a federal judge dismissed X Corp.'s US$1 million lawsuit against Israeli technology company Bright Data for alleged data scraping.

### Severance pay of Twitter staff

In July 2024, a district judge dismissed a case brought by former Twitter staff, who accused Musk of "unlawfully denying roughly US$500m in severance payments owed to workers fired after his takeover of the company."

### X Corp. shareholders case

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) alleges X Corp. processed personal data from May 7 to Aug. 1, 2024, affecting around 60 million EU users. X Corp. risks fines of up to 4% of its global annual revenue.

In September 2024, X Corp. suspended its use of data of EU-citizens to train Grok. It also deleted data collected between May 7 and August 1, 2024.


### Australia's Online Safety Act case

In October 2024, a federal judge dismissed X Corp's case against Australia's eSafety Commissioner's fine for "allegedly failing to respond to questions about harmful content on its platform, particularly child sexual abuse material".

### Trump nondisclosure order case

X Corp. unsuccessfully appealed a government nondisclosure order pertaining to an investigation into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 elections. X Corp. was fined US$350,500 in penalties for missing a judge's deadline to comply with the order, which X Corp. later paid. A federal appeals court rejected X Corp.'s objections and the US Supreme Court rejected to hear the case in October 2024, effectively ending X Corp.'s case against the government.


### Adeia case

In November 2024, X Corp. and technology licensing company Adeia Inc (ADEA.O) settled a lawsuit involving digital-media patents. X Corp. sued Adeia Inc in a California federal court in November 2023.


### German non-profits case

In February 2025, two German nonprofit organizations sued X Corp. in the Berlin regional court, alleging a breach of EU rules by not providing data to study how posts on the platform could influence the 2025 German federal election. Less than 72 hours later, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered X Corp. to grant "unrestricted access to all publicly available data" before and shortly after the elections.


### Trump J6 Twitter case
