**Lodestone Energy** Limited is a New Zealand electricity generation company that specialises in the construction and operation of photovoltaic power stations. As of January 2025, it operates three solar farms, with one more under construction.


## History

In May 2021, the company announced plans for five solar power stations, capable of generating one percent of New Zealand's power. In June 2022, it completed a $300 million capital raise to fund its initial projects. Investors in the company included Rod Drury, Sam Morgan, and Stephen Tindall.

In July 2023, Lodestone Energy was granted a NZ$15 million working capital facility by Green Investment Finance to fund its solar farm developments. In October 2023, it announced a partnership with British joint venture HES Aotearoa to develop a further nine solar farms. In January 2024, the company announced plans to build three solar farms in Canterbury as part of the partnership. In April 2024, it completed a $55 million capital raise to fund further expansion.

Construction of the company's first solar farm, Kohirā, began in early 2023 and was completed in February 2024. In September 2023, Lodestone Energy signed a long-term supply contract with The Warehouse Group to supply their retail stores with electricity. In August 2024 the company announced it had acquired sites for two new solar farms in the Manawatu from Kiwi Solar, and that it planned a third.
