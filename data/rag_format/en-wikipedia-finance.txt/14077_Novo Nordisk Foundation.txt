Novo Nordisk Foundation


# Novo Nordisk Foundation



The **Novo Nordisk Foundation** (NNF) is an international enterprise foundation focusing on medical treatment and research.

In 2023, the foundation had a net worth of DKK 1,114 billion (US$167 billion), making it the wealthiest charitable foundation in the world. NNF owns Novo Holdings A/S, a holding company that is the majority voting shareholder of Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical corporation.

From 2016 to 2022, the foundation distributed more than US$4.5 billion in grants for research, innovation, treatment, education, humanitarian and social purposes. In 2023, the Novo Nordisk Foundation awarded grants worth 9.1 billion DKK (approx. $1.33 billion) and paid out 5.8 billion DKK (approx. $0.84 billion).

While the main focus lies within biomedicine and biotechnology research, NNF also awards grants for research in general practice and family medicine, nursing and art history.


## History

In 1922, Danish professor August Krogh received permission to produce insulin in the Nordic countries. This sparked the development of new diabetes treatments and the beginning of a Danish business and export venture. Several foundations were also established which have subsequently merged into the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

In recent years, the Novo Nordisk Foundation has increased its focus on innovation, diabetes treatment and grants for humanitarian and social purposes. In 2016, the Novo Nordisk Foundation awarded a little over 420 million US dollars to the Capital Region of Denmark to establish Steno Diabetes Center in Copenhagen, a diabetes treatment and research institution. In 2020, the Novo Nordisk Foundation established the BioInnovation Institute in Copenhagen with a €470 million grant, an independent Novo Nordisk Foundation aimed at accelerating life science start-ups.


## Legal structure

The Novo Nordisk Foundation is an established enterprise foundation. It is a self-governing entity with no owners, focusing on long-term ownership of the Novo Group (Novo Nordisk and Novozymes) while combining business and philanthropy with scientific, humanitarian and social purposes. The Novo Nordisk Foundation's investment activities are managed by its 100%-owned subsidiary, Novo Holdings A/S whose sole purpose is to invest the foundations wealth and ensure financial returns.
Novo Holdings A/S is also the holding company for the foundation's ownership in Novo Group (Novo Nordisk and Novozymes).


### Ownership structure

The Novo Nordisk Foundation is obligated to maintain its controlling ownership in the Novo Group's two largest companies: Novo Nordisk and Novozymes.

* The foundation owns class A and B-shares in Novo Nordisk corresponding to approximately 28 percent of the total equity and approximately 75 percent of the total voting rights.
* The foundation owns class A and B-shares in Novozymes corresponding to approximately 25 percent of the total equity and approximately 71 percent of the total voting rights.

The class A-shares in both companies (Novo Nordisk and Novozymes) are unlisted and consequently cannot be publicly traded. The voting weight of the A-shares are 10 times those of B-shares in both companies.

The current chairman of the Novo Nordisk Foundation is Lars Rebien Sørensen (former CEO of Novo Nordisk) and Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen is the current CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

The foundation's financial endowment is maintained by dividends and returns on these investments.


## Types of grants

The Novo Nordisk Foundation offers grants under five main models:

* Open-competition Grants: These are regular research grants awarded through open calls to the academic community. They include both shorter-duration project-focused grants and longer-duration research leader grants.
* Stand-alone Grants: These are awarded within the Novo Nordisk Foundation's focus areas based on peer reviews. They encompass project grants, research leader grants, investigator grants, fellowships, infrastructure grants, and more.
* Partnerships: Grants awarded for collaborations with public and/or private partners.
* Impact Investments: Targeting companies like start-ups, often in the form of loans and investments, to support activities with positive societal impact.
* Own Initiatives: Grants for initiatives that start as local units of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and then are spun out as independent foundations.

### Distribution of grants

The foundation has an objective of providing support for scientific, humanitarian and social purposes. The grants go primarily to support research in biomedicine, biotechnology, general medicine, nursing and art history at public knowledge institutions. Humanitarian and social purposes includes the Steno Diabetes Center research hospital.

## Criticism


### Role in research and funding

The level of research funding concentration granted from enterprise foundations has consistently been a central issue in science policy discussions. Intensive concentration has been viewed both as a means to enhance and direct research investments effectively and as a concerning trend leading to excessive competition, reduced diversity, and the selection of conservative topics.

There is a focus on evaluating potential imbalances in the distribution of research funds in Danish society regarding the role of the Novo Nordisk Foundation in advancing scientific research and innovation.

One criticism is related to the foundation's significant economic influence in the research landscape. The substantial grants from the foundation may inadvertently overshadow other sources of research funding and potentially lead to a concentration of resources in certain research areas closely aligned with the foundation's priorities and interests.

Concerns have been raised about the potential influence of the Novo Nordisk Foundation's agenda on the direction of scientific research. Critics express concerns about the potential effect of the foundation's allocation of funds on the diversity of research topics and perspectives within the Danish scientific community, as it tends to prioritize projects that align with its strategic goals.


### Funding disparities

The Novo Nordisk Foundation has faced criticism for the concentration of its research funding, often favouring a select group of established researchers. This trend, prevalent in many countries, leads to funding disparities, where a majority of resources are allocated to a small percentage of researchers, often to the detriment of early-career, female, and diverse researchers. In response to these concerns, the Novo Nordisk Foundation has introduced partial randomisation in its grant allocation process. This approach was designed to mitigate biases and increase the diversity of funded research, aiming to support projects that might otherwise be overlooked. The effectiveness of this strategy has been under evaluation during a three-year trial period.


## Research initiatives


### Stem cell-based therapy research

In 2018, the Novo Nordisk Foundation invested in stem cell-based therapy research to focus on new therapeutic approaches for chronic diseases, exploring the regenerative potential of stem cells.


### COVID-19 pandemic

The Novo Nordisk Foundation contributed to support the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020. As of June 2020), the foundation had donated DKK 366.2 million (approx $55.77 million) for COVID-19 related measures, including test centres in Denmark (DKK 250 million for 11 COVID-19 test centres ), financing research projects aimed at mitigating the health consequences of COVID-19, emergency production of ethanol in cooperation with the Carlsberg Foundation to manufacture hand sanitizers and disinfection.


### Pandemic antiviral discovery initiative

In 2022, the Novo Nordisk Foundation formed in partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Open Philanthropy to focus on developing accessible oral antiviral treatments for viruses with pandemic potential. The initiative aimed to support researchers globally in identifying and developing phase 2-ready antiviral drug candidates.


### Vaccine development for respiratory diseases

In 2023, the Novo Nordisk Foundation allocated $260 million to develop vaccines for respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. This initiative, known as the Novo Nordisk Foundation Initiative for Vaccines and Immunity (NIVI), collaborated with the University of Copenhagen and Denmark's Statens Serum Institut. It emphasised generating immunity in the airway, a novel approach in vaccine development.


### Combatting antimicrobial resistance and tuberculosis

In 2023, the Novo Nordisk Foundation worked on developing vaccines and treatments for tuberculosis, addressing the broader issue of antimicrobial resistance.
