## Company history

First announcements about the establishment of TMR with an initial capital of US$125 million in Bermuda were made in 2000. TMR was expected to start its operation beginning of April 2000 with Shin-ichiro Okada named as CEO. The parent company initially announced that TMR's primary mission was not to earn a profit through assumed reinsurance but to use reinsurance as a tool to make effective use of its capital.

Effective August 1, 2006 Tatsuhiko Hoshina became CEO and president of TMR.

The Zurich branch of TMR was registered in August 2010. Stephan Ruoff was appointed CEO of the branch in May 2011.

TMR announced the opening of an Australian branch in March 2011 after having received authorisation by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The branch was capitalised with A$80 million of assets in Australia. The expectation for this undertaking was to identify property and casualty treaty opportunities emanating from Australia and New Zealand. Russell Brooke was appointed managing director of the branch.

TMR was acquired by RenaissanceRe in 2018 for $1.5 billion.


## Rating history


### Standard & Poor's

In June 2000 TMR received a AAA rating from Standard & Poor's. The outlook on the rating was negative, due to the expectation that TMR's rating would follow that of its mother company, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.

In February 2001, this rating was revised to AA+ with outlook negative. Standard & Poor's stated that aside from the then recent lowering of Japan's sovereign rating, the rating was reflective of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. modest underwriting performance as well as the unfavorable situation of the Japanese non-life insurance industry.

In September 2004, Standard & Poor's affirmed TMR's AA− rating and upgraded the outlook from negative to stable. Because Standard & Poor's criteria require ratings of strategically important subsidiaries to be at least one notch below the rating assigned to the parent company, Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. issued a guarantee. This allowed TMR to carry the same rating as its parent company. For the same reason, the outlook was adjusted to the outlook of the parent company.

In May 2007 Standard & Poor's revised its position and raised the financial strength rating from AA− to AA. Standard & Poor's expected TMR to maintain strong credit quality due to its very strong financial profile.

In January 2011 TMR was downgraded from AA to AA− due to the lowered sovereign rating of Japan.


### A. M. Best

In June 2003 A. M. Best announced that it had affirmed the financial strength rating of A++ to TMR together with a negative rating outlook.

In July 2005 TMR's rating was yesterday downgraded from A++ to A+ by A.M. Best. The outlook however was revised to stable from negative. The downgrade was triggered by a new insurance group methodology of A.M. Best.

In November 2009 A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating of A+ with stable outlooks. The strategic importance of TMR to Tokio Marine Group's overseas expansion initiative was pointed out. It was further stated that TMR benefited from the global recognition and balance sheet strength of its parent. The rating was assumed to reflect TMR's excellent financial strength, favorable operating performance over the last several years and its prudent risk management practices.

In November 2011 TMR was upgraded from A+ to A++ by A. M. Best. The decision of A. M. Best was based on TMR's expansion into standard lines of reinsurance, conservative investment portfolio, and strong capitalization, thanks to it being a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.
