## History

Hela Clothing (Pvt) Ltd was incorporated in 1991. The Fielding Group was the initial owner of the company. British entrepreneur Dominic McVey invested in Hela Clothing in 2013. Sri Lankan business executive Dian Gomes was hired by McVey to lead the company. By 2017, the company was incurring sizeable overheads and facing cash flow constraints. The company was forced to expand into Ethiopia and Kenya. Gomes wanted to raise capital by either infusing capital from existing shareholders or diluting 30% of ownership to raise US$10 million from outside investors. Gomes's relationship with McVey was strained when Gomes wanted to suspend the annual management fee of US$1 million to the investment firm Ellestone Apparel, a company headed by McVey. In 2019, Gomes resigned from the company and McVey divested significantly his stake. An investor consortium infused US$10 million into the company's capital in November 2018.

Hela Clothing appointed A. R. Rasiah as the new chairman of the company in December 2018. Hela Apparel Holdings (Pvt) Ltd was founded in 2018 and was listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2022 through an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO was intended to offer 20% of the stake of the company and raise the capital of LKR4 billion. The IPO was the largest issue since 2011. The IPO was oversubscribed 5.4 times and received applications worth LKR21.8 billion.
