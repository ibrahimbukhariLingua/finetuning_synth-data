The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life


# The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life



***The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life*** (ISBN 0553805096) is a biography of Warren Buffett by Alice Schroeder.


## History

Before this book was written, Warren Buffett rejected numerous approaches by biographers, journalists, and publishers to cooperate on an account of his life. After spending six years as the only Wall Street analyst Buffett would speak to, Alice Schroeder was approached by Buffett to write his biography. In 2003, she left her job at Morgan Stanley and traveled to Omaha to work on the book full-time. Schroeder spent over 2,000 hours reading Buffett's personal files while interviewing Buffett, his wife, children, sisters, friends, and business associates. Before Schroeder began writing, Buffett told her he would not ask for any revisions once the book was finished and, where accounts of his life differed, to always use the "less flattering version."
