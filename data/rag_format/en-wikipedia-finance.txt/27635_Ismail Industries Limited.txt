## History

Ismail Industries' history goes back to a confectionery factory founded by Haji Ahmad Chandia in Sukkur during the 1960s. The business was unsuccessful, so the factory was closed in 1964. Later, Chandia founded another confectionery business with his four sons called Union Biscuit Private Limited in Karachi. The business was successful, but began to decline with the death of the heir apparent, Ismail. Following his death, the family reestablished a company in his name called Ismail Industries Limited in 1988. The company was listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange in 1989. Miftah Ismail, former Finance Minister of Pakistan, joined his family business in 1994 after completing his education in the U.S.

In 1990, Ismail Industries established its first subsidiary, Candyland, which introduced soft jellies such as Chilli Milli in Pakistan. Candyland is also for producing Fanty, Super Twister, and Paradise.

In 2002, Ismail Industries founded Bisconni which later became known for its Cocomo biscuit. Bisconni is also known for launching Rite cookies.

In 2006, SnackCity was launched to make snack foods in Pakistan. SnackCity is known for producing Kurleez, a line of crisp snacks.

In 2013, Ismail Industries acquired 24.5 percent stake in the Bank of Khyber.

In 2021, Ismail Industries established a polyester resin (PET resin) manufacturing plant with an annual production capacity of 108,000 tons.
