### Founding and early history

Gilbane has its roots to 1870 when founder William H. Gilbane started a carpentry and general contracting firm. His brother Thomas Gilbane joined him and the officially formed William Gilbane and Brother in 1883. The company first focused on building homes and later expanded to churches, hospitals and other buildings. Some of the earlier buildings they constructed include the Roger Williams Park Museum of Natural History and Planetarium and the Holy Name Church. Despite a fire destroying the company headquarters in 1897, Gilbane continued in business and in 1900 constructed a home for then Brown University president William Faunce. The construction established a relationship with the university by where Gilbane would later build an administrative building and the Brunonia Hall dormitory. By 1900, it employed more than 200 people.

Gilbane was officially incorporated as Gilbane Building Company in 1908. William H. Gilbane’s sons, William J. Gilbane and Thomas F.
