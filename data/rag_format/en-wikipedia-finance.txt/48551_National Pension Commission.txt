## Controversy

* In September 2022, After a report claiming that the least salary at PenCom was 3 million naira per month, the commission dismissed the claim saying its highest paid staff earns less than 1 million naira per month.
* In January 2023, some members of the Nigerian senate and pension operators disagreed over the request of the Nigeria Police Force to be exempted from the Contributory Pension Scheme. The senators, representatives of the Nigerian Police Force and the police retirees cited the need to have an independent pension scheme in line with the Police Pension Board Establishment Bill 2022 and to alleviate the police from the alleged poor service of the Contributory Pension Scheme. Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria and The National Pension Commission explained that the exemption of the Nigerian Police Force would set back the country's pension system.
