His principal work there was the establishment of a system of cost-benefit appraisal of public investment projects. He was also involved in energy policy work and was on the board of Indian Oil Corporation. He was the member-secretary of the National Commission on the Development of Backward Areas. In 1983 he served concurrently as secretary of the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister of India.

Returning to India in 1987, Desai was made special secretary in the Planning Commission and, in 1988, secretary and chief economic adviser in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. In the latter capacity he coordinated the preparations for the 1989 and the 1990 budgets of the Central Government.


### United Nations

In 1990, Desai's services were requested by the United Nations. From 1990 to 1993, he was the deputy secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (1992 Rio Earth Summit). In that capacity one of his primary responsibilities was to co-ordinate the work of the Secretariat related to the development of Agenda 21, the principal programmatic outcome of the conference.

In early 1993 the then United Nations secretary-general established three new departments at United Nations Headquarters in the economic, social and related fields. In February 1993 he appointed Nitin Desai at the under-secretary-general level to head the newly created Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development. The substantive work of this department supported the various United Nations intergovernmental bodies, including the Economic and Social Council, and the Commission on Sustainable Development.

In March 1997, Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed Desai to co-ordinate, and subsequently head, the consolidated Department of Economic and Social Affairs which provided substantive support to the normative, analytical, statistical and relevant technical co-operation processes of the United Nations on the economic and social side. In that capacity Desai organised and managed the Copenhagen Summit on Social Development (1995) and the Monterrey Summit on Finance and Development (2002). Desai was also the convener of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs which brings together the heads of all the UN Secretariat entities directly concerned with economic, environmental and social issues.

In October 2001, the secretary-general asked Desai to act as secretary-general of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002 Johannesburg Summit). A special feature of this Summit was the focus on the developmental and environmental aspects of water, energy, agriculture, health and bio-diversity. The summit also led to practical partnerships between governments, international organisations, the private sector and non-governmental organizations to address these concerns. Desai undertook this task in addition to his existing responsibilities.
At the end of August 2003, Desai retired from the UN but continued his association with the UN as a special adviser to the secretary general for the World Summit on the Information Society. In that capacity he chaired an international multi-stakeholder Working Group on Internet Governance.
