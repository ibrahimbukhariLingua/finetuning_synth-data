## History

Dongfeng Mine, a state-owned enterprise in Tibet, was created in 1967. In 1984, sanctioned by the former Ministry of Metallurgy and the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, the original team from Dongfeng Mine relocated to Lobusha Township in Qusum County, Shannan, Tibet, to initiate the infrastructure and mining operations at Lobusha Mine.

In early 1997, several enterprises under the People's Government of Tibet Autonomous Region were restructured into Tibet Mining Industry Co. On July 8, 1997, the corporation was registered on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

On June 4, 2020, Baowu acquired Tibet Mining Assets Management Co., Ltd. from the TAR State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Following the acquisition, China Baowu Iron and Steel Group emerged as the primary shareholder, while TAR SASAC became the secondary major shareholder.

In August 2021, the Tibet Mineral Development announced its intention to invest in the second phase of the Zabuye Salt Lake Green Comprehensive Development and Utilization Project, specifically the 10,000 Tons of Battery-grade Lithium Carbonate Project, with an expected investment of RMB 2 billion.
