Linqto's automated delivery platform allows banks to select and brand fintech apps, makes them available for internal testing, and distributes them to app stores Apple, Google, and Amazon.

In March 2019 Greg Kidd of Hard Yaka Inc invested $1M into Linqto to fund the exploration of strategic partnership opportunities with Hard Yaka entities including Globalid.

### Products

Linqto's self-directed investment platform has no fees and investment minimums are $5,000 for first-time and subsequent investments.

Linqto deploys special purpose vehicles (SPVs) on its investment platform for investors to buy and sell equity in private technology companies. Linqto uses SPVs because it is a separate company that is bankruptcy remote, allowing members to invest without needing to get on the cap table of each private company they invest in.
