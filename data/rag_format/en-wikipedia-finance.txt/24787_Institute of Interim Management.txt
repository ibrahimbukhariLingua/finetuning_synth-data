Institute of Interim Management


# Institute of Interim Management



The **Institute of Interim Management** (**IIM**) is a UK based professional body for those working in Interim Management in the United Kingdom and internationally.


## History

The **Institute of Interim Management** was formed and launched in April 2001, with the encouragement and support of the Interim Management Association (IMA) and the Chartered Management Institute (CMI).

Until August 2002, the **IIM** operated as a Special Interest Group through the CMI infrastructure. Given the **IIM'**s growing need for greater emphasis on its own specialist area of management, and to facilitate a higher profile for Interim Management within industry and commerce, in August 2002, by mutual agreement with the CMI, the **IIM** pursued an independent status.

A full history of IIM can be found on the Institute's website.


## Activities

Activities for IIM Members and wider members of the Interim Management community are organised and run by its volunteer Board of Interim Managers and supporting community individuals.

A key activity since 2010, is the IIM Interim Management Annual Survey, which has grown in size and stature ever since. It covers key areas of interest to all interims such as numbers on assignment and off,male/female split and other demographics, average day rates as well as the Leading ISP rankings, a ranking of the top ISPs viewed from the lens of an Interim Manager. The 15th Annual Survey was published in July 2024.

The IIM organised 140+ events from its formation until the COVID-19 pandemic stopped them in their tracks. Since mid-2020, we have like many groups, moved online and typically run around 12 webinars, including a 3-4 times pa series for those new or interested in a career in Interim (Introduction to Interim Management), 2-3 each year derived from the Annual Survey mentioned above, and others on a variety of topics. For 2024 we also trialled a series of 8 Virtual Coffee conversations in shorter, round table discussion format, with small groups of Members and guests and an Affiliate subject matter expert, on a range of topics. We expect these Virtual Coffees to continue into 2025 and also aim to restart face to face events during the year..
