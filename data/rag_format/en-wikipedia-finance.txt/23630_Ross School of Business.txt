## History


### Early history (1900–1923)

The first business courses were offered at the University of Michigan in 1900. Economics Department Chairman Henry Carter Adams oversaw the expanding practical courses to prepare students for business careers. The idea for the school came from the economics department. In 1918, the university's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts began issuing a Certificate of Business Administration. In 1923, University President Marion LeRoy Burton hired Edmund Ezra Day to serve as the founding dean of a new business school.


### Founding (1924–1925)

The '*University of Michigan School of Business Administration* was founded in 1924; it offered a two-year Master of Business Administration after three years of general studies. There were 14 faculty members, including one of the first women to be part of a business school. In 1925, the Bureau of Business Research was founded to facilitate and coordinate faculty research and publish research monographs and case studies.


### Clare Griffin era (1926–1943)

In 1926 after serving three years, Day was replaced as dean by Clare Griffin, who initially came to the university to teach marketing. The same year, faculty member William Andrew Paton founded *The Accounting Review*. In 1935, the school began offering a PhD in Business Administration. In 1938, the first evening Master of Business Administration (MBA) classes were offered. In 1940, school enrollment reached 200 students. Between 1942 and 1943, a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree was introduced.


### Russell Stevenson era (1943–1959)

In 1943, Russell Stevenson became the school's third dean. In 1947, enrollment exceeded 1,000 students, reaching 800 BBA students and 400 MBA students by 1949. In 1948, the school opened a new building that cost $2.5 million and had a nine-story tower. The same year, prominent economist Paul McCracken joined the faculty. From 1950 to 1959, the school introduced the Public Utility Executive Program, its first stand-alone, non-degree program for continuing education of business executives.


### Floyd Bond era (1960–1978)

In 1960, Floyd Bond became the school's fourth dean. The same year, the school launched its first international joint venture in Taiwan and Bond appointed a committee to better integrate global business into the school's curriculum. In 1966, Bond established the Ad Hoc Committee on Educational Programs in Business Administration for Negroes, which tried to attract more African-American students but the initiative and a number of student strikes and other protests in the following years demanded more minority enrollment. In 1971, the school began a $1.5 million expansion of the physical facilities and assembly hall. By 1971, total enrollment exceeded 1,300, more than three-quarters of whom were graduate students with 370 in the Evening MBA Program. In 1972, the school's first two alumni clubs in New York and California, held their first meetings. In 1974, Alfred Edwards joined the faculty as a professor of business administration and director of the research division, later becoming known as the school's ambassador for diversity.


### Gilbert Whitaker era (1979–1990)

In 1979, Gilbert Whitaker became the school's fifth dean and established an enlarged Office of Development & Alumni Relations. In 1980, total degree-program enrollment reached 2,000, including about 600 BBA students, while the number of faculty members exceeded 100. From 1980 to 1989, Whitaker stablished 17 joint-degree programs with other U-M units. In 1982, he announced a $15 million fundraising campaign for three new buildings, including a library. The campaign raised $17 million, and the buildings opened by 1984. In 1983, the school joined the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management and began offering a Master of Accounting degree. In 1990, the school received a federal grant to establish a Center for International Business Education.


### B. Joseph White era (1990–2001)

In 1990, B. Joseph White became the school's sixth dean. In 1991, White and Associate Dean Paul Danos introduced a major MBA curriculum overhaul by initiating the Multidisciplinary Action Project (MAP), a full-time, seven-week project that allowed teams of students to work on real-world business challenges for sponsor companies. After a pilot run, it became part of the MBA core curriculum in 1993. In 1995, an international MAP option was created as a separate program. In 2015, MAP became an option in the undergraduate curriculum.

In 1992, the William Davidson Institute was founded. In 1995, the Tauber Institute was founded as a joint project with the College of Engineering. In 1996, the Global MBA Program is introduced, allowing students to study abroad in one-month terms. The same year, the Frederick A. and Barbara M. Erb Environmental Management Institute was established. In 1999, the Samuel Zell and Robert H. Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies was founded. In 2000, Sam Wyly Hall opened to house Executive Education and other programs. The same year, the number of faculty members approached 200. In 2001, the school introduced an Executive MBA Program, which targeted business leaders in supervisory positions.

During White's tenure, other initiatives, such as research on how to supplement the GMAT, helped cement the school's reputation for innovations that produce business leaders.


### Robert J. Dolan era (2001–2011)

In 2001, Robert J. Dolan became the school's seventh dean. In 2002, the John R. and Georgene M. Tozzi Electronic Business and Finance Center was established.

The school would later found the Center for Positive Organizations. In 2004, alumnus Stephen M. Ross donated US$100 million to the school, which was renamed the **Stephen M. Ross School of Business**. This was the largest-ever gift to a U.S. business school and to the University of Michigan. The Ross gift funded a campus overhaul; the school demolished 180,000 square feet (17,000 m²) of existing building space and renovated or added 270,000 square feet (25,000 m²).

In 2006, the Ross Leadership Initiative, later renamed the Sanger Leadership Center, was established to improve the leadership development of MBA students.

The same year, a Minor in Business is offered for non-business undergraduate students. In late 2013, the school launched a major fundraising campaign.

In 2014, a new 10-month Master of Management degree was introduced. The same year, the school began sponsoring the annual Positive Business Conference.

The Desai Accelerator for startup businesses—a joint effort between Ross and the University of Michigan College of Engineering—opened in downtown Ann Arbor in 2014. The same year, Davis-Blake oversaw a large, donor-funded construction project that includes the new Jeff T. Blau Hall, as well as renovations to several older buildings on the business campus.

In 2015, Davis-Blake announced that she would step down at the end of her five-year term in 2016 to pursue a broader role in higher education. In 2015, Michigan Ross announced the Alumni Advantage program that offers free lifetime open-enrollment executive education tuition for all its degree alumni and half-price tuition for non-Ross UM alumni. In 2016, the Jeff T. Blau Hall and the renovated Kresge Hall opened.

## Student life

Ross School of Business students publish a newspaper called the *Monroe Street Journal* and houses the *Michigan Journal of Business*, the first undergraduate-level academic journal in the field of business.

A Ross MBA community tradition is the Ross MBA college football tailgate, which takes place before and after every home game at "The Bus", a 1985 Ford school bus that is painted in maize and blue, Michigan's colors, and is decorated with a dance floor, a DJ on the roof, and couches in the interior. On game days, The Bus is parked in a nearby Lumber Yard for an event called the Ross MBA tailgate, which attracts over 500 students, alumni, and friends. As of 2013, this tradition had been intact for the last decade. After the bus "died" in 2013, a group of MBA students started a crowdfunding campaign on Tilt.com to purchase a new mobile tailgate bus.
