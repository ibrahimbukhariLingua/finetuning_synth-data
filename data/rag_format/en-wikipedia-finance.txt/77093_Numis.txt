## History

The firm was originally formed in 1989 as a merger between Hemsley & Co Securities and Raphael Zorn and was known by the name of **RZH Ltd** before rebranding as Numis in 2000.

In 2016, Oliver Hemsley stood down as Numis CEO after 25 years. Alex Ham and Ross Mitchinson succeeded Hemsley as co-CEOs, with Ham running the firm's advisory and corporate broking arm and Mitchinson its equities business.

In April 2023, Deutsche Bank agreed to acquire Numis in an all-cash deal valued at £410 million. When the purchase was completed on October 13, it was announced that it could be known as Deutsche Numis.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
