## Dieselgate and arrest

A week later, Stadler was arrested and held in a prison in Augsburg. Prosecutors claimed he was tampering with evidence because of a phone call in which he suggested putting a witness on leave.

Four weeks later, Stadler was released from custody against bail and under other conditions. Prosecutors continued naming him as a suspect.
