**Kimberly-Clark de México** **(KCM)** is a Mexican company that engages in the manufacture and commercialization of disposable products for daily use by consumers within and away-from home in Mexico and internationally.

Today, the company has 8,000 direct employees and over 10,000 indirect jobs.


## History

The origin of KCM dates to the "La Aurora" Paper Factory in 1925 in the municipality of Naucalpan, in the State of Mexico. In 1932 Kimberly-Clark Corporation entered Mexico with its Kotex and Kleenex brands. By 1959, Kimberly-Clark Corporation acquired 100% of the capital of the La Aurora factory, thus becoming Kimberly-Clark de México.

In 1962, Kimberly-Clark Corporation sold 40% of KCM's shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange, marking an important milestone in its history.

In the following years, KCM continued its growth:

* 1973: KCC sold another 17% of KCM shares, to become a Mexican company.
* 1996: KCM acquired and merged Grupo Crisoba, incorporating plants in Ecatepec, Morelia, San Rafael and Texmelucan.
* 2006: KCM sells one of its Business Groups, Industrial Products (PRODIN); forming a new company: GRUPO PAPELERO SCRIBE S.A de C.V.
* 2012: Acquisition of the feeding business of Evenflo Company, expanding their presence in the market.
* 2015: Introduction of Kleenex Soaps, further diversifying their offering.
* 2016: The Escudo Antibacterial brand is acquired from P&G.

On October 22, 2019, the CEO announced that Kimberly-Clark de Mexico will no longer be making short-term investments in Mexico, due to differences with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and a general slowdown in the economy. This was promptly followed by calls for a boycott of the company. However, this statement was clarified by the company by issuing a statement denying those reports.

In July 2020, the FDA included a number of products by 4E Global, a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark, on its "do-not-use" list of dangerous hand sanitizers due to possible methanol content.
