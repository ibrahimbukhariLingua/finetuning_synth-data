## History

Wiz was founded in January 2020 by Assaf Rappaport, Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik, and Ami Luttwak, all of whom previously founded Adallom.

Wiz agreed to acquire Tel Aviv-based Raftt, a cloud-based developer collaboration platform, for $50 million in December 2023. In April 2024, the company acquired cloud detection and response startup, Gem Security, for around $350 million. Also that month, reports indicated that Wiz intended to purchase Lacework, but in May the deal fell through during the due diligence process. In November 2024, the company acquired security remediation and risk management startup Dazz for a cash-and-share deal valued at $450 million.

In 2024, it was reported that Google was in talks to buy Wiz at a reported valuation of $23 billion, but Wiz turned down the offer, in favor of going public.

## Research

Wiz researchers have discovered and responsibly disclosed numerous cloud vulnerabilities that garnered significant media coverage:

* ChaosDB – A series of flaws in Microsoft Azure's Cosmos DB that made it possible to download, delete, or manipulate databases belonging to thousands of Azure customers.
* OMIGOD – Bugs in Open Management Infrastructure (OMI), a ubiquitous but poorly documented agent embedded in many popular Azure services, that allowed for unauthenticated remote code execution and privilege escalation.
* NotLegit – Insecure default behavior in the Azure App Service that exposed the source code of some customer applications.
* ExtraReplica – A chain of critical vulnerabilities found in the Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server that could let malicious users escalate privileges and gain access to other customers' databases after bypassing authentication.
* AttachMe – A cloud isolation vulnerability that, before it was patched by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, could have allowed attackers to access and modify other users' OCI storage volumes without authorization.
* Hell's Keychain – A first-of-its-kind cloud service provider supply-chain vulnerability in IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL that, before it was patched, could have allowed malicious actors to remotely execute code in victims' environments.
* BingBang – A misconfiguration in Azure Active Directory (AAD) that allowed Wiz researchers to modify Bing.com search results in a way that malicious actors could use to steal Office 365 credentials granting access to countless users' private emails and documents.
* DeepSeek – Wiz said it has found a trove of sensitive data base from the artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek inadvertently exposed to the open internet.
