## Airport Network


### Julius Nyerere International Airport

Julius Nyerere International Airport is the largest airport managed by Swissport Tanzania. Originally ground handling services at the airport were managed by Dar es Salaam Airports Handling Company (DAHACO) a majority government owned company since 1985. In 2000 the company was privatized and Swissport International acquired 51% stake making its entry into the country. The company operates both ground handling and cargo handling at the airport and in 2014 the airport brought in around 80% of the company's revenue. The company also has a licence to provide Aircraft maintenance and re-fueling services, however has yet to serve any airline with those services. The company has been the sole operator of ground handling services at the airport however after 2014 the government liberalized the industry and began to issue licences to various companies.


### Kilimanjaro International Airport

DAHACO began Kilimanjaro International Airport ground handling services in 1990 and was the first expansion project from Dar-es-Salaam International Airport. The acquisition of DAHCO in 2000 added the airport to the company's portfolio. Swissport provides both ground handling and cargo services at the airport and is the only airport in the network that is facing declining revenue. Swissport maintains a branch office in Arusha and operations for Kilimanjaro Airport Development Company are handled from the arusha branch.


### Songwe Airport

Songwe airport began operations in 2012 and Swissport expanded its presence to the airport in October 2013. Currently the airport is only served by Fastjet Tanzania and is swissports sole customer at the airport. The airport is destined to become a major cargo hub in the southern region of the country and swissport eyes on capturing the cargo market in the future.


### Mtwara Airport

Due to the slow growth at Dar-es-salaam and Kilimanjaro airports Swissport expanded into Mtwara airport. The airport was added to the Swissport Portfolio at the same time as Songwe Airport. With the increasing presence of companies in the south due to Oil and gas exploration, Swissport plans to capitalize on the growing demand for passengers and cargo into the region.
