## Career


### Matchesfashion.com

In 1987, Chapman founded Matchesfasion.com as a single store in Wimbledon Village. At the age of 21, Chapman met Ruth Chapman and convinced her to join the business. By 2011 MATCHESFASHION.COM was the largest independent fashion retailer in London with 14 stores.

In 2007, the company was one of the first luxury brands to go online. Chapman led the company's digital strategy and turned the business into a multi-channel e-commerce retailer.

Chapman said the original motivation for launching the website was to provide a single view of the stock as well as build a customer database and was initially surprised by the success of the website as a sales tool. From the launch of the website, the business grew at up to 100 percent per year. As of 2018, the company stocks over 450 brands shipping to 176 countries, making 95 percent of sales online and 85 percent internationally.

In 2011, Chapman launched No. 23, a townhouse dedicated to private shopping to complement online retail. In 2012, the company raised £20 million in venture capital from SEP and Highland Capital Partners at a valuation of £76 million. In 2013, Chapman rebranded all Matches' physical stores MATCHESFASHION.COM to "unify" the brand.

In 2016, the company launched 90-minute delivery to shoppers in London. In 2018, the business opened 5 Carlos Place, a five-storey townhouse combining luxury private shopping in a home environment with a broadcasting hub and events space. Chapman was also responsible for introducing iPads into the company's stores, which accounted for more than 50 percent of in-store sales.

In 2015, Chapman stepped down as joint chief executive to become joint chairman.

Matchesfashion.com was acquired by Apax Partners in 2017. Chapman retains a minority stake in the business and remains on the company board.
