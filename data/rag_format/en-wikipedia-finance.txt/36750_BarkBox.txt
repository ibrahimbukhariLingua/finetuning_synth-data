# BarkBox



**BarkBox** is a monthly subscription service providing dog products, services, and experiences. BARK serves over 2 million dogs monthly through BarkBox and Super Chewer subscriptions and retail distribution.

On December 17, 2020, Barkbox, Inc. and Northern Star Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: STIC.U), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement. As a result of the transaction, which values the Company at an enterprise value of approximately $1.6 billion, BARK will become a publicly listed company on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol, "BARK".


## History

The company was founded December 2011 by Carly Strife, Matt Meeker, and Henrik Werdelin. Prior to co-founding BarkBox, Meeker co-founded the social networking site Meetup.com. Meeker currently serves as CEO. Werdelin had founded Prehype.

In April 2013, the company raised $6.7 million in a venture funding. The company surpassed the $25 million revenue run rate the same year. BARK received an additional $15 Million in Series B funding led by Resolute.vc, along with RRE, BoxGroup, Lerer Ventures, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, Slow Ventures, Daher Capital, CAA, Vast Ventures, and City National Bank in 2014.

BARK launched BarkCam in early 2014, a photo sharing app which operates as an "Instagram for dogs" and their owners.

BarkBox allows owners to personalize their dog's monthly subscription boxes based on their dog's needs. Each dog is unique and requires different toy options to match their style of play.

The app is connected to rescue centers and shelters across the United States and Canada, and there are approximately 300,000 dogs in the database. The app sources many of its adoptable dogs from the pet adoption website Petfinder and from BARK's personal network of shelters and rescue organizations.
