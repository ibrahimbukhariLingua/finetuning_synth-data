Two years later, the product was launched to the public as Uniface 3, and the company name was changed to Uniface B.V. In 1994, the company was bought by Compuware Corporation. That same year Uniface Six, the first version that used a GUI, was launched. Uniface's rapid deployment platform kept on evolving and in 2012 Uniface 9.6 was launched. One of the first intelligent development platforms that we now call low code. In 2014 the company was acquired by Martin Equity Partners, and became Uniface B.V. again. In 2016 Uniface 10 was launched. In February 2021 Uniface was acquired by Rocket Software to become part of the Business Line Database & Connectivity.
