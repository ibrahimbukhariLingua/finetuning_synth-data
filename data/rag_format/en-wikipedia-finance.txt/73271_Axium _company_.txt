## History

In 1983, Alan Mills formed a joint venture with Timberline Software and developed the architecture & engineering specific product offering. On September 27, 1996, Timberline Software sold its Architecture & Engineering product line to Mills and Cathy Mills. In 2004, Axium launched an entirely new software platform, Ajera, which makes up its core offering today. The company announced plans to move to neighboring Tigard's Lincoln Center in 2010. The company had revenues of $10.9 million for 2011 and had 78 employees at that time. Axium was sold in December 2012 to 2ndWave Software, but was to retain its headquarters in Oregon.

Axium launched a new product, Project Trek, in 2014. This came after the company acquired ArchitTrek in March 2014 in an effort to add collaboration and construction project management to its offering.


### Acquisition by Deltek

In June 2014, Axium was acquired by Deltek, Inc. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. While Deltek announced plans to incorporate Axium's software solutions into their own offering and reported that the acquisition would speed their growth, Axium continues to operate as a separate entity and serve their 3,500+ existing customers.
