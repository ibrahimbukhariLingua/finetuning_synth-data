# Kruger Inc.



**Kruger Inc.** is a Canadian private company which manufactures publication papers, lumber and other wood products, corrugated cartons from recycled fibres, green and renewable energy, and wines and spirits. Kruger Inc. operates facilities in Québec, Ontario, British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the United States. KP Tissue, Inc. is a separate, publicly traded holding company, headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.


## History

The origins of Kruger Inc. date back to 1904, when Joseph Kruger founded a fine paper business in Montreal. Gene H. Kruger, the founder's son, became president of the company in 1928 at the age of 25 and expanded it into the manufacture of newsprint, paperboard, and tissue products.

As chairman of the board and CEO, Joseph Kruger II, Gene's son, has overseen the company's continual expansion into specialty publication papers, North American tissue products, wines and spirits, forest and wood products, renewable energy and recycling, as well as its modernization with special emphasis on the environment.


## Activities

The company's activities are divided into two major divisions: Industrial Products (publication papers, forest products, containerboard and packaging) and Consumer Products (tissue products, wines and spirits). Kruger Inc.’s subsidiary, Kruger Energy, develops and operates hydroelectric, solar, wind power, biomass cogeneration and biogas energy projects.

Kruger has sorting and recovery centres that supply its mills with recycled paper and containerboard for the production of recycled stock and recycled paper products.

## Boreal forest destruction

A 2007 Greenpeace report on the state of Canada's boreal forests states, "Less than 48 per cent of the total area under Kruger management in Quebec and Ontario remains intact. Kruger is involved in severe controversy on the Island of René-Lavasseur, where logging is carrying on not only in intact forest areas but also in important caribou habitat and without respect for the rights of traditional land owners, the Innu First Nation of Betsiamites....None of Kruger's forested lands is certified to the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council." Kruger achieved FSC certification in March 2011.
