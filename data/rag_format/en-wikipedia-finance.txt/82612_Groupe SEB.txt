# Groupe SEB



**SEB S.A.** or better known as **Groupe SEB** (***S**ociété d'**E**mboutissage de **B**ourgogne*) is a large French consortium that produces small appliances, and it is the world's largest manufacturer of cookware. Notable brand names associated with Groupe SEB include All-Clad, IMUSA, Krups, Moulinex, Rowenta, Tefal (including OBH Nordica), Mirro and WMF Group. According to the Groupe SEB website, they have faced considerable competition from low-price Chinese competitors, but have managed to maintain a constant sales level. A large proportion of their product lines are now manufactured in China. Its headquarters are in Ecully, a Lyon suburb.


## History

The precursor to the Groupe SEB consortium was originally formed by Antoine Lescure in 1857. In 1977, they released the dedicated first-generation home video game console Telescore 750. Later, they released two revisions, the Telescore 751 and the Telescore 752.


## Recent performance

For the first half of 2008, Groupe SEB reported an increase in profit from 52 million euros in 2007 to 94 million euros. Groupe SEB now has a 61% interest in the Chinese cookware company Supor. For the second half of the year, Groupe SEB did not predict major changes in outlook.

In 2004, Groupe SEB acquired the high-end American cookware company All-Clad. Weakness in the European markets is expected to be balanced out by further growth in North America and Asia.


## Controversies

Groupe SEB has faced criticism for its continued presence in the Russian market following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite publicly promising to suspend new investments and "sharply" reduce activities in Russia, the company has been accused of not significantly scaling back its operations. Reports indicate continued active recruitment of employees, including for head office positions, with incentives such as European business trips and potential future relocation, raising questions about the sincerity of Groupe SEB's commitment to reducing its presence in Russia.
