## History

The platform incorporates AI-driven workflows and a conversational interface to simplify the home-buying process and provide users with data on factors such as location, market trends, and rental income.

In 2021, reAlpha raised $9M through an IPO. The campaign included a satirical deepfake video featuring a fictionalized version of Elon Musk, which explained crowdfunding concepts and received over 1.2 million views. The company went public in October 2023, and raised $8 million in gross proceeds through a public offering in November 2023.
