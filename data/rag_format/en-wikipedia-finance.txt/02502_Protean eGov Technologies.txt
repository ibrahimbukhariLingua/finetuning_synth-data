## History


### National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)

The company (now Protean eGov Technologies Limited) was originally incorporated on 27 December 1995 under The enactment of Depositories Act, December 1995 by Government of India, as NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited, a depository registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In 1996, the company received a certificate for the commencement of business from the Registrar of Companies (RoC). It was the first and largest depository in India and has been involved in the development and implementation of various technology infrastructure projects in the country.

In 2004, the company launched initiatives such as the Tax Information Network (TIN), Pan Card Issuance, and Online Tax Accounting System (OLTAS). In 2005, it launched the Electronic Accounting System in Excise and Service Tax (EASIEST) and began managing it on behalf of the Central Board of Excise and Customs. The company also manages the Tax Information Network (TIN) for the Income Tax Department, Government of India. As part of this system, Protean facilitates the issuance of Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards and enables electronic submission of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) returns, along with assisting banks in uploading tax payment data.

In 2008, the company was appointed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) as the Central Recordkeeping Agency (CRA) for the National Pension System of the Government of India. The company has developed and implemented 19 projects across seven ministries in India.

In 2011, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) appointed the company as a Registrar for the implementation of the UID mission in India, and in 2013, the company launched e-KYC services.


### Formation of NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Ltd.

In 2012, NSDL transferred its depository business, including services under the Depositories Act, to its former subsidiary, NSDL Depository Limited. Later that year, in December, NSDL rebranded as NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited as part of this business restructuring. The company was subsequently rebranded again as Protean eGov Technologies Limited to reflect its broader focus on IT services and expansion into new areas. The company is backed by the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), and Unit Trust of India (UTI), with shareholders including banks like Canara Bank, HSBC, Citicorp Finance India, Standard Chartered Bank, Mauritius-based fund Soach Global, State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, and Deutsche Bank AG.

The company also diversified into e-sign service and was shortlisted as the GSP (GST Suvidha Provider) by GSTN (GST Network) in 2017.

The company expanded its operations into the digital commerce sector by joining the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and launched a marketplace called *Rise with Protean*, which focuses on APIs, microservices, and related areas. In April 2024, 360 One WAM (formerly IIFL Wealth Management) sold a 5.3% stake in Protean through open-market transactions.

The company also formed a partnership with Grameen Foundation for Social Impact (GFSI) to enhance access to financial services for underserved communities, particularly women and marginalized groups.

In September 2024, Protean announced its bid for the Income Tax Department of India's PAN 2.0 project. This initiative by the IT Department aimed to create, manage, and maintain the PAN database as well as consolidate PAN and Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN) services.

In the same year, PayNearby entered into a partnership with Protean to develop a credit marketplace for borrowers, including small business owners, under the ONDC.
