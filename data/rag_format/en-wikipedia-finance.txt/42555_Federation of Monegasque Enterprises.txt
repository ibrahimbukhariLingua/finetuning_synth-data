For 75 years, it has supported the development of Monégasque companies and the country's economic development. In 2014, the Monégasque Employers' Federation changed its name to *Fédération des entreprises monégasques* to keep up with the current business environment.

## Response to Covid-19 Crisis

In May 2020, FEDEM filed a request for annulment of the law from 11 May 2020 governing dismissals during the health crisis, before the Supreme Court of the Principality. The president of FEDEM, Philippe Ortelli, criticized the Monégasque executives for having added safeguards to the flexibility measures, in particular the clause prohibiting dismissals in the companies concerned. On 2 December 2020 the Supreme Court rejected the FEDEM's appeal.
