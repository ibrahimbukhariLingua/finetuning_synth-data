Passenger facility charge


# Passenger facility charge



A **passenger facility charge** (**PFC**) is a fee that almost all airline travelers in the United States pay in their ticket price. The fee goes toward the upkeep and maintenance of airports, and is set up and capped according to US federal law.

The law allows airports to charge up to $4.50 for every enplaned passenger at public agency-controlled commercial airports. Airports must use the money from the fees to pay for projects approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that, according to the FAA, "enhance safety, security, or capacity; reduce noise; or increase air carrier competition."


## History

Beginning June 1, 1992, commercial airports that were controlled by public agencies began collecting passenger facility charges. The charges were added to airline tickets and, at the time, were $3 per passenger, per leg. Effective 2001, due to passage of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, Congress raised the PFC cap to $4.50 per ticket or $18 per round trip.

Each month, the FAA publishes the "Key Passenger Facility Charge Statistics". The report summarizes the annual amounts given to airlines by the airports that collect the PFCs.

When the PFC program began, airlines were given 12 cents out of each PFC. In 1994, that amount went down to 8 cents. Between 2000 and 2004, the rate increased to 11 cents.

President Barack Obama, in his 2015 budget request, asked for the cap on fees to be raised to $8, which is slightly less than what airports had wanted.
