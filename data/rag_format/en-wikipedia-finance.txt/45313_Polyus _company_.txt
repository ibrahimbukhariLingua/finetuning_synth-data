## History

Polyus was founded as Polyus Gold (Russian: Полюс Золото) in March 2006, as a result of a spin-off from the gold assets of Norilsk Nickel.

In May 2006, shares of Polyus Gold were admitted to listing and trading on the Russian stock exchanges RTS and MICEX (both of these later merged to form the Moscow Exchange). In December 2006, ADRs of Polyus Gold were listed and admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange. Due to the sanctions imposed against it, the company plans to delist its depository lists from the LSE on July 25, 2023. Sanctions against Polyus were simultaneously imposed on May 19, 2023 by the United States, Great Britain and Australia.

In 2009, the businessman Suleyman Kerimov bought a 37% stake in Polyus Gold from Vladimir Potanin. In 2015, the family of Suleyman Kerimov acquired 59% of Polyus Gold International Ltd (the parent holding company of Polyus Gold) and became the controlling shareholder of Polyus Gold. On 3 December 2015, Polyus Gold International Limited announced the delisting of its shares from the London Stock Exchange.

In 2016, Polyus Gold changed its name to *Polyus*.

In June 2017, Polyus’s shares were re-admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
