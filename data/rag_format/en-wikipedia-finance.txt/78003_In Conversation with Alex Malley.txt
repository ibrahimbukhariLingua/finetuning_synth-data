In Conversation with Alex Malley


# In Conversation with Alex Malley



***In Conversation with Alex Malley*** is an Australian television interview show on the Nine Network.

The program was funded by CPA Australia and featured its controversial then-CEO Alex Malley interviewing leaders from the world of politics, business and entertainment.


## Cancellation

The TV show was abruptly cancelled in 2017 when Malley was fired as CPA Australia's CEO and stripped of his lifetime membership.

Malley's termination followed a dispute with CPA members over his $1.7m salary as well as the use of CPA funds to produce and promote *In Conversation with Alex Malley* and otherwise build Malley's personal profile.

A report published following Malley's departure revealed that CPA paid Channel Nine $4.16 million to broadcast the program as well as spending another $1.2 million to advertise the program on billboards.

All mentions of the TV show were removed from CPA's website within days of Malley's termination.

## Reception

Kylie Northover of *The Sydney Morning Herald* wrote of the interview with the violinist and conductor Andr√© Rieu, "It's a non-threatening half-hour chat with the world's most successful classical musician ... It's a pleasant enough half-hour, but don't expect any deep revelations. Justin Burke praised the show in *The Weekend Australian*, stating, "This might not be the most revolutionary TV format: seated interviewer facing seated interviewee. Readers, particularly of the business pages, will have their views about the host Alex Malley. (Mine are that he does a solid job here.) But there can be no debate that an interview with Andy Thomas, the only Australian-born professional astronaut, is anything other than unmissable TV."
