**Galerías** is a Mexican chain of shopping centers that is part of the El Puerto de Liverpool group, a Mexican company that consists of commercial, financial, and real estate operations. The group has three divisions:

* The commercial area operates two chains of department stores: Liverpool and Suburbia, as well as freestanding retail stores of multiple fashion brands, and the **Arco Norte** logistics center, under construction.
* The financial group offers insurance as well as credit to customers of the two department store chains.
* The real estate group operates the Galerías malls.

El Puerto de Liverpool is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) under the ticker symbol LIVEPOL. The company also holds a 50% stake in Unicomer, a company that has retail chains in 26 Latin American countries. The Group's headquarters are in Santa Fe, a suburb and a main business center in Mexico City.

All of the Galerías shopping malls are branded Galerías, except for Perisur, in deference to its historic status as the first large American-style mall in Mexico.
