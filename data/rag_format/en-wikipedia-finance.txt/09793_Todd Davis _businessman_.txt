# Todd Davis (businessman)



**Richard Todd Davis** (born 1968), also known as **Todd Davis**, is an American businessman. He is the co-founder of LifeLock, an American identity theft protection company based in Tempe, Arizona, that became a subsidiary of Symantec in 2019.


## Education

Davis received his Bachelor of Business Administration in entrepreneurship and management from Baylor University in 1990.


## Career

After graduating from Baylor, Davis served on executive management teams of several technology startups. He joined Dell in 1992, where he signed clients such as 3M. Davis became a member of the President's Elite Circle and received the Dell Vision Award while with the company. In 2002 Davis started his own business, Marketing Champions, where he served as CEO and worked with teams from NASCAR and the Indy Racing League (now known as the IndyCar Series).

In 2005 Davis and Robert Maynard Jr. cofounded LifeLock, a personal fraud protection company. Davis served as CEO of LifeLock since its founding. As part of a marketing campaign to promote his company's credit monitoring services, Davis posted his social security number (457-55-5462) on billboards and commercials. As a result, he was a victim of at least 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008, belying LifeLock's claims that its services protect consumers against identity theft and fraud. The Federal Trade Commission imposed a $12 million penalty on the company for deceptive advertising, likening Davis and LifeLock marketers to "con artists."

In 2010 the company ranked eighth on Inc.'s 500 list. In 2012 Davis took the company public. By 2014 LifeLock had over 3 million subscribers and 700 employees.

In January 2016 Davis resigned as CEO of LifeLock; he became executive vice chairman of the Board of Directors on March 1, 2016. LifeLock became NortonLifeLock in February 2017.
