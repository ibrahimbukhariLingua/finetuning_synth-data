Go! Mokulele


# Go! Mokulele



**go! Mokulele** was an American business marketing inter-island flights within the state of Hawaii. The airline was a joint venture between Mesa Airlines and Mokulele Flight Services formed in October 2009 when the companies merged their competing airline business subsidiaries, go! and Mokulele Airlines, under one umbrella company. Mesa Air Group owned approximately 75% of the company, while Transpac and other Mokulele shareholders owned approximately 25%. The airline had its headquarters in Honolulu CDP, City and County of Honolulu. Following Mesa's late 2011 divestiture of its ownership stake in Mokulele, Mesa announced it was discontinuing the "go! Mokulele" brand.

Go! Mokulele did not hold its own air operator's certificate. Instead, flights were operated by Mesa Airlines and Mokulele Airlines for Go! Mokulele.
