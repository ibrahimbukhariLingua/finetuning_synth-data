LunaJets


# LunaJets



**LunaJets** is a private jet broker with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, where it has been based since it was founded in 2007 by former Ogilvy advertiser Eymeric Segard. Additionally, they have opened offices throughout the years in London, Paris, Monaco, Riga and Dubai.

It is privately owned by two of the founders.

As an online broker, the company does not own any aircraft, but rather matches operators and private jet owners with end user private jet clients to provide on-demand shorter flights and empty leg flight services. Over the years, LunaJets has developed a global network of 350 operators and access to 4,800 aircraft. LunaJets, therefore, has access to all categories of aircraft, both turboprop and jet-powered, ranging in size from Very Light Jets, such as the Cessna Citation Mustang, to VIP Airliners, such as Boeing Business Jets (BBJs) and Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJs).


## History


### 2000s

LunaJets was founded in December 2007 by Eymeric Segard, the company's acting CEO, after raising $US2million from private investors. The initial concept was to create an online platform to provide "empty leg flights", and last minute “empty seats” on private planes flying empty at a discount from market price. ‘Empty legs’, also called in the industry as “deadhead,” “positioning, “or “ferry flights,” are planes flying without any passengers due to the need to reposition or return to their home base, among other reasons. They can be available at a discount of up to 75% of regular prices. At the time, entrepreneur Richard Branson launched a similar concept named "Virgin Charter" with entrepreneur Scott Duffy, but for Lunajets, the concept of jet sharing and the resale of private jet seats did not work. Virgin Charter, who at the time employed 100 people, stopped its operation in 2009 when private jet charter dropped dramatically due to the financial crisis. LunaJets however had sold its first empty leg seat by July 2008, shortly after Eymeric Segard had created LunaJets. The same year they developed their online booking platform with proprietary technology. In 2009 they launched their website branding itself as high tech, full service and low commission on demand private jet charter flights.


### 2010s

In 2010, LunaJets rebranded itself as a low-cost provider of private jet charter flights under the “fly private at the best price” slogan, offering on-demand charter flights and empty legs, and additionally opened up a new office in Hungary. In October 2014, Lunajets launched the third version of its website. In May 2015, LunaJets introduced the first version of their mobile application (available on iOS, RiM and Android) presented by CNBC as the Uber of private aviation. As of 2015, LunaJets opened a regional office inside the Private Jet Terminal in Olbia, Italy and in Dubai and a new office in Ibiza. At that time, they had expanded to around 25 employees.

In 2017, LunaJets employed 40 individuals from 20 different nationalities, speaking 12 languages. The company reported 60 million Swiss francs in annual sales in 2018, a 40% increase from 2017. That year, LunaJets organized approximately 5,000 flights, a 35% increase compared to the previous year. In 2018, the economic magazine Bilan awarded LunaJets the title of Best Employer of the Year.

In 2010, LunaJets sold around 550 seats and had approximately 10 employees. By 2019, the company had increased its operations to 6,000 flights and expanded its workforce to 50 employees.


### 2020s

In 2021, LunaJets reported over 100 million Swiss francs in annual sales and organized more than 8,000 flights. The company employed 60 people across six key locations, including Geneva, Paris, London, Riga, Monaco, and Dubai. LunaJets experienced a record year in 2021, particularly in flight volume, as they served over 1,100 new clients for long-range flights spanning all continents. Additionally, LunaJets opened a new office in Monaco and relaunched their London office in 2021. In August of that year, the company also operated emergency charter flights out of Kabul.

In 2022, LunaJets continued to grow, with over 12,000 movements and 1,250 new clients, generating more than 150 million Swiss francs in revenue, a 40% year-over-year increase.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
