## Bankruptcy Restructuring with EchoStar

In October 2010, TerreStar filed for a "prepackaged" bankruptcy, led by its largest secured creditor, EchoStar. Together the secured creditors exchanged $940 million of debt for about 97 percent of the company. The plan, along with $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing, was approved in November 2010.
In December 2010, an NPO called "A Human Right" mounted an effort to buy the satellite for use over Africa, with basic free internet service for those who don't have it, and internet access for nations that have cut off international internet connections.

After successfully bidding $1.375 billion for the acquisition of the TerreStar-1 satellite in a bankruptcy-court auction, Dish Network on August 22, 2011, asked the Federal Communications Commission to let the company utilize the wireless spectrum of TerreStar to offer its own wireless broadband service.
