## Research Interests

Professor Ziebarth's research focuses on the economics of paid sick leave. While he has also published papers on health insurance, risky behavior, and measurement of health, he is a principal social scientists producing a stream of policy-relevant, causally identified research on the consequences of sick pay mandates. Dr. Ziebarth started his research on sick leave during his PhD in 2007 in Germany. Since 2010, he has published more than a dozen peer-reviewed papers on sick leave in economic and policy journals. Several of these papers study the consequences of US state-level mandates for employee behavior, analyze their impact on take-up and coverage, and investigate their relevance for labor costs, job creation, wage dynamics and unintended consequences such as crowd-out of non-mandated benefits

With coauthors, he studied the relevance of sick pay coverage on presenteeism behavior ("working when sick") and the spread of infectious disease. In the last several years, his research in this area has been featured in prominent publications such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the Economist.
