## History

Institut d'Économie Scientifique et de Gestion (IÉSEG Lille) was founded in 1964 in Lille by the economist and former dean of the Université Catholique de Lille, Michel Falise. In 1976, the private school was recognized by the Ministry of National Education (France) and became member of the Conférence des Grandes écoles in 1997. In 2002, IESEG was one of the first business schools in France which started to propose a Master in management fully taught in english.

From 2006, IESEG started to collaborate with the CNRS in a shared laboratory and is since then, one of the business schools in France with HEC Paris and others to have this agreement.
In 2012, the school received the EQUIS accreditation, in 2013 the AACSB and in 2013 AMBA.

In recent years, IESEG chose to not develop overseas campuses but instead, to develop the Lille and Paris campuses. In contrary to most colleges and universities in France, the Lille campus is accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.


## Grande École System

IÉSEG School of Management is a *Grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, *Grandes Écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although they are more expensive than public universities in France, *Grandes Écoles* typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the *Grandes Écoles*. Many of the top ranked business schools in Europe are members of the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* *(CGE)*, as is IÉSEG, and out of the 250 business schools in France, only 39 are *CGE* members.

Degrees from IÉSEG are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (French: *Le Ministère de L'éducation Nationale*). IÉSEG is further accredited by the elite international business school accrediting organizations and it holds the much coveted Triple accreditation: The European Foundation for Management Development (EQUIS), The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and Association of MBAs (AMBA) In 2022, the Financial Times ranked its Masters in Management program 26th in the world.


## Programs

Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the *Licence*/Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees. A Bachelor's degree requires the completion of 180 ECTS credits (bac+3); a Master's, requires an additional 120 ECTS credits (bac+5). The highly coveted PGE *(Program Grand École)* ends with the awarding of Master's in Management (M.M.) degree. Outside of the PGE, students at IÉSEG can be awarded other Master's degrees, such as the MBA (bac + 5)
