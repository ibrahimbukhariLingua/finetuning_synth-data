Due to Legge Amato, the bank was split into a company limited by shares (*società per azioni*) and a banking foundation (Ente Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato, later renamed to Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di San Miniato) on 13 April 1992 (gazetted on 14 May). The bank immediately sold about 70% shares of the bank to Holding Casse Toscane (literally *Tuscan Savings Banks*), a new intermediate holding company for the savings bank (Italian: *Cassa di Risparmio*) of San Miniato, Florence, Livorno, Lucca, Pisa, Pistoia–Pescia, and Banca del Monte di Lucca. The *ente* received about 12% shares of Casse Toscane in return, making the *ente* had a minority interests in other banks, but only hold about 30% shares of their own bank directly or about 38.4% combined.
