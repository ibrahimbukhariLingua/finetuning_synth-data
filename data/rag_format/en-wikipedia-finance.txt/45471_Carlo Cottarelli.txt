## Political career


### 2018 government formation

The March 2018 election resulted in a hung parliament, with no coalitions able to form a majority of seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. The election was seen as a backlash against the establishment with the Five Star Movement and the League becoming respectively the first and third largest parties in the Parliament.

After weeks of political deadlock, Mattarella gave the private law professor Giuseppe Conte the task of forming a new cabinet at the head of a populist coalition formed by the Five Star Movement and the League, who had reached a substantial agreement on a government agenda. However, on 27 May 2018, Conte renounced the office due to contrasts between the League's leader Matteo Salvini and President Sergio Mattarella. Salvini proposed the university professor Paolo Savona as Minister of Economy and Finances, but Mattarella strongly opposed him, as the media considered Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German. In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the Eurozone, and as the guarantor of Italian Constitution and country's interest and stability he could not allow this. On the following day, Mattarella gave Cottarelli the task of forming a new government.

In the statement released after the designation, Cottarelli specified that in case of confidence by the Parliament, he would contribute to the approval of the budget law for 2019, then the Parliament would be dissolved and a new general election would be called for the beginning of 2019. In the absence of confidence, the government would deal only with the so-called current affairs and lead the country toward new elections after August 2018. Cottarelli also guaranteed the neutrality of the government and the commitment not to run for the next election. He ensured a prudent management of Italian national debt and the defense of national interests through a constructive dialogue with the European Union. On 28 May 2018, the Democratic Party (PD) announced that it would abstain from voting the confidence to Cottarelli, while the Five Star Movement and the center-right parties Forza Italia (FI), Brothers of Italy (FdI) and the League announced their vote against.

Cottarelli was expected to submit his list of ministers for approval to President Mattarella on 29 May. However, on 29 May and 30 May he held only informal consultations with the President. According to the Italian media, he was facing difficulties due to the unwillingness of several potential candidates to serve as ministers in his cabinet and may even renounce. Meanwhile, Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio announced their willingness to restart the negotiations to form a political government, and Giorgia Meloni, leader of FdI, gave her support to the initiative. On 31 May, when M5S and the League declared of having reached an agreement regarding a new cabinet, Cottarelli resigned from his position.


### Member of the Senate

In 2022, Cottarelli was candidate of the centre-left coalition to the Senate of the Republic, being elected in the multi-member district of Lombardy for the Democratic Party (PD). However, in May 2023, he resigned from his post due to contrasts with the new leader of the party, Elly Schlein.
