Shop Pay


# Shop Pay



**Shop Pay** (formerly Shopify Pay) is a checkout and payment method developed by Shopify. Users add shipping and billing information to a Shop account, which enables one-click checkout on online stores that offer Shop Pay.

In 2024, Shopify reported that Shop Pay had over 150Â million users worldwide.

Shop Pay relies on a payments processing service, such as Shopify Payments (the default option) or another payment provider, to process transactions. Businesses on other platforms, such as Facebook Marketplace, can also offer it as a payment method.


## History

In April 2017, Shopify announced the checkout feature called Shopify Pay. Later that same year, the company announced a new package tracking app, Arrive, which tracked customer orders from brands on the platform and other online shopping sources.

Early in 2020, a rebranded Shop Pay button appeared on participating checkouts; later that spring, Arrive was rebranded as Shop.

In 2024, Shop Pay expanded to other commerce platforms and no longer required businesses to be on Shopify to use it.
