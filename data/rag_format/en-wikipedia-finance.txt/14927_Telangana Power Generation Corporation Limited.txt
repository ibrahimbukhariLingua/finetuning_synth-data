## History

The erstwhile Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board which came into existence in 1959 was responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Under the Electricity Sector Reforms agenda, government of Andhra Pradesh promulgated Andhra Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act, 1998. The erstwhile APSEB was unbundled into one generating company (APGENCO), one transmission company (APTRANSCO) and four distribution companies (APDISCOMs) as part of the reform process.

Later, on 2 June 2014, when the state was bifurcated, APGENCO distributed all the assets, liabilities and power stations to both the states and Telangana Power Generation Corporation (TGGENCO) was formed for the newly formed Telangana state and APGENCO remained for Andhra Pradesh in accordance with the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. All the plants (thermal, hydel and solar) located in Telangana region were transferred to Telangana Genco on an "as is where is" basis.
