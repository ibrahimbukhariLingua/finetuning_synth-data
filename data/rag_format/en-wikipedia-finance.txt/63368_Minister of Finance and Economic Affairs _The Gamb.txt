In 1985, Minister of Finance Saikouba Sisay designed and implemented an Economic Recovery Programme. In 1992, a review of the Directorate of Customs commissioned by the Gambian government and performed by HM Customs and Excise found that the Gambian Minister of Finance granted duty waivers without sufficient acceptance guidelines, proper monitoring, or control of imports. In 1994, Minister of Finance Bakary B. Dabo was dismissed from the position because of his alleged involvement in the failed coup attempt of November 11.
