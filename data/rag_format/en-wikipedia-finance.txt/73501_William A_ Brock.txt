**William Allen** "**Buz**" **Brock** (born October 23, 1941) is a mathematical economist and a professor at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison since 1975. He is known for his application of a branch of mathematics known as chaos theory to economic theory and econometrics. In 1998, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in the Economics Section.

In a 1972 paper, co-authored with Leonard Mirman, Brock provided the first stochastic version of the neoclassical growth model, thereby paving the way for later developments such as real business cycle theory and DSGE models.
