Green Hydrogen Catapult


# Green Hydrogen Catapult



**Green Hydrogen Catapult** is a advocacy group focused on green hydrogen. Launched in 2020 by the United Nations, and supported by RMI, it agitates to bring the cost of green hydrogen (hydrogen produced using renewable power) below US$2 per kilogram (equivalent to $50 per megawatt hour) by 2026.

Although similar in objectives, the Green Hydrogen Catapult is unrelated to the Catapult centres of the United Kingdom.
