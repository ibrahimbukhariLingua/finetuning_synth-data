Diffusion (business)


# Diffusion (business)



In business, **diffusion** is the process by which a new idea or new product is accepted by the market. The **rate of diffusion** is the speed with which the new idea spreads from one consumer to the next. **Adoption** is the reciprocal process as viewed from a consumer perspective rather than distributor; it is similar to diffusion except that it deals with the psychological processes an individual goes through, rather than an aggregate market process.


## Theories

There are several theories that purport to explain the mechanics of diffusion:

* **The two-step hypothesis** – information and acceptance flows, via the media, first to opinion leaders, then to the general population
* **Trickle-down fashion** – products tend to be expensive at first, and therefore only accessible to the wealthy social strata – in time they become less expensive and are diffused to lower and lower strata.
* **The Everett Rogers Diffusion of innovations theory** – for any new idea, concept, product or method, there are five categories of adopters:
 + **Innovators** – venturesome, educated, multiple info sources;
 + **Early adopters** – social leaders, popular, educated;
 + **Early majority** – deliberate, many informal social contacts;
 + **Late majority** – skeptical, traditional, lower socio-economic status;
 + **Laggards** – neighbors and friends are main info sources, fear of debt.
* The Chasm model developed by Lee James and Warren Schirtzinger - Originally named The Marketing Chasm, this model overlays Everett Rogers' adoption curve with a gap between early adopters and the early majority. Chasm theory is only applicable to discontinuous innovations, which are those that impose a change of behavior, new learning, or a new process on the buyer or end user. And the pre-requisite for a chasm or gap to exist in the adoption lifecycle is the innovation must be discontinuous.
* **Technology driven models** – These are particularly relevant to software diffusion. The rate of acceptance of technology is determined by factors such as ease of use and usefulness.

## Rate

According to Everett M. Rogers, the rate of diffusion is influenced by:

* The product's perceived advantage or benefit.
* Riskiness of purchase.
* Ease of product use – complexity of the product.
* Immediacy of benefits.
* Observability.
* Trialability.
* Price.
* Extent of behavioral changes required.
* Return on investment in the case of industrial products.

### Models

There are several types of diffusion rate models:

1. **Penetration models** – use test market data to develop acceptance equations of expected sales volume as a function of time. Three examples of penetration models are:
 * Bass trial only model
 * Bass declining trial model
 * Fourt and Woodlock model
2. **Trial/Repeat models** – number of repeat buyers is a function of the number of trial buyers.
3. **Deterministic models** – assess number of buyers at various states of acceptance – later states are determined from calculations to previous states.
4. **Stochastic models** – recognize that many elements of the diffusion process are unknown but explicitly incorporate probabilistic terms.
