## OpenStreetMap Foundation 2018 elections incident

During the 2018 board elections of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, more than 100 individuals registered from the same IP address within a few hours. The signups were flagged immediately as suspicious but were not rejected by the OSMF board, because they were received after the deadline and so were not eligible to vote. Those voting to keep the memberships stated that there was no assumption of ill intent.

The OpenStreetMap Membership Working Group released a public report indicating a large group of signups from GlobalLogic.

GlobalLogic then offered to withdraw the memberships, and the OSMF board accepted the offer as resolution in February 2019.
