## History

**Monte di Pietà di Vicenza** was founded in 1486 as a mount of piety (Italian: *monte di pietà*), by Franciscan Marco da Montegallo in the Republic of Venice, 24 years after the first recorded mount of Italy was founded in Perugia, by other Franciscans, Bernardine of Feltre and Michele Carcano, in the Papal States. The Chiesa di San Vincenzo [it] was also owned by the mount.

In 1822 the mount also founded Cassa di Risparmio di Vicenza, the local savings bank of the city, at that time part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, in the Austrian Empire. It was closed in 1838 and re-open in 1913; in 1924 the savings bank was independent from the mount, but merged with Cassa di Risparmio di Verona in 1927−28.

In 1930s, the mount changed the name to **Monte di Credito su Pegno di Vicenza**, due to an enactment of a law regarding the denomination of the mounts of piety of Italy.
