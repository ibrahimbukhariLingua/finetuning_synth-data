## Obscenity charges

In 1988 he operated Consumer Marketing Group in Stamford, Connecticut, and Dirty Dick's Dynamite Discount Den as a distributor of pornographic materials. After being tried for obscenity charges, Freedberg accepted a plea bargain to pay $600,000 and promise to never deal in sexually explicit materials again.

### National Collectors Mint

In 1991 he founded the National Collectors Mint in Port Chester, New York. The company, through its online catalog and television advertisements, markets collectible and commemorative coins. In 2004, it began selling coins commemorating the September 11 attacks with silver purported to have been recovered from the World Trade Center. The coins, which it allegedly purported to be legal tender, are said to have been issued by the United States territory Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands which cannot issue legal tender. After the company paid a $750,000 settlement to the FTC for repeatedly and fraudulently marketing the coins, senator Chuck Schumer stated, "This settlement will assure consumers that we, as a nation, will not tolerate such a despicable scam."
