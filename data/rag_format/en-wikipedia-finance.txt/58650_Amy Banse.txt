She spent the early part of her career overseeing the development of Comcast's cable network portfolio, including the company's investments in E! Entertainment Television, The Golf Channel and VERSUS and the launch of G4, PBS KIDS Sprout, TV One and Comcast's sports networks.

While at Comcast in 2000, Banse invested $5 million into the Women's United Soccer Association, the world's first women's professional soccer league. The league was suspended in 2003 after reports of low television ratings and low attendance.

In 2005, Banse founded Comcast Interactive Media (CIM) and led the company's online strategy over the next six years, overseeing multiple acquisitions as well as the in-house development and management of Comcast.net, Xfinity.com and Xfinitytv.com, Fancast and Swirl.

At Comcast Ventures, Banse's portfolio includes Automat, Flipboard, Grokker, Houzz, Madison Reed, Quantifind, Tastemade, TuneIn, Nextdoor, and more.
