### Audience Knowledge

### Fund Manager Ratings

Citywire Fund Manager Ratings evaluate fund managers based on their performance across all the funds they manage over the past three years.

The methodology is purely quantitative, rewarding managers for superior risk-adjusted returns. The service judges fund managers on performance relative to a benchmark on the funds they run. Citywire chooses the benchmark, just in case the asset management group has chosen one it believes is not robust enough.

Fund Manager Ratings is an impartial service that provides ratings for all eligible managers globally, and no one can pay for a rating. Currently, around 15,000 active managers in 41 countries are rated.
