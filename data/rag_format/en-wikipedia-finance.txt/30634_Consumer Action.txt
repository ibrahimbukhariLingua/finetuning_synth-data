## Credit Card Survey

In June 1986, in collaboration with the Consumer Federation, Consumer Action introduced the *Consumer Action Credit Card Survey*, an annual survey of credit cards, banks, and lending practices. The survey has become well known for highlighting hidden practices of credit card vendors that are anti-consumer.

The annual survey has highlighted predatory lending practices; and has been used to gain the attention of lawmakers. Don Oldenburg, of *The Washington Post* sites the highlighting of questionable lending and payment practices as one of the resources used for Congress and federal bank regulators to these questionable and costly practices.

> Congress, a House bill called "The Consumer Credit Card Protection Act" would prohibit arbitrary universal default penalties. Another bill, "The Loan Shark Prevention Act," would establish a fair cap on credit card interest rates.

The survey has been quoted and used local and national sources, such as *Smart Money*, *CNN Money*, and *The New York Times*.
