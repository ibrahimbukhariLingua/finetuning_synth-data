## History

The company started in 1946 when Bill Zimmer and his wife, Roberta, bought a small downtown jewelry store in Wilmington, North Carolina and changed the name to Reeds Jewelers. Later, Reeds opened a store in Whiteville, Jacksonville, and other cities in both North and South Carolina. Bill Zimmer built Reeds' business on the foundation of customer service and respect, which he deemed the Reeds Promise. He would often tell his associates: "The most important thing I've learned is that you never argue with a customer. You've just got to do right by people." He carried that philosophy into his treatment of employees, vendors and customers alike, stating that his priorities were to "treat all my people like I'd want to be treated, I respect them and I let them know they were loved and appreciated." By 1979, Reeds Jewelers maintained two dozen retail outlets. Alan Zimmer joined Reeds Jewelers as executive vice president in 1981 and took charge of merchandising. He officially became president and CEO in 1985.

In December 1986 Reeds Jewelers held its initial public offering on The NASDAQ Stock Market, trading under the symbol REEDS. Over the next decade Reeds acquired Dreifus Jewelry Company of Memphis, a nineteen store chain in the Southeast and Midwest, and Gray's Jewelers, Inc., a five store chain based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1995 Reeds Jewelers purchased Melart Jewelers, a mid-Atlantic based jeweler operating stores in Maryland, DC, and Pennsylvania. In 1998 Reeds Jewelers moved to the American Stock Exchange and traded using the symbol RJI.

In February 2004 the company returned to private ownership by the Zimmer family, making it one of the largest family owned jeweler in America. In 2014, Reeds announced the acceptance of Bitcoin, a digital currency, in-store and online at reeds.com. Reeds Jewelers is the first fine jeweler to accept bitcoin.
