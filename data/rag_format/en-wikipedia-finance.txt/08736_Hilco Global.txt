## History

Hilco Global was founded in 1987 by Jeff Hecktman. Hecktman founded Hilco Trading Company after restructuring his family's industrial supply firm and selling off many of the business' under performing assets. Hilco Global was renamed in 2013, eliminating the use of the name Hilco Trading Company as well as introducing a new logo and website for the company.

Hilco Global began drawing attention from major investors in 2006 when it was announced that Goldman Sachs Group and Cerberus Capital Management were in talks to purchase a significant stake in the company. Hecktman sold part of the company to both investment companies to help finance other ventures, including private equity style buyouts of faded consumer brands. In 2019, Hilco Global sold 27% of itself to La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), a company which manages public Canadian pension and insurance funds. In May 2019, Hilco subsidiary H19 Capital acquired the assets of 19th Capital Group, an Indianapolis transportation and truck leasing company.


### Hilco Merchant Resources / Hilco Consumer - Retail

In 2000, Hilco Global founded a business division named Hilco Merchant Resources LLC, a subsidiary of the company that specializes in retail inventory valuation, retail store closings, retail inventory disposition, fixture, furniture, and equipment disposition, and asset protection. Michael Keefe and Cory Lipoff, formerly of Gordon Brothers, joined HMR the same year with Keefe becoming the CEO. In 2001, the division became known as one of the top five liquidation firms in the United States, having been involved in the $1.8 billion liquidation of Montgomery Ward following that company's bankruptcy. Some of its most notable disposition and liquidation deals included work for Sears, Sears Canada, CompUSA, Sportmart, PharMor Rx, Coldwater Creek, Charming Charlie, and Target Canada. In 2016, the division helped save Aéropostale from final liquidation, eventually allowing the retailer to restructure and reopen over 500 stores. As Toys "R" Us stores closed in 2018, Hilco Merchant Resources oversaw the nearly $2 billion liquidation of their inventory and assets. Hilco Merchant Resources also expanded its operations by opening an office in Australia, taking on retail inventory liquidations of stores that include Fletcher Jones, Dubbo Everyday Living and Dick Smith.
