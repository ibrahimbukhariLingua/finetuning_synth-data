Competitive Alternatives


# Competitive Alternatives



KPMG's **Competitive Alternatives** is a biennial guide to comparing international business site locations in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The primary focus of the study is international business costs. The study measures the impact of significant costs that vary by location, as applied to different business operations. Demand for the guide has grown significantly since it was first introduced in 1996. The founding study compared 23 cities in 7 business operations in Canada and the United States. In 2010, the analysis included 112 cities in 17 business operations in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

In the 2010 edition, the study measured the combined impact of 26 significant cost components that were most likely to vary by location, as applied to 17 different business operations over 10 years. The study also compares a variety of non-cost factors that also influence the relative attractiveness of locations to business; aspects considered by the 2010 study included labour availability and skills, economic conditions and markets, innovation, infrastructure, and regulatory environment, as well as personal cost of living and quality of life.
