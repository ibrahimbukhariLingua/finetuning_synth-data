## History


### Origins

Founded by Takao Yasuda, Don Quijote opened its first store in Suginami, Tokyo in September 1980 under its original name, Just Co. Originally a retail store, Just Co. quickly switched to wholesale in 1982.

The company opened its first "Don Quijote" named store in Fuchu, Tokyo in March 1989. With the name change, the store also changed its primary business from wholesale to retail. It was not until 1995, six years later, that Just Co. followed suit and it changed its corporate name to Don Quijote Co., Ltd as well. In June 1998, the company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

As one of the leading discount stores in Japan, the end of the Japanese economic bubble didn't severely affect the company. Instead, the sudden economic uncertainty caused the Japanese public to become more thrifty and therefore helped to boost sales at its stores during the early 1990s.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2005, idol group AKB48 opened its theater on the eighth floor of the Don Quijote Akihabara Outlet in Tokyo. Also that year, a Ferris wheel opened at the facade of the Don Quijote Dōtonbori branch in Osaka.

In October 2007, Don Quijote purchased the ailing *Nagasakiya* chain for 140 billion yen. This store and 3 other group companies went defunct in Oct 2017 as creditors have pulled the plug on their combined 432 billion yen of debts. Creditors continue to bankroll the rest of the group.

On June 28, 2017, PAQ, which operated Honolulu-based Times, Big Save and Shima, under the subsidiary QSI, Inc., announced that it had sold the 24 stores it owns in Hawaii to Honolulu-based Don Quijote (USA), using an executed stock purchase agreement with the sale closing in the 3rd quarter of 2017. The deal will combine Times with three Don Quijote stores and two Marukai stores on Oahu. In a statement from Edwin Sawai, president of Don Quijote (USA) Co., Ltd. and Marukai Hawaii Co. Ltd., he said that “The opportunity to welcome the Times Supermarket family of stores and their employees to our ohana is exciting for us,” and added that “We are confident that we will successfully work together, share ideas and learn from each other's combined experiences to best serve Hawaii. For more than 68 years, Times Supermarket has been a local favorite and pillar of Hawaii's retail community. We look forward to continuing their history and success in the islands.”

## Mascot

The official character mascot of Don Quijote is called Donpen (ドンペン). Introduced in 1998, he is depicted as a blue penguin wearing a Santa hat and the Katakana character "do" (ド) on his stomach. For the international Don Don Donki branches, the "do" is replaced with the letter D. The company also has a female equivalent known as Donko (ドンコ), who is colored pink with a heart on her stomach.

In December 2022, Don Quijote invited controversy when it announced Donpen would be replaced by an anthropomorphic depiction of the Katakana character "do" named Dojou-chan. The decision was reversed days later after an outpouring of support for the mascot on social media.


## Theme song

Don Quijote's theme song is "Miracle Shopping [ja]", sung by Maimi Tanaka [ja], a former Don Quijote store employee. The song was later released as a maxi single in 1999 by Grace Notes Records [ja]. An English and Cantonese version has also been released. The english version is sung by Maimi Tanaka. Both versions also have a remake under the "Don Don Donki" name to accommodate for the outlets outside Japan.

The song has been described as "Catchy but annoying" and "highly repetitious but smartly done so". These quotes could be referring to the fact that the song has been specifically designed to be catchy and stick around in your head so that it constantly reminds you of the store.

The song's popularity is somewhat high. It has more than a million plays on Spotify. The song's popularity has made it the subject of remakes and alternative versions, including lo-fi remixes and a remix in which someone edited clips of Donald Trump to make it seem like he is singing the song.


## Commercial endorsements and collaborations

In August 2024, American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars collaborated with the store chain, appearing in the latest commercial ad. Mars, dancers Miyu, Haruka, Miyuri and Miku, and the store's mascot Donpen, dance around the Mega Don Quijote store situated in Shibuya, while picking up articles from the store's "People Brand 'Jōnetsu kakaku'" brand. Mars wrote the jingle and produced the commercial for the "Donki Ikuyo" (ドンキイクヨ, lit. "Let's Go to Donki") campaign. Besides the commercial, the Mars-Don Quijote collaboration included several exclusive goods released for a limited time in September. Mars shared the commercial in a reel on his Instagram account.


## Incidents


### Arson

In December 2004, four stores in the Kantō area were damaged or destroyed by arson attacks. Three store employees, Morio Oshima, 39, Mai Koishi, 20, and Maiko Sekiguchi, 19, died in the first arson incident. In 2007, Noriko Watanabe, 49, was found guilty of setting the fires and sentenced to life imprisonment. Don Quijote received harsh criticism at the time for poor store layout that made it difficult to find exits.


### Roller coaster

In 2005, Don Quijote began building a "half-pipe" roller coaster on the roof of its eight-storey Roppongi store. Roppongi is a heavily populated area in the core of Tokyo, and many residents and businesses were upset with the idea of having a roller coaster in their neighborhood because of the spectacle, noise and crowds it would likely create. The project was completed in 2006 but due to increasing pressure from concerned groups in the area it was never operated. As of 2019, the structure had been removed.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Overseas assets

Don Quijote purchased the Marukai Japanese chain stores in the United States in 2013, splitting it into Marukai and Tokyo Central Markets chains.


## In popular culture

Don Quijote stores are included as in-game shops in the Yakuza video game series. In 2009, Sega partnered with the store to advertise the release of *Yakuza 3*.

There is a Don Quijote store scene in *TONIKAWA: Over the Moon to You* when Nasa and Tsukasa went shopping in its second episode of its first season.
