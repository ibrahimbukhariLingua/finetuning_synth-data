## Fan Tokens


### Background

Fan tokens are digital coins created on the Chiliz blockchain that sports organisations provide to users via the app Socios.com. This app allows users to vote on a variety of minor decisions, such as new facilities, kit designs, shirt numbers of new signings, celebration songs, and more. Fan Tokens were first introduced in 2019, with football clubs Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain being the first clubs to launch their official tokens. Sports clubs including Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Manchester City, Inter, Arsenal, AS Roma, Galatasaray, Flamengo, Corinthians and 60 other teams have launched Fan Tokens through Socios.com.
