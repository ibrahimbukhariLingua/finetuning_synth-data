National Association for Business Economics


# National Association for Business Economics



The **National Association for Business Economics** (**NABE**) is the largest international association of applied economists, strategists, academics, and policy-makers committed to the application of economics. Founded in 1959, it is one of the member organizations of the Allied Social Science Associations. According to the association's website, "NABE's mission is to provide leadership in the use and understanding of economics.".

NABE was holding its annual conference at the Marriott World Trade Center hotel during the 9/11 attacks.

The association's membership is divided into subject-oriented subdivisions or round tables, including: financial, health economics, international, manufacturing, real estate/construction, regional/utility, small business/entrepreneurship, technology, and transfer pricing. Each round table plans and executes webinars and sessions at NABE meetings each year. NABE also has local and student chapters in many cities and much of the United States.
