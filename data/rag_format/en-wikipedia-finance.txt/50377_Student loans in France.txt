Student loans in France


# Student loans in France



**Student loans** and grants **in France** are primarily provided by the government through the Centre régional des œuvres universitaires et scolaires (CROUS), and Établissement public à caractère administratif. The CROUS is responsible for Student Finance France. Most undergraduate university students resident in France are eligible for student loans.fr


## Eligibility

Grants are provided based on family or individual resources. Most students are entitled to a mínimum grant.


### Tuition fees

Any student receiving a state grant is automatically entitled to 100% reduction in Tuition Fees at state universities.


### Means tested higher education grants (bourses d'enseignement supérieur sur critères sociaux)

This type of grant is targeted at those whose parents have low revenues. The eligibility is weighted taking into account, distance to the family residence, number of siblings studying, if the student is handicapped and if the student is married or in a legal partnership. If the student is not entitled to a higher weighting due to any of the criteria and family revenue is above 33150 euros/year (in 2014) then the minimum grant will be paid out (€1000). The maximum grant (€550/month) is only payable if a family has no revenue or achieves the highest rating and has a revenue of under 21500 euros/year
Approximately 30% of students are entitled to a means tested grant
