Grigorishin spent a week in detention and after then the charges were withdrawn. After being released, Grigorishin accused Surkis and Viktor Medvedchuk in organization of said provocative act. Being concerned about his and his family's safety, Grigorishin claimed he had to leave Ukraine and temporary moved to Moscow. According to Grigorishin's words, that all led to necessity, as a countermeasure to protect his business, to engage in politics and support opposition.

On 10 November 2016, the District Court of Gudermes awarded Grigorishin to pay 230 mln USD. Subsequently, in October 2017 this decision was upheld by the order of the High Court of Chechen Republic, after which enforcement proceedings were commenced. In December 2017, bailiffs accompanied by the representatives of Khasan Ediev arrived at apartments and house in Moscow owned by Konstantin Grigorishin with the aim to organize eviction of said real estate and movable property located there.
