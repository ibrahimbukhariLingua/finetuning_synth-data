## History

PSECU was started in 1934 by 22 state employees who pooled $90 in assets to found the credit union and provide better lives for their families.

In 2022, PSECU was named as the Best-In-State credit union for the fourth year by *Forbes*. That same year, PSECU's president and chief executive officer, George Rudolph, was named to the Banking & Finance Power List. PSECU's management philosophy in 2022 was described, in part, by Barb Bowker, PSECU's chief member experience officer, as follows: "Tapping into someone’s emotions — giving them a truly great experience as a member — is what builds loyalty and helps retain members for a lifetime."
