# OurCrowd



**OurCrowd** is an online global venture investing platform that empowers institutions and individual accredited investors to invest and engage in emerging technology companies at an early stage while still privately held. Based in Jerusalem, the company launched in February 2013, and has since opened overseas branches in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Spain, Singapore, Brazil, and the UAE.

As of November 2022, OurCrowd has over 200,000 registered members and has received over US$2 billion in commitments. OurCrowd uses equity crowdfunding as its model. In equity crowdfunding, investments into a company's shares are pooled together from the crowd. OurCrowd allows each investor to choose the individual companies in which to invest. Investing in OurCrowd is available only to accredited investors, allowing them to choose in which portfolio companies and funds to co-invest in with a minimum of $10,000 in companies or $50,000 in funds. Our Crowd requires its Israeli portfolio companies to donate a portion of their equity to charity as part of the closing of any funding round.

Pitchbook has rated OurCrowd "Israel's most active VC fund" for the tenth consecutive year. OurCrowd invests its capital in all the companies and venture funds offered on its platform, and extends the opportunity to invest to its accredited membership on the same terms.

As of November 2022, OurCrowd has had over 60 exits, including stock market listings like Beyond Meat, Lemonade, Innoviz and Hub Security. In addition to the exits, there were high-profile acquisitions including CyberX by Microsoft.
