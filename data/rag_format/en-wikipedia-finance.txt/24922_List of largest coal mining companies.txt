# List of largest coal mining companies



The largest coal mining companies of the world are found in several countries, the most prominent among them being the United States, Australia, India and China. Unlike the article on the List of largest mining companies by revenue, this article focuses solely on coal mining companies and deliberately avoids listing companies that mine Gold, Silver or Platinum. This article also avoid listing companies like Glencore or Trafigura which are essentially trading companies or holding companies; they are not actual mining companies.
