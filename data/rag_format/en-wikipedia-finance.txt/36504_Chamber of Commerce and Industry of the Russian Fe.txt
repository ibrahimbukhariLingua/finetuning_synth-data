# Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation



The **Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation** (RF CCI, Russian: Торгово-промышленная палата Российской Федерации, ТПП РФ) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization that operates under the Russian Federation Law on Chambers of Commerce and Industry in the Russian Federation and the Chamber's Charter and represents the interests of small, medium-size, and big businesses encompassing all business sectors—manufacturing, domestic and foreign trade, agriculture, the finance system, and the services. Chaired by Sergey Katyrin.


## Mission

The Chamber formulates its mission as to “promote the growth of the Russian economy and its integration into the world economic system and provide favorable conditions for the advancement of all business sectors.”


## History

In March 1910 a bill on the introduction of chambers of commerce and industry in Russia was drawn up, but the statute "On chambers of commerce and industry" was approved only on October 6, 1917 by the Russian Provisional Government. The document outlined principal goals, tasks and authority of chambers of commerce and industry in Russia.

After the end of the Russian Civil War and a transfer to the New Economic Policy (NEP), on November 11, 1921 the North-Western Chamber was incorporated in Petrograd. In December 1922, the Eastern Chamber of Commerce began its operations in the Soviet republics Bukhara and Khorezm.

On May 28, 1932 the USSR Council of People's Commissars approved the Charter of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce. The AUCC was headquartered in Moscow. In 1972 it became the USSR Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In 1988 the USSR CCI congress approved opening regional and municipal affiliations. That was when the foundation of the present-day Russia's CCI network was laid down.

19 regional chambers of commerce and industry and several dozens of associations of entrepreneurs participated in the foundation congress of the CCI of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in October 1991.

On March 18, 1993 RF president signed the decree "On the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation." It was later updated and constitutionalized as the RF Law "On Chambers of Commerce and Industry in the Russian Federation."
