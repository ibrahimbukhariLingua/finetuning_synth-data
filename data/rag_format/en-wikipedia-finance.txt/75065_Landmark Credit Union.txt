Landmark Credit Union


# Landmark Credit Union



**Landmark Credit Union** is an American credit union providing banking services in Southern Wisconsin. It operates as a cooperative and is owned by its members. Landmark provides banking services including, savings accounts, checking accounts, mortgages and investments.


## History

In February 1933, a group of employees at Rex Chainbelt Company (later Rexnord Corporation) pooled their funds together to form Rex #2 Credit Union to provide financial services to Rex Chainbelt Company employees.

Over the years, the credit union changed names (Chabelco Credit Union, Rexnord Credit Union). Then, in 1985, the credit union extended its scope to people living or working within the greater Milwaukee area. This event prompted the name change to Landmark Credit Union.

Landmark has grown to more than 30 branches and has over $5 billion in total assets. It serves those who live and work in Southern and Northeastern Wisconsin, plus Lake and McHenry Counties in Illinois.
