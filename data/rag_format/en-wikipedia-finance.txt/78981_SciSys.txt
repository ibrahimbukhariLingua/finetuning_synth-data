## History

SCISYS was formed in 1980 as **Science Systems** and its shares were listed on London's Alternative Investment Market in 1997.

In 2000, Science Systems acquired CODA, an accounting software company, and in 2002 the group holding company was renamed **CODASciSys plc**. The CODA business was demerged as a separately listed company in 2006. Following the demerger, the original, remaining business became SciSys plc in 2006.

In 2007, SciSys purchased a private Bochum-based German company, VCS AG. VCS produced software, computer systems and telecommunications systems for broadcasting, and services for public- and private-sector satellites.

In January 2012 the VCS business was renamed SCISYS Deutschland GmbH as part of a wider integration exercise. As part of this, in May 2012, the UK operations of SciSys were also rebranded as SCISYS. These two changes brought the business divisions together, operating under the same name and branding.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2018, SCISYS moved its headquarters to Ireland, which was seen as a response to the then-pending Brexit.

In December 2019, SCISYS was acquired by CGI, an independent IT and business consulting services firm.
