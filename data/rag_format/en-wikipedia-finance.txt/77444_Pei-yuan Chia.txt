## Personal life

Chia was born in Hong Kong. His father Dewey Teh-huai Chia (賈德懷; 1912–1998), the second son of Republic of China Ministry of Finance official Chia Shih-yi [zh], was prominent in Shanghai's finance industry. His mother Kitty Shun-hua Chin Chia (秦舜華; 1916–2016), a daughter of educationalist Chin Fen [zh], was a graduate of Yenching University. Chia's parents had moved to Hong Kong the year before his birth, and then the family moved again to Taiwan in 1951. His parents eventually settled in the United States in 1956, where his father started a maritime transport company and his mother worked as a statistician in the United Nations Secretariat. Chia himself remained in Taiwan for his education, attending Jianguo Middle School in Taipei and going on to graduate from Tunghai University in Taichung with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1961. He then joined his family in the U.S., where he earned an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1964. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1970.

Chia was married to Frances T.C. Yen Chia (嚴雋荃), a classmate of his at Tunghai University and a daughter of former President of the Republic of China Yen Chia-kan, from 1965 until her death in 2003. He had three children with her: Douglas, a lawyer; Katherine, an architect; and Candice. He remarried in 2005 to his high school sweetheart Katherine "Kitty" Shen (沈君玉).

To commemorate Frances' life, Chia endowed a garden in front of the women's dormitory at Tunghai University, which opened in November 2006. He also established an endowed professorship in marketing, the Frances and Pei-Yuan Chia Professorship, at the University of Pennsylvania; it has been held by Peter Fader since 2003. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Tunghai University in 2007.
