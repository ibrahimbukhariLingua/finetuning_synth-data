Certified medical reimbursement specialist


# Certified medical reimbursement specialist



**Certified Medical Reimbursement Specialist** (CMRS) is a voluntary national credential that was created specifically for the medical billing professional. The American Medical Billing Association (AMBA) has been providing this industry certification and designation for nearly a decade.

The CMRS designation is awarded by the Certifying Board of the American Medical Billing Association (CBAMBA) after an exam. Although there is no state or federal requirement for a medical billing professional to become certified to practice medical billing, the goal is to provide a professional certification that upholds a high ethical standard of knowledge that recognizes the competency of a certificant.


## Composition of the exam

The exam is composed of 16 sections:

1. Medical Terminology
2. Anatomy & Physiology
3. Information Technology
4. Web & Information Technology
5. ICD-10 Coding

## Exam textbooks

The current year's HCPCS, CPT-4, and ICD-10 Code Books are needed to take the exam, or you can use a free trial of the AMBA's coding software.

The AMBA offers a CMRS Study Guide. Purchasing the guide is optional but recommended because 80% of the exam is taken from the study guide.

A small portion (5%) of the answers to the CMRS exam can be found in the book *Understanding Health Insurance*. There are 150 sample questions from the exam in the Workbook, and the answers are in the Instructor's Manual (both sold separately).
