## Research

Mushfiq Mobarak's research interests include development economics, behavioural economics, environmental economics and migration. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he belongs to the top 7% of most cited economists. Key findings of his research include:

* that, as people become richer, the risk of sustaining damages due to flooding, landslides and windstorms tends to increase up to a certain threshold and decrease only thereafter, implying that governments in developing countries may need to be particularly proactive to mitigate their citizens' exposure to disaster risk (with Derek K. Kellenberg);
* that political democratization and economic diversification reduce volatility, and thereby contribute to sustain economic growth;
* that the likelihood of commuting to work by car decreases as urban population concentration and the availability of public transport increase and road are more sparse, suggesting that optimising the spatial structure of cities could significantly reduce commutation (with Antonio M. Bento, Maureen L. Cropper and Katja Vinha).
