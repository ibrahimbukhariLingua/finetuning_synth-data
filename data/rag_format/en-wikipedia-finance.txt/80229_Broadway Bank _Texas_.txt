## History

Founded as "Broadway National Bank of Alamo Heights" in 1941 by Col. Charles E. Cheever Sr., and his wife, Elizabeth Cheever.

In the late 1950s, Charles Sr. and Elizabeth's son, Charlie Cheever Jr., stepped into the family business. Under his 50-year leadership, Broadway Bank was the first to establish a mortgage lending division (1959), extend banking hours to help working families, offer 24-hour ATMs and open a full-service neighborhood customer convenience center.

In 1983, the bank was the city’s first to offer on-site brokerage services.

In 1984, the bank began to offer a Wealth Management Division.

In 1996, Broadway Bank acquired Financial Centers in Fredericksburg, Kerrville, Boerne, Castroville, Hondo, and Seguin, Texas.

Cheever Junior’s son-in-law, James D. Goudge, became CEO in 1998. Goudge joined Broadway Bank as executive vice president of commercial banking in 1989 and ascended to chairman in 2001. Goudge was also inducted into the Texas Bankers Hall of Fame in 2023.

In 2005, the bank acquired Balcones Bank with Financial Centers in San Marcos, Wimberley, Kyle and Buda starting its move northward. Broadway Bank added Financial Centers in Bee Cave and Dripping Springs in 2010. In 2013, Broadway Bank announced its entry into the Austin region and today serves the mid-town and Round Rock areas.

In April 2016, Broadway Bank announced the appointment of David Bohne as its new chief executive officer. Bohne replaced longtime CEO Jim Goudge.

In 2018, Broadway Bank was the winner of the large division for the San Antonio Express News' Top Workplaces list. Broadway Bank CEO David Bohne attributed the bank's success to its employees. Broadway Bank redid its employee benefits program in 2017 — moving away from traditional benefits to more flexible benefits. Among the benefits the bank added is “100 percent company paid short-term disability” and a parental leave program that offers up to eight weeks of paid time off for employees who have a new addition to the family — whether by childbirth or adoption. It has moved away from a “traditional way of doing profit-sharing” to a “more market competitive bonus program. The new bonus program allows employees to choose either to contribute to their 401(k) and receive a company match (up to IRS and plan limits), or be paid in cash. Employees can also choose a combination of the two. The bank also offers mentoring and leadership programs for employees. Broadway Bank officials credit the new benefit and pay programs and other changes for helping it earn the Top Workplaces honor for large employers with at least 500 workers. It beat out 13 other companies. It’s the second straight year it has made the list.

In 2020, Broadway Bank introduced a new brand throughout the bank’s digital and physical footprint. Broadway Bank Financial Centers were rebranded and renovated with open layouts, digital screens and new signage.

In 2021 and 2022, Broadway expanded into the regions of Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston.

In 2023, Broadway Bank ranked #1 in the Extra-Large company category in the San Antonio Business Journal’s 2023 Best Places to Work list.
