## Organization

Caruna includes two separate network companies. Caruna Espoo Oy operates in urban areas with a high cabling rate and a high number of customers to share the expenses per metres of network. Caruna Oy operates mainly in rural, sparsely populated, areas where their amount of network to be maintained, built and repaired is high. The length of the network is 168 metres per customer in Caruna Oy's area. In Caruna Espoo Oy's area, the corresponding number is 36 metres per customer.

Caruna was founded in 2014, but its story really began in 1912 in a place called Karuna where a new electricity company started out. Caruna has approximately 300 employees and contracts 1,000 additional workers across Finland. Caruna's operations are regulated by the Finnish Energy Authority, in charge of monitoring the electricity network business in Finland.

Caruna is owned by Finnish employment pension companies Elo (7.5%), as well as international infrastructure investors KKR (40%), OTPP (40%) and AMF (12,5%).
