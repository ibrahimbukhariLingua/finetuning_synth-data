## History

The startup was founded in 2000 by Egyptian techpreneur Amr Shady. TA telecom expanded from its headquarters in Egypt to Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Libya, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Rwanda, and Morocco.
It started as a mobile advertising provider and provided value-added services (VAS) a year later in 2001. Value-added services are phone services that users can receive in addition to their core voice calls (e.g., ring back tones, daily news summaries that are automatically sent to users by SMS, etc.).
The company moved into developing mobile applications and predictive analytics in 2012.
TA telecom grew between 2006 and 2013. It began with a small client base in Egypt, but its products now reach around 10 million users in the Middle East and Africa (MENA). The company's employees increased from 15 in 2006 to 65 in 2015. Its revenue also grew by 560% from 2009 to 2014.
