Marketplace (radio program)


# Marketplace (radio program)



***Marketplace*** is an American radio program that focuses on business, the economy, and events that influence them. The program was first broadcast on January 2, 1989. Hosted by Kai Ryssdal since 2005, the show is produced and distributed by American Public Media. Marketplace is produced in Los Angeles with bureaus in New York, Washington, D.C., Portland, Baltimore, London, and Shanghai. It won a Peabody Award in 2000.

Besides the flagship daytime half-hour program, Marketplace also produces a companion show, the seven-and-a-half-minute-long *Marketplace Morning Report*, hosted by David Brancaccio, which airs on many public radio stations during the last segment of the NPR program *Morning Edition*. The Marketplace team produces a number of podcasts, including *Make Me Smart*, *This Is Uncomfortable, The Uncertain Hour, How We Survive*, and *Million Bazillion*, as well as podcast versions of the radio broadcast and extended podcasts built around regular segments from the radio show.


## History

*Marketplace* was founded in 1989 by James Russell in Long Beach, California. It was initially affiliated with KLON-FM at Cal State—Long Beach and distributed by American Public Radio, later renamed Public Radio International. The show nearly ran out of funding its first year, which Russell described, saying, "We were within three days of laying off our small staff and closing down." The program survived through the help of the University of Southern California (USC), which acquired the show, and later, in 1990, with the underwriting of General Electric. USC became the only university in the U.S. at the time to produce a daily news program distributed nationally.

In 2000, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) acquired Marketplace Productions from USC. This acquisition was the subject of a lawsuit by Public Radio International, which said it had not given its contractually required approval for the sale.

In 2004, American Public Media was founded as the production and distribution arm of MPR, and is currently the producer and distributor of *Marketplace*.


## Demographics

As of 2014, *Marketplace*'s programs reached upwards of 12 million listeners with an average income of $101,000.


## Companion programs


### *Marketplace Morning Report*

The *Marketplace Morning Report* is a seven-minute, thirty-second broadcasts that replace the business news-oriented "E" segment of NPR's *Morning Edition* on subscribing public radio stations. The show has been hosted by David Brancaccio since 2013. There are seven feeds of the *Marketplace Morning Report* from 5:51:30 a.m. ET to 11:51:30 a.m. ET, updated as news develops.

Because of the popularity of the *Marketplace Morning Report*, NPR struck a deal with APM to incorporate the segment into the second hour of *Morning Edition*, bringing the segment to all listeners, even if the station doesn't subscribe to *Marketplace*.


### Podcasts

All two radio programs, *Marketplace*, and *Marketplace Morning Report*, are made available as free podcasts. In 2015, *Marketplace* began to offer non-broadcast-only podcasts: *Actuality* (2015–2016 with Quartz), *Codebreaker*, and *Corner Office*. In 2016, *The Uncertain Hour* and *Make Me Smart* were added.

Marketplace currently produces the following podcasts: *Make Me Smart,* hosted by Kimberly Adams and Kai Ryssdal; *The Uncertain Hour,* hosted by Krissy Clark; *This Is Uncomfortable*, hosted by Reema Khrais; *Million Bazillion,* hosted by Bridget Bodnar and Ryan Perez; and *How We Survive.*


### Discontinued programs

The *Marketplace* brand also took over the money advice program *Sound Money*, which was renamed *Marketplace Money* in 2005, with content oriented toward a personal finance theme. The three shows share reporters and editorial staff. *Marketplace Money* was replaced with *Marketplace Weekend* in June 2014. *Marketplace Weekend* was cancelled in 2018. The *Marketplace Minute Morning Brief* was cancelled on June 30, 2023. The remaining *Marketplace Minute* programs (*Marketplace Minute Midday* and *Marketplace Minute Closing Bell*) were cancelled on July 12, 2024.
