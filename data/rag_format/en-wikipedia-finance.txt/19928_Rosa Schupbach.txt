Her father, Florian Lechner, was born in Vienna, Austria, and had been trained as a butcher. Her mother was a maid hailing from the Black Forest in Germany. In 1918, they would open their own modest restaurant, and a few years later expand with buying a neighboring butchery. In 1924, they became Swiss citizens. In 1936, Florian decided to retire and enjoy life more with his family, this was possible through the wealth he accumulated through several income streams.

## Personal life

During her time in London, she met Mehdi Tajbakhsh, originally from Iran, who studied agronomy. After a few years of courtship, they decided to go to her native, where he would continue his studies at the Agricultural School Strickhof in Zürich. Ultimately, they were married at Zurich Town Hall, in a small civilian ceremony, in 1952. Her father declined to attend the ceremony and disapproved in her choice to marry a foreigner from the Middle East.

Ultimately, she had to relinquish her Swiss citizenship, and in return received Iranian citizenship and permanent residency status.
