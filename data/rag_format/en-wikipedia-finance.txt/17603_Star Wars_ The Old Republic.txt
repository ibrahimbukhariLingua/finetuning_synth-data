Star Wars: The Old Republic


# Star Wars: The Old Republic



***Star Wars: The Old Republic*** is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) based in the *Star Wars* universe. Developed by BioWare Austin and a supplemental team at BioWare Edmonton, the game was announced on October 21, 2008. The video game was released for the Microsoft Windows platform on December 20, 2011 in North America and part of Europe. It was released in Oceania and Asia on March 1, 2012.

This story takes place in the *Star Wars* universe shortly after the establishment of a tenuous peace between the re-emergent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic. The game features eight different classes. Each of the eight classes has a three act storyline that progresses as the character levels up. Players join either the Republic or the Sith, but players may possess a morality at any point along the light/dark spectrum. Different classes favor different styles of gameplay, and the game features extensive customization options, fully voiced dialogue, companion characters, and dialogue options similar to BioWare's other role-playing games.

Although not officially disclosed, based on estimates, it is one of the most developmentally expensive games made. The game had one million subscribers within three days of its launch, making it the world's "fastest-growing MMO ever"; however, in the following months the game lost a fair share of its subscriptions, but has remained profitable. The game has since adopted the hybrid free-to-play business model with remaining subscription option. The game was met with positive reception upon release and has received several updates and expansion packs. Several books and comics based on the game have been released. It is estimated that the game made $139 million in additional revenues on top of the subscription income in 2013. In an earnings call to investors in October 2019, Electronic Arts announced that *Star Wars: The Old Republic* was closing in on a billion dollars in lifetime revenue, making it a financial success based on the reported $200 million development budget.


## Plot

This story takes place in the *Star Wars* fictional universe shortly after the establishment of a tenuous peace between the re-emergent Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, 300 years after the events of the *Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic* games, and more than 3,600 years before the events in the *Star Wars* films.

The Jedi are held responsible for the success of the Sith during the devastating 28-year-long Great Galactic War (which led to the Treaty of Coruscant prior to the "cold war"), and thus choose to relocate from Coruscant to Tython, where the Jedi Order had initially been founded, to seek guidance from the Force. The Sith control Korriban, where they have re-established a Sith Academy. The game's "Return" cinematic trailer depicts the events where Korriban is re-conquered by the Sith.

During these events, a smuggler named Nico Okarr is led to his prison cell in a jail orbiting Korriban by a Jedi, Satele Shan, and her master, Kao Cen Darach. Suddenly, a Sith named Darth Malgus, and his master Vindican, along with several Sith troops, attack the base. Satele, a trooper named Jace Malcom, and Okarr escape the attack, but Darach is cut down by Malgus. Malgus then kills Vindican, who was wounded by Darach.

Ten years later, new conflicts have arisen. In the "Hope" cinematic trailer, Satele and some troops destroy a Sith party that includes Malgus. Malcom, who has become the troop's commander, states that, despite the losses, there is still hope amongst even "a single spark of courage". Later in the "Deceived" cinematic trailer, however, Malgus, having appeared to survive the earlier attack albeit with a mask covering his nose and mouth, leads an army of Sith into the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, killing many Jedi including the Jedi Master Ven Zallow.

Master Satele Shan is named the new Jedi Grand Master. The game itself is set in the cold-war soon after these events, with the Jedi Order and Galactic Republic struggling to maintain their control of the core worlds while the Sith plot their downfall and the expansion of the Sith Empire. The conflict opens on many fronts and across many planets, while native factions are engaged in political struggles or civil war.

BioWare stated, prior to release, that the game would have a significant focus on the storyline. Each of the eight classes has a three act storyline that progresses as the character levels up. A collaborative effort between BioWare, Lucasfilm Games, EA, and Dark Horse Comics has resulted in webcomics entitled *Star Wars: The Old Republic – Threat of Peace* and *Star Wars: The Old Republic – Blood of the Empire*, the purpose of which is to establish the backstory as the game opens and closes.


## Gameplay

Players join as members of either of the two main factions – the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Although each faction is led by a benevolent or malevolent leader, it is emphasized that an individual member may possess a morality at any point along the light/dark spectrum. The project's key focus is to differentiate between the player's faction and morality. For instance, a member with ties to the Sith Empire following the lightside while attempting to achieve their own ends, which may be misaligned or different from a sith's vision.

Player advancement occurs by a combination of mission completion, exploration, and defeating enemies. New skills, unlocked by level, are taught by trainers and can be learned in game at a multitude of locations. Heroic missions exist that require the cooperation of multiple players to complete objectives, and can be repeated normally on a daily basis.

While each class in *The Old Republic* favors a certain play style (ranged/melee damage, healing or support skills, or tanking), customization combined with companion characters allow for a class to be able to tackle many different situations, with or without the support of other player characters, and without requiring specific other classes in order to move forward.

Players' choices permanently open or close storylines and affect players' non-player character (NPC) companions. It is intended that the game should provide more context for characters' missions than any previous MMORPG. Every character in the game, including the player character, features full voice dialog to enhance gameplay, and interactions feature a dialogue system similar to that used in the *Mass Effect* series. Players are able to choose from a variety of NPCs, although spending time with a single companion will help more in developing story and content than dividing time among several, and may even develop a love interest. It is possible for players to "blow it big time" if they fail to meet NPCs' expectations. Players also have access to several planets, including Korriban, Ord Mantell, Nal Hutta, Tython, Coruscant, Balmorra, Alderaan, Tatooine, Dromund Kaas, Taris, Belsavis, Voss, Hoth, Corellia, Ilum, and Quesh, and the moon Nar Shaddaa. The planet Makeb was added in Patch 2.0, along with the *Rise of the Hutt Cartel* expansion pack.

Every player receives their own starship, which was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010. Footage of space combat was released at Gamescom. The short clip provided by BioWare revealed that space combat would be a "tunnel shooter". A tunnel shooter, otherwise known as a scrolling shooter or rail shooter, is a flying game where the player is on a predetermined track. Game play includes moving right and left on the X axis and up and down on the Y axis; however, players do not have control of the speed of their space craft. Jake Neri, LucasArts Producer, told PC Gamer in their October 2010 issue that their goal was to "capture the most cinematic moments that we can create. We want players to get in and feel like they're in the movies. It's about highly cinematic, controlled combat moments ... very heroic, action-packed, exciting, visceral and dangerous encounters that'll make you pee your pants." With the December 2013 release of the free expansion, Galactic Starfighter (GSF), players now have a free flight PVP space combat experience, with multiple ships and roles independent of other aspects of the game.

Like many other MMORPGs, the game features dungeons and raids in the form of Flashpoints and Operations respectively.


### Species

A range of playable species are available for the player to choose from, some limited to their factions. Both sides can play Human, Cyborg (human-based), Twi'lek or Zabrak (whose appearances are initially different depending on which side the character is from). The Republic-only races are the Miraluka and Mirialan, while the Empire-only races are the Chiss, Rattataki and Sith Pureblood. Humans and Zabrak can pick any class available, while the other species are restricted to limited choices of classes by default.

More playable species are said to be available in the future through major updates and the Legacy system with the ability to use other classes' abilities through this system. The Cathar were added to the game during Patch 2.1, and is available to all players who unlock the species through the Cartel Market. The Togruta race was announced in January 2015 as a new playable race and released in the same year with patch 3.3. The Nautolan species was then added with the Onslaught expansion in late 2019.

The release of the expanded "Legacy" system in April 2012 allows for species to be able to play all classes (both Empire and Republic) by unlocking that species with an infusion of in-game money or by levelling a character of that race to level 50. Under this system, for example, a player may choose Chiss, which by default can only choose the non-Sith classes on the Empire side, as a new Sith character. Likewise, a Sith Pureblood, which by default can only choose the Force-powered classes, could choose to be a non-Force class. Along the same vein, both species, which are restricted to the Empire, could even choose the option of fighting for the Republic, including training as a Jedi. By the same method, unlocking the Zabrak species allows users to play both appearances regardless from which side the character is from.


### Classes

Each faction contains different classes, each with a distinct backstory and a branching storyline affected by players' moral choices. Classes are exclusive to one faction or the other. However, the classes of one faction mirror the classes of the other (for example, Jedi Knight and Sith Warrior). Eight classes exist: the *Jedi Knight*, *Jedi Consular*, *Trooper*, and *Smuggler* for the Galactic Republic; and the *Sith Warrior*, *Sith Inquisitor*, *Bounty Hunter*, and *Imperial Agent* for the Sith Empire. Although each class has a distinct storyline, they are integrated with the game's overall arc.

Each class may also choose from two advanced classes, resulting in a total of 8 advanced classes per faction. Advanced classes share the same storyline as their base class. Lightsaber and blaster colors are not faction or class restricted, but some are restricted based on level and/or Lightside or Darkside alignment. For example, some lightsabers can only be bought if Light or Darkside aligned.

As of the Legacy of the Sith expansion, players are now allowed to separate their Class Story from their Advanced Classes, which are now called "Combat Styles". Players can now select any force-based combat style when playing force-based class stories, or any tech-based combat style when playing tech-based class stories. These combat styles are still locked to their respective factions; however, you can swap your combat style through the Dark vs. Light alignment system.


### Ships

Each class has their own starship, which serves as the player's base of operations. Bounty Hunters have the D5-Mantis patrol craft. Sith Warriors and Sith Inquistors have the Fury. Imperial Agents have the X-70B Phantom. Smugglers have the XS Freighter. Troopers have the BT-7 Thunderclap. Jedi Knights and Jedi Consulars have the Defender. Certain pieces of these ships can be upgraded, allowing them to perform better in space combat missions.


### Companions

The game features a passive form of crafting, known as Crew Skills, in which a player's companions carry out gathering and crafting tasks asynchronously to the player's adventures out in the world. Each class gets five companions via their storyline. The player can assign up to five companions to perform up to 3 various skills. Crafting skills allow the player's companions to create items, and the player can reverse engineer many items to possibly learn to make a better version. The item is destroyed in the process, but the player gets some of the materials back. Gathering skills allow the player or their companions to gather resources out in the world. Mission skills allow the player's companions to perform acts on the player's behalf, gaining the player Light or Darkside influence and other rewards, such as medical items or companion gifts.

During E3 2011, a video was shown with gameplay footage of the Bounty Hunter, along with a Jawa companion named Blizz. The developers stated during the chat that only the Bounty Hunter would be able to get Blizz and that other classes would have unique companions as well, including some companions that are force users. It was also shown that companions would have a similar character screen as the players and can have gear just like a player character.

BioWare announced same-sex romance options with companions or other NPCs before release. The options were implemented for some non-companions in *Rise of the Hutt Cartel*, and expanded with *Shadow of Revan*. Options for some new companions were implemented in *Knights of the Fallen Empire*, and expanded for some new and original companions with *Knights of the Eternal Empire* up to marriage.

During patch 1.5, HK-51 was added for all classes on both Empire and Republic factions. He was the first companion added to every classes, and can be obtained through a questline. He is an assassin droid based on the popular HK-47 from the original *Knights of the Old Republic* series.

A female Ewok companion, Treek, was implemented in patch 2.3 and is available to all classes. This companion requires either a purchase from the Cartel Market or a 1 million credit fee along with a Legacy Level of 40.

Lana Beniko, a soft-spoken Sith Lord known as "The Dark Advisor" who is seemingly serene and thoughtful in temperament, is a notable companion who first appears as part of Update 2.7 in April 2014 for *Rise of the Hutt Cartel* alongside the addition of Theron Shan. Her role in the overarching narrative of *The Old Republic* is expanded in subsequent expansion packs, starting with *Shadow of Revan*.


#### Vette

Vette is a Twi'lek starting companion for the Sith Warrior, and is voiced by Catherine Taber. A 2012 fan poll by *IGN* placed Vette as the fourth favourite companion. According to BioWare, Vette along with Lana Beniko were the most recruited companions as of July 2016. Larry Everett from *Massively Overpowered* claimed that Vette is "almost universally liked" by players, singling out her quirky personality, sense of adventure, and the quality of Taber's performance for praise. He also suggested that Vette's popularity may be connected to nostalgia, as Taber's earlier character from *Knights of the Old Republic* Mission Vao was another fan favorite. The dynamic nature of Vette's character arc is cited by Robin Burks of *Tech Times* as a demonstration that romance subplots are not mere distractions from the overarching story, but are integrated into the main narrative and help shape who and what the player character becomes by the end of the game. Rolando Gutierrez from *Gamers Decide* assessed Vette to be overall the best companion and romance option for the Sith Warrior based on multiple criteria, including her personality, gameplay utility, and the quality of her romance subplot. *GameZone's* Andrew Clouther used Vette as an example of how dark side oriented character arcs not only "tempts you with evil, but tests your ability to DO evil", and praised the game for its ability to affect players and challenge their consciences. *Kotaku's* Phil Owen drew attention to one scene where the player may have sex with a woman and forbid Vette to leave. While this act is "messed up", allowing players to act evil is a big reason why he holds the game in high regard. *The Mary Sue* contributor Becky Chambers felt that in theory Vette's character concept was fine, and that within a gender equitable *Star Wars* universe created by BioWare her gender could be "entirely incidental". However, Chambers was unconvinced that very few players could play without involving their "personal context" and considered it a problem in the context of the wider gaming community. She expressed discomfort about all available options in dealing with Vette, and criticized BioWare for inadvertently encouraging misogynistic behaviour.

Writing for *Kotaku*, Mike Fahey, after playing the game, recalled players boasting of their torturing of Vette and her low affection rating for them. The *Daily Mail* cited Fahey's article as a source and published a story the following day alleging that the option to treat Vette decently was not popular or encouraged; the paper was criticized for its lack of evidence for its statements and its selective information. *MCV* writer Ben Parfitt and James Stephanie Sterling from *Destructoid* both criticized the *Daily Mail* for the lack of evidence behind its sensationalist assertions. Andy Robinson of *Computer and Video Games* echoed the criticism of their lack of evidence, as well as noting their omission that female player characters are equally able to shock Vette and a hypocrisy displayed by the paper's other sexually-oriented articles. *Religion Dispatches* published a case study in response to the controversy, which analyses their findings from a survey of 369 players which asked how they chose to interact with Vette through roleplaying their player characters.


## Development

*The Old Republic* is BioWare's first entry into the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) market, and is the third *Star Wars* MMORPG after *Star Wars Galaxies*, which was shut down in December 2011, the same month SWTOR was released and *Clone Wars Adventures*, which was shut down in March 2014. The development saw the entirety of BioWare Austin working on the game. BioWare had long been interested in working on a MMORPG, but waited until they had "the right partners, the right team, and the right I.P." A major focus in the game is on developing characters' individual stories and, in October 2008, BioWare considered this game to have more story content than all of their other games combined. The writing team worked on the project longer than any of the game's other development teams. An October 2008 preview noted some of the 12 full-time writers had been working on *The Old Republic* for more than two years at that point. Although BioWare has not disclosed development costs, industry leaders and financial analysts have estimated it to be between $150 million and $200 million or more, making it, at the time, the most expensive video game made, though if marketing costs are included, it is eclipsed by *Grand Theft Auto V*, with an estimated cost of $265 million. The game had 1 million subscribers within three days of its launch, making it the world's "fastest-growing MMO ever". However, in the following months the game lost a fair share of its subscriptions, but has remained profitable. The game has since adopted the hybrid free-to-play business model with remaining subscription option. It is estimated that the game made $139 million in additional revenues, in addition to the subscription income, in 2013.

The game's first cinematic trailer, "Deceived", was shown at the Electronic Arts 2009 E3 Press Conference on June 1, 2009. A public live demo was shown for the first time at the Gamescom. On September 29, 2009, BioWare announced that they would be accepting applications for testers from the game community. Within minutes, the official website was down due to traffic, and BioWare announced shortly after that the site was being changed in order to accommodate the increase in visitors. A second cinematic trailer, "Hope", was released on June 14, 2010, that depicts another battle that happened before the game, the Battle of Alderaan. On June 6, a new trailer "Return" was released at E3 2011 depicting the initial Sith invasion force as it retakes its home world of Korriban. Game testing was officially announced to be underway on July 9, 2010, for testers from North American territories.

The Australasia release was delayed, to hold back digital and boxed copies to avoid any problems encountered during launch. However, BioWare revealed that the game would not be region or IP blocked, allowing players to purchase the game from other regions. Additionally, BioWare allowed Australian and New Zealand players to take part in the beta stages of the game. BioWare community manager Allison Berryman said "Data from this test will be used to inform decisions about the launch of the game in Oceanic regions".

On October 11, 2011, BioWare announced that *Star Wars: The Old Republic* would be released globally on December 20, 2011. However, this 'global' launch only included North America and a part of Europe, as the launch date had delayed for the Asia and Oceanic regions. On December 21, 2011, BioWare announced that an Australian and New Zealand release date had been set for March 1, 2012.

Early access to the game was granted one week before release, on December 13, 2011, for those who had pre-ordered the game online; access opened in "waves" based on pre-order date.

On January 18, 2012, the first content patch (1.1) was released, adding a new Flashpoint and adding four bosses to an existing Operation. Patch (1.2) was released on April 12, 2012. The update included the new Legacy system, a new Flashpoint, Operation, a PVP Warzone, as well as improved character textures and advanced options such as user interface customization. Guild banks and player character pets were introduced. A Weekend Pass Free Trial was made available for new players but has since closed. Patch 1.3 was released in June 2012. The game update featured a New Group Finder, the ability to augment every item, adaptable social gear, and the ability to request character transfer between servers. Subsequent patches have introduced a 'Cartel Market' where players can purchase virtual currency to spend on cosmetic items in-game. These items include armour sets, lightsaber colour crystals, mounts, pets and character-perk unlocks.

In January 2012, *Star Wars: The Old Republic* was officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the "Largest Entertainment Voice Over Project Ever", with over 200,000 lines of recorded dialogue. This feat is recorded in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition book. On April 26, 2012, BioWare announced that the game was available in the Middle East and remaining European countries who were excluded from the original launch. On July 21, 2020, the game became available on Steam.

In June 2023, IGN reported that EA would be making a deal to move the ongoing development and operation of *The Old Republic* from BioWare to Broadsword Online Games, which maintains *Ultima Online* and *Dark Age of Camelot*, to allow BioWare to focus on the *Mass Effect* and *Dragon Age* franchises.


### Subscription

*The Old Republic* required a monthly subscription to play, following a month of play included with the initial purchase. Options are available to pay for one month, two month, three month, or six month blocks, with discounted rates for multiple month blocks. Payment is by credit card or time card. The free-to-play version integrates most of the primary features in the game, but has several restrictions, such as credit limits and reduced leveling speed.

After launch, the game's subscribers rose to 1.7 million by February 2012. By May 2012, those numbers fell to 1.3 million. By July 2012, the subscriber base fell below 1 million, prompting EA to convert the game to free-to-play. EA stated that 500,000 subscribers were needed to make the game profitable saying that they were "well above" that number. By May 2013, subscriptions had fallen below 500,000 but at the time, stabilized there. On November 15, 2012, the free-to-play option went live on all servers. As of August 2014 the game has over one million monthly players.

#### *Rise of the Hutt Cartel*

In October 2012, BioWare announced *The Old Republic*'s first digital expansion pack, *Rise of the Hutt Cartel*, in which the Hutt Cartel's attempts to challenge the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire for control of the galaxy. The level cap was raised to 55. The battle with the Hutts and leveling above 50 is centered on the planet Makeb, which hides a "powerful secret". Much like the main game, the campaign on Makeb is fully voiced.

*Rise of the Hutt Cartel* was released on April 14, 2013. Those who pre-ordered the expansion prior to January 7, 2013, were allowed early access on April 9. In late September, *Rise of the Hutt Cartel* became free after subscribing to the game.

*Rise of the Hutt Cartel* is now free to play for all players in *Star Wars: The Old Republic*.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Starfighter*

In October 2013, BioWare announced its next expansion, which unlike its predecessor *Rise of the Hutt Cartel* did not include any story content; however, *Galactic Starfighter* introduced 12v12 space-based PvP combat on two maps, with 2 'capture-the-flag' combat missions. Three stock starfighters were made available—a scout, a strike fighter, and a gunship. More are accessible for Cartel Coins. Subscribers began their early access on December 3, 2013, with full subscriber awards if they maintained an active subscription on November 1. "Preferred access" players, those who do not have an active subscription but have purchased items via the Cartel Market, received their early access on January 14, 2014, with some rewards. Full access to all players with an account opened on February 4, 2014. A new "deathmatch" game style was added with the update, as well as a new starfighter class, the bomber.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Galactic Strongholds*

In January 2014, BioWare revealed plans for 2014 including two expansion packs, with one similar to *Galactic Starfighter* in scope and one more closely resembling *Rise of the Hutt Cartel*. The first is entitled *Galactic Strongholds*, introducing player housing and flagships for guilds. Subscribers received early access August 19, 2014, as well as access to the exclusive "Nar Shaddaa Sky Palace"; preferred access players received early access starting in September. Full access to all players with an account opened in October 2014.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Shadow of Revan*

On October 6, BioWare announced the second planned story expansion, entitled *Shadow of Revan*. The expansion is centered on the Order of Revan, formerly a fringe group that appeared early in Imperial missions, now a great army seeking to establish a new galactic order, led by the reborn Revan himself. The campaign raised the level cap to 60, and takes place on two new worlds: Rishi, a tropical pirate haven on the edge of the galaxy, and Yavin 4 (which first appeared in the original *Star Wars* film), home of an ancient Sith warrior sect called the Massassi. *Shadow of Revan* was available for preorder. Players who preordered before November 2, 2014, received an experience boost that granted twelve times multiplicative experience for class-related missions, seven days of early access, a grand statue of Revan for placement in strongholds, and a free edition of *Rise of the Hutt Cartel* (to give to another player). The expansion was released on December 9, 2014.

The expansion is now free to play for all players.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Fallen Empire*

In June 2015, the third story expansion for the game, titled *Knights of the Fallen Empire*, was announced at EA's E3 2015 press conference. *Knights of the Fallen Empire* features a renewed focus on cinematic storytelling, as well as new planets, new companions, a dynamic story affected by player choices and a level cap of 65. A cinematic trailer, titled "Sacrifice", was released along with the initial announcement. The trailer, made by Blur Studio, received critical acclaim, and was awarded the "Best Trailer of E3" Award by IGN. The first nine chapters of *Knights of the Fallen Empire* were launched on October 27, 2015, with additional chapters starting in early 2016. Subscribers received one level 60 character token. After the release of *Knights of the Fallen Empire*, *Rise of the Hutt Cartel* and *Shadow of Revan* became free for those subscribing to the game, and access remains on the account if a subscription is canceled.

The release of *Knights of the Fallen Empire* depicts the story of "The Outlander"—the player character. The expansion introduced new companion characters available to all classes. One feature introduced with the expansion was the Alliance system. It entails recruiting allies, including some companions from other classes that formerly were restricted, from across the galaxy to join the fight against the Eternal Empire. Players were given the ability to strengthen their rebellion by providing resources to "Specialists" that oversee four areas of operation: Technology, Underworld Trade, Military and Force-Usage. Most of the early game content was heavily streamlined, allowing players to level up a character by completing solely story and class-specific missions if they so choose. A solo mode was also introduced for story-critical flashpoints. The new storyline, featuring primarily solo content, has 13 chapters.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Knights of the Eternal Throne*

In December 2016, *Knights of the Eternal Throne* was released as the fourth story expansion and sixth major update that coincided with the game's five-year anniversary. A cinematic trailer, titled "Betrayed", was released along with the initial announcement of the expansion. The expansion continued the story of the Outlander. Subscribers received one level 65 character token, with additional tokens available at the cartel store. The storyline has nine chapters of solo content and it raised the level cap to 70. The expansion focused on defeating Empress Vaylin and the Eternal Empire. During the expansion, developers released several key updates and patches that continued the story and added new activities.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Onslaught*

In April 2019, it was announced on the official site that the next expansion, *Onslaught*, would be released in September 2019. The expansion was to follow the new story that was begun with *Jedi Under Siege*. In August, it was announced that the release date for *Onslaught* had been moved back from September 2019 to October 22, 2019. *Onslaught*'s release timeline (nearly three years) was the largest gap between expansions and major game updates which typically occurred annually. This expansion raised the level cap to 75.


#### *Star Wars: The Old Republic: Legacy of the Sith*

In celebration of the game's ten-year anniversary, *Legacy of the Sith* was revealed as the eighth major expansion on July 2, 2021 in an official Twitch livestream. The expansion represents a continuation of the storyline from *Onslaught*, where the player pursues Darth Malgus across the galaxy to uncover his plans, while participating in a major battle on the ocean world of Manaan which has been invaded by the Sith Empire. The expansion raises the level cap to 80 and introduced revamped character creation, with expanded advanced classes where Force-user and Tech-user classes can utilize the other Force and Tech advanced classes and weapons and gain abilities based on light or dark alignment. The expansion was scheduled for release on December 14, 2021, free for subscribers, but its release date was postponed until February 15, 2022. A new cinematic trailer, titled "Disorder", was released on the same day as the expansion.


## Cinematic trailers

Bioware released six short films as cinematic trailers for *The Old Republic* and its expansion packs. *Deceived* was released on June 1, 2009 and shows the Sith attack on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant ten years prior to the game. *Hope* was released on June 14, 2010 and shows the Battle of Alderaan 24 years prior to the game. *Return* was released on June 6, 2011 and shows the attack on a Republic space station over the ancient Sith homeworld Korriban, that started the war, 38 years prior to the game. *Sacrifice* was released on June 14, 2015 and depicts the story of Arcann and Thexan, twin heirs of Valkorion, Emperor of the Eternal Empire. *Betrayed* was released on October 7, 2016 and depicts the story of Vaylin. *Disorder* was released on February 15, 2022 and shows the Jedi Denolm Orr and Sa'har Kateen as they try to retrieve the holocron of Darth Nul, the creator of the Children of the Emperor. The first five were later rereleased in 4K resolution.


## Other media

Chronicle Books released *The Art and Making of Star Wars: The Old Republic* in November 2011, which chronicles the creation of the game and includes concept artwork and interviews from the development team.

Leading up to game's release on December 20, BioWare released music tracks from the game each day which were not included with the soundtrack which came with the Collector's Edition of the game. The first track released was titled "The Mandalorian Blockade".

Razer released several peripherals based on the game to coincide with the launch date. The peripherals included custom made keyboards, mice, gaming headsets and mouse pads.

Between 2012 and 2014, LEGO released four sets based on the game, *9497 Republic Striker-class Starfighter*, *9500 Sith Fury-class Interceptor*, *75001 Republic Troopers vs. Sith Troopers* and *75025 Jedi Defender-class Cruiser* as part of its *Lego Star Wars* theme.

Electronic Arts later brought two Sith characters from the game into its mobile free-to-play turn-based RPG, *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*, the Sith Marauder and eventually Darth Malgus himself.
