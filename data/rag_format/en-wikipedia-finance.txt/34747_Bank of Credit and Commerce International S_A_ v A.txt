Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A. v Aboody


# Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A. v Aboody



***Bank of Credit and Commerce International S.A. v Aboody*** [1992] 4 All ER 955 is an English contract law case relating to undue influence.


## Facts

Mrs. Aboody signed a document making a charge over the family home in favour of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, to secure her husbandâ€™s borrowing for his company. Mr. Aboody had bullied her, and she had signed to get some peace.


## Judgment

Slade LJ held that because of *National Westminster Bank plc v Morgan* [1985] UKHL 2 "manifest disadvantage" had to be shown even in cases of actual undue influence. The transaction was not manifestly disadvantageous.

This requirement was subsequently overruled by the House of Lords in *CIBC Mortgages plc v Pitt* [1993] UKHL 7 (21 October 1993).
