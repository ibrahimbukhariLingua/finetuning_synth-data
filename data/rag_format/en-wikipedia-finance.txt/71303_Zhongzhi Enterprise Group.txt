# Zhongzhi Enterprise Group



**Zhongzhi Enterprise Group** (Chinese: 中融鼎新, hereafter *Zhongzhi*) is a Chinese business conglomerate. It has been described as a shadow bank in the Chinese financial system. The company is heavily linked to the Chinese real estate sector, which since 2020 has been experiencing difficulties. At its peak, the company controlled $141 billion of assets. On 5 January 2024, the company declared itself bankrupt.

The company was founded in 1995 by Xie Zhikun, who died in December 2021. The founder's death, and subsequent departure of senior executives, was blamed by the company for its struggles in November 2023.


## Collapse

In November 2023, the company noted to investors that it was "heavily insolvent with up to $64 billion in liabilities", or a shortfall of $36.4 billion. It was noted after the fact, that problems had been around since August 2023 when a subsidiary had missed payments. Soon after this, the Chinese authorities started investigations against the company.

On 5 January 2024, Zhongzhi declared bankruptcy at the Beijing First Intermediate People’s Court after it could not repay its outstanding debts.
