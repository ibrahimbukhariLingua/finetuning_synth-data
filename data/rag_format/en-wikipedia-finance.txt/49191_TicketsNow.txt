## History

Founded by Mike Domek in 1992, the company was originally known as VIP Tour Company before being rebranded as TicketsNow in 1999.

TicketsNow has a few major competitors. These competitors include StubHub, TicketNetwork, Seatgeek, Vivid Seats.


## 2009 Controversy

In 2009, suspicion arose when consumers attempting to purchase tickets to a Bruce Springsteen concert were instantly redirected from Ticketmaster.com to TicketsNow and saw the same tickets being sold at premium prices. As a ticket broker owned by Ticketmaster, rumors abounded that Ticketmaster conspired to divert buyers away from the main site at normal prices towards the broker site at inflated prices. Springsteen and the E Street Band referred to the controversy as "a pure conflict of interest".
