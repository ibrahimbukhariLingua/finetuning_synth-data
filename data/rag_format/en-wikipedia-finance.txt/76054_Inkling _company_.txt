## History

Matt MacInnis, Josh Forman, and Robert Cromwell founded Inkling in August 2009. MacInnis became the CEO, with Forman as the VP, Product and Cromwell as the VP, Engineering. In August 2010, the company launched its iPad app and announced partnerships with John Wiley & Sons, McGraw-Hill, and Wolters Kluwer.

The company initially focused on creating interactive e-book versions of existing textbooks. In 2011, it added other types of general-interest non-fiction titles, such as travel guides and cookbooks.

In early 2014, Inkling pivoted from a business-to-consumer model to a business-to-business model. After that, the majority of their revenue came from licensing fees under the Software as a Service model. Inkling stopped producing e-books, but has continued to sell its existing e-books through its online bookstore, publishers’ online stores, and the Apple App Store.

In August 2014, Inkling was named #105 on the *Inc.* 500 list of the fastest-growing companies.

On December 13, 2016, Inkling announced a $25 million round of funding. Sapphire Ventures led the round, with participation from Sequoia Capital and Tenaya Capital.

On November 26, 2018, Inkling appointed Jeff Carr as their new CEO.

On January 10, 2022, Inkling appointed Mike Parks as their new CEO.
