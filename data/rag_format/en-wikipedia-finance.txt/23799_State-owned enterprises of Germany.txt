State-owned enterprises of Germany


# State-owned enterprises of Germany



In the wake of the 2007 financial crisis Germany's stock of gross financial assets increased
significantly, turning it into the second largest stock among OECD countries after the US. Yet research has shown that the more that the government owns of an enterprise, the more extreme the level of tax avoidance.

### Further government ownerships

* a range of competing Landesbanken, regionally organised by the LÃ¤nder, function predominantly to provide wholesale banking, part of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe
* the Sparkassen, also part of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe with more than 400 German SOEs holding more than 40% of bank assets in Germany
* Germany owns an approximate 4% stake in British Telecom as 12% of the stake of British Telecom was sold to T-Mobile in early 2015.

Note that many smaller State owned enterprises are owned by individual states of Germany such as TransnetBW and Rothaus (State Brewery of Baden).

On a local and regional level, public transport is often operated by SOE, such as BVB (Berlin), Hochbahn (Hamburg) or LVB (Leipzig). Power generation, water and gas supply were until the 1990s often publicly owned (Stadtwerke) - the picture is much more diverse today, involving often forms of PPP, but with the local governments still exercising considerable control.
