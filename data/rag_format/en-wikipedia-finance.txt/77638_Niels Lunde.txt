He later became a reporter on economic issues at the Danish morning daily Berlingske Tidende in 1995.

In 2006 the format of the newspaper was changed from broadsheet to compact format.

In November 2006 Niels Lunde and two of the reporters of the newspaper were charged by the Danish Prosecutor with disclosing information from the Danish Defence Intelligence Service on the Iraq-war. The material disclosed information on the government's position and were confidential for reasons of national security. The case received international coverage and in December 2006 the three men were acquitted. The verdict was seen as an important milestone in the work of strengthening the freedom of the press.
