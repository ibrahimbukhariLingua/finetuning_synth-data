## History

The company was founded in 1966 by Sarah Schlesinger. It was known as Schlesinger Associates from 1984, when her son Steve Schlesinger also joined the company. In 2000, Mike Sullivan joined the company as President and joint owner to oversee the development of new facilities and services across the US and in Europe.

In the years 1997-2008, Schlesinger Group underwent a national expansion, opening offices and facilities in the major American cities. In 2006, it acquired the British market research company The Research House, followed in 2010 by the simultaneous takeover of the French companies ConsuMed Research and Passerelles, and in 2011 of the German company Schmiedl Marktforschung.

In January 2018, Schlesinger announced a rebrand, which included a company name change to Schlesinger Group. In addition to a new trading name, the rebrand featured a new logo design and brand identity, a new website, and a flagship facility in Midtown Manhattan, NYC, opening in February 2018. In other adjustments, Schlesinger Interactive has rebranded to Schlesinger Quantitative to more clearly describe the online survey and in person-fieldwork services delivered. Schlesinger's European brand names (BDI Research, Schmiedl Maktforschung, The Research House, ConsuMed Research & Passerelles) remain unchanged, while they adopt the new brand identity.

In October 2015, Schlesinger Group acquired Chicago-based medical fieldwork company MedQuery. In June 2017, the company acquired Spain based BDI Research a full service fieldwork agency. The amounts were not disclosed in any merger.
