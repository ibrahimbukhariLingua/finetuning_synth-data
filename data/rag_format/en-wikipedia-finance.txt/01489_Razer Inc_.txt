## Products

Razer's products are generally targeted at gamers and include gaming laptops, gaming tablets, and PC peripherals such as mice (e.g. Razer Naga), audio devices, keyboards, mouse mats, and gamepads. Most Razer products are named after predatory or venomous animals, ranging from snakes (mice), insects (mouse mats), arachnids (keyboards), marine creatures (audio), and felines (console peripherals). The exceptions to this are the Razer Blade series of laptops and Razer Edge, which are instead named after bladed objects.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Razer has also released a VOIP software called Razer Comms.

The Razer DeathAdder gaming mouse introduced in 2006 is the company's most popular mouse line by sales, having sold over 20 million units worldwide by June 2024. Razer mice are used by around 8% of professional first-person shooter gamers. In 2021, Razer introduced a new 8 kHz "HyperPolling" technology to power the Razer Viper 8K.

Razer announced its first gaming smartphone, the Razer Phone, in November 2017, which marked the company's first steps into the smartphone business.

In January 2021, Razer launched a range of high-grade designer masks as part of the company's initiative, Project Hazel, in a move to encourage more people to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The mask is designed to allow lip-reading by seeing facial cues when people talk, with LED lights to illuminate the wearer's face in dark environments. Project Hazel was later launched, renamed as the Zephyr in October 2021 as an N95-rated mask. However, it was discovered later in that year that it was not N95-rated, despite Razer claiming that it was; this caused them to update the language used in the page to saying that they are not N95-certified. In April 2024, a proposed settlement was announced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that would require Razer to issue over $1.1 million in refunds to customers who purchased Zephyr masks, which the FTC alleges Razer made misleading statements about and failed to have tested by either the Food and Drug Administration or the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The $1.1 million settlement was issued by the FTC in January 2025.
