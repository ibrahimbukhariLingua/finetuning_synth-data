## Fundamental principles and functions of Good Management

The professional practice models of Adm.A. are articulated around the fundamental principles and functions of good management. Good management is generally perceived as management as a "good father" or as a "reasonable and prudent person", and is enriched by principles that take into account the current tools and contexts of the administration.

The six fundamental principles of the sound management of the "Ordre des administrateurs agréés du Québec" are the basis of the profession of certified administrator:

6.**Self-denial**: An Adm.A. must put the interests of the client before his own interests, those of his business or his employer. An Adm.A. must respect the fields of expertise of other professionals advising the client (financial planner, cpa, notary, lawyer, etc.) and intermediaries assigned to the file. Faced with opportunities related to his business relationship, an Adm.A. should avoid placing themselves in a conflict of interest.


## Competencies linked to the administration

In addition, an Adm.A. professional practice is based on sound management, which is divided into five competencies linked to the administration:

## Title "Financial Planner" (Pl.Fin.)

Since 1991, the OAAQ is regulating the designation "Financial Planner" (F.P.) worn by its members who graduated from the Institut québécois de planification financière (English: Institute of Financial Planning of Quebec) (IQPF) which provides the basic training leading to the title.

Under the aegis of the OAAQ, the P.F. (Pl.Fin.) membership reached about 650 members in 2002-2003. Until December 2002, the OAAQ administered in Quebec the title of "RFP-Registered Financial Planner" to which the Adm.A. Pl.Fin. could qualify; this title was issued by the "Canadian Association of Financial Planners" (CAFP), which merged with CAIFA (Canadian Association of insurance and Financial Advisor) in 2003 to become Advocis.

In 2004, following extensive studies and consultations, the OAAQ repositioned the generally accepted practice model of Adm.A. Pl.Fin. to the patrimonial administration. This expanded practice model covers the roles of administering the property of others and supporting roles related to patrimonial administration.

The "Financial Planning Competency Charter" was designed in 1998 by the OAAQ and was updated in 2001. This charter describes the professional skills required to practice as a "Financial Planner" within the OAAQ. In 2004, the OAAQ launched the first edition of the book "Guide des meilleures pratiques en gestion de patrimoine privé" (translation: "Guide to Best Practices in Private Wealth Management"). In June 2008, publisher CCH, in partnership with the OAAQ, published the second edition of the book entitled "Gestion de patrimoine privé - Guide des meilleures pratiques" (translation: "Private Wealth Management - Best Practice Guide") (741 pages).


## Title "Certified Management Consultant" (CMC)

Since 1994, the Order of ADMA has applied to supervise, develop and promote the profession of Certified Management Consultant (CMC) in Quebec. By February 2014, this designation was recognized in 50 countries. This designation is administered by CMC Canada and internationally by the "International Council of Management Consulting Institutes".

The CMC title is the only recognized management title in the world. This designation aims at high standards of professional management skills, in particular through advanced training and by instructing the professional on the various aspects of the managerial administration.

In Quebec, at first instance, the holders of the CMC title apply the OAAQ code of ethics. In addition, the CMC-Canada uniform Canada-wide code of ethics is respected by all CMAs. in Canada; it contains provisions relating to integrity, objectivity, transparency, competence, conflicts of interest, invoicing, quality of services, etc. CMC-Canada has also developed a Common Knowledge and Competency Charter (CBK) that includes all the knowledge and skills required to practice the profession of management consultant. This charter is explained in the book "Management Consulting: An Introduction to the Methodologies, Tools and Techniques of the Profession", which is offered free to new members C.M.C. CMC-Canada is planning soon to release more elaborate volumes covering six functional areas (financial management, human resources management, information technology management, marketing management, operations management and strategic management).

The "Canadian Charter of Competencies" covers nine areas:
1. Appreciate the company's situation, challenges and opportunities;
2. Assist clients in developing strategies for improvement;

## Administration of the condominium

Many members Adm.A. have developed special expertise to practice their professional practice in this condominium management which constitutes a collective heritage. This domain integrates the patrimonial administration of the collective heritage and the managerial management of the operations of the co-ownership. The OAAQ is particularly involved in the supervision of this field of activities through information, training and instrumentation. The OAAQ is a partner of McGill University for the certificate program in co-ownership: Certificate of professional development in condominium management.

A website on condominium management was launched on June 16, 2015. Under the auspices of the Chambre des notaires du Québec (Chamber of Notaries of Quebec), at the request of the "Quebec Department of Justice", this site is a follow-up to one of the recommendations contained in the "Report of the Advisory Committee on Co-ownership (2013)" on the large-scale dissemination of quality information on condominium law.

This portal on co-ownership brings together the expertise of self-regulatory organizations (notably the "Ordre des administrateurs agréés du Québec") whose members play a significant role in this field. This site provides useful information for developers, unions, buyers and sellers.
