Gobi Cashmere


# Gobi Cashmere



**Gobi Corporation** *(Mongolian: ГОВЬ ХК***)** is a Mongolian luxury cashmere manufacturer co-headquartered in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Gobi Cashmere (English: /ˈgəʊ.bi kæʃ.mɪər/) opened in 1981. Since it started operating, Gobi has become one of the five biggest vertically integrated manufacturers specialising in cashmere, camel wool, and yak down products in the world. Gobi was privatized under the legal name FCI LLC in July 2007.

Gobi has official two branch stores located in Berlin and Düsseldorf and 62 franchise stores globally.


## History

Gobi opened officially after installing cashmere and camel wool processing machinery, completing its adjustments in 1981. The company's name refers to the Gobi Desert. It is also the main area where the majority of raw cashmere is sourced from.

Within UNIDO project implementation, a cashmere and camel wool processing experimental factory was opened. For three months, 78 engineers were trained in Japan to learn how to process cashmere and camel wool and operate factory machinery.

The state-owned Gobi Company was privatized under the legal name FCI LLC in July 2007. For many years, cashmere has been a vital crop for farmers who live on the move. One of Mongolia's main exports is extremely soft wool, which is combed from the undercoat of goats that flourish in its plains, mountains, and forests. Other top exports include minerals like copper and gold.

In 2012, the mineral boom in Mongolia drove up the cost of Gobi's production. It was due to the fact that Mongolia's newly found mineral wealth drove up the inflation by 12% that year. It had severe side effects to other businesses, especially GOBI Cashmere, that increased the price of raw materials.

As of 2019, Gobi corporation has around 3,000 employees. In September 2019, the company announced the opening of a US office in Los Angeles and an e-commerce website catering exclusively to US customers.

Following the COVID-19 crisis and the drop in cashmere sales, GOBI Cashmere laid off 10% of its workforce. The fall in demand from importing companies decreased the price of raw materials from 90,000 MNT per kg to 55,000 MNT per kg. Despite the lower prices, demand for cashmere fell internationally. This was considered bad news for the Mongolian economy as more than one third of the population lives a nomadic life and cashmere production makes up almost 90% of the household income for these nomadic households.
