## Controversies

In January 2023, a social infrastructure provider owned by Antin - The Hesley Group - was the subject of an investigation by BBC News. BBC News reported that children in care were punched, locked out naked, and had vinegar poured on cuts. The complaints were raised 3 years prior to the closure of the children's home. The BBC commissioned research that found more than a quarter of all children's home placements in England and Wales were run by private equity firms, and criticised the alleged lack of accountability in the sector. Hesley was put up for sale in 2023.
