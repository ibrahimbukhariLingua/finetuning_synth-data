## History

Spescom was founded in September 1977 by Tony Farah with ZAR 4,000 capital. The company's initial focus was on test instrumentation, and it brought the world's first digital oscilloscope to South Africa in the same year.

In 1983, Spescom International Incorporated was established in Irvine, California by Gary Smith, a senior founding member of Spescom. The objectives of this international arm of the company were to maintain technical links with the company's suppliers, as well as to provide international marketing for products developed by Spescom. The company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on 4 June 1987. In September 1990 the company developed and introduced the world's first keypad prepayment electricity meter, Cashpower 2000, to South Africa. The device was licensed by meter manufacturers worldwide. In 1993, Spescom won its first major international tender for prepayment meters in Brazil. These meters are now sold in over thirty-five countries worldwide.

On 6 March 1995, the company formed a joint venture with Siemens called Energy Measurements, to provide a world centre of excellence in energy management and revenue collection systems, focusing on prepayment electricity metering. Spescom no longer has an interest in this market space.

In 2007, Spescom narrowed its focus, exiting its interest in the enterprise software sector with the sale of its US operation, Enterprise Informatics, to concentrate on the accelerating global trend towards the convergence of voice, video and data communications.
In 2008, the company introduced Libra Mobile, the first unified system combining mobile and fixed-line telephony recording.

In 2010, the company established NewTelco South Africa in partnership with NewTelco GmbH. NewTelco SA is a carrier neutral co-location service provider for local, regional and international carriers in South Africa. In mid-2010, the company established an office in Kampala, Uganda from which to launch its entry into East Africa. Today, Spescom is a major supplier to large African communication organisations including Telkom, Neotel and Sentech public South African and regional television and radio broadcasters; large financial institutions, public sector clients and some of the largest contact centres on the African continent.
