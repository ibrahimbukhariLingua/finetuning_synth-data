# Volksbank Group



The **Volksbank Group** (German pronunciation: [ˈfɔlksˌbaŋk ɡɹuːp], lit. 'People's Bank Group') is a cooperative banking group in Austria, whose central entity is Vienna-based **Volksbank Wien AG**. It includes seven other regional banks as well as a specialized bank for the health professions in Austria. The group has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.


## Overview

There were 35 local Volksbanks in Austria by end of 2015, each of them organized as a cooperative or a corporation. By 2017 they merged to 8 regional banks and 2 specialized banks. They form an integrated system of banks (Association of Volksbanks) connected through a contract of collaboration. Volksbank Wien is the largest regional bank of the association and acts as central entity for the network.

The central service functions were transferred from ÔVAG [de] to Volksbank Wien AG in July 2015. ÖVAG itself surrendered its banking license. The "remainder of ÖVAG" subsequently continued to operate as a wind-down entity under the name of immigon portfolioabbau ag. Immigon is responsible for ensuring the orderly, active and value-preserving wind-down of its assets.


## Association

The representative association of the Volksbank Group members is the Österreichischer Genossenschaftsverband [de] (ÖGV), established in 1872.
