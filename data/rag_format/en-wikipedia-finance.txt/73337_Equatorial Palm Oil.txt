## Activity in Liberia

It has a concession in Grand Bassa, Rivercess and Sinoe Counties in Liberia of 169,000 hectares, including 1000 hectares of plantation land in 2010.
It holds interests in 34,398 hectares of land at Palm Bay area; 54,550 hectares of land at Butaw area; and 80,000 hectares of land in River Cess County.
Hectares of its plantation area in Liberia were set on fire in the course of a land dispute with locals. Some locals have accused the company of not putting people originating in the area into top jobs. Residents have often accused the district’s representative, Hon. Robertson Siawaye and others politicians of plotting against them and siding with the company to take away their land. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said
that they can rest assure that there would be no further expansion by EPO.
EPO is accused of involvement in the arbitrary arrest and assault of Liberian community members who claim that they were resisting EPO's efforts to take their land.
In September 2013, officers from the EPO security team and the Liberian Police reportedly worked together to assault and beat Jogbahn community members who were peacefully protesting the company's operations.

On 13 January 2021, Equatorial Palm Oil PLC changed its name to Capital Metals PLC. The Company is now engaged in the exploration and development of mineral sands resources in Sri Lanka.
