**Fentener van Vlissingen** is a Dutch patrician dynasty of entrepreneurs.


## History

Gerrit Oloffsz. van Vlissingen, a blacksmith living in Utrecht in the early 17th century, is the oldest known ancestor. Originating from Utrecht, the family of Lutheran descent became known for being merchants of wine, wool and honey. The family was also known for its involvement in the brick-making and brewing industries. The family soon built interests in factories and began trading. In 1896, the family founded the SHV, which dealt in coal, oil, gas, and scrap metal. It has since diversified its interests into shipping and retail.

In 1968 the seventh generation of the family founded wholesale self-service store chain Makro. The Fentener van Vlissingen family is one of the richest families in the Netherlands. Dutch magazine *Quote* has estimated the family's total wealth to be about €11.2 billion.
