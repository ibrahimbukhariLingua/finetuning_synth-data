## History

The Wałbrzych Special Economic Zone "INVEST - PARK is situated in south-west Poland in Dolnoslaskie, Opolskie, Wielkopolskie and Lubuskie Voivodeship.

The region where the Zone has been established, for hundred years was connected with the textile and mining industries. The region had also rich industrial traditions in such fields like machinery, electricity, ceramic, mechanical engineering, plastic processing and electrical engineering. Liquidation of the coal mines that started at beginning of the 1990s had a negative influence on the state of cooperating plants, including the mechanical, electrical engineering and others supplying needs of mining. It resulted in a rapid increase in unemployment.
Immediately, the precaution actions have been taken to change this situation and restructure the existing plants. One of those solutions, aiming to improve economic growth of the region was establishing of the Wałbrzych Special Economic Zone. At the beginning, it occupied space of 255 hectares (630 acres), located within four subzones: Wałbrzych, Dzierżoniów, Nowa Ruda and Kłodzko.

The administration of the zone has been entrusted the Wałbrzych Special Economic Zone "INVEST - PARK" limited company with its head office in Wałbrzych. Its main shareholders are: the Treasury of State which has a decisive number of votes, communes where there are subzones, financing institutions - banks and Authority Agencies, including Agency of Industry Development S.A. The task of the Company is, first of all, to run a promotion of investment within the zone and to develop the zone by means of administration with property, development of infrastructure and full qualified service of the investors. The managing Company has got rights given by Minister of Economy to run bids and negotiations for sale of lands and the right of giving permissions for running a business within the zone.

Due to dynamic development of the Zone and high land usage ratio of areas within the Zone (including fully occupancy of areas in several Subzones) by the end of year 2000 areas of the WSEZ systematically were enlarged and new Subzones were established. Starting from year 2004 new regulations entered into force enabling establishing of a Subzone of the WSEZ for new area, so far not included in the special economic zone. The condition to establish new Subzone was realization of a new investment of value at least 40 million Euro or creation of at least 500 new work places. Among others following companies took advantage of the new regulation: Electrolux, IBM, Wabco, Colgate-Palmolive and Cadbury. Next, redletter year for WSEZ "INVEST-PARK" was 2006, when areas located within the Zone were developed in over 85%. According to the amendments, the zone gained nearly 500 ha of additional grounds at the beginning of 2007.
