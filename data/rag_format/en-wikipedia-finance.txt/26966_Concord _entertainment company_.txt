Concord (entertainment company)


# Concord (entertainment company)



**Concord**, the assumed business name of **Alchemy Copyrights LLC**, is an independent American holding company dealing in creative rights primarily in the music industry. It develops, manages and acquires sound recordings, music publishing rights, theatrical performance rights and narrative content. It has been funded by Barings LLC (until 2016 Wood Creek Capital Management), by Sound Investors and by members of its management team.

Concord holds rights to more than 1.3 million songs, composed works, plays, musicals and active recordings. In 2020, 45% of its revenue came from music, 38% from music publishing and 17% from theatricals. As of 2023, according to its CEO, it derived 85% of its revenue "from catalog, rather than newly-developed, music".

Headquartered in Nashville with additional offices in Los Angeles, New York City, London, Berlin, Melbourne and Miami and staff in Auckland, Sydney, Toronto and Tokyo, Concord's repertoire is licensed in virtually every country and territory worldwide.


## History


### Concord Jazz (1973–1994)

Auto dealer and jazz enthusiast Carl Jefferson started the Concord Jazz record label in 1973. He sold the label to Alliance Entertainment in 1994, and Glen Barros was appointed as CEO of the resulting company Concord Records.


### Concord Records (1994–2004)

In 1999, film/television producer Norman Lear and entertainment executive Hal Gaba purchased the company (Concord Jazz and Concord Records) after Alliance filed for bankruptcy. By 2000, the company had begun to receive financial backing from J.P. Morgan & Co.


### Concord Music Group (2004–2015)

In 2004, Concord Records acquired Fantasy, Inc., owner of Prestige, Fantasy, Milestone, Riverside, Specialty, and the post-Atlantic Stax catalog. Concord then combined with Fantasy to form the Concord Music Group. Several label acquisitions and partnerships followed including Telarc (2005) and Rounder Records (2010).

In 2005, Universal began to distribute Concord's recorded music worldwide, which accounted for about 5% of Universal's US market share in 2020.

In February 2008, Concord Music Group merged with Village Roadshow Pictures to form Village Roadshow Entertainment Group (VREG).

In 2010, the State of Michigan Retirement Systems invested its first $25 million into Concord Music Group through Wood Creek Capital Management (a wholly owned unit of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company).

In March 2013, Concord Music Group was acquired from Village Roadshow Entertainment Group by an investor group led by Wood Creek Capital Management and Sound Investors LLC for an estimated $120 million. Many of the same investors also owned a majority interest in independent music publisher Bicycle Music Company. Norman Lear retired to become chairman emeritus, replaced by Steve Smith who joined Concord Music Group from the new owner consortium along with Scott Pascucci. Smith, who had co-founded the music industry tip sheet Album Network in the late 1970s and sold it to Network Magazine Group and SJS Entertainment, itself acquired by SFX Entertainment in 1998, had been the president of SFX briefly in 2000 and chief operating officer of SFX's successor Clear Channel Entertainment from 2001 to 2002. He had acquired Bicycle Music in 2004, where he worked with Jake Wisely and partnered up with Steven Salm of Wood Creek in 2006 to boost the company's financing. By the end of April 2013, Smith was chairman of a company called Alchemy Copyrights.


### Concord Bicycle Music (2015–2017)

On October 28, 2014, Alchemy Copyrights LLC was incorporated, with its headquarters registered as Wilmington, Delaware. On December 23, 2014, its Nashville-based subsidiary and namesake was formed.

On April 1, 2015, Concord Music Group, still led by Glen Barros, announced its merger with Bicycle Music, owned by Wood Creek and led by Jake Wisely. The merged companies became subsidiaries of Concord Bicycle Music, a portfolio company of Wood Creek, with Scott Pascucci as CEO. The Concord Music Group division oversaw recorded music activities, and the Bicycle Music Company division managed publishing and rights. As Concord Bicycle Music, the company acquired Razor & Tie, Vanguard Records, Sugar Hill Records, Wind-up Records, Fearless Records, and Musart Music Group including its Edimusa publishing arm (2016).

Following the merger announcement, the Delaware parent and the California branch of Concord Bicycle Assets LLC were incorporated on October 21 and 22, 2015, respectively.

On June 2, 2017, Concord Bicycle Music purchased European-based publishing company Imagem Music Group from a Dutch pension fund. After acquiring two theatrical licensing companies, Tams-Witmark Music Library and Samuel French in 2018, the company formed its own Theatricals division.


### Concord (2017–present)

During 2017, the Concord Music Group, Bicycle Music and Imagem divisions of Concord Bicycle Music were consolidated as Concord Music, and Barros was appointed as chief operating officer.

In 2017, a streaming rights deal signed between Universal and Spotify gave Concord access to Spotify's marketing tools.

By 2018, in the estimation of its chief business development officer Steve Salm, the company's revenue placed it in between "corporate giants" and "most indies", which gave it "an advantage in deals".

The name Concord Music remained in use until early 2019. By May 1, 2019, the company was restyled as Concord. Concord Music had described itself as "a wholly owned subsidiary" or as "the operating entity of Alchemy Copyrights LLC, an investment company that is owned by Barings Alternative Investments, Sound Investors, and seventy institutional and individual partners, including forty members of Concord Music's management team". After rebranding, Concord would define itself as "a private company funded by long-term institutional capital and members of Concord's management team". By July 2020, Alchemy Copyrights was trading as Concord; the State of Michigan Retirement System was its "ultimate parent".

On January 1, 2021, Jake Wisely, the former Bicycle Music CEO and a partner at Concord, was succeeded by Jim Selby as the chief publishing executive of Concord and joined its board of directors.

On April 26, 2021, Concord acquired Downtown's copyrights consisting of 145,000 owned and co-published copyrights for $300 million.

In late 2021, incoming interest prompted Concord majority owner, the Michigan State Retirement System, to consider a sale of its stake in the company. "We got some very strong bids, and we passed on all of them," commented the then Concord CEO Scott Pascucci. Pascucci reported that Concord received several bids that were "extremely aggressive" but none that were "extraordinary plus."

In September 2022, Concord purchased the publishing and recorded music catalogues of Tony Banks, Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford, as well as the publishing and recorded music catalogue from their years in the band Genesis.

In December 2022, Concord successfully closed $1.8 billion of senior notes, secured by a significant portion of its diversified catalogue of sound recordings and songs. Led by Apollo Global Management and assisted by J.P. Morgan, it was the largest asset-backed securitization offering of music rights in the industry to date in terms of both size of issuance and number of assets (over one million copyrights). Proceeds from the issuance were to be reinvested to support Concord's continued growth in 2023 and beyond.

On July 1, 2023, Bob Valentine (previously the chief financial officer) replaced Scott Pascucci as CEO, and Pascucci was appointed to the board of directors.

On August 11, 2023, Concord, together with its distributor Universal Music Group and Sony Music, the two music industry giants, sued the Internet Archive over its Great 78 Project for $621 million in damages from alleged copyright infringement. The charge was filed before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on the date of its final ruling in the Hachette v. Internet Archive case.

In September 2023, it was announced Concord had acquired the music publishing catalog of the New York, Nashville, and London-based music publisher, Mojo Music & Media. The catalog includes works of bands such as REO Speedwagon, Kiss, and Cheap Trick.

Additionally in September 2023, Concord made an offer to acquire the entirety of Round Hill Music Royalty Fund (RHM) – the UK-listed fund operated by Round Hill Music. In October 2023, the RHM shareholders approved the acquisition, with over 99% of shareholders supporting the deal. With this transaction, Concord exceeded the $2 billion mark in its spending "across recorded music, music publishing and theatricals" since the 2015 merger.
