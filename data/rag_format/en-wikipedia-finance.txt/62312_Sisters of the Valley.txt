## Description

Following practices of biodynamic agriculture, workers regulate their operations by the cycles of the moon, starting two-week production intervals upon the new moon, during which time they also practice chastity and vegetarianism.

The owner and "lead Sister" Christine Meeusen, who does not identify with Christianity, considers the production to be a spiritual activity, whose rituals and incorporate New Age practices and environmentalism, borrowing from "Native American" practices. Meeusen also mentions the Beguines to refer to her business' philosophy.

The members wear religious habits and refer to each other as sisters, but claim no affiliation with a religious order.

*Business Insider* calls the Sisters of the Valley nuns "the most talked-about women in the pot business".
