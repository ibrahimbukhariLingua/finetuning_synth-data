## History

In 1985, James Donald Armstrong and Frederick M. Pakis formed the US-based JDA Software, Inc. in Cleveland, Ohio. After signing a contract with a Phoenix-based automotive retailer in 1987, all eight JDA employees relocated to headquarters in Arizona. After 10 years of operation as a privately held firm, JDA went public on March 15, 1996.

In 2006, JDA acquired Manugistics Group Inc., a Rockville, MD developer and provider of supply chain management software, for over $200 million.

On November 5, 2009, JDA announced its intent to acquire i2 Technologies, a Dallas-based provider of supply chain management software. The acquisition was completed in January 2010. In June 2010, Dillard's Department Stores won a $246 million judgment against i2, claiming damages from use of two supply chain management systems. JDA announced efforts to reduce or reverse this judgment, noting Dillard's still used the software and had done so since 2000. The case was settled in 2011.

On November 1, 2012 it was reported that RedPraire would purchase JDA for $1.9 billion. The merged companies moved forward under the JDA Software name.

On August 8, 2016, JDA was reported to be exploring its sale to Honeywell International Inc. The sale was challenged on August 16, 2016 by The Blackstone Group, giving an alternative to JDA by offering a financing plan.

On January 30, 2017, Girish Rishi succeeded Bal Dail as CEO.

On July 2, 2018, JDA announced an agreement to acquire Blue Yonder GmbH. The acquisition was completed on August 7, 2018.

On February 11, 2020, JDA announced that it was renaming itself to Blue Yonder, Inc. On July 23, Blue Yonder announced the acquisition of Yantriks.

On April 21, 2021, Panasonic announced that it had agreed to acquire Blue Yonder. The acquisition was closed on September 17, 2021. The company operates under the umbrella of the Panasonic Connect group.

In February 2022, CEO Girish Rishi stepped down. In July 2022, Duncan Angove was announced as the new CEO.

In March 2024, it was announced Blue Yonder had acquired the Dallas-headquartered digital supply chain network company, One Network Enterprises for $839 million.

In November 2024, Blue Yonder announced that it had experienced a ransomware attack.
The Termite group took credit of the cyberattack. The cybercriminals claimed to have stolen 680 GB of data from the company, which serves major clients like Starbucks and DHL. The investigation is ongoing, with potential impacts on customer operations.
