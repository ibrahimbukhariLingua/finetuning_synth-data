K-Dow Petrochemicals


# K-Dow Petrochemicals



**K-Dow Petrochemicals** was a planned $17.4 billion joint venture between The Dow Chemical Company and Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC) of the State of Kuwait, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC). A joint venture between the two companies was signed in July 2008. However, critics to the deal from members of the Kuwaiti parliament lead to its collapse in December 2008. Dow sued PIC, and was awarded over $2 bn damages by a non-governmental court in 2012.
