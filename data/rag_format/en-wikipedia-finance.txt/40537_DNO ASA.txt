# DNO ASA



**DNO ASA** (OSE: DNO) is a Norwegian oil and gas operator focused on the Middle East and the North Sea. Founded in 1971 and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, the Company holds stakes in onshore and offshore licenses at various stages of exploration, development and production in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Norway, the United Kingdom and Yemen.


## About DNO

DNO is Norway's oldest oil company and the first to list on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 1981. During the last two decades, the company's focus has shifted from the North Sea to the Middle East region.

In 2004, DNO was the first international oil company to enter the Kurdistan region of Iraq, at a time when the Kurdish region's oil industry was virtually non-existent. The company began production from its flagship Tawke oil field in Kurdistan in 2007 – just two years after the start of exploration activities. The neighboring Peshkabir field was brought on production in 2018.

DNO is now the leading international operator in Kurdistan in terms of production (more than 110,000 barrels of oil per day in 2017) and reserves (the Tawke and Peshkabir fields together hold more than 500 million barrels of proven and probable reserves).

The company also re-entered the North Sea in 2017, acquiring offshore exploration licenses in Norway and the United Kingdom. This has since expanded to include the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea.

In April 2024, DNO ASA, with partners including OKEA ASA, announced the advancement of the Brasse field development in the North Sea, with plans for a tie-back to the nearby Brage platform and a projected start of production in the first half of 2027. The field, expected to be renamed Bestla, holds an estimated 24 million barrels of recoverable reserves and could contribute 10,000 boepd net to OKEA at peak production, with operation potentially extending beyond 2031.

## Criticism from the National Contact Point

The Norwegian National Contact Point concluded in 2018 that DNO had not met the expectations expressed in the OECD Guidelines on prior notice and consultation with the employees of DNO Yemen in connection with suspension of the company's Yemeni operations in 2015. The key issue in the complaint concerned lack of prior notice and consultation between DNO and the employee representatives in Yemen in connection with collective dismissals and suspension of production in the war-like situation that prevailed in 2015. The complaint also concerned the question of whether DNO had obstructed the workers’ right to organize and collective bargaining in Yemen, and the validity of dismissals as part of the downsizing process.

Industri Energi had for some time tried to help the workers of DNO Yemen after having received desperate appeals from the workers who were sacked by text messages and e-mails when the company withdrew from the country, and not been given the wages and benefits they were entitled to. Still the workers have not received the compensation they legally are entitled to according to court decisions in Yemen.
