De La Salle University School of Economics


# De La Salle University School of Economics



The College of Business and Economics of DLSU-Manila, Philippines has formally separated into two entities: the **De La Salle University School of Economics** and the College of Business. Accomplished in 2010, this created a distinct and concentrated academic entity in the university. The main objective of the School of Economics is for the better understanding of the issues surrounding the economic policies found and implemented not only in politics or government, but also in businesses or firms that affect humanity and work.

The Department of Economics is one of only two CHED Centers of Development of the former College of Business and Economics. It aims to produce students that are well-versed with economic principles, policies, and research methodologies, as well as allowing Economics majors to specialize in any one of the following: labor economics, public finance, environmental economics, financial economics, and agricultural economics among others.
