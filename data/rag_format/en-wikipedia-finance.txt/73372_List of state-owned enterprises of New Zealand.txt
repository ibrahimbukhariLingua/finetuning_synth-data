List of state-owned enterprises of New Zealand


# List of state-owned enterprises of New Zealand



State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in New Zealand are registered companies listed under Schedules 1 and 2 of the *State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986*. Most SOEs are former government departments or agencies that were corporatised. They are responsible to the Minister for State Owned Enterprises.

Many other government-owned companies and statutory trading organisations are referred to informally as "state-owned enterprises" although they are not SOEs in the strictest sense. These are also listed here.


## Function

The function of SOEs is to operate successfully as a business, as profitable as those not owned by the Crown. The section of the Act defining this is usually interpreted as meaning that SOEs are expected to ready themselves for privatisation, though this is not always the case.

Two Ministers of the Crown act as the shareholding ministers in the company. In the case of SOEs these are usually the Minister for State Owned Enterprises (see article for list) and the Minister responsible for the particular company.

The Crown is assisted in the running of SOEs and other Crown-owned companies by the Treasury's Commercial Operations group (formerly the Crown Ownership Monitoring Unit).
