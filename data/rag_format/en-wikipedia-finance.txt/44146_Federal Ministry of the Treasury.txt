The **Federal Ministry of the Treasury** (German: *Bundesschatzministerium*) was a ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany charged with overseeing the economic possessions of the Federal government.

It was founded in 1957 as the **Federal Ministry of Federal Patrimony** (German: *Bundesministerium für wirtschaftlichen Besitz des Bundes*) to replace the earlier Ministry for Economic Cooperation.

In 1961, under the auspices of minister Hans Lenz, it was renamed *Federal Ministry for the Treasury*.
