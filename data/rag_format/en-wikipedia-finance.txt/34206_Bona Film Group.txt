## History

Founded in 1999, Polybona was the first domestic private firm to receive a film distribution license from the SARFT. In November 2003, it merged with the China Poly Group, a wealthy business conglomerate wing of the Chinese military, the People's Liberation Army, to form PolyBona Film Distribution.

The company has distributed over 120 domestic and foreign films, including *Confession of Pain*, *Protégé*, *The Myth*, *Initial D*, and *Dragon Tiger Gate*, generating over RMB 1 billion (approximately US$130 million) in box office revenue, capturing over 20% of the overall market share for five years running.

It has also co-produced over 20 feature films, including *The Warlords*, *Red Cliff*, *Flash Point,* and *After This Our Exile*.
