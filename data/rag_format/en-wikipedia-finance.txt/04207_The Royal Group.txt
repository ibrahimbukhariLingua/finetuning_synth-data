## Controversies

The Royal Group is one of several stakeholders in hydroelectric projects in Cambodia that have faced significant criticism for environmental concerns. These issues include illegal logging in protected areas, displacement of indigenous communities, destruction of rural villages, and damage to fishing grounds, all of which occurred without proper environmental assessment reports. Villagers had expressed concerns about speaking up due to the prominence of the project, with some fearing retaliation.
