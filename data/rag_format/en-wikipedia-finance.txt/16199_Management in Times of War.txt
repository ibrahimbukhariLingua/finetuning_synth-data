*"A good and interesting book. Its strength lies in the perspective it offers, which is summarized in the title. It resonates with much of what I teach at The Open University Business School and my experience managing large teams, even though I am not in a war-torn country. This book will appeal to both practitioners and management students. Leadership has a vast contextual aspect that requires deep discussion during wartime — this book enriches that knowledge and is a valuable contribution from the author."* — Antonio Garcia, lecturer at The Open University, a former officer in the South African National Defence Force, and co-author of Number 788.

*“In a crisis, the nonessential falls away, and what remains is what truly matters. ‘Management in Times of War’ brilliantly captures how Ukrainian leaders harnessed this Essentialist mindset to rise above adversity. They didn’t choose the circumstances, but they did choose their response with their typical grit and intention. As the war continues, these leaders must continue to evolve. This book beautifully illustrates where leaders can go from here.”* — Greg McKeown, author of two NYT bestsellers, *Essentialism* and *Effortless.*
