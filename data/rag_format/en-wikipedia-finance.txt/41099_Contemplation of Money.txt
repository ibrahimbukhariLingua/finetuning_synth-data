Contemplation of Money


# Contemplation of Money



***Contemplation of Money*** (Russian: Созерца́ние де́нег, romanized: *Sozertsániye déneg*) is an conceptual project by the artist Alexey Parygin, realized in the second half of the 1990s, the main semantic element of which were banknotes. The basis is a group of art objects created using the coins and bills of the Bank of Russia, which were in circulation at the time.


## History

The specific mass of money was steadily increasing and depreciating. Square, circle, and triangle, the simple geometric shapes chosen as the matrix for mounting the collages, were programmatically predictable and non-alternative, like ideal meditative figures. The objects were conceived as self-sufficient parts of modular structures with the possibility of variable combination on display, depending on the specific exposition task.

The association with the icon of the Russian avant-garde—Kazimir Malevich’s triptych (*Black Square*, *Black Cross*, *Black Circle*) became a conscious component of the project. It is the same with the form of Byzantine art and old Russian icons.
In this case, the plastic solution of the series of artworks is not perceived as a literal quotation or borrowing.

*Contemplation of Money* is an ironic homage to the *Black Square*, which became one of the turning points in the 20th century art history and almost immediately turned into a speculative idea and manifesto on itself. A clear signpost to indicate the conceptual vector of the project more accurately.

In modern society, Money has long taken the place of God, the sheer speculative idea of its presence giving love and support and faith in eternal life. By means of art, the *Contemplation of Money* and *Art is a Business* projects portrayed money as a New Divine Essence.

In 2006, psychologist Kathleen Vohs conducted a series of experiments on the effects of money on human consciousness. It has been proven that the contemplation of money helps to increase confidence in one’s rightness and gives optimism.

*Contemplation of Money* is the artist’s first philosophical manifesto, which was developed in subsequent artworks: *Art is a Business* (2000-2015), *Art in the Forest* (2000-2005), *Posturbanism Art Project* (since 2005), *City as an Artist's Subjectivity* (2019-2020).
