# Investors Bank Performing Arts Center



The **Investors Bank Performing Arts Center** is a 2,400-seat theater located in Washington Township, in Gloucester County, New Jersey, United States, that is one of South Jersey's major entertainment venues.

Completed in 1998, the 2,400-seat Center was originally designed as the auditorium for Washington Township High School, built to hold the school's 2,000 student body. During the planning stages of the facility, officials decided that the auditorium should host large scale productions in an effort to bring local and regional entertainment to the area.

Now known as the Investors Bank Arts Center, the center originally opened its doors on September 1, 1998, with a production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's *The King & I*.


## History

Before being known as the Investors Bank Arts Center, it was the TD Bank Arts Center, the Commerce Bank Arts Centre, and originally the Washington Township High School's Center for the Performing Arts (CPA) when it opened in 1998. In 1999, Chesapeake Concerts Inc. had to terminate their contract in September via a 60-day escape clause due to the death of its CEO, who died in August. In 2000, the Board of Education hired Township resident Rebecca Marie Keith as the center's manager/grant writer." Keith was dividing her time between writing grants to bring revenues to the center, and also scheduling the performances. In 2004, with a five-year, $300,000 investment, Commerce Bank was looking to capitalize on the school district's performing arts venue. Commerce Bank chairman and president presented Superintendent Thomas Flemming with a $55,000 check after announcing the new name of the CPA, which thereafter became the Commerce Bank Arts Centre. By taking the new name and the $300,000 investment scheduled over the next five years, it would be providing three arts-related scholarships each year, a summer theater program, upgrade in the lighting and sound, and co-sponsor additional events at the center.

In 2015, the name was changed to the Investors Bank Performing Arts Center. It is currently named the Republic Bank Performing Arts Center.

## Additional facts

* In 2002, using $150,000 in state grants and loans, the Washington Township High School Center for the Performing Arts (CPA) purchased and installed an “orchestra shell”. By installing this “shell” it projects the sound out and to the audience.
* The school district used a $75,000 state grant which was obtained by State Senator John J. Matheussen, R-4 of Washington Township, as a year end 2001 “Christmas Tree appropriation” and $75,000 left over from the bonds sold to fund the construction of the CPA.
