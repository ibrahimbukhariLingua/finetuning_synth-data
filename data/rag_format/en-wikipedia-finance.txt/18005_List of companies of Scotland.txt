List of companies of Scotland


# List of companies of Scotland



Scotland is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain.

Traditionally, the Scottish economy has been dominated by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of North Sea oil have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with many large banking and finance firms based there, including the Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group (owners of HBOS); the Government owned Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Life.

Other notable companies based in Edinburgh include Rockstar North, whilst Glasgow, the countries largest city, is home to the International Financial Services District which houses offices of the Scottish Government, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase, and Buchanan Wharf, headquarters of Barclays in Europe. Glasgow also serves as the headquarters of other notable companies, including drinks manufacturer A.G. Barr. Other notable Scottish brands, such as Johnnie Walker, was established in Kilmarnock, and The Designer Rooms was established in Ayr. Popular clothing brands Lyle & Scott and Pringle of Scotland also originate from the country, whilst bus transportation company, Stagecoach Group, is based in Perth.
