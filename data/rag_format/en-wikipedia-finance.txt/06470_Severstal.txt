## History


### 1930s–1993: formation and transformation

During the early 1930s, deposits of iron ore were discovered on the Kola Peninsula and, at about the same time large quantities of coal were discovered in the area of Pechora. These two factors made it possible to establish a viable steel industry in the northwest of Russia.

In 1940, the Government of the Soviet Union published a resolution "*On The Organisation of Steel Making in the North-West of the USSR*", which created a steel mill in Cherepovets, a city accessible by both the Leningrad-Ekaterinburg railway and by the Volga–Baltic Waterway.

In 1947, the construction of Cherepovets Steel Mill was completed.

Facility construction accelerated after the end of World War II, and at 3:25 PM on 24 August 1955, the Cherepovets steel mill was put into operation. Development continued in the following decades, making Cherepovets a major centre of steel production in the Soviet Union.
