Dinar


# Dinar



The **dinar** (/dɪˈnɑːr/) is the name of the principal currency unit in several countries near the Mediterranean Sea, with a more widespread historical use. The English word "dinar" is the transliteration of the Arabic دينار (*dīnār*), which was borrowed via the Syriac *dīnarā* from the Latin dēnārius.

The modern gold dinar is a projected bullion gold coin, and as of 2019ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ is not issued as an official currency by any state.


## History

The modern dinar's historical antecedents are the gold dinar and the silver dirham, the main coin of the medieval Islamic empires, first issued in AH 77 (696–697 AD) (Late Antiquity) by Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The word "dinar" derives from the Latin word "dēnārius," a silver coin of ancient Rome, which was first minted about c. 211 BC.

The Kushan Empire introduced a gold coin known as the *dīnāra* in India in the 1st century AD; the Gupta Empire and its successors up to the 6th century adopted the coin.

The 8th century English king Offa of Mercia minted copies of Abbasid dinars struck in 774 by Caliph Al-Mansur with "Offa Rex" centred on the reverse. The moneyer likely had no understanding of Arabic as the Arabic text contains many errors. Such coins may have been produced for trade with Islamic Spain. These coins are called a Mancus, which is also derived from the Arabic language.
