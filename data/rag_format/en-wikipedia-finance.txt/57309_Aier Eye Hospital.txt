Aier said the incident took place in a hospital located in Guigang. The patient was an 82-year-old woman and "during the surgery, due to local anaesthesia, the patient had intolerance". As she could only speak a local dialect and did not appear to respond to the doctor's warnings in Mandarin, the surgeon "treated the patient roughly in an emergency situation". The patient sustained bruises on her forehead. Aier apologised and paid CNY 500 (US$70) as compensation according to the patient's son. He also said his mother is now blind in her left eye although its not known if it was due to the incident. Aier stated the hospital failed failed to report the incident to headquarters as the incident took place in December 2019 but only became known after Ai posted footage of it. As a result, it dismissed the CEO of the hospital as well as suspended the surgeon involved.
