Pakistan Recovery Fund


# Pakistan Recovery Fund



The **Pakistan Recovery Fund** was a disaster relief fund established by King Charles III, to aid Pakistan after the 2010 monsoon season.

The recovery process was scheduled to run for two years, a period which was deemed sufficiently long to curb the hardship resulting from the disaster.


## History

The 2010 Pakistan floods was combined to create a moving body of water. Creating one of the worst floods in Pakistan's history. The devastation caused by the floods impacted upon the lives of over 20 million people.

King Charles III, concerned with the situation of the people in Pakistan, initiated a recovery fund, which aimed to raise significant investment in funding and support in-kind and goods over the next two years. The fund was one of a number of charitable initiatives under the auspices of the Prince's Charities group: The Prince's Charities

Beyond the ongoing life and health threatening effects, the floods have had a significant negative impact on Pakistan's development prospects over the coming years. Essential infrastructure including roads, bridges, housing, schools, medical facilities, farm structures and markets were severely damaged; causing an estimated damage of up to $43 billion.
