## Site history

The site where *Commerce Place* was built has a lot of history. It is the site where the Bank of Hamilton was established in 1872. in 1905 the Bank was doing so well it expanded its head office, adding on an additional 8 stories. This is significant because the bank headquarters became Hamilton's first skyscraper. Between 1898 and 1910, the Bank of Hamilton opened 128 branches in Ontario and western Canada; it did not, however, have representation east of Toronto. When the bank merged with The Canadian Bank of Commerce on January 2, 1924, it was one of the last surviving banks not headquartered in Toronto or Montreal.

The architect(s) for Commerce Place were *Pellow & Associates* and the property is managed by *MVD Properties, Inc*.
