Community Action Tenants Union


# Community Action Tenants Union



**Community Action Tenants Union** is a national tenants' union in Ireland. Established in 2019, it is a mass membership organisation of "renters, council tenants, mortgage holders and people in emergency & precarious living situations".

CATU is affiliated to ACORN International.


## Structure

CATU members are organised in local branches across the island of Ireland, with committees elected by local members. A national committee coordinates the work of local branches. CATU organises campaigns at local and national level, and its work is grounded in principles of direct action. Modelled after other ACORN International affiliated tenants' unions such as Scottish Living Rent, CATU was influenced by the work of the National Association of Tenants Organisations (NATO), which represented tenants in Ireland in the sixties and the seventies, famously leading a national rent strike from 1970 to 1973.
