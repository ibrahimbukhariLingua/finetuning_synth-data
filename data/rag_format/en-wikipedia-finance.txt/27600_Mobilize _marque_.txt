# Mobilize (marque)



**Mobilize** is a business unit of the French car manufacturer Renault established in 2021 and it is mainly specialized in mobility-related services. It focuses on subscription services, leasing, loans, data, and energy management, offering Mobilize-badged vehicles for car sharing and delivery services.

Mobilize is one of the four brands of the Renault Group, along with Renault, Dacia and Alpine.

Mobilize is available in France and Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, and Morocco.

Based on the premise that purchasing vehicles is no longer the preferred option of drivers, Mobilize aims to focus its offer on rental and car-sharing.


## History

The Mobilize business unit was created in January 2021 as part of a wider overhauling of Renault operations. The new unit was set to develop car sharing and other niche businesses. Mobilize was also aimed at meeting new mobility needs like car-sharing, last-mile delivery and on-demand transport. Created as part of Luca de Meo’s Renaulution plan, Mobilize specializes in mobility services: energy services, driving-related data analysis (like the identification of accident-prone areas, road analysis, traffic and pollution data etc…), financing and car manufacturing.

In January 2021, the unit launched the Mobilize vehicle marque by presenting Mobilize EZ-1 Prototype, a car-sharing prototype quadricycle. Later that year, Renault integrated its **Zity** electric car-sharing business into Mobilize, renaming it **Zity by Mobilize**. The first marketed car was the subscription-only Mobilize Limo (a rebadged JMEV Yi from JMEV), introduced in the second half of 2022. In May 2022, Renault's financial affiliate RCI Banque was made part of the unit, adopting the trade name Mobilize Financial Services.

In October 2022, Mobilize announced Mobilize Fast Charge, its EV fast-charging network, with plans for 200 chargers, primarily at Renault dealerships near major roadways, by mid-2024.

In July 2023, Mobilize Financial Services subsidiary, Mobilize Lease&co announced its acquisition of two German companies belonging to the MeinAuto Group, Mobility Concept and MeinAuto.

In August 2023, Mobilize acquired shares in Select Car Leasing, a UK-based leasing company.
