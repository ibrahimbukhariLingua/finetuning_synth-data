The **Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited** (UETCL) is a parastatal company whose primary purpose is to make bulk electricity purchases and transmit the electricity along high-voltage wires to local and foreign distribution points. UETCL is the sole authorized national bulk energy purchaser and the sole authorized electricity importer and exporter in Uganda.


## Location

The headquarters of UETCL are at 10 Hannington Road on Nakasero Hill in Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. The coordinates of the company headquarters are 0°19'13.0"N 32°35'12.5"E (Latitude:0.320278; Longitude:32.586806).


## History

The company was incorporated as a limited company on 26th March 2001 by an act of the Ugandan parliament following the break-up of the defunct Uganda Electricity Board.


## Operations

UETCL is responsible for the development, operations, maintenance, and improvement of the high-voltage power transmission lines, above 33kV, in Uganda. It also owns and operates the high-voltage substations (above 33kV), around the country. UETCL is wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and is regulated by the Ugandan Ministry of Energy & Mineral Development.

To reduce electricity transmission losses in the country, UETCL has borrowed US$100 million (UGX:337 billion) from Exim Bank of China to construct four mega substations. The installations will feed the industrial parks at Luzira, Namanve, Mukono, and Iganga. The work also involves construction of 38 kilometres (24 mi) of 132 kilovolt transmission lines.
