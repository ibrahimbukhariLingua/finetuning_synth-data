## Controversies

In March 2006 Vijay Eswaran, and his business partners Joseph Bismark, Tagumpay Kintanar and Donna Marie Imson were accused of allegedly defrauding two Filipinos of more than $100,000 in the Gold Quest pyramid scheme. They were charged before the Quezon City Regional Trial Court of syndicated estafa, which was a non-bailable offence on the basis of a criminal complaint. In April 2006 Judge Bayani Vargas ordered the issuance of arrest warrants against the four accused. The Department of Justice, Office of the City Prosecutor later dropped the charges following a Jakarta courts dismissal of the extradition request from the National Bureau of Investigation and citing it to be a civil liability and not a criminal case.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In May 2007 a dispute in Manila, Philippines filed by two former partners of the original founding team escalated to an alleged 'offence' leading to an Interpol Red alert listing the four directors. Interpol put out a warrant for their arrest and the case was fought out substantially in the courts of Manila and Jakarta. The Goldquest executives had asked the Philippines Supreme Court to stop the Quezeon City Regional Court trial pending resolution of a petition for review. After three weeks, Indonesian courts released Vijay Eswaran; a Manila court dismissed the charge soon afterward.

As per the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the FIRs are being stayed on the grounds mentioned in the Writ Petition. The petition claims that the business model followed by Vihaan Direct Selling (India) Pvt. Ltd is not a money circulation scheme as alleged, and does not fall under the purview of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation (Banning) Act 1978. The petition further states that the business of Vihaan is compliant with all legal requirements of conducting business in India.

A 2003 charge against Gold Quest for its fraudulent activities in Chennai, India, reached the Supreme Court, which in 2014 allowed the quashing of the proceedings. The Supreme Court appointed a one-man commission, a retired Judge of the Madras High Court, to settle all legitimate claims of around 200 depositors.

In 2009 money circulation charges were brought against Gold Quest by Tamil Nadu police. The Chennai Enforcement Directorate, attached Gold Quest properties worth 150 crore to the case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act. There was a Red Corner notice issued for Eswaran's arrest. In an interviewᵇʸ ʷʰᵒᵐ? about the charges, Vijay Eswaran denied any wrongdoing. Qnet has also stated that Vijay Eswaran is neither director nor shareholder of Qnet's franchise in India (Vihaan Direct Selling Pvt. Ltd.).

In August 2013, Times of India reported that Vijay Eswaran was being investigated by the Economic Offences wing in regards to Qnet, which he founded. The Economic Offences Wing issued lookout notice against Eswaran and a few others, after he failed to appear before the authorities for questioning. Police froze six of Qnet's bank accounts in the country. QNet denied the allegations fully, stating that its operations are legal, compliant and transparent.

In 2014 the Enforcement Directorate in 2014 accused Vijay Eswaran of money laundering, along with his company, Qnet. This allegation has been denied by both the company QNet and Vijay Eswaran.

In 2016, after 3 years of investigation, the Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai Police issued lookout notices against 30 people in connection with the Qnet controversy. As founder of Qnet, Vijay Eswaran was featured as the key defendant of the case.

In February 2018 Qnet was prosecuted for fraud and forgery at trial court of Labe, Somalia, but the proceedings were later halted, and charges dropped.
