**Bykea**, stylized as **BYKEA**, is a Pakistani ride-hailing service and parcel delivery company based in Karachi. It was founded by Muneeb Maayr in 2016.


## History

Bykea was started in December 2016 in Karachi, Pakistan. The company currently operates in four Pakistani cities: Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, & Rawalpindi.

In 2018, Bykea partnered with Jazz, a Pakistan-based digital communications company, to provide enhanced digital connectivity and efficiency to users. In 2018, Bykea and MJSF (Mahvash and Jahangir Siddiqui Foundation) joined for the Bikers Support Scheme.

In 2019, Bykea raised $5.7 million in series A funding from local and international institutions.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, Bykea had secured a $13 million investment. However, due to the government's ban on pillion riding to combat the virus, investors reneged on the deal.


## Services

Bykea enables a crowdsourced network of motorbike owners to transport people, parcels, on-demand shopping, and payments within a city.

In early 2022, Bykea added rickshaws. In mid-2022, they started offering AC and non-AC in their ride-hailing service.
