## History

In 1919, W.T. Kemper and Associates bought shares in City Center Bank, and R. Crosby Kemper became the president of the company. In 1926, the bank built a six-story headquarters, adding a drive-up service window in 1928. In 1934, the bank was renamed City National Bank and Trust Company and moved to Kansas City's financial center. In 1959, R. Crosby Kemper Jr. (a third generation banker from the Kemper family) became president of the bank and led the installation of its first computer processing system. City National acquired several other banks over the years as banking laws changed. In 1969, it reorganized as a holding company, Missouri Bancshares, which changed its name to United Missouri Bancshares (UMB) in 1971.

In 1987, UMB acquired FCB Corp. and its three banks in Southern Illinois. In 1992, UMB expanded into Colorado with the purchase of Valley Bank and National Bank of the West in Colorado Springs. UMB acquired Denver's Columbine National Bank in 1992, and in 1994, all of UMB's Colorado banks were merged into one entity, UMB Bank Colorado. To reflect its expansion outside of Missouri, UMB changed its name to the current UMB Financial Corporation in 1994. In 1995, UMB acquired Oklahoma Bank and its holding company, First Sooner Bancshares. That same year, UMB entered the online banking market in conjunction with Visa Interactive.

In 2001, UMB purchased Sunstone Financial Group Inc. and rebranded it to UMB Fund Services, Inc. It followed in 2002 with its purchase of State Street Bank & Trust Company of Missouri. In 2001 UMB also established Scout Investment Advisors Inc.
