## History

IDI was established in 1989 in Atlanta by Henry "Greg" Gregory and a few partners, including former president and chief executive officer Timothy Gunter. The company started with $35 million in investments from Japan-based parent company, Kajima, and a bridge loan from First Union National Bank, now Wells Fargo. IDI was one of the first companies to approach industrial development from a national standpoint to meet customers' needs.

In 2013, IDI was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). In 2014, IDI and Gazeley, a European industrial real estate company, were co-branded by Brookfield as IDI Gazeley Brookfield Logistics Properties.

In 2017, Gazeley was sold and IDI is now known as IDI Logistics.

In 2018, IDI Logistics was sold to Ivanho√© Cambridge and Oxford Properties in a 50-50 joint venture partnership agreement.
