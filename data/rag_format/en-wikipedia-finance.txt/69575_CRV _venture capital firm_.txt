# CRV (venture capital firm)



**CRV** is a venture capital firm focused on early-stage investments in technology. The firm was founded in 1970 to commercialize research that came out of MIT. Its name comes from the Boston area Charles River.


## History

The firm has raised over $4.3 billion since inception across 18 funds. Upon closing of the 16th fund, the firm rebranded to CRV. Prior to that, CRV's 15th fund closed in February 2012 with $375 million of investor commitments. CRV's 14th fund raised $320 million of commitments.

In 2013, it purchased a large portion of Pebble Technology for $15 million and is credited as the primary reason why Pebble was sold to Fitbit in December 2016. This netted CRV nearly $40 million.

In 2024, CRV returned 275 million dollars from the 500 million it had raised in its current fund back to investors, stating that their focus would shift away from late-stage investments and toward the early stage.

Among CRV's portfolio companies are Aveksa, mabl, OneLogin, Stella, Sybase, Yammer, and Zendesk.
