## Early life and studies

Elena Panaritis was born in Athens, Greece. She studied Economics at the American College of Greece, graduating with a BA in 1989, and went on to the University of Bologna Italy, to get her Master's in International Economics, in 1990. In 1992, she received a Master's in International Economics and European Studies from Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies and in 2003 a Master's in Business Administration from INSEAD.

During her studies, Panaritis focused on economic theory, international finance, and institutional economics, fields that would later form the backbone of her work on property rights and economic reform. Her education at Johns Hopkins exposed her to global perspectives on economic policy, sparking her interest in using economic tools to address the structural causes of poverty and development.

Panaritis started working in the World Bank, Washington, DC, in 1991, as a regional analyst. As the bank's Deputy Country Officer for Peru, she supervised the state's privatization and debt restructuring programs. She also assisted in the drafting of conditions agreed with Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela, for structural adjustment lending, fiscal adjustments and privatization.

As a Public/Private Sector Management Specialist at the World Bank, Panaritis worked, among other programs, on the property rights reforms in the Philippines, and on judicial reforms in Trinidad and Tobago, and designed the conditions for a $100 million loan to Morocco.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
