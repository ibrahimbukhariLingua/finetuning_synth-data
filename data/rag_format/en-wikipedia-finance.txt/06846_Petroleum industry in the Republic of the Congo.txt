## Oil and gas


### Oil

In the late 1970s, Congo emerged as a significant oil producer, with production expanding considerably during the 1990s. By the turn of the century, production began to decline as existing oil fields reached maturity. As of 2008, oil production has increased every year as a result of several new projects, mainly Congo's first deep-water field Moho-Bilondo. The Congo is the sixth largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.

As of 2021, the Congo has 1,811 million barrels of proven crude oil reserves. Their crude oil production is measured at 267 thousand barrels per day. The accompanying downstream oil industry is an important element in the country's economy. It is predominantly run by foreign companies and centered on the coastal city of Pointe-Noire where the Congolaise de Raffinage (Coraf) operates the 21,000 bpd Pointe Noire refinery.
