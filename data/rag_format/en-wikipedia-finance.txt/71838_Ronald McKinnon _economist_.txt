# Ronald McKinnon (economist)



**Ronald Ian McKinnon** (10 July 1935 – 1 October 2014) was an applied economist. His primary interests were international economics and economic development, with strong secondary interests in transitional economies and fiscal federalism. Understanding financial institutions in general, and monetary institutions in particular, was central to his teaching and research, with interests ranging from the proper regulation of banks and financial markets in poorer countries to the historical evolution of global and regional monetary systems in the context of the world dollar standard.

He had been a professor of economics at the Stanford University since 1961. In particular, he researched international trade and finance, economic development, monetary theory and policy; money and banking.

McKinnon is best known for developing the theory of "Financial repression" in 1973, working alongside his colleague Edward Shaw.
