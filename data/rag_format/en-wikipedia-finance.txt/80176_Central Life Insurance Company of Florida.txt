## Closure and legacy

Central Life Insurance Company of Florida was shut down by Florida state regulators on August 27, 1991. The company had failed to modernize, which led to issues financially and with insurance regulators. One of the insurance company's potential investors had failed to provide backing, and around the same time another of their potential investors was accused of defrauding other insurance companies in Florida and had his assets seized by the state.

One of Central Life Insurance Company of Florida's founders, George Schroeder Middleton, had a Black high school named after him in 1934, George Schroeder Middleton Senior High School (now George S. Middleton High School).
