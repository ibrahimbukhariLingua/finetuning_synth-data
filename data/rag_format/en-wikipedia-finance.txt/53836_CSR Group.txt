## History

In 1986 the China National Railway Locomotive & Rolling Stock Industry Corporation [zh] (LORIC) was formed, comprising 35 production sites and 4 research centres. In 2002 LORIC was separated from the Ministry of Railways and **China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation** (CSRG, Chinese: 中国南方机车车辆工业集团公司) was formed. Its main competitor, the China North Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation was formed in the same year.

In 2002 the group manufactured the 270 km/h (170 mph) China Star high speed EMU at the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Works.

Since 2003, the group no longer tax-free on property tax and land rent.

Between 2004 and 2007 CSR had ~50% of the internal Chinese market for locomotives and ~80% of the market for multiple units (by volume), as well as a ~50% share in locomotive and wagon refurbishment. In the same period overseas sales accounted for ~7-8% of revenue.

In 2008 most of the assets were floated as China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corp., Ltd. (later known as CSR Corporation Limited), except some auxiliary assets, as well as the shares of South Huiton.

In April 2010 the Chinese name of CSR Group was renamed (Chinese: 中国南车集团公司).
