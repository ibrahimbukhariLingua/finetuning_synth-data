U Select


# U Select



**U Select** was a chain of supermarkets in Hong Kong operated by China Resources Vanguard, originally in partnership with Tesco. At least one third of the products sold in the store came from overseas supermarket chains. As part of Tesco's decision to cease international product sales due to Brexit, U Select instead started stocking Coles products from December 2021, and also begun stocking Morrisons products from May 2022. The company closed all stores in November 2024 due to declining sales.


## History

On 18 August 2013, China Resources Enterprise's supermarket chain Vanguard and British supermarket Tesco signed a "memorandum of understanding", intending to set up a joint venture interest group in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, operating hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, liquor stores and cash and carry businesses. China Resources and Tesco are holding an 80% and a 20% share respectively.

In April 2015, China Resources opened the first U Select supermarkets, with the first two stores opening on 18 April 2015 in Prince Edward Road West and Bellagio Mall.

In June 2015, the third branch opened on Main Street East, Shau Kei Wan.

On 17 September 2015, the tenth branch (the second outlet in Kowloon) opened at Hip Wo Street in Cheung Wo Court, Kwun Tong.

As of May 2018, there were 37 stores.

As of February 2021, there are 67 stores.

As of July 2021, there are 75 stores.

U Select began winding down operations at all stores in early October 2024. All stores would cease operating by the beginning of November.


## Store types


### U Select

The original branches of U Select had a blue colour scheme and were originally intended to be a value chain, previously only taking cash and not credit/debit cards.
