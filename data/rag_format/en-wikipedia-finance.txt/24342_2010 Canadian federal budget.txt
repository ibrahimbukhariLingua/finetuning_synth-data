During the budget speech on 4 March 2010, Flaherty announced the use of a polymer substrate for the upcoming Frontier Series of banknotes of the Canadian dollar and that future versions of the loonie ($1 coin) and toonie ($2 coin) would be made of steel instead of nickel to reduce manufacturing costs.

The New Democrats and Bloc Quebecois voted against the budget, which passed due to 30 Liberal abstentions.
