**RBG PAC** is an American political action committee (PAC), generally regarded as a Super PAC. It was formed on October 16, 2024, the day after it would be legally required to disclose its donors before the election. Later, it was revealed to be funded solely by the wealthiest individual in the world, Elon Musk.


## History

The PAC was formed on October 16, 2024, the day after it would be legally required to disclose its donors before the election. The PAC aimed to aid Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign by running advertisements which compared Trump and late Supreme Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's political views on the legality of abortion in the United States, attempting to portray them as being similar.

The PAC was financed by one or more secret donors, which were later revealed to be just businessman Elon Musk, the wealthiest individual in the world. The donation came in a single lump sum from the “Elon Musk Revocable Trust” and was timed so that information about it wouldn't have to be released until after the election. In total, the committee spent $20,476,000 on Trump's electoral campaign during the 2024 United States presidential election, which he eventually won.


## Responses

The PAC was criticized by members of Ginsburg's family, who said that it was misleading.


## Efforts

The majority of the PAC's funds were spent on political advertising focused on the 2024 election.
