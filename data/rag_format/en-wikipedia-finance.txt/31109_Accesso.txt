## History

Accesso was established around 2000, and had entered bankruptcy almost immediately. The company then reemerged in 2007.

In 2012, Lo-Q PLC acquired the Lake Mary, Florida-based company, Accesso LLC, for US$22 million. At the time, Lo-Q focused on developing ride-reservation systems for theme parks, while accesso focused on online and mobile ticket sales software and the management of online ticket stores. The merger was seen as a joining of synergistic capabilities and complementary customer sets. Tom Burnet was the CEO of Lo-Q and retained this role after the merger. At the time of the merger, accesso's CEO and owner was former Disney executive Steve Brown; after the merger, Brown joined the board of the new company and became the COO of North American operations.

In November 2013, Lo-Q was renamed as accesso to reflect the company's operations. In December 2013, accesso acquired for US$12 million the Taos, New Mexico-based ticketing and point-of-sale software provider Siriusware. The acquisition provided accesso with a client base that included the ski and snow sports market. On 10 November 2014, accesso acquired VisionOne and their ShoWare ticketing product, a customizable cloud-based ticket sales product, expanding the company's client base into entertainment markets such as theaters, sports stadiums and music festivals. On 30 March 2017, accesso acquired Ingresso, a global distribution system for entertainment ticketing. Later in 2017, the company acquired The Experience Engine (TE2), a guest experience management company, which included customers in venues such as theme parks, ski resorts, hotels, quick service food, healthcare and other hospitality-focused operations.

In 2014, penetration of the South Korean market began via a three-year partnership with an in-country consulting firm.
