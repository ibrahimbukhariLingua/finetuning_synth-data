## History


### Beginnings

Rheaply was founded by Garry Cooper, Peter Tucker and Tyler Skelton in Chicago in 2015. The company started out as a peer-to-peer, virtual marketplace for laboratory equipment and consumables within higher education, where postdoctoral and graduate researchers could share unneeded resources, message each other and connect with nearby departments and laboratories. The name is a portmanteau of “research” and “cheaply.” Today, Rheaply uses circular economy principles and technology to bring better efficiencies to resource recovery and reuse within and across organizations.
