The following is a brief history of the North American rail system, mainly through major changes to Class I railroads, the largest class by operating revenue.

* July 1: The first year of classification by operating revenue begins.
* July 1: The property of the independent Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville Railroad, which entered receivership on February 14, 1908, is conveyed to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway of Indiana, a subsidiary of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.
* December 23: The property of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company is sold to the Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company, remaining a subsidiary of the Oregon Short Line Railroad (Union Pacific Railroad system).

* January 1: The Chicago, Terre Haute and Southeastern Railway begins operations after acquiring the properties of the Southern Indiana Railway and subsidiary Chicago Southern Railway, which entered receivership on August 19 and August 25, 1908, respectively.
* February: The New York Central Railroad sells half of its majority interest in the Rutland Railroad to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.
* April 20: The Blacklick and Yellow Creek Railroad changes its name to Cambria and Indiana Railroad (not yet Class I).
* June 30: The first year of classification by operating revenue ends. There are 177 Class I railroads, including two Canadian companies (Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian Northern Railway) not included in any totals by the ICC, and a separate listing for "Canadian Pacific Lines in Maine" (leased lines of the International Railway of Maine, Aroostook River Railroad, and Houlton Branch Railroad). Grand Trunk Railway of Canada lessor Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad is also listed as a Class I railroad.
* July: The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway gains control of the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway (not yet Class I).
* July 1: Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiaries Cleveland, Akron and Columbus Railway and Cincinnati and Muskingum Valley Railroad, the latter not Class I, merge to form the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway.
* July 1: The Illinois Central Railroad begins operating the property of former subsidiary Indianapolis Southern Railroad, purchased at foreclosure.
* July 21: The Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad buys the property of subsidiary Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad.

* September 16: The International and Great Northern Railway begins operating the former International and Great Northern Railroad, in receivership since February 27, 1908.
* November: The Louisville and Nashville Railroad and St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad jointly buy control of the New Orleans, Mobile and Chicago Railroad, predecessor of the Gulf, Mobile and Northern.

* June 30: The Sunset Railroad is demoted from Class I to II; it will never return to the former classification. The Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway also becomes Class II, since Texas subsidiary Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway of Texas had been listed as a lessor in 1911, but is now listed as an operating subsidiary, and the revenues of the parent alone are not enough to qualify for Class I. On the other hand, the Detroit and Toledo Shore Line Railroad, Oahu Railway and Land Company, and Western Pacific Railroad are newly listed as Class I. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway begins including data for subsidiary Chesapeake and Ohio Railway of Indiana with its own data. With the loss of the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad, Indianapolis Southern Railroad, Iowa Central Railway, and Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway, and electrification of the Spokane and Inland Empire Railroad, the number of Class I railroads drops from 177 in 1911 to 171 as of June 30, 1912.

The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway of Texas starts including its data with parent Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, and, with the disappearance of the Chicago, Milwaukee and Puget Sound Railway and Syracuse, Binghamton and New York Railroad, the number of Class I railroads rises from 171 in 1912 to 176 as of June 30, 1913.
* December 31: The Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad is reorganized under the same name, having been in receivership since July 23, 1910.
