USC Marshall School of Business


# USC Marshall School of Business



The **USC Marshall School of Business** is the business school of the University of Southern California. It is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.

In 1997 the school was renamed following a $35 million donation from alumnus Gordon S. Marshall.


## History

The Marshall School began as the College of Commerce and Business Administration in 1920. The Graduate School of Business Administration was established in 1960. The Entrepreneurship Program, the first of its kind in the United States, was established in 1972 and is internationally recognized. It has now been renamed The Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. The Pacific RIM Education (PRIME) program was implemented in 1997 as the first ever MBA course of its kind to require all first year full-time MBA students to participate in an international experience.

The Leventhal School of Accounting was formed within the school on February 7, 1979. All of its classes are offered at the University Park campus in Los Angeles.

James G. Ellis was the dean from 2007 through June 30, 2019. The interim dean is Gareth James, the E. Morgan Stanley Chair in Business Administration, director of the Institute for Outlier Research in Business, and Professor of Data Sciences and Operations, who has held a number of roles in his more than 20 years at Marshall.

On June 11, 2019, it was announced that Geoffrey Garrett would be leaving the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania at the end of the 2019–2020 academic year to become dean of the Marshall School of Business. Garrett will begin his tenure as dean of Marshall in July 2020.


## Campus

The school occupies five multi-story buildings on campus: Hoffman Hall (HOH), Bridge Hall (BRI), the Accounting building (ACC), Popovich Hall (JKP) and Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall (JFF), which houses the Marshall School's undergraduate programs.


## Popovich hall

This is the main building of the Marshall School's MBA programs. The $20 million, 55,000 square feet (5,100 m²) building opened in 1999 as one of the most technologically advanced business school buildings in the United States. It was named after alumni J. Kristofer Popovich and Jane Hoffman Popovich for their $5 million gift.


### Bridge Hall

Bridge Hall (built in 1928) housed all undergraduate offices for the Marshall School of Business until the opening of Jill & Frank Fertitta Hall in the fall of 2016. Fertitta Hall, a 104,000-square-foot, five-story building, was built expressly for Marshall's undergraduate community. It houses USC Marshall's Undergraduate student services, admissions and advisors' offices. The Office of the Dean, staff offices and a few classrooms continue to be housed at Bridge Hall.


### Hoffman Hall

The H. Leslie Hoffman Hall of Business Administration, which opened in 1973 and stands eight stories tall, is the former home of the Crocker Business Library (now renamed the Gaughan & Tiberti Library on the first floor of Fertitta Hall). It is named for H. Leslie Hoffman, father of Jane Hoffman Popovich. It was designed by architect I.M. Pei. The building was extensively renovated in 2015-16 into faculty offices.


## Programs


### Undergraduate

The Marshall School offers a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. There are several joint programs that offer studies with International Relations and Cinematic Arts in combination with Business Administration. New students take a business core and have other time to fulfill the USC Core and take elective classes with the option to earn one of nine emphases.

The undergraduate program offers a variety of international opportunities. The Global Leadership Program (GLP) comprises a two-semester seminar on business leadership in China and a spring break trip to China.

### Ph.D

Along working with notable faculty, doctoral students also receive substantial financial aid, such as graduate assistantship and a living stipend, during their study.


## Trojan Family
