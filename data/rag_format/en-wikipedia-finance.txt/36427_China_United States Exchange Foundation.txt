China–United States Exchange Foundation


# China–United States Exchange Foundation



The **China–United States Exchange Foundation** (**CUSEF**, simplified Chinese: 中美交流基金会; traditional Chinese: 中美交流基金會) is a Hong Kong-based nonprofit organization whose stated aim is to encourage dialogue and exchanges between the people of the United States and China. CUSEF was founded in 2008 by Tung Chee-hwa, a billionaire, former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, and former vice chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who remains the chairman emeritus of the foundation. CUSEF's governing board has included members such as Ronnie Chan, Elsie Leung, and Victor Fung.

CUSEF donates to universities and think tanks in the U.S. while also sponsoring trips for journalists, students, and former U.S. officials and politicians to China to speak with officials. According to various journalists and academics, CUSEF is a central part of the Chinese Communist Party's united front strategy of influence in the U.S.


## History

According to Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filings, CUSEF is classified as a "foreign principal" which has hired lobbying and public relations firms since 2009 such as Brown Lloyd James, Fontheim International, Covington & Burling, Capitol Counsel LLC, Podesta Group, and Wilson Global Communications to craft and promote pro-Beijing messages.

In 2023, CUSEF launched a campaign to lobby members of the Congressional Black Caucus.


### Sanya Initiative

Since 2008, CUSEF has partnered with the China Association for International Friendly Contact and the EastWest Institute to organize forums, termed the U.S.-China Sanya Initiative, between retired People's Liberation Army (PLA) officers and retired U.S. military personnel. Past forums were reported to have attempted to influence retired U.S. military officers to lobby against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and to delay a Pentagon report on PLA capabilities.


### Trips for elected officials

In 2019, CUSEF sponsored a trip to China by a delegation of mayors from Indiana, Ohio, and South Dakota, including James Brainard and Paul TenHaken.


### University funding

CUSEF funds the Pacific Community Initiative at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. CUSEF also provides funding to the University of Montana's Max S. Baucus Institute.

In 2018, the University of Texas at Austin refused a donation from CUSEF after a letter by Senator Ted Cruz raised concerns about the foundation's reported links to the Chinese Communist Party. In 2023, US House representatives Mike Gallagher, Ryan Zinke, and Matt Rosendale pressed the University of Montana to cut ties with CUSEF related to its funding of student trips to China.


### Foundation grants

In 2021, CUSEF gave a $5 million grant to the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations. CUSEF also provides funding to the Carter Center and has partnered with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Brookings Institution, Atlantic Council, and Center for American Progress.


### Hong Kong Forum on US-China Relations

CUSEF periodically holds the "Hong Kong Forum on US-China Relations" to facilitate exchanges between present and former officials, academics, and business leaders in the US, China, and other nations. In 2023, speakers attending the forum include former US ambassador to China and ex-senator Max Baucus, former US Trade Negotiator Charlene Barshefsky and President of the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly Mogens Lykketoft.


#### Hong Kong Forum 2024

The forum in 2024 included speeches from Xie Feng, China's ambassador to the United States, and Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China delivered through video. The forum was attended by former ambassador Max Baucus, the 12th United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, representatives from families of former US president Carter, Nixon, and Bush.

John Moolenaar, chairman of the United States House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, and Fox News has criticized US officials from attending the forum, stating that it would "legitimize the CCP event."
