# Badcock Home Furniture &more



**W.S. Badcock LLC** (stylized as **Badcock Home Furniture & More**) was an American chain of over 370 company and dealer owned furniture stores in eight states across the southeastern United States. Robert B. Burnette was president of Badcock Home Furniture and previously served as chief operating officer for this company.


## History

The first store was opened by Henry S. Badcock in Mulberry, Florida, in 1904. A year before being listed by *Furniture Today* magazine in the top 25 furniture retailers by sales, it was recognized as a centennial retailer by Florida governor Jeb Bush in 2004. In December 2023, it was announced that Conn's had completed its purchase of the company.

In July 2024, Conn's warned that it may file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection within the coming weeks, blaming inflation, and a decline in sales as part of the decision. The company also blamed its purchase in Badcock as a result of mass losses and struggles. On July 23, 2024, Conn's announced that it would close up to 106 stores across from the Conn's and Badcock brands. 71 Conn's stores and 35 Badcock stores are set to close by the end of summer 2024. That same day, Conn's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Texas, listing assets and liabilities of between $1 billion to $10 billion. The next day, on July 24, 2024, it was reported that Conn's was in the process of winding down and closing all of its nearly 600 Conn's and Badcock locations, with liquidation sales expected to be complete by October 31, 2024.
