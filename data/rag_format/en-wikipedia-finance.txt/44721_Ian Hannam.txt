## Early life

Hannam was born in March 1956. He was born in South London and grew up in Bermondsey, the son of a local government worker. He went to grammar school.

He served in the 21 SAS (Artists Regiment), becoming a Sergeant in 1979 before entering Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1982 and becoming a Captain.

Hannam has a bachelor's degree in engineering from Imperial College London, and worked for the construction company Taylor Woodrow in Nigeria and Oman. He then studied at the London Business School, and moved to the US, and worked for Salomon Brothers and later JP Morgan.

He also completed the first block trade in the London market, selling BP. He also completed the first placing in the London market via book building.


### Robert Fleming

In 1992, Hannam left Salomon Brothers to join Robert Fleming, where he executed the sell down of the Wellcome Trust's holding in Wellcome plc. At the time, it ranked as the world's largest equity deal.

Hannam managed many of the company's deals in Asia, South Africa and the UK. He acted for the Hong Kong Government during the Asian crisis of 1998 in its divestiture of its equity portfolio. He was also the key relationship banker to SABMiller, and was instrumental in obtaining its London listing.

In 2005, Hannam was responsible for leading JPMorgan five-year joint venture with Cazenove, leading to the creation of JPMorgan Cazenove. Until 2015, Hannam was a member of JPMorgan’s Global Equities Management Committee.

In July 2014, Hannam was fined £450,000 for market abuse by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), "one of the largest handed down to an individual and was considered a major coup for the authority". The fine was in connection with "wrongly disclosing confidential information to Iraqi Kurdistan's oil minister, relating to client oil firm Heritage in 2008", when Hannam was working for JP Morgan. In April 2012, Hannam stood down as JP Morgan's global chairman of equity capital markets, in order to deal with the allegations.
