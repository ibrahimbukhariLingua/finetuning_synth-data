## History

Trilantic was spun out from Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking (LBMB), in 2009, by five founding partners, each of whom had workers at LBMB, which had been founded as the private equity arm of Lehman Brothers, in 1986, during the 1980s leveraged buyout boom. In April 2009, Trilantic acquired LBMB out of the bankruptcy estate of Lehman Brothers with the support of Reinet Investments S.C.A, a Luxembourg securitization vehicle controlled by the Rupert family and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. On May 11, 2022, it was announced that Trilantic Europe is buying the polling company Kantar Public (previously part of the Kantar Group) in the third quarter of 2022. Kantar Public subsequently rebranded as Verian.
