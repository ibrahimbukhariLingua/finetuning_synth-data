## History

Founded by Sergey Shishkarev in 1993, the Delo Group began as a freight forwarding company in Novorossiysk. It quickly became the leading private operator of the Port of Novorossiysk, providing over half of all freight forwarding services.

Since 2002, the Delo Group has invested its own funds to build the NUTEP container terminal in the Southeastern cargo district of the Novorossiysk port. In 2004, the terminal was launched and successfully handled its first container ship. In 2019, the Delo Group commissioned a remarkable deep-water berth, No. 38, within the NUTEP terminal. This berth has the capacity to accommodate ocean container ships up to 10,000 TEU. Later the terminal's overall capacity was increased to an impressive 700,000 TEU.

In 2007, Delo Group of Companies made an acquisition of StroyKomplekt integrated plant, which is located adjacent to NUTEP, with the purpose of constructing a state-of-the-art grain terminal known as CJSC Grain Terminal KSK. The first stage of the KSK grain terminal was launched in 2012, boasting a capacity of 2 million tons of grain annually. Subsequently, in 2013, the second stage of the terminal was put into operation, resulting in an increased capacity of 3.5 million tons per year. Notably, in 2021, the grain terminal of KSK JSC welcomed the inauguration of a deep-water grain berth, specifically Berth No. 40A, which enabled the terminal to handle ships with a deadweight of 100,000 tons. As a result, the terminal's throughput capacity now stands at an impressive 6 million tons.

Furthermore, in 2016, Delo Management Company (MC Delo LLC) was established to further strengthen and streamline the company's operations.

In 2018, Delo Group acquired a notable 30.75% stake in Global Ports, which happens to be the largest container terminal operator in Russia. Finally, in 2022, Delo Group further expanded its presence in Global Ports by purchasing an additional 30.75% stake from Maersk, thereby increasing its overall stake in the company to an impressive 61.5%.

In 2019, the Delo Group emerged victorious in an auction for the acquisition of 50% plus two shares of PJSC TransContainer, and in 2020 it consolidated 100% of the company's shares.

In 2022, the Delo Group acquires a 58.67% stake in one of Russia's largest shipping companies, the Sakhalin Shipping Company, which doubles the passage of container trains with imports on the border between Russia and China.

DeloTech, a strategic IT integrator of the Delo Group, was established in 2022. In 2023, the Delo Group consolidated its IT assets based on DeloTech, with the strategic goal of increasing the Group's expertise in the digitalisation of container logistics and realising the potential of assets using information technology.
