## ZimBank lottery

In January 2000, Fallot Chawaua, the Master of Ceremonies of a promotional lottery organised by the Zimbabwe Banking Corporation, announced that Robert Mugabe won the Z$100,000 first prize jackpot. The lottery was open to all clients who had kept Z$5,000 or more in their ZimBank accounts.


## History

ZBBL's origins can be traced to 1951. Ten years later, the financial services organisation from which the bank originated had grown to nine branches countrywide. That organisation was sold to the Netherlands Bank of Rhodesia in 1961. In 1972, the company changed its name to Rhodesia Banking Corporation and then to Rhobank in 1979. Following the purchase of majority shareholding by the government, the company changed its name to the Zimbabwe Banking Corporation in 1981.

In 1989, the company was restructured under one holding company, Zimbabwe Financial Holdings Limited. This allowed the bank to operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of a larger financial conglomerate that also owned other non-banking financial services subsidiaries. The acquisition of other subsidiaries over the years allowed the Group to offer a wide range of services which include commercial and merchant banking, hire purchase and leasing as well as trust and executor services.

On 30 October 2006, the Group adopted a new brand and formally changed its name to ZB Financial Holdings Limited. This change coincided with the merger with former Intermarket Holdings. These new subsidiaries included a bank, two insurance companies and a building society. All subsidiaries adopted the ZB brand across the board.

In June 2014, the financial group merged ZB Bank Limited with ZB Building Society, to meet new capital requirements by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
