## Contents and research


### Integrated business model iOcTen

Doleski developed the integrated business model iOcTen, which is based on the St. Gallen management model. It helps to structure complex connections and integrate all relevant influences and restrictions into a business context. Through five interlocking components iOcTen helps to break down complex connections and processes into small, manageable analysis and work packages. In contrast to other business models, iOcTen takes the normative framework into account and integrates elements such as laws, standards, principles and culture, ensuring that even seemingly unimportant aspects are included and no essential content is forgotten. A five-phase development path helps decision makers to identify potential weaknesses of their planned business model early on and to find solutions.

Furthermore, Doleski's research focuses on the areas of smart markets, transformation of the energy industry and Internet of things.


### Utility 4.0

In 2013, Doleski developed the term Utility 4.0 for innovative energy supply companies. The number 4 stands for a fourth epochal leap in the energy sector: after allocation (Utility 1.0), supply (Utility 2.0) and service (Utility 3.0) comes digitization. The term is not only influenced by the historical division into four phases by the terms Industry 1.0 – 4.0, but also picks up on the discussion about digitalization as the fourth industrial revolution in the production economy under the term Industry 4.0 and transfers it to the energy industry. In 2016, the booklet *Utility 4.0 – Transformation from Utility to Digital Energy Services* was published by Springer Publishing as one of the first publications on the digital transformation of the energy sector. This was followed in 2017 by the book *Herausforderung Utility 4.0 – Wie sich die Energiewirtschaft im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung verändert* and finally in 2020 by the double volume *Realisierung Utility 4.0*.
