In 1991, the company changed its name to Insight Enterprises, and distribution included a full line of computers and accessories. The company held its initial public offering in January 1995.

Insight became an international company when it acquired TC Computers, based in Montreal, Canada, in 1997. In April 1998, Insight signed an agreement to acquire Choice Peripherals Ltd. and Plusnet Technologies Ltd., an Internet service provider and website hosting and development company operating as Force 9.
