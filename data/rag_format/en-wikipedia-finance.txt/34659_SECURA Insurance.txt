## History

SECURA was founded in 1900 after a massive cyclone tore through New Richmond, Wisconsin, destroying homes and businesses, killing more than 100 people, and injuring 500
others. To protect themselves and each other, 135 charter members in the Cicero Township developed The Farmers Home Mutual Hail, Tornado, and Cyclone Insurance Company of Seymour, Wisconsin.

In 1986, this insurance company was renamed SECURA.
