## Weipa railway fleet

In January 1972, Comalco (as the company was then known) ordered two GT26C locomotives to the same design as the Western Australian Government Railways L class (albeit without dynamic brakes), numbered 1.001 and 1.002. A switcher was also imported from Canada, numbered 1.003. In 1994, 1.002 was sold to Westrail and renumbered L276, and would later go on to have dynamic brakes retrofitted, also being renumbered LZ3120. The railway also acquired a prototype JT42C, GML10, from BHP, which was renumbered R1004 (1.001 was also renumbered R1001). In 2009, both R1001 and R1004 were sold to railways on the East Coast of Australia (1001 to El Zorro [renumbered L277] and 1004 to Qube [reverted to its original GML10 designation]), and were replaced by two production-model JT42Cs, R1005 and R1006. 1.003 was scrapped in 2000 after years of disuse.

R1006 was withdrawn and scrapped following a collision in September 2019.
