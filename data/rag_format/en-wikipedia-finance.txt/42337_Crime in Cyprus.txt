Crime in Cyprus


# Crime in Cyprus

 

**Crime in Cyprus** is governed by the legal framework of the Cypriot Penal Code and other relevant legislation. The crime landscape in Cyprus includes various types of offenses, with particular emphasis on financial crime, internet fraud, forgery, drug-related offenses, and human trafficking.

In 2024, according to Global Finance Magazine, Cyprus ranks 13th in their "Safest Countries in the World" list, highlighting its overall low levels of crime, including violent crime, making it one of the safer nations globally.


## Legal proceedings

The legal proceedings in Cyprus are primarily governed by the Cypriot Penal Code and other legislative instruments. When a crime is reported, the police conduct a preliminary investigation to gather evidence and determine the nature of the offense. Prosecutors, who are part of an independent judiciary, decide whether to bring charges based on the evidence collected. Suspects have the right to legal representation and can request further investigations if necessary.


### Confidence in the criminal justice system

In 2023 the Cyprus criminal justice system ranks 23rd globally out of 140 jurisdictions, as evaluated by the World Justice Project.


## Crime statistics

According to recent data, Cyprus experiences relatively low levels of violent crime, with property crimes such as burglary and theft being more common. In 2022, there were notable efforts to combat human trafficking, resulting in several arrests and convictions. The overall crime rate in Cyprus has been stable, with some fluctuations in specific crime categories.


### Financial crimes

Financial crimes, including fraud and money laundering, are significant concerns in Cyprus due to its role as a financial hub. The country has faced scrutiny for its involvement in various financial malpractices.

Cyprus has been a critical node in the financial network for Russian oligarchs and business entities. During the Cypriot financial crisis in 2013, it was revealed that Cypriot banks held a significant amount of Russian money, estimated to be around $31 billion. The involvement of Cyprus in laundering money for Russian entities has been a persistent issue, leading to international scrutiny and calls for reform. One of the most prominent cases involving Cyprus is the Magnitsky Scandal, where a significant portion of a $230 million Russian tax fraud was laundered through Cypriot banks. This case gained international attention after Sergei Magnitsky, a Moscow-based lawyer, exposed the fraud and subsequently died in a Russian prison. The scandal led to the passage of the U.S. Magnitsky Act, which targets human rights offenders with sanctions. In 2023, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides invited officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the United States Department of Justice to assist with investigations into allegations that Cypriot financial service providers had helped Russian oligarchs skirt international sanctions. In 2024, the United States and Cyprus, signed a deal to fight money laundering.

In 2023 Cyprus has been implicated in a major money laundering investigation involving BNP Paribas and a Cypriot brokerage firm, with suspicious financial flows amounting to over €220 million between 2019 and 2021.

The 2022 Council of Europe's Moneyval report highlights that while Cyprus has made progress in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, several challenges remain. The country has improved its compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, but further efforts are needed to fully implement measures, particularly in the non-profit and virtual asset service provider sectors.


#### Cyprus Golden Passport Scandal

The "golden passport" scheme in Cyprus has been widely criticized and exposed for its potential for abuse. The program allowed individuals to obtain Cypriot citizenship in exchange for significant investments, which attracted many high-net-worth individuals, including those with dubious backgrounds.

In 2020 Al Jazeera released an undercover investigation revealing that high-ranking Cypriot officials, including the then House president Demetris Syllouris and former MP Christakis Giovani, were willing to assist a fictitious Chinese investor with a criminal past in acquiring a Cypriot passport. The scandal led to the resignation of the implicated officials and the subsequent cancellation of the citizenship-by-investment program.

An inquiry led by former judge Myron Nicolatos found that the government had illegally granted over half of the 6,779 passports issued between 2007 and 2020, often bypassing due diligence procedures. The scheme, which generated over €8 billion, was criticized for allowing individuals under criminal investigation or international sanctions to obtain Cypriot citizenship.


## Crime trends

In 2023, the crime rate per capita in Cyprus rose for the second consecutive year, with the "crime index" reaching 584 serious offenses per 100,000 residents. However, data from the Cyprus Statistical Service indicates that the overall crime rate in Cyprus has seen an increase, but the nature of the crimes is predominantly non-violent, with property-related offenses leading the statistics.


## Incarceration rate

The incarceration rate in Cyprus is 103 per 100,000 population.


### Council of Europe's recommendations

In 2023 the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) recommended that the Cypriot authorities ensure that foreign nationals are able to progress through their sentences similarly to Cypriot prisoners. This includes the ability to transfer to open prisons and be considered for early release, adhering to the principle of non-discrimination in line with international standards. The CPT advised the Cypriot authorities to enhance support for foreign nationals in the Central Jail of Nicosia by appointing a dedicated foreign national liaison officer, providing written information on prisoner rights, obligations, and house rules upon admission in the most commonly spoken languages and in accessible formats, including systematic information on immigration procedures and ensuring access to interpretation services for foreign national prisoners when needed. This recommendation followed the finding that the Nicosia prison population contained 53.4% foreign inmates, including around 13% who had been arrested for holding false papers.
