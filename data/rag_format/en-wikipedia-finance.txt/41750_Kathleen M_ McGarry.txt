## Research

McGarry's dozens of publications focus on the economics of aging, including public and private transfers, such as those between parents and children as well as the Supplemental Security Income, Social Security, and Medicare programs. She has also studied the market for long-term care. Her most-cited paper, with Amy Finkelstein, on the long-term care insurance market, was the first work cited in the award of the John Bates Clark Medal to Finkelstein. This work showed that there is little relationship between the probability people will need such insurance and the probability that they will purchase this insurance, because people vary in two different ways: how much they believe they will need this insurance, and how cautious they are, and these two different types of variation act in opposite ways.
