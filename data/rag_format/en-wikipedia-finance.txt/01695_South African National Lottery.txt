South African National Lottery


# South African National Lottery



**The National Lottery** is operated by ITHUBA Holdings, to whom the licence was awarded in 2015. The lottery is regulated by the National Lottery Commission and was established in 2000.

Lottery tickets may be bought only by people of at least 18 years of age.

In the 2007 fiscal year transaction values totalled R3.972 billion, with an average of five million transactions per week. In the 2012 National lottery generated R4.7 billion in sales of Lotto and Powerball tickets.

Lotto is the most popular type of gambling in South Africa but Powerball has been the faster-growing for last years due to its high payouts.


## History

The National Lottery was introduced to South Africa on 11 March 2000. At the time it was run by Uthingo.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

After a marketing effort that aimed to reach 80 percent of South African homes directly
more than 800,000 tickets were sold in the first day of availability
Nearly R70 million worth of tickets were sold in the first three weeks of operation.

In October 2002 operator Uthingo suggested a daily lottery to supplement the weekly draw. The concept, called Keno, was rejected by the trade and industry ministry in March 2003.
In November 2003 the Lotto Plus game was launched, acting as a supplementary weekly lottery available on the purchase of a primary lottery ticket, with an entry fee of R1.

In July 2006 the Gidani consortium, featuring Greek company Intralot as a technical partner, was judged the preferred bidder to operate the lottery for seven years starting April 2007. The operating licence was awarded in October 2006.
In March 2007 the Pretoria High Court set aside that award on application by incumbent Uthingo, finding that the failure to adequately investigate the shareholders in some bidding consortia left room for conflicts of interest.

Following the final draw by incumbent Uthingo, the lottery was indefinitely suspended in April 2007.

In September the operating licence was awarded to Gidani again.
When ticket sales re-opened in October more than 200,000 tickets were sold within the first three hours. Gidani introduced scratch cards, but they were discontinued for several months when they lost their licence to Ithuba.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2015, Lotto licences were awarded to ITHUBA. In 2015, two new games were introduced by Ithuba: EAZiWIN, an instant win game consisting of four types of indigenous
-inspired games; Morabaraba, Fafi Fortune, 4 Siya Wina and Popa Feela and PowerBall Plus.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In December 2020 the lottery drew the unusual final number sequence "5", "6", "7", "8" and "9" with a powerball number of "10". This caused controversy with members of the public accusing the lottery of corruption or collusion with the 20 winners.


## Games

Eight games operate under the South African National Lottery brand:


### LOTTO

LOTTO and LOTTO PLUS odds
| Match | Odds of winning | **% of total winning pool** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 and bonus | 1 : 96 | Lotto R20.00, Lotto Plus R15 |
| 3 | 1 : 72 | Lotto R50.00, Lotto Plus R25 |
| 3 and bonus | 1 : 1028 | 7.3% |
| 4 | 1 : 1,371 | 8.4% |
| 4 and bonus | 1 : 30,161 | 5.0% |
| 5 | 1 : 75,402 | 4.0% |
| 5 and bonus | 1 : 3,393,087 | 2.3% |
| All 6 | 1 : 20,358,520 | 73.0% |

Players buy tickets with their choice of six different numbers between 1 and 52; there is a provision for random numbers to be generated automatically for those who do not wish to choose, known as Quick Pick.

When introduced, the LOTTO jackpot draw required numbers from 1 to 49. Ithuba Holdings increased the number from 49 to 52 on 30 July 2017.

In the draw, six numbered balls are drawn without replacement from a set of 52 balls numbered from 1 to 52. A further *Bonus Ball* is also drawn, which affects only players who match five numbers.

Prizes are awarded to players who match at least three of the six drawn numbers, with prizes increasing for matching more of the drawn numbers. All players who match all six drawn numbers win equal shares of the jackpot; the chance of doing so is 1 in 20,358,520. If four, five, or six balls are matched, the relevant prize is divided equally between all who match that many balls. If no player matches all six numbers, the jackpot is added to that of the next Lotto draw—a *Rollover*.

The entry fee to the LOTTO draw is set at R5.00 per board.

The draw is conducted on Wednesdays and Saturdays on SABC 2 at 20:56 Central Africa Time (CAT).


#### LOTTO PLUS 1

LOTTO PLUS 1 is exactly the same as LOTTO, but gives the player a second chance to win. When buying a LOTTO ticket, the player must pay an extra R2.50 per board to enter the LOTTO PLUS 1 draw. Odds are the same, while prizes are usually slightly lower.

LOTTO PLUS was introduced on 26 November 2003.

The draw is conducted on Wednesdays and Saturdays on SABC 2 at 20:56 Central Africa Time (CAT).


#### LOTTO PLUS 2

When introduced, the PowerBall jackpot draw required players to pick five main numbers from 1 to 45 and one 'PowerBall' number from 1 to 20 for an entry fee of R5 per board. Prizes may be won by matching the main numbers, with matches of the PowerBall number winning higher prizes. The top prize of the game is won by matching all five main numbers as well as the PowerBall. Draws take place on Tuesdays and Fridays on Mzansi Magic (DSTV Channel 161) and NewzRoom Afrika (DSTV Channel 405) at 20:58 Central Africa Time (CAT).

After 28 November 2015, odds were changed as more possibilities to win were introduced. Players matching only the Powerball would win money, while before, that ticket would not win anything. In addition, the number of main balls was raised from 45 to 50.

## Socio-economic impact

In June 2003 it was reported that 27 percent of lottery players were unemployed
and that 43 percent of players earned less than R2,000 a month.
It was also reported that legalised gambling had created 50 673 jobs in 2000, although it may have redirected spendings from other industries.

2006 research found that 82 percent of South Africans played the lottery once a week and that 53 percent of the population did not engage in any other form of gambling. The average player spent R81 per month on the lottery.


## Revenue distribution

Under the current operator, Ithuba, 34 percent of revenue is paid to a central charitable distribution fund, up from an initial 28 percent.
Six percent of revenue is paid as retail commission, ten percent is retained as operational costs and 48 percent is paid in prizes.


## Controversies


### Corruption

In 2020, it was reported by GroundUp that people close to senior executives of the National Lottery, including its chairperson Alfred Nevhutanda, had improperly benefited from the charitable distribution fund. The National Lottery responded by initiating criminal charges against the news organisation and a journalist if the stories were not retracted which the National Lottery lost. The stories of corruption and improper benefit resulted in a government investigation of the National Lottery.

In 2024, GroundUp reported that there was a coordinated attack to oust a newly appointed board. MPs from the ANC and EFF in parliament supported those implicated in previous corruption scandals. The board, led by Commissioner Jodi Scholtz and Barney Pityana, sought to root out corruption in the National Lottery and restore integrity and transparency to the NLC.
