SIIF sustainable development and responsible investment market priorities include Iran’s health, transportation, and environmental sectors based on the road map defined between president Schneider-Ammann and president Rouhani in the official visit of Swiss delegates to Tehran in 2017.

SIIF plans include hosting a series of high-level conferences and seminars in Switzerland to provide guidance, comprehensive evaluation, analysis, and discussion of the global economic agenda.
