Allied Domecq


# Allied Domecq



**Allied Domecq PLC** was an multinational company, headquartered in Bristol, United Kingdom, that operated spirits, wine, and quick service restaurant businesses.

It was once a FTSE 100 Index constituent and the world's second-largest spirits group but has been acquired by Pernod Ricard.


## History

Allied Domecq was the result of a 1994 merger between Allied Lyons and Pedro Domecq S.A. Allied Lyons itself was the result of a 1978 merger between Allied Breweries and the food and catering group J. Lyons and Co. In 1999 the 3,500 strong pub division was sold to Burton-based Punch Taverns for £3bn after a bidding war with Whitbread.

In early 2005, a takeover bid for the company was launched by French-based rival Pernod Ricard S.A. Pernod Ricard successfully completed acquisition on 26 July 2005 and sold off the overlapping spirits brands to U.S.-based competitor Fortune Brands and British-based multinational Diageo. On 12 December 2005, Pernod Ricard announced that it had agreed to sell the restaurant businesses (Dunkin' Brands) to a consortium of three US private equity firms (Thomas H. Lee Partners, the Carlyle Group and Bain Capital LLP) for $2.43 billion. The closing of the sale occurred on 1 March 2006.
