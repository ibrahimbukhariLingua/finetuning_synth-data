# Conseil du Commerce de France



The **French Trade Council** (*Conseil du Commerce de France* – *CdCF*) is an association of twenty-eight professional federations representing both independent and franchised businesses from all sectors.


## Liaison committee

Within the CdCF, trade federations meet to express their views on issues relevant to all sectors of commerce where they pool expertise, identify issues and challenges, and determine plans of action to strengthen French trade.


## Trade representation and advocacy

From the broad issues identified by its members, the CdCF advocates for the interests of all trade professionals to the relevant French or European authorities on issues of taxation, employment, training, environment, consumption, competition, security, accessibility, etc. All these topics are dealt with in the CdCF's committees and work groups, which are places of exchange and consultation for the member federations.
