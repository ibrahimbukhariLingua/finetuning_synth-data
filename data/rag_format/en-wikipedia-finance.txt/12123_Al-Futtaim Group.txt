# Al-Futtaim Group



The **Al-Futtaim Group** (Arabic: مجموعة الفطيم, romanized: *Majmouat al-Futtaim*) is an Emirati conglomerate based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.


## History

The group was founded in the 1930s and expanded rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s becoming an integrated commercial, industrial, and services organization.

The Al-Futtaim family split its business interests in 2000 with Abdulla Al Futtaim controlling the automotive and mainly retail business, and his cousin Majid controlling a property development business (now known as Majid Al Futtaim Group).

In September 2013, the group bid $86 million to take full control of the Nairobi-based car retailer CMC Holdings.


## Operations

Al-Futtaim Group employs over 44,000 people and operates eight divisions comprising automotive, electronics, insurance, services, real estate, retail, industries, and overseas. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum mediated a settlement between Abdulla Al Futtaim and his rival, cousin Majid Al Futtaim, in 2000 which split the assets, liabilities and operations of the then-larger Al Futtaim Group.

The CEO of the group was Robert Willett until he suddenly resigned in January 2011. After that, Omar Al-Futtaim became a board member, CEO and vice chairman.

In September 2022, the group was listed by *Forbes* in the Middle East's Top 100 Arab Family Businesses, ranking third.
