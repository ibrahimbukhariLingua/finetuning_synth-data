Presidential Council of Tax Justice


# Presidential Council of Tax Justice



The **Presidential Council of Tax Justice** (CPGT) is the self-governing body of the Italian tax commissions.


## History

It was introduced by Legislative Decree 31 December 1992, n. 545, in analogy to the High Council of the Judiciary. Its composition was later modified by law 21 November 2000, n. 342, which added the members elected by Parliament in parallel with the provisions of the Constitution for the High Council of the Judiciary. In this way, an attempt was made to release the Presidency Council for tax justice from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the department in which tax magistrates are incardinated who, moreover, unlike other special judges, are honorary magistrates.

The annual report on the progress of tax justice is presented to the Minister of Economy and Finance and not to the Head of State.


## Structure
