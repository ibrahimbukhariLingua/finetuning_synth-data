Paradeplatz


# Paradeplatz



***Paradeplatz*** (lit. 'Parade square') is a square on *Bahnhofstrasse* in downtown Zurich, canton of Zurich, Switzerland. It is one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Switzerland and has become synonymous with wealth and the Swiss banks, being the location of the headquarters of both UBS and Credit Suisse. It is surrounded by four blocks of buildings.


## Constituent buildings

In the block to the north, which is bounded by *Talacker* to the west, *Bahnhofstrasse* to the east and *Paradeplatz* to the south, is the home of Credit Suisse, amongst other businesses. The building, formerly known as the *Kreditanstalt* building, dates to 1873. The *Lichthof* shopping mall is at the eastern corner of the building.

The hotel *Baur en Ville* (now Mandarin Oriental Savoy), on the eastern end of the square, opened in 1838. Also in this block is the Blancpain watch store and the Harry Winston jewellery store. This block is bounded by *Züghusplatz* (lit. 'Armory Square') to the north and *Poststrasse* to the south.

The Confiserie Sprüngli, in the southern block, opened in 1859. It is bounded by *Paradeplatz* to the north, *Bahnhofstrasse* to the east and *Bleicherweg* to the west.

The UBS (formerly *Bankverein*) building on the western side dates to 1897–1899. It is bounded by *Talacker* to the north, *Paradeplatz* to the east and *Bleicherweg* to the south.


## Transportation

*Paradeplatz* is closed to cars, but accessible by tram or on foot.

The square is one of the main nodal points of the Zürich tram network operated by VBZ. The stop is served by lines:

* 2, 8 and 9 to *Stauffacher*
* 6, 7, 11, 13 and 17 to Zürich Hauptbahnhof (Central Railway Station) along the northern part of *Bahnhofstrasse*
* 2, 8, 9 and 11 to *Bürkliplatz* and *Bellevueplatz* along the southern part of *Bahnhofstrasse*
* 6, 7, 13 and 17 to Zürich Enge railway station.

The first horse-drawn trams circulated in 1882 and were electrified in 1896.


## History

The site of the square once lay outside of the medieval city walls, and was incorporated into the town with the construction of the new ramparts in 1642. During the 17th century, it served as a livestock market [de], known as *Säumärt* (lit. 'pig market'). In 1819 it was renamed *Neumarkt* (lit. 'new market', not to be confused with *Neumarkt* in Zurich's old town). In 1865, following the construction of *Bahnhofstrasse*, the square received its current name.

*Paradeplatz* was the scene of clashes between insurgents and cantonal troops during the 1839 Züriputsch (lit. 'Zurich Coup').
