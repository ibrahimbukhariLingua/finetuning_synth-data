Financial Services Trade and Investment Board


# Financial Services Trade and Investment Board



The **Financial Services Trade and Investment Board** (**FSTIB**) is a partnership organization between the UK Government and British industry. It is part of HM Treasury department. The Board meets on a quarterly basis to develop high-growth initiatives such as Renminbi internationalisation, green finance and financial technology. Its aim is to strengthen Britain's position as the centre of global finance and deliver jobs and growth across the country.

The FSTIB works closely with the Financial Services Organisation (FSO). The FSO is a key delivery partner for the FSTIB's initiatives.


## History

The FSTIB was formed by Chancellor George Osborne in Budget 2013 to promote the UK's financial services industry. The Board first met on 8 October 2013 and was charged with leading the government's drive to promote external trade, attract inward investment and lift market access barriers for the UK's financial services sector.

In July 2015, the Chancellor re-launched the FSTIB with a new board composed of senior representatives from across government and industry.
