| 97 | 1 | "Frisky Business" | March 26, 2013 (2013-03-26) |
| Following Joe's arrest in the previous episode, the employees were shaken up by the events. However, they expressed further displeasure when new security measures are implemented to make sure that no one steals anything. But when Seth announced that all employees' bags will be searched upon leaving the store, Les and Ashley thought that he went too far. But that was not far enough when Seth also wanted body searches, which he actually carried out despite Les and Ashley's warnings that it may lead to legal troubles for the store. Also: a man tries to sell a 19th-Century nautical compass for $150, but learns the hard way not to fool with Les when he discovered that that man was selling the same compass online for $33. A woman agreed with Les to sell her Blues Brothers statues for $300, but changed her mind after the deal was made, after her friends told her to hold out for more. A man wanted to buy an electric generator after losing power due to an unpaid bill, but refused to deal with Seth – or even leave the store – when he was unable to take it home to try it out first. And another man, unable to sell his ring because Ashley found it to be fake, found himself thrown onto the floor by Byron, the new head of security, when he tried touching Ashley. | | | | |
| 98 | 2 | "Short Staffed" | April 2, 2013 (2013-04-02) |
| The day after Seth imposed his body search policy on his employees, the ladies that worked the redeem windows all took sick leave, leaving Les and Ashley to believe that the new policy is causing them not to come in. But it would later become possible that they will never return when an employee told Ashley in a phone call that Seth's new policies may cause her to quit. | | | | |
| 99 | 3 | "Monster Deals" | April 9, 2013 (2013-04-09) |
| After Seth rescinded his invasive search policies for American Jewelry's employees, the ladies that worked the redeem windows return to work. But Seth has a new problem – profits are down, and he is looking for creative ways to get new customers into the store. Ashley has an idea that she tried out – an inflatable gorilla with a banner reading "monster deals". However, Seth has a better promotional plan, which would explain why a couple of customers told Ashley to quit. | | | | |
| 100 | 4 | "Tipped Off" | April 16, 2013 (2013-04-16) |
| The staff had been receiving complaints from customers that a staff member had been letting customers cut in line in exchange for a $3 tip. They would later find out that Anton, who works the pawn desk, had been doing the evil deed. Les had decided to let Anton off with a warning, as he had been with American Jewelry for several years and is otherwise a trusted employee. However, Seth wanted Anton fired, as he was still burned over another trusted employee who was later arrested for theft – Joe the head of security. | | | | |
| 101 | 5 | "Redeem Girl Rumble" | April 23, 2013 (2013-04-23) |
| Noticing that one of the employees was discontent with working the same redeem window each day, Seth decides to have them work different windows. However, Les becomes angered at the situation, as he felt that the arrangement was good enough as it was. But his own discontent falls on deaf ears when Seth insists on keeping the new assignments, leading to the employees to come close to fighting, and Ashley to play the role of peacekeeper. | | | | |
| 102 | 6 | "Busted" | April 30, 2013 (2013-04-30) |
| Jeff calls in sick, leading to Seth to order everyone to stay away from Jeff's desk in any circumstance. But when he caught Bobby J. near Jeff's desk, polishing a ring for a customer, he almost fires him, only to rescind the dismissal when Bobby J. told Seth that Les gave him permission to polish the ring. This led to Seth's argument with Les, in which he said that the policy applies to everyone, leading to Les to determine that Seth had become more security-hungry following Joe's arrest, and Ashley wishing that both men stop the bickering. | | | | |
| 103 | 7 | "Watch Your Back" | May 7, 2013 (2013-05-07) |
| Les sells a valuable Breitling watch for $42,000 to a trusted watch collector that he dealt with many times before; however, he did not have the cash at the moment, so Les gave him the watch in exchange for an IOU. Seth, however, had misgivings about the deal. The man later said that someone else will pay him the money as he leaves out of town; Seth still had bad feelings about it, but Les still has trust in the customer. But Les would end up getting an expensive lesson in trust when the customer pays him for the watch – with over 40,000 watchbands. | | | | |
| 104 | 8 | "American Jewelry & Zoo" | June 4, 2013 (2013-06-04) |
| Following the debacle involving the 40,000 watchbands, delivered in over 100 boxes, American Jewelry has found themselves with limited space for anything else – this includes "antiques" and "collectibles" that Les buys, but Seth and Ashley thinks are worthless junk, such as a 1950s salesman's sample model of an above ground swimming pool, a Christmas display from the old J. L. Hudson Department Store, and several taxidermied animals. The kids think the "junk" would not sell, and neither would the watchbands, but Les tries to prove them wrong, starting with a taxidermied boar's head. Also: a woman in labor and without a job buys an old rocking horse for her child from Ashley at a special rate, with Ashley covering the difference, but it ended up being a scam when her false belly fell out. And a man attempts to get a refund without receipt for a store brand "Cherokee" watch that he passed off as a "Rolex". | | | | |
| 105 | 9 | "Les Sells Out" | June 11, 2013 (2013-06-11) |
| With over 40,000 wristbands to sell and stored in 130 boxes, Les decides to sell the watchbands one by one, starting at $2 apiece. While Seth and Ashley remained skeptical of the whole idea, they did not realise that in the end, all it takes is a little showmanship – and some friends in the business. | | | | |
| 106 | 10 | "You Bet Your Butt" | June 18, 2013 (2013-06-18) |
| Seth and Ashley each make a series of bets to see if either of them, or Les, can purchase any item that comes into the store that they would otherwise dismiss as "junk", including a "Major Savings" mascot costume and a rusted out Mobil Oil Pegasus logo. But when a set of first-class airline seats (the actual seats, not tickets) come into the shop, they get Les involved in the wager to see whether or not the seats will be bought – the loser will take over the janitor's job for the final hour of the day. | | | | |
| 107 | 11 | "Homefront Heat" | June 25, 2013 (2013-06-25) |
| Seth notices that Ashley was low-balling on, or rejecting outright, various items that he would otherwise give higher deals on. In addition, the deals were often broken due to Ashley's rudeness. But when Seth's interference angers Ashley, Les intervenes in order to make peace. Also: a crazy man brings in a bass fiddle case, but the item inside is not a bass fiddle, and the man would not let Les look inside. | | | | |
| 108 | 12 | "Strike Out" | July 2, 2013 (2013-07-02) |
| Ashley continues to lowball and mistreat customers to Seth's detriment, but an argument in front of a customer over a signed 1970 Detroit Tigers baseball, which led to the customer walking out and calling the two "unprofessional", has led Les to the end of his rope, to a point where he sends both of them home the rest of the day. However, the kids' frequent bickering may be harming not only his business, it may also affect his health. | | | | |
| 109 | 13 | "Les Goes Down" | July 9, 2013 (2013-07-09) |
| The day after Les' anger over Seth and Ashley's sibling rivalry boiled over, he gave them an ultimatum – if the bickering does not stop, they will be fired. However, the infighting continued anyway, to a point where they neglected to restock the TVs, leading to an unhappy customer literally tossed out of the store by Byron, and to Les and Bobby J restocking the TVs themselves. But during the day, the infighting had affected Les' health, to a point where he collapsed in the warehouse while handling the TVs for restocking. | | | | |
| 110 | 14 | "Bad Trouble Here" | July 30, 2013 (2013-07-30) |
| While Les remains in hospital following his collapse, Seth and Ashley jointly took over operations at the pawn shop; however, the bickering continues, to a point where Ashley takes over Les' office. However, they later find out that nothing will keep Les in the hospital for long – not even a hernia (which was what he actually collapsed from). While he was convalescing, Les had thought of a solution to end the infighting once and for all – whoever of the two does the best job that day will become manager. | | | | |
| 111 | 15 | "The Trouble with Michael" | August 6, 2013 (2013-08-06) |
| Michael is a regular customer at American Jewelry, but the feeling is not mutual among the clerks, as everything he brought in was all but worthless. Ashley does not want him back anymore, and Bobby J especially has a hatred toward Michael, but Seth says otherwise, in the event that Michael actually had something of value. However, when Michael offered a car without a title, Seth felt that he was at the end of his rope – until Michael offered a gold chain that might bring in thousands of dollars. Also: speed painter Dave Santia tries to paint Les' portrait in ten minutes in hopes to get money. | | | | |
| 112 | 16 | "Seth in Charge" | August 13, 2013 (2013-08-13) |
| Seth, who is Les' hand-picked manager, had an idea in order to speed up the lines and improve efficiency – give out pawn tickets and cash in the same line, instead of separate lines for each. However, Seth's plan had resulted in longer lines and irate customers, to a point where Les reconsiders having Seth in charge. | | | | |
| 113 | 17 | "Back in Action" | August 20, 2013 (2013-08-20) |
| Les, now fully back in charge following his hernia operation, puts the staff on notice that everyone's job is at risk – including Seth and Ashley, who Les says contributed to a drop in American Jewelry's revenue in all departments. Because of that, he placed both on probation, subject to the close, watchful eye of Les, and would remain there until Les determines that they can do their work properly. | | | | |

| A couple of young men inform Les and Seth that their computer was stolen by one of their employees as part of a scam, in which not only they would get cash for pawning their computer, they would also get the computer back then and there. However, Ashley uncovered evidence that proved that the real scammers are the "victims". | | | | |
| 115 | 19 | "Seth Snaps" | September 3, 2013 (2013-09-03) |
| Since Ashley resumed being a manager, she felt that she had every right to order Seth around, as he was still on probation. However, Ashley's regimental behavior was concerning Les, thinking that she is being a little too rough on Seth – this included her criticizing Seth for buying things that she felt would all but take up space. But things come to a head when Ashley buys a 1950s Eljer toilet for $10, leading to Seth to buy it for $20, just so he can destroy it with a sledgehammer, before abruptly leaving the store angry. | | | | |
| 116 | 20 | "Computer Crash" | September 10, 2013 (2013-09-10) |
| Following his flip out in the previous episode, Seth chose to stay home. But when the computer system goes down, Seth has no choice but to come in and repair the system. But when an irate customer, who was already frustrated with having to wait until the system goes back up in order to redeem his pawn of a ring, he was given a wrong ring, owing to duplicate numbers on the pawn slips.

| 117 | 21 | "All-American Jewelry and Loan" | September 17, 2013 (2013-09-17) |

Knowing that the ball would be worth tens of thousands of dollars if genuine, Seth takes a risk and gives the Reverend a $1000 deposit, while he has it sent out to be verified.

The watch was sent to Tiffany to verify it, but they refused to take a look at it unless they own the watch. However, the man asks for $40,000 – the value of the insurance that Tiffany purchased to send it back – but says that he could get $100,000 for it. This led to Les trying to make a $150,000 bet that the man would not get more than $40,000 for the watch. | | | | |
| 119 | 23 | "Gold Crash" | October 15, 2013 (2013-10-15) |

| 121 | 25 | "The Outsider" | October 29, 2013 (2013-10-29) |
| With the price of gold continuing to drop and the store still losing money, Seth determines that part of the problem resides in purchasing items that are slow- or no-sellers, a cluttered sales floor, and a 50,000 square foot warehouse that is overloaded with junk that Les refuses to part with. To help solve the problem, Seth brings in a consultant to determine the best solution to the problem. But while everyone was interested in what he was saying, the only person who was reluctant to any change was Les. | | | | |
| 122 | 26 | "Seth's Secret" | November 5, 2013 (2013-11-05) |

| After Les secretly found out that Seth was at Bill's Pawn Shop, Les confronted him, asking Seth why he would betray the family by visiting a competing pawn shop. Seth explained the real reason: he was branching out into consulting as a sideline – the very thing that another person that Seth hired tried to do for American Jewelry earlier. As being a consultant is tantamount to disclosing family secrets to strangers, Les gives Seth a choice: "Family, or nothing." | | | | |

Les agreed, but to Seth's chagrin, Les had Ashley join the department as co-manager with Seth. However, Ashley included items that were not supposed to be for sale on the list of items to be sold – including the Olympic torch from the 2002 Winter Games (featured in Season 4 episode "Fire Bomb"), which not only ended up being sold, it also ended up being lost in transit, making Seth even more livid. | | | | |

After Les found out about what happened, he found both Seth and Ashley at fault, leading him to take over the online department himself.

| Ashley was overcome by an inferiority complex when she thought that Les was favoring Karen more than her, especially when Les decided to trim down on the gold jewelry and increase the stock of stainless steel jewelry, as he felt that gold had fallen in demand while the demand for stainless steel had demand increased. This motivated her to, as a way to win back his favor, buy a bronze bust of Les, which a customer made as a method of arthritis therapy, for $1000 – a price that Seth felt was too high. | | | | |
