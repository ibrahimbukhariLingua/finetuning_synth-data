During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, ProPublica reported the company received between $41.7 and $97 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. PPP is designed for small companies and has a maximum of $10 million loan value, but Vibra received the loans split between 26 LLCs at the same address. 23 of the LLCs were funded by Orrstown Bank, and almost all were funded on the same day. Vibra also received $13 million in health care grants from CARES act and $41 million in Medicare payment advances.


## Hospitals and subsidiaries

As of 2006 Vibra leases ten facilities from Medical Properties Trust (MPT), a REIT; three are inpatient rehabilitation and seven are for long-term acute care. The leases are triple-net leases. Some were purchased by Vibra, immediately sold to MPT, and leased from MPT in a leaseback arrangement.

Vibra also operates facilities that were sold under triple-net leaseback to the MedEquities Realty Trust REIT (MRT), and others that were purchased with mortgage loans from MRT. By 2015, Vibra was approximately 25% of MRT's revenue.
