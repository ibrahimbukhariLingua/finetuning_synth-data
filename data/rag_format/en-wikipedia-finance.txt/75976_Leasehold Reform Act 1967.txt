Leasehold Reform Act 1967


# Leasehold Reform Act 1967



The **Leasehold Reform Act 1967** (c. 88) is an act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, which concerns English land law and compulsory purchase. A government bill, the law remains largely intact. It was passed by both Houses and had been tabled by ministers of the Labour government, 1964–1970.


## Provisions and subsequent amendments

The act grants the right to long leaseholders of houses let at low and moderately low rents to buy their homes compulsorily from their landlords at a fair price.

Initially the 1967 act applied only to homes below these rateable values: £400 p.a. in London and £200 p.a. elsewhere (thus targeting low-to-middle income homeowners); the reform coincided with lower wages becoming less of a bar to access to loans from major mortgage lenders. The act has since been amended on a number of occasions to expand these rights, to homeowners having higher rateable values.


## Background

English law and lending eschews the concept of flying freehold entire properties, such as flats. The solution was to set up a standard model of any flat ownership based on landlord and tenant but which is not seen in much of Europe where a more commonhold system of ownership is common, as long-term flat owners wish to gain a greater than 'transient' or 'time-barred' interest in their home. Such long leases were already in use in housing, as before purpose-built apartments were built, an aristocratic or other large capitalist landlord could co-steer the successful, competitive development of their urban estates; these took the initial form of "building leases" then leases to allow the flexibility of the landlord deciding whether to create apartments, extensions, shorter-term lettings all of which liberties have been tempered by law or by secured lending codes to enhance the status of long-term lessees. The dozen or so private great collections of reversions continue the landlord-tenant relation with piecemeal reductions, across the Central London grander residential zones, in the leasehold valuation tribunals referred to as "Prime Central London".
