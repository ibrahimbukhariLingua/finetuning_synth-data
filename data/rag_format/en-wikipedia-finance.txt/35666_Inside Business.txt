Inside Business


# Inside Business



***Inside Business*** is an Australian television program that was broadcast on ABC1. Making its debut on 4 August 2002, it presented analysis of the financial world, including the Australian share market, business activities and the broader economy. The program aired at 9:30 am on Sunday mornings following *Insiders,* and was hosted by Alan Kohler. He also conducted interviews with members of the business community, profiled emerging businesses and entrepreneurs, and often presented his own commentary at the end of the program. Neheda Barakat was the show's founding executive producer between June 2002 and June 2004. The show switched from reporting to a talk show format similar to *Insiders* on 5 February 2012.

The show was criticized by fellow ABC network program *Media Watch* for providing uncritical promotion of a floral company on its profile segment, a claim which the program denied. The issue is particularly pertinent as the ABC network carries no advertising.
The show was also repeated on weekday mornings at 8:00 am on ABC2

The show was cancelled by the ABC as from the end of the 2013 season, after Kohler announced his retirement from the show due to his wish to lessen his workload.
