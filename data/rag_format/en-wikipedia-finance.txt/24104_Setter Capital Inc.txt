## Setter Liquidity Rating

Generally, a ‘Good’ rating suggests that there are many potential buyers, (typically 20+) that are interested to bid on a fund within the fund family. ‘Very Good’ and ‘Excellent’ denote progressively stronger potential demand. ‘Unrated’ fund families are less targeted by buyers and/or have fewer buyers within their existing investor base or for which there is simply not enough data points because they rarely come up for sale.”
