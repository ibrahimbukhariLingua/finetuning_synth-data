## The Walther Collection

From the early 1990s onward, Walther traveled extensively and expanded the collection to include photography and video art from Asia – specifically China – and Africa, incorporating major works and series by, among others, Ai Weiwei, Zhang Dali, Samuel Fosso, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, David Goldblatt, Seydou Keïta, Santu Mofokeng, J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere, Wang Qingsong, Jo Ractliffe, Song Dong, Mikhael Subotzky, Guy Tillim, Malick Sidibé, and Zhang Huan.

In June 2010, Artur Walther opened his collection to the public with the inauguration of The Walther Collection, a four-building museum complex in a residential area of Neu-Ulm/Burlafingen, Germany. Supported by the Walther Family Foundation, The Walther Collection is dedicated to promoting new scholarship through an in-depth exhibition and publication program. The inaugural exhibition, *Events of the Self: Portraiture and Social Identity*, was organized by Okwui Enwezor and integrated the work of three generations of African photographers with selections of modern and contemporary German photography.

The second annual exhibition, *Appropriated Landscapes*, was organized by Corinne Diserens. The exhibition opened in June 2011, featuring photography and video exploring the effects of war, migration, energy, architecture, and memory on the landscapes of Southern Africa. The collection's third exhibition on African photography, *Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive*, opened in June 2013. Curated by Tamar Garb, *Distance and Desire* brings together late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century photography from Southern and Eastern Africa, set in dialogue with recent photography and video by artists engaging with the archive. *Events of the Self*, *Appropriated Landscapes*, and *Distance and Desire* are accompanied by exhibition catalogues co-published by Steidl.

Walther opened a second exhibition venue, The Walther Collection Project Space, in New York in April 2011. In New York, Walther has presented exhibitions on Jo Ractliffe, August Sander, Seydou Keïta, Rotimi Fani-Kayode, and the three-part exhibition series *Distance and Desire: Encounters with the African Archive*. With over 1,400 works, the Walther Collection is considered one of the most significant holdings of contemporary Chinese and African photography in the world.
