## National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need

Tsahi Merkur initiated and founded the National Centre for Charity and Aid for those in Need, which operates voluntarily and with the funding of Merkur.

As part of the project, an innovative global donation system is being developed that will improve the level of transparency and the efficiency of charity organizations and foundations, and will enable the increase in the amount of donations that can be raised by non-profit organizations and charities, that manage to channel the donations to them in the best possible manner for the ultimate goal for which the donors initially intended to contribute, and also directly to those in need who will be able to reach the hearts of the donors .


## Better Place

Better Place is an international operation of electric vehicles established by
Shai Agassi and Idan Ofer, chairman of the Israel Corporation. After failing to raise additional funds, Better Place requested the court to appoint a liquidator, and in July 2013 the court approved the recommendation of the temporary liquidators to sell the company's activity and assets in Israel to the Sunrise group for NIS 18 Million. and without payment of an advance payment.

At the end of August 2013, the temporary liquidators appealed to the court to cancel the sale to the Sunrise group, and to sell the activity to Success Assets. However, this sale as well was cancelled at the request of the liquidators, out of a series of 4 consecutive sales transactions that were cancelled for four different buyers. Merkur appealed to the Supreme Court to cancel the decision to cancel the transaction, but until the appeal was heard in March 2014, the company's assets were already sold in parts, and there was no longer any reason to hear the appeal while the sale could not be re-established. The Supreme Court ruled that Merkur's Success Assets were entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the transaction.
