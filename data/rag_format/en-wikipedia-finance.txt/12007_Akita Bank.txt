**The Akita Bank, Ltd.** (株式会社秋田銀行, *Kabushiki-gaisha Akita Ginkō*) (TYO: 8343) is a Japanese regional bank headquartered in the city of Akita, Akita Prefecture. Although the bank’s core business comes from Akita prefecture, various branches are situated outside of the area. These include Koriyama, Sapporo, Morioka, Sendai, and Tokyo. The bank was noted for its initial reluctance to establish a wide ATM network, finally implementing one in January 2003.
