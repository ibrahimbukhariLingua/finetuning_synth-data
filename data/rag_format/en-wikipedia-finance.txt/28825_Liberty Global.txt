## History

Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global.

United International Holding, later called UGC, acquired 50% of UPC from Dutch electronic concern Philips in 1995, and 100% in 1997.
