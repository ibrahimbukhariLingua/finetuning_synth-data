The Power of Unreasonable People


# The Power of Unreasonable People



***The Power of Unreasonable People: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Markets that Change the World*** is a 2008 non-fiction book written by John Elkington and Pamela Hartigan and published by Harvard Business School . The title of the book is based on a quote from Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw: "The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man." The book focuses on two groups of "Unreasonable People": social entrepreneurs and environmental entrepreneurs.³

### Creating the Markets of the Future

The second section of the book discusses some of the steps necessary to create successful markets. It discusses the identification of market opportunities and raising expectations. Poverty is also discussed, specifically why many of the new social businesses and NGOs are focusing on the bottom of the pyramid markets.⁸⁵–¹³³
Pierre Omidyar, founder of the huge internet marketplace eBay was quoted in saying, “…if you want to have global impact you can’t ignore business…but (aim to create) business models that provoke social change…”. This leads to the exploration of social entrepreneurs who are not averse to making a profit, but think outside the box when it comes to improving communities. Rather than simply distributing aid, social entrepreneurs focus on partnering with members of poorer communities to help them create solutions to their problems using sustainable means - means that are reliant on the abilities of members of those communities rather than the generosity of others.


### Creating Sustainable and Scalable Change
