On the issue of the coronavirus crisis, he warned in 2020 that if it lasted more than a few months, "Tens of millions of jobs could be lost despite trillions of dollars being spent on saving businesses and industries". Furthermore, it could be "the kiss of death for countries and the stability of their financial systems".


## Findings on the Greek banking crisis

Avgouleas was critical of early attempts to stabilize the Greek banking sector during the banking crisis after a bailout by the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2010. In 2014, he delivered a paper on ethics and restoring confidence at a conference organised by the Hellenic Bank Association, Greece’s national banking trade group. That same year he published a "critical evaluation" of bank bail-in regimes with Charles Goodhart. In 2015, he described the disposal of banking assets as "a fire sale", resulting in an "enormous loss" for Greek taxpayers.

Avgouleas was appointed in January 2016 as an independent member of a selection and evaluation panel for board members of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, and contributed to the interim and final financial reports. He returned to the issue of bank bail-ins with Goodhart at the end of the year.

In May 2018, he worked on a Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) report that began: "A spectre continues to haunt Greece and no less its creditors." It then discussed debt relief, and how schemes could be structured so as to provide the right incentives for budgetary discipline. He also contributed to a CEPR commentary that characterised Greece’s third economic programme as "unlike its two predecessors" in being "relatively successful". In late 2018, he said a "radical" move by the Greek central bank to buy up non-performing loans held by the country’s banks "has to be welcomed".

In a *Financial Times* article about addressing Greek bank debt, he pointed to a high level of non-performing loans compared with other EU member states. This came after "a long period of inertia by bank boards and regulatory authorities" as a result of "close relationships between politicians, bankers and favoured businessmen".

At the end of 2019, Avgouleas said that Greece needed infrastructure investment from China after 10 years of financial devastation: "Its stock of capital investment has to be replenished. The only available capital investors are the Chinese."

A 2020 paper with economist Rym Ayadi proposing a technology-driven private-public initiative to enhance debt transparency and management in low-income and lower-middle-income countries was published as a G20 Insights policy brief.
