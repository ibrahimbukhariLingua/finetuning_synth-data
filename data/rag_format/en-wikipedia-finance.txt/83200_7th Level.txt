7th Level


# 7th Level



**7th Level** was a video game development company based in Dallas, Texas and founded in 1993. Notable game titles by the company include: the three Monty Python games (with the aid of Python member Eric Idle); *G-Nome* (1997), a *MechWarrior*-style game; *Helicops* (1997), an anime-inspired game that featured arcade-style aerial combat; and *Tracer,* a game where the player hacked computer systems distributed for cash by using a virtual avatar in the design of *Neuromancer*, *Shadowrun*, or *Snowcrash-*styled virtual worlds.


## History

On February 24, 1995, 7th Level announced that they have acquired Distant Thunder Entertainment, Inc., a Dallas-based game developer specializing in 3-D games. The same year the company acquired Lanpro Corp. and Lanpro Localization Center Inc., based in San Francisco, Calif., who localize interactive entertainment and educational multimedia software.

On March 1, 1996, 7th Level announced that they have acquired PyroTechnix, a privately held company based in Cincinnati, Ohio. The company grew to nearly 300 employees in Texas, California, Ohio, and Europe by June 1996.

On November 17, 1997, 7th Level announced their intention to merge with Pulse Entertainment, in order to create P7 Solutions. The following day, the distribution rights for the three Monty Python games were acquired by Panasonic Interactive Media, which ended 7th Level's involvement with the game's development and publishing. The merger announced between 7th Level and Pulse Entertainment was cancelled in April 1998.

In February 1999, 7th Level merged with Street Technologies Inc. and formed a website named 7th Street.com, which later became learn.com, tutorials.com, and Taleo, which was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2012. George Grayson, the co-founder of 7th Level, later founded The Imagination Station.

Before ceasing all game development, 7th Level had begun working on another title, named *Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3*. The partially-completed game was sold to Ion Storm to finish development.
