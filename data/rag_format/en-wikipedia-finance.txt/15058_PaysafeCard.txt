# PaysafeCard



**PaysafeCard** (until 2024 stylized *paysafecard*) is part of Paysafe Limited (“Paysafe”) (NYSE: PSFE) (PSFE.WS), a global payments platform. PaysafeCard is a prepaid cash-based, online payment method based on vouchers with a 16-digit PIN code. The vouchers can be used to fund online transactions without a bank account, credit card, or other personal information.

Users can purchase vouchers at local sales outlets or online via their myPaysafe account and entering the code at the checkout of the respective website (e.g. an online gaming provider). PaysafeCard codes can only be used at authorised online shops and should not be shared on marketplaces, by mail or telephone.

As of 2024 PaysafeCard is available in approximately 50 countries with scope of services and partner webshops varying by country. In most countries, a personal account called myPaysafe is available for uploading codes and managing balances.

paysafecard started in Austria in 2000 as a company in its own right. Two former competitors, Dutch *Wallie* and British Ukash, were acquired by paysafecard. In 2013, paysafecard was acquired by the digital wallet provider Skrill. In 2015 the Skrill Group was acquired by the *Optimal Payments Group*, a global online payment processing provider regulated in the United Kingdom. Optimal Payments subsequently rebranded as *Paysafe*. paysafecard continued to be a subsidiary brand of the Paysafe Group in its own right, alongside others like the digital wallets Skrill and Neteller. In 2024, stylization of the prepaid product changed to *PaysafeCard*.

## History


### Early years

The company behind paysafecard is based in Vienna, Austria. It was founded in 2000 by four Austrians, including the first CEO Armin Sageder, as *paysafecard.com Wertkarten AG* ("paysafecard.com prepaid card Inc."), later transferred into a GmbH, a private limited company. The technical partner providing expertise and the original hardware was IBM Austria. The following year, paysafecard also launched in Germany. In 2004, co-founder Michael Müller assumed the role of CEO.

In 2005, paysafecard received an EU funding under the *eTEN* program supporting electronic services with a trans-European dimension. Subsequently, paysafecard launched in Slovenia, Greece, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom.
In 2008, British subsidiary *Prepaid Services Company Ltd.* received an EU-wide e-money licence by the British Financial Services Authority (FSA), later the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, expanding to a *small e-money issuers certificate* valid for the United Kingdom in 2006.
This authorised the company to issue e-money throughout the European Union.
Also in 2008, paysafecard Switzerland obtained a license as a financial intermediary.


### Acquisitions

In August 2011, paysafecard acquired Dutch competitor Wallie. In February 2013, Skrill, one of the largest payment services providers in Europe completed the acquisition of paysafecard.com Wertkarten AG. A year later, CEO Michael Müller left paysafecard and handed over to his brother Udo Müller. In November 2014, Skrill acquired British paysafecard competitor Ukash and merged it into paysafecard. In August 2015, Skrill group competitor *Optimal Payments* group completed the acquisition of Skrill group, including paysafecard, and subsequently rebranded as *Paysafe Group*. On the 1st of November 2021, Paysafe completed the acquisition of viafintech, the company that developed viacash (originally Barzahlen).


## Functionality


### Basic function

A paysafecard voucher is a 16-digit code sold in stores and online. Sales outlets print the voucher as a receipt. In the respective countries, paysafecard is available in denominations ranging from 10 to 100 euros, United States dollars, pounds sterling, and Australian dollars, and approximately equivalent sums in other currencies, e. g. 100-1000 Norwegian kroner.

When paying in an online shop, the user enters the 16-digit code, and the amount tendered is deducted from the paysafecard balance. Hence, the same code can be used multiple times until the full balance has been used. For larger sums, it is possible to combine multiple paysafecard codes.

The current balance of each paysafecard, as well as its transaction history and purchase date, can be viewed at the official site by entering the respective code.


### Issuing

In contrast to in-house vouchers and prepaid products, paysafecard is sold and accepted at distinct companies ("Third Party Billing"). For this reason, dealing with them is a banking transaction and requires either a banking partner or a banking licence. In the beginning, paysafecard was issued by the BAWAG P.S.K. in Austria and the Commerzbank in Germany.

Since 2008, paysafecard's subsidiary company *Prepaid Services Company Limited* holds a licence of the Financial Conduct Authority (resp. its predecessor Financial Services Authority) "to issue electronic money (e-money) and provide payment services", valid for all countries in the European Economic Area. Therefore in those countries, paysafecard is issued by *Prepaid Services* without external banking partner. Further, Swiss paysafecard subsidiary *paysafecard.com Schweiz GmbH* is a licensed financial intermediary in Switzerland and issuer of the product also in other countries, e.g. in Australia.

In the United States, payment regulations require an external banking partner issuing paysafecard, a role assumed by *The Bancorp Bank*.


### Distribution

In the beginning, paysafecard was sold as a pre-printed scratchcard. Starting in 2002, paysafecard was sold as a printout called "eVoucher" by the company, a uniquely numbered receipt from an in-store sales terminal. paysafecard is distributed countrywide by various external partners, which is why the types of shops offering paysafecard vary by country. Typical examples include newsagents, petrol stations, post offices, pharmacies, supermarkets, electrical retailers and vending machines. The worldwide number of points of sales is more than 600,000.


### Limitations

paysafecard has limitations manifesting especially when used for online gambling. Payments (deposits in gambling accounts) with paysafecard are limited to €1000; for classic paysafecard (not *myPaysafe*) this amount has been lowered to €250 in 2016 due to compliance with regulations. Some other online payment methods allow higher amounts. Also, a myPaysafe account is required to withdraw money from a gambling merchant. Withdrawals to myPaysafe accounts are supported by several online casinos, with Paysafe's President of Global Gaming, Zak Cutler, emphasising that consumer protection and safety is a focus of its casino withdrawal offering.

Unlike credit cards, paysafecard does not give the opportunity to overdraw user funds.


### Additional services

The company offers services to supplement the classic paysafecard. In most countries, an online account called myPaysafe lets users buy codes and carry out repeat payments more comfortably. At the checkout of a webshop, users may choose between entering a code and signing in to their *myPaysafe* account. myPaysafe also offers gift card purchases – users can use their balance to buy retail and entertainment gift cards from the likes of Amazon, Nintendo or H&M.

In several countries, paysafecard also issues a prepaid *paysafecard Mastercard*.

In 2023, the company started offering a service called ‘Account & Card’, which provides a myPaysafe account with a virtual IBAN together with a physical or virtual prepaid card. The service lets users make SEPA transfers with their account balance but is only available in certain countries.


## PaysafeCash

Barcode (e-Cash) payment solution **PaysafeCash** was launched in 2018 by paysafecard. It is based on a barcode generated in the online checkout of an app, account, wallet or webshop when PaysafeCash has been chosen as the post payment or deposit option. The generated barcode can be sent to a mobile phone via a text message or an e-mail, uploaded to a mobile wallet, or printed out. The user shows the barcode at the nearest PaysafeCash payment store, where it is scanned and the amount due can be paid with cash. Payment stores are to be found via a location finder within the PaysafeCash app or on the PaysafeCash webpage.

PaysafeCash was created for cash-reliant users who do not possess a credit or debit card, or do not want to disclose their financial data when making online purchases or paying bills. It allows the use of traditional cash for digital payments in multiple industries such as financial services, rent payments, government and utility bills, e-commerce, and others. Retail and neobanks can offer new services to their customers, a PaysafeCash integration in their banking app provides an option for cash deposits to digital bank accounts at a brick-and-mortar store.


### Geographical extension

As of 2022, PaysafeCash is available in about 30 countries in Europe and North America.


### Acceptance

PaysafeCash is accepted in more than 200,000 brick-and-mortar PaysafeCash partner stores globally.


### Functionality

Users select PaysafeCash in the online checkout page as their desired payment or deposit method, load the generated barcode into their wallet, send it to their mobile phone or print it out.

They can then find the nearest PaysafeCash payment store using the online search function. Once the barcode is scanned by the cashier at the payment store, the sum can be paid in cash.


### Recent developments

In August 2023, Paysafe announced an extended partnership with The Mill Adventure enabling players on the German-licensed iGaming platform to pay for their gaming experience in cash.
