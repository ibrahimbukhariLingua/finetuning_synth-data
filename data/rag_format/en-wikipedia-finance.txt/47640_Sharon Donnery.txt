While in a consumer protection leadership role, she was Chair of the European Banking Authority's (EBA) Consumer Protection Group and Vice-Chair of the EBA Standing Committee on Consumer Protection and Financial Innovation; she later continued involvement in international policy-making. She was subsequently promoted to Director of Credit Institutions Supervision in 2014, succeeding Fiona Muldoon.

The group produced ECB guidance on Non-Performing Loans and a review of relevant practices across Europe. She was appointed Chair of the ECB's Budget Committee in 2016 - this being one of only two ECB committees not chaired by an ECB executive - succeeding Pentti Hakkarainen.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

According to media reporting, Donnery was one of five shortlisted candidates for the post of Governor, with Gabriel Makhlouf ultimately appointed and taking up the role from 1 September 2019.
