## History

During the late nineteenth century, the building site had been the home of the Denison Hotel. The building was developed as **First Indiana Plaza** by Indianapolis-based Phillip R. Duke and Associates and construction was started in mid 1986 following the demolition of the seven-story Denison Parking garage on the site. When the building opened in April 1988, it served as the headquarters of the First Indiana Federal Savings Bank, the building's major tenant. In September 2008, the building was renamed M&I Plaza following the acquisition of First Indiana by Marshall & Ilsley Corporation earlier that year. Three years later, the building changed name a second time to BMO Plaza. In 2018, it was sold to a new owner for $70 million.
