National Pig Association


# National Pig Association



The **National Pig Association** is the trade association for the pig industry in the UK.


## History

It was formed in October 1999 from the British Pig Association commercial committee and the NFU pig committee.


### British pig industry

The British pig industry has faced economic hardship. In 2007 the NPA calculated that British farmers lose £26 for every pig they produce, when there was a large increase in the cost of animal feed. This led to the BPA contributing to a campaign song entitled *Stand By Your Ham*, a remake of the country music song *Stand by Your Man*, under the banner of *Pigs are worth it*. This was at a time when there was estimated to be 1,500 pig farmers in the UK who received around £1.10 per kilogram of pork.

In 2011, the NPA calculated that on average British pig farmers were losing £21 per pig they produce. In total British pig farmers are losing £4 million per week, with processors of pig meat making £8 million a week, and pig meat retailers making £16 million a week.


## Structure

It is based in Stoneleigh Park, the site of the NFU. Its members represent 70% of the British pig industry.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
