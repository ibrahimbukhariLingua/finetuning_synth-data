## Business mission

The SozialBank offers all services and products of a universal bank. However, it is a specialized commercial bank in regards to its limited range of customers. The consulting is focused on the traditional business and includes not only banking specific aspects but also financing terms and conditions of health and social management. Those are especially shaped by social insurances and social legislation. In addition, the bank offers branch specific products such as social economic mezzanine fonds, online-factoring and services for donation-based organizations.

Services like production site and competitor analysis for care homes, feasibility studies, collateral value assessments and valuation reports, a wide-ranging seminar program as well as publications and presentations on the latest legal and economic issues in the health and social management sector are also on offer at SozialBank.

SozialBank operates in 16 locations in Germany (Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt, Essen, Hamburg, Hanover, Karlsruhe, Kassel, Cologne, Leipzig, Magdeburg, Mainz, Munich, Nuremberg, Rostock, Stuttgart) and runs a European office in Brussels.

## Anti-Semitism accusation

The Simon Wiesenthal Center listed the bank in its annual list of the ten worst global anti-Semitism incidents (after 1945) in 2018. The reason was an account that it held which led to the European Jews for a Just Peace (EJJP). According to various sources,ʷʰⁱᶜʰ? this group of Jews and Israelis is linked to Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions. The account was terminated, which in turn also attracted protests. Because of this event, the bank commissioned Juliane Wetzel, a staff member of the Berlin Center for Research on Antisemitism, to examine whether or not the "Jewish Voice", a German EJJP member organization, was anti-Semitic. This also sparked protests: Iris Hefets, of the executive committee of the "Jewish Voice", revolted in January 2019 that her organization, consisting exclusively of Jews, on behalf of a German bank should be found as "guilty or acquitted of anti-Semitism by a German expert". In a press statement, the bank decisively rejected the reproach of the anti-Semitism. It has no business relationship with the BDS campaign, nor does it support its objectives: "Boycotting aimed at destabilizing the state of Israel is incompatible with our corporate policies. The BDS campaign would never get an account with us."
