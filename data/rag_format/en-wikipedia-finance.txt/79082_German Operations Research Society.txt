German Operations Research Society


# German Operations Research Society



The **Gesellschaft für Operations Research (GOR)** is the professional non-profit society for the scientific field of Operations Research in Germany. The society is a member of the European umbrella organization, the Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO), and of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).


## History

The history of the present-day society began in 1956 with the foundation of the Working Group Operations Research (Arbeitskreis Operations Research, AKOR) which was fairly practically orientated. In 1961, the German Society for Operations Research (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unternehmensforschung, DGU) with a rather academic background was founded. Both societies merged in 1972 and became the German Operations Research Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Operations Research, DGOR).

By the end of the 1970s some members with a theoretical focus did not find anymore their interests enough represented by the rather practical DGOR. Hence, they founded the Society for Mathematics, Economics and Operations Research (Gesellschaft für Mathematik, Ökonomie und Operations Research, GMÖOR) in 1979. From 1995 on, they again realized common conferences. On January 1, 1998, both societies joined for today's Society for Operations Research (Gesellschaft für Operations Research, GOR).


## Governance

The society's affairs are managed by an executive board of four members, including the president. Its affairs are overseen by an advisory board consisting of fifteen members. Both institutions are elected every second year. For administrative work the society maintains a secretary.


## Membership

Currently (2014), the society has about 1200 members including both individuals and institutions.
