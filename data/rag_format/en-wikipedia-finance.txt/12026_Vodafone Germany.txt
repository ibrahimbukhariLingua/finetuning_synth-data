## History

The company in its present form resulted from Vodafone's takeover of the German engineering group Mannesmann GmbH in 2000. On 8 December 1989, the West German Federal Ministry for Posts and Telecommunications (Bundesministerium für Post und Telekommunikationᵈᵉ; one of several predecessors of the present-day Bundesnetzagentur) awarded the second digital GSM-900 (also known as D-Netz (D-Netzᵈᵉ; *D-Network* in Germany) network in Germany to Mannesmann, as the first private company in Germany to break the monopoly of the telecommunications services operated by Deutsche Bundespost (now Deutsche Telekom). This licence was subsequently expanded to cover the former East Germany after German reunification in 1991. Mannesmann subsequently began operations of its mobile network on 30 June 1992. It was rebranded **Vodafone D2** in 2002.

In February 2011, Vodafone Germany started providing IPTV via DSL and VDSL connections. In April 2011, Vodafone Germany started to distribute Disney content via IPTV.

Following Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone Germany started selling the Apple iPhone 4S in September 2011.

As of 2014, the company owns around 75% of Kabel Deutschland and in 2019 Unitymedia was merged with Vodafone.

In February 2020, the Unitymedia brand was phased out from market, by Vodafone Germany.
