## History

Cambridge Consultants was founded in 1960 by Tim Eiloart, Rodney Dale, and David Southward, three Cambridge University graduates.

Initially, the company was privately run. In 1971, it became part of Arthur D. Little (ADL), an American management consultancy firm. In 2002, following ADL's Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Cambridge Consultants was acquired by Altran, a global innovation and engineering consulting firm. In 2020, Altran itself was acquired by Capgemini, with Cambridge Consultants thus coming under the ownership of the French firm, and operating under the "Capgemini Invent" umbrella.


## Notable spin-outs

Cambridge Consultants has been described as one of the founders of the Cambridge Cluster and has spun out multiple $1bn+ companies, including:

* Alphamosaic
* Domino Printing Sciences
* Cambridge Silicon Radio
* Xaar
