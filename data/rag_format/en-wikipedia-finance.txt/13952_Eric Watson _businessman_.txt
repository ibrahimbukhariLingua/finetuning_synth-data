### Hanover

Watson and business partner Mark Hotchin bought Elders Finance in 1999. Elders, and a number of other finance companies, were brought together to create Hanover Group. In July 2008 the finance companies within Hanover Group froze repayments, suspending acceptance of new deposits.

Hanover paid dividends of NZ$41 million in the 2007 financial year and NZ$45.5 million in the 2008 financial year. The following financial year, NZ$68.5m was contributed to Hanover by entities associated with Watson and Hotchin.

In December 2009 Hanover Group debenture holders, note holders and bond holders voted in favour of swapping their debentures, notes and bonds for shares in Allied Farmers Limited (NZX: ALF). This transaction resulted in ALF assuming the net asset position of the Hanover Group finance companies.

When Hanover collapsed, causing significant losses for many small investors, concerns were raised about Hanover group's true financial position, its solvency when paying dividends, transactions that may have benefited related parties, and the accuracy of asset valuations.

Through the firm, he bought a 75% stake in the New Zealand Warriors in 2000, which competes in the Australasian National Rugby League (NRL) and is New Zealand's largest and highest-profile privately owned sporting franchise. He later reduced his share to 50% while selling off the other half to New Zealand billionaire Owen Glenn. However, in 2015, he increased his share to 100% becoming the sole-owner of the 'Vodafone Warriors' franchise.

The Watson Foundation is a charitable trust established by Cullen Investments to enrich the lives of underprivileged children and young people and assist with their needs, including care, support, protection, health and education. The foundation sponsored till about 2011 charities such as The First Tee of New Zealand.

Cullen Investments and many associated NZ companies were placed into liquidation in late 2019 early 2020.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2021 charged Eric Watson and two others with insider trading in relation to Long Island Iced Tea Corp's announcement in December 2017 that it would change its name to Long Blockchain Corp. This change also reflected a change in its focus to blockchain from iced tea and lemonade. As a result its shares soared by nearly 400%.
