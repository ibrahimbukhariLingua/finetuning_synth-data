## Milestones and incidents


### Financing

CircleCI raised $50k from a small investor a few months after starting, $1.5m in seed funding in 2013, a $6m Series A round from DFJ in 2014, a $18M Series B financing round from Scale Venture Partners in 2016, a $31M Series C led by Top Tier Capital Partners in 2018, a $56M Series D led by Owl Rock Capital and NextEquity Partners in 2019, a $100M Series E round led by IVP in 2020, and a $100M Series F round led by Greenspring Associates in 2021. In total this is $315 million in funding.


### Acquisitions

CircleCI acquired Distiller in 2014, Vamp in 2021, and Ponicode in 2022.


### Data breaches

In 2013, CircleCI suffered a major data breach due to its provider MongoHQ, but was able to quickly respond and replace its security keys, resulting in almost no lost customers.

In August 2019, there was a data breach in a third-party analytics vendor account used by CircleCI.

In January 2023, CircleCI announced a recent system breach and advised customers to rotate "any and all secrets" stored in CircleCI.


## Product

CircleCI monitors GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and Atlassian Bitbucket repositories and launches builds for each new commit. CircleCI automatically tests builds in either Docker containers or virtual machines and deploys passing builds to target environments. A dashboard and API allow tracking the status of builds and metrics related to builds. A Slack integration notifies teams if issues arise.

SSH support allows locally running jobs, and security measures prevent tampering. CircleCI also offers a workflow approval feature that pauses the job(s) until manual approval is given.

CircleCI supports Go, Java, Ruby, Python, Scala, Node.js, PHP, Haskell, and any other language that runs on Linux or macOS.

The company offers a managed cloud service with a free tier available. The platform can also be self-hosted on a private server (behind a corporate firewall), or as a private deployment in the cloud. The cloud service was initially written from scratch but now uses HashiCorp's Nomad and Kubernetes.

The cloud service can be set up within minutes, but is less customizable than Jenkins.


### Orbs

Orbs are shareable snippets of YAML that can be used to simplify CircleCI builds and perform deployments. CircleCI had integrations with 45 partners as of 2019. CircleCI's target deployment environments include Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Azure, Google Compute Engine, Docker images, and virtual Linux, Android, Windows, or macOS machines with VMware. In 2018 CircleCI's `config.yml` was the fastest growing YAML file on GitHub.

The proprietary configuration syntax introduces vendor lock-in, meaning that switching CI services requires rewriting the pipeline.
