## Description

The document was written by Diogenes, the contractor for the sales tax that year, and addressed to the public bank of Oxyrhynchus. It authorizes the bank to receive 52 drachmae as tax on the purchase of a slave, which was probably 10% of the purchase price. The slave, named Plution, was purchased by a woman named Chaeremonis. The measurements of the fragment are 255 by 80 mm.

It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1898. The fragment was also examined by Eck and Heinrichs (Eck & Heinrichs, *Sklaven und Freigelassene* (1993), p. 40, Nr. 53).
