# Goizueta Business School



**Emory University's Goizueta Business School** (also known as *Goizueta Business School*, *Emory Business School*, or simply *Goizueta* – pronounced *goy-swet-ah*) is a private business school of Emory University located in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is named after Roberto C. Goizueta, former Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.

The school is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Goizueta has over 23,000 alumni worldwide in 104 countries.


## History

On February 18, 1919, the dean of Emory College, Howard Odum, recommended the creation of a "school of economics and business administration" to the Board of Trustees. Thus, in the fall of 1919, the new school worked with Emory College to offer courses in economics, accounting, and business law. By 1925, there was one faculty member and full-time assistant, five staff members and 145 students. In 1926, eight students received the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Two decades after the school awarded degrees in business administration, the school accepted its first female student in 1954. In the same year, the MBA program commenced, with 19 registered students.

In 1992, the Evening MBA program was introduced. When the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business began accrediting master’s programs, Emory’s program was one of the first to be approved. This newfound position accompanied new programs, such as the concentration within the MBA program for professional accounting and, in 1979, the Executive MBA program. Also at this time, the school created a plan to allow students to complete both the MBA and Juris Doctor degree within four years.

In 1994, the school was renamed for Roberto C. Goizueta, the CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. The millennium brought about a new PhD program in business administration and a new program in Real Estate. The school announced Karen Sedatole as interim dean in 2020.
