Atomic Energy Act 1989


# Atomic Energy Act 1989



The **Atomic Energy Act 1989** (1989 chapter 7) is an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom. The act amended the financial limits of British Nuclear Fuels plc; the expenses of the Health and Safety Executive; the compensation available from public funds; and the provisions for mutual assistance in the event of a nuclear accident or emergency.


## Rationale

The act raised the financial limit of British Nuclear Fuels plc from £1.5 billion to £2 billion. This allowed BNF plc to progress its investment in the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP). This facility had over £4 billion of advance contracts in 1989. An investment of £500 million was required to reduce radioactive discharges to virtually zero.

The act enabled the Health and Safety Executive to recover the costs associated with issuing nuclear licenses. The act amended legislation and allowed the UK to ratify the convention on assistance in the case of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency.


## Provisions

Long title: An Act to alter the financial limit imposed by section 2(1) of the Nuclear Industry (Finance) Act 1977 in relation to British Nuclear Fuels plc; to make provision with respect to the recovery of certain expenses by the Health and Safety Executive; to amend sections 18 and 19 of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965; to make provision in connection with the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency; and for connected purposes.##2
