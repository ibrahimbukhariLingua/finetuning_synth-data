# Indofood



**Indofood** is an Indonesian producer of various foods and drinks, headquartered in Jakarta. The company was established on 14 August 1990 as **PT Panganjaya Intikusuma**, then later on 5 February 1994 its name was changed to Indofood Sukses Maksur.

## History

Indofood was founded in 1969 as Lambang Insan Makmur, an instant noodles businessᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ, with its brand Indomie launching in 1972. The company restructured on August 14, 1990, as PT Panganjaya Intikusuma. In 1994, the company was renamed to PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, and it was listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange on July 14, 1994. It is one of the companies owned by the family of Sudono Salim under the Salim Group.

In January 2013, as part of a filing for the Indonesia Stock Exchange, Indofood said it was planning to buy 50% of Brazilian sugar-cane processor *Companhia Mineira de Açúcar e Álcool Participações*, (CMAA) for $72 million.

In January 2015, Indofood built an instant noodles factory in Morocco, which was to be opened in the third quarter of 2015. It was to be the sixth plant in Africa after Nigeria, Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia, and the biggest overseas Indomie factory.

In January 2019, Indofood withdrew from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification scheme.

On February 17, 2021, Indofood CBP purchased all of the shares owned by Fritolay Netherlands Holding B.V., an affiliate of PepsiCo at PT Indofood Fritolay Makmur (IFL) worth IDR 494 billion, so that the production of Lay's, Cheetos and Doritos brand snacks in Indonesia would be stopped on August 18, 2021. IFL was then renamed to PT Indofood Fortuna Makmur. In addition, PepsiCo and its affiliates agreed not to produce, package, sell, market or distribute snack products that compete with IFL products in Indonesia for a period of three years. Lay's, Cheetos and Doritos in the Indonesian market were rebranded into Chitato Lite, Chiki Twist and Maxicorn, respectively.
