## Payment systems

The Banking and Payment Authorities of Kosovo (BPK) planned to establish an Interbank Payment System since November 2000. This idea was initially supported by the International Monetary Fond (IMF) through their professional payment consultants. The recommendations given were based on three development phases, which helped in creating the existing work plan. With the establishment of the Interbank Payments Advisory Committee (IPAC) under the patronage of the Central Bank of Kosovo with the participation of all the other commerce banks, the work continued on framing all the other operational policies on this subject.

Interbank Payment System has gone through three main phases.


### First phase

Interbank Clearing System started to function on May 7, 2001. This phase was characterized with the manual exchange of payments, with settlements based on NET balance between debit and credit. In this way, the receiving bank account was credited and the debiting account was debited. At the start, since the number of payment was low, the registrations in account were done manually or on individual bases. This was reached with an agreement between the Interbank Clearing System (ICS) and other participating banks.
Another interesting fact regarding the first phase was the activity of the Interbank Payments Advisory Committee (IPAC). This committee was first composed of several banks like ProCredit Bank, NLB Prishtina, Bank for Business. Moreover, Economic Bank joined in June and, towards the end of 2001, Raiffeissen Bank, BKP, and KSB joined also. The committee's obligation was to set the operating rules, the procedure, and standards for Interbank Clearing System. After a year, this committee worked toward Electronic Interbank Clearing System (EICS) which would make possible electronic exchange.


### Second phase

The change into manual and semi-manual exchange led to other developments and transformations of the Electronic Interbank Clearing System (EICS). In 2002, the full transition to the electronic system was done. This was achieved in adherence to the necessary IT system and the consultations with KPMG-USAID.
The second phase was also categorized with another success, which was the transition to the Standard Numbering System of the Kosovo Banking Accounts. With the assistance of other member banks, this standard reached to be applied to all bank payment accounts that resulted into the increment of the efficiency of the payment system, and more possibilities for new reforms.
Another important event was the one on 7 September 2004 when the chief of the American office also the director of USAID acknowledged the Central Bank of Kosovo as the owner of the Electronic Interbank Clearing System present in Kosovo.


### Third phase

With the establishment of the EICS system in 2007, the payments delivery system between central and local institutions was highly improved. This eventually progressed into an interconnected framework of all banks in Kosovo. Direct Debit, as the center's newest instrument of payments was first introduced in January 2009, after the approval of the Central Bank's Rule nr XXXI. The release for the general public has been made possible only in November, after the debit system was tested as a separate component in the Electronic Interbank Clearing System (EICS). The system was widely recognized by many banks, including ProCredit Bank, Raiffeissen Bank, NLB Prishtina, Bank for Business, Economic Bank, TEB and National Commercial Bank. The system's efficiency has been increased, which indirectly added to the standards and capacity of the interbank system.
"Now every day the participants of the interbank payment system send more safely and efficiently about 15 thousand payments worth over 15 million Euros."


### Development strategy

In 2009, the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo initiated many discussions on creating a long-term strategy. The discussions were finalized and approved by the Governing Board of the Central Bank on September 11, 2009, which in collaboration with the commercial banks and World Bank has created an Interbank Payment Systems Directorate (IPSD) within its body, which has the aim to ensure that the development strategies for the financial sector in Kosovo will be met.

The 9 pillars in this development strategy for the National Payments System (NPS) are:

1. Legal Framework
2. Large-value and time-critical payments
3. Retail payment systems
4. Government transactions
5. Securities depository, clearance and settlement
6. Money market
7. International remittances
8. Oversight
9. Cooperation (National Payments Council)

Real time gross settlement system (RTGS) remains the most important singular project which is being developed under the NPS.


## Strategic plan (2010–2015)

The Central Bank has set five strategic goals for five years of its operations, with the purpose of aligning the Bank's duties towards the citizens and the economy in general. These goals are:

1. To promote and foster financial stability in the Republic of Kosovo - The Central bank analyses the safety of the financial system, eliminates the potential risks and by creating analytical indicators, and also promotes a proper environment for operations
2. To support general economic policies to achieve sustainable economic growth in the Republic of Kosovo - The Central Bank encourages economic growth through better economic policy making, by conducting economic research and informing the public.
3. To ensure development of contemporary interbank systems and to provide effective banking services to customers - By using the Electronic Interbank Clearing System (EICS), the Central Bank functions as a hybrid system that facilitates the channeling of various payment instruments among banks.
4. To promote sound development of the financial sector in the Republic of Kosovo - The Central Bank of Kosovo aims to develop the financial sector by investing on the safeguard of the private market enterprises and on providing the government with their own experience. CBD tends to achieve this by framing a new legal framework for new financial products and accrediting new financial institutions.
5. To contribute to the processes for integration into European Union and other international institutions - This strategy includes investing on promoting the Republic of Kosovo and the Central Bank of Kosovo at an international level. This to be achieved by maintaining good relations with other counter-parties, applying international standards and attending seminars and event organized.

## Issuance of bonds

After signing a regulation for primary and secondary government bonds with the Ministry of Finance in December 2011, the Central Bank of Kosovo issued bonds for the first time on January 17, 2012. During its first auction, the CBK was able to collect a sum of €10 million worth of monetary assets. Another €64 million could be raised during the rest of 2012, bringing the total value of bonds issued during 2012 to €74 million, just as was declared by an adviser to the Minister of Finance on January 9, 2012. It is expected that during the course of 2013, the CBK will be able to raise a sum equal to €80 million.

## Controversies

On 23 July 2010, Hashim Rexhepi, then the governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo, was arrested based on grounds of "corruption and money laundering".
According to EU's Rule of Law Mission EULEX, "the probe concerned suspected bribes, tax evasion, influence-peddling and money laundering". The arrest produced a lot of media attention since television pictures showed Rexhepi being led out of his office by "heavily armed" police officers. After being arrested, Rexhepi had to stay for four months in pre-trial imprisonment. The arrest and investigation was committed by EULEX. The indictment followed more than one year after the arrest; when that happened, the EULEX prosecutors dropped all of the most serious charges. Ultimately, on 11 January 2012, the decision became final and Hashim Rexhepi was found innocent. The accusations and imprisonment, however, cost Hashim Rexhepi to lose his job as governor of Kosovo's central bank.
