In 1986, the asset management and investment bank areas were created. In 1989, the bank opened its São Paulo's office and started the internationalization of operations. Eleven years after the foundation, the bank started the wealth management activities.

In 2006, the UBS bought Banco Pactual for US$2.5 billion and created UBS Pactual, André Esteves became CEO of all UBS' Latin American operations. Two years later, Esteves left the bank to found BTG Investments with nine other founding partners of UBS and UBS Pactual, including Pérsio Arida, a former president of the Brazilian Central Bank.

## Controversies


### Insider trading

This case was closed and there was no impact to the public offering. In 2012, penalties for André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option to reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest-profile bank deals." In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision." However, Esteves did not appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.


### Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG

Arthur Rutishauser argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3 billion SFr to UBS, where Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker. Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion SFr after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG. Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared then resurfaced as a senior partner and board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.


### BTG Pactual purchase of BSI

In July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with this being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The CEO of FINMA, Mark Branson, was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd. and reported directly to Huw Jenkins, CEO of UBS Investment Bank who is now a partner of BTG Pactual. Under Mark Branson, FINMA decided whether to approve BTG Pactual's purchase of BSI, although BTG Pactual was owned and operated by former superiors and colleagues Jenkins and Esteves, it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.


### Misrepresentation allegation

The case was closed, a final settlement has been reached. An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BTG Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim alleging Banco BTG Pactual board member Huw Jenkins made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with the bank. Ivic said he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual's initial public offering (IPO) for which Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares. Ivic, who valued his claim at some US$20 million, started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013. In March 2017, the parties involved reached a final settlement.
