## History

Heward Stikeman and Fraser Elliott established a tax boutique firm in Montreal in 1952. The firm expanded throughout the ensuing years, eventually becoming a full-service business law firm. Stikeman Elliott has never merged with another firm, one of the few Bay Street firms not to do so.

One of the first national firms to maintain an office in Quebec, along with McCarthy TÃ©trault, Stikeman Elliott is widely considered one of the best firms in Quebec. The firm is one of the Seven Sisters, a group of seven prominent Canadian law firms.
