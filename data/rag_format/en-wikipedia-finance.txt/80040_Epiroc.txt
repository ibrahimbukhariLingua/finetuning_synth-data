## History

Epiroc has its roots in Atlas Copco, which was founded in 1873 in Stockholm. It was created as a result of Atlas Copco's decision to split out its legacy business of mining equipment.

In January 2017, Atlas Copco's board of directors decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting that the company be divided, and that the mining and infrastructure business be listed as its own separate company in 2018. Epiroc was officially created on 1 January 2018 and was subsequently listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange on June 18, 2018.
