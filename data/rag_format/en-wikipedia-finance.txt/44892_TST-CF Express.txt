## Company

TFI International is a Canadian transport and logistics company based in Montreal, Quebec. It operates across Canada through 4 business segments. Its trucking fleet consists of 6700 power units and 12000 trailers. Two thirds of its business comes from operations in Eastern Canada while the rest is from Western Canada.

The company's main source of growth has been complete takeovers (it holds no stakes in other companies) of smaller trucking companies (35 since 1992) which are then made into subsidiaries, though more recently organic growth contributed to the 53% rise in freight in the first half of 2010. In December 2010 Transforce will enter the US market when it agreed in principle to purchase Dallas based Dynamex with a $248 million takeover offer. In the 12 months leading up to October 31, 2010 Dynamex made $418 million in revenue (about a quarter as much as Transforce).

The company has 1,685 Power and Trailing equipment and covers 10 Canadian Provinces and 50 U.S. States
