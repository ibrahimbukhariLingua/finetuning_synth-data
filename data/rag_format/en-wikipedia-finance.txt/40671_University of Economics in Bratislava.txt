# University of Economics in Bratislava



The **University of Economics in Bratislava** (Slovak: *Ekonomická univerzita v Bratislave*) is the oldest university of economics in Slovakia.


## History

The university was established in 1940 as a private university under the name **Vysoká obchodná škola v Bratislave** (College of Commerce in Bratislava), to serve Slovak students because of the closure of colleges and universities in the German-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It was nationalized in 1945 and renamed to *Slovenská vysoká škola obchodná* (Slovak College of Commerce). It was renamed in 1949 to *Vysoká škola hospodárskych vied* (College of Business / Economic Sciences) and once again in 1952 to *Vysoká škola ekonomická* (College of Economics). The current name has been used since 1992.
