# Swedish Business Awards



**The Swedish Business Awards** were established in 2006. The project aims to provide positive examples for international establishments and business development by highlighting the success of cooperation, emphasizing innovativeness, outstanding business achievements and the importance of contributions to society. This initiative promotes internationalization of business and serves as a yearly meeting point to discuss achievements, practices and aims.

The Swedish Business Awards are prestigious event - selected participants are invited, combining representatives from Swedish companies, top executives and opinion leaders on National business stage and top politicians. In addition to this, in 2014 in Estonia awards were handed by Crown Princess of Sweden Victoria, while in 2015 in Lithuania by HM King Carl XVI Gustaf.


## Sustainable event

In 2015, celebrating 10th anniversary, Swedish Business Awards became the first sustainable event in Lithuania, organized in accordance with the requirements of ISO 20121:2012 standards.
