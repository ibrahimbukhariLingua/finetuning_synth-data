## History

In May 2017, the MCCA said they would be issuing a request for proposal to hire a firm to analyze development options on the 30 acres of land surrounding the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.
In February 2018, the MCCA tapped design and consultancy firm Arcadis to oversee capital improvements across four MCCA facilities. <Boston Business Journal
