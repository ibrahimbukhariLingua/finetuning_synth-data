## Sanctions for illegal practices with Sendwave app

In 2023 the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that Chime Inc, a WorldRemit subsidiary which operates Sendwave, had violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the CFPB Remittance Transfer Rule. Some of the specific violations were:

* The Sendwave user agreement illegally waived consumer's legal protections regarding liability for losses incurred using the app.
* The speed and cost of transfers were misrepresented. The company promised transfers would happen in seconds, but often took much longer. Transfers to Nigeria were not free as promised.
* Sendwave failed to disclose correct exchange rates or funds availability.
* Sendwave did not have policies and procedures to track and investigate remittance transfer errors, it did not properly investigate errors when it was notified.
* Sendwave sometimes did not provide receipts within the time frame required by the Remittance Transfer Rule.

In its consent decree Chime was ordered to pay $1.5 million in refunds, fined $1.5 million, and it agreed to change its practices.


## Funding

WorldRemit is backed by venture capital companies Accel Partners and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV).

In February 2015, the firm announced a $100m Series B funding round led by TCV. It was also announced that TCV General Partner John Rosenberg would join its board.

In 2017, the firm received $40 million in their Series C round of funding, with LeapFrog Investments as the lead investor. In 2019, it raised a $175 million Series D funding round, led by TCV, Accel, and Leapfrog Investments.
