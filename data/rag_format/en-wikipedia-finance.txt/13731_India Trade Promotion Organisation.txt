**ITPO has four Regional Offices:**

The Regional Offices, through their respective profile of activities, ensure a concerted and well coordinated trade promotion drive throughout the country.


## Subsidiaries

ITPO has two subsidiaries namely **Tamil Nadu Trade Promotion Organisation (TNTPO)** and **Karnataka Trade Promotion Organisation (KTPO)** with share holding of 51 percent in each of them. With the commissioning of the state-of-the-art Chennai Trade Centre (CTC) in January 2001 and the Trade Centre Bangalore in September 2004, ITPO has successfully completed the first phase of the setting-up of modern exhibition facilities outside Delhi.

In FY 2015–2016, TNTPO and KTPO registered revenues of about ₹315 million and ₹48 million respectively and have reserves of about ₹1840 million and ₹390 million respectively.

The Chennai Trade Centre, which is now spread across 14,000 sqm, is planned to be expanded by addition of 6,000 sqm and ITPO is seeking approval from the board of the TNTPO for the same.

In 1995, ITPO launched 50:50 Joint subsidiary with National Informatics Centre (NIC) in the form of **National Centre for Trade Information (NCTI)**, for collection and dissemination of trade data and improving Business Information Services to the business community, especially SME. In 2015–2016, NCTI registered operational loss of about ₹2 million and net negative assets of about ₹4 million.

ITPO had coordinated the construction of exhibition-cum-trade complex **Maniram Dewan Trade Centre (Guwahati)** for Assam Trade Promotion Organisation under 'Assistance to States for Developing Export Infrastructure and Allied Activities (ASIDE) Scheme, for facilitating trade in North-Eastern States.

**International Trade and Convention Centre (Kerala)** is proposed joint venture project of Indian Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) and Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra) at 25 acres of land in the Kinfra Export Promotion Industrial Park in Kakkanad. The project would require investment of ₹1125 million, of which ₹31.25 crore each will be provided by the central and state governments and the remaining ₹50 crore will be mobilised via credit. The state government granted an in-principle approval for the project in 2012, but owing to the non-availability of funds it got delayed.


## Strategic Issues

ITPO is operating a trade portal **Trade Portal of India** having all trade related information including country profiles, product profiles, trade directory etc. ITPO is networking with International Organisation in the field of Trade and Commerce through membership or collaborative arrangements such as Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), ITPO is a founder member of Asian Trade Promotion Forum (ATPF) and participates in its Annual meets regularly.

Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) provide round-the-clock security at Pragati Maidan. Access control to the exhibitions area would also be monitored by another team of the squad with help from private security guards.

ITPO signed MoU with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) to collaborate on trade promotion. ITPO also signed MoU with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in April 2011, directed towards a collective and well-directed effort to promote India's trade identifying the internal strengths of the respective organisations.

ITPO signed MoU with National Book Trust (NBT), India for conducting New Delhi World Book Fair every year, starting from February 2013.

In 2013, ITPO has commissioned the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) to construct a **Business Confidence Index** and a **Consumer Confidence Index** using data from ITPO's exhibitions.

Karnataka Exhibition Authority (KEA) is in early discussions with ITPO to set up **Pragati Haat** in every district headquarters and one near Bangalore similar to that of Delhi's Pragati Maidan. KEA has sought 20 acres of land in each district and 70 acres of land near Bangalore for the purpose.

As per Allocation of Business Rules (which describes distribution of subject amongst GoI's departments and ministries), ITPO's activities are now classified under Export Promotion, in place of the previous classification under State Trading.

Commerce & Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman endorsed in September 2015 that ITPO is one of India's best agencies for international affairs and is on the verge of starting a major Convention Centre in Delhi as the capital does not have a venue where international conferences could be held.


## Financials

ITPO was upgraded to **Mini-Ratna Category-1** by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) in 2015 due to continuous profit and robust past performance, empowering ITPO to incur capital expenditure on new projects, modernisation, purchase of equipment etc., without Government approval up to ₹500 crores. ITPO is registered under Section-8 of the Companies Act, 2013 and so does not declare any dividend.

ITPO's cash surplus stands at more than ₹316 crores in FY2021-22. ITPO continues performing handsomely and its networth has surpassed ₹2000 crores in FY2020-21.


## Logo

ITPO logo was designed for the erstwhile TFAI by eminent graphic designer **Benoy Sarkar** in 1974. He is also credited for designing iconic logos of Indian Airlines, Airports Authority of India, Delhi Transport Corporation, etc.

ITPO logo has an interesting depiction of letters T (Trade) and F (Fair). The tone is a fusion of preservation of traditions of Trade and Investments along with modern identity of ITPO. The logo has a universal form. It signifies an authority of India exercising trade through fairs and exhibitions in India and abroad. The emblem has been derived from an inscription on a gold coin belonging to the era of the ancient ruler, Samundragupta (circa 330-380 A.D.) symbolising the zenith achieved in external trade. The vertical and horizontal strokes in the symbol represent life and prosperity.
