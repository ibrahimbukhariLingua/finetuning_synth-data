# Fiume krone



The **Fiume krone** (Croatian: *Riječka kruna*, Italian: *Corona Fiumana*, abbreviated **Cor.** or **FIUK**) was a currency used in the Free State of Fiume. It was introduced on 18 April 1919 by the National Council of Fiume who effectively exercised power in the City through stamping of the previous Austro-Hungarian krone notes.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ After the occupation by Gabriele D'Annunzio in September 1919, a new series of notes were stamped on behalf of the *Istituto di credito del Consiglio Nazionale* with a decree dated 6 October 1919. The Fiume krone was the official currency of the city of Fiume until 26 September 1920 when, by the decree of General Amantea who was commanding the Italian troops in Fiume, the Italian lira was introduced as the new official currency.

The currency continued to circulate until the annexation of the city to Italy in February 1924. The royal decree n 235 of 24 February 1924 set the final conversion date on 30 April 1924, at 0.40 Italian lira for one Fiume krone.
