# Neil Auerbach



**Neil Z. Auerbach** (born December 3, 1958) is a private equity investor and a pioneer in the sustainable investment sector. Over the course of his 20+ years in the sustainability sector, Auerbach has led over 30 investments in 26 countries and is known for his early leadership in the financial services industry’s transition to clean energy investment. Auerbach is the CEO & Chairman of Hudson Sustainable Group, based in Miami, Florida.


## Goldman Sachs

After working in the Debt Capital Markets and Credit Derivatives units at Goldman Sachs, Auerbach joined Goldman's Special Situations Group in December 2003. He began to focus on the renewable energy industry in the U.S. and went on to launch the alternative energy investment business within the Special Situations Group with a principal focus on wind and solar energy. During Auerbach's tenure in the Group, he invested over $1.5 billion of firm capital in wind energy, solar energy, and biofuel companies and established a track record of developing, closing, and funding unique structured financings. Auerbach led several of Goldman's most successful renewable energy investments, including Horizon Wind Energy, SunEdison, and First Solar.


## Hudson Clean Energy Partners

In 2007, Auerbach was joined by two other Goldman colleagues to found Hudson Clean Energy Partners (“HCEP”), an independent private equity firm. Auerbach served as Co-Managing Partner with John Cavalier, who joined Hudson in 2008 from Credit Suisse's Global Energy Group, where he was chairman.

HCEP raised over $1 billion in assets and invested in sectors including wind, solar, and hydroelectric energy, biomass, smart grid, energy efficiency, and storage. HCEP wound down its operations gradually beginning in 2014. John Cavalier departed in 2017.


## Hudson Sustainable Group (HSG)

In 2014 Hudson reorganized as Hudson Sustainable Group (“HSG”). Auerbach currently serves as CEO and Chairman. HSG continued to raise infrastructure and private equity funds but also expanded into starting and building companies in the clean energy sector. Its initial foray into company building started with Sunlight Financial.


### Sunlight Financial

In 2014, Neil Auerbach founded Sunlight Financial LLC (“Sunlight”) along with other HSG colleagues. Sunlight quickly grew to become one of the largest solar financiers in the United States, arranging over $10 billion in loans to homeowners since inception. Auerbach was the first CEO and transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman and then Chairman with the hiring of Matt Potere as CEO in September 2015.

On July 12, 2021, Sunlight went public on the NY Stock Exchange in a de-SPAC transaction led by Apollo Management. The company was initially valued at $1.3 billion at the time of its public listing. Upon the public listing Auerbach and Wilson Chang resigned their board roles in favor of independent directors. In 2022, Sunlight reported growth in funded loans of 15%, average solar loan balance growth of 13%, and borrowers served of 12%. Despite this growth Sunlight reported a 16% decrease in revenue and a GAAP net loss of $511.9M (down from $241.0M in the prior year), primarily due to a $445.8M non-cash impairment of goodwill driven by an increase in interest rates. In the 3 months ended in June 2023 Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc. reported a net loss of $54.66M, a steep fall from a profit of $4.12M reported in the prior year. Sunlight continued to struggle financially throughout the rest of 2023.

On October 30, 2023, Sunlight and its affiliates each filed voluntary petitions for chapter 11 U.S. Bankruptcy in Delaware.


#### Sunlight Financial Investor Lawsuit

On October 3, 2023, Neil and Hudson Sustainable Group filed a lawsuit against certain officers and directors of Sunlight Financial, seeking over $60m in damages, alleging that Sunlight failed to disclose material information in 2022 and 2023 vital to understanding the precarious financial condition of the company.


### Sustainable BioSolutions

In 2018, Hudson acquired Sustainable BioSolutions, a distressed biogas developer in Denmark, which was attempting to develop the largest biogas plant in the world. HSG partnered with a European real estate development firm to acquire the company, and jointly led all aspects of the investment and redevelopment. SBS was acquired by Arjun Infrastructure Partners in 2020.


### Hudson Japan

In 2018, Auerbach and partner Jonathan Lee expanded HSG’s business into the Japanese renewable energy market with the establishment of Hudson Sustainable Japan. During this time, Hudson acquired and developed 33 solar PV facilities distributed through Japan. In 2022, Hudson expanded its team in Japan to focus on opportunities in the corporate PPA renewable power market.


### Tandem Infrastructure

In 2022, Hudson provided seed financing and ongoing support to Tandem Infrastructure (website) to accelerate its mission of building the most robust nationwide sales channel in the commercial and industrial solar industry. Tandem’s unique business model offers an entirely new stream of income to property owners in the form of roof leases.


### Latin American Real Assets (LARA) Opportunity Fund

In 2023, Hudson Sustainable Group joined Mauricio Claver-Carone and Jessica Bedoya in launching the Latin America Real Assets Opportunities (LARA) Fund. LARA is primarily focused on transitional energy and sustainable infrastructure investments across 12 attractive countries in LATAM and the Caribbean. HSG’s involvement in LARA marks a return to the fund management business for HSG and may signal other similar initiatives in the future.


## Policy Initiatives

As a former Commissioner of the National Commission on Energy Policy (Bipartisan Policy Center), Auerbach has advocated bipartisan support for U.S. clean energy legislation, developed in-depth policy recommendations, and participated in a commission consisting of a private, bipartisan, and diverse group of leading energy experts and stakeholders.

Auerbach was also an early supporter of the tax equity market as a significant driver of the expansion of U.S. renewable energy. He has stated that it has had a positive impact in the areas of utility‐scale wind power generation and commercial‐scale solar facilities.

In 2011, Auerbach testified in front of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Sub-Committee on Energy and Power, and the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, proposing a market-based approach for the federal government to encourage large-scale deployment of clean energy in the U.S. Auerbach has supported the development and implementation of reverse auctions as an innovative approach to support the continued growth of the renewable energy sector that has met success in other industries and recently in the renewable energy industry in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Honduras, Uruguay, China, Morocco, and Egypt.

Auerbach has continued to advocate for sustainability focused policies in the U.S., including most recently – in 2023 – with former US National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien. In the Fox News Op-Ed, titled “It's time for an 'America First' climate agenda. Here are 3 ways Republicans can win in 2024,” Auerbach and O’Brien called for a three-pronged policy agenda focusing on promoting advanced low-carbon energy, domestic mining and manufacturing, and clean U.S. fossil fuel extraction.
