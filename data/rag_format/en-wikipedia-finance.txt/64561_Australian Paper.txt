Australian Paper


# Australian Paper



**Australian Paper** is an Australian manufacturer of office, printing and packaging papers. The company manufactures more than 600,000 tonnes of paper annually for Australia, New Zealand and other export markets. Australian Paper was purchased from Paperlinx by Nippon Paper Industries in June 2009.


## Facilities

Australian Paper has two manufacturing facilities: the Maryvale Mill in the Latrobe Valley and a manufacturing facility in Preston. In February 2015 Australian Paper announced the closure of the Shoalhaven Paper Mill in Bomaderry, New South Wales. The mill closed in July 2015. In April 2015, Australian Paper opened a new A$90 million paper recycling plant at the Maryvale Mill. The plant can process up to 80,000 tonnes of wastepaper a year.


## Environmental impact

Australian Paper has a contract with the Victorian Government for the period 1996â€“2030 of buying wood at a 1996 fixed price on the logs. This includes mountain ash timber, deemed by scientists to be of high conservation value. In August 2011, Australian Paper withdrew from Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, in order to be able to use wood from old-growth forest logging by VicForests, but remained under the certification of the Australian Forestry Standard. Their previous auditor, SmartWood, was suspended in September 2011 following an FSC internal audit. Later, the company announced that its FSC certification had been retained for all products except Reflex paper. As of 2013, the Reflex 100% recycled paper is FSC-certified.
