## History

In 1943, BNCI, an ancestor of BNP Paribas, took over Crédit Foncier de Madagascar et de la Réunion, which it renamed BNCI Océan Indien in 1954. BNCI Océan Indien opened a branch in Djibouti the same year. In 1977, when Djibouti achieved independence from France, BNP converted the branch into a subsidiary.

In July 2007, BNP Paribas sold BCIMR to the French banking group Banques Populaires.

In February 2009, BCIMR opened a branch in Hargeisa, becoming the first bank there since the dissolution of the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia in 1990.
