Ceylonese rixdollar


# Ceylonese rixdollar



The **rixdollar** was the currency of British Ceylon until 1828. It was subdivided into 48 *stivers*, each of 4 *duit*. Units called the *fanam* and *larin* were also used, worth 4 and 9½ stiver, respectively. The currency derived from the Dutch rijksdaalder and stuiver, although the rijksdaalder was worth 50 stuiver.

Initially containing over 25 grams fine silver worth 4 shillings and sixpence in the 17th century, the Ceylonese rixdollar was worth just one-third this amount by the 19th century. In 1825 it was replaced by sterling coin at a rate of 1 rixdollar = 11⁄2 shillings, less than the Indian rupee which was worth about 111⁄12 shillings.


## Coins

The Netherlands United East India Company (VOC) issued coins during the 18th century in denominations of 1⁄8 and 1 duit, 1⁄4, 1, 2 and 4+3⁄4 stuiver and 1 rixdollar.

After the British took over Ceylon, dump coins (crudely struck copper pieces) were introduced in 1801 in denominations of 1⁄48, 1⁄24 and 1⁄12 rixdollar. In 1802, milled, copper coins for 1⁄192, 1⁄96 and 1⁄48 rixdollar were added, although the dump coins continued to be produced until 1816. Silver coins were introduced in 1803 for 24, 48 and 96 stivers.

In 1815, copper 1⁄2, 1 and 2 stuiver coins were issued, equal in value to the 1⁄96, 1⁄48 and 1⁄24 rixdollar denominations. Silver rixdollar coins were issued in 1821.


## Banknotes

The Government of Ceylon issued notes denominated in rixdollars, including 5 rixdollar notes in 1809 and 2 rixdollars in 1826.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
