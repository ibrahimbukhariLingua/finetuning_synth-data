Oracle Applications


# Oracle Applications



**Oracle Applications** comprise the applications software or business software of the Oracle Corporation both in the cloud and on-premises. The term refers to the non-database and non-middleware parts. The suite of applications includes enterprise resource planning, enterprise performance management, supply chain & manufacturing, human capital management, and advertising and customer experience.

Oracle initially launched its application suite with financials software in the late 1980s. By 2009, the offering extended to supply chain management, human-resource management, warehouse-management, customer-relationship management, call-center services, product-lifecycle management, and many other areas. Both in-house expansion and the acquisition of other companies have vastly expanded Oracle's application software business.

In February 2007, Oracle released Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS/e-BS) Release 12 (R12) – a bundling of several Oracle Applications. The release date coincided with new releases of other Oracle-owned products: JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft.

Oracle also has a portfolio of enterprise applications for the cloud (SaaS) known as Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications. These cloud applications include Oracle Cloud ERP, Oracle Cloud EPM, Oracle Cloud HCM, Oracle Cloud SCM, and Oracle Advertising and CX.
