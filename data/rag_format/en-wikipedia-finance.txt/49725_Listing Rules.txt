Listing Rules


# Listing Rules



The **UK Listing Rules** (**UKLR**) are a set of regulations applicable to any company listed on a United Kingdom stock exchange, subject to the oversight of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The UK Listing Rules set out mandatory standards for any company wishing to list its shares or securities for sale to the public, including principles on executive pay and the requirement to comply or explain noncompliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the requirements of information in a prospectus before an initial public offering of shares, new share offers, rights issues, disclosure of price sensitive information, or takeover bids for companies.


## History

The London Stock Exchange has had a long tradition of self-regulation. Previous versions of the same kinds of rules were known as the rules on "Admission of Securities to Quotations" or "Admission of Securities to Listing".

By 2011, the former UK Listing Authority was part of the government-appointed Financial Services Authority. After the FSA's abolition in 2013, it became part of the newly formed Financial Conduct Authority, and since 2017 reference to the UKLA as a separate body has been phased out.

In July 2024, the Listing Rules were overhauled and simplified, the biggest change in over 30 years.
