## History

National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) is an Indian central securities depository under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Finance, Government of India based in Mumbai. The enactment of Depositories Act, December 1995 paved the way for establishment of NSDL. It was established in 1995 as the first electronic securities depository in India with national coverage. And started the work in 1996.

Although India had a vibrant capital market which was more than a century old, the paper-based settlement of trades caused substantial problems such as bad delivery and delayed transfer of title. The promulgation of the Depositories ordinance in 1995 paved the way for the establishment of **National Securities Depository Limited** (NSDL), the first depository in India. Now, NSDL is one of the largest Depositories in the World. It has established a state-of-the-art infrastructure that handles most of the securities held and settled in de-materialized form in the Indian securities markets.

Securities are held in depository accounts, which are similar to holding funds in bank accounts. Transfer of ownership of securities is done through simple account transfers. This method does away with all the risks and hassles normally associated with paperwork. Consequently, the cost of transacting in a depository environment is considerably lower as compared to transacting in physical certificates.

NSDL introduced the concept of 'Demat' to India. In less than 8 years of its existence, NSDL enabled India securities markets to implement T+2 settlement. Indian markets are now implementing T+1 settlement in a phased manner.
