# GlobalCapital



***GlobalCapital*** is a news and data service covering the global debt and equity capital markets and is one of the branded business units of Delinian’s NextGen portfolio.

The publication is targeted at bankers, issuers, lawyers, investors, regulators, trading platforms and other industry experts.


## History

***GlobalCapital***, previously known as *Euroweek,* started in 1987 by the financial publishing company Euromoney as a weekly printed newspaper covering capital markets. It was published each Friday.

It printed its last physical edition in March 2020 as the world went into lockdown to fight the COVID-19 pandemic but by that stage was already a daily online news and data service.

Nonetheless, it still produces a weekly online edition every Friday morning as well as a host of data sets, special reports and podcasts.

Regular features include 'Southpaw', 'The GC View' and its two podcasts: ‘The GlobalCapital Podcast’ each Friday and ‘Another Fine Mezz’, which covers securitisation every Monday.

*EuroWeek Asia* was the publication's dedicated news section on the Asian equity, bond, loans and structured finance markets. It ran until 2022. This section was initially written and edited in Hong Kong and news was updated online daily. It included a weekly column, *Taipan,* on Asian Pacific gossip and insider knowledge. This also is now incorporated into *GlobalCapital*, as part of *GlobalCapital's* Asia coverage.

The publication includes regular league tables ranking capital market institutions in their sectors with data from Dealogic.

The publication regularly publishes special supplements on specific parts of the capital markets or countries, as well as its flagship *‘Review of the Year/Outlook’* report every December. Supplements have included coverage of structured finance, covered bonds, the sovereign, supranational and agency bond market and many more.

The *‘Review of the Year/Outlook’*, published in December, surveys market participants to obtain their views on the last 12 months and the year ahead.

*GlobalCapital* hosts a number of awards ceremonies and other events covering the capital markets. It hosts various awards for the bond, securitization, loan and equity markets as well as two sets of awards for the derivatives industry. It also runs small, editorially focused events for specialist sections of the capital markets under the banner GC Live.


## Change of name

*EuroWeek* was rebranded as *GlobalCapital* when, in 2014, it merged with other publications from the Euromoney Institutional Investor Group: *Asiamoney,* *Total Securitization,* *SSA Markets* (itself started by *EuroWeek* in 2010) and *Derivatives Week* to form *GlobalCapital*. *The Cover*, a niche title about the covered bond market as part of the *EuroWeek* stable was also later folded into *GlobalCapital*.

*GlobalCapital* delivers two weekly columns to the following market sectors: the sovereign, supranational and agency (SSA) bond market; the FIG/bank bond market, including covered bonds; investment grade corporate bonds; syndicated loans; equity capital markets; emerging market bonds and loans; securitization; sustainable finance; and investment banking and Asia capital markets.


## Change of owner

Euromoney Institutional Investor, which also published other titles such as Euromoney Magazine and Metal Bulletin, which later formed part of its Fastmarkets division, accepted a £1.7bn takeover bid in July 2022 from private equity groups Astorg and Epiris.

The deal split the business in two. Fastmarkets became a stand-alone entity, owned, and controlled by Astorg, with the remaining Euromoney business, including *GlobalCapital,* operating under the majority ownership and control of Epiris.

In November 2022, Becketts Bidco Limited, a newly formed company indirectly owned by funds managed by Astorg and Epiris, completed its acquisition of Euromoney, and it was delisted from the London Stock Exchange.

In January 2023, Euromoney rebranded as Delinian, consisting of Euromoney's specialist brands serving the financial and professional services and asset management industries. There were no brand or name changes for any customer-facing products.
