## Legal regulation

The concept of “outsourcing” in Ukrainian law has no definition, so it can be regulated solely in the context of analogy to certain legal rules. At the same time, the legislative field defines economic interaction through the conclusion of contracts, as well as the fact that everyone has the right to engage in business activities that are not prohibited by law. However, in the National Classifier of Ukraine, outsourcing is defined as an agreement according to which a customer delegates certain tasks to a contractor; in particular, part of the production process or the whole production process, provision of recruitment services, and support functions may be delegated.

According to Article 6 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, "The parties have the right to enter into an agreement that is not provided for by the acts of civil law, but is consistent with the general principles of civil law". In Article 627, this position is extended to include that "the parties are free to enter into a contract, select a contractor and determine the terms of the contract, taking into account the requirements of this Code, other acts of civil law, customs of business, the requirements of reasonableness and fairness." This allows the parties to determine the nature of the contract at their discretion and to include outsourcing work in it.
