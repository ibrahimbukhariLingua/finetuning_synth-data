## History

After decades of business in the coffee industry, Mrs. and Mr. Yves Baron started manufacturing their own bean-to-cup coffee brewers in 1996. In 2011, they sold the company to their son Frank Baron.

The enterprise said it was possibly the first in the world to launch Internet connected touchscreen coffeemakers in 2012.
Cafection has partnerships with Apple, Google, Aramark, Facebook, Microsoft and Bill and Melinda Gates' Foundation.

In February 2013, Cafection was named "Business of the Year" at the Fid√©ides gala, held by the Chamber of Commerce of Quebec City.
