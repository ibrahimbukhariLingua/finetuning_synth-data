Australian Communications Consumer Action Network


# Australian Communications Consumer Action Network



The **Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN)** is the peak advocacy group for Australian communications consumers. It receives Australian government funding to carry out its work, part of which ACCAN distributes to researchers.


## Government funding

ACCAN is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia under section 593 of the Telecommunications Act 1997. This funding is recovered from a levy on telecommunications carriers.


## Campaigns

ACCAN has campaigned for a government scheme to monitor NBN broadband performance. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is in the process of setting up such a scheme. It has selected SamKnows to operate the NBN testing system.

After a surge in customer complaints to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) in late 2017, ACCAN called for improved consumer protections.
