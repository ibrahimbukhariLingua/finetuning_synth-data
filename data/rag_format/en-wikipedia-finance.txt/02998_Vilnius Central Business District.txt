The **Vilnius Central Business District** (Lithuanian: *Naujasis Centras*) is a rapidly developing business district in Šnipiškės eldership of Vilnius, Lithuania. It is Lithuania's most important business district and the largest of its kind in the Baltic States.

Between 2000 and 2018, more than 480,000 square metres (5,200,000 sq ft) of floor area was added to Vilnius CBD. Most of the growth occurred after 2010, with intense growth continuing after 2020. Since 2022, Vilnius has been experiencing a large influx of foreign professionals, many of whom work in the CBD.

This area is called *Naujasis miesto centras* and abbreviated *Vilniaus NMC* in Lithuanian. The Baltasis tiltas (White Bridge) connects the area with the Naujamiestis eldership. Vilnius government has created a virtual 3D map of the area where present and future buildings can be seen.


## Buildings and organizations

Many of Lithuania's high-rise office buildings are located here, including Europa Tower, the tallest office building in the Baltic states. As of December 2023, Vilnius CBD has about a dozen high rises designed by local and foreign architecture firms including Daniel Libeskind, Lund + Slaatto Arkitekter [no], Audrius Ambrasas [lt], RSHP and others.

Large multinational corporations have their local or regional headquarters here, for example Nasdaq, Revolut, Swedbank, SEB Group, Luminor Bank, Unity Technologies, Huawei, Yara International, and Johnson & Johnson. The area is especially popular with banks and financial institutions. As of late 2022, Vilnius CBD is sparsely inhabited and is mostly filled with offices and commercial spaces. In 2022, office rental prices were ranging from 16,5 to 20 euros per square meter (appx 10.8 square feet).

Two large shopping centers are located in Vilnius CBD – VCUP and Europa.


## Sports fields

There is a White Bridge sports field next to the bridge, which hosts 9 beach volleyball courts, 3 double-sided basketball courts, a park for roller skaters and skateboarders, outdoor training grounds and children playgrounds. Various sports competitions are organised here.

Concerts, festivals and other entertainment activities are regularly hosted in a field near Vilnius CBD and the White Bridge. Annual laser show, part of "Sostinės Dienos" (English: "Capital City Days") is held here.


## Future buildings

As of late 2023, multiple high-rise buildings planned in the area, many of which have been approved by the city government. Upcoming notable buildings include:
