## Work


### Financial accounting and cost accounting

As authority in the field of cost accounting, Fells was engaged in promoting the profession and the legal status of the profession. In those days there was a big difference between financial accounting and cost accounting. Locke (1979) recalled:

> [Financial accounting was] a liberal profession made up of independent wealthy businessmen who did not work directly for industry but acted as consultants, working out of their own offices, much as lawyers do. The chartered or incorporated accountants, moreover, were not even exposed to cost accounting during their training, for as young “articled” clerks they were apprenticed to accounting offices instead of formally educated in colleges or universities. They could only learn what happened in the offices and, since the accountants seldom dealt with costing matters neither did the apprentices. The clerks who kept cost records in British industry were not chartered or incorporated accountants. They were poor, badly educated men who received what training they got on the job in a factory bookkeeping office. They hardly ever came into professional contact with public accountants who, in any case, despised them because of their lower class origins.

In 1910 J.M. Fells remarked that public accountants still "did not consider these industrial cost accountants to be engaged in accounting."
