Pawthereum


# Pawthereum



**Pawthereum** (ticker: **PAWTH**) is a decentralized, animal welfare–focused cryptocurrency created in October 2021, running on the Ethereum network. A percentage of every transaction goes to a charity wallet, and an additional percentage goes back to token holders in the form of reflections.


## History

The Pawthereum Foundation (also known as Stichting Pawthereum) was formed in the Netherlands. Pawthereum is a fork of another meme coin, GRUMPY, based on Grumpy Cat. In March 2021, the Grumpy Cat Coin project donated $70,000 in crypto funds to Sterling Animal Shelter. GRUMPY was converted into Pawthereum after a lawsuit by the owners of Grumpy Cat.

In late 2023, Pawthereum launched PawSwap, making it easier for people to buy and sell PAWTH.


### Notable donations

In addition to the $70,000 in crypto funds donated to Sterling Animal Shelter under the Grumpy name, notable donations under the Pawthereum fork include 26 ETH, valued at around $120,000 at the time, to Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home. Another was $50,000 to Four Paws USA, done as a matching donation on Giving Tuesday (November 30, 2021). The project also made a donation valued at $50,000 to Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary.

By July 2022, Pawthereum and its partners had raised $576,200 for animal welfare–focused charities, with $478,700 being donated directly by the Pawthereum team.


### Endorsement by Kevin O'Leary

Canadian businessman and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary has repeatedly endorsed the project, praising Pawtherem's utility for charitable giving that goes beyond simply being a meme coin.
