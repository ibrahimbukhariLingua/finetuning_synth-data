## European policy

In January 2018, the district executive committee and district conference of the CDU district of Viersen nominated Berger as a candidate for the 2019 European elections, as Karl-Heinz Florenz, then MEP for the Lower Rhine region, did not run again for this election due to his age. In June 2018, he was elected as a candidate for the European Parliament by the CDU Niederrhein. In a secret ballot for the recommendation for sixth place on the list, the state executive of the CDU NRW nominated Stefan Berger at the beginning of 2019 in place of the European politician Elmar Brok. This led to a strong response from several media outlets. On 26 January 2019 the NRW CDU's state representatives' meeting confirmed Berger's sixth place on the North Rhine-Westphalian electoral list for the European elections on 26 May 2019, which is considered to be a likely position from which to enter the European Parliament.

After all the votes cast in the 2019 European elections had been counted, Berger's entry into the European Parliament was officially confirmed on 27 May 2019. Berger is member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and of the Delegation for relations with Japan. He is an alternate member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL), the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) and the Delegation for bilateral relations with the Arab Peninsula. His seat neighbor in the European Parliament is Silvio Berlusconi.

Berger is part of the Federal Expert Committee on European Policy (Bundesfachausschuss Europapolitik) of the CDU/CSU.


### Positions and demands


#### Digital currency Diem

In the course of the planned launch of Facebook's digital currency Diem (formerly called Libra), Stefan Berger calls for the rapid development of a European stable coin, which could serve as a secure and stable alternative to Facebook's introduced currency. Berger regards the power of the "Libra society" as a threat to the stability of the Eurozone and a threat to European democracy. He warns that Diem should not convert Zuckerberg into central bank, argues that it is time for Europe to gather expert knowledge on Diem and to carry out a detailed impact assessment of the financial system.

Berger will be in charge of the European report of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) which will serve as base for a regulatory framework for crypto-assets.

**Presidency of the EU Commission** 

Given the withdrawal of Manfred Weber as candidate for the office of EU Commission President, Berger welcomed the nomination of Ursula von der Leyen as an alternative candidate. He described a possible failure of her election and the associated further search for candidates as a "journey to Jerusalem (musical chairs), but without chairs".
