## History

In August 2010 when DigitalMR was established, founder, Michalis Michael, had been MD for Western Europe at Masmi, and prior to that, head of the global online division at Synovate, a multinational in market research ranking number 6 globally at the time. Masmi - a current client - has supported the company from the start, in fact DigitalMR was incubated from within Masmi in London. The first advisory board was made up of the following individuals: Dr.Nicos Rossides; CEO at Masmi, Steve Alexander; president at Symmetrics, Stavros Hadjiyiangou; Managing Partner at A.T.A Associates LLP, Simon Preston; CEO at risebeyond.org and former Young Presidents' Organization international chairman, Peter Nathanial; partner at Impala partners and former Group Chief Risk Officer for RBS, and Neil Everitt; investor and entrepreneur.
In August 2011, Michalis Michael participated in an online debate on research and privacy in relation to social media, hosted by GreenBook blog. Michael supported that if the new ESOMAR and MRS guidelines on privacy, anonymity, and consent were to be implemented, software development companies would probably prevail in the sector. He was the first one to respond in this discussion through a blog post, questioning the Market Research Society's position on the subject, and argued that people posting online actually want to be heard, and are aware of the potential consequences.
In 2012, the company headquarters moved from their previous location to a larger space at Westminster Business Square in Vauxhall.

This is when the company pivoted to becoming a technology company after winning its first R&D grant from the Technology Strategy Board in the UK - now called Innovate UK. listening247 focussed on purposeful R&D for the next 7 years having won another 5 grants from Innovate UK and one from the EU.

In May 2020 the company which was already a "remore first" kind of company - nudged by the covid 19 situation - went fully distributed with its new office address at Henry Wood House in Oxford Circus in Central of London. Its current office location is at the Liberty House, on Regents str in London.

In November 2023 listening247 raised its first institutional funding round and launched a typical start-up journey as an automated audience targeting and content creation company for brands.
