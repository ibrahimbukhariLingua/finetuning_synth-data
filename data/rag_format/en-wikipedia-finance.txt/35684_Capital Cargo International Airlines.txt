# Capital Cargo International Airlines



**Capital Cargo International Airlines, Inc.** was a cargo airline based in Orlando, Florida, United States from 1995 to 2013. It provided on-demand and wet lease aircraft charter. Its main base was Orlando International Airport. It is owned by the Air Transport Services Group (Nasdaq: ATSG).

The airline ceased in name in March 2013 when it was merged with its sister airline Air Transport International.


## History

The airline was established in September 1995 and started operations in April 1996. It was founded by Peter Fox, the airline's Chairman, and obtained its operating certificate on April 24, 1996. It is wholly owned by Cargo Holdings International (CHI) and has 265 employees (at June 2011).

On November 2, 2007, Cargo Holdings International, the parent company of CCIA entered into an agreement to be acquired by Wilmington, OH-based ABX Holdings, Inc. The company along with sister company Air Transport International were run as separate companies under the Air Transport Services Group umbrella until 2013 when Capital Cargo was formally absorbed by Air Transport.

CHI and ABX Holdings have entered into an agreement under which ABX Holdings will purchase the stock of CHI. After the closing of that transaction, CHI and its wholly owned subsidiaries will be held by ABX Holdings as the parent company. ABX Air, Inc., Capital Cargo International Airlines, Inc., and Air Transport International Limited Liability Company will each continue to operate as separate and independent air carriers. Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. and LGSTX Group, Inc. will also continue to operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of CHI.
