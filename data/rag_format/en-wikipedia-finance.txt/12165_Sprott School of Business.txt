Currently, students can study Japanese, German, French, Spanish, and Mandarin, and travel on exchange to such diverse locales as Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Chile, China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Peru or Spain. These locations are based on existing exchange agreements with Carleton, as well as the availability of courses in Carleton's language programs as students are expected to complete two full-year courses of language study prior to going abroad.

It does not use technical analysis to make meaningful investment decisions but technical analysis is sometimes used to determine entrance and exit opportunities. The Sprott Student Investment Fund is run by students enrolled in the Sprott School of Business and historically has been staffed primarily by students in the undergraduate Finance concentration. Currently, the Fund has over $1M AUM.
