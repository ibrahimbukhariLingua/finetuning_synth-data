### Motor types

The Chorus Meshcon motor is a high-phase-order motor/drive system that claims to offer up to ten times the "burst", start-up, or acceleration torque of a conventional motor and drive of the same rated power and base speed.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Chorus motors claims the Meshcon Motor co-opts the harmonics that limit motor performance and that typically cause motor heating. According to these claims, a Chorus AC motor can generate far more torque than its conventional brethren. It is said to do this by changing both the layout of the magnetic coils and the power input waveforms of a standard AC induction motor.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
Another example, the Chorus Star motor, is claimed to achieve much higher torque densities than a traditional 3-phase motor, but allegedly with no cost penalty. The Chorus Star concept uses concentrated, high phase order windings.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ.

The parent company Borealis Exploration Ltd. signed an agreement with Delta Air Lines making Delta the development partner and launch customer for the Boeing 737NG version of WheelTug to allow electric ground taxi.
