# Petrom



**OMV Petrom S.A.** is a Romanian integrated oil company, controlled by Austria's OMV. It is one of the largest corporations in Romania and the largest oil and gas producer in Southeast Europe. Since 2004 it is a subsidiary of OMV. With 2022 profits of EUR 12.5 billion, as of 2023, OMV Petrom is the largest company in Romania.


## History

In late 2004, Petrom was privatized by the Romanian state and sold to Austrian oil company OMV, which acquired of the previous SNP Petrom SA. As of 2005ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, it was the largest privatization deal in Romania's history.

Until 2005, Petrom owned six offshore drilling platforms, of which five, GSP Atlas, GSP Jupiter, GSP Orizont, GSP Prometeu and GSP Saturn were sold to Grup Servicii Petroliere for US$100 million.

In January 2006, Petrom purchased OMV's operations in Romania, Bulgaria and Serbia and Montenegro. As a result of the transaction, the gas station networks of OMV were transferred to Petrom, but continued to operate under the OMV brand.

From 1 January 2010, the company changed its name to OMV Petrom.

In April 2010, OMV Petrom expanded the portfolio of its projects, in terms of electricity production, through the acquisition of 100% of the SC Wind Power Park SRL, a developer of the Dorobanţu Wind Farm.

On May 18, 2010, OMV Petrom announced the conclusion of an offshore campaign in the Lebăda Est and Lebăda Vest fields, located at the Histria block in the Black Sea. Following this offshore campaign, additional production of more than 300,000 boe was expected in 2010, from two existing wells (LO2 and LO4) and a new well drilled (LV05).

On June 1, 2010, OMV Petrom announced the start-up of the Hurezani gas delivery system, a project intended to optimize gas delivery into the national transportation network in periods when pressure in the system was very high.

On July 12, 2010, OMV Petrom announced the signing of a 15-year production enhancement contract for several fields in the area of Țicleni, Southwest Romania, with Petrofac, a leading international provider of facilities solutions to the oil and gas production and processing industry. Petrofac will perform services in the respective fields in order to maximize production while improving operational efficiency. The partnership targets cumulative production enhancement out of nine onshore fields in the Țicleni area by at least 50% in the next five years.

On September 6, 2010, OMV Petrom announced the sale of the 74.9% stake in Ring Oil (Russia) to its minority partner Mineral and Bio Oil Fuels Limited (MBO).

From October 1, 2010, OMV Petrom has completed the consolidation of marketing activities in Romania in a single entity, OMV Petrom Marketing SRL.

On December 2, 2010, OMV Petrom inaugurated Petrom City, the headquarters that hosts the company's central operations. Situated in the northern part of Bucharest, it will be used by around 2,500 employees from 7 headquarters of the company in Bucharest and Ploiești. The employee relocation process started in the fourth quarter of 2010 and was estimated to be finalized in the first half of 2011.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈⁿᵉᵉᵈˢ ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ

In 2010, OMV Petrom inaugurated the Hurezani gas delivery system, designed to optimize gas supply to the national transport network. The system included a new compressor station at Bulbuceni, and 11.5 kilometres (7.1 mi) of new pipe station. There was a new measurement system of the gas delivery point Hurezani, to adapt to changing parameters of the gas flow and pressure. The total investment budgeted amounted to about 135 million euros.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

OMV Petrom ceased importing Russian crude oil in April 2022, stating that it would instead buy crude oil for its refinery from other sources even if prices were more expensive. At the time, it was the largest energy company in Romania. Romanian investment fund Fondul Proprietatea sold the entirety of its shares in OMV Petrom in December 2022. The stake equated to roughly 2.9% of OMV Petrom's overall value, at $$159.45 million. OMV Petrom remained primarily owned by OMV in Austria. In early 2023, the company reported that it had revenues of RON 61.3 billion (EUR 12.5 billion) in 2022, which was 2.4 times higher than revenues in 2021. At the time, it was the largest company in Romania.

In February 2023 Christina Verchere remained CEO of OMV Petrom, stating the company was "closer than ever" to beginning construction on its Neptun Deep gas project in the Black Sea, with a final financial decision about the project to be made by OMV in the middle of 2023. First gas extractions were expected for 2027. With the aim of including OMV Petrom among the companies required to pay significant profits to the Romanian government, in March 2023, it was reported that lawmakers and government members in Romania were working on "amending the solidarity contribution calculation methodology." OMV Petrom had previously declared it was not liable to pay the solidarity contributions, due to existing regulations. For companies that produce and refine crude oil, the 2022 Romanian solidarity law introduced to take surplus profits, gave the obligation to pay RON 350 for each tonne of crude oil processed in 2022 and 2023.


## Operations

Apart from its operations in Romania, the company operates in Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Iran and Russia. In Moldova, OMV Petrom has operated 73 filling stations, being one of the leading oil companies, alongside Lukoil. In Hungary, there have been at least 2 OMV Petrom filling stations.

OMV Petrom has operated in several countries:

* Romania - largest company;
* Moldova - 2nd largest company, 31% market share;
* Bulgaria - 3rd largest company, 18% market share;
* Serbia and Montenegro - 3rd largest company, 13% market share.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2007 the company produced 5.5 billion cubic metres (190 billion cubic feet) of natural gas and 191,000 barrels per day (30,400 m³/d) of crude oil.


## Privatization controversy

The OMV Petrom privatization took place during the last months of the Adrian Năstase government. In December 2004, OMV obtained a 51% stake in SNP Petrom SA.

Major Romanian newspapers published articles criticising the privatization of Petrom, on the grounds that last-minute unadvertised moves gave Petrom all of Romania's oil and gas reserves just before the privatization contract was signed. It was claimed that this move gave away the control of the country's national resources

As a consequence, OMV Petrom has a *de facto* monopoly on the oil production of Romania. Moreover, the state did not impose price controlling clauses in the privatization contract, so that Romanian-produced petroleum is sold in Romania at the same price as imported petroleum.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
