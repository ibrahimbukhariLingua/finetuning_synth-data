## History

Varengold was founded in 1995 by Yasin Sebastian Qureshi and Timur Coban as an asset management boutique.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Since the company was founded, the focus of its business activities has initially been on derivatives brokerage and services in the area of alternative investments such providing trading in contracts for difference (CFDs).

In 1998, Varengold was granted a credit institution license by the then Federal Banking Supervisory Office (*Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen*). In June 2013 Varengold was granted a license as a deposit-taking bank.

Since 20 March 2007, the Varengold shares have been listed in the unofficial market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the Entry Standard market segment. With the discontinuation of the Entry Standard on 1 March 2017, Varengold moved to the Basic Board.


## Criticism

*The Jerusalem Post* reported in October 2018 that Varengold was said to have been doing business with Iran Air at that time despite US sanctions.

The Varengold investment subsidiary was involved in cum-ex transactions. As of 2018, possible claims in the high double-digit millions still burden the bank's balance sheets. The public prosecutor's office in Cologne is investigating the former responsible persons from Varengold due to a particularly serious case of tax evasion.

In August 2020, the credit house was searched by investigators due to the cum-ex investigations.

On June 27, 2023, BaFin prohibited Varengold Bank AG from conducting transactions with "payment agents" and other third parties related to Iran due to high money laundering risks and serious deficits in money laundering prevention.
