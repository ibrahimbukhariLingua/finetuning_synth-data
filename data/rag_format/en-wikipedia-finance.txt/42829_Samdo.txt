## Corporate History

Founded in 1960, Samdo Group was a multinational conglomerate that placed in the top 50 in the South Korean economy. It was the first company in South Korea (with Chunwoosa) to export clothing. In 1980s~90s, it operated in 14 countries with approximately 9,000 employees. Samdo received the Gold Tower, the Silver Tower, and the Bronze Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit awards, as well as several Presidential Commendation. In 1979, it was rewarded the "100 Million Dollar Tower" for playing a pioneering role in clothing exports by recording $100 million worth of exports of a single textile product. The Group was dismantled in the early 2000s due to the foreign exchange financial crisis.


### Founding and growth

The Samdo Trading Corporation was founded in 1960 by Kim Man-Joong. It pioneered the export of manufactured clothing products in South Korea.

The company expanded, and factories were established in Suyoung in 1966 and in Eonyang in 1971.

In 1973, Samdo established an additional zipper factory in Eonyang, South Gyeongsang Province, in partnership with German and American zipper brands to support domestic apparel companies that were experiencing difficulties in delivery of manufactured clothing goods. At the time, sewing and manufactured clothing goods were the primary goods of export industry in Korea. Based on the three years of experience with international partners, Samdo developed its own zipper brand, 'DULON’, in 1977 and began producing nylon, plastic, and metal zippers.

In 1963, Samdo Trading Corporation exported $800,000, $2.7 million in 1965, and $35 million in 1973. In November 1979, it achieved $100 million in exports with a single clothing product for the first time in South Korea.


### Business diversification

In 1976, Samdo Trading Corporation went public by listing its shares on the stock exchange. Meanwhile, a new Gyeongju factory was established, and Samdo Electronics, which produced car stereos, was established.

In 1977, Daeshin Trading Co., was acquired, and the zipper factory was doubled.

In the mid-1980s, Samdo Group expanded its business areas to manufacturing and selling leisure goods, art and durable goods. It also expanded to seafood businesses.

In 1990, Samdo Group established P.T Samdonesia in Indonesia in 1989 and Cosmo Macky Industries in Sri Lanka.


### Financial difficulties and dissolution

In the late 1980s, as the textile export economy declined, sales of Samdo Trading Corporation, the parent company, continued to decline. In the 1990s, the corporation was pushed out of the top 50 companies of Korea.

In 1991, a new third office building of 21-story was built in Seoul within the four main gates. It was built on a 1,200-pyeong site across from the Security Headquarters in Sunhwa-dong (currently the National Police Agency), with a total floor area of 13,000 pyeong.

In 1992, Seowoo Co. was renamed as Samdo Apparel. That same year, the U.S. branches, the Chicago branch and the New York branch, which was located in the Empire State Building, were closed.

On February 27, 1995, Samdo Group applied for court receivership. During this period, Samdo Electric, Samdo Industry, Samdo Chemical, Donghae Terminal, Samdo Guam Hotel and Pungmu Engineering were sold. On December 12, it was decided for the Group to begin liquidation.

In 2000, to normalize management, as a merger and acquisition, the Group was taken over by SB Finance Korea (Softbank) in December of that year. Accordingly, in February 2002, the procedure for reorganization was concluded.
