Typically, the phrase "international business strategy" refers to the plans and actions of companies (public or private) rather than of governments; as such, the goal of such a strategy involves increased profit.

Most companies of any appreciable size deal with at least one international partner at some point in their supply chain, and in most well-established commercial markets competition operates internationally. Because methods of transacting commercial operations vary appreciably in different countries, an understanding of cultural and linguistic barriers, political and legal systems, and the many complexities of international trade is essential to commercial success.·∂ú‚Å±·µó·µÉ·µó‚Å±·µí‚Åø ‚Åø·µâ·µâ·µà·µâ·µà

## Philosophy

The three most prevalent philosophies of international business strategy are:

* **industry-based**, which argues that conditions within a particular industry determine strategy;
* **resource-based**, which argues that firm-specific differences determine strategy;
* **institution-based**, which argues that the industry- and resource-based views need to be supplemented by accounting for relevant societal differences of the types mentioned above.
