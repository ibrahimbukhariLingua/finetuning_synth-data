#### Workers advocacy

During the fall of 1999, James led a campaign called the "Roast Starbucks Campaign" with Global Exchange to persuade Starbucks to use Fair trade coffee in every one of their stores. In an interview, James explained how the Global Exchange campaign included several demonstrations in cities and mailed in letters to Starbucks demanding the use of Fair trade coffee, all organized by Global Exchange.

The Marxist magazine *Political Affairs* called James a "Venezuela expert" and that *U.S. Intervention in Venezuela: A Clear and Present Danger* "tells a shocking tale of US intervention in Venezuela’s democratic process, examines a series of myths about Venezuela, and offers an explanation of the real concerns underlying the Bush administration’s antagonism towards Venezuela" and how the publication "offers US citizens some concrete ways we can get involved". In the publication, James used some of work from Eva Golinger's *Chávez Code*.
