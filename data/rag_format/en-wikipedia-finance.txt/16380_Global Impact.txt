## Research

In 2014, Global Impact released "The Corporate Signature Program: A Custom Approach to Philanthropy", a white paper examining the growing practice of signature programs in corporate social investments. The white paper looked at why corporations invest in signature programs, what companies seek to achieve through their giving, what steps to take to create a signature program, and what types of models can be used for program management. It also provided examples of how some U.S. corporations have built their own successful signature programs.

In 2017, Global Impact released “Donor Advised Funds: Democratizing Philanthropy to Change the World.” The white paper examines how donor advised funds (DAFs) can democratize personal giving in and beyond the workplace, and how employers can use DAFs to tie philanthropy to corporate social responsibility programs.

In 2018, Global Impact and KPMG released the 2018 Giving Global Matrix, providing a snapshot of the complex and varied tax laws that incentivize, or disincentivize, philanthropic giving in 60 countries across North America, Latin America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
