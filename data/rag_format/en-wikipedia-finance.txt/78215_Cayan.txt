## History

Cayan was founded as Merchant Warehouse in 1998 by current CEO Henry Helgeson. Helgeson was working as a payment terminal salesman in upstate New York, and realized the still-nascent Internet could allow him to sell terminals at much lower margins. He focused on early internet search engines like Alta Vista.

The company grew over the ensuing decades. In 2013, Cayan opened a technology development center in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

On December 18, 2017, it was announced that Cayan would be acquired by TSYS in an all-cash deal valuing the company at approximately $1.05 billion.
