Kocho Junisen


# Kocho Junisen



*kōchō jūnisen* (皇朝十二銭) (aka *jūnizeni*) is a general term for 12 types of copper coins minted in Japan under the Ritsuryo system from 708 (Wadō 1st year) to 963 (Ōwa 3rd year). All of the included coins are circular in shape, have a square hole in the center, and were worth 1 mon.


## History

Japan's first formal currency system was the *Kōchōsen* (Japanese: 皇朝銭, "Imperial currency"). It was exemplified by the adoption of Japan's first official coin type, the *Wadōkaichin*. It was first minted in 708 CE on order of Empress Genmei, Japan's 43rd Imperial ruler. *"Wadōkaichin"* is the reading of the four characters printed on the coin, and is thought to be composed of the era name Wadō (和銅, "Japanese copper"), which could alternatively mean "happiness", and "Kaichin", thought to be related to "Currency".

The *Kōchōsen* Japanese system of coinage became strongly debased, with its metallic content and value decreasing. By the middle of the 9th century, the value of a coin in rice had fallen to 1/150th of its value of the early 8th century. By the end of the 10th century, compounded with weaknesses in the political system, this led to the abandonment of the national currency, with the return to rice as a currency medium. The last official Japanese coin emission occurred in 958, with very low quality coins called *Kengen Taihō* (乾元大宝), which soon fell into disuse.
