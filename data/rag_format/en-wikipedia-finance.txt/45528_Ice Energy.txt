The contracts totaled 25.6 megawatts.

In December 2019, the company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

A reinvigorated version of the company began operating a 25.6 mwh energy storage program in southern California in 2020, supporting 100 customer sites. This program provided more than 45 GWh by October 2024. The company claimed that the program had reduced customer bills by 20%.
