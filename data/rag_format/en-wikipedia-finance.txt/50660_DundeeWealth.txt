DundeeWealth


# DundeeWealth



**DundeeWealth Inc.** was a Canadian financial services company, formerly a public company and subsidiary of Dundee Corporation.

DundeeWealth Inc. and its advisor network were acquired by Scotiabank on February 1, 2011. DundeeWealth Inc. has been renamed HollisWealth Inc. and effective November 1, 2013, HollisWealth replaced DundeeWealth as the brand name used by Scotiabank to identify one of Canada's largest independent financial advisor networks. The name HollisWealth is derived from the location of Scotiabank's historic head office building which was constructed more than 175 years ago, in 1837, at 188 Hollis Street in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
In 2017, iA Financial Group acquired HollisWealth from Scotiabank and merged its Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada-regulated arm with iA Securities and its Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada-regulated arm with Investia Financial Services Inc. Post-merger, HollisWealth advisor teams continued to use the HollisWealth brand.
