Fair Mortgage Collaborative


# Fair Mortgage Collaborative



**Fair Mortgage Collaborative** (**FMC**) is a non-profit organization created by the Ford Foundation and the Heron Foundation in 2009 to combat the abusive practices of predatory lending in the US home mortgage world. The company's main objective is to help consumers avoid predatory lenders and brokers, and enable them to obtain safe, fairly priced loans.


## Work

To combat predatory lending, the Fair Mortgage Collaborative certifies mortgage lenders, brokers, credit unions, and community banks as "Fair and Safe" based on the "Fair and Safe Lending Standards" they established. These standards were developed, written, and approved by mortgage industry thought leaders; mortgage industry loan officers, brokers, advocates; and other mortgage experts. The standards are strict and the certification process is lengthy. Once the lender is approved, they can place the "Fair Loan Certification" seal on their website and collateral. The Fair Mortgage Collaborative continues to watch each lender's loans to ensure their continuing compliance with the standards.

Most recently, with the passing of the Dodd-Frank bill, many of the Fair Mortgage Collaborative's standards have been set into law. However, there is a general apprehension among experts in the home mortgage field that many unscrupulous lenders will continue to find loopholes and abuse consumers. Therefore, the Fair Mortgage Collaborative is currently undergoing some changes to make their organization more consumer and research-focused. They are creating an easy-to-use portal of information to help guide consumers to "fair and safe" loans. They also plan to participate in mortgage abuse research and publish white papers with their sister non-profit and mortgage advocacy organizations to help keep mortgage lenders fair and safe for everyone. They will also establish the "Fairness Forum", a social community where borrowers can share information with other lenders in a safe environment. The goal is to help consumers "blow the whistle" on unfair practices.
