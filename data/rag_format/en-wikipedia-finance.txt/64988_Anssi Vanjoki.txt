## Personal life

In October 2001, Vanjoki received a fine for speeding, i.e. 690 000 marks (about 116 000 euros). The fine sparked a social debate and, among others, according to the Minister of Justice Johannes Koskinen, "the entire system of fines has to be revised due to the shortcomings written into the law". In February 2002, the Helsinki District Court reduced Vanjoki's fine to 35 000 marks (about 5 900 euros), because according to the salary statements submitted by Nokia, Vanjoki's income had decreased.

Vanjoki is the father of basketball players Anselmi and Viljami Vanjoki.
