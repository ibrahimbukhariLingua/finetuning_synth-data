# Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh



**Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh** (19 September 1910 â€“ 13 June 2000) was an Indian real estate developer known for founding DLF, then known as Delhi Land and Finance, in 1946. He laid the foundations for one of India's largest real estate companies, instrumental in transforming the urban landscape of Delhi and Gurgaon.


## Early life

Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh was born on 19 September 1910 in Haryana, India, into an agricultural family.


## Business career

In 1946, Singh Singh established DLF, then known as Delhi Land and Finance, with the aim of developing urban residential colonies in the capital city of Delhi. His early projects included the creation of neighborhoods like South Extension, Greater Kailash, and Hauz Khas in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1961, the Indian government transferred urban development control to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which restricted private real estate development in Delhi. This prompted Singh and his son-in-law, Kushal Pal Singh, to look for new opportunities outside the capital. DLF shifted its focus to Gurgaon (now Gurugram), where his and Kushal Pal's business plans led to the region's transformation into a modern urban hub. In 1995, Kushal Pal became the chairman of DLF.


## Personal life

Singh had a daughter Indira. Indira married Kushal Pal. Singh died on 13 June 2000.


## Legacy

After Singh's death, his son-in-law, Kushal Pal, expanded DLF into the largest real estate company in India.
