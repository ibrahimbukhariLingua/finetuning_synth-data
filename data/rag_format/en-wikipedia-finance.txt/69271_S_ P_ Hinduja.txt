Hinduja began his career in his father's textile and trading businesses in Bombay, India, and Tehran, Iran. His successful businesses in his early career included the sale of food commodities (onions and potatoes) and iron ore from India to Iran.

With the acquisition of Ashok Leyland (from British Leyland) and Gulf Oil (from Chevron) in the 1980s and the establishment of banks in Switzerland and India in the 1990s, Hinduja became one of India's best-known business tycoons alongside such names as Tata, Birla, and Ambani. In 2012, the Group acquired the US firm Houghton International, the world's largest metal fluids manufacturer, for $1.045 billion, forming a consortium with the help of Ghouse Mohammed Asif, (Director of Private Equity of JP Morgan) and Henry Paulson, former United States Secretary of the Treasury and formerly of Goldman Sachs.

Hinduja's business approach was conservative and opportunistic, investing in diversified business sectors ranging from oil and gas, banking and finance, and IT to real estate, energy and chemicals, power, and media and entertainment.

As of March 2019, *Forbes* ranked SP and GP Hinduja as the 65th richest in the world, with a net worth of $16.9 billion, with Forbes India estimating his net worth at $18 billion. This made him the 4th wealthiest Indian-origin business magnate in the world.

He had secretly married Ninotchka Sargon, a Roman Catholic Australian, at Chelsea Register Office in January that year.

In 2001, Hinduja was involved in the UK's "cash-for-passports" scandal, where he donated money for the Millennium Dome while applying for British citizenship, leading to the resignation of Peter Mandelson.
