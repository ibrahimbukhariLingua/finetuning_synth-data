# German Institute for Economic Research



The **German Institute for Economic Research** (German: *Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung*), or, more commonly **DIW Berlin**, is a economic research institute in Germany, involved in economic research and policy advice. According to Repec, it is among the top-10 percent of non-profit economic research institutions worldwide. Financed with public grants from the Berlin Senate Department for Economics, Technology and Research and the Federal Department for Economics and Technology. DIW Berlin was founded in 1925 as the Institute for Business Cycle Research and took its current name in 1943.

DIW Berlin presents its research results in science journals, within the scope of national and international scientific events as well as at workshops, symposia and colloquia. Current economic and structural data, forecasts and advice as well as services in the area of quantitative economics are provided to decision makers in economics and policy and the broad public. Furthermore, the research results often meet with a major response in the news media.

### Research departments

The institute is divided into ten research departments, which are:

* The **Department of Macroeconomics** focuses on the empirical and theoretical analysis of aggregate economic developments as well as national and international economic policy.
* The **Department Forecasting and Economic Policy** uses modern macroeconomic methods to analyze economic policy issues. Economic forecasting is a key component of the department's work.
* The Department of **International Economics** focuses on monetary and financial issues affecting the global economy. It concentrates on two key activities: examining international financial markets in terms of their economic functionality and analyzing the contribution of financial development to the goal of shared growth in developing and emerging countries.
* The **Department of Energy, Transportation and Environment** researches different strategies of sustainable development in energy, transportation and the environment in order to formulate sound policy recommendations.
* The **Department Climate Policy** uses empirical and theoretical methods to explore Germany and Europe's transition to sustainable energy—for example, by analyzing policies related to energy efficiency in buildings as well as the shift to sustainable, climate-friendly power production.
* The **Department of Competition and Consumers** aims to produce robust evidence of how society and markets function. Its research combines approaches from industrial economics with behavioral and experimental economics, thus enabling a comprehensive analysis of strategic interactions, market allocations, and human behavior.
* The **Department of Firms and Markets** analyzes firms’ strategic behavior and its impact on efficiency, productivity, and growth as well as the institutional and political environment in which firms operate.
* The **Department of Public Economics** analyzes how financial, fiscal, and social policies influence economic decisions made by individuals, households, and companies.
* The **Department of Education and Family** explores education and family-related issues primarily from a microeconomic perspective. One key question is the extent to which it is possible to fully develop the human potential of a country's economy.
* The **Socio-Economic Panel Study** (SOEP) is a research-based infrastructure facility at DIW Berlin funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and state governments. The SOEP is one of the world's largest and longest-running surveys of individuals and private households. Numerous studies based on SOEP data examine mechanisms behind the distribution of social resources.

## Graduate Center

Since 2006 the Graduate Center (GC) of DIW Berlin offers about 15 scholarships per year for PhD positions in economics in cooperation with Berlin's largest universities: Free University of Berlin, Humboldt University of Berlin, and Technische Universität Berlin. The Graduate Center is located within the DIW building in the center of Berlin. The academic research of students focuses on applied topics. The four-year program is divided into two parts: while students receive academic training in economics and related social sciences during the first year, in years two to four on-the-job training in DIW research projects leads them to complete their doctoral theses. The application period is between January and March.


## Co-operations

A broad range of predominantly external Research Directors, Research Professors and Research Affiliates research along with the employees of DIW Berlin. They co-operate for a specific time, perform cross sectional tasks, care about scientific surveys (such as diploma thesis, dissertations) and release important pulses for the institute.

The DIW is also part of the Leibniz Association, (*Leibniz-Gemeinschaft*), a collection of non-university research institutes in Germany. Along with five other leading institutes, the DIW publishes a joint report on the state of the German economy, the Gemeinschaftsdiagnose (Joint Economic Forecast).


## Financing

More than half of the Institute's budget is derived from public grants, which DIW Berlin receives as research funding from the State of Berlin and the Federal Government in equal parts. This sum is supplemented by income from projects, research contracts with third parties, trustee memberships and donations. Because of its financial structure DIW Berlin is member of the Leibniz Association (WGL).

In 2022, news media reported critically about payments made by Uber to prominent academics and highlighted the role of a consultancy arm of DIW. DIW, in collaboration with Justus Haucap, had agreed to produce a study on “consumer benefits from a liberalisation of the German taxi market”, for what a news leak suggested was a fee of €48,000 plus VAT. Haucap launched the report at events for influencers and politicians in Berlin.
