## History

In 1987, energy executives Howard Hawks, Tom Hendricks, Max Williams, and Gary Hoover launched Tenaska with the idea that success in an evolving energy industry was a job best suited for a small, private company. Their goal was to build one or two power plants; the company has now built a total of 17.

The company later established affiliates to focus on multiple aspects of the energy industry. Tenaska Marketing Ventures (TMV) manages, trades or sells approximately 10 percent of the total natural gas consumption of the United States and Canada. Similarly, Tenaska Power Services Co.
