## History

SolarEdge was established in 2006 by Guy Sella, Lior Handelsman, Yoav Galin, Meir Adest and Amir Fishelov. The company was backed by venture capital from GE Energy Financial Services, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, ORR Partners, Genesis Partners, Walden International, Vertex Ventures Israel, JP Asia Capital and Opus Capital Ventures.

The company started mass production of its products by contract manufacturer Flex at the end of 2009.

In March 2015, SolarEdge had an initial public offering of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share, raising $126 million. The shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “SEDG.” Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank acted as joint book-running managers for the offering.

In May 2015, SolarEdge partnered with Tesla Energy to develop an inverter that could charge the Tesla Powerwall home energy storage battery that was unveiled in April 2015. The SolarEdge inverter manages both the conversion of energy from solar panels along with charging and discharging of the Powerwall.
