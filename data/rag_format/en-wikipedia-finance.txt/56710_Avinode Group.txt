# Avinode Group



**Avinode Group** is a Swedish B2B technology company focused on business aviation. It specializes in operating the Avinode Marketplace, an online marketplace for private air charter.


## History

Avinode was founded in 2002 by three Chalmers University of Technology, graduates Niklas Berg, Per Marthinsson, and Niclas Wennerholm. At this point in time, operators and brokers relied primarily on phone calls and faxes to source and schedule aircraft. Berg, Marthinsson, and Wennerholm created an online marketplace called the Avinode Marketplace, which quickly gained traction. In 2010, Avinode acquired its US marketplace competitor, CharterX. As of 2018, an average of 7,000 aviation professionals use the system daily, approximately 3,200 aircraft are listed in the marketplace, and nearly 300,000 flight requests are processed monthly. Roughly 80% of professionals in the business aviation industry use Avinode Group products.
