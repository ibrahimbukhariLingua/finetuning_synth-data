Helzberg Diamonds


# Helzberg Diamonds



**Helzberg Diamonds** is a jewelry retailer founded in 1915 by Morris Helzberg that has 210 stores in 36 US states.


## Leadership

In April 2009, Beryl Raff, former executive vice president and general merchandise manager of fine jewelry at JCPenney, was named chairman and chief executive officer of Helzberg. Raff was succeeded at CEO in 2022 by Brad Hampton.


## History

Soon after Helzberg's founding, Morris Helzberg became ill and the company was taken over by his son, Barnett Helzberg Sr., at the age of 14. In 1963, Barnett Sr. became Chairman of the Board and his son, Barnett Helzberg Jr., took over company operations.
Barnett replaced his father in the Chairman position in 1988. Barnett Jr. sold the company to Berkshire Hathaway, owned by Warren Buffett, in 1995, and authored the book *What I Learned Before I Sold to Warren Buffett*

In 2017, Helzberg closed several stores, though customers who purchased Lifetime Care warranties are still able to utilize other stores for regular cleanings and inspections, or mail the jewelry to the company's service center.
