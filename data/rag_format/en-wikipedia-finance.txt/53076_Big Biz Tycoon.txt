## Gameplay


### Overview

The objective of the game is to create a successful business by developing products. As products are sold, the player earns money depending on the production rate and price of the product. This enables them to hire employees and decorate the office building. The products manufactured include game software, business software, military gear, medicine, clothing, toys, books, sports equipment, etc.

Hired workers are assigned to projects according to their abilities, and must develop and market a product. In addition, the owner of the business has the option to purchase a gift and offer it to one of the employees, which will improve one of their abilities.
