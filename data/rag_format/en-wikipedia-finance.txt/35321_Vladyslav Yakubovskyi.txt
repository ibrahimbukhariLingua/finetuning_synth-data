## Corruption scandals


### Misappropriation of the "Kyoto Protocol" budget

In 2011, Yakubovsky was appointed the head of Derzhecoinvest, an agency established to implement the Kyoto Protocol agreements and manage funds invested by other countries to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

Two of these firms, Stroyinvest 2007 and AntiTrade, had previously been implicated in dubious dealings with Ukrzaliznytsia.

By November 2012, it emerged that almost no progress had been made on the project. An investigation by "Ukrainska Pravda" found connections between all three intermediary companies and a figure known as Yuriy "Yenakiyevskyi".

In a 2012 letter to then-Prime Minister Mykola Yanovych Azarov, Yakubovsky lamented the lack of support from Kyoto Protocol countries, except Russia and Belarus. Furthermore, a delegation led by Yakubovsky declared in a UN conference in November 2012 that Ukraine aimed to increase carbon emissions.

to the then Prime Minister Mykola Yanovych Azarov, in which he complained that none of the Kyoto Protocol participating countries (except Russia and Belarus) supported Ukraine's desire to continue receiving assistance without reducing emissions. In other words, without fulfilling the main condition of the Kyoto Protocol. And in November 2012, a delegation chaired by Yakubovsky announced at a UN conference that Ukraine plans to increase carbon emissions.

Yakubovsky's involvement persisted even after his removal and the Euromaidan-led government change. In 2014, revelations showed that the Kyoto Protocol's funds were still being overseen by Volodymyr Volodymyrovych Bandurov, with Yakubovsky as his assistant.


### Supply of substandard food products for the armed forces of Ukraine

From November 2008 to September 2009, Yakubovsky served as the deputy director of "Mezon-K." In the spring of 2009, this company was involved in a scandal over the embezzlement of funds for army food. It purchased products at a price twice the market value and did not verify expenses. The company "Epifit", to which "Mezon-K" transferred money, turned out to be fictitious.

The lobbyist for "Mezon-K" was Mykhailo Yezhel, then the chief inspector of the MOD. According to an investigation by Tetiana Chornovol, Mykhailo Yezhel advanced in the Ministry thanks to the protection of Yuriy Ivanyushchenko. The same investigation mentions another person connected with Ivanyushchenko, Dmytro Medvedev — later he will appear in the list of one of Yakubovsky's companies.

In 2010, the "Mirror Weekly" publication alleged that some firms, including "Mezon-K," were implicated in orchestrated food poisoning incidents to push for new suppliers.


### Tender machinations of the "Trade Commodity" company system

"Trade Commodity" is a conglomerate that burgeoned after Petro Poroshenko's election as president. It rapidly became one of Ukraine's most significant tender victors and fuel importers.

The company's political shield was allegedly Oleksandr Hranovsky, with businessman Andriy Adamovskyi as the main investor and Vladyslav Yakubovskyi in charge.

In April 2016, the Ministry of Defense held a tender for fuel procurement which "Trade Commodity" won, pledging to supply fuel worth 1.24 billion hryvnias. An investigation by "Mirror Weekly" suggests that price manipulations led the Ministry of Defense to overpay by at least 100 million hryvnias.

In 2018, NABU (National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine) concluded its pre-trial investigation, implicating several individuals, including officials from the Ministry of Defense and the owner of "Trade Commodity." By 2019, NABU had formally charged these individuals concerning the tender.


### Tender machinations of the "Torum" company

The "Torum" office was located in the "Eurasia" business center in Kyiv, alongside the offices of Alexander Hranovskyi and Andriy Adamovskyi.

After introducing a certification for companies supplying oil to Ukrainian Railways (UZ), "Torum" became one of two firms granted permission. The other, "Agrinol", has ties to former MP Oleksandr Ponomarev.

In September 2020, Ukrainian Railways' tender department leadership changed, with Timur Valiev overseeing tenders. Just a month later, UZ experienced a fuel crisis. Most companies that won fuel tenders declined to supply at the agreed rates due to rising diesel market prices. "Torum", the major supplier from that tender, was the first to decline. After extensive negotiations, UZ paid 30% more.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### Tender disruptions

In spring 2017, Ukrzaliznytsia announced a 304 million hryvnia tender to acquire 250 freight semi-trailers. Of the three participating companies — Kriukivskyi, Popasnianskyi plants, and "Maksmed International" — the latter entered despite only providing one out of the required two similar work contracts. "Maksmed International" (a part of the "Trade Commodity" group) also won another Ukrzaliznytsia tender worth 60 million hryvnia.

During the tender process, Maksmed approached the Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) and removed the Kriukivskyi plant from the competition. After this, "Maksmed" challenged a series of Ukrzaliznytsia tenders, blocking the procurement of carriages amounting to nearly 8 billion hryvnia. "Ekonomichna Pravda" found out that the mass challenges to the tenders began when "Maksmed International" was re-registered under Yulia Pavlichenko.

In 2017 alone, "Maksmed" filed 157 complaints about procurements, mainly concerning Ukrzaliznytsia's purchases. VoxUkraine researched and found that the company did not participate in the disputed tenders and concluded that the company's actions could be interpreted as sabotage.


### VAT reimbursement

Despite the government setting a zero VAT rate on fuel for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense still paid its suppliers 7% VAT. Investigations in 2022 revealed a private supplier's manipulation of funds meant for tax repayment to the state. This supplier, linked to the companies of Vladyslav Yakubovsky, sold fuel to the state at an inflated rate.


### Attempt to undermine Ministry of Defense's open tenders

NTK "Electronprylad" is an enterprise participating in Ukrainian combat aviation modernization programs, specifically manufacturing onboard general systems of embedded control and crew warning for MiG-29 and SU-27 aircraft.

According to the Bureau of Economic Security of Ukraine, "Trade Commodity" companies used the state enterprise as a cover for non-commodity operations.

CoralEnergy, a key fuel supplier, replaced ProtonEnergyGroup S.A. in 2021 and began delivering "Rosneft" products to Ukraine. The sale of solvent by LLC "Himprodukt Plus" to "Electronprylad" resulted in a loss of over 120 million UAH, as the selling price was below the cost of its components.
