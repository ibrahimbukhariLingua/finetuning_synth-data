# CU (store)



**CU** (Korean: 씨유; RR: *Ssiyu*) (KRX: 027410) is a South Korean convenience store chain owned and operated by BGF Retail. It was formed after FamilyMart's franchise license in South Korea expired.


## History

In 1990, the Bogwang Group formed a license contract with FamilyMart to launch convenience stores under the FamilyMart brand in South Korea. The first FamilyMart in South Korea opened in October 1990. On December 1, 1994, the Bogwang Group established a separate corporation; Bogwang FamilyMart (now the BGF Group) to oversee its convenience store operations division. The chain enjoyed steady growth, reaching 2,000 stores in 2003 and 5,000 stores by 2010.

Bogwang FamilyMart officially changed its name to BGF Retail on June 8, 2012, and subsequently announced the launching of its new convenience store brand "CU". South Korea's FamilyMart was officially renamed to CU on August 1, 2012, along with the opening of the first store utilizing the new name. The change came as BGF Retail aimed to create a "Korean-style" convenience store and cease its payment of royalties to FamilyMart.

In April 2019, CU has started a delivery service, and magnified the service to 1000 stores in May.

in Oct 2024, Convenience store CU announced that it has introduced the industry's first door-to-door home delivery service.
