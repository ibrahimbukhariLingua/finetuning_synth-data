## Controversies

He said that to change a company it's necessary to "physically destroy" centres of power that oppose change, "hitting" them so "to spark fear in the organization". He later apologized with a letter to Enel's employees.

In early 2022, Francesco came under criticism for meeting in person with acting President of Russia Vladimir Putin to discuss massive Russian investments & sanction exemptions, just over a week prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
