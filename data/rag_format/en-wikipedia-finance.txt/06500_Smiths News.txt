## History

The company, originally established as "WHSmith News", was renamed Smiths News PLC on its demerger from WHSmith on 1 September 2006.

In April 2014, the company rebranded as Connect Group PLC to reflect the diversity of the company's markets.

The company purchased Tuffnells Parcels Express for more than £100m in November 2014 but, after several years of poor performance under the group's stewardship, sold it for £15m in April 2020.

In October 2020 Connect Group PLC changed its name back to Smiths News PLC.
