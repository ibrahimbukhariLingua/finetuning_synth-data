## History

The site used to be occupied by the second Grand Central Palace exhibition hall, which was demolished in 1964 to make way for 245 Park Avenue. The building was previously named for American Tobacco Company, American Brands, and Bear Stearns at various points in its history.

In 1987, Bear Stearns signed a lease for more than 500,000 square feet (46,000 m²) of space as its new headquarters and moved 3,000 of the company's employees into the building.

In November 2000, JPMorgan Chase leased 580,000 square feet (54,000 m²) in the building, creating a corporate campus with the company's nearby headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.

On March 20, 2017, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group announced a deal to acquire the building for $2.21 billion from Brookfield Property Partners and the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System, one of the highest prices ever paid for a New York skyscraper. HNA financed the acquisition with a $1.75 billion loan from a consortium of lenders including J.P. Morgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Natixis and Societe Generale in addition to $568 million of mezzanine financing. CBRE Group and Cooper-Horowitz made the deal for the loan, acting as commercial mortgage brokers.

Following financial difficulties at HNA in 2018, the conglomerate committed to selling off $22 billion in stocks and real estate assets. Part of this commitment included the sale of a $148 million stake in 245 Park Avenue to office REIT SL Green, which was also appointed as property manager and leasing manager. SL Green took over the entire property in late 2022 after HNA went bankrupt. The next year, Japanese developer Mori Trust agreed to buy a 49.9% interest in the building from SL Green. By mid-2024, the owners were renovating the building and adding a golf lounge, restaurant, wellness center, and communal rooftop space. At the time, the building's mortgage was classified as a "loan of concern" because two large tenants were moving out.
