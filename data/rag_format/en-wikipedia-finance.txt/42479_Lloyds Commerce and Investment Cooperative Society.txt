# Lloyds Commerce and Investment Cooperative Society Limited



**Lloyds Commerce and Investment Cooperative Society Limited** (Bengali: লয়েডস কমার্স অ্যান্ড ইনভেস্টমেন্ট কো-অপারেটিভ সোসাইটি লিমিটেড) was a Banladeshi non-bank financial institution. Prior to its failure the investment society had around 2,000 customers.

In 2015, the bank made national news when the managing director Md Firoz Kabir embezzled nearly Tk 1.40 billion from the institution by distributing the funds to himself and various non-members such as his daughter Rezwana Kabir, brother Nawroj Kabir, sister-in-law Sabira Banu, brother-in-law Kazi Mafizul Islam, cousin Syed Anwarul Nafis, friend Azizur Rahman, and his wife Sheli Rahman. It is suspected that he used the customers' money to purchase a second home in Malaysia and is now in hiding. A number of cases are also pending against Lloyds Commerce and Investment Co-operative Society and related company Chartered Credit Cooperative Limited.


## Embezzlement

A complaint of embezzlement has been made against Lloyds Commerce and Investment Cooperative Society Limited located in Motijheel of the capital.

With the help of Sherebangla Nagar Thana police, the member of the management council of the organization Md. Feroz Kabir and Azizur Rahman were arrested and handed over to Motijheel police station.

The investors have formed a committee with 12 active members to recover the deposits, and a number of members of the cooperatives have filed 18 cases against Firoz Kabir. Syed Anwarul Zakir, a former army official, and an uncle of Firoz Kabir, is the president of the committee. He sent a letter to the Department of Cooperatives asking for assistance about Firoz's bail and requested to suspend 18 cases on 4 August. He then said it was possible to recover money by opening the cooperatives again if Kabir was granted bail. He was released on bail and he and his family disappeared.

In January 2019, the Department of Cooperatives sent a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs (Bangladesh) to restrict the top officials of the cooperatives from leaving the country, but the ministry only got passport details of six people. As a result, it could not be confirmed whether they are in the country or have gone abroad.


### Victims
