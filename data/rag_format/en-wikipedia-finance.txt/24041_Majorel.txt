## History

In September 2018, Bertelsmann and Saham announced plans to merge their global customer services businesses. The two companies had already worked together successfully in this area. Following approval by the relevant antitrust authorities, the transaction was completed at the beginning of 2019. The result was a company "with enormous clout", becoming the market leader in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and a strong presence in America and Asia. The Majorel brand was introduced in February 2019. Since then, the company focused on global expansion.

Majorel has been acquired by Teleperformance SE. The combined business strengthens service delivery in the Americas and Europe while increasing presence in Asia-Pacific and Africa.
