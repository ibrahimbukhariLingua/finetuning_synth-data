# Criterion Capital Partners



**Criterion Capital Partners LLC**, also known as simply **Criterion**, was a private equity fund based in Los Angeles, California. It was best known for being the owner of Bebo, from 2010 to 2013.


## History

Christopher Lord co-founded the company in 2002. Criterion acquired social networking service Bebo in 2010. Bebo was previously owned by AOL, who originally purchased the service for $850 million in 2008. The acquisition had failed as Bebo's business was declining. AOL sold the company for less than $10 million to Criterion. Following the acquisition, Bebo's business did not improve. In April 2012, the minority shareholders filed a $5 million suit against Criterion for â€œdestroying the site". Then in May, TechCrunch reported that Bebo filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was shutting down.
