Holding value


# Holding value



In the field of financial economics, **Holding value** is an indicator of a theoretical value of an asset that someone has in their portfolio. It is a value which sums the impacts of all the dividends that would be given to the holder in the future, to help them estimate a price to buy or sell assets.


## Expression

The following formula gives the holding value (HV) for a period beginning at i through the period n.

div = dividend

r = interest rate (of the money if it is kept at the bank; e.g., 0.02 or 2%)

i = the period at the beginning of the estimation

n = the last period considered in the window of future dividends.
