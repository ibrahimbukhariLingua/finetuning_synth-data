Active Basij members are compensated for specific projects, with reports from 2010 indicating payments of approximately $400 per day, a sum exceeding the monthly salary of a teacher at that time.


## The minimum wage in Iran

In March 2024, the Iranian government increased the basic minimum wage by 35%, setting it at 110 million rials (approximately $186) with benefits. Despite this raise, the new wage covers only about half of the estimated $400 monthly expenses required for a household of three in Tehran. Iran has been grappling with an inflation rate around 50%, and since 2018, the rial has depreciated 15-fold, reaching historic lows. Job listings in Tehran reflect these economic challenges, with positions such as supermarket workers, fast food employees, and cleaners offering monthly salaries ranging from $116 to $300 for extensive work hours, often without benefits like insurance. Some advertisements claim higher salaries, but these often come with significant conditions or are misleading upon further inquiry. This economic disparity highlights the severe financial strain on Iranian workers, who struggle to afford basic necessities despite long working hours.


## Salaries and inflation

Over the past seven years, Iran has experienced an increase in income and wealth disparities, exacerbated by rising inflation and the depreciation of the national currency. According to a report from the Statistical Center of Iran, the top 20% of the population now holds 47% of the nation's wealth, while the bottom 20% possesses a mere 0.5%. The Gini coefficient, a measure of economic inequality, has risen to 40, comparable to countries like the United States and Saudi Arabia. This growing inequality is attributed to factors such as the substantial devaluation of the rial, which has led individuals with disposable income to invest in assets like foreign currencies, gold, and real estate to preserve their wealth. Consequently, these investments have driven up prices, further widening the economic gap. Meanwhile, individuals with fixed incomes have seen their purchasing power diminish, leading to an increase in the poverty rate, with approximately 33% of Iranians now living below the poverty line.


## Salaries and poverty

As of March 2022, over 32 million Iranians—more than one-third of the population—were living below the poverty line and facing food insecurity, according to a report by the Iran Chamber of Commerce Research Center. This situation has been exacerbated by decades of double-digit inflation, which has significantly worsened since 2019, surpassing 40 percent. The report attributes the surge in inflation to U.S. economic sanctions imposed in 2018, leading to a sharp devaluation of Iran's national currency and reduced oil exports. Consequently, food poverty in Iran increased from 18 million people in 2017 to over 26 million by 2020. The study also highlights systemic issues fueling inflation, such as government inefficiency, excessive public sector spending, and reliance on printing money to cover budget deficits. Given these challenges, the report suggests that monetary and fiscal policies should focus on stabilizing inflation to stimulate production, rather than pursuing significant reductions.
