# Ann Inc.



**Ann Inc.** is an American group of specialty apparel retail chain stores for women. The company is headquartered in New York City and currently operates as a subsidiary of Ascena Retail Group. The stores offer classic-styled suits, separates, dresses, shoes and accessories. The brand is marketed under five divisions: Ann Taylor, Loft, Lou & Grey, Ann Taylor Factory, and Loft Outlet.


## History

Richard Liebeskind, the founder of Ann Taylor, opened his first Ann Taylor store in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1954. "Ann Taylor" was the name of a best-selling dress at Liebeskind's father's store. Both the best-selling dress and the name *Ann Taylor* were given by the father to his son, Richard Liebeskind, for good luck. Liebeskind decided to go with the name Ann Taylor because *Ann* was considered a very New England name, and *Taylor* evoked the image of tailored clothing. The name supposedly created the ideal identity of classic women's apparel.

In May 1991, the company completed an initial public offering resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $166.5 million.

In March 2011, the company changed its name to Ann Inc., from Ann Taylor Stores Corporation. As of October 27, 2012, the total store count was 981: of 278 Ann Taylor stores, 101 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 510 Loft stores, and 92 Loft Outlet stores, as well as online at AnnTaylor.com and Loft.com.

On May 18, 2015, Ascena Retail Group announced a $2.16 billion acquisition of Ann Inc. The buyout was completed on August 21, 2015. Ann Inc. will operate as an Ascena Retail Group subsidiary going forward.

In 2017, Ann Taylor launched a subscription rental service called Infinite Style. Loft followed up in 2019 with Infinite Loft subscription, a size inclusive subscription business.


## Divisions

**Ann Taylor** is a small US chain of clothing stores for women. Clothing is targeted for fashion forward career women. Ann Taylor was founded in 1954.

**Loft**, originally **Ann Taylor Loft**, was established in 1996 as an extension of the original Ann Taylor brand, offers more relaxed fashions for work and home, in the "moderate" priced category. The selection provided at Loft initially was a more casual replica to that of the regular Ann Taylor; however, it has developed into its own brand, and now is known as a casual lifestyle brand. Loft also offers maternity clothing.

**Lou & Grey** sells relaxed, comfortable athleisure items and active-wear inspired fashion.

**Ann Taylor Factory** offers merchandise inspired by Ann Taylor stores, but manufactured for Ann Taylor Factory.

**Loft Outlet** offers a Loft-based outlet environment, similar to the current Ann Taylor Factory stores, with unique Loft Outlet merchandise mirrored from popular and best-selling Loft products. There are currently 128 Loft Outlet stores throughout the United States.
