# La Lettre b



***La Lettre B*** is a Belgian news magazine founded in 2010.


## History

Created by Filippo Giuffrida Répaci and a group of Brussels journalists, the monthly magazine *La Lettre B* is published since 15 January 2010 by ESL Academy.

In the journal's first issue, its editor-in-chief, Lorenzo Scattini, explained the choice of *La Lettre B* as a title with the following statement: *B comme Bruxelles, B comme Business, B comme Bourse, B comme Banques... Economie – Finances – Transactions financières – Régulation. Retrouvez chaque mois dans "La lettre B" l’essentiel de l’actualité économique et financière décryptée.*

The idea behind the magazine is to highlight what is new in the Brussels EU bubble seen by independent journalists with a business approach.

After a few years of irregular publications, in 2015, *La Lettre B – New Edition* was revived due to the efforts of Filippo Giuffrida Répaci, who became its director.
Since the beginning, *La Lettre B* has published articles in English and French addressed at the European business community.
