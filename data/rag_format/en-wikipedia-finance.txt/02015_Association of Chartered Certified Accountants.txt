The **Association of Chartered Certified Accountants** (**ACCA**) is the global professional accounting body offering the Chartered Certified Accountant qualification (CCA). Founded in 1904, It is now the fourth-largest professional accounting body in the world, with 252,500 members and 526,000 student members. ACCA's headquarters are in London with principal administrative office in Glasgow. ACCA works through a network of over 110 offices and centres in 51 countries - with 346 Approved Learning Partners (ALP) and more than 7,600 Approved Employers worldwide, who provide employee development.

The term 'Chartered' in ACCA qualification refers to the Royal Charter granted in 1974.

'Chartered Certified Accountant' is a legally protected term. Individuals who describe themselves as Chartered Certified Accountants must be members of ACCA and if they carry out public practice engagements, must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, carrying liability insurance and submitting to inspections.

ACCA works in the public interest, ensuring that its members are appropriately regulated. It promotes principles-based regulation. ACCA actively seeks to enhance the value of accounting in society through international research. It takes progressive stances on global issues to ensure accountancy as a profession continues to grow in reputation and influence.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## History

ACCA traces its origin to 1904, when eight people formed the London Association of Accountants to allow more open access to the profession than was available through the accounting bodies at the time, notably the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS). As of 2020, the vision of ACCA is to develop the accountancy profession the world needs.

Key dates in ACCA history include:

* **1909:** Ethel Ayres Purdie is elected as the first female associate member of an accounting professional body.

## Qualifications

The term *Chartered Certified Accountant* was introduced in 1996. Prior to that date, ACCA members were known as *Certified Accountant.* It is still permissible for an ACCA member to use this term. Members of ACCA with post-qualification experience of more than five years and have completed the required continued professional development are designated Fellows, and use the designatory letters FCCA in place of ACCA.

The term *Chartered* refers to the Royal Charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

Chartered Certified Accountants work in all fields of business and finance. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.

Since *Chartered Certified Accountant* is a legally protected term,ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ individuals who describe themselves as such must be members of ACCA. If they carry out public practice engagements, they must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, being insured against any possible liability claims and submitting to inspections.

ACCA offers the following certifications:


### Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA)

Chartered Certified Accountant is the professional body's main qualification. Following completion of up to 13 professional examinations, three years of supervised, relevant accounting experience and an ethics module, it enables an individual to become a Chartered Certified Accountant. The ACCA professional examinations are offered worldwide four times yearly in March, June, September and December as paper-based and computer-based exams. On-demand computer-based exams (CBE) are also offered for the first four exams (BT, MA, FA, LW), and Session CBEs for the rest (PM, TX, FR, AA, FM) which are available to be taken at ACCA licensed exam centres. A Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Applied Accounting (after completing the Fundamentals level of the exams, the Ethics and Professional Skills module and submitting a Research and Analysis project), is offered in association with Oxford Brookes University.

From September 2018 onward, the syllabus comprises 13 examinations and an Ethics and Professional Skills module (EPSM), although some exemptions are available. In April 2019, a Data Analytics unit was added in EPSM .

The qualification is structured in three modules, plus an **Ethics and Professional Skills module** and a **Professional Experience Requirement (PER)**.

The Applied Knowledge level consists of 3 examinations:

* BT - Business and Technology
* MA - Management Accounting
* FA - Financial Accounting

The Applied Skills level consists of 6 examinations:

* LW - Corporate and Business Law
* PM - Performance Management
* TX - Taxation
* FR - Financial Reporting
* AA - Audit and Assurance
* FM - Financial Management

The Strategic Professional level involves 4 examinations: 2 from Essential and any 2 from Options.

Essential (or Compulsory):

* SBL - Strategic Business Leader
* SBR - Strategic Business Reporting

Options:

* AFM - Advanced Financial Management
* APM - Advanced Performance Management
* ATX - Advanced Taxation
* AAA - Advanced Audit and Assurance

The ACCA full Professional qualification is regarded as the equivalent of a UK master's degree by the UK NARIC and Department for Education.

Subjects include: Financial accounting, Management accounting, Financial reporting, Taxation, Company law, Audit and assurance and Financial management.


### Foundation-level qualifications – Foundations in Accountancy (FIA)

ACCA offers a range of foundation-level certificates and diplomas – collectively referred to as Foundations in Accountancy (FIA) – which provide an entry point for anyone new to accounting and finance and who doesn't meet the minimum entry requirements for the ACCA Qualification (which is three GCSEs and 2 A Levels or equivalent, in five separate subjects). Students can start at any level within the Foundation level, but it is recommended that students without any formal academic qualifications start with the **Introductory Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting** and complete exams **Recording Financial Transactions (FA1)** and **Management Information (MA1)**; then progress to the **Intermediate Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting** and complete exams **Maintaining Financial Records (FA2)** and **Managing Costs and Finance (MA2)**; before progressing to the **Diploma in Accounting and Business** and completing **Business and Technology (FBT)**, **Management Accounting (FMA)** and **Financial Accounting (FFA)**. Students can use the Foundation-level awards as an entry route onto the ACCA Qualification. Students who complete the Diploma in Accounting and Business will be given exemption from the first three exams of the ACCA Qualification (BT, MA and FA) and can start their studies on the ACCA Qualification with Corporate and Business Law (LW).

In order to achieve a certificate for the exams completed students must also complete a foundation ethics module called **Foundations in Professionalism**, but this only has to be completed once, even if a student wishes to achieve both certificates and the diploma.

The Foundation-level exams are available as paper-based exams held in March, June, September and December or as on-demand computer-based exams throughout the year at ACCA licensed exam centres.


### Other qualifications

The ACCA also offers certain other qualifications:

* BSc (Hons) in Applied Accounting, offered in association with Oxford Brookes University. However, Oxford Brookes Business School will not offer the BSc Applied Accounting after May 2026.
* MSc in Professional Accountancy, offered in association with the University of London.
* Global MBA (for full ACCA members), offered in association with Oxford Brookes University.
* Certificate in International Financial Reporting (Cert IFR), offered both in English and Spanish.
* Diploma in International Financial Reporting (DipIFR), offered both in English and Russian.
* Certificate in International Auditing (Cert IA), offered both in English and Spanish.
* Certificate in International Public Sector Accounting Standards (Cert IPSAS), offered both in English and Arabic.
* Certificate in Business Valuations in partnership with the French Chartered Accountants Institute (CSOEC), offered both in English and French.
* Diploma in Financial Management (DipFM). This certification was previously known as the *Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance (CDipAF)*, a financial qualification designed for managers outside of finance. This qualification was replaced with Foundations in Accountancy awards at the end of 2011.

## Disciplinary proceedings

ACCA students, affiliates and members are bound by ACCA rules and regulations. ACCA is able to take disciplinary action (such as revoking ACCA qualification or exacting a fine) against them if they breach ACCA rules. ACCA rules and regulations are governed by English and Welsh law and ACCA disciplinary decisions can only be challenged in England and Wales.


## ACCA-X online courses

Launched in early 2015, ACCA-X are online courses for students starting their studies in accountancy and business. These courses are available for the first seven Foundations level exams and hosted on edX, with content developed by Epigeum.

In April 2016, ACCA-X won the Best eLearning and Online Education Award at the International and European Association Awards held in Berlin, Germany.


### Free courses

The following courses are free and available to anyone in the world:

* Introduction to Financial and Management Accounting (preparation for FA1 and MA1)
* Intermediate Financial and Management Accounting (preparation for FA2 and MA2)

### Paid courses

These courses are available in all but three countries:

* Business and Technology (preparation for BT/FBT)
* Management Accounting (preparation for MA/FMA)
* Financial Management (preparation for FA/FFA)

Exams passed in these three modules and the completion of 'Foundations in Professionalism' module will lead to the **Diploma in Accounting and Business**.


## Memberships


### Affiliate

Candidates register as student members to undertake the professional qualification.

Upon successful completion of the examinations, student members transfer to Affiliate status.

"For ACCA affiliates to gain admission to full membership, they must demonstrate, on the application form, that they have obtained a minimum of three years of acceptable, supervised, practical experience in an accountancy role (or roles) and have reached the required standard of competence."


### Fellowship

From 2008, Fellowship, or senior membership of ACCA, is awarded automatically based on 5 years' continuous membership, subject to compliance with Continuing Professional Development requirements. This practice is different to many other accounting bodies whose members may attain senior memberships only after demonstrating outstanding achievement or contribution made to the accounting profession or at large.

Fellow members of ACCA use the designatory letters *FCCA* in place of *ACCA.*


### Continuing Professional Development

Before 2005, Continuing Professional Development (CPD) was mandatory only for holders of 'Practicing Certificate' and 'Insolvency Licence'. From 2005 to 2007, ACCA phased in mandatory CPD requirements for all members.


## Legal and mutual recognition


### Europe


#### United Kingdom and Ireland

The ACCA or Chartered Certified Accountant qualification is fully recognised in both the United Kingdom and Ireland.

* Under its Charter, ACCA works in the public interest.
* It is a Designated Professional Body under the Financial Services and Markets Act, business activities.
* It is a *Recognised Professional Body* under the Insolvency Act to issue permits to individual *Chartered Certified Accountants* to conduct insolvency appointments.
* It is also a *Recognised Qualifying Body* and *Recognised Supervisory Body* in relation to company auditing under the Companies Act of 1989.
* ACCA is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB). Members of these bodies are deemed to hold equivalent-level qualifications and advertisements for jobs often state that an organisation is looking for a CCAB-qualified individual.
* Full members of CCAB organisations including ACCA could apply for ICAEW membership subject to certain criteria.
* Only ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS, Association of International Accountants (AIA) and Chartered Accountants Ireland (CA Ireland) are able to authorise members to conduct audit, insolvency and investment business work in both the United Kingdom and Ireland.
* Outside these countries, legal recognition by government authorities and mutual recognition by equivalent overseas institutes, varies. Where full legal or mutual recognition is not available, ACCA members can sometimes obtain *advanced standing* in terms of sitting local accountancy examinations. ACCA's strong global reputation may make it unnecessary to acquire a local designation.
* Similarly, many universities and educational providers recognise ACCA as equivalent to at least a Bachelor's degree in accountancy, for the purpose of obtaining credit towards a local master's degree or an advanced study program.

The Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) assigned ACCA Qualification to 'Level 8' of the Irish National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) in 2018. Level 8 holds Irish postgraduate qualifications, such as postgraduate diplomas and master's degrees.

In 2011, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC; then Professional Oversight Board) published information for the first time about its concerns over self-regulation by particular institutes. Press reports highlighted comments about ACCA, which had implemented recommendations to improve its examination syllabus, but needed to pay greater attention to monitoring long-time members. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 the ACCA professional body had the highest percentage of A&B (best) outcomes from FRC's Recognised Supervisory Body (RSB) visits to a sample of 'Registered UK Audit Firms'. ACCA firms tend to audit smaller and less complex clients.

As of 2023 there were over 113,000 members and 72,000 students in the UK & Ireland.


#### European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) & Switzerland

The ACCA qualification is legally recognized by all member countries of the European Union under the Mutual Recognition Directive. This recognition extends to the European Economic Area nations and Switzerland. For example, a holder of the ACCA could practice as an accountant in all member countries of the European Union, European Economic Area and Switzerland, describing himself/herself as *ACCA* or *Chartered Certified Accountant*. Access to local professional qualifications requires a separate test.

At the end of 2016 there were over 16,000 members and almost 60,000 students in Europe (excluding the UK & Ireland).


#### Turkey

ACCA and the Union of Chambers of Certified Public Accountants of Turkey (TÜRMOB) signed a partnership agreement in 2004 which enables TÜRMOB members resident in Turkey to follow the ACCA Strategic Professional level and achieve ACCA membership.


### North America


#### United States

* In June 2012, ACCA and Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) announced a strategic partnership. The two bodies joined forces to empower accountants and financial professionals to drive business performance. In January 2013, the ICMA Board of Regents, representing the certification division of IMA, voted to waive its usual bachelor's degree requirement for ACCA members wishing to earn IMA's Certified Management Accountant (CMA) credential. The bachelor's degree waiver will allow all ACCA members around the world, regardless of background, access to IMA's CMA credential. This is a benefit to ACCA members who wish to have a US-based credential.
* There is no mutual recognition between ACCA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)/National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA).

At the end of 2016 there were 2,015 members in the US.


#### Canada

ACCA announced a Mutual Recognition Agreement with Certified General Accountant (CGA Canada) effective from 1 January 2007; renewed in 2011 for a further 5 years period until December 2017. As of 2006ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), World Education Services and the Odette School of Business at the University of Windsor indicated that the evaluation recognized ACCA as having the Canadian equivalence of a bachelor's degree (four years) in Accounting. The Canadian branch of ACCA is pursuing recognition for statutory audit purposes in the province of Ontario under the province's *Public Accounting Act of 2004.*

Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and Certified Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) announced a joint qualification 'Chartered Professional Accountant or CPA Designation', but whether this designation will impinge on ACCA's application for recognition in Ontario is uncertain.

On 29 November 2012 the ACCA opened up legal proceedings against the CICA to operate in Canada, complicated by the merger of the accounting profession in Canada, incorporating CICA, CMA Canada and CGA to use 'Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA)'. A 10-year transitional period requires all CPA members to use CPA, 'legacy designation' rather than the newer designation. The merger completed in 2015.

At the end of 2016 there were 3,011 members in Canada.

As of 2024, there were over 5,000 members and 2,000 students.
