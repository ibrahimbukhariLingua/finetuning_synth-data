## History


### Origins

The origins of **Brilliance Auto Group** (officially **Huachen Automotive Group Holdings Company Limited**) can be traced to a Chinese government-owned automobile factory which under founding chairman Yang Rong, became one of the leading Chinese makers of minibuses between 1991 and 2002.


### 1990s

Brilliance rose in the 1990s under Yang Rong to become China’s largest automaker.

On 9 June 1992, a subsidiary, **Brilliance China Automotive Holding Limited** was incorporated in Bermuda. In the same year, the company was registered as a foreign company in the Hong Kong Companies Registry. Initially, the subsidiary owned 40% stake of Shenyang Jinbei Coach Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Chinese: 沈阳金杯客车制造有限公司), while the rest of the stake was owned by another company, Shenyang Jinbei Automotive Company Limited (Chinese: 金杯汽车股份有限公司; SSE: 600609). The ratio was later changed to 51% owned by Brilliance China Auto and 49% owned by Shenyang Jinbei Automotive.²⁴⁴ The American depositary shares of Brilliance China Auto were floated on the New York Stock Exchange beginning in 1992 as NYSE:CBA. The company intended to delist from NYSE in 2007 and completed in 2009.

In 1999, the Group injected most of the group assets into the subsidiary, and the shares began to be traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (now part of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing) as SEHK:1114. As of 31 December 2019ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, Huachen Automotive Group (Brilliance Auto Group) owned 42.32% shares of the listed company as the largest and controlling shareholder.

The Group has another listed associate company that is listing in the Shanghai Stock Exchange: Shenyang Jinbei Automotive Company Limited. As of 31 December 2019ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the Brilliance Auto Group, via an intermediate company Shenyang Automobile Industry Asset Management Company Limited (Chinese: 沈阳市汽车工业资产经营有限公司), owned 24.38% of the shares of that company as the largest and controlling shareholder. It planned to inject the stake into the major listed company of the group, Brilliance Auto, in 2003. However, the deal collapsed. Nevertheless, Shenyang Jinbei Automotive has not had the controlling interest of Shenyang Jinbei Coach Manufacturing since 1992, which is the predecessor of Brilliance Jinbei (now Renault Brilliance Jinbei).

Shenyang Jinbei Automotive was listed on the stock exchange since 1992. Shenyang Jinbei Automotive and Brilliance Auto Group were separate conglomerates, which the controlling stake of Shenyang Jinbei Automotive was acquired by FAW Group in 1995.²⁴⁶ Shenyang Automobile Industry AMC agreed to acquire a 29.91% stake from FAW Group in 2000.


### 2000s

In 2001, Shenhua Holdings agreed to acquire the shares of Shenyang Jinbei Automotive that were held by Shenyang Automobile Industry AMC,²⁴⁸ allowing the Jinbei marque integrated into the Group. However, the deal revised into Brilliance Auto agreed to acquire the stake from Shenyang Automobile Industry AMC in 2003.²⁵⁰–²⁵¹ Despite the final deal became Brilliance Auto Group acquired Shenyang Automobile Industry AMC directly in April 2018 from the Shenyang Municipal People's Government, which in turn has the full control of the stake of Shenyang Jinbei Automotive that was held by the AMC.

In 2001, *Forbes* reported that Chairman Yang Rong was China's third-richest businessman. Yang made a failed bid to locate a Brilliance factory in Ningbo, China. Ningbo is near the rich coastal city of Shanghai. In his attempt Yang incurred the wrath of the governor of the province of Liaoning, Bo Xilai (Bo was later convicted on bribery, corruption, abuse of power, and embezzlement, and sentenced to life imprisonment), as Bo demanded that Yang locate the factory in Liaoning, and Yang refused. In 2002, Bo seized Yang's stake of $700 million in Brilliance.> Bo also accused Yang of embezzlement, and had an arrest warrant issued against him, precipitating Yang's flight from China in July 2002; since then Yang has been living in exile in the United States.

In 2003, BMW and Brilliance Auto signed a deal for the production of BMW-branded sedans in China.

In 2005, Brilliance planned an entry into the newly formed FIA World Touring Car Championship. However, the Brilliance WTCC program did not make the grid.

From 2009 to 2011, the group was the eighth-largest automaker in China.


### 2010s to present

In 2012, Brilliance Auto Group formed a joint venture **Brilliance Shineray** (Chinese: 华晨鑫源) in Chongqing with Shineray Group to produce SWM and Jinbei brand automobiles. As of 2019, Shineray Group owned 80% stake of that joint venture. The rest is owned by 沈阳华益新汽车销售有限公司. The latter is not part of the Brilliance Auto Group, but the Group provides a guarantee for some debt of that company.

In 2013, Brilliance Auto formed a spin-off, Xinchen China Power Holdings Limited.

In 2017, Brilliance Auto also formed another joint venture Renault Brilliance Jinbei with Renault. Brilliance Auto acquired the remaining 39.1% stake of Brilliance Jinbei from sister company Shenyang Jinbei Automotive, and then Brilliance Auto re-sold a 49% stake to Renault.

In October 2018, BMW Brilliance, a 50:50 joint venture between BMW and Brilliance, was taken over by BMW by acquiring an additional 25% of available shares.

In recent years, Brilliance Group has suffered from long-term poor management and its own brands have been in a state of loss. The main profit comes from BMW Brilliance, and the debt ratio remains high. In 2019, Brilliance Auto's net profit was RMB 7.626 billion. If the financial data of BMW Brilliance were removed, it would be a loss of RMB 1.334 billion. In the first half of 2020, Brilliance Auto's net profit was RMB 4.045 billion, of which BMW Brilliance contributed RMB 4.338 billion. Two credit rating agencies in mainland China, Dagong International and Oriental Jincheng, began to put Brilliance bonds on their watch list in late August 2020. By late September, Brilliance's credit rating began to be downgraded. By late October, Brilliance's credit rating had been reduced from AAA to A+.

In November 2020, Brilliance Auto's parent went into bankruptcy administration, and announced the default of corporate bonds worth more than CNY6.5 billion. The bankruptcy administration is not affecting subsidiaries Brilliance Auto, Xinchen China Power, Shenhua Holdings, Shenyang Jinbei Automotive, or any of the joint ventures operated by the organization.

On January 12, 2021, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a disciplinary decision to publicly condemn Brilliance Automotive Group Holding Co., Ltd. and its chairman and person in charge of information disclosure affairs.

On December 30, 2021, Brilliance Renault Jinbei Automobile Co., Ltd. filed a new bankruptcy review case, and the handling court was the Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court of Liaoning Province.

In June 2023, Brilliance Group stated that it had identified Shenyang Automobile Co., Ltd. as a potential investor in the reorganization. Shenyang Automobile is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shenyang Cairui Investment Co., Ltd. Caisheng Investment, a subsidiary of Shenyang Cairui Shengjing Financial Holdings, and Shenyang Metro Operation, a subsidiary of Shenyang Metro, each hold 50% of the shares. The actual controller is Shenyang State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. After the relevant procedures for reorganization are passed, the actual controller of Brilliance Auto will be changed from the Liaoning Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission to the Shenyang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission.

On September 15, 2023, FAW Car Vice President Liu Xuemin and former Vice President Liu Tongfu were suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and were both subject to disciplinary review and supervision investigation by the Liaoning Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision.

Key models include:


## Operations

BMW-branded autos are made at a production base in the Northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang completed in 2004, and ongoing construction saw this base increase its production capacity to 200,000 units/year by 2012.

An engine-making production base is located in Mianyang, Sichuan province.


## Sales

A total of 188,143 Brilliance marque vehicles were sold in China in 2013, making it the 25th largest-selling car brand in the country in that year (and the 10th largest-selling Chinese brand).


### European exports

In 2007, Brilliance's BS6 sedan performed poorly in a crash test conducted by Germany's ADAC, receiving only one out of five possible stars in the Euro NCAP rating. Brilliance then redesigned the car, changing at least sixty components, and it saw a three-star performance in a crash test performed by Spain's Idiada. However, the price also rose considerably, and the importer (HSO Motors) went bankrupt in November 2009. Brilliance then tried to go it alone, but with high pricing and considerable market reluctance after the well-publicized crash test failures, exports to Europe were ended in April 2010 with no immediate plans for resumption.


### SAIPA

In 2015, Brilliance announced it had started joint production with SAIPA of Iran, to produce the H300 and H200 models, under the local brand name of Saipa.
