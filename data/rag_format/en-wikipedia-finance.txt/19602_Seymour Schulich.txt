# Seymour Schulich



**Seymour Schulich** OC (/ˈʃuːlɪk/ SHOO-lik; born January 6, 1940) is a Canadian businessman, investor, author, and philanthropist.


## Biography

Schulich was raised in a Jewish family in Montreal, Quebec. He graduated from McGill University with a BSc in 1961 and an MBA from the Desautels Faculty of Management in 1965. He earned the Chartered Financial Analyst designation from the University of Virginia in 1969.

Schulich is married to Tanna and they live in Willowdale, a neighbourhood of Toronto. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.


## Career

Schulich's first job was at Shell. From 1968 to 1990, he worked at Beutel, Goodman & Company, an asset management company which manages in excess of $43 billion CAD (as of 2023), becoming president and vice-chairman.

In 1978, Schulich, along with partner Pierre Lassonde, helped pioneer the concept of royalty payments in the mining industry: their Franco-Nevada and Euro-Nevada companies discovered some precious minerals, but their royalty arrangements allowed them to gain ownership stakes in some of the world's most profitable mines. A $1,000 investment in Franco-Nevada's stock in 1983 was worth $1.2 million in 2002, equivalent to a 40% average annual rate of return. In 2002, Franco-Nevada merged with Normandy Mining of Australia and Newmont, creating the largest gold mining company in the world, Newmont. Schulich was Director of Newmont Mining and Chairman of its merchant banking division from 2002-2007.

In 2007, Schulich published a book titled *Get Smarter: Life and Business Lessons*.


## Philanthropy

Schulich has donated funds to numerous Canadian universities including York (Schulich School of Business), Western Ontario (Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry), Calgary (Schulich School of Engineering), Dalhousie (Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie Faculty of Computer Science), McGill (Schulich School of Music), Nipissing (Schulich School of Education), and Queen's (Schulich-Woolf Rare Book Collection). The first and largest donation that was made was to the Schulich School of Business at York University. All degrees issued by the Schulich School of Business now bear the signature of Seymour Schulich. His philanthropy also extends beyond universities, to the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Schulich Heart Centre) in Toronto, and outside Canada to the University of Nevada, Reno (Schulich Lecture Hall) and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology.

On October 15, 2009, Schulich officially presented a donation in the amount of $20 million to Dalhousie University's Law School; in doing so, the Law School has now been renamed the Schulich School of Law.

On October 14, 2011, Schulich announced a $100 million scholarship program targeting students entering the science, technology, engineering and math fields (STEM) in Canada and Israel. This gift is being co-administered by UJA Federation of Greater Toronto and the Schulich Foundation. The program is called *Schulich Leader Scholarships*, the largest undergraduate STEM scholarship opportunity in each country.
