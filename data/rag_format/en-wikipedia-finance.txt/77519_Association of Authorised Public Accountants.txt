Association of Authorised Public Accountants


# Association of Authorised Public Accountants



The **Association of Authorised Public Accountants** (**AAPA**) is a British professional body for public accountants.

The AAPA was formed in 1978 as a professional body for auditors recognised individually under the Companies Act 1948. AAPA achieved formal recognition by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1989 when the Companies Act received Royal Assent. In September 1991, AAPA achieved the status of a *Recognised Supervisory Body* and eligible AAPA members have since been entitled to use the designation *Registered Auditor*.

AAPA is not an examining body: all of its members have been admitted either because they have individual audit authorisation or because they have obtained a qualification from another body which is recognised for audit purposes in the UK.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 24 June 1996, members of AAPA voted for the body to become a subsidiary company of the **Association of Chartered Certified Accountants** (**ACCA**). AAPA is, therefore, a company limited by guarantee and registered in England. While maintaining its own separate and distinctive identity constitutionally, AAPA now benefits from a wide range of authorisation and support facilities through the ACCA.
