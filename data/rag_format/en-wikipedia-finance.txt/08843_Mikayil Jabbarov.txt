## Controversies

2013–2017 – Comprehensive measures were taken to prevent bribery and corruption in the educational system, but they were not assessed as fully successful. Experts called for more radical measures to be taken, no real proposals were put forward though.

2016 – The idea that "it is not right to assess the students studying within a new educational system through the tests" was met with criticism. This idea was misrepresented to the public as a suggestion to cancel the test exams, while, in fact, the idea implied application of new tools to assess students’ knowledge. With this regard, the State Examination Center released a statement with a similar message, confirming that the new idea does not mean a cancellation of the tests as such.
