WalletHub


# WalletHub



**WalletHub** (formerly CardHub.com) is a personal finance company that launched in August 2013. It is based in Miami and owned by Evolution Finance, Inc.

WalletHub offers free consumer tools, such as its WalletLiteracy Quiz and its Financial Fitness Tool, which provides users with credit reports, scores and monitoring. WalletHub has tools for comparing credit cards, personal loans, car insurance and bank accounts.


## History

WalletHub initially positioned itself as a "personal finance social network" with a focus on reviews for financial advisors,Â and later expanded to add financial management tools.

In February 2015, Major League Baseball filed a trademark dispute claiming that WalletHub's logo resembled the logos of the Washington Nationals and the Chicago Cubs too closely. Major League Baseball ended the dispute in August 2015 after WalletHub amended its trademark registration to explicitly exclude baseball and softball from the trademark's scope.


## Products and services

WalletHub provides financial product comparison tools for credit cards, car insurance, and bank accounts. The company has produced a wide range of research reports, including a quarterly credit card debt report and reports comparing cities and states in financially relevant categories. WalletHub also offers free credit scores, reports, and monitoring through a partnership with TransUnion.
