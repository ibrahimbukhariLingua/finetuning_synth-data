## History

Established as an Equatorial Finance Company in 1983, Due to change in regulation, Equatorial Finance Company was converted to Equatorial Commercial Bank Limited and commenced operations as a fully-fledged commercial bank in June 1995.

In June 2010 Equatorial Commercial Bank merged with Southern Credit Banking Corporation, creating a new enlarged bank under the Equatorial Commercial Bank brand. The Merger was aimed at enabling the banks meet the Central Bank of Kenya requirement for commercial banks shore up their core capital to at least KSh.1 billion/= (approximately US$12 million).

The Equatorial Commercial Bank - Southern Credit Banking Corporation merger transaction was structured in the following four interlinked phases:

1. ECB implemented a KSh.264 million/= (approximately US$3.1million) rights issue to increase its authorised and issued share capital in order to meet the capital adequacy requirements of the merged bank.
2. By way of a share swap agreement, ECB acquired the full shareholding in SCBC, in exchange for its own shares thereby making SCBC a wholly owned subsidiary of ECB. SCBC shareholders received 11.25% of the issued share capital of ECB.
3. ECB (now the parent company) and SCBC (the subsidiary) then executed an asset and portfolio (business) agreement to transfer all of ECB's banking business, assets and liabilities to SCBC who paid a fair consideration through the creation of new shares.
4. SCBC (the subsidiary) adopted the name **Equatorial Commercial Bank Limited** and retained the joint banking business while the former ECB (the parent) returned its banking licence to the Central Bank of Kenya for cancellation and changed its name to **Equatorial Holding Limited** to become a non-operating holding company of the merged bank. All future subsidiaries and associate companies would be held by Equatorial Holding Limited.

The merger transaction consideration was entirely satisfied by the issue of shares and there was no cash transaction.

In September 2014, Mwalimu Cooperative Savings & Credit Society Limited, Kenya's largest Sacco by assets, made a bid to acquire 51% shareholding in Equatorial Commercial Bank in a deal valued at KSh.1.7 billion/= (approximately US$18 million). This move was in line with the strategic objective of the society of expanding business opportunities. The acquisition, was to enable the Sacco to collect deposits from beyond its membership, access funds at lower rates, venture into trade finance and offer its members ATM services. The deal was concluded at the end of 2014 and in 2015, the Sacco acquired another 24 percent shareholding, bringing its ownership to 75 percent.

In July 2016, the bank was rebranded to Spire Bank.
