After obtaining a Dr. rer. pol. in economics from the University of Siegen, Germany in 1987, Weber pursued his scientific studies abroad at the University of London and Tilburg University. Between 1992 and 1993, Weber spent an academic year in Washington, D.C. while teaching. In 1994, Weber received his habilitation in Economics from the University of Siegen. He also holds honorary doctorates from the University of Duisburg-Essen and the University of Konstanz.


## Career

From 1982 to 1988 Weber worked as research assistant in the field of monetary economics at the University of Siegen and was awarded a Doctorate in 1987. After gaining his *habilitation* at the University Siegen in 1994, he was appointed Professor of Economic Theory at the University of Bonn, and moved to the Goethe University Frankfurt in 1998. He was also the Director of the Center for Financial Studies in Frankfurt am Main from 1998 to 2001 and of the Center for Financial Research at the University of Cologne from 2001 to 2004.

In 2001 Weber was appointed Professor of International Economics at the University of Cologne, and from 2002 to 2004 he was a Member of the German Council of Economic Experts. From 2002 until 2011 he was a member of the expert advisory panel to the Deutsche Bundesbank.


### Bundesbank

Weber was appointed President of the Deutsche Bundesbank by the German finance minister Hans Eichel as successor of the resigning Ernst Welteke, and elected as a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank in 2004.

In this capacity, Weber also served on the Board of Directors for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as German governor of the International Monetary Fund and a member of the G7 and G20 Ministers and Governors during this time.

On 9 February 2011, Weber announced his resignation from his chairmanship of the Bundesbank, effective 30 April 2011, a year before the expiry of his term of office.
