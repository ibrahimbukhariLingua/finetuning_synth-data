### Fort Knox

This property includes a mill, tailings storage, heap leach facility, the Gil project, and the True North open pit mine, which is closed and under monitoring. Expected to run out of ore in 2021, the mine's life has been extended to 2030 following a $100 million expansion investment announced in 2018, increasing life-of-mine production by about 1.5 million gold equivalent ounces.


### Round Mountain

The Round Mountain Gold Mine is located in Nye County, Nevada and has operated by Kinross since 2003. They purchased the remaining outstanding interest in the company from Barrick Gold in 2016.


### Bald Mountain

Located in White Pine County, Nevada, the Bald Mountain mine is operated by subsidiary KG Mining (Bald Mountain) Inc.


### Paracatu

The open-pit Paracatu gold mine, located in northwest Minas Gerais, Brazil.


### Tasiast

Kinross acquired the Tasiast mine (located in Mauritania) in 2010, expanding the operation twice by 2017.

In 2012, securities class action lawsuits launched in the U.S. and Canada, alleging Kinross Gold overstated the value of Tasiast mine in its financial statements, misrepresented some of the mine's project expansion schedules, and made other false statements. In 2015, the parties reached no-fault settlement agreements which included payments by Kinross totaling approximately $US 40 million.

In June 2016, due to "government allegations of invalid work permits" for expatriate employees, the mine suspended operations, resuming them in August that same year.

In May 2020, there was a short strike by unionized employees at the mine, which was suspended at the request of the Mauritanian government. A month later, Kinross reached an agreement in principle with the government, which included revalued royalties.


### Chirano

Kinross holds 90% ownership of the Chirano gold mine, with the remainder held by the Government of Ghana. In April 2022, Kinross announced plans to sell its 90% ownership for US$225-million to Asante Gold Corp.


## History


### Founding and early years

Kinross Gold Corporation was founded in 1993, following the amalgamation of three companies: Plexus Resources Corporation, CMP Resources and numbered company 1021105 Ontario Corp., resulting in the new company owning a stake and royalties in a mining property in Fallon, Nevada and the QR Mine in British Columbia. On June 1, 1993, Kinross was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, then on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994.

Kinross' first project – now operated by its subsidiary Fairbanks Gold Mining – was the Fort Knox Gold Mine, an open-pit mining operation in Alaska. The area, including surrounding deposits, was prospected as early as 1913, but no mining took place until 1996. The mine currently produces over 200,000 ounces of gold a year.

In 1998, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kinross merged with Amax Gold, forming Kinam Gold, the company's largest subsidiary. effectively transferring ownership of the mine back to Kinross, along with Maricunga Gold Mine in Chile, as part of the merger.


### 1999–2006

Kinross acquired Hollinger Mines in 1999 as part of a land package prior to the bankruptcy of Royal Oak Mines (later sold to Goldcorp in 2006). Also that year, Kinross acquired LA Teko Resources Ltd. through its wholly owned subsidiary, LT Acquisition Inc. division.

In July 2002, Kinross and Placer Dome combined their assets in Timmins, Ontario and formed the Porcupine Joint Venture (51% Placer Dome, 49% Kinross). In January 2003 Kinross TVX Gold and Echo Bay Mines shareholders approved a $3-billion merger, combining the three companies, while retaining the name Kinross Gold. The TVX merger resulted in Kinross' stake in the La Coipa open pit mine, the remainder being purchased from Goldcorp in 2007.

In 2006, Kinross bought Crown Resources Corporation, which gave it ownership of the mineral resource Buckhorn Mountain (later Buckhorn Gold Mine) and the associated mineral processing facilities.


### 2007–present

In 2007, Kinross traded assets with Goldcorp; Kinross received $200 million and the remaining portion of the La Coipa Gold Mine it had acquired with the TVX merger, in exchange for giving up its 49% of the Porcupine Joint Venture and 31.9% of the Musselwhite mine.

In 2010, Kinross purchased 91% of Red Back Mining for $7.1 billion. The purchase brought with it the two gold mines in Africa (Chirano and Tasiast). Also that year, Kinross acquired the Dvoinoye deposit and the property in Vodorazdelnaya, about 90 kilometres (56 mi) north of Kinross’ Kupol operation. In 2011, Kinross entered into a share purchase agreement with the State Unitary Enterprise of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, whereby it held 100% of the Kupol mine and exploration licenses. Kinross sold its interest in the Crixás mine to AngloGold Ashanti in 2012.

In December 2017, Kinross acquired mineral rights to Gilmore, or Parcel G, a 709-acre tract adjacent to its Fort Knox Gold Mine, about 25 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska. Estimates of the land valued it as containing 2.1 million ounces of gold.

In December 2021, Kinross offered to acquire Great Bear Resources for $29 per share, or about $1.8 billion, giving it ownership of a gold mining prospect in Red Lake, Ontario, Canada. Kinross shares dropped 9% after it announced the buyout bid. The deal to acquire Great Bear closed on February 24, 2022.
