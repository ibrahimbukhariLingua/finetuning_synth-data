# Collaborative Fund



**Collaborative Fund** is a venture capital firm that provides seed and early stage funding to consumer industry and climate technology companies.


## Firm

Founded in 2010 by Craig Shapiro, the firm is based in New York City, New York, with approximately $1B of assets under management. The firm closed its fourth flagship fund for $100 million in 2018. In 2022, it launched the Shared Future Fund, which invests in climate technology. The firm raised its sixth flagship fund, valued at $125 million, in 2024, completing the process in 90 days.

With around 25 full-time employees, the firm is active in the food, healthcare, climate technology, and consumer industries. Since its founding, it has invested in over 300 companies and achieved nearly 60 successful exits, including Kickstarter, Lyft, Blue Bottle Coffee, and Reddit. The firm has helped fuel the growth of over 24 unicorns and IPOs.

Notable investments include Sweetgreen, Beyond Meat, and Scopely, which was acquired by Savvy Games Group for $4.9 billion. The firm's approach focuses on backing companies that are "doing good" while achieving returns, with early investments often yielding exponential growth â€“ for instance, investments under $10 million in companies like The Farmer's Dog have grown to billions.
