## History

They were published independently from October 1983 thru August 1992 by Ziff-Davis. At that point, they were acquired and merged with *Digital News*; the new title was *Digital News & Review*. The Boston Globe had described the situation between the prior publication owners as "The war among the Digitals: Bitter competition reflects growing rivalry between *Ziff*, *McGovern* empires." The combined *Digital News & Review* periodical was printed from 1992 to 1996 by Reed Business Information. That title ceased publishing "due to the lack of an advertising base."
