Portside Tower


# Portside Tower



**Portside** is a 139-metre-tall (456 ft) building in Cape Town, South Africa. Completed in 2014, it is the city's tallest building and, at the time of completion, was Cape Town's first significant skyscraper developed in the central business district (CBD) in 15 years.

The property is jointly owned by FirstRand Bank (FNB, RMB, Wesbank and Ashburton) and Accelerate Property Fund (APF). The bank self-occupies its share of the property, while AcPF leases office and retail space to tenants. AcPF appointed the Cape Town commercial brokerage firm Baker Street Properties to manage and market the property.

The Green Building Council of South Africa (GBCSA) awarded the property a 5 star Green Star rating, making it the tallest Green Building in South Africa.


## Conception

In 2008, it was initially proposed that the building would include a hotel and be 147.6 metres (484 ft) above sea level. However, due to the late-2000s recession and difficulties in securing a hotel management contact, the project was put on hold for almost three years and the design was altered.

During the design and planning phase, and after extensive public participation, it was decided to keep the building below a certain height so as not to obscure the view of Table Mountain. The 32-storey tower has over 51,500 square metres (554,000 sq ft) of office space with remaining space being used for over 1,382 parking bays and retail outlets.

The building was designed to use low energy technology throughout and is the first large building in South Africa to use almost exclusively LED lighting. The building has been awarded a five star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of South Africa as compliant technologies have been specified throughout.

The South African architecture studio dhk Architects; Louis Karol Architects designed the building.


## Construction

Construction work on the tower began on 12 August 2011. In late March 2013, construction was temporarily halted by the City of Cape Town's disaster response unit due to strong gale-force winds making the scaffolding unstable.
