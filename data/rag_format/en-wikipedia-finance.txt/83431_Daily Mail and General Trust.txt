Daily Mail and General Trust


# Daily Mail and General Trust



**Daily Mail and General Trust** (**DMGT**) is a British multinational media conglomerate, the owner of the *Daily Mail* and several other titles. The 4th Viscount Rothermere is the chair and controlling shareholder of the company. The head office is located in Northcliffe House in Kensington, London. In January 2022, DMGT delisted from the London Stock Exchange following a successful offer for DMGT by Rothermere Continuation Limited.


## History

The group traces its origins to the launch in 1896 of the mid-market national newspaper the *Daily Mail* by Harold Harmsworth (later created, in July 1919, The 1st Viscount Rothermere) and his elder brother, Alfred. It was incorporated in 1922 and its shares were first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1932.

The 1st Viscount Rothermere's son, Esmond, took operational control of the organization in 1932 and complete control in November 1940, when his father died.

Vere Harmsworth became the Chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1970. Upon the death of his father in July 1978, he succeeded as The 3rd Viscount Rothermere and became chair of parent Daily Mail and General Trust plc.

After almost 100 years in Fleet Street, the company left its original premises of New Carmelite House in Fleet Street in 1988 to move to Northcliffe House in Kensington.

In 2019, DMGT joined the Belt and Road News Network.

In 2023, DMGT invested in Hexagon Cup, a Madrid-based padel competition.
