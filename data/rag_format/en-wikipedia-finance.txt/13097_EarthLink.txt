## History


### Early years

EarthLink was founded in July 1994 by Sky Dayton when he was 23 years old. Dayton was convinced of the need for a simple, user-friendly dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) after spending an entire week trying to configure his own computer for Internet access. Dayton set up his own network, going to a CompUSA store, purchasing 14-kilobyte modems and connecting them all together in Atwater Village, a location he picked because it was the widest possible area to which a local call could be made. The company later moved to Pasadena in 1996.

By 1995, EarthLink offered dial-up service in 98 cities, and was one of the first US ISPs to offer unlimited Internet access for a flat rate. In 1996, they began to offer Internet services for businesses, including ISDN and Frame Relay Internet access and web hosting.

In 1997, Earthlink began to provide 56K dial-up access, doubling the speed of its dial-up service.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ EarthLink also teamed up with Charter Communications to offer high-speed cable Internet access. In 1998, they entered partnerships with Sprint, Apple, CompUSA, and other companies that helped it reach 1 million members by the end of the year.

In 1999, EarthLink launched its TotalCommerce service for small business Web hosting and also became the first ISP to offer nationwide high-speed Internet access via DSL.


### MindSpring merger and other acquisitions

On February 4, 2000, the company, then based in Pasadena, California, merged with Atlanta-founded MindSpring, making it the second-largest ISP in the U.S., after AOL. Later that year, the company launched EarthLink Biz DSL service. EarthLink also acquired OneMain.com, a large, rural ISP, and Rural Connections in 2001.

In 2001, EarthLink partnered with DirecPC to offer a two-way satellite Internet service. The company also introduced a fixed-IP DSL service for the SOHO business market.

On June 10, 2002, EarthLink acquired PeoplePC, a low-priced dial-up ISP.

EarthLink launched a VoIP phone service for broadband users called Unlimited Voice in April 2003. The company also released several free tools for its members to block spam, viruses, and spyware.


### New ventures

New ventures during the mid 2000s include:

* A joint venture named SK-Earthlink, later renamed Helio, was sold in 2008.
* Earthlink acquired Aluria Software, LLC-a seller of anti-spyware software, based in Lake Mary, Florida.

* VoIP: EarthLink launched two new voice services between late 2005 and early 2006: a VoIP service called EarthLink trueVoice and a high-speed Internet and voice bundle called EarthLink DSL & Home Phone Service.

In July 2005, EarthLink closed its call centers to reduce costs.

In July 2013, EarthLink acquired CenterBeam, Inc., a provider of remote managed IT services—with an IT Support Center providing help desk, desktop technical support and application support services.

In August 2023, it was announced EarthLink had acquired the Athens, Texas-headquartered fiber and fixed wireless business internet provider, One Ring Networks for an undisclosed amount.


### Business network and data center expansion

In July 2013, EarthLink completed its previously announced plans to open four new data centers in San Jose, Chicago, Dallas and Miami on its next-generation cloud platform. This brought its total to eight.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Shortly later, the company deleted this statement without any clarification.


## TotalAccess

Earthlink's TotalAccess software bundled various tools, including a dialer, but had initial negative reception both from users and from hardware vendors such as Dell.
