## History


### Predecessors

The first national honor society in economics, **Omicron Delta Gamma**, was formed on May 7, 1915, by the merger of Harvard University's Undergraduate Society of Economics with the University of Wisconsin's Order of Artus, an economics student society modeled on King Arthur's Knights of the Roundtable. Wisconsin's group was founded by Professor John R. Commons. Frank W. Taussig, president of the American Economic Association in 1904–1905, founded the chapter at Harvard.

Alan A. Brown was the founder and first president of **Omicron Chi Epsilon** in 1955, while a student at City College of New York. Brown conceived the creation and development of an international honor society in economics. Friends and colleagues report that they were amazed watching this polite and deferring young person "pestering" Nobel Prize winners and other giants of the economics profession to endorse, become involved in, and support this initiative. The first annual meeting of Omicron Chi Epsilon was held at Fordham University in New York City in the spring of 1958. Brown subsequently learned of the existence of Omicron Delta Gamma, which, while older and formally larger with more campus chapters, was less active than the younger Omicron Chi Epsilon.


### Omicron Delta Epsilon

Alan A. Brown was the prime mover to facilitate a merger in 1963 between Omicron Delta Gamma and Omicron Chi Epsilon, renamed Omicron Delta Epsilon – The National Honor Society in Economics. Omicron Delta Epsilon's purpose is to recognize academic achievement in economics and to increase connections between students and faculty of economics within and amongst colleges and university.

Later, Brown replaced “National” with "International" in its non-Greek title and expanded the organization globally. The society's first president was Robert E. Hill of Kent State University. Omicron Delta Epsilon joined the Association of College Honor Societies in 1965 and was readmitted in 1981. By 2012, the society had 672 active chapters, 4,440 active members, and 89,500 initiates.

Omicron Delta Epsilon inducts approximately 4,000 collegiate members each year and has more than 100,000 living lifetime members. It has approximately 700 active chapters worldwide. A detailed history of ODE, written by long-serving executive secretary-treasurer of the organization William D. Gunther, was published in 2013 by *The American Economist* in recognition of its fiftieth birthday. Its national headquarters is located in Fairhope, Alabama. It is a member of the Allied Social Science Associations.
