# Unity Communications



**Unity Communications** is a business process outsourcing (BPO) company headquartered in Gilbert, Arizona, with a significant presence in the United States, Philippines, and Mexico. Founded in 2009, the bootstrapped company specializes in various outsourcing solutions, such as contact center as a service (CCaaS), customer service, technical support, healthcare BPO, and employer of record (EOR).


## History

Unity Communications was founded in Gilbert, Arizona, in 2009 by first-generation Korean American Patrick Brown, a former electronics technician for the U.S. Navy. The company has grown without any external investment funding, making it one of the few BPOs to be completely bootstrapped by its founder.

Brown expanded the company by leveraging his understanding of both U.S. business needs and the strengths of Asian labor markets. He established a presence in the Philippines and Mexico, emphasizing fair compensation and benefits for workers in these regions. This model of merging Asian labor with U.S. business opportunities has been a cornerstone of Unity Communications' growth strategy.

On June 16, 2023, the company launched its 200-seater Philippines headquarters in the Harton Corporate Center located in Aseana City, Para√±aque. It's the company's second office after its smaller site in Bacoor, Cavite. As of August 1, 2024, the Harton office has reached an employee count of 300.


## Leadership

Patrick Brown is the founder and CEO of Unity Communications. He attended Arizona State University where he majored in education. After being disillusioned with the education field, he left college within a semester of graduating to join the Navy STEM Program and became certified for basic electronics in order to fulfill his dream of living in Asia due to his Asian American heritage.

In 1995, Brown started his career in Yokosuka, Japan, working as an electronics technician on board the USS John S. McCain DDG-56. Since then, he has been an inbound sales and retention specialist, network consultant, business development executive, and director of telecommunication sales, and, finally, founder and CEO. His leadership has been instrumental in the company's organic growth and its ability to establish itself as a major player in the BPO industry without external funding.
