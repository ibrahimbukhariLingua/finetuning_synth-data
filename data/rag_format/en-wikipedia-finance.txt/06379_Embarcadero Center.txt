Embarcadero Center


# Embarcadero Center



**Embarcadero Center** is a commercial complex of four office towers, two hotels, and a shopping center located in San Francisco, California. An outdoor ice skating rink opens during winter months. As of 2024, only a handful of stores remained open.

Embarcadero Center sits on a 9.8-acre (4.0 ha) site largely bounded by Clay Street (to the north), Sacramento Street (to the south), Battery Street (to the west), and the Embarcadero (to the east), in the financial district of San Francisco.

The 4.8-million-square-foot (450,000 m²) complex accommodates offices for 14,000 people along with mixed-use areas accommodating retail, dining, entertainment, and cinema functions.


## History

In 1971, construction began with Tower One. The project was developed by Trammell Crow, David Rockefeller, and John Portman.

In 1989, the last off-complex extension, Embarcadero West, was completed. The two extension buildings are west of Battery.

In December 2005, Boston Properties sold the Embarcadero West building to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA-CREF) for more than US$205 million (equivalent to $320 million in 2023).

In February 2022, the cinema's operator closed its doors permanently.
