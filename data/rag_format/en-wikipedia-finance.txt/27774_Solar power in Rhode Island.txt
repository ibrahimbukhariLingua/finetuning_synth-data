Solar power in Rhode Island


# Solar power in Rhode Island



**Solar power in Rhode Island** has become economical due to new technological improvements and a variety of regulatory actions and financial incentives, particularly a 30% federal tax credit, available through 2016, for any size project. A typical residential installation could pay for itself in utility bill savings in 14 years, and generate a profit for the remainder of its 25 year life. Larger systems, from 10 kW to 5 MW, receive a feed-in tariff of up to 33.45¢/kWh.

Due to the state's small size and comparatively low insolation, solar installations are limited to predominantly rooftop and megawatt scale installations. Approximately 23% of electricity used in Rhode Island could be provided from rooftop solar panels.


## Government policy

The Government of Rhode Island has taken a variety of actions in order to encourage solar energy use within the state. Nineteen schools have installed 2 kW or larger solar arrays that can be monitored on the Internet, similar to the programs in Australia and New Zealand. A variety of solar arrays have been installed at state facilities, which can also be monitored.


### Net metering

The state has a net metering program that allows installations of up to 5 MW of on-site electrical generation to continuously roll over any excess generation to the next month, or purchased at avoided cost. Participation is limited to 3% of utilities peak demand for Block Island Power Company and Pascoag Utility District. National Grid has no limit. Peak demand for the state for 2011 was 21,477 MW.


### Renewable portfolio standard

The state adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in 2004 which requires all retail electricity providers, including non-regulated power producers and distribution companies, to "supply 100% of their retail electricity sales from renewable resources by 2033." The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission engaged InClime, Inc. to administer the Renewable Energy Standard Program.
