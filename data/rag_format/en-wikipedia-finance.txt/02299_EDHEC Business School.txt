EDHEC is accredited by EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA (triple accreditation). In 2019, EDHEC had 8,600 students enrolled in traditional graduate and undergraduate programs, 245 exchange and double-degree agreements, and an alumni network of more than 40,000 across 125 countries.


## History

EDHEC Business School was founded in Lille in 1906 by industrialists from northern France. Initially established as a commercial section within the *École des Hautes Études Industrielles (HEI)*, the school was created with the objective of addressing the commercial and industrial needs of northern France. Its founding occurred in the context of the broader industrial revolution that transformed northern France in the 19th century. Between 1850 and 1914, Lille and its neighbouring cities became major industrial and financial centres, prompting regional elites to seek ways to prepare their children and future professionals for business careers, ultimately leading to the creation of EDHEC.

In 1921, the commercial section was integrated into the *Faculté Libre de Droit*, becoming known as *HEC Nord* (French: *Hautes Études Commerciales du Nord*, lit. 'Advanced Business Studies of the North'). However, following a legal dispute with HEC Paris over the use of the name, the institution was renamed EDHEC (French: *École des Hautes Études Commerciales du Nord*, lit. 'School of Advanced Business Studies of the North') in 1951. The school received state accreditation in 1971. The alumni association, initially founded in 1947 as the *Amicale de l'EDHEC du Nord*, eventually became the *Association des Diplômés EDHEC*. This organization has played a key role in fostering connections among graduates and supporting the school's community. Since 1953, the association has published a bulletin titled *Quo Vadis* and later renamed *EDHEC Informations*.


## Academics

EDHEC Business School is a Grande école, a type of French higher education institution that operates independently from the public university system, though it often maintains connections with it. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a Grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France.

EDHEC Business School conducts academic research with a faculty of over 175 members. The school allocates approximately 20% of its budget to research. The school's research framework includes 13 centers and chairs, which collectively produce over 100 academic articles each year. These contributions cover a wide range of topics in business and finance.

In 2023, EDHEC sold 93% of its subsidiary, Scientific Beta, to the Singapore Exchange. Valued at €200 million and established in 2012, Scientific Beta focuses on alternative index design. It has developed a global client base, including pension funds and asset managers. The proceeds from this sale were used to finance EDHEC's research projects, including the development of a database for infrastructure investments and a fintech initiative evaluating the financial, social, and environmental risks of long-term investments.


## Student life

EDHEC has over 100 student organizations in areas such as sports, humanitarian work, arts, finance, and business services.

The EDHEC Sailing Cup is an annual event organized by students. First initiated in 1969 by three students, the event consists of an annual sailing regatta. By 1980, it had become the largest student sporting event in Europe.
