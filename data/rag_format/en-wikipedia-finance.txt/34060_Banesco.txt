## History

Banesco is one of the first Venezuelan banks holding only Venezuelan capital. It was founded in 1977 as the *Banco Agroindustrial Venezolano* (Venezuelan Agroindustrial Bank), until it changed its name to *Banco Financiero* (Financial Bank) in 1987. In 1992, after changing their name to *Bancentro*, the bank was acquired by the Banesco Financial Organization, the banking division came to dominate the company and was combined with the other divisions to form a *banco universal* (universal bank) (i.e. a bank that competes in all banking sectors like commercial banking, investment banking, lending, etc.).

Banesco Banco Universal was first founded as a brokerage house, in 1986, under the name of Escotet Casa de Bolsa. It started working on the financial industry in 1992, after the acquisition and takeover of a regional bank named Grupo Bancentro, that after this , obtained the name Grupo Financiero Banesco (Banesco Financial Group). Since then, the founders of this institution have emerged other banking business with their own, turning them into Banesco Banco Universal in 2002.

Additionally, Banesco Fondo Mutual, Banesco Sociedad Administradora de Fondos Mutuales, Banesco Sociedad Financiera, Banesco Seguros, Banesco Banco Internacional Puerto Rico, Banesco Banco Internacional Panamá and Banesco Mercado de Capitales were created. Thus, the expansion of this banking business started to happen into new frontiers.
* 1997 – The Emergency Financial Assistance approved the merging between Banesco Comercial, Banesco Arrendamiento Financiero and Banesco Fondo de Activos Líquidos. That same year, the Banking Superintendence authorized Banesco Comercial C.A. to start working as an international bank, called Banesco Banco Universal. Its website is launched for the first time.

## Branches

Banesco has 340 branches all over Venezuela. The most relevant branches are the following:

**Ciudad Banesco**

It is the building in which the main offices are located, in Caracas. The building used to be used for the department store Sears Roebuck of Venezuela, until it left the country and was bought by another department store brand, Maxi's. Banesco bought the building in 2004 and reopened it under a brand new concept, which suits the bank's needs better than it did before.

Thanks to the changes made, Ciudad Banesco became an eco-friendly building, thus the materials used to its refurbishments. Ciudad Banesco was awarded with the Premio Annual Construcción 2004 (Annual Building Awards), given by Cámara Venezolana de la Construcción (Venezuela's Construction Chamber).

**Torre Banesco (Banesco Tower)**

This installation has two buildings located in El Rosal, in Caracas; both buildings were Banesco's main offices until 2004, when they got moved into Ciudad Banesco. Currently, some offices are still operating in these buildings.

**Esquina El Chorro Branch**

This tower is located in Avenida Universidad, downtown Caracas. Initially, it was called Torre Union (Union Tower) property of the old banking business Banco Union that, after the merging with Caja Familia (member of Grupo Banesco) it became Unibanca. After the merging process had finished, it became Banesco and the tower was sold to the Venezuelan government. Currently, it serves as the main office for the Ministerio de Educación Universitaria, Ciencia y Tecnología (Ministry of High Education, Culture and Technology).

Its former vaults, where Banco Union used to be, have been turned into a printing warehouse, where all the governmental material is printed, such as books and other hand-outs, it also is the main office for the Fundación Impresa Cultural, an extension for the National Printing House (where National Gazettes get printed) next to the main entrance, there is a little square called "Plaza Unión" (Union Square), but in 2002 it changed its name for "Plaza Unibanca" (Unibanca Square). However, and after the selling of the building, the square passed to be called "Plaza de los Saberes" (Knowledge Square).
