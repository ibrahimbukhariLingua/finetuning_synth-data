## History

Dematic began in 1819 in Wetter, Germany with the founding of Mechanische Werkstätten Harkort & Co, which was incorporated into Deutsche Maschinenbau-Aktiengesellschaft (Demag) in 1910, then acquired by Mannesmann in 1973. After the acquisition of U.S. Rapistan (specialised in conveyor systems), Mannesmann Demag Fördertechnik AG was established in 1992. In 1993, Australian racking and shelving manufacturer Colby was added, and in 1997 the company was renamed to Mannesmann Dematic AG. Four years later, Siemens bought the company and merged it with its own logistics activities to form Siemens Dematic AG. In 2006 Siemens carved out the industrial and distribution logistics portion as Dematic GmbH & Co. KG. In the same year, the investment firm Triton acquired the majority of shares.
