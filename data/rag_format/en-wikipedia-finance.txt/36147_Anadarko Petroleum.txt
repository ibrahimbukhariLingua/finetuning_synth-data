## History

Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the western part of the state of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, and extending into southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado.

In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off, and Anadarko became a public company.

In 1999, the company purchased a 7.5-acre (30,000 m²) tract in The Woodlands, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company to build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m²), 32-story headquarters building, on the site. In 2012, the company began construction of another office tower adjacent to its headquarters. The company named its two office towers after former CEOs. The buildings were completed in 2014.

### *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill involvement

Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was 65% owned and operated by BP, and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay costs related to any incident in proportion to its 25% ownership—except when caused by the operating partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Anadarko contended that gross negligence or willful misconduct by BP led to the explosion.


#### Settlement with BP

In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf.

In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.

In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion and its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP in return for indemnification by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.


#### Fine under the Clean Water Act

In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the *Deepwater Horizon* explosion. The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill." The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the *Deepwater Horizon* accident.


### Tronox litigation and settlements

In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.

The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, in 2006, Kerr-McGee spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities. According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its oil and gas assets with Anadarko acquiring the remainder of Kerr-McGee.


#### Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders

In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other liabilities Tronox would assume from Kerr-McGee.


#### Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice

The United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.

In April 2014, the parties reached a $5.15 billion settlement in what was at the time the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history. Since then the total amount for the complete and comprehensive cleanup of the BP DeepWater Horizon incident has passed $60 billion.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
