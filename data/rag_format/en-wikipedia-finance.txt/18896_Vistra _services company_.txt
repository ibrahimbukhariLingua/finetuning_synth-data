# Vistra (services company)



**Vistra** is a global professional services provider specializing in fund administration, corporate, fiduciary and administrative services. Headquartered in Hong Kong, Vistra supports multinational corporations, private equity and real estate funds and high-net-worth individuals with compliance, structuring and other essential services for navigating complex regulatory environments. Vistra operates in more than 50 jurisdictions across the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Middle East, with an extensive network that enables cross-border business solutions.


## History

Founded in 1986, Vistra has grown through a series of strategic acquisitions and organic expansion, establishing a reputation as a comprehensive service provider for international businesses and private equity funds. The company's initial focus on fiduciary services has since broadened to encompass a wide range of corporate, fund administration and advisory services. Its growth strategy has focused on acquiring companies with complementary services, thereby expanding its capabilities and geographic reach.


## Acquisitions

Vistra has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand its global footprint and service offerings. Notably, in 2011, Vistra merged with **Offshore Incorporations Limited** (OIL), a leading company formation specialist in Asia, renowned for pioneering the use of offshore entities to facilitate international trade, investments and capital market transactions. The merger created a global leader in trust and corporate services by combining OIL's strong presence in Asia with Vistra's international reach. In 2022, Vistra merged with **Tricor Group**, a Hong Kong-based business expansion specialist. Tricor’s extensive presence in Asia, particularly its stronghold in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, enhanced Vistra’s service capabilities in corporate and business services throughout Asia-Pacific. The acquisition positioned Vistra as one of the most significant players in the region, particularly for corporate services and compliance solutions.

In 2024, Vistra announced the acquisition of the **Phoenix American fund administration and transfer agent group**. Phoenix American, based in Larkspur, California, specializes in back-office support for private equity and alternative investment funds. By integrating Phoenix American’s fund administration capabilities, Vistra significantly broadened its offerings for the North American market, particularly for private equity and real estate funds. Phoenix American’s established reputation in the U.S. for investor services and transfer agency bolstered Vistra’s fund services division, enhancing Vistra’s appeal to U.S.-based fund managers and investors.
