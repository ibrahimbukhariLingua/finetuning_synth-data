In 1995, Cowan co-founded network infrastructure company Verisign and served as its initial chairman. The company went public in 1998 and is currently traded on NASDAQ.

In 1996, Cowan co-founded mobile email software platform Visto, serving as its initial CEO. Visto later purchased Good Technology and the merged company was acquired by Blackberry in 2015.

He served on the Board of Auth0, which was acquired by Okta for $6.5 billion; Bessemer owned greater than 20% of the company at that time, generating over $1.2 billion in gains for the firm.


### Other professional activities

Cowan is the host of the *Wish I Knew* podcast, winner of the 2024 Webby Award for Best Business Podcast. The show aims to share the life-changing moments that founders, CEOs and leaders discovered along their business journeys and why taking risks leads to growth.

In 2006, Cowan published a blog post questioning claims made regarding the dietary supplement Airborne, which he alleged was improperly marketed as a cold remedy.
