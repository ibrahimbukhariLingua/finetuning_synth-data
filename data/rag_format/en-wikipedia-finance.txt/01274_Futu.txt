## Controversies


### CSRC Orders Futu and Tiger Brokers to Cease New Mainland China Customer Registrations

In late 2022, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) ordered Futu and Tiger Brokers to stop accepting new customers from mainland China. This followed ongoing concerns from authorities since 2021 about the regulatory compliance of their cross-border brokerage operations. While the platforms are no longer allowed to onboard new mainland-based investors, existing customers can continue trading, but without the ability to add new capital. Additionally, both brokers were required to pull their trading apps from mainland China.
