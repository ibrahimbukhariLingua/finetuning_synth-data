## History

Whole Foods Market was the first retailer to pick up Kuli Kuli’s Moringa Superfood Bars, starting in Northern California. Kuli Kuli expanded to over 11,000 retail locations, including 2,500 Walmart locations.

Kuli Kuli sources its *Moringa oleifera* from family farmers and women's farming cooperatives in West Africa, Latin America, and South-East Asia.
