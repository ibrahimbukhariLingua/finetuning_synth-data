## History

*Fuji Xerox* was established in 1962 as a 50:50 partnership with Rank Xerox. Rank Xerox was absorbed into Xerox Corporation in 1997.

Initially serving as a distributor exclusively for Rank Xerox products, Fuji Xerox transitioned into independent research and development, introducing its proprietary xerographic machines and devices. Notably, their pioneering venture began with the creation of the FX2200 photocopier in 1973, acknowledged as the world's smallest copier at the time. Beyond distribution, Fuji Xerox played a pivotal role in advancing color printing technologies, contributing to the innovation and manufacturing of various devices marketed by Xerox Corporation. Among their milestones is the introduction of the "Xero Printer 100" in 1987, recognized as the world's first multifunction printer/copier.

Fuji Xerox expanded into Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia in 1982 by purchasing distribution rights from Xerox Corporation, it established a subsidiary company Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific Pte headquartered in Singapore.

In 2000, Xerox Corporation transferred its China/Hong Kong operations to Fuji Xerox, and by 2001, Fuji Photo Film Co. had elevated its stake in the venture to 75%.

As of March 2009, the company employed 40,646 people (Consolidated).

On January 31, 2018, Xerox announced an agreement with Fujifilm for the acquisition of a 50.1% controlling stake in the company, amounting to US$6.1 billion. This move aimed to merge the two entities into Fuji Xerox, establishing a company with an aggregate market value of US$18 billion However, the deal was called off in May 2018 following resistance by Xerox's board.

On November 5, 2019, Fujifilm had announced that they would acquire the remaining 25% stake of Fuji Xerox from Xerox for a total of $2.3 Billion.

On January 6, 2020, Fujifilm announced that it would not renew its technology agreement with Xerox when it expires at the end of March 2021, and that Fuji Xerox would be renamed *Fujifilm Business Innovation Corporation* in April 2021. Fujifilm stated that unwinding the venture would allow them to "utilise our own technologies and synergise with technologies owned by other Fujifilm Group companies to produce/market products and solutions under our own new brand worldwide". The company will maintain its product supply agreements with Xerox.
