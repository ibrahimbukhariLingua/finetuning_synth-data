SPDR


# SPDR



**SPDR** funds (pronounced "spider") are a family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the United States, Europe, Mexico and Asia-Pacific and managed by State Street Global Advisors (SSGA). Informally, they are also known as **Spyders** or **Spiders**. SPDR is a trademark of Standard and Poor's Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global. The name is an acronym for the first member of the family, the *Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts*, now the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF, which is designed to track the S&P 500 stock market index.

The SPDR S&P 500 Trust is the largest ETF in the world by total assets under management. SSGA also manage the SPDR Gold Shares, the largest commodity based ETF in the world.

The funds are formulated as unit investment trusts. In 2007, SSGA rebranded its other United States ETFs as SPDRs, including the StreetTRACKS family and its other flagship ETF shares, the DOW DIAMONDS, that tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This move united all U.S. ETFs managed by SSGA, a total of 23 at that time, under a single brand.
At the end of 2006, the total portfolio that became known as SPDRs had $102 billion of assets under management.

As of Dec 2019, SPDR is the third largest ETF provider, behind iShares and Vanguard, with assets of $714 bn.


## Other funds

In 1995, Mid-Cap SPDRs were launched by the Bank of New York to track Standard & Poor's S&P 400 index of middle-market equity shares.

The DIAMONDS were developed, like the original SPDR, by SSGA in cooperation with the American Stock Exchange. DOW DIAMOND shares are designed to track the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

In 1998, SSGA and Merrill Lynch introduced the *Sector Spiders*, which now consist of ten funds which follow the eleven GICS sectors of the S&P 500.
Because the S&P 500 contains only four telecommunications companies, those companies are a part of the information technology SPDR, and that one fund represents those two sectors.

SSGA also launched a number of index-based ETFs under the brand *StreetTRACKS*. These were renamed SPDRs in 2007.

SSGA also manages ETFs that are sold on exchanges outside the United States.

In Australia SSGA manages three SPDR branded ETFs.
They are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and are the following:

* S&P/ASX 50 Fund (50 top market cap stocks)
* S&P/ASX 200 Fund (200 top market cap stocks)
