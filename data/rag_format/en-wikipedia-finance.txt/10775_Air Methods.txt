The company was founded by Roy Morgan and began air medical operations in 1980. From 1991 to 2017, the company was a publicly traded company under the NASDAQ ticker "AIRM." In 2017, it was acquired by private equity firm American Securities.

## History

In 1980, Roy Morgan founded **Air Methods** after a personal experience convinced him that properly equipped and staffed air medical service helicopters were a necessity.

Air Methods purchased CJ Systems Aviation Group, a leading provider of aeromedical transport, in October 2007.

In 2011, Air Methods acquired Omniflight Helicopters, Inc., operating it as a wholly owned subsidiary. Omniflight Helicopters consisted of over 100 helicopters.

In July 2011, Air Methods (Air Methods International, Ltd.) entered into a joint venture agreement with Basari Holding, AS and Anka Aerospace & Defense, LLC to form Helistar, AS. The joint venture company is headquartered in Ankara, Turkey.

In October 2012, Air Methods opened its state-of-the-art technologically advanced training center in Aurora, Colorado. Located near the corporate office, the 14,000-square-foot facility has simulation areas, learning classrooms and office space. Also in 2012, the company diversified into helicopter tourism.

In 2016, Air Methods acquired Tri-State Care Flight.

In 2017, Air Methods was purchased by American Securities LLC.

In Apri 2023, Sundance Helicopters was acquired.

On October 24, 2023, Air Methods filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, blaming high interest rates and labor costs as part of its decision to file for bankruptcy. The company stated that it has plans to shed high amounts of debt, and that it would continue to operate normally during the bankruptcy process.

On December 28, 2023, Air Methods would emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, successfully achieving its goal of eliminating around $1.7 billion of debt. The company stated that its assets were acquired by its lenders, releasing plans to inject $185 million into the company.


## Service models

Air Methods provides services through three basic programs: Community-Based Service model (CBS), Hospital-Based Service model (HBS) and Alternative-Delivery Model (ADM). Under all three programs, Air Methods transports persons requiring intensive medical care from either the scene of an accident or general care hospitals, to trauma centers or tertiary care centers. Air Methods employees provide medical care to patients en route.

The tourism division comprises Sundance Helicopters, Inc. and Blue Hawaiian Helicopters, which provide helicopter tours and charter flights in the Las Vegas/Grand Canyon region and Hawaii, respectively. Air Methods’ fleet of owned, leased or maintained aircraft features over 450 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

Rocky Mountain Holdings, LLC (RMH), Mercy Air Service, Inc. (Mercy Air), and LifeNet, Inc. (LifeNet) operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of Air Methods.

The Direct Patient Logistics (DPL) transfer center is a division of Air Methods that coordinates transfers between hospitals and referring centers. It is the center point of coordination between all parties involved in the transfer process.

AirCom is the dispatching/coordinating/and flight tracking division of Air Methods. It dispatches over 450 aircraft for Air Methods Corporation as well as dispatching and coordinating services for other agencies, including police departments, county departments, ambulance services, and other public service agencies.

Along with dispatching aircraft, Air Methods has teamed up with Community Health Systems and sister company Quorum Health Systems to allow for hospitals owned by those companies to have a transport call center that they can use for ease of access in finding an aircraft. The program allows for the hospitals to call the communications center and pass off flight requests to a specialist so that doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff can focus more on patient care. The Transport Call Center took their first call from Big Bend Hospital in Alpine, Texas on November 12, 2011. From November 2011 to January 2015, the CHS/QHC Transport Call Center was located in Nashville, Tennessee. It was then relocated to the Air Methods Communications Center in Omaha, Nebraska.

* On August 26, 2011 four people (three crew members and one patient) were killed when a LifeNet Eurocopter AS350 based at Rosecrans Airport and connected to Heartland Hospital in St. Joseph, Missouri crashed near Liberty, Missouri. Initial crash reports indicated it had run out of fuel. The helicopter had traveled 45 miles from St. Joseph to Harrison County Community Hospital in Bethany, Missouri to pick up a patient. It did not refuel before traveling another 70 miles en route to its intended destination at Liberty Hospital. It was reported to be within a mile of landing for fuel at Midwest National Air Center in Mosby, Missouri (near Liberty) when it crashed. In 2013 the NTSB received information indicating that texting may have been a contributing cause, making it the first time texting had been found to occur during a fatal air accident.
