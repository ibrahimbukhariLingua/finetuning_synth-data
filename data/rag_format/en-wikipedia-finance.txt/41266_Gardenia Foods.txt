In 2019, Gardenia stated that its products would be in compliance with the Government of Singapore ban via the Ministry of Health in accordance with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) on hydrogenated oils (PHOs), a major source of artificial trans fat. It also added that all of their products at the time were already PHO-free since the early 2000s prior to the ban, which came into effect in June 2021.
