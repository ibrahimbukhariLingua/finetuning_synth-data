## History

On October 25, 2013, Century Pacific Food, Inc. was incorporated as a subsidiary of Century Pacific Group, Inc. (formerly Century Canning Corporation) to consolidate the food manufacturing portfolio of the Century Pacific Group. It became listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange on May 6, 2014. The parent company, Century Pacific Group, Inc., was established by Ricardo S. Po, Sr. (1931–2021) on December 12, 1978 as Century Canning Corporation, whose primary business was the distribution and sales of canned and processed fish products derived from tuna, sardines, and milkfish.

In 2024, Century Pacific Food entered into a multiyear coco product contract to supply Vita Coco with 90 million liters of coconut water until 2029. "The contract covers additional volume requirements by Vita Coco, which will entail new capacity requiring a capital expenditure investment of some $40 million creating 1,500 manufacturing jobs", CNPF Vice President Noel Tempongko Jr. said. The new contract is supplemental to the 2020 agreement.
