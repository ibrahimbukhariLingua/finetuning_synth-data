## History

Consumer credit suppliers, like Western Circle, were regulated in the UK by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) until April 2014, but has since been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The firm's activity under the OFT was too small to cause any headlines, and hence didn't get direct criticism like more active companies in its sector, such as Wonga. The activity of the company is allied to the strict regulations of the FCA. The new regulations force much fairer practices in comparison to the period up to 2014, and hence no significant complaints arrived to the media.


### NHS Nurses publication

In October 2016, Western circle published a research based on survey done of 160,000 of clients, claiming that the sector of NHS Nurses is heavily dependent on Payday Loans. According to the research, the number of nurses using payday loans has doubled in 3 years, since 2013. This research brought the matter of the small wages given to the nurses in UK to the attention of media outlets. The claims were that nurses' salaries were frozen for more than 6 years, in some cases, and caused them much financial distress. The matter of the NHS continues to be an important issue of public discussion in the UK.
