**Lixil Group** (Lixilグループ株式会社, *Lixil Gurūpu kabushiki-kaisha*) is a Japanese group of companies that manufactures building materials, plumbing fixtures and housing equipment, headquartered in Tokyo.

INAX (株式会社INAX, *Kabushiki gaisha Inakkusu*) is one of the major Lixil companies. Most of Lixil's plumbing fixtures are sold under the brand. Other Lixil companies include American Standard, Permasteelisa, Grohe, etc.


## History

The company was formed in 2011 by the merger of Tostem Corp. (a supplier of building materials), INAX (manufacturer of toilets and bathtubs), Shin Nikkei (maker of materials for skyscrapers), Sunwave (a kitchen company) and Toyo Exterior (manufacturer of gates and fences).

In the same year Lixil bought Permasteelisa, an Italian developer of curtain walls, for €575 million. Two years later Lixil bought American Standard Brands, a U.S. bathroom fixtures company for $542 million and in 2014 Grohe, the German bathroom fixtures company for €3.06 billion. It also started manufacturing in Andhra Pradesh, India.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On 6 November 2018, LIXIL announced a new partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to bring what could be the world's first "reinvented toilet" for household use to pilot in at least two markets. This stems from the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge.


## SaTo

Lixil markets water-saving toilets and related products under the brand "SaTo", short for "Safe Toilet". These products are marketed in various countries with plumbing infrastructure deficiencies, including Bangladesh, Uganda, Kenya, Haiti and India as of 2018.


## Sponsorships

Lixil is the sponsor of the Lixil Cup, awarded from 2014 to 2016 to the champion team from the finals of Japan's Top League, which the nation's highest level rugby union competition.

The company also sponsors tennis player Kei Nishikori, and was a sponsor of the 2020 Olympic Games.

Following their predecessor company Tostem Corp's longstanding shirt sponsorship of the J.League football club, the Kashima Antlers, Lixil has continued this shirt sponsorship since 2011, when the merger with Tostem occurred.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
