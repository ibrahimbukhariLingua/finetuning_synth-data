## History

The company traces its origins to 1928 in the United States with the establishment of National Aluminate Corporation - formed from the merger of Chicago Chemical Company and the Aluminum Sales Corporation. In 1959 it changed its name to Nalco Chemical Company; and in 1964, it became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It acquired Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories in 1966, and the marine business from Bull & Roberts (now Waltron) in 1984.

The company was delisted from NYSE and renamed to Ondeo Nalco Company, following its 1999 acquisition by the French company, Suez (presently GDF Suez).

On 9 December 2003, the private equity group consisting of the Blackstone Group, Apollo Management LP and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners collaborated to acquire Ondeo Nalco Company from Suez SA for US$4.2 billion. The Company went public again, returning to the New York Stock Exchange in late 2004 under the name **Nalco Holding Company**.

In 2007, Nalco Water achieved sales of more than US$3.9 billion.

In July 2011, Nalco Water announced a merger with Ecolab, Inc., and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. in December 2011 after the completion of the US$5.4 billion acquisition by Ecolab.
