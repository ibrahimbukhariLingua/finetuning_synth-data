The Directive prohibits abusive practices in agriculture. Article 3 prohibits a group of defined actions, including late payments by buyers to suppliers, cancellations at short notice, unilateral alteration of terms, threats of commercial retaliation and payments by suppliers to the buyers (i.e. from farmers to supermarkets) for stocking, adverts, marketing or staff.
