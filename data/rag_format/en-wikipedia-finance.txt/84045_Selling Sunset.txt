## Production

Series creator Adam DiVello got the idea for the show when he saw an advertisement for the Oppenheim Group in a magazine. "I ripped it out and gave it to my development executive… and I said, 'Call these people. Get me an interview with them'", Divello told *Vanity Fair* in 2020. "It was pretty remarkable that it's like an all-female ensemble cast, and these two twin brothers were running it. To me, it seemed like a no-brainer."


## Franchise

*Selling Sunset* became a franchise with the premiere of a second series, titled *Selling Tampa*, on December 15, 2021. This series follows the Allure Realty firm in Florida. It was cancelled after one season. A third series, *Selling the OC*, premiered on August 24, 2022. It is a direct spin-off to *Selling Sunset*, focusing on another branch of the Oppenheim Group in Newport Beach. Many members of the original series makes appearances in the spin-off while some members of *OC* also appears in *Sunset*.

On January 3, 2025, a fourth series, *Selling the City*, premiered on Netflix. It follows the Douglas Elliman firm agents in New York City.


## Controversies

Celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen have questioned the authenticity of the show. A long-term real estate agent in LA told the Mail that "The Oppenheim brothers are the real deal but none of us have ever come across the women they have working for them. It's clear these 'girls', as they call them on the show, were hired to make the show sizzle." Star Chrishell Stause has fought back against the accusations, going so far as to post a picture of her real estate license online to dismiss the rumors.
