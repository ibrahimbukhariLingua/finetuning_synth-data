The Food Trust


# The Food Trust



**The Food Trust** is a nonprofit organization. It was founded in 1992 by Duane Perry in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The current executive director is Yael Lehmann. The goal of the organization is to improve the health of children and adults by providing better nutrition. The Food Trust works with neighborhoods, schools, grocers, farmers and policymakers to implement a comprehensive approach to improved food access that combines nutrition education and greater availability of affordable, healthy food. It is currently operating 25 farmer's markets in the Philadelphia region. The markets accept SNAP/food stamps (EBT/Access cards), Farmers' Market Nutrition Program vouchers and Philly Food Bucks. The Food Trust is funded by private foundations, government grants, and individual donors.


## History

In 1992, The Food Trust – then known as The Farmers' Market Trust – began directing nutrition education classes for inner-city children at Reading Terminal Market, a Philadelphia farmer's market. The organization proceeded to open its first farmer's market at Tasker Homes, a public housing development in the Grays Ferry neighborhood of Philadelphia. Once a week, with the help of the Tasker Homes Tenant Council, the organization's small staff set up one long table of produce. "People hadn't seen that kind of quality produce in their neighborhood before," The Food Trust founder Duane Perry recalls. In the two decades since the opening of the Tasker Homes market, The Food Trust has worked with neighborhoods, schools, grocers, farmers and policymakers in Philadelphia and across the country to change public understanding of healthy food and to increase its availability.


## Partners

The Food Trust has a private–public partnership with Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative (FFFI). Since its launch in 2004, FFFI has funded 83 supermarket projects throughout the state. The $85 million partnership is managed by The Reinvestment Fund. It has provided funding for 88 fresh-food retail projects in 34 Pennsylvania counties, creating or preserving more than 5,023 jobs.

In 2013, the three organizations launched the Healthy Food Access Portal to bring together the rapidly growing body of research, tools, and resources for healthy food access advocates, practitioners, and food system entrepreneurs. This site harnesses data and resources to equip communities with the tools and information needed to successfully plan and implement equitable policies, programs, and projects, as well as to launch innovative food system businesses that improve access to healthy food in low-income communities and communities of color.

The organization also hosts events alongside the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger and Philabundance.
