**Park Tower at Transbay** is a 43-story, 605-foot (184 m) office skyscraper in San Francisco, California. The tower is located on Block 5 of the San Francisco Transbay development plan at the corner of Beale and Howard Streets, near the Salesforce Transit Center.

## History

Block 5, an area bounded by Howard, Main, Beale and Natoma Streets, was formerly a state-owned parcel used for ramps leading to the since-demolished Transbay Terminal and Embarcadero Freeway. The block is bisected by a driveway for the neighboring Providian Financial Building. Although zoned for residential development, the San Francisco Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure issued a request for proposal for a 550-foot (170 m) tower with 700,000 square feet (65,000 m²) of office space.

Four development teams submitted proposals for the site: Boston Properties with Kohn Pedersen Fox; Golub Real Estate and The John Buck Company with Goettsch Partners and Solomon Cordwell Buenz; Jay Paul Company with Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; and Kilroy Realty with Pelli Clarke Pelli. The proposal from Golub Real Estate and The John Buck Company was ultimately selected, featuring a number of large, outdoor terraces on both the northwest and southeast corners of the building. The development group paid US$172.5 million to acquire the property in September 2015. Ceremonial groundbreaking took place on October 6, 2015, with MetLife taking a majority stake in the project, reportedly worth US$345 million for a 95% ownership stake. The lobby was designed by Interior Architects.
