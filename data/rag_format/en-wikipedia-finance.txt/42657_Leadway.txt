## History

Leadway Assurance, established in 1970 by Sir Hassan O. Odukale, has a history that traces its evolution from modest beginnings to a significant presence in Nigeria's insurance industry. The company commenced operations in 1971, initially focusing on direct motor insurance, serving the insurance needs of individuals and businesses.

In its early years, Leadway received support from organisations including the Northern Nigerian Development Company (NNDC) and the Bank of the North, aiding its market establishment. Sir Hassan O. Odukale, the founder, secured the N50,000 statutory deposit required by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) by mortgaging his home.

During the late 1970s, Leadway began expanding its product offerings beyond motor insurance. The company introduced life insurance policies, broadening its customer base and market position.

The 1980s marked a transformation for Leadway as it transitioned from a traditional retail underwriter to collaborating with brokers, entering the corporate market. In 1982, the company underwrote several marine insurance policies through a broker, paying a substantial claim of approximately $1 million. This event demonstrated Leadway's capacity to handle large-scale risks.

As Leadway's financial strength grew, meeting up with the new minimum wage capital, the company continued to diversify its product offerings. The introduction of specialised insurance products, such as oil and gas insurance, addressed the needs of different industries.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Leadway expanded its reach and capabilities. The establishment of subsidiaries such as Leadway Capital & Trust in 1999 and Leadway Pensure in 2004 expanded the company's financial services portfolio. These subsidiaries offered services including annuities, trusts, wills, and pension fund administration. The company's leadership also saw changes. Recently, Tunde Hassan-Odukale stepped down, and Gboyega Lesi was appointed as the acting Managing Director.
