## Early life and family

With more than 30 years of experience in the world of banking and finance, Julio Herrera Velutini represents the seventh generation of bankers in his family.

The Herrera Velutini family is one of the largest landowners in Venezuela. Its history dates back to 14th century Spain in the Kingdom of Castile, where it began with Pedro de Herrera y Rojas, Lord of Ampudia and the House of Herrera, to consolidate a dynasty of landowners, conquerors, merchants and later, bankers with influence in Spain, the Canary Islands, Latin America, Germany, and England. It has also marked its influence in trade and fashion in Spain, North and Latin America, and more recently in the United Kingdom and other countries. Most of the family wealth comes from the inheritance of the family's business and activities in the field of finance, banking and real estate since the 14th century.

His family tree includes José Herrera Uslar, Venezuelan ambassador to Sweden, who in 1950 promoted the adoption of children orphaned by World War II. Herrera Uslar organized the transfer of 1,000 orphaned refugee children from Switzerland who would arrive in the country in batches of 50 and would be taken to the colony of Catia La Mar, where they would remain while being adopted by Venezuelan families.
