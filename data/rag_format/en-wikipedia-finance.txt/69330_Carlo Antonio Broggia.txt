# Carlo Antonio Broggia



**Carlo Antonio Broggia** (1698–1767) was an Italian merchant and economist. Author of many works, he was a reformer and theoretician of taxation.


## Life

Carlo was born in Naples, the son of Giuseppe Broggia. In 1717 he moved from Naples to Venice where he lived with his uncle (a priest) for nine years studying business economics. Back to Naples in 1726, he continued his studies under the supervision of Bartolomeo Intieri.
He also studied philosophy, particularly Paolo Mattia Doria [fr] and Giambattista Vico.

In 1743 *Trattato de' tributi, delle monete e del governo politico della sanità* was printed. In this book he argues that the tax system should be reformed and based on the individual contributory capacity.

By 1744 he wrote *La vita civil-economica*, remained unpublished.

In 1754 Broggia wrote *Memoria ad oggetto di varie politiche ed economiche ragioni*, a controversial book against the fiscal policy imposed by the minister Leopoldo De Gregorio which took him to exile.

Back to Naples in 1761, he wrote *Memoria contro il dazio del minutillo* in which he expresses his ideas against the export taxes. He died in his home city of Naples.
