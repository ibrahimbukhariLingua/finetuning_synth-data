# Destination principle



The **destination principle** is a concept of international taxation which allows for value added taxes to be retained by the country where the taxed product is being sold. They are collected on imports and rebated on exports.

According to Alan V. Deardorff at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, the origin principle, in contrast to the destination principle in international taxation is the principle "that value added taxes be kept only by the country where production takes place".

In contrast, the destination principle, which allows for value added taxes to be retained by the country where the taxed product is being sold.
