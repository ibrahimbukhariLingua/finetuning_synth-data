Carbon tariff


# Carbon tariff



A **carbon tariff** or **carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)** is an eco-tariff on embedded carbon. In 2024 the United States said it is not a carbon tax, but the World Trade Organization is dysfunctional so is unable to agree or disagree. One aim to prevent carbon leakage from nations without a carbon price. Examples of imports which are high-carbon and so may be subject to a carbon tariff are electricity generated by coal-fired power stations, iron and steel from blast furnaces, and fertilizer from the Haber process. Several countries levy carbon tariffs or are considering them.
