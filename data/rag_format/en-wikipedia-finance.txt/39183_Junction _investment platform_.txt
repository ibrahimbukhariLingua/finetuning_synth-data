Junction (investment platform)


# Junction (investment platform)



**Junction** was a San Franciscoâ€“based online investment platform that allowed accredited investors to purchase limited partnership interests in funds that invested in major motion pictures. It differed from donation-based crowdfunding for film finance as members of Junction received investment participation indirectly in the film projects rather than gifts, and the projects listed on Junction were already fully financed. Investors became limited partners in a fund with economic exposure to the film project through an investment agreement with one of the film's financiers.

Junction's business was facilitated by the United States Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, the passage of which in 2012 created new avenues for companies to solicit investments.
