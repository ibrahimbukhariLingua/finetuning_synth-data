In 1997, Dovigi followed his cousins into the National Hockey League (NHL) in Canada when he was drafted 41st as a goalie by the Edmonton Oilers in that year's entry draft. Although passionate about playing hockey, a teammate of Dovigi's recalls that, "We were thinking only about hockey. His [Dovigi's] mind was somewhere else".


## Early career

While playing minor league hockey, Dovigi began gaining business and entrepreneurial experience. From 1999 to 2002, Dovigi served as vice president of Right Lease, a construction equipment and automotive leasing company. In 2002, Dovigi gained exposure to corporate finance when he joined Brovi Investments. It was while working at Brovi Investments that Dovigi gained his first experience in waste management.

In 2004, a waste transfer station in Maple, Ontario suffered a fire. Brovi Investments had a mortgage on this waste transfer station and Dovigi was assigned to oversee the station's clean-up.

In 2004, Dovigi took a seat on the board of NGTV, otherwise known as "No Good TV", which was a YouTube music and celebrity channel and an organization chaired by Kiss bassist and vocalist Gene Simmons.


## Green For Life Environmental Inc.

In 2007, Dovigi founded Green For Life Environmental Inc. He would go on to acquire several local haulers, including National Waste Services. GFL later won a $186-million, nine-year contract to manage and collect the residential waste of 155,000 homes in the west end of Toronto.

In 2016, GFL gained an equity investment from Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, which raised the total value of GFL to roughly $2.4 billion.

In April 2018, GFL negotiated a recapitalization with BC Partners and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan at $5.125 billion. In October 2018, GFL merged with Waste Industries in a deal that valued Waste Industries at US$2.825 billion (approximately C$3.65 billion). The merger doubled GFL's presence in the United States.
