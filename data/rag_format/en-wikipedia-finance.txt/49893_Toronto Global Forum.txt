The Toronto Global Forum is a not-for-profit organization presenting annual conferences on national and global economic issues. The TGF mission is to promote open debate and dialogues on national and international issues. Each year, the event welcomes heads of state, Fortune 500 CEOs, international organizations, central bank governors, global economic decision makers and civil society representatives, etc. to foster free discussion between world leaders.
