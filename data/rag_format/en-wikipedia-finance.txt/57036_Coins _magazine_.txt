# Coins (magazine)



***Coins*** (formerly *Coins: The Magazine of Coin Collecting*) was an American monthly numismatic publication.


## History

*Coins* magazine was founded by Chester L. Krause in 1955 and was called *Coin Press*. Originally published in Iola, Wisconsin, by Krause Publications from 1955-2002, it was absorbed into F+W Media, which published the magazine from 2002-2019. In September 2019 it was acquired by Active Interest Media. Then the magazine became part of Active Interest Media's Home Group, based in Des Moines, Iowa.

Along with *COINage*, it was one of the top numismatic magazines by circulation, with 100,000 subscribers as of October 2009.

In May 2023, it was announced that *Coins* would cease publication effective with the June 2023 issue, bringing an end to its run.


## Content

Each issue featured articles related to coin and paper money collecting, numismatics, investing, the history of the hobby and of coins in general, as well as tips on collecting and a “coin finds” column, where readers could write to discuss any interesting coins found in circulation. In addition, the magazine featured several pages of coin values for coins of obsolete denominations such as the half cent, to modern coinage, as well as commemorative coins and proof sets. R.W. Julian was a regular contributor.

Each month, the magazine focused on specific coins or series, such as Barber dimes, or Susan B. Anthony dollars. In addition, it occasionally featured reviews of recent numismatic books, and a “market watch” column that tracked bullion values.
