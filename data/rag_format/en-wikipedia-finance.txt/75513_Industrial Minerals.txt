# Industrial Minerals



***Industrial Minerals*** (*IM*) publication is a specialist online service, supported by a monthly print magazine, covering all aspects of the non-metallic minerals industry, represented by its tagline: "from mine to market". It covers worldwide pricing, news, analysis and data on more than 70 minerals.


## History

*Industrial Minerals* was formed in 1967 as a spin-off from its parent publication, *Metal Bulletin* (*MB*), which had previously covered the industrial applications of mineral sands.

In 1995, *IM* launched *Mineral PriceWatch* (MPW) publication and *North American Minerals News*, a monthly newsletter which ceased in 2002.

Metal Bulletin PLC, owner of *Industrial Minerals*, was bought in 2006 by Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, owned by Daily Mail and General Trust for 221 million British Pounds (408 million dollars).
