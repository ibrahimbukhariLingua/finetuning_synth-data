***Wall Street Italia*** (WSI) is a leading independent website in Italy, specialized in business, financial, political news and analysis aimed to institutional and private investors. It is published by T.Mediahouse Srl.


## Description

*Wall Street Italia* is not a broker, consequently, it can be considered "market neutral" for private and institutional investors who are active in the global market. Furthermore, *WSI* has never received public contributions or subsidies of any kind (contrary to a common practice in Italy).


## History

Founded in New York in October 1999 by longtime financial journalist Luca Ciarrocca (who holds a degrees in law and a Master in Business Administration) Wall Street Italia went through all Internet cycles: boom, crisis, restructuring. In 2001 HdpNet, the media company controlled by RCS Media Group â€“ Corriere della Sera (the largest public media company in Italy) acquired 30,24% of WSI shares. After a "buy back" of RCS Media Group's shares and in spite of economic and financial crisis (the worst since the Great Depression), starting from 2008 WSI experienced a substantial increase in web traffic.
