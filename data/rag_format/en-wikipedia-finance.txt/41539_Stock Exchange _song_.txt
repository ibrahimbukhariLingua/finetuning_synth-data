Stock Exchange (song)


# Stock Exchange (song)



"**Stock Exchange**" is the third single from the duo Miss Kittin & The Hacker's debut album *First Album*.


## Writing and inspiration

Lyrically, "Stock Exchange" deals with the life of a high end Wall Street businesslady. The lyrics support this, including how the men "touch her bum in the lift of the Empire State [building]". And also the lyrics, "Is it real this pink punk costume I wear?
All the time to seduce Japanese 'hommes d'affaire' [English:businessmen]." She also has suicidal ideations as she sings that she is "dreaming of a hot bath, cutting my veins."


## Composition

"Stock Exchange" is credited as an electroclash song with disco and rave influences.


## Critical reception

Mark Beaumont of *NME* said that Miss Kittin "monotones like a German robot Cheeky Girl over some nifty "Vice City" disco, prompting a moral debate on whether its possible to sexually assualt [*sic*] a lift tannoy system."


## Cultural impact

"Stock Exchange" appeared on the mix albums *Fuck Me I'm Famous* by David Guetta, and *FabricLive.33* by Spank Rock.


## Music video

The music video for "Stock Exchange" was directed by Régis Brochier of 7th Floor Productions.


## Live performances

Miss Kittin performed "Stock Exchange" live at the Sónar festival and included it on her album *Live at Sónar*.
