Myanmar and the World Bank


# Myanmar and the World Bank



Myanmar is considered a lower-middle income state, and although there are areas in the country that are lagging there have been measurable improvements in terms of development since 2005. The World Bank's current strategy in Myanmar is to focus on rural development. Due to the conflict in the Rakhine area the World Bank Group (WBG) has increased its focus on social inclusion. Implementation of projects within Myanmar have increased access to electricity, schools, and healthcare. The current framework is laid out in the *Myanmar Country Partnership Framework 2015-2019*.

## IFC and MIGA Involvement


### IFC

As of May 2017 the IFC has a total commitment in Myanmar of 885M USD. The IFC is in the pursuit of three objectives within the Asian country: access to infrastructure, developing agriculture and tourism, and promoting financial inclusion. The IFC is also providing large amounts of advisory services. In April 2017 these services equated to US$32.1M. The focuses of these services include increasing the investment environment and implementing reforms to improve the business environment. As of 2017 there were not any non-performing loans in the IFC portfolio. The IFC has experience difficulties when working with the Myanmar government. Needed documents to ensure long-term private financed have not been received, and greatly limit the capacity of the IFC.


### MIGA

In 2017 MIGA had two active projects in telecommunication that created a total exposure of US$511.94M. The guarantee is in place to offer coverage for risks such as war and civil disturbances. The projects are speculated to greatly improve telecommunication infrastructure and allow further growth in the Myanmar economy. In 2017 MIGA was considering another guarantee in Myanmar, although this time focusing on electricity infrastructure. The IFC is also expected to contribute to this project if it gets approved. It is speculated that the project would offer significant employment, and off-set the extreme energy deficit that exists within the country.


## World Bank Group Response to Rohingya Displacement

On October 12, 2017, the World Bank Group posted a press release expressing their concern in regards to the violence and forced displacement that have been actively used against the Rohingya. They emphasize that the main focus of the projects will focus on improving education, health services, electricity, and ethnic/religion inclusion. International groups such as the UN are also heavily involved. The overall message is for the Myanmar regime to de-escalate the situation and allow displaced populations to return. In order to promote the well-being of the people within the Rakhine State the WBG is seeking opportunities to assist the government in implementing policies recommended by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. Before the implementations of any new projects conflict assessments are conducted. In order to support peace the World Bank has targeted conflict stricken areas: Increasing communities' access to service and opportunities. Furthermore, their strategy is to work with all stakeholders. At times this has also included armed ethnic groups.
