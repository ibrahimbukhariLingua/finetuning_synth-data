G. Wood, Son & Co.


# G. Wood, Son & Co.



**G. Wood, Son & Co.** was a major wholesale grocery business founded in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia, founded in 1876 by Gilbert Wood, his son Peter Wood, and James Gartrell.


## History

G. Wood, Son & Co. had its origin in a grocery store established by Gilbert Wood in Angas Street around 1855. He took on James Gartrell as clerk, then in 1876 established G. Wood, Son & Co. as a partnership of himself, his son Peter Wood, and Gartrell.

William Menz worked for the company around the 1860s, before going on to take over the grocery store founded by his mother.

Shortly after the death of Gilbert Wood in September 1886, South Australia experienced a depression brought about by a succession of poor seasons, the collapse of the Commercial Bank of South Australia and the Town and Country Bank. Many businesses folded, but by hard work and perseverance the company survived the crisis. After that the business became increasingly prosperous, and new and substantial premises were erected on North Terrace. Wood and Gartrell thereupon determined that they would thenceforth devote a percentage of their profits to charities and good works, considering they owed their good fortune to God.
