# Arch Capital Group



**Arch Capital Group Ltd.** (Arch Capital or ACGL) is a Bermuda-based public limited company which writes insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance on a worldwide basis, with a focus on specialty lines, the segment of the insurance industry where the more difficult and unusual risks are written. It has operations in Bermuda, the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and, in the case of mortgage insurance, Hong Kong.


## History

The company was founded in May 2000 by Robert Clements and Peter A. Appel, with Appel as President and CEO. The company's predecessor entity, Risk Capital Holdings had previously sold substantially all of the reinsurance operations of Risk Capital Reinsurance Co., its wholly owned subsidiary, to Folksamerica Reinsurance Co., and the surviving vehicle was the entity used to form Arch Capital.

Following the event of September 11, 2001, Arch Capital launched an underwriting initiative to address the global demand for insurance and reinsurance capacity.

In October 2001, Paul Ingrey joined the company to oversee its reinsurance operations and in January 2002, Dinos Iordanou was hired to run the company's insurance business. In 2003, Iordanou succeeded Appel as Arch Capital's President and CEO, and Arch Capital's current CEO, Marc Grandisson, replaced Iordanou in 2018.

Arch Capital entered the mortgage insurance business in 2015 with the formation of Arch Mortgage Guaranty and, in August 2016, it bought United Guaranty, AIGâ€˜s mortgage insurance unit, for US$3.4 billion, making the company the world's largest mortgage insurer.

In 2022, Arch Capital was added to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index, replacing Twitter (now X).

As of 2024, Arch employs nearly 7,000 people worldwide.
