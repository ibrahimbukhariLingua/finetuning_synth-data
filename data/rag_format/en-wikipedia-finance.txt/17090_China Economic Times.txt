## CCPPD banned *CET* reporter Pang Jiaoming

In October 2007, Pang Jiaoming (庞皎明), an investigative reporter of the *China Economic Times* was asked to be fired by the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party for publishing an embarrassing report on the state of China's railway infrastructure before the "sensitive" 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. Under pressure from the Central Propaganda Department, Pang was fired and banned from journalism. But, he later changed his name to "Shangguan Jiaoming" (上官敫铭) and entered the in-depth news department of the *Southern Metropolis Daily*.
