**Telekom Slovenije d.d.** (Slovene pronunciation: [ˈtéːlɛkɔm slɔˈʋèːnijɛ], "Telecom of Slovenia") is a telecommunications company based in Slovenia, with its headquarters in Ljubljana.


## History

In 1994 PTT Slovenija separated postal and telecommunication activities and transferred all telecommunication infrastructure to the newly founded Telekom Slovenije.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On August 31, 2013, it was announced that the Slovenian state intends to sell its 73 percent stake in Telekom Slovenije.

Slovenian Telekom owned and operated the TV channel Planet TV. In 2020 the channel was sold to the Hungarian media group TV2 Csoport owned by József Vida. Vida is close to the Hungarian ruling party Fidesz, which in turn has close political alliances with Prime Minister Janez Janša and the Serbian government led by Aleksandar Vučić. The sale to the Hungarians was also controversial because the media company United Group had submitted a better offer. United Group operates i.a. with channel N1 for Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the few independent news channels in the region.
