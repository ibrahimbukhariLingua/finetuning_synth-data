Alpiq


# Alpiq



**Alpiq** is an internationally active energy group headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland. The company was established in 2009 after the merger of *Atel Holding AG* (*Aare-Tessin AG für Elektrizität*) and *EOS S.A*. (Energie Ouest Suisse).

The energy group employs around 1221 people, is active in most European countries and is considered too big to fail in Switzerland.


## History

The company was formed in February 2009 from the merger of *Energie Ouest Suisse (EOS)* and *Aare-Tessin AG für Elektrizität (Atel).*

In 2010, Alpiq became the largest open market electric power trader in Romania, surpassing *Alro Slatina*, and gaining a 16% market share.

From 2012 to 2016, the company's revenue fell by more than half and Alpiq incurred heavy losses in the area of hydropower. Acting as a wholesaler, the company was affected by a price drop in the wholesale market. Furthermore, unlike other renewable energies, hydropower was not supported by the state. Alpiq therefore announced its intention to sell 49% of the hydropower plants in March 2016, but no buyer was found.

Alpiq tried to sell its Swiss nuclear power plants to *EDF* in 2016, as the production costs of the nuclear power plants were higher than the electricity prices at the time.

In March 2018, *Bouygues* acquired Alpiq's energy services business for over CHF 800 million. Following disagreements over the final adjustment amount, arbitration proceedings ensued. This was terminated in 2020 and Alpiq refunded over CHF 50 million to *Bouygues*.

Until 2019, Alpiq owned two coal-fired power stations in the Czech Republic until they were transferred to investor Pavel Tykač's *Seven Energy Group* at the end of August 2019, as Alpiq increasingly focused investments on renewable energies. Through the sale of the coal-fired power station, the company reduced its CO2 emissions by 60%.

At a media conference in early April 2019, Alpiq announced that *EDF* was selling its Alpiq shares. The consortium agreement, which was to be terminated in September 2020, ended early. By the end of May 2019, *EOS Holding* and *Primeo Energie* each took over half of the share package, financed by a mandatory convertible loan from Credit Suisse. The aim was to delist Alpiq shares from the Six Swiss Exchange by means of a squeeze-out, and to split Alpiq's share capital. The delisting application was approved by *Six Exchange Regulation* on 26 November 2019 and the delisting was set for 17 December 2019. On the last day on the stock exchange, the share price was approximately CHF 70.

Alpiq is a public limited company under the Swiss Code of Obligations, with its registered office in Lausanne. As the operator of several power plants, it is active in the fields of energy generation and energy trading. The three shareholder groups EOS Holding SA, Schweizer Kraftwerksbeteiligungs-AG and the consortium of Swiss minority shareholders each hold one third of Alpiq shares.

Alpiq is managed by the Board of Directors and the Executive Board.

#### Solar power plants

In 2022, Alpiq, together with the municipality of Gondo-Zwischbergen and Energie Electrique du Simplon, launched the Gondosolar project to install solar modules in Alpjerung near the municipality of Gondo. Alpiq is also involved in other projects for the installation of high-alpine photovoltaic systems, such as the Prafleuri and Grimentz Solaire projects. Alpiq operates several solar power plants in Switzerland, France, and Italy:

Alpiq is also involved in the development of new wind farms in Sweden. In December 2020, Alpiq and the Swiss company *Future Generation Renewable Energy (Fu-Gen)* concluded a co-ownership agreement for the Tormoseröd wind farm developed by Alpiq in south-west Sweden. Alpiq operates wind farms in Italy, France, and Switzerland:

## Environment and sustainability

In 2018, Alpiq generated an average of 298 grams of CO2 equivalents and 19 cubic millimeters of nuclear waste per kilowatt-hour. Alpiq was the worst performer among the largest energy companies, with an average of 347 environmental impact points (EIP). The sale of the last two coal-fired power plants in the Czech Republic in the same year reduced Alpiq's CO2 emissions scrap by 60%.

During the construction of the Nant de Drance pumped storage power plant, a total of CHF 22 million were invested in ecological compensation measures, in cooperation with WWF and Pro Natura. The measures included, above all, the restoration of wetland biotopes to enable the recolonization of endangered or rare animal and plant species.

Alpiq also operates a joint venture with the company Hydrospider, which uses an electrolysis plant at the Gösgen hydroelectric power plant to produce green hydrogen.

Alpiq is also committed to environmental protection at the company's own power plants. In rivers downstream of hydroelectric power plants, there is often a lack of bed load, which is considered the habitat of many aquatic creatures. To counteract the bed load deficit in the Aare downstream of the Ruppoldingen hydroelectric power plant and protect the habitat, Alpiq poured a total of 6,000 cubic meters of gravel into the river in 2021. The Ruppoldingen hydroelectric power plant is also *naturemade star* certified, the highest award for green electricity in Switzerland. For every kilowatt-hour sold from the power plant with proof of origin, money is paid into the Alpiq eco-fund. These funds are then used to support ecological upgrading and improvement measures. More than CHF 5 million have been invested in such measures, including revitalization measures on the Witibach in Grenchen and ecological upgrading on the Aare.
