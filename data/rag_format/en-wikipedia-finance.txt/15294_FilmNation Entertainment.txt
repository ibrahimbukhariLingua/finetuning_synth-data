## History


### 2008–2012: Founding

**FilmNation Entertainment** is an independent film production and distribution company co-founded in 2008 by Glen Basner and Steven Samuels. Initially, the company was a foreign sales firm, selling distribution right in various international markets.


### 2012–2018: Early growth

In 2012, FilmNation produced its first film, *Mud*, which competed at the Cannes Film Festival. On November 6, 2013, FilmNation Entertainment became part of the American Film Market for the first time. In December 2014, Village Roadshow invested $18 million for 33% stake in the company to make film production a regular part of operations. With growing success, the Los Angeles Times labeled FilmNation as "the emerging Oscar powerhouse you've never heard of."


### 2018–present: Expansion

In April 2018, FilmNation agreed to a $120 million revolving multi-bank credit facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and co-led by MUFG Union Bank. The funds would be used to give films larger budgets, take on additional films and enter the TV film, theater, digital and VR content markets plus other strategic investment areas.

In early 2019, FilmNation and Nordic Entertainment Group formed a television joint venture based in the United Kingdom that will operate under the FilmNation name. Nordic Entertainment Group will have first option on exclusive distribution rights to all of the joint venture's productions in the Nordic countries. FilmNation hired Kirstie Macdonald to spearhead the London division.
