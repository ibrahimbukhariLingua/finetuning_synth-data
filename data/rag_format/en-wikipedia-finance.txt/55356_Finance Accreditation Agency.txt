## FAA Accreditation Panelists

FAA Accreditation Panelists consist of local and international panel members who have specific roles such as to provide technical guidance and endorse accreditation for certification to verify whether a learning programme conforms to the learning criteria and industry requirements. These industry committee members and panelists represent a cross section of industry with external perspectives with regards to industry relevance and requirements.


## Scope of FAA Accreditation

Accreditation is the prevalent form of quality assurance internationally and is an established and recognised practice in ensuring quality of a learning programme, institution and competencies of an individual. Most importantly, accreditation assures industry, regulators and training providers that accredited learning programmes or institutions are trustworthy and reliable; and that accredited individuals are competent of their roles.

Hence all teaching, learning and all other related activities of a learning programme provided by the FSI training providers must meet the FAA Learning Criteria (FLC) and are in compliance with the FAA Quality Framework (FQF) as well as the FSI requirements.
