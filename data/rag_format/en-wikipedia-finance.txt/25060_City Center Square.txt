City Center Square


# City Center Square



**Lightwell Building** (formerly City Center Square) is a skyscraper in Downtown Kansas City, Missouri, built by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, in the Spring of 1977. It occupies the entire block of 11th Street to 12th Street, and from Main Street to Baltimore Street. Its tower is 30 stories tall, constructed with a reinforced concrete structure evident by the look of the exterior. It is the tenth-tallest habitable structure in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, and the fifteenth-tallest habitable structure in Missouri at 404 feet (123 m).

In 2003, the property was appraised at $38 million when Citigroup underwrote a $29 million loan. Net operating income was $3.1 million. As the real estate market rose, the property was re-appraised in February 2005 for $60 million and Ally Financial (formerly GMAC) underwrote a $44 million 10-year loan. This loan went delinquent in April 2010. An August 2010 appraisal estimated property value at $38 million, below the $41 million remaining principal.

City Center Square was renamed to the **Lightwell Building** in 2019.
