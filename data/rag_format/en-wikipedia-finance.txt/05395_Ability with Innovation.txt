## Founder

Abdul Mahdi Muslim Tahir Al-Juboori founded the Baghdad Company for Passengers and Goods Transportation in 1987. He was one of the company’s first shareholders and served as its first Chairman and CEO.


## Corporate history


### Early history

In 1970, Al-Juboori started his private business in Baghdad, Iraq, with a contracting license from the Iraqi Contracting Union. Throughout the 1970s, significant investments were made in infrastructure as revenue from oil poured in following the nationalization of the Iraqi Petroleum Company; this led to an increase in business. At that time, the government started focusing on technology, education, and major infrastructure projects.

From 1980 to 1988, as the Iran–Iraq War was happening, oil revenues were diverted to fuel the Iraqi Army, which put a strain on the economy. After that, Abdul Mahdi joined the army, and the company's business model shifted to investing in the stock market and renting heavy equipment to the Ministry of Housing and Construction.

In 1985, the Iraqi Contracting Union mandated that all contractors register with the Ministry of Trade and operate under a company license issued by the government. In compliance with this requirement, the Abdul Mahdi Muslim Company was established.

From 1991 to 2003, United Nations sanctions significantly slowed the Iraqi economy, which impacted the company’s construction activities. During this period, the company continued to trade in the Iraqi stock market and earned profits by collecting dividends from capital investments made over the preceding two decades.


### Recent history

In July 2005, Abather Al-Juboori, son of Al-Juboori, was appointed as the company's new CEO. The company expanded its market to new customers, including Fluor, Aim Group, and Spectrum Worldwide. Over the years, several companies emerged to support the requirements of the Government of Iraq, the U.S. Government, and commercial entities. These separate companies included Gruppo Cadini SRL, Spectrum Worldwide (joint venture), Caesar Trading & Construction, LLC, and FIC Consultants Engineering.

In September 2011, during Mr. Al-Juboori's time as CEO, all of the company’s subsidiaries were merged to form a single group, and the company name was changed to AWI – Ability with Innovation.
