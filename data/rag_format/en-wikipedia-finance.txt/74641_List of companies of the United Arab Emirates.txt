List of companies of the United Arab Emirates


# List of companies of the United Arab Emirates



The United Arab Emirates is a country at the southeast end of the Arabian Peninsula on the Persian Gulf.

The economy is the second largest in the Arab world (after Saudi Arabia), with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$570 billion (DH 2.1 trillion) in 2014. Though, the United Arab Emirates has been successfully diversifying its economy, the country remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. More than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on oil exports in 2009. While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy. In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.
