**KP Energy Limited** is an Indian wind energy company headquartered in Gujarat, India.


## History

KP Energy was incorporated in 2010. By 2012, it had secured an allotment of 56 lease spots for potential wind farms in Gujarat. Over time, the company expanded its operations through acquisitions and Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) with various partners to construct and manage power plants. In 2015, the company transitioned to a public entity and rebranded as K.P. Energy Limited. In 2018, KP Energy announced an agreement with GE India to establish a 300-megawatt (MW) wind power project in Kutch, Gujarat.

In 2019, KP Energy formed a partnership with CLP India, a major foreign investor in the Indian power sector, to develop a 250.8 MW wind project in Dwarka, Gujarat. This project was secured by CLP India through tranche VIII auctions conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). Earlier in June of the same year, CLP India and KP Energy had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the development of wind sites ranging from 50 MW to 300 MW.

In September 2022, the company entered into an agreement with Aditya Birla Renewables to develop wind projects in Bhungar and Fulsar, located in the Bhavnagar district of Gujarat. The company owns 8.4MW of wind energy and has recently commissioned a 10MW solar power project.

KP Energy commissioned a new 10.5 MW (Phase-V) ISTS-connected wind power plant in Devbhumi Dwarka, Gujarat, consisting of five 2.1 MW wind turbine units.


## Operations

Apart from the EPCC business, the company owns 8.4MW of wind energy and has recently commissioned a 10MW solar power project.
