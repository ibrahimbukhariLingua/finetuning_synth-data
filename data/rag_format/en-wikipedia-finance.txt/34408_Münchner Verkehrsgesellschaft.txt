## Services


### U-Bahn (Subway)

The U-Bahn, alongside the S-Bahn and Regional trains operated by the DB Regio Bayern, is the most important form of public transportation in Munich. In 2022 about 364 million passengers used it, in 2019 before the pandemic it was 615 million.
The U-Bahn network has been extended continuously until 2010 with the extension of the U3 to Moosach. Nowadays, multiple new extensions have been planned, some of them are already being constructed.

There are three different generations of U-Bahn trains currently in use, called MVG Class A, MVG Class B and MVG Class C. In total, 768 train cars are being used. At night, the U-Bahn does not operate to allow for repairs and cleaning work.

The MVG subway system is 95 kilometers big, and there are 100 stations of which 4 crossing stations are counted twice. The U-Bahn lines are named after the letter "U" followed by the number of the line (e.g. U3). Out of the 8 lines in total, 2 are amplifiers only driving at busy hours. All lines drive at least every 10 minutes, and meet with at least one other line in the center, creating three main lines (U1/U2/U7/U8, U3/U6 and U4/U5).

Excluding a section in Garching, the U-Bahn only drives within Munich downtown.


### Tramway

The MVG tramway is 82 kilometers big, of which 58 kilometers are on a separate tram-only route. In 2019 about 69 Million Passengers used it. Currently, the MVG possesses 132 low-floor streetcars.

Since 2018, there are nine lines driving throughout the day, as well as 4 amplifier lines and four nightlines, which just like the night busses have the letter "N" right before the line number. On the entire network, the trams drive at least every 10 minutes until 10 PM.

The tramway is lawfully privileged over cars and busses, which allows it to drive faster and meet its time requirements better. Outside of one section in Grünwald, the tram only drives within Munich downtown.


## MVG Museum

The MVG maintains a museum, located at Ständlerstraße 20 near the terminus of tram line 18. The museum contains a collection of some 25 historic trams, buses and utility vehicles from different eras. It opens to the public on alternate Sundays.
