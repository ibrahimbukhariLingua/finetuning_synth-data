# SkyValue



**SkyValue**, formally known as **SkyValue USA**, was a seasonal American low-cost airline that was headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and for the 2006–07 winter season, its only season of operations, operated from a hub at Gary/Chicago International Airport (GYY) in Gary, Indiana, which lies 25 miles southeast of the Chicago Loop.


## History

On October 13, 2006, Sky Value USA, part of C First Class Corp.brand, announced that it would begin flights on 737-800 aircraft beginning December from Gary/Chicago International Airport to five "sunny" locations offering 5 flights a day.. Service from December 15, 2006, to April 2007 was offered as a test run, with service to continue if it was proved successful. The winter season was extremely successful with over 10,000 passengers which made possible federal grants awarded to support the cost and expansion of the Gary Airport to become Chicago's "3rd" airport. SkyValue was operated as a "scheduled charter" service, with aircraft wet leased from Xtra Airways

The tour operator added a third weekly flight from its hub at Gary/Chicago International Airport to the airline's most popular destination, Mesa, Arizona which is located in the Phoenix area.

On April 27, 2007, SkyValue's CEO announced they would be ending service as planned to all destinations on May 6, 2007, and would consider providing the service for the next season.
