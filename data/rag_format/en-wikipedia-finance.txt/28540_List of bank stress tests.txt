# List of bank stress tests



A bank stress test is an analysis of a bank's ability to endure a hypothetical adverse economic scenario.
Stress tests became widely used after the 2008 financial crisis.


## Example

For example, in the U.S. in 2012, an adverse scenario used in stress testing was all of the following:

* Unemployment at 13 percent
* 50 percent drop in equity prices
* 21 percent decline in housing prices.

 * A private conference call was held with banks to notify them of a new, two part information release by the Fed
 + March 7, 2013 – Banks will be *privately* notified of the Fed's tentative decision on capital distribution plans.
 + Banks receiving a "no" will then have a 48 hours to *privately* resubmit to the Fed a reduced a distribution plan.
 + March 14, 2013 – the Fed will publicly disclose final decisions on requests for capital distributions
 + The week of private negotiations between the bank and the Fed will allow banks to adjust their request downward to what the Fed will allow. This was specifically designed to allow banks to avoid *"embarrassing capital-plan rejections"*
 + Shareholder lawsuits are expected if banks fail to disclose capital distribution plans and Fed rejections (even if labeled "informal") as the majority of shareholders and prospective shareholders regard bank dividend and share buyback plans, and limits, to be extremely material information.
 + Banks may not follow Fed advice and release capital distribution plans in advance of March 14.
