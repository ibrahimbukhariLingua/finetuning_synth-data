## History

Dual headquartered in London and New York City, Calypso Technology was founded in 1997 by Charles Marston and Kishore Bopardikar. It was acquired by private equity firms Bridgepoint and Summit Partners in June 2016. The company has over 20 offices in 18 countries. The company changed its name to Adenza in 2023.

Calypso's software is written entirely in Java and serves front office, middle office, and back office functions, allowing financial institutions to consolidate their infrastructure on a single platform. Their flagship product, Bank-in-a-Box, bundles the software with a Target Operating Model for the processing of all asset classes, as well as pre-configured business workflows and market best practices.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In June 2023, Nasdaq, Inc. announced that it had agreed to acquire Adenza in a $10.5 billion cash-and-stock deal, the biggest for the US exchange operator to date. The acquisition was completed in November.
