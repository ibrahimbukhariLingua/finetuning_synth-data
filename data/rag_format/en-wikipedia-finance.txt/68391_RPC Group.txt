## History

The company's origins lie in a plastic packaging production unit at Oakham established by a Danish group, Superfos, in 1973. The plant was acquired by Reed International in 1983 and was the subject of a management buyout as **R**eed**p**ack **C**ontainers in 1988, but was then bought by Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget in 1990. The business was then the subject of a management buyout from Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget in 1991. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1993. It went on to buy Continental Plastics Europe, with 12 sites across Europe, in 1997 and Wiko, an injection moulding business based in Germany, in July 2000. In December 2010 it bought Superfos Industries, its former parent, for about €240 million (£203 million).

In December 2013 the company acquired Maynard & Harris Plastics, a manufacturer of rigid plastic packaging, for £103.5 million and in May 2014 it bought Ace Corporation Holdings, a Chinese injection moulder, for up to $430 million. It then bought Promens, with 50 plants internationally, in a €386 million (£306 million) deal in December 2014.

For 2016, the company earned £2.75 billion, a two-thirds jump in revenue from the year before after a series of acquisitions. Among those acquisitions were the bottle-top maker GCS in France and British Polythene Industries.
