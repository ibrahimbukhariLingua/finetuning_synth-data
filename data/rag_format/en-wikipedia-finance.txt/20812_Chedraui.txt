## History

Chedraui was founded in 1927 in Xalapa, Veracruz, by Lebanese immigrant Lázaro Chedraui Chaya and his wife Ana Caram. They founded towards 1920 a haberdashery in the city of Xalapa, Veracruz. Originally the business was called the Port of Beirut, clearly showing its origin, but for 1927 would adopt the name *House Chedraui: the Only One to Trust*. In 1971 it opened the first supermarket in Xalapa, Veracruz. In 2005 it bought 29 supermarkets from Carrefour in Central and Southern Mexico. Chedraui's primary competition includes large grocers and hypermarkets such as Soriana, Walmart and Comercial Mexicana.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

According to Hoover's, it is "Mexico's third-largest retailer (after Walmart and Soriana), the supermarket giant sells groceries, apparel, and non-perishable items in 262 stores."

The California operations began in 1997, later expanded to Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The stores there are branded El Super, and operated by Grupo Chedraui's Bodega Latina Corporation, headquartered in Paramount, CA until in around 2023 or 2024. The headquarters has since been closed, and moved to Smart & Final headquarters in the city of Commerce. In 2018, Bodega Latina also acquired Fiesta Mart in Texas.

In 2022, Bodega Latina acquired the 250-store Smart and Final banner stores from Apollo Global Management. Following the acquisition, Bodega Latina changed its corporate name to Chedraui USA. Additionally, Smart&Final del Noroeste was created through a joint venture between S&F Mexico and Grupo Calimax. Smart & Final operates on a non-membership basis, allowing customers to shop without the need for a membership.
