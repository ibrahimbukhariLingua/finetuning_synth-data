# SunRice



**SunRice** is the consumer brand and trading name of **Ricegrowers Limited**, which is one of the largest rice food companies in the world and one of Australia's leading branded food exporters. In the 2023 Financial Year, the company recorded revenue of A$1.6 billion and Net Profit After Tax of A$54.8 million.

The SunRice Group comprises multiple businesses, assets and operations across Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, the United States, the Pacific Islands and Asia. It has around 35 major brands in approximately 50 global markets and employs over 2,000 people.

Australian rice production is based in regional southern New South Wales. The company's head office is located in Leeton (with a corporate office also in Sydney), and it has rice mills in Leeton, Deniliquin, and Coleambally. SunRice also operates stockfeed plants in Leeton, Tongala and Cobden.

In 2020, the SunRice Group celebrated its 70th anniversary. In the same year, its CopRice business converted the Coleambally Mill into a ruminant feed mill, the largest of its kind in Australia.

Today, the SunRice Group has operations across Australia, the USA, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, Japan, Jordan, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea.


## Products

SunRice manufactures more than 700 products - from table rice and rice flour, snacks and rice meals, to companion animal and livestock products.

Around 80% of the Australian crop is exported as branded product in an average year to key markets including Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East.

During the 2017 financial year, the Company experienced significant market share growth in the domestic Australian snack foods sector due to increasing sales of microwave rice meals.

To complement its Australian operations to ensure reliability of supply in low crop years, while enabling Riverina growers to focus on premium varieties that provide higher farm-gate returns, SunRice is establishing sustainable and secure global sourcing and supply chains. In 2016/17, SunRice sourced 320,000 paddy tonnes from Vietnam and has opened a representative office in the country.
