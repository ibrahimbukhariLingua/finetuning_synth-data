## History

Founded by Jean-Pierre Bansard in 1963 as the Bansard International Transportation Group, the company began by offering road transportation services within Europe. This later expanded to shipments by air, sea and rail, with the company providing full transport industry–type logistical services.

Bansard's clients are primarily in the business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors, with the company's shipping services handling textiles, cosmetics, automotive parts, alcoholic beverages and other goods.
