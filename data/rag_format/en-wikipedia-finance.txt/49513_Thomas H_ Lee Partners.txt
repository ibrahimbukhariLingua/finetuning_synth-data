## Refco

In 2004, THL completed a leveraged buyout acquisition of Refco, a financial services company specializing in commodities and futures contracts, which collapsed suddenly in October 2005 only months after its IPO. Refco's collapse cost investors more than $1 billion and sparked multiple suits for negligence against the firm. THL in turn sued Refco's auditors and former executives claiming they hid the fraud which caused Refco's collapse. THL has since settled all claims by Refco’s brokerage customers, bankruptcy trustee and shareholders.


## Art Van Bankruptcy

In March 2020, Art Van Furniture, a furniture retailer owned by THL, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company's going-out-of-business sales, approved two days before the filing, had to be suspended due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As a debtor-in-possession, Art Van could not prioritize paying employees over other creditors without a court order. To support the affected employees, THL established a 'Hardship Fund' and contributed an initial donation of $1 million. Additionally, THL pledged to match up to another $1 million in outside donations. In March 2021, THL fulfilled its matching commitment, leading to relief payments of approximately $1,200 per former Art Van employee.
