# List of companies of North Korea



North Korea is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. It claims sovereignty over South Korea. Over time North Korea has gradually distanced itself away from the world communist movement. *Juche*, an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into the constitution as a "creative application of Marxismâ€“Leninism" in 1972. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most services such as healthcare, housing, and food production are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered from a famine that resulted in the deaths of between 0.24 and 3.5 million people, and the country continues to struggle with food production. North Korea follows *Songun*, or "military-first" policy. It is the country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the United States, and India.

Due to the command economy of North Korea, there are relatively few companies in North Korea and they are all managed by the government.
