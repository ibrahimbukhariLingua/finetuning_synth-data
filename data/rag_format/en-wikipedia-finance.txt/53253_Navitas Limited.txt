# Navitas Limited



**Navitas** (also known as **Navitas Limited**, previously known as IBT Education) is an Australian owned for-profit private education services company, owning various private education providers internationally. It is the largest private non-university higher education provider in Australia.

Navitas made A$929.69 million in total sales in 2018, through its various subsidiaries and pathways programs in association with 11 public universities in Australia.


## History

Navitas was established in 1994, as *the Perth Institute of Business and Technology (PIBT).* The company was co-founded by Rod Jones and Dr Peter Larsen, as a joint venture with Edith Cowan University. Both founders had career backgrounds in education and education administration, and recognised a gap in the tertiary education sector, where international students, despite being equally capable as domestic students, were failing their courses due to lack of support. Following a partnership deal with a university in the United Kingdom in 2000, the company made its first international expansion. Four years onward, following success in this venture and the further establishment of pathways colleges, the company was listed publicly on the Australian Securities Exchange as **IBT Education**, being the first Australian education company to do so.

In 2005, as Australia's only private education company of its kind at the time, IBT Education acquired the largest private English language teaching (ELT) company in Australia, Australian Centre for Languages (ACL) Pty Ltd. for A$55.7m. Following shareholder approval, the company proceeded with a renaming in 2007, renaming itself from **IBT Education Limited**, to **Navitas Limited**, as well as rebranding its public operations to Navitas. Navitas expanded operations into the USA in 2010, through partnerships with the University of Massachusetts and Western Kentucky University. Responding to a favourable financial environment, Navitas moved on acquiring SAE Group, for A$294.3m, in 2011, its largest acquisition so far. Following further success, propelled by the growing international education industry, in 2014, Navitas entered the ASX 100. Subsequently, Forbes placed it 25th in their Most Innovative Growth Companies 2014 list. In 2017, the company launched Navitas Ventures, a corporate venture capital fund.


### Private equity takeover

In 2019, Navitas agreed to a buyout from a consortium of investors, following negotiation throughout 2018 and 2019, where Navitas rejected the initial offer. Following this, the shareholders were informed of the terms of the buyout, at A$5.825 per share (A$2.3 billion total). The investor consortium was led by private equity firm BGH Capital, also consisting of AustralianSuper and the company's founder Rod Jones. This marked the largest-ever acquisition by an Australian private equity firm, by gross value.

As of 2019, the ultimate parent of Navitas Limited is BGH Capital.

## Criticism


### Industry criticisms

For-profit private education has come under scrutiny in many industry journal reports, with Navitas, as Australia's biggest provider in the industry, commonly the subject of discussion.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

It is suggested by scholars that for-profit private education has several pitfalls. The for-profit model is said to compromise the quality of education, in favour of financial profit. However, the sector provides a pivotal part in many disadvantaged students lives, to provide a second chance, to those who did not have access to traditional tertiary education pathways.

The rapid growth of the private higher education (PHE) industry has been linked in many countries to employers’ changing workforce demands, to preferring workers who can quickly react to technological advancements. In Australia, the cause of this growth has been linked to the inability of the public education sector to accommodate the growing demand of international students.

The foundation of TEQSA in 2011 and subsequent funding towards public tertiary education providers, has further contributed to Navitas and the PHE industry's ability to grow in Australia.


### La Trobe Melbourne

Between April and June 2014, staff at Navitas owned La Trobe Melbourne partook in various strikes. This industrial action was in response to unreasonable negotiation of employment in regards to working conditions, job cuts and job security, between Navitas and the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU).

The working conditions being contested were the employer's usage of hot-desking and lack of staff space such as lockers. The job security concerns were in regards to more than 60 percent of the university's teaching staff being employed by casual contracts. In response to the strike, the university chancellor refused an open dialogue with the Union, and proceeded with the 350 job cuts.

Following the job cuts, the National Tertiary Education Union submitted an enquiry with the Fair Work Commission, requesting that the Commission assess their dispute with the La Trobe Melbourne (Navitas) enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA). The dispute details the NTEU's belief that Navitas had failed assess its need for casual staff, in the case that many staff employed casually should actually be under fixed-term or on-going contracts, as stated in the EBA. This type of employment is known as sham contracting. The Fair Work Commission expressed that it was not satisfied with Navitas' obligation to assess their casual employment contract validity. The Commission stated that all casual contracts must be re-assessed, and that Navitas must expedite this process, and work with NTEU to fulfil their obligation within the EBA.
