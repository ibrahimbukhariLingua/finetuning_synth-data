**Freightquote**, a C.H. Robinson company, is an online transportation broker of freight services throughout North America, based in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. Their business provides comparisons of shipping rates for national and regional freight carriers.


## Services

Freightquote developed a patented-technology platform to enable shippers to find competitive rates that can be compared for their freight shipments, similar to that which travel websites provide. Performed online, customers input freight shipment information online, review carrier options, choose a carrier, book shipments and pay for services. The company extends this platform through API connections. E-commerce websites integrate the company's technology to provide their customers with freight cost estimating and booking capabilities.


## History

Tim Barton founded Freightquote in August 1998.

In December 2006, Great Hill Partners signed a deal to acquire a minority interest in the company.


## C.H. Robinson acquisition

In early 2015, Freightquote was acquired by C.H. Robinson, a third-party logistics firm based in Eden Prairie, MN, specializing in logistics and supply chain services, including freight transportation. The acquisition connects C.H. Robinsonâ€™s global supply chain services with the strong e-commerce presence and customer base of Freightquote.
