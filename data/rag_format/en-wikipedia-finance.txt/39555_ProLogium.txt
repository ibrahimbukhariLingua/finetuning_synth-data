# ProLogium



Founded in 2006, **ProLogium Technology** (Mandarin: 輝能科技) is a Taiwanese solid-state battery developer and manufacturer.


## History

ProLogium Technologies was established in 2006. Its initial sales were of solid state batteries to automakers for testing and product development purposes.

In 2019 ProLogium signed cooperation agreements with several Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, including NIO, AiWAYS, and Enovate Motors.

In March 2021, ProLogium signed an MOU with Vietnamese car OEM Vinfast. According to the MOU, ProLogium and Vinfast will establish a joint venture to produce solid-state batteries for electric cars in Vietnam.

In March 2022 ProLogium and Gogoro released a prototype solid-state lithium ceramic battery for Gogoro's scooter charging network.

In February 2022, American business news website Insider reported on 15 notable unicorn companies in the global electric vehicle industry selected by Pitchbook, a financial research company, and ProLogium was included on the list.

In July 2022, ProLogium activated its expansion plan in Europe. By September 2022 they were said to have reduced their search to a shortlist including Germany, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland.

In May 2023, ProLogium announced that it would open a 5.2 billion euro primary international production center in Dunkirk at a ceremony headlined by French President Emmanuel Macron. ProLogium had also seriously explored locating the factory in Germany or The Netherlands. ProLogium executives said that France had beaten out Germany and The Netherlands by improving the deal they offered including by promising low priced power. Significant lobbying by the French side also came into play. All of the contenders had offered significant incentive packages including large tax credits. The ability to reliably source zero-carbon electricity was also a concern.


## Shareholders

Both Mercedes-Benz and VinFast own a portion of ProLogium. As of May 2023 ProLogium had raised US$700 million from investors. In return for their significant investment Mercedes-Benz received a seat on ProLogium's board of directors.

In 2022 POSCO has invested an undisclosed amount in ProLogium. Meanwhile, POSCO and ProLogium has signed an agreement on the joint development of components for ProLogium's solid-state batteries.

In 2021 ProLogium conducted a $326 million funding round with buy-in from Primavera Capital Group, and SoftBank China Venture Capital among others which placed the company's total valuation somewhere between $2-$3 billion.
