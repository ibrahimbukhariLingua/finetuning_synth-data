Mali Housing Bank


# Mali Housing Bank



**Mali Housing Bank** (fr *Banque de l'Habitat du Mali*) also known by the acronym BHM was a Malian mortgage institution that was a major actor in the Malian property sector from inception until its absorption by another bank. Founded in 1996, following a restructuring of a now defunct Postal and Savings Bank, BHM, persistently battled a weak balance sheet due to high ratio of non-performing loans, it was later merged with the stronger Mali Solidarity Bank (BMS) in 2016.


## History


### Challenges

Two years into its formation, the bank was embroiled in governance and inadequate capital challenges. In addition, there was a perception that loans disbursed by the bank were a form of government mortgage subsidy, ten years later, about three-quarters of its loans were non-performing. Many loans to housing developers did not result in completed projects and the firm was constrained by inadequate long term funding. In 2016, BHM merged with the Mali Solidarity Bank, a financial institution with a stronger balance sheet than BHM.
