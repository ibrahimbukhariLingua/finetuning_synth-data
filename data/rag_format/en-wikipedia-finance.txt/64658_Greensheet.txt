## History

*Greensheet* was a family-owned business, and print publication started in March 1970 in a small office at Kirby and Southwest Freeway, by Helen Gordon shortly after Gordon moved to Texas from Pittsburgh.

After successfully growing the business in the Houston area, the publication expanded. It opened its Dallas office in May 1977 and its Austin office in March 1978.

The company moved into its previous headquarters on 2601 Main Street in 1984.

In the fall of 1998, *Greensheet* built its initial press facility to save costs on printing its own publication, and moved its Harris presses there from its facility in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

In June 2005, the company brought a Goss Press to its operation. On December 28 of that year, it began printing the Houston versions of *The New York Times*, its largest off-set print customer to date.

In August 2018, Greensheet was sold to McElvy Media.

Helen semi-retired in 1994 and fully retired in 1995, leaving her daughter Kathy Douglass in charge of the company. In her retirement, she enjoyed creating oil portraits (she had been painting since she was young and was quite accomplished). She also continued playing the piano, which she took great pleasure in. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
