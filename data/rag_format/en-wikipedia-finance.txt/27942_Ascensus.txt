In 2013, Ascensus acquired Upromise Investments, Sallie Mae's 529 college savings plan administrator. This resulted in the formation of its government savings division. The company also manages Ugift, its third-party giving program allowing family and friends to transfer money into 529 plans.

In 2016, Ascensus College Savings partnered with Wealthfront, an automated investment service, to provide the state of Nevada with a 529 savings plan. This marks the first plan of this type to use an automated investment service.

Ascensus administers the ReadySave 529 app, which is used by State governments to enable families to manage their 529 education savings accounts.


### Savings for individuals with disabilities

In February 2017, Illinois announced a 14-state partnership program, the National Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Alliance, the nation's largest multi-state agreement, that encourages residents to make investments to help disabled or blind citizens save for the future. Ascensus, through their Government Savings division, is administering the program.
