## Politics and government

Mr. MacDougal chaired the Illinois Governor’s Task Force for Human Services Reform from 1993 to 1997, which developed and implemented a major reorganization of the Illinois human services systems to better integrate services, connect with communities and measure outcomes with the overreaching goal of helping people move from dependency to self sufficiency. An integrated Illinois Department of Human Services was created from the six separate uncoordinated departments. Upon signing the bill, Governor Edgar described it as the "biggest reorganization of state government since 1900". Illinois then led the nation by reducing welfare roles 95% in the subsequent 10 years (from August 1996 to September 2016) with most going to work. This work has been described in columns by Pulitzer Prize winners David Broder and Clarence Page.

In early 1988, Mr. MacDougal joined the Bush Presidential Campaign. MacDougal was subsequently was appointed by then Vice President George H. W. Bush as assistant campaign manager and senior advisor, where he had responsibility in the areas of management, policy and finance.

Baker III* (Anchor Books, 2021) pp. 295–296.

MacDougal was an exploratory candidate for the US Senate from Illinois in 1989, withdrawing at the request of President Bush, and was also a US Senate candidate in 1992 where, according to a book by NY Times journalists Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, MacDougal’s candidacy was sacrificed by the White House in return for a crucial vote by his opponent, Illinois Senator Alan Dixon (D-IL), to approve Clarence Thomas for the US Supreme Court.

Mr. MacDougal was appointed by President George H.W. Bush as a public delegate of the United States to the United Nations for the 44th General Assembly session where, among other responsibilities, he served as liaison to the East Bloc countries. The U.S. Senate confirmed him on November 19, 1989. President Bush subsequently appointed MacDougal to the US Commission on Improving the Effectiveness of the United Nations. He also served on the US secretary of labor’s Commission on Workforce Quality and Labor Market Efficiency.

In November 1991, after the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain came down, Mr. MacDougal was chosen by President George H.W. Bush to be chairman of the $55 million Bulgarian American Enterprise Fund (BAEF), established to invest in and encourage entrepreneurship and free markets in Bulgaria. Mr. MacDougal had previously been the first "free market" speaker at the Karl Marx University (now the University of National and World Economy) in Sofia resulting from his work at the United Nations. The BAEF created thousands of jobs for Bulgarians, opened up new markets, and grew at a rate in excess of 17% per year to a value of more than $450 million.

Mr. MacDougal is currently founder and chairman emeritus of the America for Bulgaria Foundation (www.us4bg.org), which assumed the BAEF assets. The ABF, based in Chicago and Sofia, has a mission of strengthening U.S. Bulgaria relations and continuing to help Bulgaria move to a free market economy through grants strengthening Roma education; anti-corruption efforts and employment initiatives, among other activities.
