BAE Systems Electronic Systems


# BAE Systems Electronic Systems



**BAE Systems Electronic Systems** (**ES**) is one of three operating groups of BAE Systems Inc., the North American subsidiary of the British global defence contractor BAE Systems PLC.


## History

BAE Systems acquired **Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems** (AES) and **Lockheed Martin Control Systems** in 2000.

BAE Systems Electronic Systems was formed in June 2005 by an internal reorganisation of these businesses.

Lockheed had identified AES as a candidate for disposal following a strategic review in 1999. BAE Systems agreed to acquire the group in July and completed its acquisition of AES on 27 November 2000. The group encompassed Sanders Associates, Fairchild Systems and Lockheed Martin Space Electronics & Communications. The purchase of this group by BAE has been described as "precedent setting" given the advanced and classified nature of many of that company's products.

In August 2004 BAE acquired **Boeing Commercial Electronics** for $66 million (Â£36m). This was an Irving, Texas-based division of Boeing responsible for the manufacture of electronic components for the company's aircraft. Boeing announced the sale of the division in 2003 as part of a move to outsource component manufacture and "concentrate on the integration and final assembly of commercial aircraft." *The Fort Worth Star Telegram* said "Boeing has sought to sell several operations that it said are too narrowly focused and costly for the company to manage efficiently."
