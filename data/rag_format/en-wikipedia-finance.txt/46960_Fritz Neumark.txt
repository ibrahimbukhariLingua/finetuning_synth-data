## Early life

He was born in 1900. As he was Jewish-German, he emigrated to Istanbul (Turkey) in 1933, to avoid the Third Reich. He later moved back to Germany, and served two terms as Rector of the Goethe University Frankfurt (1954–1955 and 1961–1962).

The Fiscal and Financial Committee set up by the European Commission in 1960 under the chairmanship of Professor Neumark made its priority objective the elimination of distortions to competition caused by disparities in national indirect tax systems: Following publication of the Neumark Committee Report in 1962, it was recommended that a value-added tax, as used in France, be adopted across the European Economic Community.
