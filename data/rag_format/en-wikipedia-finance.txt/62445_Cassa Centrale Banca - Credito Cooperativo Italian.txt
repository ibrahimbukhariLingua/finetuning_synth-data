# Cassa Centrale Banca - Credito Cooperativo Italiano



**Cassa Centrale Banca - Credito Cooperativo del Nord Est S.p.A.** is a coordinating institute of the cooperative banks (rural credit unions) of Trentino, based in Trento, Trentino, Italy. Some cooperative banks (rural credit unions) of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia are also members.

Cassa Centrale Banca has been designated in 2019 as a Significant Institution under the criteria of European Banking Supervision, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.


## History

In 2017 the central institution applied to be one of the central banks for proposed co-operative banking groups of whole Italy. The other candidate was ICCREA Banca (and Raiffeisen Landesbank Südtirol – Cassa Centrale Raiffeisen dell'Alto Adige for South Tyrol autonomous province only). A new Italian law required all co-operative banks of Italy to join a banking group, which the central institution has power to recapitalize individual member banks, but the central institution itself would be owned by the member banks in a majority. Cassa Centrale Banca - Credito Cooperativo del Nord Est had proposed to change their name to Cassa Centrale Banca – Credito Cooperativo Italiano.


## Joint ventures

Cassa Centrale Banca had a joint venture "Casse Rurali – Raiffeisen Finanziaria" with its South Tyrol counterpart. The joint venture was the largest shareholder of Investitionsbank – Mediocredito of South Tyrol - Trentino autonomous region.

Cassa Centrale Banca had another joint venture Nord Est Asset Management S.A. (NEAM in short).


## Shareholders

The bank was owned by the member banks directly. However, in order to sell 25% shares to DZ Bank, a new holding company **Centrale Finanziaria del Nord Est** was established in 2007, in order for the member banks to have a controlling influence in the central institute.
