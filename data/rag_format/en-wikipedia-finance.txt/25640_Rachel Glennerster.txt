## Research

Glennerster's areas of research includes and focuses on randomized trials of health, education, microcredit, women’s empowerment, and governance. Geographically, her research has spanned West Africa and South Asia, including countries such as Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.

Findings of her research include:

* Community-driven development programs, a popular strategy for foreign aid donors, have a positive short-run effect on local public goods provision and economic outcomes, but little effect on sustained improvements in collective action and inclusion of marginalized groups. This evidence is based on randomized allocation of community-driven development programs across regions in Sierra Leone (with Katherine Casey and Edward Miguel).
* A randomized evaluation on the impact of microfinance in India showed that microcredit group-based lending had little impact on consumption, health, education, women's empowerment, average business profits, starting a new business, and on average monthly expenditure per capita. Yet positive effects were found on durable goods expenditure and business investments (with Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Cynthia Kinnan).
* In a research of behavioral economics of complying with tuberculosis medication in Pakistan, researches measured the impact of daily SMS medication reminders of treatment outcomes to patients of tuberculosis. No impact was found between the SMS messages and patients' self-reported adherence to treatment regimes, physical health, and psychological health. This research was conducted with Aamir Khan and Shama Mohammed.
* In a 2023 study, she estimated the global losses from pandemics to be over $800 billion annually.

## Books

Glennerster is the coauthor of *Running Randomized Evaluations*, a book on running randomized impact evaluations in practice in developing countries, and *Strong Medicine: Creating Incentives for Pharmaceutical Research on Neglected Diseases*, a book that strategizes incentives for developers to undertake the costly research needed to develop vaccines.
