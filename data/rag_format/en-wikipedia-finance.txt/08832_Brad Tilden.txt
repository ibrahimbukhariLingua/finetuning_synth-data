## Early life and education

Tilden was born in Houston, Texas in 1960. His family moved to Seattle where he attended Sylvester Middle School in Burien. Seeing his first Boeing 727 on a field trip sparked Tilden's love of airplanes. After graduating from Highline High School in 1979, Tilden enrolled at Pacific Lutheran University, during which time he worked as a dishwasher aboard Amtrak trains to pay tuition. Tilden became interested in business and earned a degree in business administration and accounting. During this time, Tilden earned his private pilot license. In 1997, he earned an executive master's degree in business administration from the University of Washington.


## Career

Following graduation from college, Tilden worked for eight years at the accounting firm PwC (then called Price Waterhouse) in Seattle and Melbourne. Alaska Airlines hired Tilden in 1991 to the accounting division and three years later named him as corporate controller of the company.

After serving as the company's chief financial officer and executive vice president of finance, Tilden became chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group in 2012, replacing Bill Ayer. During his leadership, Tilden oversaw the Alaska Airlinesâ€™ acquisition of Virgin America, a combination of airlines that was recognized by the FAA as a uniquely fast process. Maintaining Alaska's reputation as an industry leader in sustainability, the International Council on Clean Transportation named the airline to be the most fuel-efficient domestic carrier during Tilden's first five years as CEO.

*Fortune* named Tilden one of its Businesspeople of the Year in 2016. He was inducted into the International Air and Space Hall of Fame in 2018. He retired in March 2021.


## Philanthropy

Tilden is a longtime advocate for education and youth career development. Each year, Tilden and his family support a college scholarship through the Highline Schools Foundation and, in 2014, led efforts to secure a bond to build two new schools in the Highline School District. He is also a major proponent of Aviation Day, which Alaska Airlines hosts to teach youths about career opportunities in the aviation industry, and an early supporter of Raisbeck Aviation High School at the Museum of Flight.
Tilden and Alaska Airlines host an annual scholarship celebration with Highline Public Schools students and Russell Wilson. During his time on the Chief Seattle Council of Boy Scouts of America, Tilden called for the organization to accept openly gay scouts.

Tilden is currently serving as National Chair of Scouting America, and he is a board member of the Washington Roundtable, Nordstrom, and the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce (which he formerly chaired).
