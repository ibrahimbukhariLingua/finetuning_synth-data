Art is a Business


# Art is a Business



***Art is a Business*** (Russian: Иску́сство — это́ би́знес, romanized: *Iskússtvo—etó bíznes*) is a conceptual project by the artist Alexey Parygin, realized in the first half of the 2000s. *Art is a Business* is the artist’s second philosophical manifesto, after *Contemplation of Money*.


## History

The art project was based on the *312/20* performance publicly shown on January 21, 2001 in the performance program at the Petersburg Festival in the Manege Central Exhibition Hall (Saint Petersburg).

In the authentic version, the performance text chanted for twenty minutes in two voices (high female and low male) consisted of three hundred and twelve rhythmically repeating verses turning into a looped Dadaist mantra.

> The process was designed like that: my performance partner and I were standing opposite each other at a distance of about three meters. While reading the text, with arms straight up and slightly apart (palms outward), we gradually raised our arms in a stylized gesture of a traditional intercessory prayer iconographically referring to the classical image of the Virgin Hodegetria. The incense was burning. A whitish trickle of sweet smoke was slowly stretching towards the ceiling, emphasizing the sacredness of the two-voiced hosanna repeated over and over again: Art is a Business; Business is an Art. Art is a Business; Business is an Art. Art is a Business; Business is an Art; Art is a Business; Business is an Art.... A rhythmic, monotonous sound.

This endless repetition made the reasonable formula meaningless, gradually turning it into a simple sequence of sounds, depriving it of any specific speculative sense. The verbal leitmotif changed the performance direction initially stated as an absolute given. Slogan and march were replaced with psychedelic rap. *Art is business*, but becoming utilitarian and flat, commercial and applicable, it, like a phoenix destroying itself with fire, is able to rise from the ashes, melt down and be reborn into something completely different, filled with new living energy.

By means of art, the *Contemplation of Money* and *Art is a Business* projects portrayed money as a New Divine Essence.
