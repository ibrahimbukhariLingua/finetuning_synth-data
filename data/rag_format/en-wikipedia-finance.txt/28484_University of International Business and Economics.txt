## Foreign students

UIBE was one of the first Chinese universities to admit foreign students, with the first group enrolling in 1954.

Over 70% of the foreign student population hails from the Republic of Korea (South Korea). Students from the DPRK, (North Korea), however, despite that country's proximity to China, are very rare. Recently, there has been an influx of Western European (Finland, France, Germany, Italy) and North American students. Japanese, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Thai students also account for a sizable proportion of foreign students.

Since 1998, the UIBE and Reims Management School have created a Franco-Chinese undergraduate program CESEM. It also has an exchange agreement for Spanish students with the Comillas Pontifical University. Other dual diplomas partners are Paris-based business school ESCE and Cardiff University.

UIBE is one of the first universities in China to launch an international student program taught entirely in English. This program has become very popular among foreign students both in China and outside.
