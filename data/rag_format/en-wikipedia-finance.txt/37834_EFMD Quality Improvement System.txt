EFMD Quality Improvement System


# EFMD Quality Improvement System



The **EFMD Quality Improvement System** (**EQUIS**) is a business school accreditation managed by Brussels based EFMD. It provides accreditation for higher education institutions of management and business administration and is run by the European Foundation for Management Development. It is considered as one of the triple accreditation.

EQUIS has accredited 210 institutions in 45 countries around the world. In 2022, Equis suspended all higher education institutions in Russia from its ranking.


## History

EQUIS' directors in 2018 were Ulrich Hommel and David Asch. As of 2022, the EQUIS director is Alfons Sauquet. In the past 20 years of existence, the organization has accredited 189 institutions in 45 countries.


## Object of the accreditation

The accreditation is awarded to business schools based on general quality. The process also takes into account the business school's level of internationalization, which is not a strict requirement for accreditation by the other two major international accreditation bodies: AACSB and AMBA. As of 2014, all fully accredited EQUIS business schools applying for AACSB accreditation have succeeded, which has not been the case the other way.

EQUIS accreditation can be granted for three years (with annual progress reports on the areas of improvement required) or for five years (with a mid-term progress report on development objectives required).
