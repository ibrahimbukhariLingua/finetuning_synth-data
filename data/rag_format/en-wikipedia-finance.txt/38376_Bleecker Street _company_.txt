# Bleecker Street (company)



**Bleecker Street Media LLC** is an independent American film company that specializes in film distribution. The company is based in New York City and named after 65 Bleecker Street, the street address of founder Andrew Karpen's prior company Focus Features. Founded in 2014, the studio was established with the goal to distribute "smart house" films that combine the entertainment of studio blockbusters with the artistic indie allure.


## History

Bleecker Street was formed in August 2014 by CEO Andrew Karpen, who is the former co-CEO of Focus Features. It was launched with backing from Manoj Bhargava. With the announcement of the company's formation, Bleecker had indicated an exclusive U.S. distribution output deal with Shivani Rawat's ShivHans Pictures, effective immediately. Initial plans have the distributor releasing three to five pictures in 2015 and expanding from there. Karpen hired four former Focus Feature employees as presidents in September 2014. At the September 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, Bleecker Street made its first film deal for *Pawn Sacrifice'*s North American rights. In the years following, Bleecker Street received Oscar Nominations for their films *Trumbo (2015)* and *Captain Fantastic (2016).*

Bleecker Street focused on primarily theatrical releases and quickly established itself as a player on the indie-film scene with their titles such as Steven Soderbergh's *Logan Lucky* and Eye in the Sky, the biggest arthouse release of 2016 starring Helen Mirren. Also starring Helen Mirren in the lead role, Bleecker Street distributed *Golda* in 2023, receiving another Oscar nomination.
