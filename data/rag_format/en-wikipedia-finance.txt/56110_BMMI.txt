## History

In 1883 Gray Paul, a British-owned merchant company operating in the Persian Gulf, established a local branch in Bahrain. Following a merger in 1936, the company was renamed Gray Mackenzie & Co. Limited, and in 1955 it became part of the Inchcape Group.

In 1980, the group formed a joint venture with Bahraini shareholders to form Bahrain Maritime & Mercantile International (BMMI). The new company was later listed on the Bahrain Stock Exchange. When Inchcape divested its shareholding in 1999, BMMI became a wholly Bahraini-owned public shareholding company. In 2003, the group widened its shareholding base to investors across the GCC. In 2010 the company legally changed its name from Bahrain Maritime and Mercantile International to just the acronym BMMI.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
