## Name

The company was renamed from Alltrista in May 2002. Martin E. Franklin joined the company in 2001, Franklin decided to change the name of the company to something that represented the company's heritage, and future. Martin Franklin conceived the Jarden name by combining the heritage of the Ball Mason Jar ("Jar") with the concept of products being used in the home (the "den"). "Jarden" also invokes the French word for garden (jardin), since the company planned to expand its product range outside the home.
