## History

In 1975, after graduating from college, David Meyer joined the Case Corporation as a product specialist for 4WD tractors. In November of the same year, he began working for the Case dealership *Meyer-Jones Farm Store* in Wahpeton, North Dakota. In 1976, Meyer and his business partner Darrell Larson became minority shareholders in the company. In September 1977 Larson and Meyer opened a second dealership in Lisbon, North Dakota.

Titan Machinery was founded in 1980 when Meyer and Larson bought out the majority shareholders of *Meyer-Jones Farm Store.* Darrell Larson left Titan at the end of the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the company began its expansion with acquisitions in La Moure, North Dakota, and Lidgerwood, North Dakota. By 2003, Titan had grown to 13 dealerships after a merger with *C.I. Farm Power*. Peter and Tony Christianson, owners of *C.I. Farm Power*, joined Titan Machinery's management. In December 2007 Titan Machinery was taken public with 34 dealerships and US$300 million in revenue at the time.

In late 2011 Titan Machinery expanded into Eastern Europe with its purchase of two Case IH dealerships in Bucharest and Timișoara, Romania. In February 2012 the company acquired seven dealerships in Bulgaria and one dealership in Serbia in December 2012.

After receiving approval from CNH Industrial, Titan Machinery opened its first dealership in Vinnitsa, Ukraine on February 18, 2014.

Following declining revenue in its agricultural equipment business, Titan closed 3 stores in South Dakota and Wyoming in March 2015 and reduced its workforce by 14% through layoffs, store closings and open positions not being filled.
