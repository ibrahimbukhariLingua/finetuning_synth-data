## History

The bank was founded in 1966.

Due to the bank's ethic sustainability orientation, numerous customers from the charitable-foundations-field have joined the bank since then. The cooperative does not provide services to companies that are solely profit oriented.

Since 2006, the bank offered loans worldwide to microfinance institutions.
