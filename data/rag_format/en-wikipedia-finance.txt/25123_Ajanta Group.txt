In 2008, the company unsuccessfully tried to enter the automotive industry with the Oreva Super, a low-cost electric car. It was dubbed "Tata Nano-Killer," reportedly costing less than INRÂ 100,000 or roughly around $1,400.

## Controversies

In 2022, the company and its staff were investigated for the collapse of a bridge in Morbi. The Municipality of Morbi owned the bridge, and entered into a 15-year maintenance agreement with Oreva Group. Initial reports say that the bridge opened to the public ahead of schedule after temporary repairs, even though no 'certificate of fitness' from the local authorities had been obtained.
