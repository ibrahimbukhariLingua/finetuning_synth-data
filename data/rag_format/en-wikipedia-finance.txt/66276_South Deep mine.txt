## Environment, Social & Corporate Governance

South Deep Mine has experienced a challenging period over recent years with various steps taken to revise its cost base in order to reduce losses (of approximately US$292m over a five-year period). In August 2019 a material restructuring of the mine was announced with the primary aim being to reduce costs by way of cutting 1,100 employees and 460 contractors.

In response to the retrenchment announcements, the National Union of Mineworkers branch at South Deep started strike action. The strike lasted for 45 days from 2 November 2018 and was ended following a settlement agreement between Gold Fields and the National Union of Mineworkers.
