## History

Scottish Building Society was established in 1848 as the Edinburgh Friendly Property Investment Company. It changed its name to the Scottish Building Society in 1929.

On 1 February 2013, the Scottish Building Society merged with its Edinburgh competitor Century Building Society. As a result of the merger, it became the only remaining building society to be headquartered in Scotland.

In 2023 it celebrated its 175th anniversary. As part of the 175th anniversary celebrations, the Society launched the Scottish Building Society Foundation in partnership with Foundation Scotland. To date, 17 charities across Scotland have received awards, totalling almost £60,000 towards local causes.
