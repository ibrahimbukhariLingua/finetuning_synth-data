## Career

Tommasini started his career for transport & removal company AGS by launching subsidiaries in Africa and Eastern Europe, specifically managing and developing the Romanian subsidiary in Bucharest during 1995 through 1996. In 1996 he took the position of Deputy to CEO of property manager Bazin S.A. in Paris.

Then in 1997, he joined Jean-Francois Ott at Orco Property Group in Prague and was responsible for the international development of the company.

In 2000 he developed and headed Orco Budapest and participated in the listing of Orco Property Group in Paris.

In the following years Tommasini and Ott founded the hotel group MaMaison Hotels & Residences which was developed across Central and Eastern Europe. This process spearheaded Orco's international development most notably in Warsaw (2002), Bratislava (2003), and Moscow (2006).

Beginning in 2004 Tommasini and Ott developed Orco in Germany starting by acquiring one asset at a time. They continued this process until they managed over 20 income producing assets in Berlin, specifically in the district of Prenzlaur Berg. Later this developed into the privatization of GSG Berlin in 2006 which changed the profile of Orco Property Group by refocusing it towards Germany.

In 2005 Tommasini was appointed to a Member of the Board at Orco Property Group. By 2009 Tommasini was Deputy CEO and Group CFO overlooking all financial functions, financial reporting, and the financial restructuring of the Group. The climax came with the negotiated EUR 600 million bond equitization finalized in 2013. As a result of this restructuring Tommasini became the COO and MD of Orco Germany, focusing on asset management and development of GSG Berlin along with Orco's main projects.

In 2014 Tommasini left Orco Property Group and founded O&T Partners with Jean-Francois Ott, investors in both real estate and venture capital.

In 2018, he bought the estate Domaine de la Thibaudière west of Paris region which he refurbished and with partner Geoffroy Perdon, opened as an event venue in 2019. Its initial commercial success and the challenging but stimulating time of covid crisis, convinced Tommasini to focus time and investments on this under-structured segment of countryside event venues for both private and corporate events through the creation of Domaines & événements.

Tommasini and his children own TOMSAFE SAS, his top holding company, gathering interests in Groupe Domaines & événements, family businesses SIENNE, Dubois Promotion,Groupe TOMMASINI, and various private equity and venture capital interests.

Tommasini is responsible for risk management, investment execution, asset management, and development supervising in Prague, Berlin, and Paris.
