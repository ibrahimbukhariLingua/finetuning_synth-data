In June 2003, Coronation Fund Managers was listed separately on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) after it was unbundled from Coronation Holdings with a total staff complement of 133. It became the firstᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ asset manager in South Africa to gain Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPSTM) compliance.ᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

## Stewardship

Coronation was an early signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing in 2007. The business was also an early adopter of the Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (2012) and the UK Stewardship Code (2010) [10]. The business incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its investment decision-making process in a way that is fully consistent with their long-term investment horizon.

Coronation believes companies cannot achieve sustainable economic success while neglecting their social and environmental responsibilities. Social responsibility has the potential to increase the quality of a company's earnings stream and consequently its long-term investment potential. For Coronation, ESG issues form an intrinsic part of the mosaic for any investment case. Poor ESG performance may not necessarily exclude investing in a company, but it does force them to carefully consider the issues and engage management on these factors.

Coronation furthermore recognises the importance of focusing its attention and time on those ESG issues where it has expertise, and that can have the most meaningful impact on a company's long-term prospects. To this end, Coronation spends large amounts of time studying the corporate governance of the companies they invest in. Coronation engages extensively with management and the board where needed.


## Transformation

As a South African company, Coronation is committed to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE). Coronation's approach to transformation is based on the ideal that people are their greatest asset. This is reflected in their choice of a B-BBEE partner, the Imvula Trust, of which the beneficiaries comprise all black staff. Imvula was created in April 2005 and on 28 February 2013 acquired a direct ownership of 10% in the listed Coronation business.

In terms of their procurement processes, Coronation applies strict consideration rules in order to create the opportunity for enhanced economic activity.
