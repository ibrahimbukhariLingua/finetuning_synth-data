## Business Model

BESTSECRET's works as a closed shopping community. This means that the offers are only available to registered members and these members have access to a selection of permanently reduced designer merchandise. In order to maintain this pricing policy and yet protect the exclusivity of the brands, access to the online store is limited to 250,000 members. A prospective user must be recommended by an existing member to gain access. However, the COO, Marian Schikora, will review any new recommendation to ensure that the total number of members is kept low (for example, only a limited number of people per region can become members).ᶠᵃⁱˡᵉᵈ ᵛᵉʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ

## Cargo Container Hardwood Beetle Incident

In 2016, there was one incident in which nine employees were injured and another 51 had to seek medical treatment. The cause was traced back to two containers from China, which were provided with means that were intended to prevent the import of Asian longhorn beetle. Employees complained of airborne contaminants that caused irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The product in question was returned. The warehouse was put back into service the following day. Daniel Schustermann promised to introduce stricter security measures in the future to protect employees.
