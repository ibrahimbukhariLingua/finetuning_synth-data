# Peter Harrison (businessman)



**Peter Harrison** (born 1966) is a British businessman, and the chief executive (CEO) of Schroders, a British multinational investment management company.


## Early life and Education

Peter Harrison was born in Cheshire on 25 May 1966 to Stanley G. Harrison and his wife Jennifer L. nee Harrow, who were married in Bucklow, Cheshire, in Q1 1963. He has a sister Sally, born Q4 1968.

Harrison studied at the University of Bath, graduating in 1988 with a degree in business administration.


## Career

Harrison began his career at Schroders as a graduate in 1988, before moving to Newton Investment Management in 1991. Prior to returning to Schroders in 2013 as global head of equities, Harrison worked in a number of senior roles at JPMorgan, Deutsche Asset Management and latterly chairman and CEO of RWC Partners. He became head of investment at Schroders in 2014 and then CEO in 2016, when he succeeded Michael Dobson, who had been CEO for 15 years and became the chairman. Dobson's move from CEO to chairman was widely criticised, for example in *The Independent*, "City in uproar as Schroders tycoons flout the rules on good governance".

Harrison faced controversy in April 2020 when Schroders announced it would pay him £9 million, an increase of 39% on his salary the previous year. It was announced in the midst of the coronavirus lockdown, while Schroders was urging companies to keep executive pay under control. Harrison responded to the controversy by pledging to donate a portion of his salary and bonus for the year 2020 to charity. Schroders further responded by introducing a collective action scheme, encouraging its employees to do the same.
