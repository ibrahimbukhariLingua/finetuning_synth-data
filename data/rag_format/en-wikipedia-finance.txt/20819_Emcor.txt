## History

In 1994, Jamaica Water Properties filed for bankruptcy after making making acquisitions unrelated to its core business and incurring significant debt. Frank MacInnis became CEO of the company, sold many of the businesses and renamed the remaining company as Emcor. The company also added facilities management services to provide a steady revenue stream.

As of 2001, since the restructuring was completed in December 1994, the company had realized 27 consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue growth.

McInnis retired as CEO in January 2011 and as chairman in 2015.
