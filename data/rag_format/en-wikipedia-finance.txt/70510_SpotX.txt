## History

SpotX was founded as a division of the search engine marketing technologies and services company, Booyah Networks. The company's founders are Michael Shehan (CEO) and Steve Swoboda (COO and CFO).

In March 2007, SpotX, initially SpotXchange, formed a separate company from Booyah that focused on digital video advertising technology. In 2009, SpotX launched targeting tools to help advertisers reach their audiences. In 2010, SpotX launched its real-time bidding solutionᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ, which helps companies tailor their bids on an impression-by-impression basis when bidding on in-stream and in-banner video ad inventory.

In July 2016, RTL Group announced its 65% majority stake purchase of SpotX at $144 million and completed its 100% acquisition of the company in October 2017 for $145 million in a deal that valued SpotX at $404 million.

In 2015, SpotXchange rebranded as SpotX. In 2017, SpotX relaunched its website.

In 2020, SpotX made a strategic investment in SpringServe, a supply-side ad server for CTV.

In 2021, SpotX was acquired by Magnite, Inc., the world's largest independent sell-side advertising platform, for $1.17 billion.
