RotoHog


# RotoHog



**RotoHog** was the consumer facing fantasy sports website for Fastpoint Games, a digital platform developer that designed, implemented and marketed fantasy services for media and advertising partners. The company developed and managed fantasy sports games for media companies, sports brands, and professional sports leagues, which were often co-branded.

Their signature game was a fantasy draft game with a stock market-style trading floor for baseball, basketball, American football, and Association Football (soccer). The company also offered traditional commissioner and pick-em style fantasy sports games.

RotoHog also branched out to entertainment games with the Rose Ceremony game for the reality TV show *The Bachelor* and the *Us Weekly* Celebrity Fantasy League.


## Fantasy Game Platform

RotoHog was also the provider of nba.com's NBA Stock Exchange and commissioner games and Brazilian media company Grupo RBS's first ever Fantasy Soccer game.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In 2009, RotoHog began to provide games for Fox Sports en Español and the AVP Pro Beach Volleyball tour.

In June 2009, RotoHog closed a multi-year deal with Sporting News to power the sports media company's suite of fantasy sports games.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ In March 2010, RotoHog began powering the MySpace Bracket Challenge for the NCAA college basketball tournament. At the same time, the company announced that it would be launching its first commissioner-style baseball game on its own site.

Like most fantasy sports games, the core elements of RotoHog's flagship stock exchange game involved building a team and setting a line-up to earn points. To this traditional core game, RotoHog added a liquid market for players that all team managers use to trade players. Players could be traded at almost any time and player prices reflected up-to-the minute supply and demand.

RotoHog differed from fantasy sports stock simulations in that the goal of the game was to score the most fantasy points by fielding the best team of players. Stock simulation games focus on increasing the value of a player's portfolio by anticipating price movements of players.

RotoHog also provided a social networking platform that allowed users to compete in unlimited size leagues grouped by location, team allegiance, or company affiliations in addition to smaller private leagues. An example of a large group of connected individuals using the site was the non-profit group *Hire-a-Hero*, which used RotoHog as a way to help military veterans connect with each other and transition back to civilian life.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
