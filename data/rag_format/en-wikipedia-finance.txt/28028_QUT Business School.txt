## QUT Graduate School of Business

Courses offered through the QUT Graduate School of Business include a Bachelor of Business, Master of Business Administration, Executive MBA (EMBA), Graduate Diploma in Business, Graduate Certificate in Business, Graduate Certificate in Business Administration, the discipline-based Master of Business, Master of Business - Executive under the 'Executive Education - Customised' category, Professional doctorates, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Business, and a Public sector management and leadership course for the enhancement of management and/or leadership skills.

Its MBA program can be completed in one and a half years full-time or in three years part-time. Each unit of an MBA program is delivered in seven week modules with six weeks of teaching periods followed by a final assessment in the last week. Students get to study a broad range of core units and can concentrate on particular areas by way of choosing electives. The Graduate Certificate of Business Administration can be completed in two teaching periods full-time or four teaching periods part-time. Students who complete the GCBA can articulate into the MBA.

The Business School's professional doctorate programs consist of units from its MBA course followed by units in research methodology and several research projects. The professional doctorates differ from the traditional Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) by way of incorporating a practical approach, business focus and real-world learning into both research and coursework components.

Its Master of Business program offered in multiple disciplines is delivered on a semester basis in 13 weeks, divided into 3 study periods (13 teaching weeks per semester) and can be completed in 18 months. The Master of Business course is designed particularly for students who prefer to specialise in specific disciplinary areas such as Professional Accounting, Strategic Advertising, or Applied Finance. From 2009 onwards, a more flexible approach to learning took place by the combined offering of internal contact hours, online studies and internal intensive study for certain units.

Students may articulate from the Graduate Certificate in Business, which takes one semester full-time to complete, to the Master of Business program. Students may also articulate to the two-year Master of Business (Advanced) course, which takes one more semester full-time equivalent study to complete in addition to the Master of Business program.


## Articulation

Students who enter either the MBA or Master of Business programs may exit with a Graduate Certificate after approximately one semester full-time equivalent (FTE) study. Students may also articulate from the Graduate Certificate program to the Masters and then the advanced Masters or MBA (Major) with full advanced standing (credit).
