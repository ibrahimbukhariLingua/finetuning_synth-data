# The Danish-UK Chamber of Commerce



**The Danish-UK Chamber of Commerce (DUCC)** was set up to enhance the Anglo-Danish marketplace through networking. The Royal Danish Embassy in London was one of the co-founders. To this day, the aim of the DUCC remains to promote trade and investment between Denmark and the UK by providing companies from both countries with a business forum in the UK.
