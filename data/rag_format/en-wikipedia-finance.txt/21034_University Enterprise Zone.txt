University Enterprise Zone


# University Enterprise Zone



**University Enterprise Zones** are specific geographical areas in the United Kingdom where universities engage with Local Enterprise Partnerships to provide business incubator spaces and stimulate economic growth by the application of university backed innovation.


## Pilot program

The ten year pilot program for University Enterprise zones was announced by David Cameron in December 2013 "in response to findings in the Witty Review that universities could play a bigger role in enhancing economic growth".

Of the nine applicants, four were funded:

* Sensor\_City in Liverpool
* The Digital Health Enterprise Zone in the University of Bradford
* Future Space at the University of the West of England, Bristol
* Ingenuity Centre in University of Nottingham

An interim evaluation of the policy was made in 2017 at a cost of Â£45k. The final evaluation is due in 2023.
