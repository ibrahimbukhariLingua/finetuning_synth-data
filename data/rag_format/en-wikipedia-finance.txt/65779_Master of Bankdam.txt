# Master of Bankdam



***Master of Bankdam*** (called *The Master of Bankdam* in its own credits) is a 1947 British historical film directed by Walter Forde and based on the 1940 novel *The Crowthers of Bankdam* by Thomas Armstrong.

The story concerns two generations of brothers who struggle for control of the family business in 19th century Yorkshire.


## Plot

The film begins in the 1850s at the time of the Crimean War. Bankdam is a small Yorkshire mill run by the Crowther family. It prospers and grows under its patriarch owner, Simeon Crowther. After family upheavals the firm goes through several crises under the management of his sons Zebediah and Joshua, who tend to oppose one another. Joshua dies with many others in a mill collapse, partially blamed on his brother Zebediah. Joshua's role is taken over by his son Simeon (junior). Later, the old patriarch, Simeon (senior), dies.

Zebediah is diagnosed with a rare heart condition and retires to Vienna for specialist treatment, leaving his son, Lancelot Handel, with power of attorney in his absence. Things at the mill deteriorate due to the new American McKinley Tariff and mismanagement. Lancelot reacts by firing men indiscriminately. Anger grows in the community. In the final scene a fatally ill Zebediah returns and, with a mob outside the door, chastises Lancelot for squandering money and ruining the family firm. Zebediah talks down an angry mob outside. Simeon Junior then promises to reopen the mills. Zebediah hears Simeon's speech to the crowd and decides Simeon must be the new Master of Bankdam and entrusts Bankdam.
