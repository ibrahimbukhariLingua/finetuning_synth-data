**Alation** is an enterprise software company based in Silicon Valley.

Alation Data Catalog is a data catalog that serves enterprises in organizing and consolidating their data. Alation launched its data catalog as their first product in 2015 to give data consumers an easy way to search for enterprise data with natural language.


## History

Alation was founded in 2012 by Satyen Sangani, Aaron Kalb, Feng Nui, and Venky Ganti. Alation grew out of different ideas aimed at solving the same question: How do you connect workers with questions to colleagues with answers?

Alation co-founders Satyen Sangani and Aaron Kalb arrived at the solution from two different perspectives. Sangani had a background in economics and had worked as an executive at Oracle. He knew data users in large companies struggled to find and trust data; he theorized that machine learning could be used to help them. Kalb had experience in symbolic systems and had worked on Siri at Apple. He thought crowdsourcing could be used to solve the challenge. In 2012, the team combined those two ideas to create Alation.

Its first solution, a data querying system powered by natural language processing, helped define the modern data catalog. The tool was designed to catalog data in an organization and make that data more accessible to more people. This concept is generally termed data democratization.

As the company improved the solution, it eased the building of complex queries with collaboration features, enabled data catalog efforts, and integrated with different data and related technology products, such as Snowflake, Tableau, Databricks, and others.

As of early 2021, the company had more than 250 customers, including AbbVie, American Family Insurance, Autozone, Cisco, Exelon, Finnair, Munich Re, New Balance, Pfizer, Scandinavian Airlines, and U.S. Foods. By October 2021, the company had increased that number to around 300 customers, adding GE Aviation, NASDAQ, and Regeneron, among others.

In October 2021, Alation acquired Lyngo Analytics, a data insights company which develops software to help users find insights by asking questions in simple business terms. The acquisition is intended to deepen Alation’s ability to convert natural language questions from non-technical users into SQL queries.

In January 2022, Alation launched the “Data Radicals” podcast hosted by the company’s CEO and co-founder, Satyen Sangani. The show is designed to help business, data, and technology enthusiasts use data in powerful ways. Guests have included Stan McChrystal, retired U.S. Army General and former commander of Joint Special Operations Command in Iraq; Wendy Turner-Williams, Chief Data Officer, Tableau; Amir Efrati, co-founder and executive editor, The Information; David Epstein, TED-talker and bestselling author of “RANGE” and “The Sports Gene;” Bob Seiner, president and principal, KIK Consulting; Jennifer Belissent, principal data strategist, Snowflake; Paola Saibene, former CTO for the State of Hawaii; Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, founder and CEO, storytelling with data; and Caroline Carruthers, CEO of Carruthers and Jackson and co-author of “The Chief Data Officer’s Playbook.”

In September 2022, Alation announced that it had achieved $100 million of annual recurring revenue (ARR).


## Funding
