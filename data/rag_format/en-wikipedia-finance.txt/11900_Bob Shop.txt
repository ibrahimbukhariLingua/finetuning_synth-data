Bob Shop


# Bob Shop



**Bob Shop**, formerly **Bidorbuy** or bidorbuy.co.za (officially written as one word, all-lowercase; variations: bid or buy, Bidorbuy and Bid or Buy), is a South African e-commerce website based on an internet auction and online marketplace. Transactions on Bidorbuy are in South African Rand.


## History

Bidorbuy (Bob Shop) was launched by Andy Higgins in August 1999 at the height of the dotcom boom, in South Africa. Initial funding and support was provided by Professor Yair Tauman, Professor Abraham Neyman, Mr. Danny Barnea, and Mr. Zohar Gilon. In 2000, the platform expanded to India and Australia. In 2001, after the dotcom crash, the Australian site was closed and the Indian website was merged with Baazee.com (which was sold to eBay in 2004).

Bidorbuy.co.za became the largest online marketplace in South Africa and Africa. In 2010, it invested into PayFast, a local online payment company, and 2014 into the e-commerce company uAfrica.com. It merged with UAfrica, in August 2022 to form Bob Group. In March 2023, UAfrica was rebranded as Bob Go and Bidorbuy as Bob Shop.


## Basic concept

Bob Shop's business model is described to be similar to eBay. Listings on the platform are either live auction or listed at a fixed price.


## Items traded on the site

Collectible items were the popular listings on Bidorbuy before it became Bob Shop, notably South African coins, stamps, antiques were listed on the platform. In 2008, Bidorbuy introduced auto listings, which attracted car dealerships to list on the site, making it one of the biggest online car shop windows in South Africa at the time. In the same year of 2008 Bid or Buy introduced property listing. Both were removed around 2022 and 2023.


## Trading formats

* **Auctions.** In the beginning, Bidorbuy featured only online auctions.
* **Buy Now.** In 2001, Bidorbuy introduced the buy now format for selling items at fixed prices.
