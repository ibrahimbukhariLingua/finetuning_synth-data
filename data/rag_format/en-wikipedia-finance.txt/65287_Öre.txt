Öre


# Öre



**Öre** (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈœ̂ːrɛ]) is the centesimal subdivision of the Swedish krona. In the Swedish language, the plural of *öre* is either *öre* (indefinite) or *ören* (definitive).

The name *öre* derives from the Latin word *aereus/aurum*, meaning gold. The corresponding subdivisions of the Norwegian and Danish krones are called øre.

Öre coins have been withdrawn since 2010, but the unit remains.


## History

During the Middle Ages, the öre was a unit of Swedish currency equal to 1/8 of a *mark*, 3 *örtugar* or either 24, 36 or 48 *penningar* (depending on the geographical area in which it was used). It was already a unit of account in the 11th century, but was not minted as a coin until 1522. This öre was withdrawn in 1776, but returned in 1855 as 1⁄100 of the riksdaler. The riksdaler was replaced by the *krona* in 1873 (one riksdaler equalling one krona), but *öre* remained the name of the minor unit.

The last öre coin was withdrawn in 2010, but the centesimal subdivision is still used in non-cash contexts such as bank balances and cashless transactions, while bills to be paid in cash are rounded to the nearest krona.
