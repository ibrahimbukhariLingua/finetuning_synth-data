## Ak Bars Holding

The bank is known to have founded Ak Bars Holding back in 1998 as its investment banking subdivision, spinning it off as a separate entity at the end of 2004, whilst keeping 7.65% of its equity under own control. In June 2022, it has officially ensured that it is not a subsidiary, dependent or affiliated company of Ak Bars Holding once the latter has been included into the 2022 sanctioned entities list, presumably for ownership of Zelenodolsk Shipyard.
