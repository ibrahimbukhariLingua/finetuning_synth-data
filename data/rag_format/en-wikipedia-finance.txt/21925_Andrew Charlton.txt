# Andrew Charlton



**Andrew Henry George Charlton** (born 26 September 1978) is an Australian politician and economist. He has been a Labor member of the Australian Parliament representing the federal division of Parramatta since the 2022 Australian Federal Election.

Charlton has been described as a "centrist, evidence-based, data-driven economist with entrepreneurial flair". He is the author of several books on economics including *Fair Trade for All* which he co-authored with Joseph Stiglitz, and most recently *Australia's Pivot to India*.


## Early life and education

Andrew Charlton was born in Sydney, New South Wales in 1978. He attended the Knox Grammar School in Wahroonga.

Charlton then attended the University of Sydney to study economics, where he was a resident of St Paul's College. He was awarded the university medal for economics. He later won a Rhodes Scholarship to attend the University of Oxford, where he earned a DPhil in economics.


## Career in economics


### Economic adviser

From December 2007 to June 2010, Charlton served as the chief economic adviser to then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Charlton played a role alongside Rudd in overseeing Australia's response to the 2007â€“2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, in which he established a reputation as one of the most innovative and gifted economists in Australia.

Notably, Charlton was Australia's senior official sent to the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009 at the request of then-Prime Minister Rudd.

In 2009 Charlton made news after he was threatened by then-Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull at the Midwinter Ball over the now disproven Utegate scandal. Ultimately it was Turnbull not Charlton who would lose their job over the matter.

Following Rudd's resignation in June 2010, Charlton ceased to be an adviser to the Prime Minister.


### Private business

In 2015, Charlton founded AlphaBeta Advisors, a consulting and technology firm and served as its director until it was acquired by Accenture in February 2020. Charlton was subsequently named Accenture's Sustainability Services Lead for Growth Markets.


## Political career


### 2022 federal election


#### Nomination as Labor candidate

In October 2021 then-Member for Parramatta Julie Owens announced she would not contest the next election, creating an open preselection for the seat. Owen's declared her wish for a rank-and-file preselection to determine the candidate for the marginal seat. Several locals declared their intention to nominate, however the Labor Party instead continued 'shopping around' for a candidate. Charlton's eventual announcement as the candidate created a furore in local branches (although this is contested) and the media. Many questioned Charlton's capacity to represent the electorate. However, others declared Charlton was exactly the calibre of person needed in Parliament. Labor leader Anthony Albanese supported Charlton's candidacy. He became the candidate on 1 April 2022 with only 50 days until the election.


#### Election result

With only 50 days as Labor's candidate until the election, Charlton secured more than 34,000 first preference votes at the 2022 Federal election. After preference flows, he secured 54.57% of the two-party-preferred vote, representing a 1.07% positive swing. He claimed victory on the night of the election following concession by his opponent, Maria Kovacic.


## Personal life

He is married to barrister Phoebe Arcus, with whom he has three children.

Charlton moved from a $16 million home in Bellevue Hill and purchased a house in North Parramatta in May 2022 to be more connected with the electors in the division of Parramatta. He later purchased a sub-penthouse in Parramatta when he was unable to renovate the previously purchased property.

Charlton purchased a $12 million home in Palm beach in 2024. Charlton's children continue to attend schools in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney.
