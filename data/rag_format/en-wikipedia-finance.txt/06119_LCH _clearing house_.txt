LCH (clearing house)


# LCH (clearing house)



**LCH** (originally **London Clearing House**) is a financial market infrastructure company headquartered in London that provides clearing services to major international exchanges and to a range of OTC markets. The LCH Group includes two main entities: **LCH Limited** based in London and **LCH SA** based in Paris (formally ***Banque Centrale de Compensation SA***, also known from 1999 to 2003 as **Clearnet** then until 2016 as **LCH.Clearnet**).

As of 2012ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, LCH cleared approximately 50% of the global interest rate swap market, and was the second largest clearer of bonds and repos in the world, providing services across 13 government debt markets. In addition, LCH clears a broad range of asset classes including: commodities, securities, exchange traded derivatives, credit default swaps, energy contracts, freight derivatives, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange and Euro and Sterling denominated bonds and repos.

LCH's members comprise many of the major global financial institutions including almost all of the major investment banks, broker dealers and international commodity houses. LCH, being a clearing house, sits in the middle of a trade – assuming the counterparty risk involved when two parties trade and guaranteeing the settlement of the trade. To mitigate the risks involved it imposes certain minimum requirements on its members and collects initial and variation margin (or collateral) from them for trades that have been executed.


## History

LCH traces its roots back to the *London Produce Clearing House*, established in 1888, and the Paris-based *Clearnet*, established in 1969. Both developed from clearing commodity transactions. They merged in 2003 to form LCH.Clearnet. In 2013, the London Stock Exchange Group acquired a majority stake in the business. In 2016 LCH.Clearnet dropped Clearnet from its branding name.
