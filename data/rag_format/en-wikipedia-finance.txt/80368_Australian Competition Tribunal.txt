The **Australian Competition Tribunal** is an independent statutory review body, legislated by part III of the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010.* The Tribunal was originally established under the *Trade Practices Act 1965* (Cth). Its members consist of judges drawn from the Federal Court of Australia. The Tribunal reviews merger authorisation determinations made by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).
