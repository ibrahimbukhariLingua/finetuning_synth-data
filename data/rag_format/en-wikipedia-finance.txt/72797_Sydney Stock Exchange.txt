# Sydney Stock Exchange



The **Sydney Stock Exchange** (**SSX**) is a stock exchange with its headquarters in Sydney, Australia. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the AIMS Financial Group, with a market license granted by the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) on 5 November 2013. Formerly known as the Asia Pacific Exchange (APX), APX listed its first few companies on 6 March 2014.


## History

The exchange first opened in 1997 as the Australian property exempt market before receiving a stock exchange license in August 2004. In November 2015, the exchange was renamed the **Sydney Stock Exchange**. To promote Sydney and Australia as a leading financial centre, and allow the listees to be identified as being listed on a major city's exchange, the exchange became known as the Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX). The exchange is an observer member of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges.
