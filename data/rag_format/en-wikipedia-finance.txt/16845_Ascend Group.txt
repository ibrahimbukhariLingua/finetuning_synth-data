# Ascend Group



**Ascend Group** is a privately owned e-commerce company headquartered in Bangkok, Thailand as a spin-off of True Corporation. It marked its $150-million expansion by launching their affiliates in the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, plus hard to reach economies like Myanmar and Cambodia.


## History

Launched in 2014, Ascend Group consolidates True Corporation's previous e-commerce and service ventures, in order to facilitate seamless inter-unit service. Ventures are classified under major subsidiaries: Ascend Commerce, Ascend Money and Ascend Capital, along with smaller independent ventures like TrueIDC and Egg Digital..

In April 2018, Ascend was at the centre of controversy as over 11,000 customers had their data leaked due to the company not protecting their users accounts correctly. The leaks included the ID card information of their customers.
