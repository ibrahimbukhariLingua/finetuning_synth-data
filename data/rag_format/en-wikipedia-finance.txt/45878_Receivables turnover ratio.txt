Receivables turnover ratio


# Receivables turnover ratio



**Receivable turnover ratio** or **debtor's turnover ratio** is an accounting measure used to measure how effective a company is in extending credit as well as collecting debts. The receivables turnover ratio is an activity ratio, measuring how efficiently a firm uses its assets.

Formula:

A high ratio implies either that a company operates on a cash basis or that its extension of credit and collection of accounts receivable is efficient. While a low ratio implies the company is not making the timely collection of credit.

A good accounts receivable turnover depends on how quickly a business recovers its dues or, in simple terms how high or low the turnover ratio is. For instance, with a 30-day payment policy, if the customers take 46 days to pay back, the Accounts Receivable Turnover is low.


## Relation ratios

* Days' sales in receivables = 365 / Receivable turnover ratio
* Average collection period = ⁠Days × AR/Credit sales⁠
* Average debtor collection period = ⁠Trade receivables/Credit sales⁠ × 365 = Average collection period in days,
* Average creditor payment period = ⁠Trade payables/Credit purchases⁠ × 365 = Average Payment period in days,
