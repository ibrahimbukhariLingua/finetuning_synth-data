The Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) was established after a series of corporate scandals, including the collapse of Enron and WorldCom in the United States and of Parmalat in Europe, led to demand for an independent body to oversee auditors and to ensure that audit standards are in the public interest.
The board was formally established on 28 February 2005, and Thomadakis was appointed its first chairman.
Speaking at the launch of the PIOB, Thomadakis said: "The creation of the PIOB is a landmark in the cooperation of world regulatory organizations for the oversight of international standard-setting for auditors. The project of the PIOB is ambitious and represents a novelty for world-level public oversight. Success for the PIOB will mean quality, stability, and integrity in companies and world markets".
