Netherlands Competition Authority


# Netherlands Competition Authority



The **Netherlands Competition Authority** (Dutch: **Nederlandse Mededingingsautoriteit**, **NMa**) was the competition regulator for the Netherlands. After a merger with the Consumentenautoriteit and Onafhankelijke Post en Telecommunicatie Autoriteit on 1 April 2013, it became the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (Dutch: Autoriteit Consument en Markt). The Netherlands Competition Authority monitored all Dutch markets, to ensure fair competition.

The "Dutch office of Energy Regulation" (*Energiekamer*) was part of the Netherlands Competition Authority and committed to making energy markets work as effectively as possible.


## Tasks

The main goal for the Netherlands Competition Authority was to ensure fair competition between Dutch companies. In order to do so, it focused on 3 main tasks:

* To fight cartel-deals
* To prevent the abuse of economic strength, for example in virtual monopoly or oligopoly situations
* To check on the concentrations and spread of companies
