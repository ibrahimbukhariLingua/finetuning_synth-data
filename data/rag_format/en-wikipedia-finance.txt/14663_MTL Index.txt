**MTL Index** was a French company dedicated to the sale of strategic metals and rare earths.
The company developed in Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Dubai but seems to be defunct. The last newsletter on the company's website dates from January 2016. The index is composed of companies that are involved in the exploration, development, and production of metals and minerals, including gold, silver, copper, iron ore, and other resources. The index is calculated by the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and is intended to serve as a benchmark for the performance of the metals and mining sector in Canada. The MTL Index has been in existence since the late 1990s and includes some of the largest and most well-known mining companies in Canada, such as Teck Resources, Barrick Gold, and Kinross Gold.

## Investor Warning

In April 2016, the French financial authority AMF issues a warning
to potential investors about MTL Index. The French courts opened an investigation for fraud, but following an international rogatory commission enabling them to check the metals stored in Germany, it turned out that all the orders had been delivered to the customers. The charges were dropped against MTL Index, but as it was unable to continue its business during the investigation, it had to close down, leaving more than 1,000 customers to fend for themselves. These customers are still in possession of their metals.
