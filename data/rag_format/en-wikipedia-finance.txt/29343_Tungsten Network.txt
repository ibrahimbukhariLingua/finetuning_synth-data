## History

Tungsten Network "was founded [in 2013] by Edmund Truell and Danny Truell to identify and acquire a company, business or asset within the financial services sector which it can grow into a business with a significant market presence in a segment with potential for sustainable long-term cash generation, return on equity and growth." A major acquisition was OB10, a global electronic transaction service with headquarters in London, England. Founded in 2000 by Stefan Foryszewski, Chris Lowrie, Alain Falys and John Jermy, Tungsten Network underwent a series of corporate expansions and acquisitions. The company, led by its founder and CEO Edmund "Eddie" Truell, agreed to the 2013 buyout of Open Business Exchange for £99 million (GBP) in cash and shares. The purchase of DocuSphere in September 2014 significantly extended their e-invoice automation technology.

Founded from Open Business Exchange, or OB10, Tungsten Network's electronic invoicing and payment services are partnered with companies including Alliance Data, IBM, Kellogg's, General Motors, and the US Federal Government. Nearly 80% of the suppliers Tungsten serves are small to medium-sized global business.


### OB10 collaboration and acquisition - 2000

When OB10 was founded, e-invoicing services were not permitted in a majority of the European Union.ᵖᵃᵍᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ However, OB10's services were launched in late 2000, followed by the establishment of offices in New York. As e-invoicing services grew, OB10 established offices in San Francisco and Atlanta in the United States, as well as Sofia, Bulgaria and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Tungsten officially purchased OB10 in October 2013.


### Transition to Tungsten Network - 2013

Tungsten Corporation finalized the acquisition of OB10 in October 2013, rebranding the e-invoicing platform “Tungsten Network”. Tungsten purchased OB10 for £99 million, as well as having signed a five-year agreement to license @UK's Spend Analysis software. Tungsten Network provides a global cloud-based trading network built on OB10's e-invoicing platform. The service integrates client billing and accounting systems with their suppliers' invoicing and accounting systems.


### Purchasing DocuSphere - 2014

In September 2014, Tungsten acquired DocuSphere – a US-based provider of invoice-automation services. The purchase was funded by a share placing, rather than an open offer.
