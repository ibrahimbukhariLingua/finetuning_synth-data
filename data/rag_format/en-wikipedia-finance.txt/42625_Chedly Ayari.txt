He was then a member of the political office and central committee of the Socialist Destourian Party until 1975. President Habib Bourguiba appointed him to numerous ministerial positions within his cabinet.

Ayari was appointed president of the Central Bank of Tunisia on 24 July 2012, replacing Mustapha Kamel Nabli and being approved by the Constituent Assembly of Tunisia by a vote of 97 to 89, with 4 abstentions. His approval was highly criticized due to his relationship with former ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who was overthrown during the Tunisian Revolution in 2011.

Thanks to his efforts, he won the Tatweej Award for Excellence and Quality in the Arab world in 2014.
