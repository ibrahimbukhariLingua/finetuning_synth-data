## History


### Early Years 1871 Onwards

The beginnings of the Hayleys Group can be traced back to 1871 when Charles Pickering Hayley (1848–1934), the son of British businessman, Thomas Hayley (1807–1881), disembarked from the *Percy Douglas*, a 781-tonne clipper ship (owned by Thomas Hayley), at Galle, Ceylon. The ship subsequently was wrecked off the coast of Rangoon.

Hayley joined a firm of shipping agents, Thomson Mitchell & Co, in 1874. When the company closed three years later due to bad investments, he rented a shop on Pedlar Street in Galle Fort and started his own import/export company, Chas. P. Hayley & Co., on 10 January 1878, exporting local products including coir, cinnamon and citronella oil and importing goods such as British claret. Hayley married Gertrude Fanny Lee (1849–1911), the daughter of George Lee, the Postmaster General of Ceylon (1844–1860) and Martha née Austin. The couple had six children and in 1893 his oldest son, Alec (1875–1936), joined the firm, followed by another son, Stuart Pickering (1883–1960), eight years later.

In 1909, he entered into a partnership with W. W. Kenny to purchase Thurburn Stores, at Deans Road.

Hayley and Kenny became a Private Limited Company in 1935 and Chas P. Hayley & Co. becomes a private limited liability company and fully owned subsidiary of Hayley and Kenny Ltd. in 1944. In 1954 under one corporate umbrella, the entity went public. Hayleys Ltd continued to diversify into a portfolio that currently includes activated carbon, rubber gloves, textiles, fibre-based products, tea and rubber plantations, leisure, transportation and logistics services, consumer products, and other investments and services to name just a few.

In 1958, its shipping agency department was restructured as Maritime Agencies Ltd, which later evolved into Hayleys Advantis. In the 1960s, Hayleys partnered with Bayer of Germany to establish Haychem Ltd for agrochemical production. A period of innovation followed with the establishment of Haycarb Ltd to produce activated carbon from coconut shell charcoal, a pioneering value-added export. The company further expanded by acquiring Ravi Industries Ltd, a coir brush manufacturer, and founding Dipped Products Ltd for rubber glove production. By 1983, Hayleys launched its first international venture in the United States, now known as Haycarb USA Inc. Throughout the subsequent decade, the company diversified further into hospitality, plantations, and textiles.
