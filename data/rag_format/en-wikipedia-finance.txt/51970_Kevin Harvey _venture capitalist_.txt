Rhys Vineyards has produced award-winning wines. Antonio Galloni, a wine critic, has called it, "one of the finest wineries in the United States."

Rhys Vineyards has developed eight estate vineyards. Six of these, including Alpine, Family Farm, Home, Horseshoe, Mount Pajaro and Skyline, are located in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA. Two more vineyards, Bearwallow and Clarke Ranch, are located in Mendocino County.

Rhys Vineyards has also developed a ninth estate vineyard, Centennial Mountain, devoted to Italian grape varieties. These wines are sold under the Aeris label. As part of this project, the Aeris team brought in two Sicilian grape varieties, Carricante and Nerello Mascalese, that are not known to have been grown in California prior. *The San Francisco Chronicle* has described Carricante as "The best white wine you have never tasted". Aeris also owns two vineyards in Sicily and these wines are also sold under the Aeris label.
