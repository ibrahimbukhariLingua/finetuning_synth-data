Perth leadership outcome model


# Perth leadership outcome model



The **Perth leadership outcome model** is a leadership model that characterizes leaders by the financial outcome of their leadership. It was developed by E. Ted Prince over a four-year period.


## Traditional approaches

The traditional leadership models are based on either a personality or a behavioral/competency approach. The personality approach is rooted in the "Great Man" theories popular in the early 20th century. Research in this tradition sought to identify the personal qualities that distinguished leaders from followers or effective leaders from ineffective leaders.

The behavioral/competency approaches focus on individual managerial competencies.

## Historical development

The PLOM is related to two intellectual precursors. The work by the German sociologist Max Weber, linked social and economic variables.

The other precursor is psychologist David McClelland.
