The start-up received a lot of attention in the German press for its Social entrepreneurship model and an innovation in the packaging sector, the first mineral water bottle made from 100 percent recycled used plastic on the German market.

A few months after its launch, share was certified as a B Corporation and was awarded the "Best for the World" B Corp in the "Community" category in 2019. This makes share one of the 10% of companies worldwide that provide the greatest benefit to the community.

However, Kathrin Krause from the Federation of German Consumer Organizations criticized the fact that share does nothing to address the causes of hunger or the price pressure that retailers exert on their producers. But overall the reception is predominantly positive. Melchior Poppe from German magazine Focus Online particularly emphasizes the holistic approach of share – in both an ecological and social context: "Sustainability across the board – affordable and with positive effects for everyone."

Burkhard Wilke, Managing Director of the German Central Institute for Social Issues, criticized a "certain lack of transparency" at share, as the exact amount of the respective donation is not indicated on the product. Since autumn 2018, share has shown the donation amount for the respective product online. A QR code on the product packaging gives consumers direct access to the project information.
