## History

The company was founded in 2003 in Virginia by David L. Hancock. In their early years, Morgan James provided a hybrid of traditional publishing and a subsidy publisher model in which entrepreneurial business nonfiction authors pre-paid fees against the publisher's royalties to be published. Hancock became business partners with *Guerrilla Marketing* author Jay Conrad Levinson and together they published a series of non-fiction books.

In December 2008, the company was invited by NASDAQ to ring the opening bell and to recognize the book *Do Your Giving While You Are Living* by Eva Haller, which the company promotes.

In September 2013, the company launched an E-book bundling program.

In February 2015, the company signed a partnering agreement with Aerbook, and the Aer.io Retail Network to offer excerpts and sales of its titles using social media.

In August 2018, Morgan James Publishing announced a partnership with Publica. *Publishers Weekly* listed the firm as one of the fastest-growing independent publishers of 2014, 2015 and 2018.
