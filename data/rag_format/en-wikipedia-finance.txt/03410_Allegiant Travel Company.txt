The **Allegiant Travel Company** is an American airline holding and hospitality company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company owns the airline Allegiant Air and Sunseeker Resorts.


## History

The Allegiant Travel Company was founded in 1999 as the parent company of Allegiant Air, which itself had been founded in 1997. Initially based out of Fresno, California, the company reorganized in 2000 with Maurice J. Gallagher Jr. gaining an almost 20 percent stake in the company. He had previously been a prominent creditor of Allegiant and was one of the co-founders of ValuJet Airlines.

In May 2006, Allegiant Travel Company filed plans for an initial public offering (IPO). It officially began trading on the Nasdaq exchange under the stock ticker symbol, ALGT, in December of that year.

By 2024, Allegiant Travel's primary subsidiary, Allegiant Air, had switched from a fleet predominately composed of MD-80s to one exclusively composed of Airbus and Boeing jets.
