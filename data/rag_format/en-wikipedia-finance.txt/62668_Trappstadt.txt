## *Ganerbschaft*

Trappstadt was a *Ganerbschaft* which was joint family estate, over which the co-heirs (*Ganerben*) only had rights in common. In the 13th century Trappstadt was divided by the counts of Henneberg and the monasteries of Theres and Veilsdorf. Three hundred years later in 1524, there were already twelve *Ganerben* issued.

The possession of the *Ganerben* quarters were divided as follows:

* The residents of Würzburg (former Theres Abbey) had 22 houses.
* Monastery Veilsdorf (from 1699 cathedral chapter of Würzburg) had 28 houses.
* Henneberg family (from 1584 Saxony) had 22 houses.
* Nine houses since 1524 were owned: Schott (until 1585), Echter (until 1665), Faust von Stromberg (until 1738), Grafen von Eltz until 1824).
