## Political career


### Senate


### First term (2003-2007)

Ugbane was elected to the Senate to represent Kogi East Senatorial District in 2003 representing the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP). In 2004, he opposed a proposal by the Central Bank of Nigeria to overhaul the categorization of banks into mega, medium and small categories.
Following a plane crash in Abuja in October 2006 that killed over 95 people, Ugbane was among Senators that called for the resignation of Aviation minister, Prof. Babalola Borishade.


### Second term (2007-2011)

Ugbane was reelected in 2007 running on the PDP platform. He was appointed to committees on Public Accounts, Niger Delta, Independent National Electoral Commission and Aviation.
During a debate over nomination of Senator David Mark as Senate President, Ugbane was considered as an alternative.
In May 2007, the Senate resolved to probe the use of funds earmarked for the Independent National Electoral Commission. Ugbane, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, supported the probe but defended himself against allegations that he had not exercised sufficient oversight.

In 2008, Ugbane was vocal in the campaign against corruption and fraud in the power sector during the period when President Olusegun Obasanjo was in power (1999–2007).

In December 2008, Ugbane of Kogi East, which is also the base of Kogi State governor Ibrahim Idris, became involved in a dispute with Senator Smart Adeyemi of Kogi West over nomination of ministers from the state.
