# GroceryAid



**GroceryAid** is a registered (1095897) benevolent society for people from all over the United Kingdom who have worked, or are working in the grocery industry, and who find they need extra support to get by. Founded in 1857 the National Grocers Benevolent Fund has been trading under the GroceryAid name since October 2012. The charity over the years has combined with numerous charities, including the London Grocers & Tea Dealers Federation, the Grocers Federation Benevolent Fund and the Grocers Employees National Benevolent Fund. More recently the charity merged with The Confectioners Benevolent Fund in 2012. At this time, the charity ceased to trade under the Caravan name and in the autumn of 2012 became known as GroceryAid. There are seven regional Branches which help to raise funds for the charity across the UK. There are also two Network Awareness Groups in which industry colleagues focus on raising awareness of the charity.
