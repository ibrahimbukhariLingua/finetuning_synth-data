Scottish Business Network


# Scottish Business Network



**Scottish Business Network** (**SBN**) is a non-profit organisation based in Edinburgh.

SBN is led by Chair Russell Dalgleish and aims to connect the Scottish diaspora and support international business connectivity from Scotland. It organises Scottish International Week, a series of international events that promote trade, exports, and internationalisation opportunities for Scottish companies by facilitating connections with the diaspora.


## History

The history of Scottish Business Network (SBN) dates back to 2008 when Russell Dalgleish was inspired by an art event in Trafalgar Square organised by Antony Gormley. Dressed in a kilt and playing Scottish music, Dalgleish reflected on his Scottish identity and his lack of connection to Scotland while in London. Motivated by this experience, in 2016, Russell Dalgleish and former Scottish Enterprise executive Christine Esson founded SBN to connect Scots in the UK capital.

SBN's initial focus was to host monthly events in London, featuring Scottish firms such as Appointed, to engage with senior Scots, stimulating commercial activities.

Later, SBN set up "soft landing" support centres in London and Dubai, providing facilities and local network access to help Scottish companies expand. Additional events were held in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai. The organisation also introduced a digital platform developed by Glasgow's VeryConnect and a consultancy service aimed at helping Scottish businesses enter new markets.

In 2017, SBN received a small grant from the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise to support sustainable economic growth in Scotland.

In February 2021, SBN established an office in the United States to enhance support for Scottish companies in North America and to facilitate trade between the regions. Previously, in 2020, the organisation appointed Ian Houston as the ambassador in Washington, D.C., Tom Thomas in India, and Fraser Grier in New York City.

Since its founding in 2016, the network has evolved to include 48 voluntary ambassadors across 22 countries, focusing on facilitating global business connections for the Scottish diaspora.
