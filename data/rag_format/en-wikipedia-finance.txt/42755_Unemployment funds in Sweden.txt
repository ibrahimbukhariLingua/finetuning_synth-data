Unemployment funds in Sweden


# Unemployment funds in Sweden



In Sweden, an **unemployment fund** (Swedish: *arbetslöshetskassa*) is an economic association tied to a trade union, except the *Unemployment fund Alfa* and a few unemployment funds for self-employed and employers.

Since July 1, 2002, an unemployment fund is to some extent equal to a government agency, and is as thus comprised by the Freedom of the Press Act of the Swedish constitution. The primary function of the unemployment funds is to administrate and pay unemployment benefits, according to law (*Lag om arbetslöshetsförsäkring* (1997:238) and *Lag om arbetslöshetskassor* (1997:239)).

The Swedish unemployment insurance is in general divided into two parts – the basic insurance (Alfa-kassan) and a voluntary funds (which are mostly more profitable for the unemployed).


## Alfa-kassan

**Alfa-kassan** fund is independent and under certain conditions its financial help is available to all Swedish citizens (or residents) over the age of 20, regardless of work field. This insurance is mandatory and consists of flat rate benefit of 365 SEK (~34 EUR) per day. The requirements to obtain this benefit are as follows:

• to be enrolled at the Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen)

• to be (partly) unemployed

• actively seek for work and be prepared to accept a suitable job

• be able to work at least 3 hours a day, 17 hours per week

• to have worked at least 80 hours per month for 6 months (which don’t have to be consecutive)

• to have worked 480 hours during 6 consecutive calendar months for a minimum of 50 hours every month


## Voluntary funds

**Voluntary income-related insurance** works on a principle of a membership. Since you are a member of this type of fund for at least 12 months and you have worked 6 months of half-time work, you are allowed to get the payment equal to 80% of your regular salary (for the first 200 days of unemployment). Although the maximum is 910 SEK (~84 EUR) per day. For the following 100 days you receive 70% of your average income, but maximum is 760 SEK (~70 EUR) per day. There is also an advantage for unemployed parents of small children (under the age of 18), they can get the 70% of their normal income for additional 150 days.

The membership is a little bit limited as well. You have to be less than 64 years old. You cannot be a member of 2 or more funds at the same time. And you have to pay a membership fees.
