# EVN Macedonia



**EVN Macedonia** (Macedonian: ЕВН Македонија; Albanian: *EVN Maqedoni*) is a power distribution and supply company in North Macedonia.

## History

In 2005, the former state monopoly ESM (*ЕСМ – Електростопанство на Македонија [*Elektrostopanstvo na Makedonija*]*, litt. *Electricity of Macedonia*) was split in three companies:

* A distribution and supply company, initially called ESM AD, sold in 2006 to Austrian EVN Group and renamed as EVN Macedonia (*EВН Македонија*).
* A state-owned power-producing company, initially called ELEM (*ЕЛЕМ – Електрани на Македонија [*Elektrani na Makedonija*]*, litt. *Power plants of Macedonia*), in charge of the country's power plants. The company was renamed in 2019 as ESM (Elektrani na Severna Makedonija, *ЕСМ - Електрани на Северна Македонија*, litt. *Power plants of North Macedonia*) after the country itself changed its name to North Macedonia, reverting to the initialism used between 1990 and 2006.
* A state-owned transmission system operator MEPSO
