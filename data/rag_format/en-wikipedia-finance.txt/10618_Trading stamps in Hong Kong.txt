# Trading stamps in Hong Kong



Stamp collection is a common practice among retail outlets in Hong Kong. The concept is to allow customers to redeem free gifts or shopping discounts after purchase. The general mechanism is that stamps will be given to customers when their single purchase exceeds a certain amount of money.

Usually, the number of stamps given to customers is directly proportional to the money they spend on that purchase. The more they spend, the more stamps they get. Then, customers can stick the stamps on the collection booklet provided by the shop. When they have collected enough stamps, they can redeem them for products or chances to take part in some activities like lucky draws. The products for redemption may only be available in that particular stamp collection activity. This kind of practice is commonly implemented in different companies in Hong Kong in order to attract customers.
