AUR was created in November 2004 from the merger of the FoodWorks Supermarket Group and Australian United Retailers (AUR). It is Australia's second largest leading independent supermarket retailing group, supporting in excess of A$1.35 billion in annual sales at the retail level. Its main competitors are Woolworths, Coles, IGA and Aldi.

The AUR currently has over 600 supermarkets, grocery stores and convenience stores. The stores span seven states and territories with over 400 of them operating under the FoodWorks brand.

FoodWorks has some similarities to IGA, the brand's closest competitor. They have similar ancestry, both being created from independent retail stores merging to create supermarket groups. Also, both comprise multiple individual retailers originally trading under some of the same independent chains.

In addition, IGA's main home brand is Black and Gold, a generic food brand which also sells in FoodWorks stores across the country. FoodWorks have a number of their own generic brands.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
