Star Air (South Africa)


# Star Air (South Africa)



**Star Air Cargo Pty Ltd**, usually known simply as **Star Air**, is a South African airline that leases out passenger and cargo aircraft.


## History

Star Air has been trading since 1996. It originally operated smaller aircraft, flying courier freight and small cargo for DHL Express (hence the *Cargo* name) and other companies contracted to fly for FedEx.

After starting to operate passenger flights, Star Air decided to move out of the smaller aircraft and to begin operating the Boeing 737, and started with their first 737-200 aircraft in 2007. Star Air has since negotiated leases with aircraft leasing companies for the newer generation 737-300 and 737-400 aircraft, to replace the 737-200s.

In June 2019, Star Air was acquired by Comair, who reportedly paid $5.14 million to acquire the airline and its repair division, Star Air Maintenance, and in December 2019 the acquisition was confirmed by the South African Competition Commission.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ However due to financial restraints imposed on Comair during CV19 flight groundings for 5 months in South Africa, in Oct 2020 the deal was cancelled.
