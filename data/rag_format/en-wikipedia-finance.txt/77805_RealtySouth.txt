In 2014, the company was ordered to pay a $500,000 fine for alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), with the specific claim that RealtySouth improperly urged, and in some cases, required, customers to use RealtySouth's own title insurer, TitleSouth. While not admitting any wrongdoing, RealtySouth agreed to a consent order requiring them to pay the $500,000 fine and to alter their customer paperwork to allow for a more clear choice of title insurers.
