The company was founded in 1971 and is one of the largest travel businesses in the country. It was a subsidiary of Lotte Corporation until 2005 when it was split off.

## History

Lotte Tour Development was founded on May 24, 1971.

In 2005, Lotte Tour divested from its parent company Lotte Corporation to become an individual entity. Despite the split, the smaller Lotte Tour kept its name and branding unchanged. In 2007, when Lotte Corporation partnered with JTB Corporation to form a new tourism division, it demanded that Lotte Tour change its branding, leading to a dispute. Lotte Tour was forced by injunction to change its logo but was allowed to retain its name.

In 2016, Lotte Tour announced that it had selected China State Construction Engineering Corporation to build its 38-story Jeju Dream Tower hotel and casino project on Jeju Island at a projected cost of ₩700 billion (US$605.1 million) with an opening date of March 2019. By the time the project was fully financed, the cost had risen to ₩1.6 trillion (US$1.4 billion). The building was opened to the public on December 18, 2020.
