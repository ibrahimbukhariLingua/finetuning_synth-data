## History

In 1990, the Hong Kong government reformed radio broadcasting regulations, allowing the introduction of a third radio station. It released the license to Metro Radio.

In 1991, Metro Radio set up its headquarters in Site 11 Whampoa Garden in Hunghom, Kowloon (香港九龍紅磡黃埔花園 第十一期). At that time, Metro Radio had two Chinese channels- channel FM99.7 (勁歌台) and channel FM104 (金曲台) and an English channel - AM 1044 (Metro News).

In 1994, Philip Chan Yan Kin (陈欣健) took over as General Manager and revised many of its programs. In 1996 Metro Radio carried out a strategic shift of focus from news services to entertainment. The names of channel FM99.7 (勁歌台) and channel FM104 (金曲台) were changed to Hit Radio (新城997) and FM Select (精選104) respectively, and Metro News became Metro Plus.
In the same year, Chan Hoi-kei (陳海琪) resigned as leader, and was replaced by Bak wan-kam (白韻琴).

In 1997 due to an expansion, the head office of Metro Radio moved to Basement 2 Site 6 Whampoa Garden, Hunghom, Kowloon (香港九龍紅磡黃埔花園第六期地庫二層).

In 1998 the company set up another broadcasting station in Central's The Center (中環中心), Hong Kong Island.

On 22 January 2001, it changed the name of Hit Radio (新城997) to Metro Showbiz (新城娛樂台). On 5 February, FM Select (精選104) was renamed Metro Finance (新城財經台).

In 2004,, Metro Radio expanded its broadcasting in the Pearl River Delta by entering into a shared programming agreement with Radio Guangdong (廣東電台).

On 2 January 2008, Metro Showbiz was renamed to Metroinfo (新城知訊台). Metroinfo broadcast both entertainment and financial programs.

The CEO of Metro Radio was Kam Kwok-leung (甘國亮) and the director of Metroinfo was Chu Ming-yui (朱明銳) in the past.
