| 1994 | December | Product | Intel suffers a public relations disaster when CNN publicized the story that there was a flaw in the way that the Pentium chip did division. Intel argued that the flaw was irrelevant, but then IBM halted shipments of Pentium-based computers, forcing Intel to reverse course and offer a no-questions-asked return policy. |
