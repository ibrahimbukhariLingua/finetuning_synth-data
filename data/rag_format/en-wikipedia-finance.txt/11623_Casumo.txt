## Regulatory sanctions

On 10 May 2018 the UK Gambling Commission imposed a financial penalty under section 121 of the Gambling Act at the sum of £5,850,000 on Casumo Services Limited. The fine was due to a breach of Anti-money laundering measures and failure to comply with the social responsibility code of practice. The licensee has accepted the decision.

On 2 April 2019 Casumo was yet again hit by another regulatory-imposed fine by the Dutch gambling regulator Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) for the amount of €310,000 for illegally targeting consumers in the Netherlands.

In March 2021 Casumo was hit yet again by a €7m fine from the Gambling Commission after failing to comply multiple times with key elements within social- and financial concepts revolving around the industry.

In March 2022, the Gambling Commission imposed a financial penalty after the company allowed a customer to lose £1.1m without any interaction. The penalty was imposed under the Social Responsibility code provision 3.4.1., which states that ““licensees must interact with customers in a way that minimises the risk of customers experiencing harms associated with gambling”. As a result of not meeting the requirements for this in addition to anti-money laundering failures, the Gambling commission imposed a £6/$8.2 million fine.
