# JAC Group



**JAC Group** (Chinese: 江汽集团; officially **Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp., Ltd.**) is a Chinese automobile and commercial vehicle manufacturer. The company is based in Hefei, Anhui Province, China.

The company produced about 524,000 units in 2021, including 271,800 commercial vehicles and 252,500 passenger vehicles. It also sold 16,800 BEVs in December 2021. It is considered a relatively small carmaker, ranking outside of the top 10 Chinese automakers in terms of cars sold.


## History

Established in 1964 as Hefei Jianghuai Automobile Factory, its name was changed to Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd. in 1997. The company made an IPO on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2001.

JAC has historically only produced commercial trucks under the brand name Jianghu(undei), but MPVs and SUVs appeared in the 2000s. By 2007, the company had gained government approval for passenger car production but, nonetheless, continued to be referred to as a truck maker. Prior to the 2007 acquisition of a passenger car license, JAC cooperated with Hyundai Motor Company in the early 2000s in an attempt to expand its product line.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Beginning in 2003, it assembled Hyundai MPVs although this stopped sometime prior to 2007. At least two models based on Hyundai technology continued to be made by JAC after the cooperation was cancelled–a MPV and a SUV. Hyundai explored setting up a joint venture with the company in 2004.

In 2009, the Chinese government indicated that it supported consolidation in the Chinese auto industry, leading analysts to predict the possibility of JAC joining with Chery since they are both located in Anhui province. On the surface such a merger would make sense: Chery mainly built passenger cars, and JAC was almost entirely focused on trucks at the time. Since then, however, JAC has made it clear that it is not interested in consolidation under the aegis of the larger Chery. JAC has begun to concentrate more on passenger cars, and a 2010 announcement of a new electric vehicle program may—at least partially—have been an effort to stave off the rumored merger.

Sales reached more than 445,000 units in 2012.

In 2013 it was one of the top ten most-productive vehicle manufacturers in China selling 458,500 units for 2.5% market share and reaching eighth place. JAC dropped one spot to ninth in 2011 making nearly 500,000 vehicles, and in 2012 a fall in units produced to about 445,000 precipitated the company's moving down one more rung to tenth place. Estimated production capacity is over 500,000 units/year as of 2009.

In 2014, JAC Motors announced its full acquisition of JAC Group, the new company would be trade as JAC Motors in the stock market but operated in the name of JAC Group.

In 2016 JAC entered into an agreement with DR Automobiles to export its vehicles to Italy. JAC models made in China will be re-approved according to European safety and anti-pollution regulations by DR and sold with the DR badge. The first cars imported into Italy are the JAC Refine S3 renamed DR4 (or EVO 4) and the JAC iEV40 sold as the DR Evo Electric (or EVO 3 Electric).


### Cooperation with Volkswagen

In 2017 JAC and Volkswagen Group announced a joint venture to produce electric cars for the Chinese market with the SEAT brand, in April 2018 the JAC-Volkswagen joint venture was officially born, which however operates through the new Sol brand, and no longer SEAT. The first product is the SOL E20X vehicle, an electric crossover resulting from a badge engineering of the JAC iEV40 (also called JAC Refine S2 EV) with a front redesigned by the SEAT style center in Spain.

In 2020, Volkswagen Group signs letters of intent between Volkswagen (China) Investment Co. Ltd. and the Government of Anhui Province, for the increase of the Volkswagen Group's stake in the JAC Volkswagen joint venture, from the current 50% to 75%. A transition that also requires investment in JAG (JAC Holding Group), the parent company of JAC and owned by the Anhui Government. The agreement between the parties, subject to the usual regulatory approvals, provides for the investment of an amount equal to one billion euros and should be concluded by the end of the year. Volkswagen would also acquire 50% of JAG (the parent company of JAC).

Volkswagen Group holds a 75% share of Volkswagen Anhui while JAC Group holds a 25% share. Volkswagen Group also owned 50% of JAC Holding Group (JAG), the parent company of JAC Group, which means Volkswagen Group also owns a 14.09% stake of JAC Group. As a result, the ownership percentage held by Volkswagen Group in Volkswagen Anhui actually reaches 78.52%.


### OEM for NIO

In April 2016, NIO and JAC Group signed a manufacturing cooperation agreement, preliminarily confirming a production and sales target of 50,000 vehicles per year for a duration of 5 years.

In 2018, NIO's first mass-produced model, the NIO ES8, manufactured by JAC, was officially launched.

In March 2021, NIO and JAC Group established Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing Technology (Anhui) Co., Ltd., with each party holding a 50% stake in the joint venture. In the same month, both company agree to extend the contract of manufacturing to May 2024. As part of the agreement renewal, NIO paid JAC CNY 1.2 billion for the extension of contract manufacturing services.

In December 2023, NIO has announced the acquisition of JAC factories manufacturing NIO vehicles at the price of CNY 3.158 billion, which marks the end of OEM for NIO.

Since the commencement of OEM partnership, NIO has paid JAC the amount of CNY 223 million, CNY 441 million, CNY 532 million, CNY 715 million, and CNY 1.127 billion in the years 2018 to 2022 respectively. Over the five-year period, the total amount paid for contract manufacturing services reached a substantial sum of CNY 3.038 billion.

On January 11, 2024, JAC has signed strategic cooperation framework agreements with Nio to establish cooperation in battery standards, battery swapping technology, the construction of battery swapping service networks, and operation.


### Partnership with Huawei

In December 2023, JAC announced that it has signed a cooperation agreement with Huawei. The two parties will collaborate in manufacturing, sales, and services to develop premium EV based on Huawei's intelligent automotive solutions.

In August 2024, at the Stelato S9 launch conference, Huawei officially announced the fourth brand of HIMA collaborated with JAC, the Maextro (Chinese: 尊界). The first vehicle, Maextro S800 is scheduled to roll off the production line by the end of 2024 and would be launched in the first half of 2025.


### Collaboration with Wrightbus

On 29 January 2025, Northern Irish bus manufacturer Wrightbus entered into truck manufacturing in collaboration with the JAC Group under the 'Rightech' sub-brand. The manufacturer launched the Rightech RT75, a 7.5 tonnes (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons) battery electric box truck based on the JAC Junling but modified with a revised front grille, which is able to be specified at either a 3.85 metres (12.6 ft) or 4.48 metres (14.7 ft) wheelbase and is available in both left- and right-hand drive variants for the UK and European truck markets.

### Sales outside China

JAC began the export of vehicles to Bolivia in 1990, later expanding to over one hundred countries. Light trucks are a popular export product.

Some JAC exports are in the form of knock-down kits, which are assembled at overseas factories in countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Mexico and Iran. As of 2010, a possible factory in Slovakia is under discussion. Such factories are not necessarily owned by or affiliated with JAC. Knock-down exports are an easy way to gain access to developing markets without added after-sales service costs.

In 2009, JAC started a partnership with a distributor in Brazil, the SHC group. As of early 2011, it had more than 10,000 firm orders from its Brazilian partner. JAC also had plans to build a production base in the country as of 2009. This plan remained active until at least 2011, at which time the plant was to be located in Bahia state and built in cooperation with the SHC group, which was to provide 80% of the initial investment.

In 2016, JAC entered the Philippines market through a local partner, selling heavy-duty trucks, and in 2018, passenger cars.ᵇᵉᵗᵗᵉʳˢᵒᵘʳᶜᵉⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2017, JAC announced a joint venture in Mexico with Giant Motors (company owned by tycoon Carlos Slim). A factory has been built at Ciudad Sahagún, in the State of Hidalgo. With a surface of 65,000 square meters, has two lines of production with a capacity of over 25,000 units per year. Since early June 2017, two models are sold in Mexican market: SEI2 and SEI3, both SUVs are made in Mexico in this facility, the compact sedan J4 was added to the line-up in 2018.
