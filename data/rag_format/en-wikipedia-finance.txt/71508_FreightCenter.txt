**FreightCenter** is a privately owned, non-asset based 3rd-party logistics provider (3PL) with headquarters in Palm Harbor, Florida, United States. FreightCenter acts as a conduit between freight carriers and commercial or residential shippers located in the United States and Canada. As a conduit, shippers use the provider's online freight quote calculator to calculate freight costs for less than truckload, truckload, rail, ocean and air freight.
