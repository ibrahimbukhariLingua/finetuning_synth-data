Reunification of Gran Colombia


# Reunification of Gran Colombia



**Reunification of Gran Colombia** refers to the potential future reunification of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama under a single government. Although Gran Colombia was dissolved in the 19th century, interest and efforts in reunification were expressed as early as 1903 when Panama separated from Colombia. People in favor for a reunification are called *"unionistas"* or unionists. In 2008, Hugo Chávez, president of Venezuela, announced the proposal of the political restoration of the Gran Colombia, under the Bolivarian Revolution.


## Today

Some commentators ʷʰᵒ? believe that a reunified Gran Colombia could become a global economic powerhouse. That would contrast with Gran Colombia in the 1820s, whose economy was mostly agrarian and had little industry.

Gran Colombia would have the world's 14th largest economy behind South Korea and the 12th largest population behind Mexico. By 2050, Gran Colombia would have nearly 150 million citizens. Gran Colombia would also be the world's 10th largest nation by size.
