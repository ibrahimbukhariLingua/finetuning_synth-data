## Career


### Early career

In 1958, O'Neil started his career as a stockbroker at Hayden, Stone & Company, and developed an investment strategy which made early use of computers. In 1960, he was accepted to Harvard Business School's first Program for Management Development (PMD). From his research, O'Neil invented the CAN SLIM strategy and became the top-performing broker in his firm. He bought a seat on the NYSE at age 30 and became the youngest at that time ever to do so. In 1963, he founded William O'Neil + Co. Inc., a company which developed the first computerized daily securities database and sold its research to institutional investors and tracks over 70,000 companies worldwide.

Daily Graphs was launched by William O'Neil to produce Daily Graphs, a printed book of stock charts delivered weekly to subscribers in 1972. In 1998, O'Neil launched Daily Graphs Online as a comprehensive online equity research tool and an extension of the Daily Graphs business he launched in 1972. In 2010, Daily Graphs Inc. and its service was re-branded as MarketSmith.

In 1973, he founded "O'Neil Data Systems, Inc.", to provide high-speed printing and database-publishing facilities. The company now operates as O'Neil Digital Solutions and has operations in Los Angeles, Dallas and Monroe, North Carolina. The firm provides data-driven publishing and marketing communications.


### *Investor's Business Daily*

In 1984, O'Neil made research from his database available in print form with the launch of *Investor's Daily*, a national business newspaper aimed to compete with *The Wall Street Journal*. In 1991, the publication's name was changed from *Investor's Daily* to *Investor's Business Daily*.

As of 2015, the newspaper had a circulation of 113,000 and its website attracted 2.9 million visitors a month. In 2016, the newspaper changed its printing schedule to weekly, but continued to publish news daily on its website.

In 2021 News Corp. bought *Investor’s* for $275 Million.


## Personal life

O'Neil was married and had four children. He stated in a 2002 interview that one of the books which was an early influence on him was Gerald Loeb's *The Battle for Investment Survival.* According to O'Neil, this is the best book on the market. Other investors he studied were Bernard Baruch, Jesse Livermore, Jack Dreyfus, and Nicolas Darvas. He also admired Thomas Edison.

In 2007, O'Neil started donating to his alma mater, Southern Methodist University and funded a chair in business journalism at SMU's Meadows School of the Arts. He then endowed a professorship in markets and freedom and created the William J. O'Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom at the university's Cox School of Business.

O'Neil died on May 28, 2023, at age 90. After his death, *Investor’s* released a special tribute to O’Neil’s “inspirational life.”
