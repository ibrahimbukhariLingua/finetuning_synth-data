The area is divided into two parts, consisting of the Lankaran lowland and the Talysh mountains. The mountainous part of the economic region is composed of the Talysh, Peshtasar, and Burovar ranges.

Talysh Mountains in the western part and the proximity of the Lankaran lowland to the Caspian Sea provide a diverse climate in the Lankaran economic region. Summer is hot and mostly dry.

The average January temperature is −2 to −4 °C, the absolute minimum temperature is −5 to −11 °C. The number of snowy days is between 10 and 30 days. Symptoms of subtropical climate gradually disappear in the areas where the rainfalls exceed 500 mm and the precipitation rises up to 400–600 mm, dry and hot summer dominates. In mountainous areas, summer is relatively cool; the average July temperature is 19–20 °C.

The region has a dense river network. The rivers of the district are fed mainly from rainwater. Several water reservoirs have been built on the rivers in order to supply the district with drinking and irrigation water.

But the plains-foothill zone of the region is covered with forest soil. In the Talysh mountains, the brown mountain-forest and mountain meadowlands are spread. The brown mountain-forest lands are formed in dry and warm climates (total precipitation is 400 mm, the average annual temperature is 12 °C). These lands are spread in the mid-mountainous and foothill zone of the economic region at altitudes of 600–1200 m.

Yellow soils in Azerbaijan are spread only in the foothills of the economic region and occupy 157,100 hectares or 1.8% of all the region's lands. These lands are formed in the Mediterranean type of humid subtropical climate with an average annual temperature of 14 °C and an annual rainfall of 1300–1900 mm (south). Most of the rainfall falls in the autumn and winter seasons. Yellow soils cover the Hirkan-type forests of chestnut oak trees.
