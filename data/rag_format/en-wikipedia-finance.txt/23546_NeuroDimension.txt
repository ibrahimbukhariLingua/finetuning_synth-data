## History


### Formation and NeuroSolutions

Prior to the acquisition of NeuroDimension (in 2016), it was a software development company headquartered in Gainesville, Florida and founded in 1991 by Steven Reid, MD, Jose Principe, PhD (Director of the Computational Neural Engineering Lab at the University of Florida) and Curt Lefebvre, PhD (CEO of nDimensional). Dr. Reid provided the initial capital to get the company off the ground. Dr. Principe provided the engineering staff with technical direction and had helped secure research grant funding for the company. Dr. Lefebvre was the principal author of the company’s core neural network technology.

The company was formed around a software tool, NeuroSolutions, which enables engineers and researchers to model their data using neural networks.


### Financial Analysis and TradingSolutions

In 1997, it became apparent that one of the most common uses of NeuroSolutions was to create neural network models to time the financial markets.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
