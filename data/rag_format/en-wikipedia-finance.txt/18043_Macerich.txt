## History

The company traces its antecedents to the **MaceRich Real Estate Company** founded in New York in 1964 by *Mace Siegel* and *Richard Cohen* who combined their first names to name their company.

In 1994, the company became a public company via an initial public offering.

In 2002, Macerich acquired Phoenix, Arizona-based Westcor for $1.475 billion. The purchase added 9 properties to Macerich's portfolio making them the largest mall owner in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area.

In 2005, the company acquired most of Rochester, New York-based Wilmorite Properties' portfolio for $2.333 billion, adding 11 shopping centers to Macerich's portfolio, including Tysons Corner Center in Tysons, Virginia.

In 2006, the company name was rebranded to "Macerich."

On April 1, 2015, the company rejected a $16.8 billion takeover offer from Simon Property Group, claiming that the offer undervalued the company. Simon withdrew the offer.

In November 2024, the company acquired 40% Stake in Pacific Premier Retail trust.
