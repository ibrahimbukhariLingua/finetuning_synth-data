## Controversies

In February 2022 Cedar missed interest payments of 20 billion yuan (US$3.15 billion) owed to clients, casting doubt on the soundness of the business; *The Nikkei* described it as being built on a "shell game," reporting that "Most of the goods traded by Cedar did not belong to Cedar, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The goods in warehouses belonged to state companies that sold them to Cedar and then bought them back after multiple rounds of transactions […] All transactions took place only on paper as the ownership of goods changed hands […] The goods could be sold hundreds of times in days without leaving a warehouse, boosting sales figures for the companies involved."
