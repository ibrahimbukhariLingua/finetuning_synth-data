Business continuance volume


# Business continuance volume



In disk arrays, a **business continuance volume** (**BCV**) is EMC Corporation's term for an independently addressable copy of a data volume, that uses advanced mirroring technique for business continuity purposes.


## Use

BCVs can be detached from the active data storage at a point in time and mounted on non-critical servers to facilitate offline backup or parallel computing.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Once offline processes are completed, these BCVs can be either:

* discarded
* used as a source to recover the production data
* re-attached (re-synchronized) to the production data again

## Types

There are two types of BCVs:

* A clone BCV is a traditional method, and uses one-to-one separate physical storage (splitable disk mirror)
 + least impact on production performance
 + high cost of the additional storage
 + persistent usage

* A snapshot BCV, that uses copy on write algorithm on the production volume
 + uses only a small additional storage, that only holds the changes made to the production volume
 - lower cost of the additional storage
 - reads and writes impact performance of production storage
 + once snapshot storage fills up, the snapshot becomes invalid and unusable
 + short-term usage
