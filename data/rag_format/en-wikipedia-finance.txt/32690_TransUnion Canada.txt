In 2012 Consumer Protection B.C issued a compliance order against Trans Union to remove all data it held over 6 years. Trans Union refused to comply with the compliance order as it felt obligated to report "substantiated facts" longer than six years. TransUnion requested a review of the compliance order, which led to court action. The BC Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the compliance order was lawful.
