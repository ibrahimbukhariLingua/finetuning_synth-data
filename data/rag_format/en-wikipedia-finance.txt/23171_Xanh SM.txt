## History

GSM was founded by Phạm Nhật Vượng with a charter capital of 3,000 billion VND, of which Phạm Nhật Vượng holds 95% of the shares. The company officially began operations in Hanoi on April 14, 2023.

Xanh SM Taxi was established in response to Vietnam's national goal on climate change, with efforts to reduce emissions from transportation vehicles.

On April 27, 2023, Xanh SM launched in Ho Chi Minh City. On October 13, Xanh SM deployed 150 VinFast electric cars (VF 5 Plus) to Laos, becoming an international electric ride-hailing company. On November 9, Xanh SM Laos launched in Vientiane.

As of May 2024, Xanh SM has over 30,000 electric taxis, accounting for more than 40% of the total taxis operating in Vietnam.

In December 2024, the company announced that VinFast has decided to withdraw its VF 8 electric vehicles from the GSM taxi service to reinforce the model’s premium market positioning. The VF 8 fleet will be transferred to FGF, a company specializing in the sale and rental of VinFast electric cars, to offer rental services to individuals and businesses or for direct sale to interested customers. GSM’s taxi services will continue with other VinFast models, including the VF 5 and VF e34.
