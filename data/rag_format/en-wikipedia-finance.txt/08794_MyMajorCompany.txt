## Company history

Since 2007, MyMajorCompany has been an independent record label. In hard times for the music industry, its co-funders began enrolling internet users in financing young artists. During its first year, MyMajorCompany raised one million Euros for artists including Gr√©goire (1.5 million albums sold), Irma, and Joyce Jonathan (both platinum-selling artists). In 2012, the company broadened its business model to include cinema, publishing, video games, arts, and entrepreneurship.
