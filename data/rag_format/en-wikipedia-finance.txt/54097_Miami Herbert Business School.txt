## History


### 20th century

Miami Herbert Business School was founded as the University of Miami School of Business concurrently with the University of Miami's founding in 1929. The school's founding came in the middle of a period of financial turmoil for the university and classes were initially held in the unfinished Anastasia Hotel, near the parcel of land that would later become the university's Coral Gables campus.


### 21st century

In 2017, University of Miami president Julio Frenk appointed former Harvard Business School senior associate dean and professor John Quelch as the school's dean and vice provost of executive education. Shortly after being hired, Quelch led a successful but short-lived initiative to change the school's name from the University of Miami School of Business Administration to Miami Business School. On October 15, 2019, the school's name changed again to honor Patti and Allan Herbert, a married alumni couple who have contributed approximately $100 million to the university over the course of their lifetimes. The school is currently known as the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School.

In December 2022, the University of Miami announced the departure of Quelch as the school's dean, and the appointment of Ann N. Olazabal, a professor of business law and ethics and the Herbert Business School's vice dean of Lifelong Learning and Executive Education, as his interim replacement. In January 2023, the university began a search for a permanent replacement. On July 1, 2024, Paul A. Pavlou, formerly dean of the University of Houston's business school, began his tenure as Miami Herbert's new dean.

Since its 1929 founding, Miami Herbert Business School has graduated 45,000 alumni from 130 countries, including several who have gone on to high-profile management and other leadership capacities in U.S. and global business, government, academia, thought leadership, and other business or business-related fields.
