United States v. Drescher


# United States v. Drescher



***United States v. Drescher***, 179 F.2d 863 (2nd Cir. 1950) was a United States income tax case before the Second Circuit. The Court held as follows:

* The value of the employer-purchased annuities in question was taxable as part of taxpayer's gross income in the year in which the annuities were purchased.

* The annuities in question were nonassignable, and possession was retained by the employer until taxpayer reached age of retirement; and the employee's compensation was not reduced during these years, nor did he have election to receive in cash the amount paid.


## Facts

A corporation, anticipating its executive's retirement, purchases an "endowment policy," entitling him (the policy-holder) to a lump-sum-certain when he retires in 15 years.


## Held

The executive must include the premium immediately, as his "basis" for his new policy.


## Academic commentary

The stakes for the government are as follows:

* Due to the declining present value of future money, a taxpayer pays less in taxes if he can defer his tax payment.
* In the case of this endowment policy:
 + If the Premium = $B, the [lump sum] will be $[B\*(1+i)^Y].
 + If deferral is permitted, the executive's tax savings = (marginal rate R)\*[lump sum]
* Reasons in favor of deferral: it was issued to the company in the interim; and, unlike the stock bonus above, his rights are nonforfeitable: he can't sell/borrow against it, nor can he be denied it by being fired.
* Reasons against deferral: it names him as the beneficiary; he should feel better off at issuanceâ€”and he certainly consented to the policy purchase in lieu of salary (e.g. as consideration).
