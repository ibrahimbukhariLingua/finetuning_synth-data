## Career

Stone is the CEO and founder of SS&C Technologies, which he started out of his home in Connecticut in 1986.


### Pre-SS&C Career

Before founding SS&C Technologies, Stone began his career in 1977 at KPMG, a financial services consultancy and accounting firm in St. Louis, Missouri. Stone would eventually become a director at KPMG and move to Hartford, Connecticut where the company is headquartered.

While at KPMG, Stone also served as a vice president of administration and special investment services at The Advest Group, which at the time was the 12th largest broker-dealer in the United States.


### Founding SS&C Technologies

By 1986, Stone had saved up about $20,000 from his time working at KPMG. That year, the then 30-year-old Stone left his job to start SS&C out of his garage. The company launched with just four employees but quickly grew to 17 the next year before more than doubling in 1988.

Over the next decade, SS&C Technologies grew to reach revenues of $18 million from the sales and development of software for financial institutions. SS&C Technologies’ clients included asset managers, bankers and insurers who were looking to manage their books digitally.

SS&C Technologies went public in 1996 with Stone navigating the firm's initial public offering (IPO). His next big challenge came at the turn of the century when the dot-com bust sent ripples throughout the economy. In response, Stone took the company private in 2005.

Stone took the company public for the second time in March 2010.

In May 2018, Stone and his wife Mary donated $15 million toward a multi-institutional initiative in downtown Evansville, Stone Family Center for Health Sciences. The center was a collaborative effort among the University of Evansville, the University of Southern Indiana and Indiana University to support health sciences programs.
