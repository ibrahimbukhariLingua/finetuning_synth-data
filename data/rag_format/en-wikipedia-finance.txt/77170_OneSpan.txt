## History

In 1984, T. Kendall Hunt founded Vasco as a consulting and software services company for corporate and governmental agencies. In 1991, the company acquired ThumbScan, which claimed to have the first fingerprint reader device for a computer.

In 1993, the company was renamed Vasco Data Security International and expanded its offerings to include data security. Vasco was incorporated in 1997 and held its initial public offering in January 2000.

Vasco started developing its Digipass technology in the early 2000s. The company marketed the technology internationally in Belgium. In 2009, Vasco announced that Digipass two-factor authentication was available in the App Store for iPhone and iPod Touch. *Forbes* recognized Vasco on its list of "America's Fastest-Growing Tech Companies" that year.

In 2006, Vasco acquired LOGiCO Smart Card Solutions, a privately-owned company located in Austria offering smart card–based authentication and PKI solutions.

In January 2011, Vasco acquired DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority. In June 2011, DigiNotar was hacked and started issuing false security certificates. When the news broke, all issued certificates were cancelled and the company went bankrupt.

In 2013, Vasco announced its acquisition of the Cambridge-based technology company Cronto. The patented CrontoSign solution uses specialized color bar codes, so-called Cronto Visual Cryptograms (or photoTAN), to mitigate MITB Trojan malware.

The company established its international headquarters at Dubai Silicon Oasis in 2012. Vasco announced that it would lower EMEA channel entry for VARs at that time. It became a member of the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance in June 2014 and was later recognized by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for User Authentication.

In 2014, the company acquired Risk IDS, Ltd., a provider of risk-based authentication solutions to the global banking community. By 2015, IDENTIKEY Risk Manager (IRM) was released as a comprehensive risk management solution to improve the methods and speed of organizations to detect fraud.

In October 2015, Vasco acquired Silanis Technology, a Canadian document e-signature company, for US$113 million. By early 2016, the company's cloud electronic signature software, eSignLive, was updated to include integration with Salesforce. Vasco announced a face recognition authentication feature for Digipass in May 2016. The company has partnerships with financial institutions including HSBC Bank USA, Fedict, Rabobank, Arab Bank and Riyadh Bank.

In May 2018, the company acquired Dealflo, a UK and Canada-based financial agreement automation software company, for GB£41 million.
