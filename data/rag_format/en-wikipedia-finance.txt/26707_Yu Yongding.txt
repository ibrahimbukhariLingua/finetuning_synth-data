## Policy advice

Yu Yongding has long been involved and influential in Chinese and international monetary, fiscal and macroeconomic policy debates.

Yu has favored China's adjustment of overseas assets and liabilities, as well as the strengthening of capital controls, to improve the security and performance of China's overseas assets.²⁰³ Yu views China's large holdings of US treasuries as a "grotesque misallocation of resources" given that their real net investment income to China has been negative for almost two decades.²⁰³ Yu also notes that the dollar is depreciating in real terms because of the US's rising national debt and the US Federal Reserve's expansionary monetary policy.²⁰³ Yu's view is that the US has already "stopped playing by the monetary rules."²⁰³ Accordingly, Yu favors moving China's foreign exchange reserves away from dollar-denominated assets and instead invest increasingly in raw energy and materials.²⁰³–²⁰⁴

Yu supports China's economic strategy of dual circulation.⁴² In Yu's view, the initial reason to develop dual circulation was for economic benefit.⁴⁵ Following United States President Donald Trump's emphasis on decoupling the U.S. from China and the U.S. government placing Chinese companies on its entities list, Yu's view is that dual circulation has now also become a matter of security for China.⁴⁵ To counter U.S. efforts to decouple, Yu advocates policy he describes using the metaphors of "spare wheels" and "body-lock" (the latter metaphor drawn from the sport of wrestling).⁴⁷ "Spare wheels" can include a variety of policy measures, such as providing support to China's high-tech national champions or long-term efforts to encourage the development of domestic engineering talent.⁴⁷ The "body-lock" involves China opposing efforts to isolate or sanction it by actively building links in other countries, including with U.S. business, in the hope that these cooperative activities will develop constituencies opposed to isolating China.⁴⁷–⁴⁸
