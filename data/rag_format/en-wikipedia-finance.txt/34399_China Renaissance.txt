**China Renaissance** is a Chinese financial services company. Founded by Bao Fan in 2005 as a financial advisory firm, China Renaissanceâ€™s core business now consists of investment banking, investment management and wealth management.


## Background

In 2010, China Renaissance launched K2VC, a venture capital firm.

In 2018, China Renaissance was listed on the Main Board of Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

In February 2023, the BBC and other sources reported that Bao had been missing for two days and they were unsure of his whereabouts. The disappearance has caused the stock of China Renaissance to drop by 50 percent, though the company said in a statement that Operations would "continue normally". Later, the company announced that Bao was taken by the Chinese authorities as a part of an investigation targeting Bao's former colleague and the company's former president, Cong Lin.

In February 2024, Bao resigned from all of his roles at China Renaissance.

The company has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and New York City.
