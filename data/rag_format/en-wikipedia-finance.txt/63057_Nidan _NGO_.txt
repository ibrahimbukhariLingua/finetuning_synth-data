## Chakachak Patna

The city of Patna generated 700 to 800 tonnes per day of municipal solid waste, and prior to 2008 had no door-to-door waste collection.

Nidan formed self-help groups and supported them with micro credit financing. They piloted an initiative, ‘Chakachak Patna’ with door-to-door waste collection for 300 households. This was done by a professional workforce of *safai mitras* (cleanliness friends).

The Patna Municipal Corporation recognized the value of this service and contracted Nidan to scale up operations to 5,000 households in 2008, by collecting a fee of INR 20 to 30 per month per household.

Nidan operations steadily grew to 63,000 households in 2014 and it increased its workforce for Chakachak Patna from 4 to 332. Due to the value of the service, the fee increased to 30 INR 70 per month per household.

As many of the *safai mitras* were women, Nidan also set up 10 creches to support 300 working women.
