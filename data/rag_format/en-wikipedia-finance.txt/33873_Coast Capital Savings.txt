## History

Concerned about the uncertain financial future following the Great Depression, when money was hard to come by, groups of individuals on B.C.'s Vancouver Island, neighbouring Gulf Islands, and the Greater Vancouver cities of Richmond and Surrey formed small financial co-ops focused on helping their neighbours and colleagues obtain the financial assistance they required to better their lives.

Coast Capital Savings Credit Union was created out of a merger on December 31, 2000 between Pacific Coast Savings Credit Union and Richmond Savings Credit Union. At the time, the merged entity's $3.2 billion in assets made it the second largest credit union in Canada behind Vancity's $6.4 billion. In June 2002, Coast Capital Savings acquired Surrey Metro Savings, expanding the reach of the credit union from Vancouver Island to the Fraser Valley.

In the years that followed the merger with Surrey Metro Savings, Coast Capital Savings membership grew from 300,000 members in 2002 to nearly 600,000 members in 2021. The asset base of the credit union increased from $6.1 billion to over $22 billion between 2002 and 2023.

From October 17 to November 28, 2016, a vote was held for members on whether Coast Capital Savings should become a federal credit union. 79.2% of the 79,726 voting members voted in favour, with the announcement coming from a Special General Meeting held on December 14, 2016. Coast Capital Savings is the second federal credit union, after New Brunswick's Fédération des caisses populaires acadiennes (UNI) in July 2016. Pursuant to a federal letters patent, Coast Capital was renamed Coast Capital Savings Federal Credit Union (and in French *Coopérative de crédit fédérale Coast Capital Savings*) effective November 1, 2018.

In June 2018, Coast Capital became a Certified B Corporation and successfully recertified in late 2021. Coast Capital earned an overall score of 112.8 in 2021, an 11.9 point increase over its 2018 result.
