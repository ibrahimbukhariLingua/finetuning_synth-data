## History

The bank was founded on May 20, 1953, with 27 employees, as the Bank of the Gold Coast. Initially, it focused on serving Ghanaian traders, farmers, and business people, who could not obtain financing from the expatriate banks. In 1957, when Ghana attained Independence, the bank re-branded to Ghana Commercial Bank, to concentrate on commercial banking, since Bank of Ghana had been created to function as the central bank and banking regulator.

In the beginning, the bank was wholly owned by the Government of Ghana. However, in 1996, when government shareholding stood at 51.17%, the stock of the bank was listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange. In 2013, the bank renamed itself GCB Bank Ltd, with a new brand identity which was launched at the end of 2014. Today, GCB Bank Ltd serves the banking needs of large corporations, parastatal companies, small and medium enterprises as well as individuals. As of December 2016ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the bank employs 1,532 staff, in branches distributed in all 10 regions of the Republic of Ghana.

With a minimum investment of GHS 100, the trust offers a diversified portfolio of local and international assets, including government securities, corporate bonds, equities, and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
