# List of markets in London



This is a **list of markets in London**. Greater London is home to a wealth of covered, outdoor and street markets. Many specialise in a particular type of goods or sell different things on different days. Most open very early in the morning and close early or late afternoon.

Markets in London have their origins in the Middle Ages and ancient charter; set up to serve the population of the City of London. Over time, some emerged as wholesale markets serving specific market segments — such as the sale of vegetables, meat, or fish. With an expanding metropolis in the 18th and 19th centuries, street markets were set up to meet the needs of the new suburbs. With the introduction of trams on the streets of London, these were moved (sometimes forcibly) into neighbouring side streets, or new covered markets.

The modern markets are regulated by the City and 32 London boroughs. Many have become 'general markets' proffering a range of goods.


## Wholesale markets

These markets have ancient origins and connections with the City of London. Some have moved from their original locations within the city boundaries but most continue to be operated by the City of London Corporation:

* New Covent Garden Market is the largest fruit, vegetable and flower market in the UK. With over 200 businesses, employing over 2,500 people, the Market supplies 40% of the fresh fruit & vegetables eaten outside of the home in London and is used by 75% of London florists. With a large range of food businesses, including traditional wholesalers, wholesale distributors and food processors, NCGM serves many of London's best restaurants and hotels, cafés and bars, schools, hospitals and work places as well as independent retailers and street markets.
* Borough Market is located in The Borough, just south of London Bridge. The market was established on London Bridge and is first recorded in 1014. It has been in several locations, but moved to its present site in 1870. It was owned by the City Corporation and was transferred to an independent trust in 1999. It still operates as a wholesale market, but when this closes it sells a wide range of sundry food items.
* Old Billingsgate Market, a fish market, relocated in 1982 to Billingsgate Market, Poplar. The original elegant building facing the river is now used as a hospitality and events venue.
