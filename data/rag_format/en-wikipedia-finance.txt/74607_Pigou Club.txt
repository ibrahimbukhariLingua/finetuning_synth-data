Pigou Club


# Pigou Club



The **Pigou Club** is described by its creator, economist Gregory Mankiw, as a “group of economists and pundits with the good sense to have publicly advocated higher Pigouvian taxes, such as gasoline taxes or carbon taxes." A Pigouvian tax is a tax levied to correct the negative externalities (negative side-effects) of a market activity. These ideas are also known as an ecotaxes or green tax shifts.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
