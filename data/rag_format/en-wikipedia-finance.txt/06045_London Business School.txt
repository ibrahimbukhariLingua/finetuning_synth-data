London Business School


# London Business School



**London Business School** (**LBS**) is a business school and a constituent college of the federal University of London. LBS was founded in 1964 and awards post-graduate degrees (Master's degrees in management and finance, MBA and PhD). Its motto is "To have a profound impact on the way the world does business".

The main campus is located at Sussex Place in London, adjacent to Regent's Park. In 2012, the school acquired the Marylebone Town Hall and spent £60 million to refurbish it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70% - the new building is called The Sammy Ofer Centre. In 2017, it was announced that LBS had also acquired the site of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who vacated the building in November 2019.
LBS has a secondary campus in Dubai that is dedicated to Executive Education and the Dubai EMBA.


## History


### Foundation

London Business School was founded in 1964 under the name of the '*London Graduate School of Business Studies',* with Dr. Arthur Earle as Dean. In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the University of London as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School's first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the School's Regent's Park campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the *London Business School* and was incorporated by Royal Charter, which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen's Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the Columbia Business School.

In 2007 a new campus was opened in Dubai to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the University of Hong Kong and Columbia Business School, and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent. The building was renamed "The Sammy Ofer Centre" in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017. In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.

With the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a £100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised £98 million, £40 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with £28 million for research, £18 million in scholarships for students, £10 million to increase the school's endowment, and £4 million to improve technology across the school. By June 2016, the school had raised £125 million, including two £25 million gifts from alumni Jim Ratcliffe and Idan Ofer.

François Ortalo-Magné, the French-born former Dean of the Wisconsin School of Business, succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017. In January 2024, it was announced that the Russian economist Sergei Guriev, previously the provost of the Institut d’études politiques in Paris (Sciences Po) would take over from Ortalo-Magné at the beginning of the 2024/2025 academic year, also joining the university's faculty as a professor of Economics. Guriev took up his post on 1 August 2024.


## Campus

The campus is at Sussex Place in Marylebone, on the perimeter of Regent's Park.

The business school has redeveloped the Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices at the Sammy Ofer Centre. It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).

## Academics


### Master in Business Administration (MBA)

The school's flagship programme is its full-time 15–21-month Master of Business Administration degree. MBA students take a prescribed set of core courses then choose from roughly 70 different electives. Class size has been around 400 students in every annual cohort. These are broken into 5 streams of approximately 80 students who take all core courses together.

Beyond academics, the school puts an emphasis on personal and professional development including leadership, global awareness, and business skill building. These developments are facilitated via specialized workshops led by external consultants, students, and faculty. In addition to a range of elective courses at the London Business School, the school has partnerships with around 32 exchange schools around the world. Each academic year around 100 students spend a term at another leading business school.

The MBA Programme has one of the world's largest international exchange programmes. Each year approximately 35 per cent of second-year MBAs spend a term abroad at one of over 30 partner schools, including NYU Stern School of Business, IESE Business School, Booth School of Business of The University of Chicago, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA Anderson School of Management, the MIT Sloan School of Management, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, Columbia Business School, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, Indian School of Business among others.


### Executive MBA

The school offers four Executive (part-time) MBA degrees, which are completed in 16–20 months. At an academic level, the school offers the same degree to both Executive (part-time) and full-time MBA students. The programmes involve very similar core courses to the full-time MBA, international field work and a wide range of elective courses. The course ends with a capstone together with company project or management report.

* **Executive MBA (London)**.
* **Executive MBA (Dubai)**. The programme begins with an orientation week in London. Following this, students take 10 core modules, which are taught in a four- or five-day block each month in Dubai. Students then undertake electives, which are primarily offered in London, and an international assignment. Two additional core modules take place in London.
* **EMBA-Global Americas and Europe**. A further 140 executives are enrolled in the dual-degree EMBA-Global Programme. It is taught in partnership with Columbia Business School. Graduates are awarded degrees from both universities. The first year involves week-long modules each month alternating between London and New York. In the second year, students select from the full range of electives available at the participating schools.
* **EMBA-Global Asia**. launched in 2008 jointly with Hong Kong University and Columbia. Teaching takes place at all three business schools. While the first year is modelled on the transatlantic EMBA-Global, the school states that because "EMBA-Global Asia is designed for people who have or will have significant trans-national responsibilities, all courses reflect a greater proportion of global material".
