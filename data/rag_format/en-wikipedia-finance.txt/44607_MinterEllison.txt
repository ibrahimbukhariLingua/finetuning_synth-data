# MinterEllison



**MinterEllison** is a multinational law firm, and professional services firm, based in Australia. The firm has thirteen offices and operates in five countries. By number of lawyers it is the largest law firm in Australia.


## History

MinterEllison is considered a leading law firm, known as one of the *Big Six* law firms in Australia.

The firm's origins trace back to Minter, Simpson & Co, founded in 1827, and Perkins, Stevenson & Linton, founded in 1853. Its first international office was London in 1974. Its ties to China began in the 1980s.

In 1984 Minter, Simpson and Co and Perkins, Stevenson & Linton merged to form Minter Simpson. In 1986, Ellison Hewison & Whitehead merged with Gillotts and with Minter Simpson to become Minter Ellison. In October 1992, Minter Ellison and Morris Fletcher & Cross merged to form Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher, the fourth largest law firm in Australia.

The firm established offices in Hong Kong in 2000, Shanghai in 2001, and Beijing in 2010.

In 2015, MinterEllison moved into new premises at the Governor Macquarie Tower in Sydney and Collins Arch in Melbourne.

In March 2015, the firm dropped "lawyers" from its name. This was part of a strategy of diversification into non-legal professional services such as consulting and project management. Then Chief Executive Tony Harrington said these changes were aimed at adapting to "phenomenal change in the market... (including) increased in-house capacity at clients, and ever-consolidating larger businesses."

In April 2016, it launched an alternative cost contract service called 'Flex'. In October 2016, it announced an expansion into non-legal consulting.

The firm acquired ITNewcom, a boutique technology consulting firm on 1 July 2017.
