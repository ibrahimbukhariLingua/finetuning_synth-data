### A.S. Roma

Pallotta, along with three other American investors (Thomas R. DiBenedetto, Michael Ruane and Richard D'Amore) acquired Serie A football club A.S. Roma in 2011.

After becoming one of the owners in 2011, in August 2012, Pallotta became the chairman of club, succeeding Thomas R. DiBenedetto, and becoming the 23rd in the club's history. During Pallotta's ownership, the club would primarily engage in capitalizing on the sale of its players, leading AS Roma to obtain over half a billion in capital gains on player trading operations, which earned Pallotta the nickname of “King of capital gains”. This financial approach to football, coupled with one of AS Roma's longest period without winning any trophies, as well as what many considered an undeserved dismissal of AS Roma icons Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi, lead to a serious clash with the fans and the only worldwide protest in AS Roma history, with disapproving banners in several remote parts of the world.

In December 2019, Pallotta was in final negotiations to sell the team for $872 million, to American businessman Dan Friedkin.
In August 2020, Friedkin signed the preliminary contract to agree to pay $591 million to Pallotta, the main shareholder of Roma. As the club's balance sheets later revealed, AS Roma had tremendous debt and seriously risked bankruptcy before having to be transferred to a new ownership in 2020.
