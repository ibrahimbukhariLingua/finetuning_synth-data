# Gulf International Bank



**Gulf International Bank** (**GIB**) (Arabic: بنك الخليج الدولي) was established in 1976 during the first oil boom and is incorporated in the Kingdom of Bahrain as a conventional wholesale bank. It is licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain and is headquartered in Manama in Bahrain.

Gulf International Bank, through its subsidiaries, provides its services in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and internationally. The company offers structured financing and advisory services for corporate and institutional customers in various sectors, including oil and gas, LNG, petrochemicals, power and water, infrastructure, telecom and technology-based projects, and aircraft and ships; and underwrites and arranges limited-recourse term financing with a range of debt finance products, such as syndicated debt finance, Islamic finance, export credit, and capital markets. It also provides a range of financial advisory services. In addition, the company offers asset and fund management services to the Middle East semi-governmental institutions and European financial institutions.

Our funding profile continues to strengthen, with growing access to stable and less costly funding through meem digital banking, and the global transaction banking business. Customer deposits increased 16 percent to US$21.2 billion, constituting 96 percent of total deposits, and exceeding loans and advances by more than 2 times. At the end of 2019, the Group’s Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) stood at a particularly high 163 percent compared to the Central Bank of Bahrain’s mandated regulatory minimum of 100 percent. This strong ratio reflected the high level of stable funding maintained by each entity within the GIB Group. Stable funding was enhanced by senior term finance of US$3.5 billion at the 2019-year end.
