## History

The present-day City College started as City School, founded on 6 January 1879, by the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. It was raised at a college in 1881. B.A.Classes were introduced in 1884; a Law Department came up in 1885, and M.A. classes were introduced and conducted until the new regulations of Calcutta University terminated them.

Initially, the college was housed in an old building, but afterwards it was shifted to another old house at 13, Mirzapur Street (now Surya Sen Street). A new building was erected in its place, opened by Lord Ripon, Governor-General of India, in 1884. In 1905, the college was brought under the control of a society called 'The City College Institution', now known as the 'Brahmo Samaj Education Society', whose chief objective was to promote the cause of education as an all-encompassing process to contribute towards the all-round development and well-being of the human community.

The City College Commerce Department came up in 1939 (18.07.1939) in response to the large-scale demand among the youth of the time for quality university education in commerce. In 1940, a Commercial Bureau was set up, and in 1945, the Department of Commerce and Business Administration was formally organized. The college got affiliated with the University of Calcutta in 1961, and was also officially recognized by University Grants’ Commission in the same year under the U.G.C. Act [Section 2(f)].


## Relation with Brahmo Samaj

The first phase of the history of the Brahmo Samaj is inextricably associated with the name of Raja Rammohan Roy (1772–1833). The Brahmo Samaj, launched on 20 August 1828, gave a concrete expression to his concept of universal worship. Their liberal approach is reflected in the fact that they arranged to have the Upanishads read and explained before the entire body of worshippers, which, besides the non-Brahmins, sometimes included Christians and Muslims.

After the departure of Raja Rammohan Roy for England (November 1830) and his death there (September 1833), the Brahmo Samaj as an organization faced a severe crisis for survival. However, the selfless efforts of Dwarakanath Tagore and Pandit Ram Chandra Vidyavagis enabled the Samaj to tide over the crisis. After founding the Tattwabodhini Sabha in 1839, Debendranath Tagore joined the Samaj in 1842 and it became the common platform for the intellectual and cultural elite of the mid-19th century Bengal. The era of the Tattwabodhini Sabha (1839–1859) thus marks a creative phase in the history of the Brahmo Samaj.

The Brahmo Movement gained further momentum when the dynamic Keshab Chandra Sen (1838–84) joined the Samaj in 1857. However, serious differences regarding ideology and attitude cropped up between Debendranath and Keshab. It came to a head at the close of 1866 with the emergence of two bodies, the Calcutta, or Adi Brahmo Samaj, and the Brahmo Samaj of India. A number of radical and far-reaching social reforms like female education and the total eradication of class distinctions led to the formation of the Indian Reform Association in 1870 and the enactment of the Indian Marriage Act, initially drafted as the Brahmo Marriage Act, in 1872, which validated inter-caste marriage. Again, Keshab's reverence for all faiths allowed him to achieve a rich synthesis of all religions, which he proclaimed under the title of 'New Dispensation' (Navavidhan) on 25 January 1880.

In spite of all such developments, a second schism took place in the Samaj in May 1878, when a band of Keshab Chandra Sen's followers left him to start Sadharon Brahmo Samaj. Led by Shiv Chandra Deb, the body consisted of some brilliant names like Sivanath Sastri, Ananda Mohan Bose, Vijay Krishna Goswami and others. It has proved till now a powerful branch of the Bramho Samaj in India. Presently both the wings, viz., the Brahmo Samaj of India and the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, contribute immensely to the well-being and needs of the entire Brahmo community in India.
