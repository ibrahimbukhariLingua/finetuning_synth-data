### Book recognition

While retained by the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association, Grunstein focused on developing the structure and financing package that would help tenants buy the complex and keep their apartments affordable. On October 21, 2009, the Court of Appeals ruled that Tishman Speyer, the owner of the complex, had no right to take the apartments out of the rent stabilization program. Grunstein had uncovered an "arcane" rent rule that did not allow an owner to take apartments from rent stabilization while also receiving a tax break for renovations, called the J-51 Program. Stuyvesant Town owners had been doing so for years. Grunstein's work earned him recognition in *New York Times* real estate reporter Charles Bagli's 2013 book, *Other People's Money: Inside the Housing Crisis and the Demise of the Greatest Real Estate Deal Ever Made*.
