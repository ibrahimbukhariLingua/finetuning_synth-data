Open Collective


# Open Collective



**Open Collective** is a crowdfunding platform focused on grassroots groups. It gives organizations, communities, projects to get a legal status and raise funding through subscription or one time payment. It's particularly favoured by open source projects. It currently hosts funding for thousands of open-source communities.


## History

Open Collective is a venture capital-funded tech startup—owned by founders, investors, and employees—with an obligation to make returns.

Projects with corporate support tend to rack up higher financing than donation projects led by individuals.

Open Collective Foundation, distinct from the Open Collective platform, announced the dissolution of its fiscal sponsorship program by the end of 2024.
