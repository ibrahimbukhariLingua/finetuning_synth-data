## History

The Development Finance Company of Uganda Limited was established in 1964, with its name changing in 2000 to DFCU Limited and eventually to dfcu Limited. In 2000, dfcu Limited acquired Gold Trust Bank, which subsequently became dfcu Bank.

In July 2014, the BoU transferred to dfcu Bank the customer deposits of the Global Trust Bank, a small retail financial institution that the BoU had closed because it never became commercially viable. The deposits were valued at UGX:73 billion.

On 27 January 2017, dfcu Bank took over Crane Bank, which had been under the statutory management of the BoU because Crane's liabilities exceeded its assets. The acquisition included all customer deposit accounts and some loan accounts.
