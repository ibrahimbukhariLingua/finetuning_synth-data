## Reforms of 2011

In March 2011, the Dutch coalition government announced a new gambling framework which in 2015 will open the country's online gambling market (including casinos, lotteries, poker, sportsbooks and bingo) to licensed domestic and foreign gaming establishments.
The ultimate goal of the new Remote Gambling Act is to better protect the player while gambling online. Many online gamblers currently use foreign websites, so protection by the Dutch government is not guaranteed. The law should change this. The ultimate goal is to allow more than 80% of Dutch online gamblers to gamble legally in the Netherlands. Three different innovations have been set up by the Gaming Authority for this purpose.
