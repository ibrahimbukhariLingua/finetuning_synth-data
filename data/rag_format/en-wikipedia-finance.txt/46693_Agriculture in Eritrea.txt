Agriculture is one of the main economic activities in Eritrea. Agriculture made up 20% of the country its GDP in 2021. Eritrea has 565,000 hectares (1,396,000 acres) of arable land and permanent crops. 70% of the Eritrean workforce is employed in agriculture, accounting for roughly one-third of the economy. Eritrea's main agricultural products include sorghum, millet, barley, wheat, legumes, vegetables, fruits, sesame, linseed, cattle, sheep, goats, and camels.


## History

Agriculture in Eritrea has experienced extensive improvement over recent years. After the Eritrean War of Independence, agriculture was one of the many sectors that was completely destroyed. Since then, significant investments have been made into the industryâ€”purchases worth millions of dollars of agricultural machinery have been made and hundreds of dams have been built.
