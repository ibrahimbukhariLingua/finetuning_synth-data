## Controversy

Until 2011, Defterios had been president of production company FactBased Communications (FBC), which had led a covert campaign since 2008 to generate media coverage favorable to the Malaysian government of the time. Upon discovery that several of their programs were part of the campaign, the BBC and CNBC abruptly canceled them. Shortly after leaving FBC, Defterios began reporting on the Middle East for CNN, and in July conducted an interview with then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. One week earlier, Malaysian security forces had arrested hundreds of protesters demanding electoral reform, and critics accused Defterios of asking him softball questions. As of August the same year, Defterios was still listed as a director and shareholder at FBC in company information filed with the UK Companies House. Defterios received CNN's support, which noted that he was not in violation of its rules at the time.


## Personal life

Defterios married Manuela Mirkos, at the time an employee of *The New York Times*, in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on the island of Sifnos in 2002. He lives in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and once reported to CNN on a regular basis from their London offices.
