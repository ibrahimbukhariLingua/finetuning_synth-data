Banking in Cuba


# Banking in Cuba



This article discusses **banking in Cuba** and gives an overview of the recent past. For details on the Cuban economy in general, see *economy of Cuba*.


## History

Following the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s, the Cuban banking sector came under the control of the new regime. The new authorities famously appointed Che Guevara as President of the National Bank of Cuba (Spanish: *Banco Nacional de Cuba*) in 1959. Guevara often retold the apocryphal story of how he gained the job at the bank; Fidel Castro had asked if there were an *economista* in the room and he had put his hand up – much to Castro's surprise. Guevara had mistakenly thought that Castro had asked for a *comunista*.

Guevara's appointment seemed somewhat ironic, as he often condemned money, favored its abolition, and showed his disdain by signing Cuban banknotes with his nickname, "Che."

The 1990s saw the restructuring of the Cuban banking system, with new commercial banks created, and a new central bank, "Banco Central de Cuba" set up. The architect of this restructuring, Francisco Soberón, became the first president of the new central bank.


## Central Bank of Cuba

The **Central Bank of Cuba** (Spanish: ***Banco Central de Cuba*** - "BCC") functions as the central bank of Cuba. The Cuban government set it up in 1997 to take over many of the functions of the *National Bank of Cuba* (Spanish: *Banco Nacional de Cuba* - BNC). Francisco Soberón Valdés served as the Bank's President from its creation until he stepped down in 2009. He was replaced by Ernesto Medina, who had served as president of the state-run Banco Financiero Internacional since 2003 The President of the Central Bank serves *ex officio* as a member of the Council of Ministers of Cuba.

As with most Cuban government ministries, the Central Bank acts as both banking regulator and shareholder of much of the Cuban banking system.
