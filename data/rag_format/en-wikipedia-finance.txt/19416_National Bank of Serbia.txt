## Headquarters building

The current headquarters building on Slavija Square was designed by architect Grujo Golijanin for the National Bank of Yugoslavia, for which construction started in the early 1990s. It stopped, however, because of Serbia's financial and political challenges of the time. Works restarted in the 2000s and the building was inaugurated in 2006.
