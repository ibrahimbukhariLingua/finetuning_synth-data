Tiger Resort Leisure and Entertainment was granted a license to operate a casino within the Entertainment City in 2008. In June 2016, the casino complex then named as Manila Bay Resorts was re-branded as Okada Manila.

The facility is intended to be used by Okada to compete with casinos in Macau and to position Metro Manila as a regional and international destination. The casino was set to open in November 2016 but the opening was later delayed due to worse-than-expected weather conditions.

The Fountain, was officially opened on March 31, 2017, to invited guests. On the next day, the casino opened the attraction to the general public.

Kazuo Okada was removed as board chairman of Tiger Resort in 2017 after the Universal Entertainment Corporation its parent firm alleged he has misappropriate funds. Okada continue's to claim that he is the rightful head of Tiger Resort and filed legal charges against the board while the casino continued to operate.
