Georgian kuponi


# Georgian kuponi



The **kuponi** (Georgian: კუპონი *k’up’oni*, "coupon"; ISO 4217: GEK) was the currency of Georgia. It was introduced on 5 April 1993, replacing the Russian ruble at par. This currency was temporary, with no coins nor subdivisions. It also suffered from hyperinflation.


## Banknotes

Kuponi banknotes were issued in five series: four in 1993 and one in 1994. Each denomination was introduced in no more than two series.


### First 1993 series


### Second 1993 series


### Third 1993 series


### Fourth 1993 series


### 1994 series


## Abandonment

On 2 October 1995, the government of Eduard Shevardnadze replaced the provisional coupon currency with the lari, at a rate of one million to one. It has remained fairly stable since then.
