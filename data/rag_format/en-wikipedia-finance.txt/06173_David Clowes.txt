## Derby County F.C.

On 26 June 2022, after Clowes had purchased Pride Park Stadium, his bid to buy the club was accepted, and Quantuma granted Clowes preferred bidder status. The administrators said Clowes's offer complied with EFL insolvency policy, meaning Derby would avoid a further points deduction. The deal, and the club's exit from administration, was eventually confirmed on 1 July 2022, though some constraints on transfers were agreed by the EFL and Derby's new owners. The club's transfer embargo was finally lifted in May 2023.

In June 2023, Clowes said that had he not taken over the club, they might have entered liquidation a week later.
