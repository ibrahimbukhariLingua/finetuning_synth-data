Nepalese mohar


# Nepalese mohar



The **mohar** was the currency of the Kingdom of Nepal from the second half of the 17th century until 1932. Silver and gold mohars were issued, each subdivided into 128 *dams*. Copper dams were also issued, together with copper *paisa* worth 4 copper dams. The values of the copper, silver and gold coinages relative to one another were not fixed until 1903. In that year, the silver mohar became the standard currency, divided into 50 paisa. It was replaced in 1932 by the rupee, also called the *mohru* (Moru), at a rate of 2 mohars = 1 rupee.


## Coins


In the reign of Girvan Yuddha (1799–1816), copper coins were issued for 1 and 2 dam and 2 paisa, with silver coins for 1 dam, 1⁄32, 1⁄16, 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 3⁄4, 1, 1+1⁄2 and 3 mohar and gold coins for 1 dam, 1⁄32, 1⁄16, 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, 1+1⁄2 and 2 mohar.

In the reign of the next king (Rajendra, 1816–1847), no copper coins were issued, with silver 3⁄4, 1+1⁄2 and 3 mohar discontinued and 2 mohar introduced. Gold 1+1⁄2 mohar were also discontinued.

Surendra (1847–1881) introduced a new copper coinage in 1866, consisting of 1 dam, 1 and 2 paisa, with 1⁄2 paisa issued from 1880. The silver coinage consisted of the same denominations as his predecessor, with the gold coinage similar except for the absence of the 2 mohar. The coinage of Prithvi (1881–1911) was very similar to that of Surendra, except for the issue of silver 4 mohar and gold 1⁄64 mohar.

The copper coinage of Tribhuvan consisted of 1 paisa, with 2 and 5 paisa added in 1919. Silver coins were issued for 1 dam, 1⁄4, 1⁄2, 1, 2 and 4 mohar, with gold 1 dam, 1⁄32, 1⁄16, 1⁄8 and 1 mohar. The gold coinage continued to be issued after the introduction of the rupee until 1950.
