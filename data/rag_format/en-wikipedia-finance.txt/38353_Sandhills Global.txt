## History

The company was first established by Tom and Rhonda Peed as Peed Corp. in 1978 in Webster City, Iowa. In 1985, the headquarters were relocated to a 68-acre (280,000 m²) campus in the Highlands neighborhood of Lincoln, Nebraska, where it remains. In June 2000, Sandhills added a data center in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 2011, the company completed another data center on its Lincoln, Nebraska campus, a LEED Gold-rated building that houses the company's server farm and has three living roofs.

The Lincoln campus expanded in 2015 with an additional IT facility. In the same year, Sandhills worked with Goss International, a company that supplies presses and finishing systems, to install a new press and saddle-stitcher to expand its printing operations. In 2017, Sandhills announced the construction of the 42,000-square-foot (3,900-m²) Cyber Center facility, which houses 240 employee workstations, a reception area and cafe space, classrooms, and other training facilities. Sandhills opened an additional office location in Sidney, Nebraska in 2017.


## Community involvement

Sandhills has supported several charitable organizations, chiefly in Nebraska, including the Food Bank of Lincoln, the YMCA of Lincoln, the Lincoln Children's Zoo, Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital, the Lincoln Community Playhouse, Junior Achievement, Habitat for Humanity, and Special Olympics.

In March 2023, Sandhills announced a $4 million gift to the Lincoln Youth Complex development project, which includes nine baseball and softball fields in Lincoln, Nebraska. In August 2023, the Lancaster County Agricultural Society approved a contract with Sandhills for naming rights to the Lancaster Event Center, which, as a result, was renamed Sandhills Global Event Center for a period of 15 years.
