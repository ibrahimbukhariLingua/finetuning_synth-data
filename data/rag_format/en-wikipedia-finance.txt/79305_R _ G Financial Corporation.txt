## Summary

RG Financial Corp's chief assets and sources of income are its commercial loans (which mainly consist of commercial real estate loans and construction loans), consumer loans (which mainly consist of auto loans, personal loans and credit card loans), and residential mortgage loans. RG Financial offers banking services through a network of 66 branches (2005) between two of its subsidiaries, the largest being RG Premier Bank in Puerto Rico and the second being RG Crown Bank in the Orlando, Tampa and St. Petersburg cities of Florida.
