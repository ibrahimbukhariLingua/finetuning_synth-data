### Apples

The apple industry is of particular importance to Washington. Because of the favorable climate of dry, warm summers and cold winters of Central Washington, the state has led the U.S. in apple production since the 1920s. Two areas in Eastern Washington – the Yakima River valley and the Wenatchee River valley – account for the vast majority of the state's apple crop. The Washington Apple Commission regulates the industry.
