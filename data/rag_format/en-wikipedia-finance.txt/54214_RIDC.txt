# RIDC



The **Regional Industrial Development Corporation of Southwestern Pennsylvania**—known colloquially as the **RIDC**—is a privately funded non-profit serving the Pittsburgh metropolitan area to focus on a regional approach to economic development primarily through managing and rehabilitating area research and business parks for modern tenants. The RIDC was formed on August 8, 1955, as a non-profit corporation after area business, corporate, government and labor leaders supported a central agency responsible for developing and coordinating efforts to create new employment and economic diversity.
As of March 2013 it is listed as the third largest commercial property manager in metropolitan Pittsburgh with 7,400,000 gross leasable square feet, behind only Oxford Development and CBRE Group while surpassing Jones Lang LaSalle.

Varied industry needs, including machinery and equipment financing assistance are serviced by the RIDC for new, small and growing business enterprises, applied research and development activities and partnership with Western Pennsylvania's academic institutions. Historically the RIDC has hosted Pittsburgh Hilton conferences with area business leaders, Chambers of Commerce and speeches from the State Secretary of Commerce. It has partnered with the Appalachian Regional Commission, Carnegie Mellon University the Heinz Endowments and the Richard King Mellon Foundation among others. It has provided board members for the Allegheny County Planning Commission for such projects as Oxford Centre.

In the early 1990s the RIDC was criticized for not being more representative with female and minority board members as well as a pattern of using urban funds and assets to market suburban developments. The criticism resulted in Pennsylvania state legislature hearings.


## History

In early 1955 Pittsburgh business, corporate, government and labor leaders supported a central agency responsible for developing and coordinating efforts to create new employment and economic diversity. The RIDC was established August 8, 1955 as a nonprofit corporation and amended its charter on February 16, 1962 to allow it to engage directly in such things as construction, purchasing, selling and financing of developments. In October, 1967 the RIDC took the first steps on being inter-county when it became the lead organization in a 9 county partnership.

Operational goals of the RIDC are to maintain a dynamic economic development portfolio through preserving, strengthening and expanding the area's employment base through retention and expansion of job opportunities, and by developing and promoting programs that assist in the creation of a more diversified economy.
