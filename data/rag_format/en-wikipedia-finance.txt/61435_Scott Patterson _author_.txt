## Books


### *The Quants*

In 2010, Patterson wrote *The Quants: How a New Breed of Math Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It*, a bestseller that was published by Crown Publishing. The book outlines computer-driven quantitative trading by following the lives of four "quants." These quants are highly educated whiz kids that created complex mathematical algorithms to exploit market inefficiencies.

Ultimately, the reliance on computer-driven trading was attributed to meltdowns such as Black Monday, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, and Great Credit Crackup. The history of quantitative trading is covered, including early quants such as Edward Thorp and how much of the early knowledge was applied from lessons learned at blackjack tables. The book also highlights interactions with people against quantitative trading including Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of *Black Swan*.


### *Dark Pools*

On June 12, 2012, Patterson released *Dark Pools: High-Speed Traders, A.I. Bandits, and the Threat to the Global Financial System*. The book expands on *The Quants* to show how the rise of algorithmic trading, artificial intelligence bots, and high-frequency trading have rigged the current stock market. Patterson also discusses how governmental agencies, like the SEC, cannot keep up with the rapid evolution of technology.

These new innovations show no sign of slowing, and Patterson describes AI Bots, Dark Pools, and HFT as the future of trading.

*The Globe and Mail* described *Dark Pools* as "the best book going on the issue."
