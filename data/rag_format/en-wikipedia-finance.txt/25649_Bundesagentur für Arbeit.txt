# Bundesagentur für Arbeit



The **Bundesagentur für Arbeit** (BA for short, A4A or Arbeitsagentur) ('**Federal Employment Agency'**) is a German federal agency in the area of responsibility of the Federal Ministry for Labour and Social Affairs and has its headquarters in Nuremberg. Its current director is Andrea Nahles.

The BA manages job centres across Germany and administers unemployment benefits. The agency is further divided into *Arbeitsagentur* and *Jobcenter*.


## Organization

The BA provides services for the labor market as a federal agency, in particular job placement, job advice and job promotion, and as the administrative body of the German unemployment insurance, regulates financial wage replacement benefits, e.g. unemployment benefit. Since the BA is a federal corporation under public law with self-administration, it is subject to legal supervision by the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Section 393 Para. 1 SGB III).

In a few areas, the ministry also has the right to issue instructions and carries out technical supervision, e.g. in the case of unemployment statistics (Section 283 Para. 2 SGB III) and the employment of foreigners and people with immigrant background (Section 288 Para. 2 SGB III).

As special departments of the Federal Employment Agency, the so-called family allowance offices are responsible for implementing the tax-based family benefit compensation (e.g. child benefit) and for calculating and paying the child supplement in accordance with Section 6a of the BKGG.

With around 113,000 (as of 2023) employees (of which 42,900 work in the joint facilities - Job Center - and 5,200 in the family allowance office), the Federal Employment Agency is one of the largest authorities in Germany and one of the largest employers in the federal government. A separate collective agreement applies to the employees.

Their balance is expected to be 1.7 billion euros in 2023.

The BA's offices at regional level are called regional directorates, and at local level they are called employment agencies.
