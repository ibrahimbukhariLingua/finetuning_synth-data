## History


### Beginning

Central Group opened the Central Superstore at the Wong Sawang intersection in 1993 as a Central Department Store subsidiary. It began selling groceries from Central Supermarket and private label clothing from Central Department Store and Central Trading, under the self-service store concept.

The Big C brand was first launched on 15 January 1994, the name being an abbreviation of "Big Central". The name has since been modified to have a different meaning. That of 'Big' meaning 'a large area with various services and facilities for customers and also covers a wide variety of products that Big C selects to sell to meet all customers' needs'; whilst the 'C' means customers who have always supported Big C well'.

The first Big C store was opened on Chaengwattana Road in Bangkok.


### 1990s

Save One Rangsit was rebranded as the Big C Supercenter in 1995, and was the chain's first store outside Bangkok. The same year, Central Superstore Company Limited changed its name to Big C Supercenter Public Company Limited, and was listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) (SET: BIGC) with S.K. Garment PLC holding a majority stake.

Big C launched the single floor store concept at Bangphlee in 1996, integrating a super center 12,000 m² floor space and a layout and decor to facilitate shopping. The efficient design contributed to lower operating costs.


### Merger with Groupe Casino

After the Asian financial crisis of 1997, Big C Supercenter PCL formed a business alliance with France-based Groupe Casino, known for its Géant stores. Groupe Casino bought 530 million shares of a capital increase in 1999, making them the largest shareholder after the company's recapitalization. After securing the controlling stake in Big C, Groupe Casino sold Big C's garment business in order to concentrate only on retail activity to strengthen the efficiency of the operation.


### 2000s

Big C extended its business hours from 08:00 to midnight daily and launched the Big C website in 2000. Two years later, Big C launched a hard-discount supermarket chain, "Leader Price by Big C", an affiliate store similar to the Leader Price brand of Groupe Casino. In the same year, Big C launched its first credit card, "Big C Credit Card", and "Big C Hire-Purchase". Big C Foundation (Thai: มูลนิธิบิ๊กซี) was also launched in 2002, with its main objectives including providing necessary assistance and support for children in terms of education, and offering opportunities for education to those suffering as a result of social abuses or the drug trade.

Big C developed and expanded the "Compact Store" concept in 2005. Compact Stores each require an investment of between 300 and 400 million baht, and have an average retail space of 5,000-6,000 square metres, whereas Big C's standard stores have retail space of about 10,000 square metres and require an investment of between 600 and 700 million baht. In May 2005, the "Big C Shopper Card" was launched, which was a hire-purchase card.

In 2006, Leader Price by Big C was rebranded as "Mini Big C" (Thai: มินิบิ๊กซี), a proximity store format offering 24-hour service. Big C launched another new brand store format in July 2010 called "Big C Junior" (Thai: บิ๊กซี จูเนียร์), which is sized midway between a compact store and a supermarket.


### Global branding

The "Big C" brand was used for the first time outside Thailand at the end of 2003, with the rebranding of three Cora hypermarkets in Vietnam. The stores were owned by Vindemia, a Groupe Bourbon company in Réunion. Casino took control of Vindemia, and the Big C Supercenter banner is used for these stores.

In 2010, Big C announced that it would open its first store in Laos, inside The New Taladsao Shopping Mall in Vientiane, in late 2012.


### Carrefour acquisition

In November 2010, Big C won a bid to buy the 42 Carrefour branches in Thailand for €868 million (35.4 billion baht). After the acquisition, Groupe Casino, whose Thai subsidiary is Big C Supercenter PCL, owned 111 hypermarkets versus Tesco's 87. However, if other retail formats are included, Tesco is larger with some 704 stores nationwide.

Big C and Carrefour branches in Thailand had their first co-promotion in January 2011, before Carrefour Thailand stores were rebranded as Big C. In March 2011, Carrefour Suwintawong was the first Carrefour store to be rebranded as a Big C.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 2013, Big C main competitor, Lotus's, was ordered by the Civil Court of Thailand to pay ฿4 million to Big C following from a campaign in 2011 by Ek-chai Distribution Centre to use Carrefour coupons. Carrefour was at that time the local operator of Lotus's hypermarkets, but was later taken over by Big C which caused the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, Big C claimed damages of ฿416 million.


### Ownership under Thai Charoen Corporation

Groupe Casino SA agreed in February 2016 to sell its stake in Thai hypermarket operator Big C for €3.1 billion (US$3.46 billion) to Thai billionaire, Mr Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi. His holding company, TCC Group, announced that it would acquire Casino's 58.6% stake in Big C Thailand for 252.88 baht a share (US$7.10), valuing Big C close to US$5.86 billion at the time of sale. The sale allowed Casino to reduce its debt level by €3.3 billion. The retailer launched a €4 billion deleveraging plan in 2016 which included selling its stake in Big C as well as Vietnam retail assets. Big C is now operated and managed under Berli Jucker Public Company Limited, part of TCC Group.

On 9 May 2017, a Big C supermarket in Pattani was the subject of a terrorist attack which injured around 80 people. The attack was most likely perpetrated by local Muslim residents, although Lieutenant General Piyawat Nakwanich said that it was most likely a reaction against the presence of big businesses in the area.

In January 2020, CEO Aswin Techajareonvikul acknowledged the company's intent to acquire the operations of Tesco Lotus in Thailand and Malaysia. TCC Group (the parent company of Big C) submitted a bid, however, following financial troubles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, did not acquire the company. The sale of Tesco Lotus to the Charoen Pokphand (CP Group) was approved in November 2020 for US$10.6 billion, and was later rebranded as Lotus's.

In 2023, Big C took over 24 AbouThai stores in Hong Kong with plans to rebrand them as Big C. In August, the CEO announced plans for Big C to be dual listed on the Stock Exchanges of Thailand and Hong Kong during the fourth quarter. On 29 August, Big C postponed its return to the Stock Exchange of Thailand due to market conditions caused by the political climate of deadlock following the 2023 elections.
