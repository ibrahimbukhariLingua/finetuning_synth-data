### Fiat Industrial

**Fiat Industrial S.p.A.** was an Italian company into which Fiat S.p.A. (parent company of Fiat Group) demerged most of its activities not directly related to automobiles at the start of 2011. Fiat Industrial served as a holding company for the activities of truck manufacturer Iveco; an 89.3% stake in the agricultural and construction equipment producer CNH Global; and FPT Industrial, which consists of the industrial and marine activities formerly part of Fiat Powertrain Technologies. The company's Chairman was Sergio Marchionne, who also served as CEO of Fiat S.p.A. and Chairman/CEO of Chrysler Group LLC, now merged as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

On 1 January 2011, each existing share of Fiat S.p.A. was converted into one Fiat share and one Fiat Industrial share. This resulted in Exor (the holding company controlled by the Agnelli family), the largest shareholder of Fiat with a stake of around 30%, holding an equivalent stake in Fiat Industrial. Exor has however raised the possibility of the future sale of some of its stake.

In September 2011, the company entered the DJSI World and Europe indexes as leader in the Industrial Engineering sector.

On 29 September 2013, CNH Global N.V. and Fiat Industrial S.p.A. were merged into CNH Industrial N.V., a company incorporated in the Netherlands.
