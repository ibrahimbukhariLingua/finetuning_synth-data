## History

The building opened for business in 1972. The property was originally named **Winters Bank Tower** and served as the headquarters for Winters Bank. After Bank One, which was headquartered in Columbus, acquired Winters Bank, the building owner, Virginia Kettering, the daughter-in-law of inventor Charles F. Kettering, changed the name to Kettering Tower.

In 2005, a New York investment firm, Kettering Tower Partners LLC, bought the Kettering Tower for $21.9 million, or $45.63 per square foot. The Kettering Tower owner defaulted on the mortgage and the property was sold to Bank of America for $10.8 million at a Montgomery County Sheriff's Auction in 2011. In 2012, Albert Macanian of Dunkirk Realty, paid only $6.4 million for the property. In 2019 it was sold for 13 million to Stratacache, which makes digital signs and monitors for restaurants and retail as well virtual and augmented reality software for retail, and which intends to make the building its new headquarters.

The tower was later rebranded as Stratacache Tower.


## Restaurants and amenities

Located in the tower was the Dayton Club, formerly the Dayton Racquet Club, which offered a fitness center and business-conducive dining and banquet facilities, but which permanently closed in 2020. On the ground floor is an optometrist and the restaurant Carmen's Deli. For many years, a large Chase Bank branch was on the second floor of the tower, but ceased operations in December 2020. In June 2021, the law firm Taft Dayton signed a deal for a 15-year lease at Stratacache Tower, with plans to renovate the building's 16th and 17th floors to increase its office space, as well as opening a 3,900 foot Taft Center on the building's first floor, intended for use for meetings, conferences and events, serving as a gathering space for the local community.
