### McKinsey & Company

Ubiñas spent eighteen years at McKinsey & Company as a Senior Partner in the areas of telecommunications, technology and media. He helped found the Media Practice at McKinsey, where he led the Practice on the West Coast; his work centered on the introduction and development of the underlying capabilities and applications of internet technologies, both wired and wireless.


### Ford Foundation

Ubiñas served as president of the Ford Foundation from January 2008 through 2013. During his tenure as president, Ubiñas significantly restructured the organization. The restructuring effort focused the foundation's number of program areas from over 200 to 35, and defined eight major issues, including access to education, economic opportunity and human rights, as its core objectives. Ubiñas increased the Ford Foundation's focus on social justice issues. He also spearheaded reinvestment of over 80% of the Foundation's endowment, moving its endowment performance from bottom quartile to top quartile performance among endowments over $3 billion, renovated the network of international offices and modernized the Foundation's systems. During his tenure operating costs fell 33%. Most importantly, Ubinas focused the Foundation's programs on Social Justice issues.

Restructuring during the 2008/9 financial crisis was not without controversy, since, a few months after announcing $22 million in budget cutbacks in spring 2009, Ford announced the closure of field offices in Vietnam and Russia and offered voluntary severance packages to some New York staff to trim an additional $14 million from the budget. All savings were shifted to the grantee budget, to help social justice organizations in the United States and abroad survive the financial crisis.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
