Euroland (store)


# Euroland (store)



**Euroland** was a Dutch variety store chain.


## History

In 1997, the first *2.50 Shop* opened its doors, selling everything for ƒ2.50. In 2001, the similar shop called Knaakland ("knaak" was a ƒ2.50 coin) was bought by the 2.50 Shop chain. Both shops kept their original name until the introduction of the euro, less than a year later. Both shops were rebranded to Euroland, using a logo similar to that of Knaakland, and initially selling everything for a euro.

As the assortment expanded, the initial €1-only policy was dropped, and other, more expensive goods appeared. Later on however, everything displayed on the side walls was on sale for €1 with more expensive goods occupying the middle of the store. This partitioning was intended to avoid confusion.

The chain went bankrupt in 2017.
