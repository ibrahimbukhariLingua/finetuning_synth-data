# Otto Petschek



**Otto Petschek** (17 October 1882 – 2 July 1934) was a European industrialist known for building the Petschek Villa in Prague.


## Early life

He was the eldest of four sons of Isidor Petschek and Camilla (née Robitschek) Petschek, who were German speaking Jews. His younger brothers were Paul (1886–1946), Friedrich (1890–1940) and Hans (1895–1968), who later served as president of the family's investment firm, United Continental Corporation.

Among his family were uncles Julius Petschek and Ignaz Petschek, all of whom were originally from Kolín. Among his first cousins was Frank C. Petschek, a son of his uncle Ignaz.


## Career

The Petschek family founded various international mining and chemical enterprises in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). Their concern controlled also 30% of the German and, in total, almost 50% of the European brown coal mining industry in the years after World War I. In 1920, his uncle Julius founded the Petschek Brothers Bank (Bankhaus Petschek & Co.). Between 1923 and 1929, the family built Petschek Palace. His cousin Walter (Julius' son) and Otto's brother Hans Petschek ran the company until 1938 when they moved to New York as a consequence of the Munich Agreement.

After the death of his uncle, Ignatz Petschek, Otto was considered the head of the Petschek family.
