**The First Generation Company of the Wholesale Electricity Market** (OGK-1) was a large Russian company formed by the merger of six electricity generation companies.


## History

The company was established in 2005 by merging six power plants into one company. Before 1 July 2008, about 92% of the company's shares was owned by RAO UES, Russian state-controlled energy holding company.
