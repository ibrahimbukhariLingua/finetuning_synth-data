Property Is No Longer a Theft


# Property Is No Longer a Theft



***Property Is No Longer a Theft*** (Italian: ***La proprietà non è più un furto***) is a 1973 Italian-French comedy drama film directed by Elio Petri.


## Plot

Total, a young bank cashier, is allergic to money and feels only contempt for his customers who in his eyes built their wealth on criminal or corrupt activities. After witnessing an armed robbery in his bank, he resigns from his job and turns to theft. He stalks a former client, butcher Macellaio, who for him represents the evils of capitalism, and robs him of his valuables: first Macellaio's butcher knife and hat, then his jewellery, money, car and even his mistress Anita. When Macellaio identifies his pursuer, he tries to pay Total off, but the latter resists and teams up with professional thief Albertone instead. Total continues on his path, the spoliation of other people's property, until he is stopped by Macellaio who kills him in an elevator.
