Beyond Zero Emissions


# Beyond Zero Emissions



**Beyond Zero Emissions** (BZE) is an Australia-based, internationally recognised climate change solutions think-tank. The organization produces independent economic and public policy research on the transition of advanced economies to a zero emissions model. Beyond Zero Emission's stated research aims are to provide detailed pathways for a rapid transition in each major sector of Australia's economy. The organisation is funded by donations from individuals and charitable trusts including the Lord Mayor's Charitable Foundation and the Hamer Family Fund.


## Research

BZE's public research portfolio demonstrates viable pathways for varied sectors of the Australian economy to transition to renewable resources, and provides public policy guidelines to promote this transition. The substantiative theme of the research is that policy changes, including grants and levies, can be used to encourage the transformation of Australia's aging non-renewable power generation and transport systems into compliance with international agreements. Much of this research shows that there are significant economic benefits to the transition to zero emissions technology, alongside the mitigation of human impact on the environment. The series ofZero Carbon Australia plans cover renewable energy and electricity; energy efficient buildings; sustainable transport; agriculture, farming and land use; and the manufacturing industry.


### Million Jobs Plan

BZE launched its Million Jobs Plan in June 2020, in response to the global Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis which followed. The framework for creating 1.8 million jobs was backed by corporate heavyweights Atlassian co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes, First State Super CEO, Deanne Stewart, and long-serving corporate director Kevin McCann AO. Christiana Figueres, one of the UN architects of the Paris Agreement, joined BZE's panel discussion for the launch of the Million Jobs Plan from Costa Rica, where a blackout meant that Figueres was only able to continue her involvement due to a home battery system powered by solar.

This plan, billed to deliver "deliver one million new, good, secure, well-paying Australian jobs" was the first stage in a campaign to help rebuild the Australian economy from the COVID-19 recession. The report identified seven key sectors across the economy for strategic investment over the next five years to maximise impact: Energy, Building, Manufacturing, Transport, Recycling, Land Use and Training, with a focus on counter-urbanisation. Jobs will be distributed around Australia, including in cities and regions already under pressure from the closure of traditional heavy industry and manufacturing, historical droughts and fires, and high unemployment.


### Zero Carbon Communities

Zero Carbon Communities is an ongoing initiative of Beyond Zero Emissions designed to support local communities to reduce emissions and thrive. The program provides support and resources to empower local communities. Together with Ironbark Sustainability, BZE has developed the Snapshot community climate tool, which provides nationally consistent, community-wide greenhouse gas profiles for every local government area in Australia.

In 2020, Zero Carbon Communities partnered with ABC's series, *Fight for Planet A: Our Climate Challenge*, and was featured in their Community Solutions Plan. The ABC's three part series explores how humans can all reduce their individual and collective carbon emissions. It sought to empower and motivate Australians to take action on climate change.


### Renewable Energy Superpower

In 2015, BZE published the Renewable Energy Superpower report, proposing that nations with abundant renewable energy resources, like Australia, can be the energy superpowers of the renewable energy era. The report showed that if Australia made the most of its renewable resources, it could be the natural home for energy intensive industry, given the ever-decreasing cost of renewable technologies.

The term ‘renewable energy superpower' was used for the first time in BZE's report, which was launched by Prof Ross Garnaut, and has passed into common use.


## Activities

In addition to its collaborative research and technical support programs, the group gives webinars and presentations nationally, and runs a public discussion group on climate science and global warming solutions.

BZE takes part in many local events and conferences around Australia.

In 2016, BZE became a signatory to the campaign for a Declaration of a Climate Emergency by the Australian Parliament. In the lead up to the UN COP22 at Marrakech, Morocco, BZE officially became a partner in the Global 100% Renewable Energy Campaign.


## Funding

BZE is independently funded by donations, mostly from philanthropic trusts and individuals, as well as grants and commissioned research and projects from local and state government organisations.

BZE does not accept donations or commissioned work from political parties.
