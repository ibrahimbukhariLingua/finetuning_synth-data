## History

Established in 1871 in the then-vibrant industrial city of Rouen, it is the second business school to be created in France.

Groupe ESC Rouen was formed in 1996, gathering together four independent schools, all managed and financed mainly by the Rouen Chamber of Commerce and Industry. These schools are ESC Rouen, the leading school of the group, IFI, ISPP and ECAL - each school having a distinctive mission and student base.

ESC Rouen is a founding member of the Chapitre des Ecoles du Management de la Conférence des Grandes Ecoles (Chapter of Management Schools belonging to the Conférence des Grandes Ecoles). The school is also a member of EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) and AACSB (International Association for Management Education).

ESC Rouen received EQUIS accreditation from the European Foundation for Management Development for a second time in May 2005. Later, the school has received AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) and AMBA (Association of Masters of Business Administration) accreditations.
