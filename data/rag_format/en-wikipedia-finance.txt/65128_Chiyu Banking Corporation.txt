## History

It was founded by Tan Kah Kee on 15 July 1947, and it has 23 branches in Hong Kong and focuses on serving the community of Fujianese people in Hong Kong.

Chiyu was explicitly created by Chen to create a sustainable business with profits to be devoted to education in Xiamen and the rest of Fujian province in China. Since its founding, it has spent more than HK$1 billion in education in the province, primarily through funding Jimei University and its related schools.


## Ownership

On 27 March 2017, Bank of China (Hong Kong) disposed of all of its 70.49% of interests in Chiyu., selling most of it to Xiamen International Investment Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Xiamen International Bank Co. Ltd, and part of it (6.18% of Chiyu) to the Committee of Jimei Schools.
