## Activities and history

The company owns the La Platosa mine, one of Mexico's most silver rich mines. The mine operates at Durango on land owned by the Ejido La Sierrita community. The company was accused of failing to build a water treatment plant by the Ejido La Sierrita community. The community submitted two complaints to the Government of Canada including one to the Extractive Sector CSR Counsellor. In 2022, the company announced plans to close the La Platsoa mine, in the third quarter of the year, citing disputes with the worker's union and global metal prices.

In 2023, the company spent $50 million to purchase the La Negra silver mine in Querétaro, Mexico. The mine was previously owned by Dalu S.à r. l.
