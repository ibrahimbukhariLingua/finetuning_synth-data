## History

Kulim (Malaysia) Berhad traces its history back to 1933 when Kulim Rubber Plantations Ltd was incorporated in United Kingdom. Kulim was
later incorporated as a public limited company and was listed on Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (now known as the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad) in 1975. In 1976, Johor Corporation became the major shareholder of Kulim. Over the years, Kulim has grown to become a diversified plantation company and continues to strengthen its position by securing new hectarages while developing and strengthening its intrapreneur ventures. At the end of 2013, Kulim once again made its way into Indonesia with acquisition of 74% equity in PT Wisesa Inspirasi Nusantara, a plantation holding company in Indonesia, holding rights over 40,645 hectares of potential oil palm land in Central Kalimantan. With the completion of this strategic acquisition, as at the time of writing, the Kulim Group’s direct and indirect landholding stands at over 91,000 hectares (excluding NBPOL which was held for sale as at 31 December 2014), spread across Malaysia and Indonesia. After having footholds in O&G related businesses in Malaysia, Kulim had on 10 December 2014, entered into a Conditional Subscription and Shares Purchase.

Agreement with the existing shareholders of PT Citra Sarana Energi (“PT CSE”) for acquisition of 60% equity interest in the Company. This will enable Kulim to expand its involvement in the O&G sector particularly in Indonesia, moving up the value chain into the upstream activities - exploration and
production.
