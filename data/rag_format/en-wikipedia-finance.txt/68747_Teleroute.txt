## History

Teleroute is an online freight and vehicle exchange and has been active in France and Europe since 1985. With the roll-out of the Minitel technology (3614 Lamy), Teleroute expanded its range of services to include computer-based services and later also a web-based platform.

In 2005, WKTS took over the Nolis freight exchange, which was followed by the merger of the two freight exchanges in 2012. In the early 2010s, the Group decided to significantly expand its range of services in the field of transportation management system (TMS) through the integration of the software solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ Transwide (Charger TMS).

On 30 June 2017, Wolters Kluwer Transport Services was officially taken over by Castik Capital with the aim of creating a leading portfolio of companies in the TMS sector. Since 1 October 2017, WKTS has been operating officially under the name of Alpega.
