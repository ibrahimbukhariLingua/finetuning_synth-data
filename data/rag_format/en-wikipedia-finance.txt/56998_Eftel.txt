## History

**1999**
Datafast commenced as a trunked radio network operator in Victoria. From 1999 to 2001, it developed a 34 Mbit/s ATM backbone network in western Victoria. Ultimately the network extended to Mount Gambier in South Australia, with a hub in Melbourne and links to other state capitals.

**2000**
Eftel started as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) based in Perth, Western Australia.

**2001**
Datafast acquired a VoIP (Voice over Internet Provider) telecommunications company, and VivaNET, a wholesale only ISP.

**2002**
Datafast merged with Eftel, an ISP and broadband telecommunications carrier. The merger doubled the size of the company, providing significant economies of scale, and extended broadband operations into four states.

**2003**
Through consolidation and other initiatives, Datafast significantly reduced its networking costs, established a Layer-2 ADSL service, and extended the network to South Australia and the Northern Territory.
These initiatives helped the company to take advantage of two current trends: industry consolidation and the take-up of broadband Internet access.
In late 2003, Datafast acquired ISPs KeyPoint, EZ Web, and Impaq. These purchases raised the size of the customer base to 85,000 and extended broadband coverage to Tasmania, completing the national roll-out.

**2004**
In January 2004, Datafast acquired NSW ISP Planet Netcom, adding a further 15,000 accounts and bringing the total customer base to over 100,000, making the company one of Australia's 10 largest ISPs.
In June 2004, Datafast acquired Bunbury based ISP OzzieNet, and in October Datafast acquired Affinity, a Melbourne-based ISP and its umbrella of brands, taking the total number of active accounts on the Datafast network to 120,000.

**2005**
Acquired ViaNetAIP and MyAccess. Launched Speak voice product, packaged retail product range and Broadband over PowerLines (BPL). Datafast Telecommunications Ltd changes name to Eftel Limited.

**2006**
Acquired aaNet, a specialist broadband provider. Launched Speak voice product, packaged retail product range and Broadband over PowerLines (BPL). Datafast Telecommunications Ltd changes name to Eftel Limited.

**2007**
Eftel became the first company in Australia to announce a VDSL2 rollout. The technology will enable theoretical speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s, about 4 times faster than ADSL2+. However, as of October 2009, the VDSL2 rollout is still at the "expressions of interest" stage with no services in active operation; the aaNet VDSL2 EOI page can be seen here. http://www.aanet.com.au/vdsl\_news

**2011**
Eftel completed a merger with ClubTelco a premium consumer focused telecommunications company that rewards its members with a range of benefits. This merger has seen the company double in size.

In August 2011, Eftel acquired wholesale telecommunications service provider Platform Networks Pty Ltd. Platform Networks is a Sydney-based growing wholesale aggregator.
