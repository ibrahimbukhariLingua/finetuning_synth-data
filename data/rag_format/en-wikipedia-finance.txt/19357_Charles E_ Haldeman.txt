## Biography

He was born to Betty Jane and Charles Edgar Haldeman, Sr. on October 29, 1948, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated summa cum laude from Dartmouth College in economics in 1970. In 1974, he received both a J.D. degree cum laude from Harvard Law School and an M.B.A. degree with high distinction from Harvard Business School, where he was a Baker Scholar. He is also a CFA charter holder. In 2004, he was elected to serve as a charter trustee on the board of trustees at Dartmouth.

Haldeman was a managing partner and director at the investment firm Cooke and Bieler Inc. from 1974 to 1998, President and COO of United Asset Management Corporation from 1998 to 2000, and CEO of Delaware Investments from 2000 to 2002. He then joined Putnam Investments as co-lead of the investment division. In the wake of the Mutual fund scandal of 2003, he was appointed President and CEO of Putnam and has since led the company forward in reorganization, compliance, and enhanced disclosure. Having stabilized the business, Haldeman led an initiative to sell the company. In January 2007, Putnam Investments was sold to Great-West Lifeco for 3.9 billion dollars.

In 2009 Haldeman joined Freddie Mac as its chief executive. In July 2012 he was appointed to the McGraw-Hill's board of directors.
