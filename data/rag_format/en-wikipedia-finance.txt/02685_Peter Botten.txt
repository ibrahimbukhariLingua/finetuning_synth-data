The expansion included the company's entry into liquefied natural gas production in a project which commenced production in 2014, involving a consortium of companies including ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies.

He has served as the chairman of the Papua New Guinea Chamber of Mines and Petroleum, as a director of the Australia-PNG Business Council, the World Economic Forum's Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, and chairman of the Business Council of Papua New Guinea.
At the request of the Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, Botton took on the role as chairman of the board of Tari hospital.

Botten has also served as a director of several other companies, including the Business Council of Australia, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association. Since 2016, he has been a non-executive director of AGL Energy, becoming chairman in 2021 and 2022. Following this departure, he became chairman of Conrad Asia Energy and in 2024, he took on the role of chairman of the solar developer Vast Renewables.

In 2015, the Harvard Business Review and Australian Financial Review included him as one of two Australians among the world's 100 top-performing CEOs.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 2019 Australia Day Honours "for eminent service to Australia-Papua New Guinea relations, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and to social and economic initiatives".
