## History

The company was founded in 1809 by Robert Tullis as R Tullis & Co. The company Coated Papers moved to Bollington in 1875. The company name changed to Tullis, Russell & Company Ltd on 21 May 1906. Sir David Russell was a former managing director. The company's brand of paper was called *Ivorex*, and *Ivorindex* for card. The company joined the Employers' Federation of Paper and Board Makers in 1947. Tullis Russell bought Coated Papers in 1989.

In 1996 a management buyout purchased 70 per cent of the shares which are held today in an Employee Trust. The outstanding 30 per cent is held in the Russell Trust. In 2011 Tullis Russell received the Txemi Cantera International Social Economy Prize from ASLE for its commitment to the principles of the Social Economy.
