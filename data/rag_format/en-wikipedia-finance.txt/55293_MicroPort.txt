# MicroPort



**MicroPort** is a multinational medical technology developer and manufacturer that is primarily headquartered in Shanghai, China. It mainly designs and produces medical devices for a range of fields including cardiology, interventional radiology, orthopedics, electrophysiology, and surgical management. MicroPort is considered one of the global Medtech Big 100 and has been consistently known as the leading spender in research and development by percentage of revenue.


## History

MicroPort was founded in 1998 by Zhaohua Chang, who currently serves as CEO, chairman, and Director. The company rose to prominence from the early success of its coronary stent line due its focus on serving the needs of the Chinese device market. It is now one of the top global manufacturers of cardiac interventional devices. Notably, it produces the world's first and only commercially available targeted drug eluting stent system, which uses a significantly reduced amount of drug than traditional drug eluting stents while maintaining effectiveness. As of early 2018, MicroPort is one of few medical device companies still developing a commercial coronary bioresorbable stent with ongoing clinical trials.

Beginning in the 2010s, MicroPort has rapidly expanded around the world via international acquisitions to other medical device industries, including orthopedics and cardiac rhythm management. These acquisitions have been followed up with substantial local investment, including a US$398 Million investment in 2019 to develop pacemakers and defibrillators in France.

In 2022, MicroPort established its US headquarters in Irvine, California with facilities that include a manufacturing base and innovation center. As of 2022, its principal business is valued at over US$6.5 Billion.


## Acquisitions

In 2014, MicroPort expanded operations in the United States by acquiring Wright Medical's OrthoRecon business to become the 6th largest international producer of orthopedic devices at the time. MicroPort's orthopedic business is based in Arlington, Tennessee and in 2018 has expanded its business into India.

In 2018, MicroPort and LivaNova closed the sale of LivaNova's cardiac rhythm management business for $190M.

In 2018, MicroPort purchased Lombard Medical, a UK-based endovascular device company, from bankruptcy after it defaulted on loans in early 2018.

In 2021, MicroPort purchased Hemovent GmbH, a German-based manufacturer of extracorporeal life support systems.
