Alicia Koplowitz


# Alicia Koplowitz



**Alicia Koplowitz y Romero de Juseu** (born 12 September 1954) is a Spanish billionaire business magnate and former noblewoman who held the title of Marchioness of Bellavista [es] until her distant cousin María Elena de Cárdenas gained the title after the Supreme Court of Spain ruled that Cárdenas had more rights to the title than Koplowitz.

When her father died, she and her sister inherited Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, S.A. (CYCSA), a company founded by her father. She then sold her part of the company to her sister and created one of the largest family offices in Europe, called Omega Capital.


## Early life and education

Koplowitz was born in Madrid in 1954, the second and youngest daughter (after Esther, born in 1953) of Ernesto Koplowitz Sternberg, a Jewish businessman from Upper Silesia who settled down in Spain to escape the increasing German Nazi persecution in the early-1930s, and Esther Romero de Juseu y Armenteros, a Spanish aristocrat. (Alicia and Esther inherited their titles from their mother. Alicia is *Marquesa de Bellavista* and *Marquesa del Real Socorro* while Esther was *Marquesa de Casa Peñalver*, a title now inherited by one of her daughters.) Her parents married in 1950 in a Catholic ceremony.

Her father first worked for the German electronics company AEG and then in 1952, borrowing funds from a German friend, purchased the construction company Construcciones y Reparaciones S. A. which he renamed Construcciones y Contratas S. A. (CYCSA). When Spain experienced a construction boom in the early 1960s, the company flourished.

Koplowitz attended the Lycée Français and University Complutense of Madrid.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Career

In 1962, her father died in a horse-riding accident and her mother enlisted Ramón Areces, a close friend of her father and the president of El Corte Inglés S.A., the largest department store chain in Europe, to run CYCSA for her and her daughters' benefit. In 1968, Alicia's mother died of cancer.

In 1969, Koplowitz's sister Esther married Alberto Alcocer and six months later, Koplowitz married Alberto Alcocer's cousin Alberto Cortina, the son of Pedro Cortina Mauri, a foreign minister during the Franco period. The sisters gave up their board seats to their husbands and the "Albertos", as they were known, made the firm grow from 1973 onwards and diversified acquiring real estate, Banco Zaragozano, and 47 percent of the Catalan construction firm Fomento de Obras y Construcciones SA (FOCSA).

In 1990, Koplowitz divorced Alberto Cortina after he was photographed by paparazzi in 1989 with another woman (Marta Chávarri, then wife of Fernando Falcó, *marqués de Cubas*, who Esther would later marry in 2003). At the same time, Esther also found that her husband was having an affair and divorced six months later. In 1990, the sisters returned to the board of CYCSA, filling the seats vacated by their husbands. Their husbands received ownership of the Banco Zaragozano as part of the divorce settlement.

In 1992, CYCSA merged with Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, S. A. (FOCSA) forming the largest construction company in Spain. The company was renamed Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas S.A. (FCC). In 1998, Koplowitz sold her 28.26% stake in FCC to her sister Esther for 871 million euro. When Alicia left FCC in 1998, FCC was the largest construction and services company in Spain. In 2012, FCC had dropped to fifth largest in Spain while its competitor Grupo ACS (with the sisters' ex-husbands Alberto Cortina and Alberto Alcocer among its largest shareholders) is now the largest construction and services company in the world.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
