Comptroller of Maryland


# Comptroller of Maryland



The **comptroller of Maryland** is a constitutional officer of the U.S. state of Maryland. Thirty-four individuals have held the office of comptroller since 1851, when the office was created. The incumbent is Brooke Lierman, a Democrat.


## Election and term of office

The comptroller is elected by the citizens of Maryland to a four-year term on Election Day in November, and takes office on the third Monday of the January next succeeding. There is no limit to the number of terms a comptroller may hold. Likewise, neither the Maryland Constitution nor the Annotated Code of Maryland prescribe any qualifications for the office, such as residency, age, or even citizenship requirements.

In the event of a vacancy in the office of comptroller, the governor may appoint a successor to serve the balance of the term. The comptroller may be removed from office by the General Assembly through impeachment. However, the comptroller cannot be recalled under Maryland law.


## Powers and duties

The comptroller's office was established by the second Maryland Constitution of 1851 due to concern for potential fraud and corruption in the administration of the public treasury. Pursuant to this mandate, the comptroller effectively functions as Maryland's chief financial officer. The constitutional duties of the office begin with the broad mandate to exercise "general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the State", which includes maintaining the general ledger. To this end, the comptroller prescribes and operates the statewide accounting system, administers payroll to state employees, and prepares the state of Maryland's annual comprehensive financial report. As it concerns revenue administration, the comptroller collects taxes due the state, conducts income and sales tax audits of taxpayers for compliance with state and local laws, processes tax returns, settles delinquent tax receipts, and enforces business licensing and unclaimed property laws. It is by virtue of the Disposition of Abandoned Property Act that the comptroller's office publicizes taxpayers' forgotten bank accounts, insurance benefits and other unclaimed assets. Likewise, the comptroller (or a deputy) draws all warrants for payment of money on the state treasury and countersigns all checks drawn by the state treasurer on state deposits. The comptroller also prescribes the formalities for transfer of evidences of state debt and countersigns such papers.
