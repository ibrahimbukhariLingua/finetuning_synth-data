In 1969, he established the first hedge fund of funds.

In 1961, after visiting a Club Med vacation center in Israel, the Baron decided to settle the business debt of the company, back then on the brink of bankruptcy, and invest in its development. He owned 34% of Club Med (around 10 million francs worth of shares) which was listed in the Paris stock exchange in 1966. He acquired a major stake in the Bank of California in 1973, for $22 million, establishing it as a holding company for his investments in the United States.

At the tail end of the 1960s, Baron Edmond de Rothschild revitalized the family tradition for yacht racing, shifting the focus from motorboats to monohull sailboats. He commissioned six new Gitanas (III to VIII) designed by prominent firms of naval architects. These newfangled ships were successful in competitions such as the RORC races, and the 1965 Fastnet Race won by the Gitana IV. Being especially fond of larger racing ships, the Baron created the A Class or "Maxi" class, a racing category comprising yachts exceeding 21 m (70 ft) in length.

In 2001, his son Benjamin founded the Gitana Team of racing yachts. In 2017, the Gitana Team introduced the 32x23-meter Maxi Edmond de Rothschild (Gitana 17), the offshore racing's first maxi-multihull designed to fly in the open ocean.

He was an investor in Domaines Barons Rothschild, which owned Château Lafite Rothschild and Chateau Rieussec, and also developed the vineyards of Peyre-Lebade and Malmaison.

In the 1950s, Edmond de Rothschild donated the family's property to the new Israeli State.
