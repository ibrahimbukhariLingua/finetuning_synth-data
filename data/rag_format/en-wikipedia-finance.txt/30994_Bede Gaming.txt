## History

Bede Gaming Ltd was founded in 2011 by Joseph Saumarez Smith, Dan Smyth and Michael Brady, online gambling industry veterans who had previously worked with leading games suppliers such as OpenBet, Playtech and Dragonfish. Their frustration at working with legacy gambling platforms that did not allow simple changes to the customer facing front end led them to develop their own platform.

In May 2017, Bede Gaming joined a limited number of providers in the gambling industry to receive ISO 27001 certification from the International Organization for Standardization deeming its omnichannel platform compliant with current information security standards.

Gauselmann Group acquired a majority stake in Bede Gaming in March 2020 for an undisclosed sum.
