## History

The basis for the creation of JSC United Instrument Corporation was the approval of the State Program of the Russian Federation "Development of the Electronic and Radioelectronic industry for 2013-2025".

On May 8, 2013, the order of the President of Russia V. V. Putin No. Pr-1056 "On the creation of a united holding company in the field of radioelectronic industry" was issued.

On April 29, 2014, the Rostec Supervisory Board approved the proposal of the corporation's management board to form the United Instrument Corporation holding, which included the Constellation and Vega concerns, the Management Systems Company and the Central Research Institute of Economics, Informatics and Management Systems.

In 2014, in accordance with the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation "On the Property Contribution of the Russian Federation to the State Corporation Rostechnologii and on Amendments to the List of strategic Enterprises" dated January 14, 2014 No.20, the State Corporation Rostechnologii (Rostec) received as a property contribution of the Russian Federation 100 percent of shares in a number of open joint-stock companies, including Vega Radio Engineering Corporation (Moscow), Sozvezdie Concern (Voronezh) and Management Systems (Moscow), which are federally owned. By the same Decree, the enterprises transferred to Rostec were excluded from the List of Strategic Enterprises and strategic joint-stock companies. The relevant changes were approved by the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation dated April 21, 2014 No.365. With the approval of the Rostec Supervisory Board, these enterprises became part of JSC United Instrument Corporation.

In 2014, UIMC delivered NKVS-27, which is a ground-based aerial communication system to the Vietnam armed forces.

In February 2017 Rostec State Corporation announced the merger of JSC Russian Electronics and JSC United Instrument Corporation. As a result of the consolidation of assets, a radioelectronic company was formed – Russia's largest manufacturer of communications equipment, automated control systems, as well as other types of high-tech military and civilian products.

In 2021 the process of combining Rostec's radioelectronic assets under a single management and the creation of a national electronics vendor under the Roselektronika brand was completed.
