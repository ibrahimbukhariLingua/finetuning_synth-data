## Production


### Development

The project was announced in August 2019. Vincent Lindon was the first actor to be announced in the cast. The working title was *Tikkoun*. The screenplay was written by Xavier Giannoli and Jean Baptiste Delafon, based on the 2018 book *D'argent et de sang* by journalist Fabrice Arfi about the 2008–2009 carbon tax fraud scandal which resulted in a major tax shortfall in France and was dubbed "the fraud of the century" by the press. *Of Money and Blood* marks the first television series for both Giannoli and Lindon.

The series was produced by Curiosa Films. The budget was €30 million ($28 million). Canal+ bought the rights to Arfi's book and financed 50% of the development costs.

The character Jérôme Attias was inspired by French businessman Arnaud Mimran and would be played by Gaspard Ulliel, who had already started filming the series and was pictured on the set in December 2021. Ulliel was on a break from shooting *Of Money and Blood* when he died from a head injury on 19 January 2022–after a skiing accident on the previous day. The production still had 84 more days left of filming and Ulliel was expected to return to the set on 24 January 2022. Filming was suspended following Ulliel's death.

The character Alain Fitoussi, portrayed by Ramzy Bedia, was inspired by Mimran's friend, Mardoché Mouly, also known as Marco Mouly.

Initially, Giannoli wanted to stop shooting the series and throw away months of work after Ulliel's death. He later changed his mind and started looking for a replacement for Ulliel. On 18 February 2022, Canal+ confirmed to France's *Le HuffPost* that actor Niels Schneider would replace Ulliel in the miniseries. Ulliel and Schneider were friends and co-stars in the films *One Nation, One King* (2018) and *Sibyl* (2019).

In an interview with French magazine *Femina* in April 2022, Schneider said he was skeptical when Giannoli offered him the role, because Ulliel's death had brought back memories of what he had experienced with the death of his brother, who also died young and violently in an accident, and it took him a long time to put his brother's death at a distance, but everything came back to him after Ulliel's death. It was meeting Giannoli that convinced him to take on the role. Schneider said Giannoli was "destroyed" and had thought about quitting the series after Ulliel's death, but that he knew how to find the right words and told Schneider that they also practice this profession "to ward off death and tragedy". Schneider asked for a week of reflection before accepting the role. His partner Virginie Efira encouraged him to accept it. Following Schneider's casting, filming resumed in April 2022. Ulliel and Schneider had the same height and the same measurements, and for that reason Schneider ended up wearing the same costumes that had been worn by Ulliel in the beginning of filming.


### Filming

Principal photography began on 16 October 2021. After a pause in January 2022 following Ulliel's death, filming resumed in April 2022 and wrapped on 22 October 2022. Filming took place in Cyprus, Paris, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, Israel, Manila and Philippines.

The series will be distributed internationally by StudioCanal. Canal+ holds distribution rights in Poland, Africa, Myanmar and Vietnam.
