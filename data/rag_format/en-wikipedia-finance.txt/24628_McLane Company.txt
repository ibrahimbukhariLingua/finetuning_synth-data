## History

In 1894, Robert McLane opened a small retail grocery store in downtown Cameron, Texas. In 1903, he expanded into wholesale trade, supplying grocery stores in neighboring towns via rail and horse-drawn wagons. During the 1920s through to the 1940s, his business grew to encompass much of the Central Texas region.

In 1966, McLane Company moved its operations to Temple, Texas, and began tailoring its warehouse operations and distribution methods to the retail market, including the growing convenience store market.

In 1976 under the leadership of Drayton McLane, Jr., the company began expanding beyond Texas. By 1990, the company had established a national presence.

In December 1990, Drayton McLane sold McLane Company to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. for 10.4 million shares of Wal-Mart stock and an undisclosed amount of cash.

McLane Company entered the foodservice business in December 2000, when it acquired certain assets from AmeriServe Food Distribution to create McLane Foodservice.

In May 2003, Berkshire Hathaway acquired McLane Company from Wal-Mart for $1.45 billion.

In 2012, McLane acquired Meadowbrook Meat Company (MBM), a foodservice distributor.
