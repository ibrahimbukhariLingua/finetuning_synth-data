## Criticism and controversies


### Support of American tariffs on Canada

In 2025, Lütke criticized the Canadian federal government for its decision to impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States after President Donald Trump enacted 25% tariffs on Canadian goods. Lütke sided with the U.S. over Canada and defended Trump's decision to put tariffs on Canada, saying, "Trump believes that Canada has not held its side of the bargain, and he set terms to prove that we still work together: get the borders under control and crack down on fentanyl dens."


### Platform content policies

Lütke has faced criticism over Shopify's platform content policies and their enforcement. The company has historically defended free speech in commerce, including hosting controversial clients like the far-right online tabloid Breitbart in 2017.
