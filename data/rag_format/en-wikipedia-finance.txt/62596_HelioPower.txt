### Energy Analytics

Energy analytics synthesizes three distinct but inter-related pieces of information: (1) How much energy and power a business uses, and when and where it’s used; (2) what a business makes, moves or stores; where it performs this work, when it performs this work, and how this work changes and scales; and, (3) what a business pays, and how it procures, energy and power. HelioPower provides energy analytics consulting services to the water/waste-water, manufacturing and distribution industries.


### Engineering, Procurement, & Construction (EPC)

HelioPower offers turnkey EPC solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ including solar PV, energy storage and facility improvement measures, and systems integration solutionsᵇᵘᶻᶻʷᵒʳᵈ including CHP and bio-mass.

### PredictEnergy Energy Analytics Software

Predict Energy is a cloud-based commercial and industrial energy analytics software platform that tracks, analyzes and predicts energy cost and energy intensity based on three dimensions:

1. Energy Intensity – energy and power by date, time and location
2. Business performance – production, distribution or processing volume by date, time and location
3. Cost structure – electric utility tariff, distributed generation, work rules and demand response impact

The PredictEnergy software platform is specifically designed to address energy intensity in the manufacturing, distribution, and water/waste-water industries.

As a result, water agencies can transfer the money they were paying the electric companies back into water projects to help their ratepayers.
