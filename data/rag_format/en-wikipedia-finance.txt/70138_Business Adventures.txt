Business Adventures


# Business Adventures



***Business Adventures*** is a 1969 collection of 12 essays written by John Brooks. The essays, all of which were previously published in *The New Yorker*, deal with financial and corporate life in the United States. In 1963 Harper & Row published *The Fate of the Edsel and Other Business Adventures*, which contains 3 of the 12 essays published in the 1969 collection.

On July 11, 2014 in an essay published in the *Wall Street Journal* and slightly later in his blog, Bill Gates proclaimed *Business Adventures*, recommended to him by Warren Buffett, as "the best business book I've ever read."

> The prose is superb: reading Brooks is a supreme pleasure. His writing turns eye-glazing topics (eg, price-fixing scandals in the electronics market) into rollicking narratives. ...
> ... he tells entertaining stories with richly drawn characters, set during heightened moments within the world of commerce. He invites the readers to draw their own conclusions about best practices. ...
> The lessons still apply ...

On July 8, 2014, Open Road Media released an e-book edition entitled *Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street* and in August 2014 offered a paperback edition. In 2014 Penguin Random House Audio released an audiobook of *Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street* narrated by Johnny Heller.
