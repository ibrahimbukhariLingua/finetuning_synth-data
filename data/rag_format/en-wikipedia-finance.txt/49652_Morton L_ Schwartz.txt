**Morton L. Schwartz** (August, 1883 - January 11, 1953) was an American banker and financier who was a member of the New York Stock Exchange and a major owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses.


## Horse racing

Morton Schwartz owned Elsmeade Farm on Russell Cave Pike near Lexington, Kentucky. Successful horses he raced included:

* Gusto, leading money earner in the United States in 1932
* Bold Venture, 1936 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes
* Enfilade, 1918 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly

On August 21, 1935, Morton Schwartz sold all his bloodstock through a Fasig-Tipton dispersal auction held at Saratoga Springs, New York. Among the yearlings sold was a filly later named Dawn Play who would turn out to be the last Champion Schwartz bred when she was voted 1937 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.

Morton Schwartz was a twin to brother Charles who won England's prestigious Grand National at Aintree Racecourse in 1926 with Jack Horner.
