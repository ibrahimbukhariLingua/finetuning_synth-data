**Mohammed Mahfoodh Al Ardhi** is an Omani businessman and former military chief. He is currently the Executive Chairman of Investcorp, Chairman of Bank Sohar, Previous Chairman of the National Bank of Oman and was both the youngest and longest serving native head of the Royal Air Force of Oman, having joined as a fighter pilot.


## Family background and early life

Al Ardhi was born in Sur, Oman, to Omani parents. His father was head of the regional customs office. Due to the demands of his father's career, Al Ardhi's family moved several times during his early life to various parts of western Oman. Eventually the family moved to Al Batana and finally to Muscat, where Al Ardhi attended secondary school.

Al Ardhi's childhood was often difficult, not just for his family but for Oman as a whole. Families often lived without running water and electricity during this period. The Dhofar Rebellion, a conflict that eventually turned out to be the longest armed conflict in the history of the Arabian Peninsula (1965–1975), Britain's last colonial war in the region, and a proxy war in the Cold War, further exacerbated Oman's problems. It wasn't uncommon for civilians to become victims of the political and military conflict. Al Ardhi's family was no exception. In 1968 and 1969, their homes in Alaswad were bombed by revolutionaries. Government facilities, including his father's office, were often attacked. His father narrowly escaped death during a bombing when he stepped away from his desk.

Shaped by the experience of his country and his family, Al Ardhi was drawn into public service as a young adult. His father played a crucial role during this phase, encouraging his son to take up internships with the government rather than attend summer camps, play sports, or travel. Al Ardhi worked briefly as an intern in the Ministry of Oil and Gas and the court of the Sultan of Oman before he joined the Royal Air Force of Oman at the age of 17.

Al Ardhi's service with the Royal Air Force included serving as chairman of the Oman–U.S. Military Commission and chairman of the Oman–Iran Military Committee.

Al Ardhi retired from the Royal Air Force with the rank of Air Vice Marshal.

Oman is a fantastic country for tourism; the geography, the people, the topography, We have all the ingredients that make it a hot destination. It is untapped still. It is stable.
