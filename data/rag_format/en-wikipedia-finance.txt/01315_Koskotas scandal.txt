Koskotas scandal


# Koskotas scandal



**Koskotas scandal** (Greek: Σκάνδαλο Κοσκωτά) was a corruption and financial scandal in 1989 Greece centered on George Koskotas, owner of the Bank of Crete and mass media magnate, implicating the highest-ranking members of the Greek government, including Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.

Koskotas was shaken by early investigations of Greek publishers on the rapid changes in the ownership of the media landscape in the mid-1980s and left Greece to the United States to avoid justice. However, he was caught by US authorities for unrelated fraud crimes on 24 November 1988. In prison, Koskotas' alleged that the missing over $200 million from his bank was embezzled with the support of several government ministers and Papandreou. In return, Koskotas supported Papandreou's socialist political party (PASOK) through his magazines and newspapers, some of which were bought with embezzled money, including conservative newspapers such as Kathimerini. The revelation attracted international attention and caused considerable political turmoil, with six ministers resigning in protest. A judicial inquiry revealed additional scandals, further deepening the public disillusionment with the populist government of Papandreou. However, Papandreou, having removed any constitutional restraints on the prime minister's position after the constitutional crisis of 1985, abused his power by introducing legislation to prevent the advancement of Koskotas investigation, which, if convicted he would go to prison for life, and changed the electoral law to prevent the opposition from coming to power. Moreover, Papandreou, during the election campaign, promised to empty the coffers of the state to his loyal supporters, and over 90,000 civil service jobs were bestowed as a means to stay in power and suppress the scandal.

Papandreou lost the June 1989 Greek parliamentary election, owing much to the Koskotas scandal, but no single political party was able to form a government by itself due to Papandreou's electoral law change. Nevertheless, this led to an unexpected collaboration between conservative New Democracy and radical-left Synaspismos political parties to form a government and decide on the indictment of Papandreou and his ministers. This collaboration was extraordinary for Greek society since they were on opposite sides in the Greek civil war, and it was marked as a healing process. However, the political polarization had reached its climax when, on the day that the Parliament initiated procedures for the indictment of Papandreou and three of his ministers, 17 November terrorist organization assassinated Pavlos Bakoyannis, a member of parliament and the architect of Papandreou's indictment. Both major political parties accused each other for the assassination. After two more parliamentary elections in less than six months, the political opposition, New Democracy, led by Constantine Mitsotakis came to power in April 1990.

Koskotas was extradited to Greece in 1991 for the trial, which lasted nine months with live broadcasts dominating the news cycles and public discourse; one of the ministers had a heart attack on live TV and died a few days later. At the end of the trial, Koskotas and Papandreou's ministers were found guilty. Papandreou was acquitted by one vote. The trial is considered one of the most significant trials of modern Greece.

The scandal marked a turning point in Papandreou's populist government, which has controlled the state apparatus since 1981. The year 1989, in which the scandals were revealed out of the Koskotas scandal, is called "dirty 89".


## Background

The Third Hellenic Republic was founded in 1974 in a turbulent period in Greece, right after a seven-year junta (1967-1974) which fell because of its poor handling of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Constantine Karamanlis returned from exile and laid the foundations for the new republic with the Constitution of 1975.

At the same period, the Greek economy, having outperformed in the previous two decades, was slowing down due to the oil crisis of the 1970s and the additional competition with the entry into the European Market.

In 1980, Karamanlis became President of Greece, leaving a power vacuum that led Papandreou to become Greece's first socialist prime minister. The elevation of Papandreou was hailed as a milestone because PASOK was the first non-communist political party and a step in renormalizing the social trauma caused by the Greek civil war (1946-1949). The cohabitation of the two men in the 1981–1985 period was successful since Papandreou governed in a more pragmatic approach compared to his radical polarizing rhetoric by reversing many of his campaign promises.

However, in 1985, Papandreou triggered constitutional crisis by suddenly declaring not to support Constantine Karamanlis for a second term as President of the Republic, and proposing constitutional amendments designed to further increase the power of his position by reducing the presidential powers that were acting as checks and balances against the powerful executive branch. The new president was elected by the Parliament in a tense and confrontational atmosphere due to constitutionally questionable procedures by Papandreou. The constitutional amendments took effect in 1986, effectively making the position of prime minister a "parliamentary autocrat."

Early in Papandreou's second administration, press reports on PASOK's corruption multiplied, with notable ones being the "Yugoslav corn scandal," the "telephone tapping scandal," and the "public utilities scandal." However, Papandreou himself was implicated in the Koskotas scandal, which overshadowed all other PASOK's scandals.


## Early investigation

George Koskotas was the owner of the Bank of Crete and, in a short amount of time, bought several newspapers, including two of the largest conservative newspapers (Kathimerini and Vradyni), radio stations, and one the top soccer teams, Olympiacos F.C. in the mid-80s. Publishers became suspicious of the rapid changes in the media landscape and started investigating where Koskotas was finding all this money. Moreover, it became apparent that Koskotas had help from the PASOK government in overcoming bureaucratic barriers. Soon, a judicial inquiry found that Koskotas embezzled large sums from the bank's clients and illegally used this money to form a mass media empire to support PASOK exclusively. The Greek court also restricted Koskotas from leaving Greece. To avoid justice, he left Greece for the United States (with an intermediary stop at Brazil) on 5 November 1988 despite being under strict surveillance by Greek security forces.


## Koskotas arrested & revelations

Koskotas was arrested on 24 November 1988 in Massachusetts for unrelated fraud crimes and was jailed in the United States. In December 1988, after the opposition and various respected former ministers called for a clean-up, Papandreou reshuffled the ministers and yielded under pressure to a parliamentary commission inquiry. Demetrios Halikias, the governor of the Bank of Greece, testified to the commission on 7 December 1988 that two senior PASOK ministers had tried to prevent an audit of the Bank of Crete. Resignations followed (Stathis Yiotas, Deputy Defence Minister, and Theodore Karatzas, Finance Under Secretary) upon the revelations during the inquiry that the members of Papandreou's government were profiteering by illegal arms sales to both sides in the Iran–Iraq War and the apartheid state of South Africa. It also revealed that for the "purchase of the century" (40 American F-16 and 40 French Mirage 2000 aircraft), the Greek state overpaid by as much as 20% above the true cost due to illegal commissions to PASOK members.

In March 1989, Time magazine published an article describing in detail the allegations that Koskotas made to US officials. Koskotas alleged that Papandreou and other PASOK high functionaries had ordered state corporations to deposit funds (over US$200 million) with the Bank of Crete, which went missing in the form of bribes and acquisition of mass media companies. Koskotas claimed that on one occasion, he had delivered to Papandreou himself US$600,000 stuffed in a Pampers Diapers box. Papandreou denied the story, accused the US of manufacturing this scandal to destroy him, and even sued Time magazine.


## Political turmoil

Koskotas's accusations gained international attention. Several months after the arrest of Koskotas, six ministers (including Costas Simitis) resigned in protest of the corruption among the most senior members of PASOK.

There were demands for a vote of no confidence against the government, which Papandreou defeated in December 1988 and another one in March 1989. Still, three members of PASOK voted against the party line, however, Papandreou responded by removing them from PASOK, including Antonis Tritsis, who was a founding member of PASOK. Papandreou attacked the judiciary independence by passing a law via emergency procedures, despite massive backlash from lawyers, judges, and clerks, to alter the judicial procedure to avoid or delay the convocation of the Athens Appeals Court, which was responsible for initiating criminal proceedings on financial scandals, like the case of Koskotas.

Political polarization reached a climax five weeks before the scheduled elections of November 1989, when the Greek parliament was about to start deliberations on whether Papandreou and three of his ministers would be indicted. On this day (26 September 1989) and hours before deliberations began, Pavlos Bakoyannis, a prominent conservative member of parliament and the architect of collaboration between the left and right wings for Papandreou's indictment, was shot by 17 November terrorist group outside his office in Athens. Both major political parties (New Democracy and PASOK) accused each other for the assassination. A few days later, Papandreou stormed out of Parliament, shouting, "I accuse my accusers", just before the parliamentary vote on his indictment.


## Catharsis

In the June 1989 elections, PASOK's electoral percentage fell to 38% from 48% in 1981, owing much to the Koskotas scandal. However, Mitsotakis' party got 43%, but it was insufficient to form a government; Papandreou's last-minute change of the electoral vote law required a party to win 50% of the vote to govern alone. Papandreou hoped that while PASOK might come second in electoral votes, it could form a government with the support of the other leftist parties, but he was rejected. Instead, New Democracy (right wing) collaborated with the Synaspismos (radical left), led by Charilaos Florakis, to form a government under Tzannis Tzannetakis; while on the opposite ideological sides (as well in the Greek Civil War), both sought a "catharsis," i.e., investigation and trial of PASOK's corruption was completed. The decision carried additional responsibility because if no charges were brought against Papandreou under the current collaboration between New Democracy and Synaspismos, no future government could do so based on the Greek constitution. The participation of Synaspismos party in the government marked the end of the militarized politics of the past since there was no reaction from the military. The collaborative government granted the first private television broadcast licenses to publishers who were critical to PASOK as a counterbalance to state media, to avoid future political exploitation from any future all-powerful prime minister.

In the elections of April 1990, Mitsotakis received sufficient (by one seat above the threshold) support to form a government, and Papandreou became the opposition leader.


## Trial

Koskotas was extradited to Greece in 1991 for the trial, and Papandreou's trial began in Athens on 11 March 1991. However, as a former prime minister, he exercised his constitutional right not to attend the trial and proclaimed that the trial was a witch-hunt. In January 1992, the Parliament-appointed tribunal of 13 judges of Supreme Special Court, having heard over 100 witnesses and investigated 50,000 pages of documents over ten months, acquitted Papandreou of the charge of instigating the loss of funds of state companies with a 7–6 vote and a bribery charge of receiving the proceeds of a crime with a vote 10–3. During the trial, the deputy of the Prime Minister, Agamemnon Koutsogeorgas, who was also accused and a close friend of Papandreou, had a stroke on live television during his sentencing and died a few days afterward. Dimitris Tsovolas, former Minister of Finance, was sentenced to two-and-a-half jail years. Koskotas was tried and sentenced to a 25-year prison term.

When Constantine Karamanlis was asked about the verdict, he commented, "In democracies, prime ministers do not go to prison. They return home." by both reaffirming the court's decision while at the same time admitting the existence of both positive and negative implications for the country. The trial was characterized as the "trial of trials" and the most critical judicial decision in modern Greek history since the Trial of the Six in 1922.
