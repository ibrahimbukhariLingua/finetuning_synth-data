Airbus Corporate Jets


# Airbus Corporate Jets



**Airbus Corporate Jets** (**ACJ**) is a business unit of Airbus which markets and completes business jet variants of the company’s airliners. Following the entry of the 737-based Boeing Business Jet into the market, Airbus introduced the A319-based Airbus Corporate Jet in 1997. Although the term Airbus Corporate Jet was initially used only for the A319CJ, it is now used for all models in a VIP configuration. As of June 2019, 213 corporate and private jets are operating; 222 aircraft have been ordered, including 128 A320 family jets.

The Airbus Corporate Jet Centre is based in Toulouse, France, and specialises in single-aisle aircraft.


## Narrow-body aircraft

The ACJ family is based on the A320 family of aircraft, beginning with the A319CJ. Today any version of the A320 is available as a corporate jet with a 180-minute ETOPS rating. Changes over the passenger versions include an increase in service ceiling to 41,000 ft (12,000 m) and the use of a variable number of removable additional fuel tanks.


### ACJ318

The ACJ318 offered a range of 4,200 nmi or 7,800 km. The smallest of the ACJ family, based on the passenger A318, was offered in passenger configurations between 14 and 18 passengers.


### ACJ319

The ACJ319 offered a range of 6,000 nmi or 11,100 km.
This model is the corporate jet version of the A319. It incorporates removable extra fuel tanks which are installed in the cargo compartment, and an increased service ceiling of 12,000 m (39,000 ft). Upon resale the aircraft can be reconfigured as a standard A319 by removing its extra tanks, thus maximizing its resale value. Certificated by both the European JAA and American FAA, the A319LR and ACJ are the only business jets approved for public transport on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2018, its unit cost was $105M.

The aircraft seats between 19 and 50 passengers but may be outfitted by the customers into any configuration. DC Aviation, UB Group, and Reliance Industries are among its users. The A319CJ competes with the Boeing BBJ1, Gulfstream G550, and Bombardier Global Express. Because of its wider fuselage diameter, it offers a roomier interior than its competitors. It is powered by the same engine types as the A320, either the CFM International CFM56-5 or the V2527.

The A319CJ was used by the *Escadron de transport, d'entrainement et de calibration* which is in charge of transportation for France's government officials, and was also ordered by the Flugbereitschaft of the Luftwaffe for the transport of German government officials. Since 2003, an ACJ is a presidential aircraft of Armenia, Brazil, Czech Republic, Italy, Malaysia, Slovakia, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and Venezuela.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### ACJ320

The ACJ320 offered a range of 4,300 nmi or 7,800 km.
The A320 Prestige is offered as a variant for passengers who want more interior space than the A319 offers. It has a passenger capacity of 30, with two removable fuel tanks. In 2018, its unit cost was $115M.


### ACJ321

The A321 is the largest narrow-body corporate jet with a full passenger range of 4,200 nmi (7,800 km).


### ACJ319neo/ACJ320neo

Two A320neo family variants are offered: the ACJ319neo, carrying eight passengers up to 6,750 nmi (12,500 km), and the ACJ320neo, carrying 25 up to 6,000 nmi (11,000 km).
The CFM LEAP or Pratt & Whitney PW1000G lower fuel-burn provides additional range along with lower engine noise while the cabin altitude does not exceed 6,400 ft (2,000 m).
To increase its fuel capacity, the ACJ319neo is offered with up to five additional centre tanks (ACT).

The ACJ320neo first flight was on 16 November 2018, starting a short test programme for the extra fuel tanks and greater cabin pressurisation. It was first delivered to Acropolis Aviation on 16 January 2019. On 25 April 2019, the ACJ319neo completed its first flight, before a short test campaign and delivery to German K5 Aviation, outfitted with five ACTs. The CFM Leap-powered ACJ319neo was certified by the EASA on 9 July. In 2023, the equipped price of the ACJ319neo was $107.5M, and $117M for the ACJ320neo.


### ACJ321LR

Long-range neo variant. The ACJ321LR has a range of 8,175 nmi (15,140 km) which is the longest range of any narrowbody plane. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


### ACJ TwoTwenty

In October 2020, Airbus announced an ACJ variant of the A220-100, to be known as the ACJ TwoTwenty, with a range of 5,650 nmi (10,460 km) and cabin space of 73 m² (790 sq ft) for 18 passengers. To increase its range the ACJ Two twenty is offered with up to five removable auxiliary centre tanks (ACT).

The ACJ TwoTwenty made its first flight on 14 December 2021, before delivery to Comlux to be outfitted with a VIP cabin in Indianapolis. In 2022, its equipped price was $80M. The first aircraft was delivered on 28 April 2023.

## Wide-body aircraft

The VIP widebodies are based on the A330/A340/A350/A380 aircraft. Additional fuel tanks extend the range, with the greatest increase for the A330 Prestige.


### ACJ330-200

The A330-200 Prestige offers space for 60 passengers with a range of 8,300 nmi (15,400 km).


### ACJ330neo

The ACJ330neo is based on the new A330neo with the "Harmony" cabin concept. It has a capacity of 25 passengers and a range of 10,400 nmi (19,260 km).


### ACJ340-300

Based on Airbus' first four engine design, the ETOPS immune A340-300 Prestige offers a 7,700 nmi (14,300 km) range for 75 passengers. It is powered by four CFM56-5C4/P engines, each rated at 151 kN (34,000 lbf) thrust.


### ACJ340-500

The ACJ340-500 is a longer-range complement to the A340-300 Prestige with a 10,000 nmi (19,000 km) range as a result of having a higher fuel capacity and an updated wing with increased span and area. It carries 75 passengers and can link almost any imaginable city pair on the globe. It is powered by four Rolls-Royce Trent 556 engines, each rated at 249 kN (56,000 lbf).


### ACJ340-600

The ACJ340-600 is a version of the A340-600 with range increased to 8,500 nmi (15,700 km).


### ACJ350

The A330 and A340 successor A350 XWB is also offered as the ACJ350 corporate jet by Airbus Corporate Jets, offering a 10,800 nmi (20,000 km) range for 25 passengers for the -900 derivative and 270 square metres (2,900 sq ft) of cabin space. This range is the distance between two antipodes, allowing connection with any suitable airport.


### ACJ380-800

One executive variant of the Airbus A380 was ordered in 2012, with two full decks and a third deck in the cargo compartment, but the aircraft was sold as a regular aircraft before modifications were made. Range was to be increased to 8,900 nmi (16,500 km). The undelivered plane, ordered by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, was to be called "Prestige". *The Guardian* reported the plane was sold amid disputes between *Forbes* and Talal relating to the size of his fortune and his efforts to affect his ranking on the Forbes billionaires list.

As of May 2018ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, plans to retrofit one of the first A380s to be retired from service with Singapore Airlines as a business jet were reported to be "at a very advanced stage". Refitting a retired A380 would cost less than buying a new A330 or Boeing 777 business jet.
