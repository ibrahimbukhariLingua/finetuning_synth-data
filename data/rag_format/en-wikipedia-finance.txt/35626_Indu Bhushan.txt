## Ayushman Bharat Yojana

In his role as CEO Ayushman Bharat, various media outlets have interviewed Bhushan about his plans for addressing the challenges which the Indian government faces in providing health care.

Bhushan said that the biggest difficulty for implementing Ayushman Bharat was rapidly increasing the number of available hospital beds in rural areas without greatly increasing the government's cost per bed.

At a talk hosted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry, Bhushan gave the opinion that the Indian government should increase its investment in healthcare. He also described that India could greatly advance its efficiency in healthcare through digital reform after the model of India adopting financial technology to improve finance in India. He emphasized that medical privacy for patients has to be secure for any health data. He compared the privacy and security of the Unified Payments Interface for his own plans in medicine through the National Digital Health Mission.

A year into running the Ayushman Bharat scheme, Bhushan again spoke of personal privacy in an interview. In another interview he described heavily he relied on technological development to achieve goals, while again stating the need for privacy.
