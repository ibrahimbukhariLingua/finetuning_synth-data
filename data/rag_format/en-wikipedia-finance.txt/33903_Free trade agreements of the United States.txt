The United States is party to many free trade agreements (FTAs) worldwide.

Beginning with the Theodore Roosevelt administration, the United States became a major player in international trade, especially with its neighboring territories in the Caribbean and Latin America. The United States helped negotiate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (later the World Trade Organization).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
