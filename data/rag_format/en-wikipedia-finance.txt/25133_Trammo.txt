## History

Transammonia, founded by Ronald P. Stanton in 1965, specialized in the international trade of ammonia. Transammonia has since evolved as a market leader in petroleum coke, sulfur, anhydrous ammonia, and sulfuric acid, with niche positions in nitric acid and finished fertilizer. The Company changed its name from Transammonia, Inc. to Trammo, Inc. on October 29, 2013. The Trammo trademark has long been associated with the company and had been the name of several subsidiaries. The name change reflected the current broad range of products and markets in which the company trades, in addition to ammonia.

In the fiscal year that ended on May 1, 1990, Transammonia posted sales of US$1.1 billion.
In 2006, the company ventured into natural gas gathering in the United States. In 2007, the company was ranked by *Forbes* magazine as among the top 50 private companies in the United States. In 2012, the company was ranked as #24 by *Forbes* magazine in its list of the largest private companies in the United States. In 2022, the company was ranked as #13 in Crain's list of the largest privately held companies in the New York area and #133 in the Forbes magazine's list of the largest private companies in the United States. In the fiscal year that ended December 31, 2021, Trammo posted sales of over US$4.2 billion.


## Controversy

In 2010, Transammonia ended the dealings of its Swiss subsidiary, Trammo Trading, with Iranian companies, in part as a response to an investigation by [CNBC] regarding the company's involvement with entities within Iran. The United States has prohibitions against commerce in Iran, in part to persuade that country to disengage in nuclear development. Transammonia maintained that its foreign subsidiary's Iranian dealings were allowed under U.S. law, but decided to end them anyway. The company stated, "the small amount of business done there does not justify the reputational risk currently associated with doing business with entities located in Iran, due to the growing international concern over the policies of the current regime there."
