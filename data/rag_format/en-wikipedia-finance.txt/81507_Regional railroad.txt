Regional railroad


# Regional railroad



In the United States, a **regional railroad** is a railroad company that is not Class I but still has a substantial amount of traffic or trackage (and thus is not a short line railroad). The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has defined the lower bound as 350 miles (560 km) of track or $40 million in annual operating revenue. (The Class I threshold is $250 million, adjusted for inflation since 1991.)
