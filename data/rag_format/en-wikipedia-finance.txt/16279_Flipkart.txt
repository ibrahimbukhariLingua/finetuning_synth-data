## History


### 2007–2010: Start-up phase

Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT Delhi and former Amazon employees.

Flipkart used aggressive discounts and focused on customer service to move towards a leadership position in the market. WeRead consisted of a large network of readers (~3 million) with around 60 million books.
