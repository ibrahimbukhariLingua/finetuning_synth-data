The Strategy Session


# The Strategy Session



***The Strategy Session*** was an investment television talk show on the CNBC television network that was aired for a half-hour, from noon to 12:30 ET, on weekdays. It was hosted by David Faber and Gary Kaminsky.

Debuting June 7, 2010, this program, along with the *Fast Money Halftime Report* (12:30-1 ET), replaced the first hour of *Power Lunch*, which itself had its runtime cut in half from two hours to one (1-2 ET).


## Cancellation

*The Strategy Session* was cancelled October 14, 2011 and replaced three days later by the newly expanded *Fast Money Halftime Report*, which itself doubled its runtime from 30 minutes to 60 minutes and also moved up to the noon ET timeslot.
