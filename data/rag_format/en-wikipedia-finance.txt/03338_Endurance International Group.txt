Endurance International Group


# Endurance International Group



**Endurance International Group, Inc.** (**EIG**), previously named **BizLand**, now part of Newfold Digital, was an IT services company specializing in web hosting. The company was founded in 1997 and headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, USA. In 2021 Endurance International Group merged with Web.com forming a new company, Newfold Digital. It is one of the Internet's largest webhosting providers, with a global market share of 3.5% according to W3Techs. The company was structured differently from other large hosting companies such as Rackspace, GoDaddy, or 1&1 Ionos. The company has grown its hosting and related business through numerous acquisitions.


## History

Until 2002, the company was named BizLand.

In 2011, Endurance was bought from Accel-KKR by Warburg Pincus and GS Capital Partners, for around $975 million. In September 2013, the company announced plans to raise $400 million in an IPO. The company announced it would list on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol EIGI. It went public in October 2013 raising $252 million selling shares to the public at $12 each. This was below the company's target goal of $400 million.

This path to increased size is similar to the path networking company Verio followed in the 1990s, using free cash flow and access to capital markets in acquiring assets to add to their corporate portfolio. The concept was to roll up small ISPs into one large ISP and achieve economies of scale. Endurance acquired hosting companies domestically and internationally.

In 2014, Endurance bought four Directi owned companies – BigRock, LogicBoxes, ResellerClub, and Webhosting.info – for $160 million.

In March 2015, the company announced an investment in Netherlands-based technology startup AppMachine, acquiring 40% of the company. In August 2015, EIG announced the acquisition of Site5 and Verio Web Hosting from NTT. It is estimated that EIG gained 86,000+ new subscribers through these acquisitions. In November 2015, the company acquired Constant Contact, and days later laid off 15% of their workforce. Also in November 2015, EIG acquired the assets of Ecommerce, LLC for $28 million.

In August 2018, the firm's CEO and CFO were fined US$8 million for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for misrepresenting company subscriber numbers.

Endurance acquired Ecomdash in October 2019 for $9.6 million in cash, and placed it under the Constant Contact group.

In November 2020, Clearlake Capital Group announced that it would acquire Endurance International Group for around $3 billion. At the closing of the deal in February 2021, Clearlake Capital announced a few wrinkles. Clearlake spun off the Endurance Web Presence division, including subsidiaries Domain.com, Bluehost, and HostGator.

Endurance Web Presence merged with Web.com to form a new company, Newfold Digital, in 2021. Newfold Digital is a joint venture between Clearlake Capital and Siris Capital Group, owner of Web.com since 2018.

Clearlake also spun off the Constant Contact division of Endurance into a separate joint venture between Clearlake and Siris.

In November 2022, Newfold Digital "signed a definitive agreement to purchase MarkMonitor, an industry-leading enterprise-level provider of domain management solutions" from Clarivate. MarkMonitor provides brand protection, anti-piracy, and domain-name registration services for a variety of Big Tech industry giants and other companies.
