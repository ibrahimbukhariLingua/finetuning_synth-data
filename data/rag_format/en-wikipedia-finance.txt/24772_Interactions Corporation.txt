## Technology

The Interactions platform is built on nearly 20 years of work and 131 patents. Its IVA solution combines traditional Conversational AI with Generative AI (GAI). Interactions patented Human Assisted Understanding (HAU), a process that blends Conversational AI with human understanding in real time to deliver conversational experiences across voice- and text-based customer-care channels.

Interactions also develops an agent-assist tool called Task Orchestration. When customers engage with self-service customer support through any channel, the Interactions IVA system quickly authenticates their identity and routes their requests, which removes the need for transferring calls or chats to agents. It also reduces the challenge of introducing AI-powered automation into complex contact center environments by eliminating the need for creating new APIs to communicate between systems and by interfacing with existing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. Additionally, it is designed for businesses to incorporate real-time human intelligence when needed, thereby ensuring businesses can adopt transparent, responsible AI protocols.

Interactions develops a real-time, audio-sensitive redaction platform named Trustera, which preemptively identifies and protects sensitive information like credit card numbers and solves compliance challenge in today’s contact-center environment: protecting a customer's Payment Card Information (PCI) anywhere it appears during a call.
