Seiden Law


# Seiden Law



**Seiden Law** is an American law firm founded by Robert Seiden headquartered in Manhattan, New York. It specializes in high-stakes litigation, arbitration, judgment enforcement, cross-border disputes, and economic sanctions.


## Notable Cases

The firm has become well-known for helping clients who have been the victims of fraud or dealing with business disputes.

Notably, it has developed a niche for American investors suing Chinese companies.
This started in 2013 when Seiden was asked to act as receiver on the ZST Digital Networks case.

The firm was also instrumental in securing the freezing of assets of Guo Wengui, who was arrested in 2023 on fraud charges.

Seiden led the case against Michael Ben-Ari, dubbed the Israeli Madoff, who ran the largest Ponzi scheme conducted in Israel. Operating through his company, EGFE, Ben-Ari is accused of misusing funds from American and Israeli clients, ultimately fleeing Israel on a false passport after posting bail.

The firm also represented the 13 clients in the case against Omar Khan, a businessman accused of orchestrating a fraudulent scheme through exclusive wine-tasting events. Khan allegedly persuaded wealthy investors to fund luxury wine dinners with rare vintages and top chefs, but instead, he reportedly pocketed much of the money. The plaintiffs, who claim losses exceeding $8.3 million, accused him of running a "Ponzi-like" scheme involving fraud, misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment.

The firm successfully represented plaintiffs in a case against hedge fund manager Paul Touradji, who was forced to pay $90m. The case is being re-tried after appeal and a hung jury.


### Israel-Hamas War

Following the Israel Hamas War, the firm filed a lawsuit against Iran, Syria, Binance, and its former CEO on behalf of several U.S. citizen victims and their family members, including released hostages and the family of an IDF soldier and a doctor killed by Hamas while aiding a victim. An amended complaint was later filed listing only plaintiffs Binance Holdings Ltd and Changpeng Zhao.

In November 2023, the firm was one of 200 law firms asking deans of the top 14 law schools to tone down anti-Semitic activities on campus.


### Bilalov Case

Former Russian senator and self-exiled U.S. resident Ahmed Bilalov and his Ukrainian business partner are suing Russian Sberbank in Manhattan federal court to enforce a Ukrainian judgment secured after Russian instrumentalities expropriated their business. The case seeks U.S. court recognition of the judgment under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.


## Recognition

The firm and several of its attorneys have been recognized variously for their work in litigation and financial law, as well as for their contributions in the legal sector. Attorneys of the firm have also provided comment in publications such as Law360 and Law.com's Corporate Counsel.

Attorneys at the firm have authored works published on Law360, ABA Litigation Journal, New York Law Journal, South China Morning Post, NewThinking and Wolters Kluwer.

The firm has been noted for its pro-bono work.

Seiden has been appointed by the Security Exchange Commission to administer victim funds pursuant to court order and as a Receiver over 35 times to oversee the management of companies in judgment enforcement matters, including on behalf of AT&T and several Chinese companies listed on NASDAQ.
