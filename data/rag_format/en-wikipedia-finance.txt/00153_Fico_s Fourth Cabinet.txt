## Issues


### Domestic policy


#### Rule of law

In December 2023, the Fourth Cabinet of Robert Fico introduced an amendment to the Criminal Code. The government proposed that the bill be debated in a fast-track legislative procedure, arguing that the status quo leads to human rights violations. The amendment included scrapping the Special Prosecutor's Office dealing with high-level corruption and lowering penalties for financial crimes. The fast-track legislative procedure faced widespread criticism from the parliamentary opposition, President Zuzana Čaputová, the European Commission and non-governmental organizations, resulting in a weeks-long opposition parliamentary obstruction and a series of demonstrations.

Critics have raised questions about potential conflicts of interest within the government coalition. They have noted that various individuals with perceived affiliations to the government, alongside accused members of the coalition parties, including the bill's rapporteur, MP Tibor Gašpar of Smer, could be directly affected by the proposed lowering of penalties. Their cases are also overseen by the Special Prosecutor's Office, which the amendment would abolish. The coalition government introduced the amendment, citing the need to shift towards a rehabilitative approach to justice, update the criminal code, and align with European Union standards. Proponent of the law, the Ministry of Justice led by Boris Susko of Smer published the brochure "Overview of Violations of the Principles of the Rule of Law in the Years 2020–2023".

The amendment was finally approved by the National Council on 8 February 2024. The final proposal also included a reduction of the statute of limitations in rape cases from 20 to 10 years, which again caused widespread criticism from the parliamentary opposition, President Zuzana Čaputová and non-governmental organizations. The government defended the reduction of the limitation period by motivating victims to report rape earlier, possibly allowing a return to the 20-year limitation period in the next amendment after the approval of the law.

President Zuzana Čaputová signed the law on 16 February, verbally clearly expressing her opposition to its content. The President argued that by signing the law instead of vetoing it, she wants to create enough time for the Constitutional Court to decide on her submission challenging the constitutionality of the law. As of February 2024, the Constitutional Court is expected to make its decision following the publication of the law in the collection of laws by the Ministry of Justice.


#### NGOs

Fico and some of his coalition members have shown their dislike for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil rights groups. On 30 April 2024, Slovakia's parliament approved in the first reading legislative amendment introduced by the Slovak National Party. The bill would require NGOs which annually receive more than €5,000 from outside of Slovakia to register as "foreign agents", raising fears of the label being used for organisations disliked by the current government.


#### Media

Fico and his political associates have stopped responding to and inviting to their press conferences reporters from some major news outlets that criticise the government, such as *Denník N*, Aktuality.sk, and *Sme*, along with broadcaster TV Markíza, calling them "enemy media", while giving preferential treatment to media more favourable to him. Pavol Szalai, the head of the EU and Balkans desk of Reporters Without Borders, stated that Fico was subjecting Slovakia's democracy to a "crash test".

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) stated: “RSF condemns the ruling parties’ verbal attacks, their attempts to restrict access to information and their questioning of the independence of the public broadcaster RTVS.”

The government has proposed a drastic cut in the financing of the RTVS, as well as a plan to split it into separate radio and television companies, attracting criticism from Reporters Without Borders and other organisations.

RSF, International Press Institute, European Federation of Journalists, Free Press Unlimited and European Centre for Press and Media Freedom have voiced their concerns in an open letter to the President and the National Council. They have stated that these government actions can weaken the independence of this media and endanger the freedom of the press in Slovakia.

In April 2024, the Government of Slovakia approved the Television and Radio Act proposed by prime minister Robert Fico and minister of culture Martina Šimkovičová over alleged partiality of the broadcaster. If the bill is supported by the Parliament of Slovakia, Radio and Television of Slovakia RTVS will be closed by the following June and replaced by a new broadcaster, named STVR.

The new broadcaster STVR was required by law to broadcast the Slovak national anthem once a day, a move seen as a nationalist gesture.

In June 2024, the Parliament of Slovakia voted in favor of the media laws. The Radio and Television of Slovakia (RTVS) was dissolved and replaced by a new media Slovak Television and Radio (STVR).


### Foreign policy


#### Ukraine

Fico is widely seen as pro-Russian, and his government has stopped militarily supporting Ukraine, saying he "will not send one bullet" to Ukraine. Fico has been opposing sanctions against Russia, with his standpoint on Ukraine being compared to that of Viktor Orbán. In an RTVS interview, Fico questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and independence, claiming that Ukraine is just a US puppet, sparking outrage in both Slovakia and Ukraine. He has also stated that Slovakia will veto Ukraine's NATO membership, and has pushed for a peace deal, even if Ukraine suffers territorial losses. His words regarding Ukraine have been described as "heartless", "vulgar" and "disgraceful".

Upon taking office, Fico officially ended Slovakia's arms supplies to Ukraine. However, he has since taken a somewhat different line on Ukraine in office than during his election campaign. During a meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal in January 2024, Fico promised not to block private Slovak arms companies from selling to Ukraine, not to block EU financial support for Ukraine, and to support the accession of Ukraine to the European Union. He described Slovakia's political differences with Ukraine as "minor" and claimed to support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Fico met with Russian president Vladimir Putin in December 2024 in Moscow to discuss primarily the transfer of Russian gas to Slovakia. He become the third Western leader to do so since the war started.
