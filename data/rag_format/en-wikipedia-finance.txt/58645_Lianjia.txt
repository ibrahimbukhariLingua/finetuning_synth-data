## History

Homelink was founded by Zuo Hui in November 2001 with an initial staff of 27 people. On December 2, its first offline brokerage office was opened at "Tianshuiyuan". In 2004, Homelink offered the strategy of "Non-price difference" and tried to reduce the price difference between the market price and trading price. Homelink also developed its own financial center to operate its equity and built professional teams for warrant and loan services in 2005. In 2006, Homelink proposed the concept of "exclusive listing" which owners singularly entrust their property to the company on receiving the promise of a sale within a certain period. If the company fails to deliver the sale within that period, it returns the property to the seller along with the payment of liquidated damages." Homelink launched its first online platform at lianjia.com.

In September 2014, the company was noted as "Beijing's largest real estate agency by market share" with 52% of the market, at which point it had 1,500 branches in eight cities. On October 24, 2014, Homelink stopped the cooperation with "Fang.com" and lost part of real-estate information and resources. But it changed its brand name to "Lianjia". In the same year, Homelink commenced two financial services. One is the third-party payment business "Lifangtong", which is responsible for fund trusteeship, and the other is a peer-to-peer (P2P) financial services "licailianjia". More specifically, "Lifangtong" has obtained a third-party payment license issued on July 15, 2015.
