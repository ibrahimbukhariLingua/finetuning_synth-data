# Dollar Savings Bank



**Dollar Savings Bank of New York** was a bank that operated in New York City between 1890 and 2004.


## History

Dollar Savings Bank of New York was formed on June 23, 1890, of possibly 1887, founded by John Haffen.

In February 1983, after it was on the verge of bank failure, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department arranged for a merger of the bank with Dry Dock Savings Bank to form Dollar Dry Dock Savings Bank.

On February 21, 1992, the bank and its 21 branches were seized by the New York State Banking Department with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation named as receiver. Emigrant Savings Bank bought 20 of the branches and the Flushing branch was purchased by Apple Bank.

In 2011, the headquarters building in the Bronx was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
