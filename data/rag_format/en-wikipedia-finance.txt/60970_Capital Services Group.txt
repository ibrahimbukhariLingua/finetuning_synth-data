## History

Capital Servicing Co., Ltd., the first and largest operation of the Capital Services Group is based in Tokyo, and obtained servicer license no. 23 from the Japanese Ministry of Justice in September 1999. Capital Servicing initially commenced operations as a special servicer, focusing on asset work-out for non-performing loan portfolios for U.S. investment banks, but as the Japanese distressed debt markets matured, it developed its primary servicing and real estate asset management functions shortly thereafter.

In 2000, CSG established its first operation in South East Asia in Bangkok, Thailand and has since operated companies throughout the region.
