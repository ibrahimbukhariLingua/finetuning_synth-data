# Hossein Hedayati



**Hossein Hedayati** is an Iranian business tycoon who most notably purchased Steel Azin F.C. and invested into Persepolis F.C.


## Football

Hedayati gained popularity among a large group of football fans in Iran, but he was never a part of the club Persepolis F.C. Yet he invested large sum of money into the prominent club just as a supporter. He has also been the owner of Steel Azin F.C. since 2007. While always a controversial figure for his unknown background, there has never been a doubt about his influence on Iranian football. After his takeover of Ekbatan FC he transformed a struggling Azadegan League side, into a dominant force in the Persian Gulf Cup. That team also included Ali Karimi who was often the cause of trouble at the club. Following a dispute with the then team CEO, Sardar Hajilou, Ali Karimi was punished for an indefinite time. Hedayati did not want to kick him out of the club due to their friendship.
