The **Nonbusiness energy property tax credit**, in the United States, provides a nonrefundable personal tax credit for Federal income tax purposes, for making a home more energy efficient. (Unlike a deduction, which lowers taxable income, a tax credit reduces the actual tax paid, dollar-for-dollar.) This credit was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The nonbusiness energy property credit expired on December 31, 2017, but was retroactively extended for tax years 2018 and 2019 on December 20, 2019 as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (2020 United States federal budget). Further information about the legislation that extended the credit is at IRS.gov/Extenders.
