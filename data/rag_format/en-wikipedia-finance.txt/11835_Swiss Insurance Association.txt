## Members

The Swiss Insurance Association (SIA) is the industry association for Swiss private insurers. With approximately 70 members – including global primary insurers and reinsurers as well as nationally oriented specialist property, life and supplementary health insurers – the association represents over 95 per cent of the insurance premiums generated in Switzerland. The SIA is committed to the insurance industry’s sustainable development and promotes solutions that contribute to the stability and security of the Swiss economy and society. As such, the private insurance industry makes a significant contribution to prosperity within Switzerland. The sector is one of the most productive and highest value-creating economic sectors in the country and employs roughly 50,000 employees. 2025 sees the SIA celebrate its 125th anniversary.


## Structure

The SIA is an association ("Verein") in accordance with article 60ss. of the Swiss Civil Code. Its main bodies are elected by the general assembly. The Managing Board sets the objectives and establishes the strategy of the SIA; it also monitors the activities of the head office. Committees and commissions, consisting of highly qualified representatives of the membership, are in charge of drafting solutions in the interest of the entire insurance industry. The SIA head office is divided into the three divisions "Insurance Strategy and Regulation", "Public Affairs and Communications" and "Directorate".


## History

The history of the private insurance industry goes back to the 19th century when the first private insurance companies were founded. Many of these companies are active to this day, namely Mobiliar (founded in 1826), Swiss Life (1857), Helvetia (1858), Bâloise (1863), Swiss Re (1863), Zurich (1872) or Winterthur (1875). The SIA's predecessor – the "Verband concessionierter schweizerischer Versicherungs-Gesellschaften" – was founded in 1900 and made up of 21 insurance companies. Today the association is called SIA and has some 80 members.


## Supervisory authority

The member companies of the SIA are subject to supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Compulsory basic health insurance, the Swiss Accident Insurance Institution SUVA, the cantonal buildings insurers and the autonomous pension funds are not considered private insurers. FINMA is in charge of client protection and monitors the insurers’ ability to continuously meet their contractual obligations. The SIA shares the general interest in a strong and competent regulator.


## Memberships

The SIA is a member of national and international associations and organisations. It represents its members’ interests and concerns namely vis-à-vis economiesuisse, the Swiss Employers Confederation and the Swiss Chamber of Commerce. Its membership in the European (re)insurance federation Insurance Europe and the Global Federation of Insurance Associations GFIA are of particular relevance.
