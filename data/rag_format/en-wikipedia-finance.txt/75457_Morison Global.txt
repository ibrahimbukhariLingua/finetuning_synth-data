## History

Morison Global was formed in 2016 from a merger of two organisations Morison International and KS International.

Both associations were established after the same ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales) dinner in 1990 organised for French and UK accounting firms to forge links. Aplitec met Morison Stoneham who went on to form Morison International and Kingston Smith met Cabinet Sorel who went on to form KS International.


## Morison International

The association is the legacy of Walter Morison (26 November 1919 – 26 March 2009) a Royal Air Force pilot who became a prisoner of war and was sent to Colditz for attempting to steal an enemy aircraft during the Second World War.

Following the war, Morison qualified as a chartered accountant at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales. He was articled at Morison Stoneham, a firm established by his great uncle. Morison then worked at Coopers Bros, the firm that became Coopers & Lybrand, before returning to his family firm, Morison Stoneham. He led the firm as a senior partner through a period of great change from 1960 to 1981 before retiring. Morison Stoneham was the founding firm of Morison International.
