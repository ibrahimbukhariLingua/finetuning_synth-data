## History

## Product development


### Rociletinib

The company was developing rociletinib, as a treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. A phase III trial was completed in April 2016 and had it been approved it would have competed with AstraZeneca's Tagrisso (osimertinib). According to the company web site as of November 2016 studies on the drug are no longer accepting new patients, but Clovis would continue to supply the drug to patients whose physicians had recommended continued treatment.

In September 2018, the company and two former executives agreed to a $20 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on claims it exaggerated to investors the efficacy of Roci in patient trials.


### Rucaparib

Rucaparib is a PARP inhibitor in Phase II and III clinical trials for advanced ovarian cancer. In December 2016, the Food and Drug Administration granted an accelerated approval for the use of rucaparib "for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies". In 2023, rucaparib was sold to Pharmaand GmbH (Pharma&) as part of Clovis's bankruptcy proceedings.


### Lucitanib

Lucitanib is a VEGFR inhibitor. It is also an inhibitor of FGFR1 and FGFR2 and has undergone clinical trials for advanced solid tumors.
