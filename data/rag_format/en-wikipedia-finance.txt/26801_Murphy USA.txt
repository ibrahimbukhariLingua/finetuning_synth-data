# Murphy USA



**Murphy USA** is an American corporation based in El Dorado, Arkansas that operates a chain of retail gas stations that are primarily located in proximity to Walmart stores. It was founded as a spin-off of Murphy Oil in 2013.

In the first quarter of 2016, Murphy USA announced a change in its relationship with Walmart, as they began opening their own in-house gas stations and convenience stores. It plans to increase its locations independently of Walmart sites. In 2016, Murphy USA announced that Core-Mark would be the sole distributor for their chain. It said, "...this partnership will allow Murphy to offer a larger selection of popular convenience store products."

On December 14, 2020, Murphy USA announced that it has reached an agreement to purchase QuickChek convenience stores, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, for $645 million.

As of June 2024, it was ranked 214 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue and ranked 89 on the Fortune's 100 Fastest-Growing Companies.
