## History

Kreston Global was formed in London in 1971 by two entrepreneurs, Gabriel Brösztl and Michael Ross when the German firm Bansbach (at the time led by Gabriel Brösztl) formed a relationship with the UK firm Finnie.

The first member firm, Groupe Fiduciaire Kreston in Paris, was added shortly after. In 1981 Kreston Global had six firms in UK, Netherlands, West Germany, Denmark, France and Sweden.

By 1991, the group expanded and established a formal structure. In 2000, after serving as Chairman of Kreston for 29 years, Dr Gabriel Brösztl stood down.

In 2001, the Group expanded its operations to mainland China. Clive Stevens, Chairman of Kreston Reeves UK, began serving as Kreston Chairman, a role which he held until 2012.

In 2008, Exco France, a network of 23 independent firms, located throughout France, and its correspondent members in 11 French-speaking African countries joined Kreston Group. The group also added additional locations in Poland, West Indies, New Caledonia and Reunion. That same year, Costa Rica was added to Kreston's Central America group which also included El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. In 2011, Kreston was named a full member of the Forum of Firms. In 2012, Franck Parker, CEO of Exco France, took up the role of Kreston International Chairman. Also in 2012, the Kreston Academies Benchmark UK Report was launched, Kreston's joint annual publication that assesses the finances of 1,400 academy schools in 300 academy trusts.

In 2015, firms in the major markets of the UK (Kreston Reeves and James Cowper Kreston), Germany and the Netherlands joined the Kreston. In 2016–2018, new member firms in South-East Asia, Middle East, Europe and Africa joined the Kreston Group. In 2022 new firms in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Lebanon, amongst others, joined the Group.
