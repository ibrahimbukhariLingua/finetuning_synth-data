# 3 Hardman Street



**3 Hardman Street** is a 16-storey high-rise building in Spinningfields, Manchester, England.

## Background

3 Hardman Street was designed by architects Sheppard Robson, as part of the Allied London project regenerating Spinningfields into a major business centre. According to Allied London chief executive Mike Ingall, "3 Hardman Street has been designed in particular for the financial and professional services sector for Manchester".

The building was completed in February 2009, and it was the largest speculatively developed office outside London at the time. (A speculative development is construction with no formal commitment from tenants). The building was 80% let before completion. The building has a BREEAM rating of excellent. The building is 16-storeys tall with one floor used as a plant floor. The building also has two underground levels which hold 250 parking spaces.

In 2010, Allied London sold the building for £183.5 million. It was bought by Glenn Arrow UK Property, which is owned by the Luxembourg-based company, Ærium. Allied London continues to manage the building.
