In 1847, McLean began working for the Citizens Fire Insurance Company, later serving as Secretary and President for nearly forty years.

Beginning in 1860, McLean was elected and served as president of the New York Board of Fire Underwriters for four years. In this role, he was a "prominent factor in creating harmony among local fire insurance companies, and in establishing the present Fire Department." Upon the formation of the National Board of Fire Underwriters in 1866, he served as its first president and was reelected to a second term.

McLean also served as president, and long-time director, of the Manhattan Life Insurance Company (following the resignation of Henry Stokes), an original director and co-founder of the Manhattan Savings Bank, an original director of the National City Bank (predecessor bank of Citibank), and vice-president of the Union Trust Company.

In addition to his corporate work, McLean served as president of the New York City Board of Education for four years, was a trustee of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge, and served as president of the Institute for the Blind. In 1873, he became the 20th President of the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, a charitable organization in New York City of men who are descended from early inhabitants of the State of New York.
