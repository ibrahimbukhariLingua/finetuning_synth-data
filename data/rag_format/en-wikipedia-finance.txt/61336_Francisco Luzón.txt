His career began at Banco de Vizcaya in 1972, where he worked in various branches across Spain. He achieved various high-ranking international positions within the bank until he became Director in 1987. In 1988, he oversaw the merger between Banco de Vizcaya and Banco de Bilbao, which formed the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and saw Luzón as its first director.

In 1989, Minister of Economy and Finance Carlos Solchaga appointed Luzón to lead the Banco Exterior de España [es], succeeding Miguel Boyer, thanks to his experience in the banking sector of Spain.

From 1993 to 1998, it went through a process of privatization and increased in value by 800 billion pesetas. In 1996, he became Director of the Banco Santander and served as General Deputy Director to its President, Emilio Botín.

He signed over 700 agreements within the network and added over 19 million students and teachers. At the same time, he promoted Fudis, a program dedicated to training professional talent in Latin America, which helped 350 students access positions at the executive level.
