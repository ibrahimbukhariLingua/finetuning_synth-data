Liebreich created New Energy Finance in 2004 as a specialist provider of information on clean energy and resources for the finance and energy industries, manufacturers and policymakers. He reportedly started the company with "the help of interns and a Polish programmer he found on Rent A Coder". By 2011, he had built the company to a staff of nearly 200.

In 2011, Liebreich was the executive producer of a video short illustrating the world's ultimate shift away from fossil fuels, titled "First They Ignore You...".

In February 2015 he wrote a piece critical of the draft UN Sustainable Development Goals, due to be adopted later in the year, suggesting instead that they be replaced by 12 alternative goals which are not overtly anti-business.


### Bloomberg New Energy Finance

Liebreich sold his company (formerly New Energy Finance) to Bloomberg L.P. in 2009 in hopes of strengthening the company's position in the energy industry.

Bloomberg L.P. Chairman Peter Grauer stated: “This acquisition is the next step in Bloomberg’s initiative to develop and promote the carbon and clean energy markets.” Since 2009, Liebreich acted as the CEO of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, where he oversaw the delivery of investment-grade information about the world's energy industry. In January 2014, Liebreich stepped down as CEO of BNEF and is now Chairman of the Advisory Board.

In 2014 rumours began to circulate that Liebreich was a potential Conservative candidate for Mayor of London. In June 2014, he was reported to have higher odds of winning than better known politicians including David Lammy and George Galloway according to data from bookmaker Paddy Power.

In March 2015 he wrote a piece entitled “The Good Right must be a Green Right” for Tim Montgomerie’s Good Right project, arguing any truly conservative agenda would include as a foundational principle care for our physical environment.

## Philanthropy

In 2010, Liebreich set up the Liebreich Foundation, a family charity which applies funds to charitable causes at the discretion of the trustees.

In 2018, Liebreich launched a charitable campaign named Project Bo which raised money to support a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in the city of Bo, Sierra Leone. The campaign set out to fund the purchase of a 20 kW solar and storage system in order to provide uninterrupted power to a ward which incurred frequent power shortages resulting in equipment malfunctions and consequently unnecessary deaths.

The campaign was successful in reaching its target of £100,000 and the power system went live in September, 2018.
