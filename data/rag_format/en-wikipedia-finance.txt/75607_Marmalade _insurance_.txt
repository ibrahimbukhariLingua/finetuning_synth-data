# Marmalade (insurance)



**Marmalade** is a UK-based insurance company whose main business is car insurance for young people. The company uses telematics, a satellite technology that monitors the use of the car the company is insuring. This monitors the way the car is driven, when is driven and sends the information back to Marmalade. This information is used to change the amount Marmalade charges the driver for insurance, if the company identifies a bad driver it will increase their premiums and may cancel their policy. From May to July 2011 this technology allowed the company to cut its insurance premiums by 17 per cent at a time when the industry trend was for premiums for young drivers to increase.

At the Road Safety GB Conference on 13 November 2009 the company received the Prince Michael International Road Safety Award for its contribution to Road Safety in the UK.
