# Oschadbank



The **State Savings Bank of Ukraine**, or **Oschadbank** (Ukrainian: Ощадбанк), is a major public bank in Ukraine. In early 2024, it was confirmed by the National Bank of Ukraine as one of the country's systemically important banks.

In April 2022, Oschadbank became a member of the Individual Deposit Guarantee Fund (FGVFO).

As of the first of July, 2023, the bank had 1,183 branches and 2,790 ATMs throughout the country which carry out various functions, such as the disbursement of pensions, social aid, processing of utility payments and other banking transactions.

The head office of Oschadbank is located in Kyiv. As of 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the bank received a net profit of ₴2.78 billion, which is ₴2.5 billion more than in 2019.


## History

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian operations of the Savings Bank of the USSR were reorganized as a stand-alone institution, the State Specialized Commercial Savings Bank of Ukraine.²⁵ On 21 May 1999, the latter was transformed by Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine into Oschadbank, a joint-stock company.

According to the British magazine The Banker, in 2014 Oschadbank ranked 10th in the ranking of the largest banks in Central and Eastern Europe and 367th in the ranking of the top 1000 world banks.

As of the end of 2016, the bank had 3,650 branches and 2,850 ATMs throughout the country. Together with PrivatBank, Oschadbank was one of the few twoᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠʸ Ukrainian banks whose clients' time deposits are fully guaranteed by state law compared to total of ₴ 200,000 in other banks in case of bank liquidation. (However, since martial law was declared in 2022 in response to the open, full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian military, the deposit guarantee has been extended much more broadly)

For a long time, the bank remained the only one of 74 Ukrainian banks that was not a member of the Deposit Guarantee Fund. In April 2022, the Law of Ukraine "On Amendments to Certain Laws of Ukraine on Ensuring the Stability of the Deposit Guarantee System" came into force, which aims to increase depositors' confidence in the banking system and ensure its stability. It is within the framework of this law that Oschadbank joined the DGF.
