Energy in Europe


# Energy in Europe



**Energy in Europe** includes energy, including electricity, production, consumption and import in Europe.

Primary energy consumption across European countries, highlights diverse energy use patterns. Countries show fluctuations in consumption, reflecting changes in energy demand and policy. Germany and the Russian Federation are among the highest consumers, smaller economies like Lithuania and Turkmenistan have markedly lower consumption levels. Per person energy use in Europe varies significantly, with smaller nations like Iceland, showing high consumption rates per million people, indicating the diverse energy use and economic activities across the continent. Europe has significant reliance on oil, a major energy source predominantly used for transportation and heating, with most European countries importing most of their oil needs due to limited domestic production.

There has been an increase in renewable energy, with plans to increase wind power capacity. The European Commission's "REPowerEU" plan underscores a commitment to renewables. There is an ongoing transition towards more sustainable energy systems in Europe.


## Primary energy consumption by country

Primary energy consumption for selected European and Eurasian countries in million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) from 2010 to 2015, according to BP, is listed below.

Mtoe = 11.63 TWh primary energy, includes energy losses


## Oil

Oil is one of the largest primary energy sources in Europe. It is mostly used for transportation and heating.
Oil production is relatively low in Europe, with significant production only in the North Sea. Most of Europe's oil comes from imports (about 90% for the EU28).


## Electricity


### Renewable energy

The twelve newer EU Member States in Central and Eastern Europe planned to increase wind power capacity from the 6.4 gigawatts installed at the end of 2012 to 16 gigawatts by 2020.

If renewable electricity production in the EU continued to grow at the same rate as it did from 2005 to 2010, it would account for 36.4% of electricity in 2020 and 51.6% in 2030, following:

| Renewable energy as a percentage of total electricity | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2020 | 2030 |
| 13.6 | 14.2 | 15 | 16.4 | 18.2 | 21 | 36 | 52 |

In March 2022, the European Commission released its comprehensive "REPowerEU" plan to promote renewable energy in Europe.
