## Bribery conviction

On February 8, 2017, former deputy attorney-general Rikkos Erotokritou, lawyers Andreas Kyprizoglou and Panayiotis Neocleous, and the Andreas Neocleous & Co LLC law firm were found guilty by the Nicosia criminal court. Panayiotis Neocleous and the Neocleous law firm were found guilty of bribery, conspiracy, and corruption.
The four were said to have colluded to arrange for Erotokritou to launch the criminal prosecution of five Russian individuals and one company, at the behest and to the benefit of the Neocleous law firm, which had long been battling them in Cypriot and Russian courts over ownership and control of Providencia, a trust-fund worth hundreds of millions.
