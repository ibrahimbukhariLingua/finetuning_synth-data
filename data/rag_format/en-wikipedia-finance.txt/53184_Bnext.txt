# Bnext



**Bnext** is a Spanish fintech based in Madrid, Spain. It officially launched on March 30, 2017 and in February 2020 officially became registered as a digital money entity by the Bank of Spain.


## History

The company was created by Guillermo Vicandi and Juan Antonio Rull√°n de la Mata with the initial development of an application in September 2016. In February 2017, it was selected by the Plug and Play Tech Center to make a round of crowdfunding in Crowdcube in which it obtained 300,000 euros to expand.

The structure of Bnext followed the same as other neobanks by not having a banking license and just a e-money license where users could load money into their cards and use it worldwide without any foreign transaction fees. The app also allows users to connect other bank accounts as a way to manage their finances.
