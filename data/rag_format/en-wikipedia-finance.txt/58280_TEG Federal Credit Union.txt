## History

In 1969, teachers from the Wappingers Central school district decided to create an alternative to the banks they had been using. Desiring a financial institution that would provide fair and equitable treatment, they successfully chartered the Wappingers Central Federal Credit on April 25, 1969, with the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).

In March 1976, credit union membership expanded to include the government workers of Dutchess County and the credit union's name changed to Taconic Educational and Governmental Federal Credit Union, or TEG Federal Credit Union as it is known by today.

In August 2000, TEG received a new community charter and opened its doors to all who lived, worked, worshiped, or attended school in Dutchess County. The most recent extension of this charter in December 2002 opened up the membership to all who live, work, worship or attend school in New York's Dutchess, Orange and Ulster Counties. TEG Federal provides an annual $1,000 scholarship to student members.
