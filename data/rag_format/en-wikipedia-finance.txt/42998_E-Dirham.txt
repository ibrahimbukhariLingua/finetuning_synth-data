E-Dirham


# E-Dirham



The **e-Dirham** is a payment tool introduced by the government of the United Arab Emirates with the aim of facilitating the collection of revenues of governmental and non-governmental service fees in a safe and secure way.

The e-Dirham was initially intended for use by the UAE federal government, but it was later used by the local governments of the constituent Emirates, as well as by semi-governmental organizations and private enterprises.

The e-Dirham was launched on 3 February 2001, making UAE the first country within the Arab Region to introduce such a system countrywide.

The e-Dirham has become widely available, and has many payment channels. The Ministry of Finance and Industry has worked and is still working on expanding payment channels. Currently available payment channels include

* Electronic point of sale (EPOS) terminals
* Over the Internet (E-Dirham Payment Gateway)
* E-Stamp

## Card Types

The e-Dirham Cards can be described as a **Secure Electronic Purse** and currently have two versions as per the following:

**The Fixed Value Card**

The Ministry of Finance and Industry has made available the e-Dirham cards with fixed value for a number of denominations that can be bought at face value from a number of banks (e-Dirham Members).

The current available denominations are AED 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 3000 and 5000.

**The Government Client Card**

On 24 June 2001, the Ministry of Finance & Industry has launched a new card named as “Government Client Cards”. This represents the second generation of the e-Dirham.

This card type is intended for frequent users of governmental services, and can be obtained by individuals or companies. The advantage of this card that it is personalized so that no one else could use this card except for the card holder which was originally issued to.
