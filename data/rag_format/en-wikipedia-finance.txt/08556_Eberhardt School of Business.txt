Eberhardt School of Business


# Eberhardt School of Business



**University of the Pacific Eberhardt School of Business** is one of seven schools and colleges of the University of the Pacific. The business school is located in Weber Hall on the school's main campus in Stockton, California.

The Eberhardt School of Business is a fully accredited member of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. AACSB accreditation represents the highest standard of achievement for business schools worldwide. The School was renamed the Eberhardt School of Business in 1995 in recognition of the generous and substantial support given to both the School and the University by the Eberhardt family. Robert M. Eberhardt (a 1950 Business alumnus) succeeded his father as President of the Bank of Stockton and Chair of the Board of Regents. After his unexpected death in 1993, his wife, Mimi Eberhardt, assumed his position as a regent, while his brother, Douglass, a Class of 1959 Business alumnus, became President of the Bank of Stockton. Douglass Eberhardt subsequently became a regent of Pacific. Nine members of the Eberhardt family have received degrees from the University, and numerous employees of the Bank of Stockton and their families are Pacific alumni.

### Eberhardt Student Investment Fund

The Eberhardt School of Business offers a two-term class for MBA and undergraduate business students called the Eberhardt Student Investment Fund (ESIF). Students are selected through a formal application process and have the ability to manage an investment portfolio currently approaching 5.0 million dollars. The Bank of Stockton and its President and CEO Douglass Eberhardt, sponsors the fund.

Two hundred of the 9,000 business schools worldwide operate a student investment fund. In the Eberhardt SIF, students do research and evaluation, write reports, and make choices regarding where and how to invest the fund's money. This is not a virtual investment or portfolio; this is real money and real investments.

Students participating in the ESIF will be accountable to its board, which consists of the dean, the vice president of business and finance for the university, and four investment professionals. An annual report of their investment activities and results will be written by the students and their work, transactions, and report are audited by an independent accounting firm, just like in a real investment fund.
