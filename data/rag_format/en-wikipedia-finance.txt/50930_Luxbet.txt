Luxbet was a subsidiary of Tabcorp. It commenced operations on 1 October 2008. Luxbet ceased operated on 22 December 2017, following the merger between Tabcorp and Tatts Group.


## History

Luxbet was launched by Tabcorp as a complement to the gambling services already offered. Luxbet was positioned to offer gambling products that Tabcorp had been precluded from offering including betting on non-sport related events such as elections and entertainment.

In 2013, revenue generated by Luxbet exceeded $39 million which was up more than 40% from the previous year.

Luxbet’s success directly contributes to the support given to the racing industry by Tabcorp. In addition to the payment of taxes, race fields fees and product fees, Tabcorp also pays a share of Luxbet’s profits to each of the NSW and Victorian racing industries.

In 2015 Luxbet launched Luxbet Europe offering gambling services to the European market.
