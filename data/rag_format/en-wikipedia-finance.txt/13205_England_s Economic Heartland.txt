The NIC's report, Partnering for Prosperity, said England's Economic Heartland had gained 'recognition at national level', and 'received
financial backing from the Department for Transport to advance an ambitious programme of work, including the development of an overarching transport strategy and work to identify and define a major road network across the arc'.


## Sub-national Transport Body status

In summer 2017, England's Economic Heartland consulted on becoming a Sub-national Transport Body (STB).
