The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven Emirates, with autonomous federal and local governments. The UAE has historically been a low-tax jurisdiction. The federal government and local governments are entitled to levy taxes on citizens and companies. The federal government currently levies a value added tax, corporate income tax, and excise taxes. Some emirates levy property, transfer, excise and tourism taxes. Some emirates also charge corporate taxes on oil companies and foreign banks.

The UAE federal tax system is administered by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA), which was founded ahead of the 2018 implementation of a federal value added tax (VAT). The current standard VAT rate in the country is 5%. In January 2022, the UAE Ministry of Finance announced the implementation of a federal corporate tax starting June 2023. The standard rate of corporate tax is 9%, some exempt businesses and those with net annual profits under AED375,000 (US$102,100) qualify for a rate of 0%, and that fall under the criteria of the global minimum corporate tax rate agreement are charged a corporate tax rate of 15%. Free zone businesses can get exempt from corporate tax as long as they do not do business with the UAE mainland and follow other UAE guidelines. The federal government also levies excise taxes on alcohol, energy drinks, vaping liquids and devices, and cigarettes.


## History

Since the discovery of oil in the UAE in the mid-1960s, the UAE federal and local governments had no incentive to levy direct taxes. Local governments received royalties from their emirate-owned oil companies, which local governments used to fund the federal government. Since then, the UAE has been working to diversify its economy and government revenue away from oil and other hydrocarbons; with taxes being a major source for diversifying government-revenue sources.


## Responsibilities and Functionalities

**Tax administration:** the FTA administers various taxes implemented in the UAE, including Value Added Tax (VAT), Excise Tax, and Corporate Tax. This includes the registration of taxpayers, collection of taxes, and processing of tax returns.

**Compliance and Enforcement:** The FTA monitors compliance with tax laws through audits and inspections. It ensures that businesses and individuals adhere to the regulatory requirements and addresses any issues of non-compliance.

**Guidance and Support:** The authority provides comprehensive guidance and resources to assist taxpayers in understanding their obligations. This includes detailed manuals, FAQs, and online tools to facilitate tax registration, filing, and payment.

**Online Services:** The FTA offers a digital platform where taxpayers can register for taxes, submit returns, and make payments. This online system is designed to streamline processes and enhance accessibility.

**Public Communication:** The FTA regularly updates taxpayers on new regulations, changes in tax policy, and other relevant information through its website and other communication channels.

The FTA’s efforts are essential in supporting the UAE’s economic goals by ensuring an effective and efficient tax system that aligns with international standards.

The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) is the government agency responsible for the administration and regulation of tax laws in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Established to oversee and enforce the country’s tax system, the FTA plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with tax regulations, supporting economic stability, and fostering a transparent business environment.


## Taxation Types in the United Arab Emirates


### **Value Added Tax (VAT):**

The UAE has implemented a federal Value Added Tax (VAT) with a standard rate of 5%. Some items are taxed at 0%, while others are exempt. Businesses with annual taxable supplies exceeding the AED 375,000 threshold must register for VAT, while those with supplies above AED 187,500 may register voluntarily. The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) overseas VAT collection and audits businesses to ensure compliance.


### **Excise Tax:**

**Excise Tax in the UAE: Overview and Purpose**

Excise tax in the UAE was introduced by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) in October 2017 to help curb the consumption of products detrimental to public health and the environment. It is a form of indirect tax levied on specific goods, focusing on items like tobacco products, carbonated beverages, energy drinks, and sweetened drinks. By increasing the prices of these products, the government aims to discourage consumption, promote healthier lifestyles, and reduce environmental harm.

**Products Subject to Excise Tax**

The FTA applies excise tax at varying rates depending on the product category:

* **Tobacco and tobacco products**: A 100% excise tax is levied on cigarettes, shisha tobacco, and other tobacco-related products.
* **Energy drinks**: These are also taxed at 100%, encompassing any beverages marketed as providing energy due to ingredients like caffeine or taurine.
* Carbonated drinks: A 50% tax is imposed on carbonated beverages, with an exemption for beverages that do not contain sugar or other sweeteners.
* **Sweetened beverages**: Introduced later, these beverages (including juices, sodas, or powdered drink mixes) are taxed at 50% if they contain added sugars or sweeteners.

This approach aligns with the government’s public health strategy, addressing the growing concerns of obesity, diabetes, and other health risks.


### Registration criteria

A business must register for VAT if their taxable supplies and imports exceed the mandatory registration threshold of AED375,000 (US$102,100). Furthermore, a business may choose to register for VAT voluntarily if their supplies and imports or expenses are less than the mandatory registration threshold, but exceed the voluntary registration threshold of AED187,500 (US$51,050). This latter opportunity to register voluntarily is designed to enable start-up businesses with no turnover to register for VAT. FTA has provided a complete list of documentation required for VAT registraton.


### De-registration criteria

If the annual turnover in 12 consecutive months is less than the voluntary registration threshold, the company or person may apply for de-registration in 20 days. Failing to submit de-registration application lead to a fine of up to AED10,000 (US$2720).


### Zero-rated items

VAT will be charged at 0% in respect of the following main categories of supplies:

* Exports of goods and services to outside the GCC;
* International transportation, and related supplies;
* Supplies of certain sea, air and land means of transportation (such as aircraft and ships);
* Certain investment grade precious metals (e.g. gold, silver, of 99% purity);
* Newly constructed residential properties, that are supplied for the first time within 3 years of their construction;
* Supply of certain education services, and supply of relevant goods and services;
* Supply of certain Healthcare services, and supply of relevant goods and services

### Exemptions

The following categories of supplies will be exempt from VAT:

* The supply of some financial services (clarified in VAT legislation);
* Residential properties;
* Bare land; and
* Local passenger transport

### VAT audit

According to the federal law, it's necessary for the FTA to conduct regular VAT audits to ascertain the compliance of various businesses to the tax laws. These audits are often conducted at the workplace or at the other place of business of the involved party, as per the selection of the FTA; the person/business should be given a minimum of 5 days notice. It is also directed by the authorities to maintain your VAT accounting as per the laws.


### VAT return filing

VAT Return Filing in Dubai is essential for taxable businesses. Once you have applied for VAT registration, your business will get the Tax Registration Number (TRN) and it is now mandatory to file VAT Return. As per standard, you need to file VAT returns every three monthly or quarterly.

VAT Return Filing period might vary based on your VAT registration. The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) mentioned the VAT return filing period on the VAT certificate. All the businesses who register for VAT should complete their VAT return filing as per the defined period on the VAT certificate. After filing VAT returns, you have to make VAT related payments within 28 days from the end of your tax period. Failing to file VAT returns will results in fines and penalties.


#### Procedures

The involved party/business/person can file their tax returns on the FTA portal as per the schedule.

The FTA authorities can check the returns and alternative details. There should not be a selected reason for the FTA to conduct an audit of a business/taxpayer. They will conduct it for any reason or whenever they are required.

A notice is going to be issued to the involved party, a minimum of 5 days before the regular audit date. It will contain details, like the audit schedule, place, concerned parties, reason (if something particular), etc.

The auditor/s and also the taxpayer can meet at the scheduled place at the scheduled time and the process can begin. The auditor might ask for business records, in original and/or copies, and take samples of products and alternative assets as obtainable at the place at the time.

Note: The audited party has the right to ask for the credentials, like professional identification cards, from the tax auditors so as to see their authority.

The tax audit is to be conducted during the official FTA operating hours, unless the Director-General decides to conduct the audit of a business outside regular hours, in an exceptional case.

The taxpayer or the other person subject to a tax audit, in conjunction with his legal representatives and tax agents, are advised to participate and help the auditors performing their task.

If something suspicious is found within the results of the audit which may impact the tax return, the authority might order a re-audit for more analysis.

The audited person has the right to ask for the notification copy and connected documents and be present throughout the auditing procedures that are conducted outside of the official places.

In March 2021, FTA said that influencers on social media in the UAE or any users using online promotional activities should register for VAT and pay taxes if the value of the services they provide is more than AED375,000 in a 12-month period.


### VAT refunds for tourists

Foreign tourists visiting the UAE are entitled to VAT refunds for purchases of items being exported with the traveller on their departure. The refund only applied to items that have not been used in the UAE.
