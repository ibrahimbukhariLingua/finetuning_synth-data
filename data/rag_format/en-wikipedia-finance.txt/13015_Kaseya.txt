# Kaseya



**Kaseya Limited** (/kəˈseɪ.ə/ kə-SAY-ə) is a company headquartered in Miami that develops software for network monitoring, system monitoring, and other information technology applications. It is majority-owned by Insight Partners and owns the naming rights to the Kaseya Center. The company was estimated to be valued at $12 billion in April 2023.


## History

Kaseya was founded in 2000 in California by Mark Sutherland and Paul Wong, who previously worked together on a project for the National Security Agency.

In 2003, Gerald Blackie joined the company as its CEO.

In June 2013, Insight Partners acquired control of the company and Yogesh Gupta became CEO.

In July 2015, Fred Voccola was named CEO of the company.

In 2018, the company moved its headquarters from Boston to Brickell, Miami.

In April 2023, the company acquired the naming rights to the Kaseya Center in a 17-year, $117.4 million agreement.

In 2024, the company laid off 150 employees, about 8% of its Miami workforce. The company stated that it was part of its normal performance-based reviews and that the jobs would not disappear.


### Security Issues

In 2015, Kaseya fixed a directory traversal vulnerability in their remote access tool. The same bug was present in the company's support website for a further six years.

In 2018, the company's remote tool was infiltrated and hackers were able to commandeer affected computers to mine cryptocurrency.

In July 2021, the Kaseya VSA ransomware attack, perpetrated by REvil, led to downtime for 60 customers and over 1,500 downstream businesses.


### Business practices

Kaseya faced backlash in 2022, when customers found that terms and conditions were being updated to introduce automatically renewing three-year terms, getting only a 30 days notice of the change.
