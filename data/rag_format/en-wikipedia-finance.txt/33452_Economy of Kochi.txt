All the units operate within a radius of 15 km.The industry has started growing here over the past two decades. Initially, there were only 10 companies. But later, as more people entered the sector and set up more units, the business picked up. The industry witnessed a major change when rubber wood became available in abundance due to fluctuations in rubber prices. The plywood is also imported from foreign countries like Vietnam, Loas and China. some more Eucalyptus timber is also imported from countries like Brazil. There is no market for plywood in Kerala.

The crisis that hit the construction industry during the period from 2003 to 2004 led to a large influx of migrant workers into the plywood industry.

## History


### Prehistoric to Chera period

Cochin was preceded by the Vempalinad fiefdom, which was part of the Kulasekhara empire.


### Independent period

Cochin became independent of the Kulasekhara empire in 1102 AD. It gained prominence as a trading port after the destruction of Muziris in 1341. It attracted Arab, Chinese and European maritime traders. Chinese fishing nets have been in use by the Cochinite fishing industry since 1350.


### Portuguese period

Portuguese traders built a factory in Cochin after obtaining permission from the Cochinite government in 1500. In return for defending Cochin against invasion by Calicut in 1503, Portugal was permitted to establish a military base in Cochin, and built Fort Emmanuel at the site of what is now Fort Kochi. Cochin became the capital of the newly formed Portuguese India, and the kingdom became a puppet state of Portugal.


### Dutch period

In 1662, the Dutch Republic launched an invasion of Cochin during a succession crisis, and completed it by February 1663. The Cochinite king, Rama Varma II (1658–1662) of the Tanur branch, was killed in battle, his successor Goda Varma was deposed, and the Dutch-backed pretender, Vīra Kērala Varma V of the Mutha Tavazhi branch, was installed as the new Raja of Cochin. The Portuguese traders and colonists were expelled from Cochin. On 20 March 1663, Dutch East India Company and the Raja of Cochin signed a treaty under which the company had a monopoly on purchasing on pepper and cinnamon produced in the kingdom. Another treaty in the following year exempted the company from the payment of import taxes. Further treaties eroded the power of the government and turned the kingdom into a puppet state of the company. Bolgatty Palace was built by Dutch traders after the Dutch conquest of Cochin.


### Mysorean period

After the Mysorean invasion of Cochin, the government of Cochin had to pay a one-off tribute of 1 lakh Ikkeri pagodas, and an annual tribute of 30,000 pagodas and four elephants to Mysore.


### British period

Trade in at port increased substantially after the British Empire took control of Cochin. To develop Cochin port, Robert Bristow was brought to Cochin in 1920 by Lord Willingdon, Governor of Madras.


### Present period

In the early 2000s, the city witnessed heavy investment, and experienced a GDP growth rate of 8.3%.
