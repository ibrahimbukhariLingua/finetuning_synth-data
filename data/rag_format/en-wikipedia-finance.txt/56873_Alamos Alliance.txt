# Alamos Alliance



The **Alamos Alliance** is a lobbying organization consisting of a group of conservative economists linked to the Chicago Boys, which holds a three-day annual meeting, usually by mid-February, in a town named Álamos, in the Mexican state of Sonora, in northwestern Mexico.


## History

This organization, founded by Arnold Harberger in 1993, is mostly known for its neoliberal points of view and its impulse to business-friendly conditions and environments favorable to investments and development of the free-enterprise system.

Its first meeting was held in February 1994 at the Hotel de los Tesoros, in Álamos ("Poplars").

For the first time, the XXVIII Alamos Alliance conference was held online, on 30 April 2021. Participants and guests joined from all over the world through a virtual platform, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Murphy, professor in economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; former Texas Senator Phil Gramm; economist Anne Krueger; Manuel Suárez Mier; Pedro Aspe, former Mexican Secretary of Finance and Public Credit; Mexican economist Manuel Sánchez; economist Tom Saving, and Chilean economist Sebastián Edwards.

The XXIX Meeting, with the title *Stability, Growth, and Radical Uncertainty: Assessing Options and Opportunities*, was held in San Antonio, Texas, on 10–13 March 2022.
