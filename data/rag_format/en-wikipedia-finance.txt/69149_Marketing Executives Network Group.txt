### Structure

The organization consists of a governance board of directors and currently has fourteen (14) local chapters in major cities in the continental United States. Local chapters provide a regional and local forum and opportunity for members to meet, engage and network with other executive-level marketing professionals. A web based forum also provides an exchange point for special interest groups to discuss category-specific news and exchange ideas. Newer forms of social media are also utilized including LinkedIn (with over 1200 members) and Twitter


### Service

Members contribute to their industries through textbooks and other books they have authored and white papers as well. The group also provides outreach through a distinguished lecturer series program and speakers bureau on a variety of marketing topics. A comprehensive online training program in the form of The MENG Webinar Series is offered.

### Leadership

Members elect the National Board of Directors every year, including the National Chairman - Richard Guha (2001-2007), Richard Sellers (2007-2011) and Joey Iazzetto (2011-present). Individual chapters each nominate their own Chapter Chair and local leadership.


### Research and Education

The organization is perhaps best known for its research including the annual Marketing Trends Survey which captures marketing leaders' perspectives on the coming year and published in leading marketing trade journals such as Crain Communications' Advertising Age and BtoBonline.com. This survey has been produced and published by MENG, along with Anderson Analytics since 2007. Its findings are often cited as references in digital media and print.

The group also partners with others on topics and factors affecting the marketing profession including employment prospects, job satisfaction and executive compensation. The Economist (print and online). Pace University, and PM Network (the monthly magazine of the Project Management Institute) referenced MENG research and its leadership position in the area of augmenting and accelerating traditional market research with a new methodology called open innovation and crowdsourcing.


### Honors and awards

The organization is the official marketing partner of the 2009 Edison Best New Product Awards for innovation and advancement in products and services. The first recipients under the new partnership were awarded on 1 April 2009 in a variety of categories and industries.
