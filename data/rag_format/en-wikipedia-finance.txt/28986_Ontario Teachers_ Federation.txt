Ontario Teachers' Federation


# Ontario Teachers' Federation



The **Ontario Teachers' Federation** (**OTF**; French: *Fédération des enseignantes et des enseignants de l'Ontario*, FEO) is the professional body representing over 160,000 teachers in Ontario's publicly funded schools. It operates the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTTP), which in 2021, was Canada's largest single-profession pension plan, with around $200 billion in managed assets. OTF was established by the Teaching Profession Act of 1944. The four Ontario teacher federations are OTF affiliates: the Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO), the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO); the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA); and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF). All teachers in Ontario's publicly funded schools belong to one of the affiliates and to OTF.


## History

OTF was established by the Teaching Profession Act of 1944.

In 1997, the organization saw thousands of teachers and supporters on the front lawn of the Ontario Legislature in Toronto for a strike.

The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan lost $19 billion in 2008.

Between 2008 and 2009, net assets fell to $87.4 billion from $108.5 billion.

In May 2016, CBC reported that the Ontario government since 2000 had given "$80.5 million to teachers' unions and the Ontario Teachers' Federation," after Ontario's auditor general performed an investigation.

In 2018, there were five teachers' unions that comprised the Ontario Teachers' Federation (OTF), at which point it was described as a union representing around 160,000 public school teachers.

In 2020, it invested in the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. In December 2020, it invested in Società Gasdotti Italia S.P.A., acquiring a controlling stake. In 2021, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan increased its stake in the Scotia Gas Networks (SGN). At the time, the OTPP was Canada's largest single-profession pension plan, with around $200 billion in assets it managed. In January 2022, the OTF came to an agreement with education minister Stephen Leccee to allow retired teachers to be re-employed for 95 days instead of 50, to help deal with returning to school.
