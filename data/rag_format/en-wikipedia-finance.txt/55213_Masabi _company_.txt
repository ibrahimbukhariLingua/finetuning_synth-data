**Masabi Ltd.** is a British technology company that develops and markets fare collection services for public transport systems. The company offers mobile ticketing apps, smart cards, and other fare media for electronic fare collection, allowing users to buy tickets by app, on the web, at kiosks, and retail locations, and allowing tickets to be read by an electronic reader or scanned by a rail conductor by mobile phone.

In April 2019, the company reported that it was on track to exceed US$1 billion in annual ticketing sales in the next year. It is currently located in offices in Tech City, London and in New York and Boston in the USA.

In 2020, Masabi's Justride SDK was recognized as Ticketing Technology of the Year at the Transport Ticketing Global Awards 2020.
