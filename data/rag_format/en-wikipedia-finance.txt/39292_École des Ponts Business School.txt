## History

Established as ENPC School of International Management in 1987 by Celia Russo in 1987 to promote the study of international business and value-based global leadership. It later changed its name to École des Ponts Business School.

Celia Russo, was selected in 1980 by Jacques Tanzi – the then recently appointed Director of Ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées – to set up the Department of Languages and International Culture. Her appointment as a foreigner and as a woman, who was not an engineer, in a wholly French, male-dominated establishment caused an uproar among the school's Board of Governors. Seven years later, the Board ultimately decided unanimously to implement the business school Celia Russo designed and to support the degree that went with it and to appoint Celia to run it as the Dean. Celia Russo became the first Dean of École des Ponts Business School from 1987 until her death in 1999. She was also a recipient of the *Vermeil Medal Society Encouragement au Progres* in 1990, and was awarded the *Chevalier de l'Ordre du Mérite* from the President of France in 1997 - this award is the second highest given by the French Republic to honor people of distinguished merit.

Michel Fender, a Professor of Logistics and Supply Chain Management, succeeded Russo as Dean and worked in that position until 2001. Michel Fender and Tawfik Jelassi were assigned as co-Deans in 2001 until 2004 and in 2004, Tawfik Jelassi was named Dean. In 2014, Professor Alon Rozen was named Dean and is the current Dean and Professor of Innovation Management.


## Grande École System

École des Ponts is a *Grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, *Grandes Écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Although they are more expensive than public universities in France, *Grandes Écoles* typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the *Grandes Écoles*. Many of the top ranked business schools in Europe are members of the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* *(CGE)*, as is École des Ponts Business School, and out of the 250 business schools in France, only 39 are *CGE* members.

Degrees from École des Ponts are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (French: *Le Ministère de L'éducation Nationale*). École des Ponts is further accredited by the elite international business school accrediting organizations and it holds double accreditation: The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), and Association of MBAs (AMBA)
