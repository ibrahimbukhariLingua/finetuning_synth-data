It was later established that Dalmia was in the United States from 2003 to 2006 trying to perpetuate fraud in computer equipment leasing market by setting up businesses using fake names and deals purportedly money laundering. He was constantly seen in the New Brunswick area of New Jersey driving luxury cars and often eating at Udipi Cafe.
