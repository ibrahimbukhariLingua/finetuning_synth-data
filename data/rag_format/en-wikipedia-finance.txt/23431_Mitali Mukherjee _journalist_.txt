### Book

Mukherjee wrote a book titled *Crypto Crimes* in 2024 which was published by Harper Collins. While reviewing her book for *News18,* columnist Harshil Mehta observed that the book "gives a feel of a reporter’s diary or some journalistic assignment. Many stories could have been kept short, and others presented in a more engaging manner. The author’s lack of deep expertise is evident in the frequent reliance on quotes and news reports, even for basic information, which disrupts the flow of the narrative."
