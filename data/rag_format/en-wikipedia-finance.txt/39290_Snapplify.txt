In 2015, South African venture capital firm AngelHub, backed by former First National Bank CEO Michael Jordaan and RMB co-founder Paul Harris’ family, announced that it had invested in Snapplify. In 2016, Snapplify raised expansion capital from existing funder AngelHub Ventures, as well as new backers from South Africa and the UK to enable the company's continued growth into new markets in Africa.

In 2019, Snapplify secured $2 million expansion capital from venture capital firm Knife Capital, and empowered African investment manager Hlayisani Capital's Hlayisani Growth Fund. In early 2019, Snapplify released basic Engage – a free version of their Engage e-learning platform. In 2020, Snapplify acquired Onnie Media, an educator media hub for SA teachers, and the hub's online marketplace for teachers in South Africa, *Teacha!*
