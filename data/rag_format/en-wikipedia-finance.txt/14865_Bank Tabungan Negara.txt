# Bank Tabungan Negara



**PT Bank Tabungan Negara (Persero) Tbk**, lit. "National (State) Savings Bank", abbreviated and trading as **BTN** (currently stylized in its logo in all-lowercase), is an Indonesian commercial bank best known as a mortgage bank, headquartered in Gambir, Jakarta.

Founded in 1897 by the government of the Dutch East Indies as a post office savings bank, its products include banks accounts (savings, current, and fixed deposit), loans (personal, business, and mortgage loans—the latter being its most popular offering since its introduction in the 1970s) and Sharia-compliant banking services.


## History

Bank Tabungan Negara was established in 1897 as a postal savings bank under the name **Postspaarbank**, with its headquarters located in Batavia. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the bank was frozen and replaced with the **Savings Office** (Japanese: 貯金局, Hepburn: *Chokin-kyoku*, Nihon-shiki: *Tyokin-kyoku*) After the proclamation of Indonesian independence, the bank was taken over by the Indonesian government on 9 February 1950 under the Emergency Law No.9 and renamed **Bank Tabungan Pos** (Postal Savings Bank). In 1963 the bank's current name, Bank Tabungan Negara, was adopted. Bank BTN became the first bank to be appointed by the government to provide housing finance and mortgages to lower and middle income individuals.

The bank underwent a corporate restructure in 2003, which was followed by an initial public offering (IPO) in 2009 that led to the listing of Bank BTN on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The IPO was ranked as Indonesia's largest IPO as of 2009.


## Logo history
