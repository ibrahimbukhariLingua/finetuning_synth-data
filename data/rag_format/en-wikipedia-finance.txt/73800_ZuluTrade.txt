## Service

The ZuluTrade service is a social and copy trading online platform that allows users to mimic the investing strategies of trading "experts" in forex markets. The user base is typically split into two categories: signal providers and followers. Signal providers are generally traders that have developed a strategy willing to share and can be copied by their followers. Followers can also mimic strategies of the portfolios created by other followers. Signal provider compensation fees are based on the success and popularity of their trading strategies.

The platform also has several features, including ZuluGuard, that automatically unfollows a signal provider if their trading strategies change. Lock Trade allows users to verify the execution of a trade after the signal has been received. The website also features several social network-like features including comments and forums. The platform also has a feature called ZuluScript which allows users to create scripts that designate specific parameters as criteria for trading robots (known as "Expert Advisors") to automatically start making trades. Additionally, ZuluTrade operates a binary option social trading platform.

ZuluTrade provides rankings of investor performance and allow investors to immediately observe and copy other trader's portfolios. This is provided by simulator which shows overall profit, alerts user if a margin call occurred and even allows user to download a spreadsheet of all the simulated trades.
