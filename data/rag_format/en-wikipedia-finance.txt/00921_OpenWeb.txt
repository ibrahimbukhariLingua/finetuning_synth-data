## History

The company was founded in 2015 as Spot.IM by Israeli software architects Nadav Shoval and Ishay Green. Roee Goldberg joined as Co-Founder and COO in 2014.

In 2016, Spot.IM raised $13 million from Index Ventures and AltaIR Capital, along with other notable technology investors, in a Series A round.

In 2017, co-founder and CEO, Nadav Shoval, was inducted into the second annual Forbes Israel 30 Under 30 list. In addition, the company finalized its Series C investment round of $25M, led by New York City-based fund - Insight Partners, Altair VC, and more.

In 2019, Spot.IM raised $25 million in Series D funding. The new funding was led by previous investor Insight Partners along with Norma Investments, AltaIR Capital, Cerca and WGI Group.

In 2020, the company was renamed OpenWeb.

In November 2021, OpenWeb raised a $150M Series E financing round which included investment from Insight Partners, Georgian, The New York Times Company, Samsung Next, Dentsu Ventures, Harel, Entr√©e Capital, Omer Cygler, and Scott Galloway. This round of investment pushed the company's valuation over $1 billion. In November 2022, OpenWeb announced a Series F round of funding at $170M, valuing the company at over $1.5 billion.

In September 2024 Nadav Shoval was replaced by Tim Harvey as CEO, purportedly after a disagreement over a potential investment from BlackRock. Nadav Shoval refused to step down as CEO, but he was removed from OpenWeb's leadership page. Shoval attempted to be reinstated as CEO by filing an injunction with an Israeli court, however he was unsuccessful.

In February 2025, Nadal Shoval was allowed to return to OpenWeb as an advisor to the CEO.
