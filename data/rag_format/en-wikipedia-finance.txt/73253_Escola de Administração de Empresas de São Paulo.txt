# Escola de Administração de Empresas de São Paulo



The **Escola de Administração de Empresas de São Paulo da Fundação Getulio Vargas (EAESP FGV)** (Fundação Getulio Vargas's São Paulo School of Business Administration) is a Brazilian private higher education institution founded in 1954 as the result of joint efforts of the Brazilian government and business community with the objective to provide people with the skills needed to tackle the challenges Brazil was going through.

The school was established with the help of Michigan State University professors in the assembly of its academic system. In partnerships with some Brazilians companies and governmental bodies, EAESP maintains 20 studies and research center and a Junior Enterprise, Empresa Júnior FGV, the first one in Latin America. Among other degrees, EAESP offers four-year bachelor's degrees in business and public administration, MBA, MPA and other master's degrees, as well as doctoral programs.

In 2000, EAESP's undergraduate and graduate Administration programs were accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). One year later, in 2001, its learning activities were again accredited with another international accreditation: European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS). In 2004, two of EAESP's courses were accredited by Association of MBAs (AMBA). EAESP is one of South American universities with these three accreditations.


## Research and Publications Center ("Núcleo de Pesquisas e Publicações" – NPP)

EAESP's Research and Publications Center − GVpesquisa − contains material for further research in the topics of Administration and related areas, such as Economics, Information Technology, Sociology and Psychology. Its Business Administration Reviews include RAE, GV-Executivo and RAE-eletrônica.

RAE, published since 1961, is written and published by a team of authors made up of faculty and students from EAESP and other institutions. In addition to RAE, EAESP has published, since 2002, GV-executivo, with a focus on business administration.

Together with Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, Keio Business School in Tokyo, the School of Management of Fudan University in Shanghai, ESSEC Business School in France and Singapore, and the University of Mannheim in Germany, EAESP forged an alliance of leading business schools from all parts of the world in 2010 called "Council on Business and Society". The Council on Business & Society convenes a biennial forum that combines the expertise of faculty members from each of the partner schools with that of representatives of business, government, and non-governmental organizations from around the world. The inaugural forum, held in Paris in November 2012, focused on Corporate Governance and Leadership. The 2014 forum was hosted by Keio Business School in Tokyo and focused on Health Care Delivery. The next edition will be hosted by Dartmouth in Boston and will focus on energy and environment
