## History

The Caesarstone factory commenced its operations in 1987, at Kibbutz Sdot Yam, replacing its terrazzo tile factory. The company was established in the wake of development work performed jointly by members of the kibbutz and additional parties such as Professor Moshe Narkis of the Technion. After changing the focus from sale of floor tiles to quartz surfaces and establishing itself in the domestic market, the company started to export its products to different countries around the world. In 2005, an additional production facility was opened at the Bar-Lev Industrial Park. In 2006, TENE Investment Fund invested 25 million dollars in exchange for 21.7% control in the company, which led to the adding of another production line at the Bar-Lev facility.

In 2008, the company began establishing subsidiaries in its main markets: Australia (2008), Canada (2010), USA and Singapore (2011) and UK (2017) along with activity conducted through distributors in approximately 50 countries.

In 2012, Caesarstone started trading on NASDAQ in New York under the ticker symbol CSTE.

In 2015, Caesarstone opened a new facility in the US with an investment of about 100 million dollars. The plant was built in Richmond Hill, Georgia, and provides quartz surfaces mainly to markets in North America, and other countries as well.

On 1 July 2024, Australia banned the use, supply and manufacture of engineered stone. Due to the high crystalline silica in the dust created when working with engineered stone exposure can result in severe health risks.


## Products

The company's products are marketed in four collections:

* Classico – the classic collection in a variety of colors.
* Supernatural – design inspired by natural stone.
* Motivo – surfaces with imprinted textures in various design templates.
* Concetto – surfaces made from semi-precious gems cut and set manually.

Quartz surfaces are claimed to require only minimum maintenance and not to require periodic sealing as with natural stone surfaces.

In the US, quartz counter tops can be found in homes and kitchens such as Tommy Hilfiger, Cher, Alexandra von Furstenberg, and more.

## 2012 Nasdaq IPO

In February 2012, Caesarstone filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to execute an initial public offering of up to $115 million and list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Among the companies involved in the IPO were J.P. Morgan, Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Baird. Caesarstone's 6.7 million shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on 22 March and priced at $11 each.

In 2015–2016, Caesarstone encountered challenges which included discord between shareholders and kibbutz members, departure of board members and CEO, and a report by Spruce Point hedge fund claiming that the company's quartz surfaces contain less than the commonly accepted amounts of quartz, and yet are still sold at premium prices. In 2016 the share price declined compared to its former peak, however in H1 2017, Caesarstone shares climbed 23 percent; thus, Caesarstone's value stands at 1.49 billion dollars.


## 2023 Caesarstone Australian Ad Controversy

In late October 2023, Caesarstone has launched an Australian ad campaign to oppose a ban on the product, which is linked to silicosis, a deadly lung disease. The ad claims that banning the product will harm workers and consumers.
Trade unions and politicians have condemned the ad as a “disgrace” and a “misinformation” campaign, and have compared Caesarstone to James Hardie, the company notorious for its asbestos liabilities. Trade unions have also marched to the NSW Parliament to demand a ban on engineered stone. Federal and state work safety and health ministers will meet on Friday (27 October 2023) to discuss a secret report that reportedly recommends a ban on engineered stone, dubbed the new asbestos. Caesarstone is pushing for a ban only on products with more than 40 per cent silica content.
