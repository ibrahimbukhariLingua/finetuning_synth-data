KEDGE Business School


# KEDGE Business School



**KEDGE Business School** is a triple accredited (AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA) French business school and grande école. The Grande Ecole was founded in 2013 from the merger of two middle business schools: Bordeaux Ecole de Management (ESC Bordeaux), founded in 1874 in Bordeaux; and EUROMED Management in Marseilles (ESC Marseille), founded in 1872 in Marseille.

## Grande école degrees

KEDGE Business School is a *grande école*, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. *Grandes écoles* are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France.

The degrees are accredited by the *Conférence des Grandes Écoles* and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the *Licence* / Bachelor's degrees, and the Master's and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various "parcours" or paths based on UE (Unités d'enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Bachelors is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (Grand Ecole Program) ends with the degree of Master's in Management (MiM)

## Campus extension

In 2018, the expansion project in the Luminy campus (in the Adhesion Zone of the Calanques Natural park) is still controversial, with plans to modify 11,000 square meters of nature. According to critics, around 600 centennial trees will be cut down while the director of school says the old trees will be preserved.
