## History


### Navistar Defense LLC (2003â€“present)

In October 2003, Navistar CEO Dan Ustian announced the company would be forming a defense business unit in order to sell military vehicles. Navistar Defense would be led by Archie Massicotte, a 26-year veteran of the company. Ustian stated "This is a natural area of growth for International. We already have all the platforms that the U.S. military and other NATO countries could leverage for products and services."

In 2007, Navistar's International Truck and Engine Corporation became the first company to enter hybrid commercial truck production, with the International DuraStar Hybrid diesel-electric truck.

Navistar Defense LLC is the prime supplier of MRAP armored vehicles to the US military. The Navistar 7000 series has been fielded by the Canadian Forces for domestic operations. In 2005, the U.S. Army ordered 2,900 7000-MVs for the Afghan National Army and Iraqi Ministry of Defense and an additional order of 7,000 was added in 2008.

Navistar Defense also has a small Canadian branch, named Navistar Defence Canada.

Navistar Defense reported sales of $3.9 billion in 2008 and $2.8 billion in 2009.

In October 2009, the company entered into a strategic agreement with Czech-based company Tatra to jointly develop, produce and market new military vehicles.

In December 2009, analysts were skeptical of the company's long-term potential. "Navistar came out of nowhere and became a big player with MRAP, in what was a short-term program," said Dean Lockwood, an analyst at Forecast International Inc., a Connecticut-based defense consultant. "They didn't prove themselves to be a long-term major player."

In 2010, Navistar Defense's sales were $1.8 billion. The company's 2010 Annual 10K report stated "we continue to expect that over the long term our military business will generate approximately $1.5
billion to $2 billion in annual sales."

In 2011, Navistar Defense's sales were $2.0 billion.

In 2012, Navistar Defense reported $1.0 billion in sales. Business Insider ranked Navistar Defense at 22 in the top 25 US defense companies.

In 2013, Navistar Defense reported $543 million in sales. In the company's 10K filing, they projected military sales to continue to decline, citing U.S. budgetary constraints.

In 2014, Navistar Defense reported $149 million in sales. The company projected 2015 military sales to be slightly higher due to recent contract awards relating to the government's MRAP fleet.

In 2015, Navistar Defense reported $203 million in sales. The 2015 military sales primarily consisted of refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles to "like new" condition, upgrade kits, spare parts, and technical support services. The company projected 2016 sales to be slightly higher than 2015 due to a recent new vehicle contract award, additional refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles and technical support services.

In 2016's annual report, Navistar Defense reported $198 million in sales. The 2016 military sales primarily consisted of deliveries of MILCOT variants to foreign militaries, refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles to "like new" condition, upgrade kits, spare parts, and technical support services. In 2017, ND said they expect their U.S. military sales to be consistent with 2016 as their contract backlog consists of a similar mix of products as that of 2016.


#### Subpoena from U.S. DOD Inspector General

In third-quarter 2016, Navistar Defense said it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Defense Inspector General asking for documents related to the sale of some independent suspension systems to the government. Navistar Defense said it would comply. The subpoena is related to the independent suspension systems sold for military vehicles between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2010. On June 3, 2016, ND met with government representatives, including representatives from DOD IG and the U.S. Department of Justice, to discuss the matter. ND made submissions of documents responsive to the subpoena in June and August 2016 and has substantially completed its subpoena response.

#### 2014

In January 2014, the Pentagon announced they had notified allies of their intent to give away or scrap 13,000 used MRAPs.

In September 2014, amidst numerous divestitures, Navistar Inc. CEO Troy Clark gave Navistar Defense a vote of confidence, noting that the military business unit would be retained.
