## Synopsis

Tony's losing streak in sports betting continues. When Hesh asks him about repayment of his previous $200,000 bridge loan, Tony pretends to have forgotten about it and offers to pay the vig. Hesh was not charging interest and is insulted that Tony treats the loan as a mere business transaction. Tony calls Hesh a "shylock" in front of his crew. Later, Hesh says to his son-in-law, "At what point is it cheaper for him to settle it another way?"

Carmela sells the spec house, with its sub-standard materials, to her cousin Brian Cammarata and his pregnant wife. She tells Tony that she has cleared $600,000 and he assumes that half the profit is his. Tony wants to bet it on a "sure thing", but Carmela refuses and he yields to her. The "sure thing" wins, but he reveals to Carmela that he only had $10,000 to bet on it. This leads to a furious argument about money, during which he manhandles her and she throws a Lladró figurine at him, breaking it. Later, the couple reconciles after Tony agrees to control his gambling. Carmela is worried about the many threats they are facing; Tony says he survived being shot: "Big picture-wise, I'm up, way up."

Vito's widow, Marie, asks Tony to help her son, Vito Jr., who has been deliberately misbehaving since his father's death. Marie requests $100,000 to move her family to Maine to start over; Tony is reluctant. Both he and Phil (Marie's second cousin) talk to Vito Jr., to no effect. When he is expelled for defecating in the school shower, Tony decides to pay for the relocation. However, he gambles away the $100,000 he had reserved for it. Instead, he offers Marie to send Vito Jr. to a boot camp program in Idaho. He plays down her worries about corporal punishment and says he will pay the $18,000 fee. Marie reluctantly accepts and Vito Jr. is taken away against his will by the boot camp's staff, leaving his mother and sister in tears.

Driving by, Tony happens to notice Ahmed and Muhammad mingling with traditionally dressed Pakistanis and Arabs on a street.

A.J. proposes to Blanca, who reluctantly accepts, but later breaks up with him.

Renata, Hesh's girlfriend, dies suddenly. He is grief-stricken. Tony visits him and speaks clichéd words of condolence. He presents a large paper bag, saying, "I brought your money."


## First appearance

* **Jason Gervasi**: Son of DiMeo capo Carlo Gervasi. He is seen greeting his father getting out of a car.

## Final appearances

"Chasing It" marks the final appearances in the series of these longtime recurring characters:

* **Hugh De Angelis** and **Mary De Angelis**: The parents of Carmela Soprano.

## Title reference

* The title refers to Tony's gambling addiction. "Chasing the vig" is common parlance in gambling vernacular for when one loses a bet(s) and then makes further wagers in order to either make up for the losses and/or keep up with any loan interest (the vig) accrued.

## Production

* Max Casella (Benny Fazio) is promoted to the main cast of the series and billed in the opening credits but only for this episode.
* The character of Vito Spatafore Jr. was recast for this episode with Brandon Hannan replacing Frank Borrelli.
* John Cenatiempo, a stuntman on *The Sopranos* since its first season, joins the ranks of the show's actors as well, appearing as a mostly background Soprano crime family mobster character Anthony Maffei, beginning with this episode.
* This episode is unique in that it almost throughout its entirety employs the shaky camera style, with the exception of Dr. Melfi's scenes and scenes in Tony's car. The style may represent the episode's theme of Tony's feverish gambling and losing spree.
* The casino scenes were filmed at Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel and Casino.
* The headstone that Vito Jr. knocks over in the cemetery is for "David M. Hackel". Episode writer Matthew Weiner worked for David Hackel as a writer for the sitcom *Becker*.
* The harmonica player in Sinatra's band is Southside Johnny Lyon, an underground legend of New Jersey's music scene. He has worked extensively with Little Steven Van Zandt, who portrays the character of Silvio Dante. Van Zandt has written, produced and performed on four of Lyon's albums and was a founding member of his band, the Asbury Jukes, before leaving to join Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. Both Springsteen and Van Zandt appear on the Asbury Jukes' *Better Days* album, on the song "It's Been a Long Time".
* The Tampa Bay-Buffalo football game being watched at the Bing that Tony loses money on is actually footage from the film *The Replacements*.

## Connections to prior episodes

* While Tony lectures Vito Jr., he tells him he "goes about in pity for himself", which was the phrase he became intrigued with while in the hospital, and the same thing he said to Artie Bucco in the Season 6, Part I episode "Luxury Lounge."
* "Johnny Boy" Soprano once, after he cut off Satriale's (who owed him money) finger, told Tony to never ever gamble for the debts could get a man into serious trouble. (A flashback in the Season 3 episode "Fortunate Son")
* Tony brings up to Carmela that she stole money from his bird feed stashes, which happened in the Season 4 episode "Mergers and Acquisitions."
* Tony also reminds her about his leaning on her spec house building inspector ("Kaisha").
* The ornament that Carmela throws at Tony and smashes against the wall is the Lladró figurine that she tells A.J. and his girlfriend is worth $3,000 in the Season 4 episode "Everybody Hurts".
* Tony tries to give Hesh a cap from *Cleaver*, which was Christopher's movie from "Stage 5".
* Hesh has to drop Eli off at physical therapy; he was badly beaten in "Members Only."
