# Julius Baer



**Julius Baer** (né **Isaac Baer**; born 2 January 1857 – 9 March 1922) was a Grand Duchy of Baden-born Swiss banker, businessman and philanthropist. Baer was the founder and namesake of Julius Baer Group, and the patriarch of the Baer family.


## Early life and education

Baer was born in Heidelsheim (today part of Bruchsal), Grand Duchy of Baden to Joseph (1816–1891) and Rosina (née Dreyfuss; 1819–1907) Baer, into a Jewish family. His father worked as private money lender and merchant of animal skins, while his mother was a homemaker. He was the second youngest of five siblings. Baer was educated at the Jewish School of Heidelsheim and completed a banking apprenticeship at *Bankhaus August Gerstle* in Augsburg from 1883 to 1885.


## Career

In 1886, he became a partner in the private bank *Samuel Dukas & Co.* in Basel, Switzerland. A position he continued to hold until 1896, when he was deployed by his brother-in-law Ludwig Hirschhorn, to Zurich. He became a partner in *Bank Hirschhorn, Uhl & Bär*, which existed since 1890, and is the ultimate predecessor of today's Julius Baer Group. Since 1901, the bank bore only his name, and was known as *Julius Bär & Co.*, which became one of the leading Swiss private banks.

He was on several board of directors including Lake Thun railway line, Südostbahn and Oerlikon-Bührle (1908–1922).
