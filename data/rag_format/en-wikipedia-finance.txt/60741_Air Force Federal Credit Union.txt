## History

Soarion Credit Union (Soarion), formerly known as AFFCU, is a federal credit union that was founded in November 1952 by 10 airmen volunteers. In 1953, it was operating from a one-room office on Lackland Air Force Base. On April 2, 2024, AFFCU changed its name to Soarion Credit Union.

In 2006, Soarion joined the Co-op Financial Services, allowing access to over 30,000 ATMs for no surcharge. In the summer of the following year, Soarion joined the Shared Branching Network. This gave further access to more than 5,400 branches and kiosks domestically and internationally. On January 8, 2024, Soarion ceased participation in the CO-OP ATM and Shared Branching networks. Instead, it emphasized its participation in the Allpoint ATM network.

On June 29, 2012, Soarion changed from a single common bond credit union to a multiple common bond credit union and granted eligibility to members of the Airman Heritage Foundation. In May 2018, Soarion merged with Local 142 Federal Credit Union, a single-office credit union that served members of several local unions. In 2019, the entity opened its first Financial Center outside the state of Texas in Columbus, Mississippi.

As of April 2024, the credit union had more an $663 million in assets, and over 54,000 members worldwide.
