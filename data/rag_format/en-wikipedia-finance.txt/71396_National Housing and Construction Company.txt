**National Housing and Construction Company Limited** (**NHCC**), is a Ugandan construction and real estate management company, partly owned by the Uganda Government. The Company’s mandate is to increase the housing stock in the country, rehabilitate the housing industry and encourage Ugandans to own homes in an organized environment.


## History

NHCC was established by the National Housing Corporation Act of 1964, as a government parastatal. The Act was repealed by the 1974 Decree to form the National Housing and Construction Corporation. In July 2002, the corporation became a public limited liability company known as the National Housing and Construction Company Limited. Later, the Uganda government partially divested from NHCC by selling 49 percent shareholding to the Libyan African Investment Company, an investment company owned by the government of Libya. or is it?
