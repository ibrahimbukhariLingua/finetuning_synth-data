In Canada, there are two types of sales taxes levied. These are :

* **Provincial sales taxes** or **PST** (French: *Taxes de vente provinciale - TVP*), levied by the provinces.
* **Goods and services tax** or **GST** (French: *Taxe sur les produits et services - TPS*) / **Harmonized sales tax** or **HST** (French: *Taxe de vente harmonisée - TVH*), a value-added tax levied by the federal government. The GST applies nationally. The HST includes the provincial portion of the sales tax but is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and is applied under the same legislation as the GST. The HST is in effect in Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

Every province except Alberta has implemented either a provincial sales tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax. The federal GST rate is 5 percent, effective January 1, 2008.

The territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have no territorial sales taxes, so only the GST is collected. The three northern jurisdictions are partially subsidized by the federal government, and their residents receive some additional tax concessions due to the high cost of living in the north.


## Provincial sales taxes

Separate **provincial sales taxes** (**PST**) are collected in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba (**retail sales tax** or **RST**) and Quebec (**Quebec sales tax** or **QST**, French: ***Taxe de vente du Québec*** or ***TVQ***). Prince Edward Island switched to a HST on April 1, 2013, the same date that British Columbia reverted to a separate GST/PST after their adoption of a HST in 2000 was rejected in a referendum. Goods to which the tax is applied vary by province, as does the rate. In all provinces where the provincial sales tax is collected, the tax is imposed on the sale price without GST (in the past, in Quebec and in Prince Edward Island, PST was applied to the combined sum of sale price and GST). Of the provincial sales taxes, only the QST (and the HST) are value-added; the rest are cascading taxes.

| Province | Type | Prov. rate (%) | Total tax rate (%) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alberta | GST | 0 | 5 | There is a 9% tax on lodging and 4% tax on hotel room fees. |
| British Columbia | GST + PST | 7 | 12 | Reverted to a separate GST/PST on April 1, 2013, with a PST of 7%, after their adoption of a HST in 2010 was rejected in a referendum. |
| Manitoba | GST + RST | 7 | 12 | The RST was increased one point to 8% on July 1, 2013. It reverted to 7% as of July 1, 2019 and although it was planned to drop to 6% as of July 1, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic the province has deferred the reduction until further notice. There is a 5% tax on lodging and 5% tax on hotel room fees. |
| New Brunswick | **HST** | 10 | 15 | The HST was increased two points to 10% with an overall tax of 15% on July 1, 2016. |

| Northwest Territories | GST | 0 | 5 |
| Nova Scotia | **HST** | 10 | 15 | Rates were meant to be reduced to 14 and 13% on July 1, 2014 and July 1, 2015 respectively. However, the government has stated that the province cannot afford reductions. |
| Nunavut | GST | 0 | 5 |
| Ontario | **HST** | 8 | 13 |
| Prince Edward Island | **HST** | 10 | 15 | The HST was increased one point to 15% on October 1, 2016. |

| Saskatchewan | GST + PST | 6 | 11 | The 6% rate is effective for goods and services effective March 23, 2017. Effective April 1, 2017, New Homes, restaurant meals and other prepared food and beverages are subject to PST. There is a separate 10% liquor consumption tax. PST is not applicable for any exempt business in Lloydminster. |
| Yukon | GST | 0 | 5 |


## New housing rebate

Sales taxes on new or significantly renovated housing used as a primary residence may be eligible to have a portion of charged federal and provincial sales taxes rebated. New homes valued up to $450,000 may be eligible for a 36% rebate on GST charged up to a maximum of $6,300. Provincial sales tax rebate programs on new housing are offered in Ontario, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, and Quebec (for QST). Terms and conditions vary by province.
