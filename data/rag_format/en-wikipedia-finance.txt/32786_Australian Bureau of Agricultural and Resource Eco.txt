Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics


# Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics



The **Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences** (**ABARES**) is a federal research branch of the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, located in Canberra, Australia. ABARES was established on 21 August 1945 as the **Bureau of Agricultural Economics** (BAE), and is also involved in commercial consultancy. It was merged with the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) in 2010. The main role of ABARES is to provide "professionally independent data, research, analysis and advice that informs public and private decisions affecting Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry". ABARES maintains the AgSurf database which includes farm survey data on farm performance, production benchmarks, farm management, socioeconomic indicators relating to the grains, beef, sheep and dairy industries in Australia. ABARES has received funding from business and industry groups. ABARES' website notes that "Over half of ABARES' external revenue is derived from commercial consulting work."


## History

ABARES was founded on the 21st of August 1945 as the **Bureau of Agricultural Economics** (**BAE**) with the preliminary purpose of researching the economic potential of primary industries and their efficiency. Initially, the bureau was established to operate within the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction and was then transferred into the **Ministry for Commerce and Agriculture** in August 1946. In 1988, the bureau combined with the Bureau of Mineral Resources to become the **Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics** (**ABARE**) which would further widen the field of research to include energy, minerals markets and issues such as climate change. In 2010, ABARE undertook a further merger with the **Bureau of Rural Sciences** (**BRS**) with the goal to grant ABARES the capacity to undertake integrated economic, scientific and social science research.
In 1952, the bureau began to undertake frequent review and forecasts of farm survey data. Formal and regular assessments including a wider variety of productivity indicators of Australian agriculture began in the 1980s.

ABARES is under the direct leadership of several federal Ministers which include:

ABARES Federal Ministers
| Department | Minister |
| --- | --- |
| **Minister for Agriculture, Drought, and Emergency Management** | *Hon David Littleproud – MP* |
| **Minister for the Environment** | *Hon Susan Ley – MP* |

In 1948, ABARES had 25 professional staff with university degrees in economics or agricultural economics, and this number grew to 55 in 1954 than to 85 in 1962. During the 1970s ABARES' employee count had risen to 200 with special qualifications in economics. In the 1980s when the then ABARE merged with the Bureau of Mineral Resources to become ABARES, the total employee count peaked at just above 300, from the 1980s the employee count of ABARES declined to roughly 125 employees as of 2017–18.


## Data Collection, Processes and Procedures

ABARES collects a broad range of commodity, climate and agricultural data. The data ABARES collects is the chief source of publicly available data for Australian agricultural and resource economics related commodities and industries, and has been described as more accurate in these fields than other organisations. ABARES' surveys are sometimes collected via face-to-face interviews. Compared with other national agricultural and resource economics data collection agencies, ABARES is considered one of the more reliable and thorough. While ABARES does collate and produce reports exclusively within ABARES, often, ABARES will co-produce reports and documents with industry groups. By working collaboratively, the advice ABARES and the private entity provide will be received more effectively than information provided solely by ABARES or a private entity.

ABARES collates three annual agricultural surveys which includes:

The Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industry Survey (AAGIS) is a large report compiled by ABARES which assesses broadacre industries on a yearly basis. ABARES determines the target number and types of farms to include in the AAGIS survey. To do this, ABARES collects data on farms that participated in the survey in the previous year (and would like to participate in the current year) and then resample the remaining population to reach the target number and composition. Furthermore, the data collected within the AAGIS survey is split into various zones as to aid consistent data interpretation.

The ADI survey covers farms that are engaged in dairying. Australia's Dairy industry is the third largest rural industry behind wheat and beef and has a gross value of $4 billion.

The Murray-Darling Basin Irrigation Survey covers a broad range of industries and subindustries. The gross revenue from agriculture in the basin was $13.6 billion in 2000–01, of which $4.6 billion was estimated to be derived from irrigation. Irrigated agriculture is practiced on about 15 000 different farming properties throughout the Basin. The three main industries in this survey include Broadacre, Dairy and Horticulture. These are then subdivided into smaller industries to survey data on sheep farming, beef farming, grain growing, rice growing, cotton growing, dairy cattle farming, vegetable growing under cover and outdoors, grape, apple and pear, stone fruit, citrus fruit and other fruit and tree nut growing.

ABARES additionally collaborates with many other Australian government agencies to collect data on specific industries that may overlap with the other agency.

| Collaboration name | Agencies involved | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Farm-Level Agricultural Dataset (FLAD)** | ABS, DAWE and ABARES | In 2019–20, the partnership was undertaken to improve understanding of how drought and climate variability are impacting Australian Farm production. FLAD will enable analysis of changes in agricultural production over time for a wider range of researchers. More broadly, the methods used to incorporate location information will pave the way for understanding how businesses of all types are impacted by a range of nearby physical environment variables e.g. temperature, air quality, or urban infrastructure. |
| **Physical Environment Analysis Network (PEAN)** | DAWE, ABARES, ABS, **Bureau of Meteorology**, **CSIRO** and **Geoscience Australia** | PEAN was established in 2017 under the Data Integration Partnership for Australia (DIPA). The main objective of PEAN is to increase the value of the government's scientific and administrative data on the physical environment, agriculture, energy, biodiversity, and on supporting Indigenous aspirations. |
| **National Agricultural Statistics Review (NASR)** | ABS and ABARES | NASR was established in 2013 with the objective to consider all aspects of the national agricultural statistical information system and assess its ability to inform decision-making. The review seeks to identify opportunities to improve the system and develop a framework for ongoing assessment, coordination, and governance of information needs into the future. |
