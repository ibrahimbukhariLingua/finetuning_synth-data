## Labor negotiations

Since February 2022, TruStage Financial Group and 450 employee members of OPEIU #39 have been negotiating a successor labor agreement to replace the previous agreement that expired March 31, 2022. Talks broke down in January 2023, with the union alleging the company was no longer engaging in good faith bargaining over union member priorities including fair compensation, pay equity, job security assurances against outsourcing, remote work protections, retirement security, and affordable health care. In February and March 2023, the union filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against the company asserting refusal to bargain, bad faith bargaining, refusal to furnish information, subcontracting unit work, retaliation against workers for union activity, all of which are prohibited by federal law. All of the ULPs filed during that time were later determined to be without merit and either dismissed or withdrawn, according to NLRB case data. On April 19, 2023, 87% of union members voted on whether to allow the union's bargaining committee to authorize a strike within 30 days if no labor agreement is reached. The measure was approved with 92% member support. Workers ratified a new contract in December 2023 that runs through March 2028 and includes pay raises of 15.5% retroactive to 2022 and a 13.25% pay raise over the four-year contract period.
