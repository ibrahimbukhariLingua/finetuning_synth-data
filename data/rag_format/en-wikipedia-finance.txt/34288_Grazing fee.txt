Grazing fee


# Grazing fee



A **grazing fee** is a charge, usually on a monthly basis, for grazing a specific kind of livestock.


## Australia

In New South Wales, Australia, maximum grazing fees have been set by regulation at $1.00 per head of large stock or per 10 (or less) head of small stock per day; lower fees may be set by individual authorities. Agistment on private land in Queensland, Australia, has sometimes been at rates of $5 per head per week when demand is high.


## United States

In the United States, grazing fees are generally charged per AUM (animal unit month). (Some additional fee or fees may be charged in various jurisdictions, e.g. per application.) On US federal grazing land, the grazing fee for 2012 (as for 2011) is $1.35 per AUM. As of 2015, the grazing fee has been increased to $1.69. Over several decades, the fees charged on US federal rangelands have generally been substantially lower than rates charged on private lands in the US. In 2006, the grazing fee on Oregon state lands was $5.60 per AUM.


## Canada

In 2015, grazing fees on Crown land in the province of British Columbia are $3.20 per AUM. In comparison, 2012 grazing rates in Alberta were $1.39-$2.79/AUM.
