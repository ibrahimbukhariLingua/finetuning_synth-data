## History

A former Government-owned enterprise with a history extending back over 100 years, Terralink International maintained and managed New Zealand’s largest and most comprehensive land and property information database.

This occurred following a receivership in January 2001, after which its ownership was 80% Animation Research Holdings Ltd, a New Zealand company specialising in 3D animation, and 20% Spatial Holdings Ltd.

Terralink International was 100% New Zealand owned and operated. In 2014 it was bought by and merged with Property IQ, and has now become CoreLogic NZ Limited; 60% owned by the US-based CoreLogic corporation.
