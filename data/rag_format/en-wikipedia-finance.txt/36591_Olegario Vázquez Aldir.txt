## Telecommunications Sector

In 2003, Grupo Imagen Telecomunicaciones was sold to Grupo Empresarial Ángeles (GEA). Vázquez Aldir presented a purchase and capitalization offer to the Fernández family (holding 48% of the shares) and the businessman Alfonso Romo (owner of 27%). This opened the door for Grupo Empresarial Ángeles to enter the communications sector.

Once Grupo Imagen was acquired, Olegario Vázquez Aldir restructured the company's commercial focus and acquired new frequencies nationwide to act as repeaters for Imagen Informativa radio programming.

Vázquez Aldir continued the expansion of Grupo Imagen in 2006, acquiring a national newspaper, Excélsior. This acquisition marked the end of the worker cooperative that managed it and began a new stage, with the relaunch of the newspaper on March 18, 2006, on its 89th anniversary. The relaunch included a new design and incorporated renowned collaborators and journalists, strengthening the brand's presence in the Mexican press.

After acquiring the radio group Imagen and the newspaper Excélsior, Vázquez Aldir acquired XHRAE-TV in 2006 to enter the television sector in the Valley of Mexico. After the purchase, on May 28, 2007, the channel was relaunched under the commercial name cadenatres, with coverage throughout the Mexican Republic thanks to agreements made with PCTV to incorporate the channel into all cable television systems and with Grupo Televisa to include it in satellite television.

Since mid-2010, the integration of various acquisitions gave rise to Grupo Imagen Multimedia, composed of different audiovisual media, including the radio stations Reporte 98.5 and Imagen Informativa 90.5, the newspaper Excélsior, and the open television channels Excélsior Televisión and Cadena 3.

In September 2016, the media group created by Vázquez Aldir became Grupo Imagen, with the launch of the Imagen television channel.
