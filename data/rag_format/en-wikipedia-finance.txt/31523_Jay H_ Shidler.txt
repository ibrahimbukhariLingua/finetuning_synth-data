Over the past decade, Shidler's transformational gifts to the Shidler College of Business at the University of Hawaiʻi has helped the College become one of the top ranked business schools in the nation.


### Naming Gift (2006)

In 2006, Shidler donated $31 million to the College of Business at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in Honolulu. The college, renamed the Shidler College of Business, used the gift to increase student scholarships and faculty research support, expand academic programs, provide matching gift opportunities, and renovate and upgrade classrooms, buildings and the surrounding environment.


### Visionary Gift (2014-2015)

In 2014, Shidler gave an additional $69 million commitment to the Shidler College of Business, growing his total gift to $100 million. The gifts included cash and interests in the land subject to long-term ground leases (leased fee interests) underlying U.S. office buildings and hotels.

The initial land gifts included the leased fee interests in the land under office buildings in the CBDs of Chicago, Illinois; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; and Nashville, Tennessee.

During 2015, the land gifts expanded to include leased fee interests in the land underlying 19 Marriott and Hilton hotels including the Marriott Fairfield Inn & Suites Midtown Penn Station in New York City as well as hotels in Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh, and Orlando.

As he was fulfilling his $69 million commitment, Shidler gave an additional $11 million, bringing the total gift to the College to $111 million.


### Innovation Gift (2017)

In October 2017, Shidler donated an additional $117 million, in cash and real estate ground leases, increasing his total gift to $228 million. Shidler's $228 million gift is the largest individual donation in the 110-year history of the University of Hawaiʻi, and makes him the second largest known donor to any public business school nationwide.

Income from ground lease payments will provide steady and increasing revenue to the College. Over the life of the 99-year ground leases, contractual income to the Shidler College of Business will average $21 million a year and total $2.1 billion. That income stream will be used to fund renovations and new programs, and will materially increase the number of available scholarships.

After each ground lease expires, the ownership of each office building and hotel will revert to the College. At that time, it is estimated that the College's stake in this portfolio will be worth in excess of $5.1 billion.
