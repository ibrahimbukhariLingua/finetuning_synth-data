## Political career


### Member of Parliament (since 2022)


#### 2022 general election

In the 2022 general election, Mohd Syahir made his electoral debut after being nominated by PN to contest for the Bachok federal seat. He won the seat and was elected to Parliament as the Bachok MP after defeating Mohd Zain Yasim of Barisan Nasional (BN), Nor Azmiza Mamat of Pakatan Harapan (PH), independent candidate Mohd Zulkifli Zakaria and Kamarul Azam Osman of Gerakan Tanah Air (GTA) by a majority of 29,901 votes.

As MP for Bachok, he was infamous for misleading remarks against Buddhist monks in a televised debate. In that same debate, his incompetence was evident as he read from a prepared script for the majority of the time. This prompted his opponent, the Minister of Economy, Rafizi Ramli, to ask, "Is this a debate or a reading session?" which drew laughter from the crowd.
