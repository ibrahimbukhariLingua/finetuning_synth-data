## History

Cryptek was founded in 1986 as Cryptek Secure Communications, Inc. At that time, the company designed and manufactured field-deployable, secure FAX machines for the military of the United States. In 1988, Cryptek was acquired by General Kinetics, a manufacturer of secure enclosures and other products. In 1993, General Kinetics also acquired Verdix, a manufacturer of secure computer networking equipment for the government of the United States.

In 1996, private equity firm Angelo, Gordon & Co. acquired the FAX and secure networking businesses of General Kinetics. The company continued to operate as Cryptek Secure Communications, LLC. The company simplified its name to Cryptek, Inc. in 2002.

In 2005, Cryptek went through a corporate restructuring in which Bill Anderson became the President and CEO. In 2007, Cryptek acquired three companies: Secure Systems Group of Sterling, Virginia, United States, Emcon Emanation Control Ltd. of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and Secure Systems & Technologies Ltd (SST) of Gloucester, United Kingdom. In that same year, Cryptek also acquired the assets of ION Networks of South Plainfield, New Jersey, United States.

Through a senior management purchase of assets, a new company Cryptek Technologies, Inc. began operation on March 11, 2009.
