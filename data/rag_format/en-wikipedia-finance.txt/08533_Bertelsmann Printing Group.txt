Bertelsmann Printing Group


# Bertelsmann Printing Group



The **Bertelsmann Printing Group** is a German group of companies in the printing industry with headquarters in Gütersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia. It was established in 2016 and is the market leader in Europe among offset and gravure printing companies. The Bertelsmann Printing Group is one of eight divisions of Bertelsmann, the international media, service and education conglomerate.


## History

In 2005, Bertelsmann and Axel Springer consolidated their gravure printing operations under the umbrella of Prinovis. Reasons for this included the industry-wide price decline and overcapacities. The Hamburg-based company was marked leader in Europe from the beginning. Bertelsmann indirectly owned 74.9 percent, with the subsidiaries Arvato and Gruner + Jahr each holding a 37.45 percent stake. Axel Springer owned the remaining 25.1 percent. In 2012, Prinovis became part of Be Printers, a newly-established division of Bertelsmann for the majority of the printing companies. This move was part of a larger reorganization of Bertelsmann under CEO Thomas Rabe who assumed his position in 2012. In 2015, Axel Springer sold its stake in Prinovis, making Bertelsmann the sole shareholder. In the process, Bertelsmann gained the opportunity to further streamline its printing operations.

Shortly after the restructuring, Bertelsmann announced in 2015 the establishment of the Bertelsmann Printing Group, effective January 1, 2016. All printing companies of Be Printers and the printing operations previously belonging to the sister division Arvato were bundled under the umbrella of the new corporate group. Several other service and production businesses, e.g. storage media manufacturer Sonopress, followed. At the time of its founding, the Bertelsmann Printing Group earned annual revenues of some €1.7 billion and had more than 8,000 employees. Independent of the merger, the brands of the individual printing companies, service and production operations remained intact. Over the course of the business year, it had a significant positive effect on the profit situation of the entire corporate group. In 2017, additional companies from the digital marketing business of Arvato have changed over to the Bertelsmann Printing Group.
