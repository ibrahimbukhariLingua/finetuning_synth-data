## Reception

*Brand Equity* wrote a mostly favorable review, criticizing Sinha for utilizing "bland business terms" while commending him for the "range and breadth of sources from which Dheeraj draws his data points, and mines them for insight." The *Business Standard* was mixed, writing "Some parts of the book are a bit tedious, especially when the author discusses political developments in great detail and describes Hindi films to show how popular culture reflects the changed thinking of consumers. But one thing is certain - if you want to understand the Indian mindset and how consumer psychology works, the book provides the on-ground realities and challenges for brands."
