Indiaplaza


# Indiaplaza



**Indiaplaza** was an Indian electronic commerce website. It was one of the pioneers in the online shopping space in India. Earlier known as Fabmart and then Fabmall, the company later acquired US-based online shopping firm Indiaplaza.com and rebranded itself as Indiaplaza.in in India, and as Indiaplaza.com in the United States, which were later merged into a single website.


## History

In June 1999, K Vaitheeswaran and five of his friends including V S Sudhakar, Vipul Parekh, Hari Menon, V S Ramesh and Sundeep Thakran founded India's first online departmental store. The website Fabmart.com was launched in September 1999 which then offered only music CDs for sale. Between February and October 2000, the website introduced additional categories including books, movies, watches, and groceries. In February 2002, they launched their first offline grocery store in Bangalore, India.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Funding

Indiaplaza.com received angel funding from The Indigo Monsoon Group (IMG), a private investment firm based in the USA known for investing in Indian Internet and mobile domains. IMG's other investments include Sulekha.com, an online community for Indians integrating social media with local commerce and EShakti.com, an online India-inspired and customized apparel retailer aimed at a global audience. In February 2011, Indiaplaza successfully concluded a deal for Series A US $5 million funding from Indo-US Venture Partners (IUVP) who had previously invested in other internet companies like Myntra, and Snapdeal.

Despite securing these funding sources, Indiaplaza was unable to raise sufficient funding in 2012–2013, which meant that the company had to cease trading.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
