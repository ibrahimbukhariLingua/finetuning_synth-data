The Marketing Practice


# The Marketing Practice



**The Marketing Practice**, also known as TMP, is a global, business-to-business marketing agency headquartered in Oxfordshire, England, and with offices in London, Munich, and Seattle. The agency works with IT, technology, and professional services companies including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Salesforce, Capgemini, and Telefónica O2, and has a strong focus on driving commercial results from marketing.

The B2B agency was founded by Clive McNamara in 2002 from his front room in Ardington, Oxfordshire. Early clients included Fujitsu and eGain. McNamara was formerly the marketing director at a large IT software company. He created The Marketing Practice after being unable to find one agency that offered a fully integrated B2B marketing solution.


## Work and results

Previous achievements include generating EMEA sales of 284x marketing investment for Atos and improving the Microsoft Lumia business market share from 12% to 26%. The agency has also been recognized as being in the top three 100% revenue B2B agencies in the B2B Agencies Benchmarking Report.


## Expansion

In 2008 The Marketing Practice moved to its current premises in The Old Estate Yard, East Hendred. The agency established its first non-UK office in 2016 in Munich, Germany, and a North American office in Seattle, Washington, later the same year.


## Sales and Marketing forums

The agency runs regular Sales & Marketing Forums ('S&M Forums’) for B2B sales and marketing industry experts and senior professionals. The event was highly commended in the Best Live Initiative Category at the 2010 B2B Marketing Awards, and has since included senior speakers from Microsoft, Genpact, CEB, Salesforce, Allianz Insurance, Telefónica O2, and many others.


## Industry recognition

The Marketing Practice has been the most-awarded agency at the B2B Marketing Awards in both 2013 and 2014.
