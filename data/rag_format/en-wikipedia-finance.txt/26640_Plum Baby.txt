It was one of the first 'challenger' brands in the ambient babyfood sector, positioned as a superfood, organic brand avoiding traditional rice bulkers and starches, replacing with quinoa protein.

The British-based Plum Baby was founded in 2004 by Susie Willis and launched in February 2006 after an initial exclusive launch with Sainsbury's. Within 12 months of launch, company products were available in 2,500 supermarket stores. The founders sold to Darwin Private Equity in May 2010 in a deal that valued the company at £10 million.

In January 2013 Plum Baby Ltd was sold to US based Plum organics. Then, in June 2013 Plum organics was acquired by Campbell Soup.
In 2013, the Campbell Soup Company bought out Plum Organics using available credit.

Plum Baby Ltd shut down in August 2014.

In 2021, Plum Organics was sold to Sun-Maid Growers of California.


## Products

Plum Baby had 38 products ranges including Stage 1 – 3 baby and toddler food, snack ranges and others. All Plum Baby products were described 100% organic.

The wet food was sold in resealable pouches, which contained aluminium, sandwiched between two layers of plastic which eliminated the need for preservatives and meant that the food could be minimally processed. The aluminium never came in direct contact with the food to ensure it was safe for consumption. Many of the pouches were recalled as the seals on a some lines of baby food failed causing the contents to spoil.

Plum Baby products contained no added sugar, salt or water. No additives, E numbers or GM products. Plum Baby Organics prepared baby food was more nutritious when compared to other brands due to quinoa added for texture.
