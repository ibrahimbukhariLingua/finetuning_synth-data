## Personal life

As a boy growing up in the neighbourhood of Korle Gonno, Accra, Saka was so inquisitive about the traditions of his people that anytime his father attended traditional functions such as outdooring and marriage or enstoolment ceremonies, he accompanied him. It was during such functions that he learnt about dances and the songs of his people, the Gas. His desire to know more about the traditions of the Ga people caught the attention of his colleagues at Achimota School, where he had his secondary school and teacher training education. He was made the head of the Ga group of the school in 1949. That leadership role gave him the opportunity to educate some of the students on the traditions and culture of the Gas through organised plays, dances and talks.

After the death of his first wife, Addo married Evelyn Naa Otua Addo (*née* Bonney), with whom he has one child called Genevieve Naa-Aku Addo.
