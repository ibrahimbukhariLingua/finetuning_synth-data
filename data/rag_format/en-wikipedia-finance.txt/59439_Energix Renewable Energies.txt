## Criticism


### Involvement in Israeli settlements

On 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of 112 companies helping to further Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights. These settlements are considered illegal under international law. Energix was listed on the database on account of its "use of natural resources, in particular water and land, for business purposes" in these occupied territories.

On 5 July 2021, Norway's largest pension fund KLP said it would divest from Energix together with 15 other business entities implicated in the UN report for their links to Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Energix Renewable Energies stated that, as of June 2021, it had divested from its activities in the West Bank.
