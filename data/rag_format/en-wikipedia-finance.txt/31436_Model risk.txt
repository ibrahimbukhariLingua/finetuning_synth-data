| **Case studies:** * Merrill Lynch (1970s; $70m loss) - for stripped bonds, used a single par yield instead of separate annuity yield-curves and zero-coupon curves for the resultant IO and PO securities. * NatWest (1997; £90m loss) - incorrect model specification, "a naive volatility input in their systems", for interest rate options and swaptions. * Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (1997; $83m loss) - a "systematic pricing bias" for out-of-the-money and Bermuda swaptions which had been calibrated to at-the-money vanilla swaptions. * Barclays de Zoete Wedd (1997; £15m loss) - mispriced currency options. * LTCM (1998; required $3.65 billion in recapitalization) - risk models had drastically under-estimated the risks of a profound economic crisis, due to an insufficient data-window and a lack of stress testing. * National Australia Bank (2001; $2.2 Billion AUD loss) - its Homeside interest rate model made inconsistent use of rates. * 2007–2008 financial crisis – Over-reliance on David X. Li's Gaussian copula model misprices the risk of collateralized debt obligations. |

In finance, **model risk** is the risk of loss resulting from using insufficiently accurate models to make decisions, originally and frequently in the context of valuing financial securities.

Here, Rebonato (2002) defines model risk as "the risk of occurrence of a significant difference between the mark-to-model value of a complex and/or illiquid instrument, and the price at which the same instrument is revealed to have traded in the market".

However, model risk is increasingly relevant in contexts other than financial securities valuation, including assigning consumer credit scores, real-time prediction of fraudulent credit card transactions, and computing the probability of an air flight passenger being a terrorist.
In fact, Burke regards failure to use a model (instead over-relying on expert judgment) as a type of model risk.


## Types

Derman describes various types of model risk that arise from using a model:


### Wrong model

* Inapplicability of model.
* Incorrect model specification.

### Model implementation

* Programming errors.
* Technical errors.
* Use of inaccurate numerical approximations.

### Model usage

* Implementation risk.
* Data issues.
* Calibration errors.
