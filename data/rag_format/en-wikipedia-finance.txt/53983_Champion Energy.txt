## Products and Services

Champion Energy Services offers a variety of retail plans depending on the market served and the customer classification. All markets and customer classifications can select fixed price plans that allow customers to lock in an electricity rate for the term of the agreement. For commercial customers, more complex options are available including index, hybrid (fixed and index combinations), block and index, and layered purchase options. These commercial plans are customer-specific, require greater customer involvement, and have a substantially different risk profile than fixed price plans.
