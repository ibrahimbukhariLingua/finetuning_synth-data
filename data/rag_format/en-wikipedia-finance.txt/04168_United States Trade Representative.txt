United States Trade Representative


# United States Trade Representative



The **United States trade representative** is the head of the Office of the United States Trade Representative and is the principal trade advisor to the president of the United States. The trade representative is responsible for managing and the day-to-day operations of the office. The trade representative is nominated by the president of the United States and, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance, is confirmed by the Senate. The United States trade representative and deputy United States trade representatives (DUSTR) carry the rank of ambassador.

The trade representative is a Cabinet-level position, though not technically within the Cabinet, as is the case with office heads not of US departments but rather of offices contained within the Executive Office of the President. The trade representative is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level $246,400, as of January 2024.


## History of the United States trade representative

Trade negotiations became more complicated in the twentieth century with the rise of multilateral organizations and technological advances allowing for more commerce. As a result, the organization of the U.S. government (with Congress in charge of regulating foreign commerce and the executive branch in charge of treaties) became less efficient and in 1962 Congress passed a bill calling for the president to appoint a special representative for trade negotiations who would make suggestions to the president on the matters of trade. In the 1970s, Congress expanded this position, making it more accountable to Congress (the position has been called "a creature of Congress"), and made it cabinet-level. Finally, in 1980 the position was renamed the United States trade representative.

The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 elevated the position's role to "coordinate trade policy, serve as the president's principal trade advisor and trade 'spokesperson', and lead U.S. international trade negotiations". It also "required the USTR to report to both the president and Congress".
