IIT Stuart School of Business


# IIT Stuart School of Business



**The Stuart School of Business** (**Stuart**) is the business school within Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech), a private Ph.D.-granting technological university, located in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Illinois Tech's primary campus, known as the Mies Campus in honor of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, is located in the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago. Stuart offers undergraduate courses at the Mies Campus and graduate courses at Illinois Tech's Conviser Law Center in Downtown Chicago.


## History

Business education at Illinois Tech dates back to the late 1890s, with courses in “Family and Consumer Science,” including “Home Economics” and “Household Management,” being offered by the Lewis Institute, Stuart's original home, and the Institute's subsequent formation of the university's Department of Business and Economics in 1926.

After the Lewis Institute and Armour Institute merged to form Illinois Institute of Technology, the Department of Business and Economics continued the work of Philip D. Armour, a merchant financier, Julia A. Beveridge, a librarian turned public administrator, Frank W. Gunsaulus, a preacher in the 1880s, and, with a gift from Lewis Institute alum Harold Leonard Stuart, became the Stuart School of Business. The school's namesake, Harold L. Stuart, was an American financier in the first half of the 20th century, and his Chicago investment bank played a role in establishing the city as a global financial hub. Stuart was also responsible for some of the earliest financing that established Chicago's train transportation network, now part of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA).

Over 125 years, beginning with Julia A. Beveridge and George N. Carman, early leaders of the Lewis Institute, as well as scholarly works by Herb A. Simon (author of *Administrative Behavior*, later awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics), Karl Menger (developer of the St. Petersburg paradox in economics), and Abe Sklar (developer of the Copula in financial modeling), the Stuart School of Business has evolved to provide education centered around management/administration, finance, and analytics. Illinois Tech has offered educational programs in public administration since the 1940s with Simon's groundbreaking, interdisciplinary work, and has awarded the Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) degree, the most widely recognized professional credential, since the mid-1960s. In 1990, Stuart established quantitative finance as an academic discipline, with the world's first postgraduate Master's program in Financial Markets and Trading. In 2023, Stuart celebrated the 10-year anniversary of its Marketing Analytics program and announced the rechristening of two additional analytics-focused programs, the Master of Science in Sustainability Management and Analytics and Chicago's only part-time Ph.D. program in Management Science and Analytics.

Stuart's mission states: *“The Stuart School of Business combines rigorous, relevant, and interdisciplinary academic and practice-oriented research and education. Our approach results in thought leadership and advances students’ careers in technologically oriented private and public sector industries worldwide.”* Today, Stuart offers academic programs (many STEM-designated) in the disciplines of business, economics, finance, analytics, marketing, management, and public administration paired with co-curricular leadership, mentorship, entrepreneurship, and experiential learning opportunities focused on student development and success that have positive societal impact and connect individuals to the business community.
