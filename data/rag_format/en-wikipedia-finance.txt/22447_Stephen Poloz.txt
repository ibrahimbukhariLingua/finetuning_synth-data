### Governor of the Bank of Canada

In 2013, Poloz was appointed as the Governor of the Bank of Canada on a seven-year term.

In January 2015, Poloz cut the Bank of Canada's key interest rate from 1 percent to 0.75 percent in response to a stark decline in oil prices. In July of that year, he cut the Bank's interest rate again to 0.5 percent. In July 2017, Poloz raised the Bank's key interest rate to 0.75 percent, the first interest rate increase in Canada in seven years. This marked the start of a series of five rate hikes in total; by October 2018, the Bank's key interest rate was at 1.75 percent. Throughout March 2020, Poloz reduced the Bank's interest rate from 1.75 percent to 0.25 percent in response to the economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic and a stark decline in oil prices.
