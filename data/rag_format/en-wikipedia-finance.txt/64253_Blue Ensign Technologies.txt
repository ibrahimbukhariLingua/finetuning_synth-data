## Rendall Process

In the Rendall Process, oil shale is mixed with a petroleum-based liquid fuel. The mixture is heated to 450 °C (840 °F) with pressure of ~600 PSI in a closed chamber before it's fed into a second unit for hydrogenation of kerogen in a hydrogen donor solvent. Shale gas vapors are captured to produce hydrogen for the processing unit and to generate heat and power.
