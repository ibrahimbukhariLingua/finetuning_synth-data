1 kroon


# 1 kroon



The **1 kroon** (1 EEK) is the smallest valued banknote of the Estonian kroon, the former currency of Estonia. Kristjan Raud (1865–1943), an Estonian painter, teacher, and cultural historian, is featured with a portrait on the obverse. A view of Toompea Castle in Tallinn appears on the reverse.

The 1 kroon was only issued once and had been steadily going out of circulation since a coin of the same value was also issued. At the time of replacement by the euro, it was very rarely found in use on an everyday basis. It can be exchanged indefinitely at the currency museum of Eesti Pank for €0.06.
