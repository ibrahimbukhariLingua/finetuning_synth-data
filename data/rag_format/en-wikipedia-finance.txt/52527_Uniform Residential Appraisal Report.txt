Uniform Residential Appraisal Report


# Uniform Residential Appraisal Report



A **Uniform Residential Appraisal Report** or **URAR** is one of the most common forms used in United States real estate appraisals. It was created to allow for standard reporting and analysis of single-family dwellings or single-family dwellings with an "accessory unit". It is also suitable for a building in a planned unit development (PUD) but is not meant to be used for appraisals of manufactured homes or condos.

The most current incarnation of the URAR is the *Fannie Mae Form 1004* updated for March 2005. It is considered a full appraisal with all three approaches to value, cost approach, sales comparison approach, and income approach.

* An exterior building sketch of the improvements that indicates the dimensions.
* Clear, descriptive photographs of the subject property and comparable sales used.
