# National Infrastructure Pipeline



The **National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)** is a group of social and economic infrastructure projects in India over a period of five years with an initial sanctioned amount of ₹102 lakh crore (equivalent to ₹120 trillion or US$1.4 trillion in 2023). The pipeline was first made public by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi during his 2019 Independence Day speech.

Real time data and details related to NIP can be found online at the India Investment Grid website which was launched in August 2020.
