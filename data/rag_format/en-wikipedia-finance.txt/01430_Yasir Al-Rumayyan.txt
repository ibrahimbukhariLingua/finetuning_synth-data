# Yasir Al-Rumayyan



**Yasir bin Othman Al-Rumayyan** (Arabic: ياسر الرميان; born 18 February 1970) is a Saudi businessman who is governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He also chairs the state-owned petroleum company Saudi Aramco and Saudi Arabia's largest mining company Maaden.

He is chairman of the English football club Newcastle United and manages LIV Golf. He is chairman of Riyadh Air. He is also involved in the construction of Neom, a controversial megaproject.

Al-Rumayyan is a close ally of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman. His early career was spent in finance. When King Abdullah died in 2015 and power consolidated around Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Al-Rumayyan was elevated to positions of power, including chairman of PIF and placed on the board of Saudi Aramco. After Bin Salman's 2017 purge of competing Saudi political elites, Al-Rumayyan and his associates filled the void and helped Bin Salman consolidate power. Al-Rumayyan was involved in transferring assets seized from other Saudi elites into the PIF.

Al-Rumayyan was involved in the transfer of assets to PIF in the wake of the Saudi Arabian government's 2017 purge. He transferred 20 companies that had been seized by the government into the PIF, including one later alleged to be used by Saudi operatives in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
