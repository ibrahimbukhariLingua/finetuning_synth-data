## History

Unica was founded in 1992 by Yuchun Lee, Ruby Kennedy and David Cheung. The company is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, with additional offices in the US, Australia, France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the UK. They primarily serve the financial services, insurance and healthcare, business-to-business services, retail, automotive, technology, telecommunications, travel and hospitality, media and publishing, energy, and pharmaceutical markets.

In August 2010, IBM announced its intent to acquire Unica for $480M. In Oct 2010 the IBM acquisition of Unica was completed. Post acquisition, the Unica portfolio was focused on Unica Campaign, Unica Campaign Optimization, Unica Marketing Operations, and Unica Interact. The Unica suite also retains Detect and Distributed Marketing for legacy customers.

In December 2018, HCL Technologies announced its intent to acquire Unica including other IBM products such as, Appscan for secure application development, BigFix for secure device management, Portal for digital experience, Notes & Domino for email and low-code rapid application development, Commerce for omni-channel eCommerce, and Connections for workstream collaboration. HCL Technologies had been engaged with IBM in an intellectual property partnership where HCL provided services, support, and development previously for some of these. In July 2019, HCL Technologies completed the acquisition of Unica and other noted products and subsequently formed a completely new division named HCL Software to manage the new software portfolio.

As of July 2019 the Unica module names were streamlined and renamed to:
Unica Campaign - Precision customer targeting at scale
Unica Plan - Enterprise grade marketing management
Unica Interact - Real time personalization in milliseconds

In the first year, Unica added over 2000 enhancements. With the July 2020 release, Unica will add three new products; Deliver, Journey, and Link which will be the largest expansion of the Unica platform in over 20 years. In addition, Unica will now be licensed as a wholistic platform instead of the individual product modules.

Unica Campaign - Precision customer targeting at scale
