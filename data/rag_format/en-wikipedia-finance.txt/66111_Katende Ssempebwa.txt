# Katende Ssempebwa



Founded in 1969, **Katende Ssempebwa & Co. Advocates (KATS)** is a Ugandan law firm headquartered in Kampala, the country's capital city. It is considered one of the leading corporate and commercial firms in Uganda.

KATS is the largest full-service law firm in Uganda in terms of staff size. The firm is a member of the LEXAfrica network, a pan-African legal alliance. John W. Katende serves as the firm's managing partner, while co-founder Professor Frederick E. Ssempebwa is recognized for his expertise in Ugandan constitutional matters and regional mandates.

KATS provides legal services to a diverse range of clients, including governments, non-governmental organizations, multinationals corporations, and other businesses. One prominent example includes advising Warid Telecom Uganda on its $500 million merger with Bharti Airtel in 2013. The firm has also acted as legal counsel for the Ugandan government on significant projects, such as the development of the country's first oil refinery valued at $3 billion.

KATS played a critical role in Uganda's legal history. Notably, the firm successfully argued before the Constitutional Court in 2007 that the death penalty for certain offenses was unconstitutional, leading to its abolition in the country. Earlier, the firm had contributed to the restoration of traditional institutions in Uganda by advocating for the removal of constitutional provisions that abolished them in 1966. KATS also played a part in the legal framework that enabled the return of confiscated properties to the Buganda kingdom and other traditional entities. These efforts ultimately facilitated the coronations of the Kabaka of Buganda and other traditional rulers in 1993.

This revised text removes promotional language and focuses on providing factual information about KATS' history, structure, clientele, and noteworthy legal work.
