## History

In 2012, Meydan Group announced the **Entisar Tower** as a 570 m (1,870 ft) tower and 122-story. Groundbreaking occurred in 2016. Construction was halted in 2017 due to Dubai's civic building proposals department issuing a stop-work order due to a payment dispute with the developers, with the ensuing property bust making the projects abandoned.

In 2018, Azizi Developments acquired the long-stalled Entisar Tower. In January 2024, the tower was rebranded, redesigned and renamed as Burj Azizi, and construction restarted on 18 January 2024.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
