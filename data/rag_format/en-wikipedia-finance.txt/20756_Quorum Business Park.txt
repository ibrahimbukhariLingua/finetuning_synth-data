Quorum Business Park


# Quorum Business Park



**Quorum Business Park** is an office development located in North Tyneside, North East England.


## Overview

Quorum was a part of the North Tyneside Enterprise Zone that existed from 1996 to 2006. The site originally housed Viasystems, a major semiconductor manufacturing plant. Following the closure of the plant, the current owners purchased the site and transformed it into a significant business park. Tritax provided funding for the development, with construction managed by Grantside, both serving as joint venture partners in the development company.

In 2009 and 2010, Quorum gained attention through a series of lettings, attracting around 250,000 square feet of office space occupancy from six new companies, including notable entities such as Tesco Bank, Balfour Beatty, and Convergys.

British Engines relocated their central core services teams to the park in December 2013. In August 2014, Cofely, a building and energy services company, moved into a 26,000 sqft office building in the business park.

In 2016, Greggs relocated its head office from Jesmond to Quorum Business Park.

In November 2019, Shelborne Asset Management acquired a significant portion of the park for £32m. As part of the acquisition, the park underwent rebranding in 2020 to enhance its image.

As part of the rebranding, the business park is now known simply as ‘Quorum Park’.
