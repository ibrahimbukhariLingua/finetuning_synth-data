They had a combined 312-day reign as tag team champions on both the Raw and SmackDown brands.


## History


### WWE (2016-present)


#### Debut and NXT Tag Team Champions (2016–2019)

Gary Gordon and Kenneth Crawford signed a contract with WWE in 2012 and 2015 respectively. Gordon, under the ring name Angelo Dawkins, initially was the hype man for Sasha Banks, later becoming a part of a tag team in the NXT brand for two years alongside Sawyer Fulton. The team of Dawkins and Crawford debuted on the March 16, 2016 episode of *NXT* (taped on January 21), where they lost to The Hype Bros (Zack Ryder and Mojo Rawley); this marked Crawford's in-ring debut.

On the July 12, 2017 episode of *NXT*, Dawkins and Crawford (now renamed Montez Ford) started appearing in weekly vignettes as The Street Profits. They made their return on the August 9 episode of *NXT* as fan favorites, defeating the Metro Brothers. The Street Profits would go on a winning streak, defeating the likes of The Ealy Brothers, Riddick Moss and Tino Sabbatelli, and local wrestlers. On the January 17, 2018 episode of *NXT*, The Street Profits suffered their first loss to The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar), failing to earn a NXT Tag Team Championship match at NXT TakeOver: Philadelphia on January 27. Later on, they entered the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, where they defeated Heavy Machinery (Otis Dozovic and Tucker Knight) in the first round, but were eliminated by AOP in the semifinals.

On the May 1, 2019 episode of *NXT*, The Viking Raiders (Erik and Ivar) vacated the NXT Tag Team Championship, but were immediately challenged by The Street Profits. The match ended in a disqualification after Oney Lorcan and Danny Burch, and The Forgotten Sons (Jaxson Ryker, Steve Cutler, and Wesley Blake) got involved. A four-way tag team ladder match for the NXT Tag Team Championship was scheduled for NXT TakeOver: XXV between The Street Profits, Lorcan and Burch, The Forgotten Sons, and The Undisputed Era (Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish). At NXT TakeOver: XXV on June 1, they won the NXT Tag Team Championship for the first time. On the July 10 episode of *NXT*, The Street Profits retained the titles against Lorcan and Burch, but on the August 15 tapings of *NXT*, they lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to O'Reilly and Fish. During this time, they started appearing on *Raw* in various backstage segments, a move that was said to be done in order to appeal to younger audiences. It was clarified by Dave Meltzer that the team were still NXT wrestlers and that this was not an official move to *Raw*.


#### Raw Tag Team Champions (2019–2020)

As part of the 2019 Draft in October, the Street Profits were drafted to the Raw brand, formally bringing them to the show. On the October 21 episode of *Raw*, the Street Profits defeated Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in their debut match. At Survivor Series on November 24, the Street Profits competed in a 10-team Interbrand Tag Team Battle Royal where they were the last team eliminated by the eventual winners, Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode. The team would hardly wrestle on *Raw* during their first few months on the main roster but mostly spent time backstage hyping up the shows. This was being done because Paul Heyman (who was executive director of *Raw* at the time) wanted to get their personalities out more to help them get more over with the fans, in front of a wider audience which ended up working for all parties involved later on.

On the December 9 episode of *Raw*, the Street Profits answered an open challenge for a title bout issued by Raw Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders, where The Viking Raiders retained. Four weeks later, the Street Profits were given another shot at the Viking Raiders' tag team titles, this time in a triple threat match that also involved Gallows and Anderson where The Viking Raiders retained once again. On the February 17, 2020 episode of *Raw*, after Kevin Owens and The Viking Raiders defeated Murphy and AOP via disqualification due to Seth Rollins' interference, the Street Profits came out and aided Owens and The Viking Raiders by attacking Murphy and AOP while Rollins retreated. Later, the Street Profits were scheduled to challenge Rollins and Murphy for the Raw Tag Team Championship at Super ShowDown on February 27, where they would be unsuccessful.

On the March 2 episode of *Raw*, the Street Profits were given a final opportunity "Last Chance Match" rematch, and with the help of Kevin Owens, they won the Raw Tag Team Championship. Later backstage, Rollins and Murphy challenged them to a rematch for the titles at Elimination Chamber on March 8, where the Street Profits retained the titles. They retained their titles again by defeating Angel Garza and Austin Theory on the second night of WrestleMania 36 on April 5. In the following weeks, the Street Profits feuded with The Viking Raiders as they faced each other in several competitions such as a game of basketball, axe-throwing, golf, bowling, and a decathlon which was later dubbed as the "Anything You Can Do, We Can Do Better" series. The series would end with a 3–3 tie between the Street Profits and The Viking Raiders. At Backlash on June 14, they were set to face the Viking Raiders, but the match did not start due to them brawling outside the building, being accosted by Akira Tozawa and a group of ninjas, and ending up in a dumpster. On the June 22 episode of *Raw*, The Street Profits retained the titles against The Viking Raiders, thus ending the feud. They then defended their titles against Andrade and Angel Garza successfully at SummerSlam on August 23 and at Clash of Champions on September 27.


#### SmackDown Tag Team Champions (2020–2021)

As part of the 2020 Draft in October, Dawkins and Ford were drafted to the SmackDown brand. They would then trade the Raw Tag Team Championship to The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) - who had just been drafted to the Raw brand - in exchange for the latter team's SmackDown Tag Team Championship. This would make the Street Profits the second team to acquire the WWE Tag Team Triple Crown.

Upon moving to *SmackDown*, they began a feud with the team of Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode. On the December 18 episode of SmackDown, the Street Profits successfully defended the titles against Roode and Ziggler. On the January 8, 2021 episode of *SmackDown*, Ziggler and Roode defeated the Street Profits to win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, ending their reign at a recorded 88 days. On the April 1 episode of *SmackDown*, they failed to regain the titles in a fatal four-way match also involving The Mysterios and Chad Gable and Otis. On the June 11 episode of *SmackDown*, Ford suffered a partial rib fracture from Otis; the injury put Ford out of action for months. In September, The Street Profits began a feud with SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos, leading to a match between the two teams at Extreme Rules on September 26, in which The Usos retained their titles. On the October 15 episode of *SmackDown*, The Street Profits failed to win the titles against the Usos in a Street Fight.


#### Championship pursuits (2021–2023)

As part of the 2021 Draft, The Street Profits were drafted back to the Raw brand. At Day 1 on January 1, 2022, they faced RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) for the Raw Tag Team Championship, but lost. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, on January 29, Ford and Dawkins entered the Royal Rumble match at #6 and #10, respectively, but would both go on to lose. On the second night of WrestleMania 38, on April 3, they once again failed to win the titles in a triple threat match also involving Alpha Academy (Chad Gable and Otis). At Money in the Bank on July 2, The Street Profits failed to win the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship from The Usos, as well as in a rematch at SummerSlam on July 30 with Jeff Jarrett as the special guest referee. At Clash at the Castle on September 3, The Street Profits teamed with Madcap Moss to defeat Alpha Academy and Austin Theory during the pre-show.

At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view, on January 28, 2023, The Street Profits entered the men's Royal Rumble match with Dawkins entering at number 11 and Ford at number 23, but were unsuccessful as Dawkins was eliminated by Brock Lesnar, while Ford was eliminated by Damian Priest. On the February 6 episode of *Raw*, Ford defeated Elias to qualify for the Elimination Chamber match for the United States Championship, while Dawkins lost to Damian Priest in another qualifying match. At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Ford failed to win the title. On Night 1 of WrestleMania 39, The Street Profits won the men's WrestleMania Showcase fatal four-way tag team match. As part of the 2023 draft, The Street Profits were drafted back to the SmackDown brand.


#### The Pride; addition of B-Fab (2023–2025)

On the July 14 episode of *SmackDown*, a returning Bobby Lashley appeared in a backstage segment with The Street Profits to recruit them to form an alliance. On the August 4 episode of *SmackDown*, The Street Profits interrupted a tag team match between Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson and The Brawling Brutes' Butch and Ridge Holland by taking out the participants in the match, turning heel for the first time on the main roster. The Street Profits then stood on the ramp with Lashley to celebrate the beatdown. The Street Profits and Lashley teamed up for a match for the first time to face the Latino World Order (LWO) in a six-man tag team match at Fastlane. A day before the event on *SmackDown*, the trio took out the LWO's Cruz Del Toro and Joaquin Wilde to leave the LWO a man short for the match. At the event, a returning Carlito teamed up with Rey Mysterio and Santos Escobar for the LWO to win the match. On the November 24 episode of *SmackDown*, The Street Profits failed to win the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship from The Judgment Day (Finn Bálor and Damian Priest) after interference from Rhea Ripley, turning face once again. The Street Profits, Lashley and B-Fab would call themselves as The Pride. At SmackDown: New Year's Revolution, The Street Profits as part of The Pride cemented their face turn after Lashley was attacked by The Final Testament (Karrion Kross and the returning Authors of Pain), and starting a feud in the process.

On Night 2 of WrestleMania XL on April 7, The Pride defeated The Final Testament in a Philadelphia Street Fight, thus ending the feud. On the April 19 episode of *SmackDown*, Street Profits won a fatal-four way tag team match to face A-Town Down Under (Austin Theory and Grayson Waller) for the newly renamed WWE Tag Team Championship but they failed to win the titles two weeks later. Lashley was inserted into the King of the Ring tournament but was later pulled out due to injury and was replaced by Dawkins. On the May 10 episode of *SmackDown*, Dawkins lost the first round qualifiers to The Bloodline's Tama Tonga. On August 16, The Pride quietly disbanded due to Lashley leaving WWE, although Street Profits and B-Fab would continue their alliance without any mention of The Pride as a stable. On the November 15 episode of *SmackDown*, Street Profits challenged Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) for the Tag Team Championship, but the match ended in a no contest after Tommaso Ciampa attacked both teams, after the match Angelo Dawkins attacked Alex Shelly leaving alongside Montez Ford, both of them teasing a heel turn in the process.


#### Heel turn (2025–present)

Over the next few weeks, Motor City Machine Guns entered into a feud with #DIY, and at the Royal Rumble in January, the Street Profits (without B-Fab) cost Motor City Machine Guns their opportunity at regaining the titles by attacking them and allowing #DIY to retain the titles, turning heel in the process. They also attacked DIY during their celebration after the match.

On the February 7, 2025 episode of SmackDown, during an interview, The Street Profits made a statement explaining their actions at the Royal Rumble and putting the entire SmackDown Tag Team division on notice saying that they’re after gold.
