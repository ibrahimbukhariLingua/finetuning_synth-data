Defence industry of Bangladesh


# Defence industry of Bangladesh



The **defence industry of Bangladesh** is a strategically important sector and a large employer in Bangladesh.The Government of Bangladesh is actively seeking to upgrade its military and security capabilities and has allocated increasing amounts to its defense and security-related budget.

The Directorate General of Defense Procurement (DGDP) manages procurements for the Ministry of Defense and the various armed forces, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Tenders for security and defense equipment and services are frequently open only to international bidders.
