Mastering the Universe


# Mastering the Universe



***Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea*** is a 2005 book by Roger Sweet and David Wecker that recounts Sweet's work behind the scenes of the corporate culture of the 1980s American toy industry.


## Description

Sweet (with his co-author and nephew David Wecker) details the creation of the *Masters of the Universe* toy line, its rise to immense popularity and then dizzying crash in which profits fell from a peak of $400 million in United States sales alone in 1986 to a mere $7 million in 1987. The book is primarily a view of the corporate side of creating *Masters of the Universe*, but details very little of the conceptual process behind inventing the individual *Masters of the Universe* characters and products.
