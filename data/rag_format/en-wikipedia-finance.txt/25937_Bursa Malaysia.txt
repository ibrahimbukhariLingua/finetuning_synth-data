## History

Bursa Malaysia was established in 1930, when the Singapore Stockbrokers Association became an official organization of securities in Malaya. In 1937, it was re-registered as the Stockbrokers' Association of Malaya, but it still did not trade public shares. In 1960, the Malayan Stock Exchange was formed and public trading started on 9 May that year. In 1961, a board system was introduced in two trading places, one in Singapore and one in Kuala Lumpur. The two trading rooms were linked by direct telephone lines into a single market with the same stocks and shares listed at a single set of prices on both boards.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
