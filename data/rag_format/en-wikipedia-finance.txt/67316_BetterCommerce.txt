# BetterCommerce



**BetterCommerce** (also known as OmniCX Digital Limited) is an e-commerce platform headquartered in Harrow, London and known for its headless, API-first commerce platform. It was founded in 2015 and has operations in the UK and India.


## History

The company was founded by Vikram Saxena, a commerce graduate from Delhi University who later pursued an MBA at Amity Business School. He began his career as a corporate trainer on Microsoft Office 97 at IIS Infotech, developing an interest in programming that led to a career shift. He purchased his first computer through an insurance claim. He started coding and found his first job as a software engineer at Trident Information System and later worked at companies such as HCL, and Satyam. In 2004, while working with a distribution company, Saxena moved to Germany in a Solution Architectâ€™s role. There, he designed and developed a B2B commerce portal used across Europe. In 2007, he left his job to focus on creating technology tools for businesses, founding Axtrum Solutions. In 2011, the company developed the Electronic Software Delivery (ESD) platform for Tech Data that earned it the 'Best Software Distributor Award' from Microsoft for three years. The platform was rolled out across 17 countries in Europe, the US, and Canada. In 2015, the team began developing an omnichannel and unified commerce platform, resulting in the formation of OmniCX, later rebranded as BetterCommerce.

In November 2021, the company acquired CanisHub and launched a new tool, BetterEngage.

In the same year, the company entered into a partnership with LAB Group, AdYogi, MTC, and Saffron Tech.
