Katangese franc


# Katangese franc



The **Katangese franc** (French: *franc katangais*), was the currency of the unrecognized State of Katanga between 1960 and 1963 during its brief period of independence from the Republic of the Congo. It replaced the Congolese franc at par and was consequently initially equal to the Belgian franc. This established an exchange rate of 50 francs = 1 U.S. dollar. Just before Katanga was re-annexed by Congo, the exchange rate had fallen to 195 francs = 1 U.S. dollar. The currency was replaced at par by the Congolese franc.


## Coins

Bronze coins were issued in 1961 in denominations of 1 and 5 francs. A non-circulating gold 5 francs coin was also issued for collectors. Only one set containing 1 francs and 5 francs were ever made, and they remain readily available to collectors at nominal cost. Their design shows a copper cross, which was locally used for money in precolonial times.
