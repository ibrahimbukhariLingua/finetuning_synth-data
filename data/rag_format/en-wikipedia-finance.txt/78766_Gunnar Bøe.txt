## Suspected Espionage

The Police Security Service (PST, POT) suspected Bøe of being a Soviet spy. Soviet documents released in the 1990s showed that he could be very outspoken in meetings with Soviet civil servants. He had a codename, "George," and had a series of meetings with KGB Rezident Aleksandr Startsev. By 1967, POT had bugged Bøe's phone, but they never found hard evidence to prove their suspicions. In 1984, POT tried to speak with him about his Soviet contacts, but were not successful. In July 2014, new information came to light with the release of more documents from KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin.
