The judges commented that the publisher cemented its reputation for excellent care of staff, authors and customers alike... “Edward Elgar combines longevity with constant innovation: they never rest on what they have achieved and always strive to stay the best in their field. The growth is exceptional for a mature business, and there’s a holistic strategy that works… it’s a special business.”

In 2017, Edward Elgar Publishing was awarded the prestigious Fox Williams Independent Publisher of the Year Award at the Independent Publishers Guild (IPG) Awards. As a "resolutely forward-looking business", expanding into law publishing and building digital platform Elgaronline, the judges praised EEP for "punching way above its weight despite competition from far larger operators". "Edward Elgar produced an outstanding performance in a difficult market in 2016," the judges said. "It is a very well run and profitable company with excellent partnerships, great author care and consistently superb customer service." At the same awards ceremony, EEP was also awarded the ProQuest Academic & Professional Publisher of the Year Award 2017. This brings the tally of major awards received in the last four years to six.

In 2015, the firm was nominated for three awards at the Independent Publishing Awards and won the Digital Publishing Award for their www.ElgarOnline.com online ebook and journal content platform. The judges cited the "excellent site design and back-end technology" and also applauded the way it provided free content to libraries in poorer countries: "That is sensible, creditable and important."

It is a great example of how a relatively small publisher can be at least as innovative as those many times its size".
