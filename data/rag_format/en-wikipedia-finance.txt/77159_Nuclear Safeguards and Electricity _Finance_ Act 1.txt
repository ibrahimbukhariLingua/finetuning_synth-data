# Nuclear Safeguards and Electricity (Finance) Act 1978



The **Nuclear Safeguards and Electricity (Finance) Act 1978** (c. 25) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which gave effect to safeguards associated with the international agreement on nuclear weapons. It also authorised the financing of Drax power station.


## Background

The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was made on 6 September 1976. In an agreement between the European Atomic Energy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency the UK had a Safeguards Agreement in connection with the Treaty. This Act gave effect to that agreement.

Parliament agreed that the Central Electricity Generating Board could use up to £50 million to build the second stage of the Drax power station in Yorkshire.
