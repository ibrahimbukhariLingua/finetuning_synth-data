### Resignation of Vikram Pandit

On October 16, 2012, then CEO Vikram Pandit unexpectedly resigned and was replaced by Michael Corbat. The *New York Times* later identified O'Neill as the driving force behind a months-long secret effort to oust Pandit, which culminated in a surprise ultimatum to Pandit stating that he must resign immediately, resign at the end of the year, or be fired. His resignation followed multiple payouts to investors during ongoing fraud allegations.
