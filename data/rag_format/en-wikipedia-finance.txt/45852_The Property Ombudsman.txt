The Property Ombudsman


# The Property Ombudsman



**The Property Ombudsman** (TPO) scheme is an ombudsman in the United Kingdom. It has been providing consumers and property agents with an alternative dispute resolution service since 1990.

The scheme was underpinned by statute in 2007 (estate agents) and 2014 (letting and managing agents) and approved by the UK government to help consumers settle their disputes with property businesses such as estate agents, letting agents and property management agents.


## Overview

The Property Ombudsman scheme can look at complaints made by consumers against agents registered with the scheme. This may include complaints about poor or incompetent service, including for example: communication and record keeping, marketing and advertising, complaints handling, instructions, terms of business, commission and termination, fees, referencing and inventories.

Before the Ombudsman can look at a complaint against a property business, the consumer must first give the business the opportunity to consider the complaint and attempt to resolve matters. If the business completes its complaints procedure or eight weeks have passed since the initial complaint was made to them, the consumer can take their complaint to the Ombudsman.


## Processes

The Ombudsman reaches a decision on complaints based on the evidence presented, legal principles, the relevant TPO Code of Practice and what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.

Where a property business does not subscribe to a TPO Code of Practice, the Ombudsman will make a decision based on best practice, legal principles and what is fair and reasonable.


## Funding

The Property Ombudsman is a not-for-profit ombudsman scheme, funded through membership and case fees. The income pays for the administration and functioning of the scheme. This model allows TPO to provide a free service to consumers, at no cost to the UK taxpayer.


## Impartiality

The Property Ombudsman publishes an annual report which outlines the proportion of total cases supported. In 2023, 61% of sales cases and 68% of lettings cases were supported in favour of consumers.

The Ombudsman is approved by Government, Trading Standards, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute and the Ombudsman Association as an impartial, unbiased and independent body, though decisions will inevitably be criticised by those parties who have lost.


## Status of Ombudsman decisions

In 2023, TPO received 57,635 enquiries and accepted 5,644 disputes for investigation.

Annual awards worth £1.52m were granted to consumers.

Nearly half of all complaints received by TPO were resolved before an Ombudsman decision was required. 83% of cases resolved by formal decision were found in favour of the consumer. The Ombudsman's decision is the final stage of The Property Ombudsman's process. If the consumer accepts the Ombudsman's proposed decision then this becomes a final decision and will be in full and final settlement of the dispute. Should the consumer not accept the proposed decision they have the choice to make a representation or choose to reject the decision. If the consumer does not accept the Ombudsman's decision their legal rights are not affected and are free to pursue the complaint through the courts.


## Accountability

The Property Ombudsman's Board has four main roles:

* Appoint the Ombudsman
* Set the Terms of Reference for the Property Ombudsman Scheme
* Ensure the Ombudsman's independence
* Approve the Ombudsman's budget

The Property Ombudsman has an independent reviewer who can consider complaints regarding the service provided by TPO. Raj Tutt is the current independent reviewer.

Satisfaction surveys are conducted for both consumers and property agents; these are conducted on a regular on-going basis and focus on two main factors: Service and Decision/Resolution Satisfaction.
