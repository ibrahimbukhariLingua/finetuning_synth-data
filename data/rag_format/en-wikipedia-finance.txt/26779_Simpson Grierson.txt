## History

The firm's history can be traced back to 1887 when Butler White & Hanna was established in Auckland, specialising initially in maritime law and insurance law, but adding local government law in the 1930s. In 1921 Grierson Jackson was founded followed two years later in 1923, by the founding of Simpson Coates & Clapshaw. In 1982 Grierson Jackson merged with Bruce Bornholdt's practice to form Grierson Bornholdt, acquiring a Wellington presence. The following year, 1983, saw Grierson Bornholdt and Simpson Coates & Clapshaw merge to create Simpson Grierson. Specialist fields include company law, commercial law, arbitration and construction and energy law. In 1985, Simpson Grierson and Butler White & Hanna merge to create Simpson Grierson Butler White. In 1991 the firm was joined by a number of partners from the former Brandon Brookfield, Wellington and in 1995, the firm adopted Simpson Grierson as its permanent name. Its Christchurch office was opened in 2007.

The firm is the sole New Zealand member of Lex Mundi, an alliance of 161 major law firms (including Australia's Clayton Utz).
