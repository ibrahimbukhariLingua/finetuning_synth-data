With operations worldwide, FGV produces oil palm and rubber products, oleochemicals and sugar products, with materials sourced from FELDA colonies throughout the country.


## Background

Its initial public offering in 2012 was the third largest in the world that year after Facebook and biggest IPO in Asia which raised US$3.1 billion.

It is the third largest palm oil company in the world by planted acreage. FGV manages a total land bank of 439,230 hectares in Malaysia and Indonesia including land under Land Lease Agreement (LLA) with Felda. The company produces approximately 3 million metric tonnes of crude palm oil annually.

In 2009, FGV purchased 51% of the largest sugar refiner in Malaysia, MSM Malaysia Holdings from PPB Group Berhad (founded by Robert Kuok) for RM1.25 billion.

On 3 July 2018, the company dropped the phrase "Felda Global Ventures" from their corporate name and renamed as FGV Holdings Berhad.
