## Company shutdown

In December 2018, HotelQuickly shut down abruptly due to a disagreement with its main provider and ongoing losses due to a technical mismatch from the provider which did result in large financial losses for the company. The company tried to negotiate reimbursement of these losses with its main provider but was not able to get to an amicable agreement therefore the company had to stop its operations and unfortunately canceling prepaid reservations and leaving travelers stranded without accommodation. The company recommended to its travellers to apply for a chargeback from their own credit card providers as it is the practice in the travel world In April 2019, a credit card processor filed a RICO lawsuit against HotelQuickly Ltd and its directors in US Federal Court. Case was dismissed with prejudice few month later.
