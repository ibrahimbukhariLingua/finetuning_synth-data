## Introduction

The Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act) provides for the incorporation of a flexible and modern corporate vehicle which was originally known as the New Manx Vehicle (‘NMV’).


## Background

In 2003, two Isle of Man law firms Cains, and Dickinson Cruickshank (now Appleby) began to jointly lobby the Isle of Man Government to enact a new legislation for a New Manx Vehicle (NMV) which could compete on equal terms with the International Business Companies being turned out in the thousand by the British Virgin Islands (‘BVI’). The result was the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006; a modern companies Act closely following the BVI template. Company number 1v was formed by Middleton Katz Chartered Secretaries LLC on 1 November 2006.

The Act is a stand-alone piece of legislation which supplemented existing Isle of Man Companies Act legislation rather than replaced it. Following its introduction, Isle of Man Companies can still be incorporated under the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931-2004 and the Limited Liability Companies Act 1996.

By the end of 2013, over 10,000 Companies had been incorporated pursuant to the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 and of those, according to Isle of Man Government statistics, 5637 remained on the register on 31 December 2013.
