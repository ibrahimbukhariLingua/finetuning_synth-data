**Doremus & Co**., more commonly referred to as Doremus, is a business communications agency focusing on both business-to-business and business-to-business-to-consumer audiences.

## History

In 1903, Doremus was founded by Clarence W. Barron, owner of *The Wall Street Journal*, in a corner of the *Journal'*s offices at 44 Broad Street in New York City.

It had nine accounts, all from the financial companies that want to advertise in the *Journal*. Harry Doremus, the agency's namesake, was an assistant who joined the agency from *The* *Wall Street Journal*'s advertising department. He had no equity in the company and left after two years following a controversy about editorial staff selling advertising.
