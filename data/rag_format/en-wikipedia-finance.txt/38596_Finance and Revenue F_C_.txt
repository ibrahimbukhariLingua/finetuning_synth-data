# Finance and Revenue F.C.



**Finance and Revenue Football Club** (often shortened as **F&R FC**), currently known as **Mountain Lion FC**, and formerly known as **Rangoon Customs**, is a Burmese professional football club operated by the Ministry of Finance and Revenue of Myanmar. The club is the most successful club in the history of the now defunct Burmese top-division football league. They won a total of 17 Burma First Division championships prior to 1996, and 9 Myanmar Premier League championships between 1996 and 2008. The club completed its dominance in the last edition of First Division football in 2009 by winning the Myanmar Premier League Cup 2009.

F&R's long presence in top division Burmese football has come to an end in April 2009 as the country's first ever professional league, the Myanmar National League, does not include any football clubs run by government ministries. In April 2009, the club released 17 of its players to the MNL, for a transfer fee of 9.7 million kyats (US$97,000).
