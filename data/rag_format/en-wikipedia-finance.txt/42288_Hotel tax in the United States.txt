A **hotel tax** or **lodging tax** in the United States is a tax levied by states, cities or counties against travellers when they rent accommodations (a room, rooms, entire home, or other living space) in a hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, or other lodging, generally unless the stay is for a period of 30 days or more. In addition to sales tax, it is collected when payment is made for the accommodation, and it is then remitted by the lodging operator to the city or county. It can also be called hotel **occupancy tax** in places like New York City and Texas. Despite its name, it generally applies to the same range of accommodations.

Hotel taxes in the United States are usually levied at a state level but in some cases cities and counties add additional charges on top.

Other examples of lodging follow:

* Camping sites
* Space at a campground or recreational vehicle park

States not listed below do not charge additional taxes on lodgings.


## Alabama

The state of Alabama imposes a statewide transient occupancy tax. In sixteen counties in northern Alabama, the rate is 5%, while it is 4% in all other counties. Counties and cities may charge additional tax, and rates vary by locality.


## Alaska

Several municipalities in Alaska impose lodging taxes, although no statewide tax exists. Rates vary from 3% to 12%.


## Arizona

Counties are authorized to impose additional taxes on lodgings of up to 6%.


## Arkansas

Lodging taxes in Arkansas are restricted to cities under 5,000 people with areas designated as historic districts and included on the National Register of Historic Places. These cities may impose a tax of up to 2%.


## California

The authority to levy the **transient occupancy tax** (TOT) is granted to the legislative bodies of both cities and counties by California Revenue and Taxation Code 7280.

The authority to collect the tax is generally granted to the county tax collector by an ordinance of the Board of Supervisors of that county. For example, the county code of Los Angeles County instructs hotel operators to pay the tax collector monthly.


## Colorado

Counties and municipalities may impose additional taxes on lodging. The same applies to local marketing districts. County taxes may not be more than 2%. while marketing district taxes can be of any rate. While originally intended to fund tourism promotions, the Colorado legislature amended the law in 2022 to permit funding for housing for tourism workers and capital projects. Voters will have the option to choose how funds are allocated, as long as at least 10% is allocated to tourism promotion.


## Connecticut

Connecticut charges a room occupancy tax for stays in hotels, motels, and beds and breakfasts. The rate is 15% for hotels and motels and 11% for B&Bs.


## Delaware

Delaware charges a lodging tax of 8%.


## Florida

Florida Statutes authorize local counties to impose transient rental taxes on rentals of hotels, motels, timeshares, and other short-term rentals. Various statutes allow for counties to impose rates between 3% and 6%. The variation depends on whether counties contain professional sports facilities or not, as additional tax can be imposed to offset public investment in such facilities.

Two other taxes may be imposed on lodgings. The first, the tourist impact tax, aims to protect environmentally sensitive areas. These areas include the Florida Keys and Apalachicola Bay. An additional 1% may be imposed to fund public land acquisitions. Additionally, three municipalities in Miami-Dade County (Bal Harbour, Miami Beach, and Surfside) are eligible to impose a municipal resort tax of up to 4%. These taxes are separate from the county-wide tax. The rate in Bal Harbour and Surfside is 4%, while it is 7% in Miami Beach. Municipal resort taxes "must be used for among other tourism related activities, for the enhancement of tourism, publicity and advertising purposes" according to statute. As the result of a concerted 5+ year international destination marketing effort funded by resort taxes in Bal Harbour, per capita resort tax revenues grew +35% owing to increased tourism longterm, demonstrating positive impact on municipalities as a result of total taxes (resort and non-) raised.


## Georgia
