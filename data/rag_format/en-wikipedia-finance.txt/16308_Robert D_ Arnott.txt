## Career

In college, Arnott contemplated a career in either astrophysics or finance. He opted for finance after deciding his math skills were inadequate for making serious contributions to science, but above average for finance or investing, as he later recalled, "where hardly anyone was using serious math at the time.”

After college, he worked at Salomon Brothers and in 1998 became chairman of First Quadrant, LP.

In 2002, Arnott founded Research Affiliates, a Newport Beach, California-based investment management firm. As of June 30, 2021, about $171 billion in assets are managed worldwide using investment strategies developed by Research Affiliates. The firm has been involved with fundamentally based indexes since mid-2004 and has worked with the FTSE Group to create indices based on this methodology. Research Affiliates licenses its indexes to Schwab, Invesco and PIMCO.

In November, 2009, Research Affiliates was granted a patent for their index methodology that selects and weights securities using fundamental measures of company size.

Arnott co-manages the PIMCO All Asset Fund, a tactical fund of funds with $16 billion in assets as of March 2022, which can invest in any of PIMCO's many mutual funds. This fund is intended to feature what Arnott calls "Third Pillar" options, meant to diversify beyond mainstream stocks and investment-grade bonds, and may include master limited partnerships, high-yield bonds, emerging markets debt, or liquid alternatives with the goal of boosting long-term portfolio performance.

Arnott has given $750,000 to support the Club for Growth, a politically conservative group advocating lower tax rates. Arnott considers himself a libertarian, and opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
In 2015, Arnott donated $100,000 to America's Liberty PAC, a political action committee formed in support of Representative Rand Paul's 2016 presidential bid.
