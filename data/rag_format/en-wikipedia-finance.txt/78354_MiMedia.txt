## Description of Business

MiMedia has built the MiMedia Platform, a next generation consumer cloud platform that enables consumers to access all their personal content (photos, videos, music, documents, SMS and contacts), on any device or operating system, whenever they want.

The MiMedia Platform enables consumers to access their content on any device by integrating seven apps into one platform â€“ desktop apps for PC & Mac, smartphone apps for iOS & Android, tablet apps for iOS & Android and a web app that works on all browsers.


## Business Model

MiMedia operates a business model that is recurring, high-margin and diversified with multiple revenue streams:

1. *Subscriptions / Freemium model:* Free storage plan and multiple paid plans to upgrade for more storage.
2. *Mobile Advertising:* Non-intrusive advertisements within the smartphone gallery.
3. *Value Added Services:* Photo printing, premium photo editing and digital scanning, among others.

MiMedia may either share in the revenue generated with its partners or charge a license fee per user of its software. Branding in these deals is either "MiMedia" or ingredient, "powered-by MiMedia" branding. Selection and deployment of revenue streams will depend on target country dynamics. MiMedia's revenue streams are deployed and generating revenue today, with MiMedia's primary revenue engine of mobile advertisements showing strong and consistent metrics at scale that support the core model's go-forward assumptions.

MiMedia's partners assume the major cost components typical of MiMedia's business model, thus driving higher margins for MiMedia.
