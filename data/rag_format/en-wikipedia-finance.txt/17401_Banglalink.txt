## History

Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Ltd. was granted license in 1989, to operate in the rural areas of 199 upazilas. The company started providing GSM service in 1998.

In July 2004, an Egypt-based company, Orascom Telecom, purchased Sheba Telecom and formed Banglalink brand, as sheba telecom failed to tap the business potentials in Bangladesh mainly due to a chronic feud between its Malaysian and Bangladeshi partners. The purchasing value was US$60 million, of which US$50 million for share value and US$10 million was for financial debt.

Integrated Services Ltd. (ISL), the Bangladeshi partner, was being 'officially' shown as purchasing the shares held by Technology Resources Industries (TRI) of Malaysia for $15 million. ISL then paid another $10 million to Standard Chartered Bank to settle Sheba's liabilities.

In September 2004, Orascom Telecom Holdings purchased 100% of the shares of Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited. It was acquired for US$60 million. Sheba had a base of 59,000 users, of whom 49,000 were regular when it was sold. Afterward it was re-branded and launched its services under the "*Banglalink*" brand on 10 February 2005.

In March 2008, Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited changed its name to Orascom Telecom Bangladesh Limited, matching its parent company name.

In July 2013, following the 2011 ownership restructuring in the parent company, the company name changed for the second time to Banglalink Digital Communications Ltd.


### Achievements

Today it earns 1588 Taka crore and having around thousand of employs. Banglalink also won 4 oklla awards for having the fastest network in Bangladesh.


## Numbering scheme

Banglalink uses the following numbering scheme:

+88019N₁N₂N₃N₄N₅N₆N₇N₈ & +88014N₁N₂N₃N₄N₅N₆N₇N₈

Where '+880' is the ISD code for Bangladesh and is needed only in case of dialing from outside Bangladesh.

'19' & '14' are the access codes for Banglalink as allocated by the Government of Bangladesh. Omitting +880 will require using 0 in place of it instead to represent local call, hence 019 & 014 are the general access codes. N₁N₂N₃N₄N₅N₆N₇N₈ is the subscriber number.

In 2018, when Mobile number portability was introduced users can port to any operator without changing its number.
