TIBOR


# TIBOR



**TIBOR** stands for the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate and is a daily reference rate based on the interest rates at which banks offer to lend *unsecured* funds to other banks in the Japan wholesale money market (or interbank market). TIBOR is published daily by the JBA TIBOR Administration.


## Technical features

TIBOR is calculated based on the quotes for different maturities provided by reference banks at about 11.00 a.m. each business day.

There are two forms of TIBOR rates:

* Japanese Yen TIBOR rate - This was introduced in November 1995. It reflects rates in the unsecured call market.
* Euroyen TIBOR rate - This was introduced in March 1998. It reflects rates in the offshore market. This will be terminated in 2024.
