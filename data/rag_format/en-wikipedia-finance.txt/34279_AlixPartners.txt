## Founding

AlixPartners was founded in 1981 as Jay Alix & Associates PC in Southfield, Michigan, by Jay Alix, a Detroit-area Certified Public Accountant (CPA). According to *BusinessWeek*, the "firm pioneered consulting to companies in or near bankruptcy". It first found public recognition in 1984, when working with the bankrupt automotive company DeLorean Motor Co, finding an additional $100 million for the company's creditors.


## Business structure

AlixPartners' work includes enterprise improvement consulting, financial advisory services, information management services, and executing turnarounds of distressed and healthy companies. AlixPartners has been involved in several high-profile turnaround and bankruptcy assignments including GM's Saab division, Kodak, Barney's New York, and JC Penney.

In December 2014 the firm purchased Evidence Exchange, a litigation support company.

In February 2015, AlixPartners purchased Zolfo Cooper's UK & European operations for $100 million. In November 2018, the firm completed the acquisition of independent financial advisory and interim management firm Zolfo Cooper, thereby increasing the turnaround and restructuring group to nearly 350 employees worldwide.

In January 2016, AlixPartners UK managing director and former Zolfo Cooper Europe CEO Simon Freakley succeeded Fred Crawford as the company's CEO. That year, CVC Capital Partners agreed to sell its stake in AlixPartners to company founder Jay Alix as well as Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Public Sector Pension Investment Board, and Investcorp.

In 2014, AlixPartners accused several executives exiting the firm to join McKinsey & Company of stealing trade secrets.

In 2018, AlixPartners founder Jay Alix brought a lawsuit against McKinsey & Company, accusing the management consulting firm of misleading the bankruptcy courts about conflicts of interest. As of August 2023, McKinsey had lost its bid to end the racketeering litigation brought by Jay Alix.
