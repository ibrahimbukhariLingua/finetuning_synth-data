The Village Market is located in the Gigiri residential area which is about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Nairobi city center on Limuru Road. The complex is designed to resemble an open-air African market, including waterfalls, rivers, plants and gardens.


## History

In 1992, two Iranian brothers, Hamed and Mehraz Ehsani had the idea of constructing a shopping and recreation mall within Nairobi. Their objective was to provide a shopping and recreation experience for Gigiri's residents which include diplomats, expatriates and tourists living and/or working within the Nairobi's Diplomatic District and its immediate environs.

Construction began in April 1992 with a proposed 10 shops. Three years later they opened The Village Market's gates to the public. Today the complex covers over 225,713 square feet (20,969.4 m²) of leasing space; three levels high, with more than 150 outlets, and was the first mall to introduce a food court to Kenya. The Village Market offers a variety of recreational facilities, that included a swimming and water slides area, bowling and mini-golf facility. In early 2014 these recreational areas were closed down to allow for expansion of the Mall. The current expansion will bring in over 70 new retail and service spaces and is expected to be complete in full by November 2016 to include a new three star business hotel with 215 rooms, a variety of conference areas and a pool.

The Village Market adjoins the Tribe Hotel, a 5 star hotel with 142 guest rooms and suites.
