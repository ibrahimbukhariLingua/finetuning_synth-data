The Qube (Detroit)


# The Qube (Detroit)



**The Qube**, also known as **Chase Tower**, is a 14-story high-rise office building in downtown Detroit, Michigan. It is located on Campus Martius at the northeast corner of the Detroit Financial District. Designed by Albert Kahn Associates in the modern architectural style, it includes a great deal of marble, similar to other buildings in the nearby Civic Center.

The building was originally known as the **National Bank of Detroit Building**, and later as the **Bank One Center**.


## History

The Qube stands on the site of Detroit's first skyscraper, the Hammond Building. The ground floor of this building is a massive 1.5-story glass sheathed, banking hall. The building was known as 'Chase Tower' from 2006 to 2011 to reflect Chase Bank's buyout of Bank One. In March 2007, the Sterling Group purchased the tower from JP Morgan Chase. Occupancy was approximately 50 percent at the time of sale. The building has had 3 official names now, for each of the 3 successive banks that have owned it: National Bank of Detroit (NBD), succeeded by Bank One, and lastly Chase.
The building has gone by several names in the past, most notably: Bank One Center, National Bank of Detroit Building, Bank One Building and Chase Tower.

In April 2011, Quicken Loans bought the building, renamed it the Qube and relocated 4,000 of the company's employees to the facility. The company plans to fill remaining space with retail.

In August 2014, the Detroit bureau of Southfield-based ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV moved into the Qube after spending several decades across from the headquarters of the Detroit Police Department; its new location now includes satellite studio and newsroom facilities.
