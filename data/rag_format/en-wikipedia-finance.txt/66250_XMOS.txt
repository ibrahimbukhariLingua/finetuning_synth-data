**XMOS** is a fabless semiconductor company that develops audio products and multicore microcontrollers. The company uses artificial intelligence and other sensors in the platforms that it develops. It creates voice interface technology developments for applications in various services that are voice activated.


## History

XMOS was founded in July 2005 by Ali Dixon, James Foster, Noel Hurley, David May, and Hitesh Mehta. It received seed funding from the University of Bristol enterprise fund, and Wyvern seed fund.
