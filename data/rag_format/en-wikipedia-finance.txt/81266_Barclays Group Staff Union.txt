Barclays Group Staff Union


# Barclays Group Staff Union



The **Barclays Group Staff Union** was a trade union representing workers at Barclays Bank in the United Kingdom.

The union was founded in about 1918 as the **Barclays Bank Staff Association**. It was registered as an independent trade union in about 1980, and by the mid-1990s had more than 46,000 members, representing over half of the bank's employees. In 1998, the union changed its name to **UNiFI**, then the following year merged with the Banking, Insurance and Finance Union and the NatWest Staff Association to form the very similarly named UNIFI.
