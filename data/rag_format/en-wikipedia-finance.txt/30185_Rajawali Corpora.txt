Rajawali Corpora


# Rajawali Corpora



**PT Rajawali Corpora** (**RC**) is an Indonesian holding company based in Jakarta, Indonesia. The corporation was formerly established in 1984 by Peter Sondakh as Rajawali Wira Bhakti Utama. Throughout the decades, Rajawali has developed into a regional player in several major business ventures and portfolios, ranging from agriculture, infrastructure, information, technology, consumer goods, media, communication, mining, natural resources, property, hospitality, retail, and transportation services.

In 2004, Sondakh founded Rajawali Foundation (RF) as the philanthropic arm of Rajawali Corpora. The mission of RF is to promote peace, prosperity, and the conservation of Indonesia's natural heritage through support for research, education, and training. The foundation's emphasis on education reflects Sondakh's view that knowledge, skills, and creativity are the true foundations of equitable and sustainable economic development.
