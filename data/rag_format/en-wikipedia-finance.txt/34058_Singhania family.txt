## Family history

As per records of JK Temple Kanpur, Vinodi Das Singhania left his home in Singhana - a little town in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan - in 1775. He resettled in Farrukhabad, a small business town near Kanpur. He started off as a Banker and diversified into trading. This was the time when East India Company was entering India. His sons - Ramsukhdas and Sarbsukhdas - later joined the family business and opened branch offices in Kanpur, Kolkata, Varanasi and Mirzapur.

After Ramsukhdas and Sarbsukhdas, the business was passed on to Ramsukhdas' son, Sewaram. Baldeodas took over the reins of the business along with his brother Munnalal from his father Sewaram. During this time the family also earned the royal title of 'Rajah Sahib'ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ . Baldeodas had six sons and among them was Juggilal who took over the family business and played an important role in expanding and diversifying the business from bankers and traders to industrialists. In 1905, Juggilal and his family shifted to their Kanpur house after a division in the family business which then owned two flour mills — the Ganges Flour Mill and Cawnpore Flour Mill — apart from being the sole selling agents for Elgin Mills, Cawnpore Cotton Mills and Victoria Mills. The division created two new business units - Baldeodas-Kedarnath and Baijnath-Juggilal.

After Kamlapat the business was passed on to his three sons - Padampat, Kailashpat and Lakshmipat. Padampat established Straw Products Ltd in 1940 with support from Nawab of Bhopal - Hamidullah Khan. The brothers set up a gas plant - JK Rampur Gas Plant - with support from princely state of Rampur. They also acquired a plant of the Aluminium Corporation of India in Asansol. Lakshmipat took the lead in order to make the plant operational. He also established a small steel plant - JK Steels - near Rishra in West Bengal, and a paper mill in Odisha. The brothers also acquired National Insurance Company during the period of World War II. The family supported the British Government during the war years and stepped up the production to meet the needs of British Army. Due to the support given to British Government during the war years, Padampat Singhania was conferred with knighthood at The Viceroy's House, New Delhi, on 23 February 1943.

In 1944, the family bought a woolen textile mill - Raymond Woollen Mills - in Thane from E.D. Sassoon & Co. Kailashpat took charge of the company and was instrumental in its growth. Today Raymond Group is a leading producer of fabrics in India. The business subsequently got divided between the brothers. Padampat took over the north Zone with Kanpur as headquarters. Lakshmipat resettled in Kolkata and took control of eastern zone while Kailashpat moved to Mumbai to head the western zone. Later on Lakshmipat moved to Delhi and established it as headquarters for businesses under his control.
