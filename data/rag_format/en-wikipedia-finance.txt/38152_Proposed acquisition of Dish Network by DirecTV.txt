Proposed acquisition of Dish Network by DirecTV


# Proposed acquisition of Dish Network by DirecTV



On September 30, 2024, broadcast satellite and streaming company DirecTV reached an agreement to acquire Dish Network from EchoStar. EchoStar and DirecTV expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, contingent on regulatory approval and bondholders writing off nearly $1.6 billion in Dish-related debt.


## Background

In 2002, Dish Network chairman Charlie Ergen attempted to merge the network and DirecTV. Ergen's proposal was blocked by the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Department of Justice over concerns that the merger would harm competitors. The Department of Justice expressed objections to a potential merger in 2020 over the availability of broadband cellular networks in rural areas, according to *The New York Times*.

Dish Network informed investors in August 2024 that it was unable to accrue additional capital to resolve US$2 billion in debt due in November; the company has an estimated US$500 million in liquidity.


## Agreement

On September 30, 2024, DirecTV agreed to acquire Dish Network and Sling TV for US$1. Under the agreement, DirecTV would take on Dish's debt. EchoStar, Dish Network's parent company, would continue to retain its wireless Boost Mobile and satellite connectivity businesses. Two-thirds of Dish Network's creditors must agree to the agreement and exchange their debt under DirecTV.

Investment company TPG Inc. also announced that it would acquire a AT&T's 70% stake in DirecTV for US$7.6 billion, giving it complete ownership over the company. This deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025, regardless of the outcome of DirecTV's proposed acquisition of Dish Network.
