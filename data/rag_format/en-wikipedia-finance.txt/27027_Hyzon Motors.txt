Hyzon Motors was founded in 2020 as a spin-off of Singapore-based Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, which was founded in 2003 with a focus on developing fuel-cell-powered trucks and buses.

In 2021, Hyzon Motors went public with a SPAC merger with Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation.

In June 2022, Hyzon received its zero-emission certification from the California Air Resources Board for its Class 8, 7, and 6 Repowers. That same month Hyzon announced a collaboration with oil field services company Schlumberger Limited, aiming to reduce emissions in upstream oil and gas operations through the use of high-power fuel cells.

Parker Meeks was appointed President and interim CEO in August 2022, and CEO in March 2023.

In November 2023, Hyzon completed its first commercial journey to Texas with its liquid hydrogen truck. In June 2023, Hyzon partnered with Performance Food Group to deliver 5 fuel-cell electric vehicles fitted with Hyzon Class 8 110kW fuel cell systems. Additional vehicles will be fitted with Hyzonâ€™s next-generation single 200kW fuel cell system.
