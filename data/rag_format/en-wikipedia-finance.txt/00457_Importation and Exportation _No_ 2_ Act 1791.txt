Importation and Exportation (No. 2) Act 1791


# Importation and Exportation (No. 2) Act 1791



The **Importation and Exportation (No. 2) Act 1791** (31 Geo. 3. c. 30) is an act of the Parliament of Great Britain that consolidated acts relating to the importation and exportation of corn and amended the payment of duties on imported corn and the bounty on exported corn.


## Background

As a staple of life, as well as an important commodity of trade, corn and its traffic was long the subject of debate and of government regulation â€“ the Tudors legislating against speculating in corn, and the Stuarts introducing import and export controls. Import had been regulated as early as 1670; and in 1689 traders were provided bounties for exporting rye, malt and wheat (all classified as corn at the time, the same commodities being taxed when imported into England). In 1773, the Corn Act 1772 (13 Geo. 3. c. 43), "An act to regulate the importation and exportation of corn" repealed Elizabethan controls on grain speculation; but also shut off exports and allowed imports when the price was above 48 shillings per quarter (thus compromising to allow for interests of producers and consumers alike).

By the 1790s, the issue remained one of public debate (by figures such as Edmund Burke), and parliament desired to make changes to favour agricultural producers.

## Legacy

The Select Committee on Temporary Laws described this act as a Consolidation Act.

In 1804, the Importation and Exportation Act 1804 (44 Geo. 3. c. 109) amended the act, further agricultural producers.

The act was wholly repealed by the Importation and Exportation Act 1821 (1 & 2 Geo. 4. c. 87). This formed part of the Corn Laws, tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846.
