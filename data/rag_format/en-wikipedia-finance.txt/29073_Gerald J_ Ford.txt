Ford has a history of buying banks, re-organizing them, and subsequently selling them at a substantial profit, with Golden State Bancorp and then bailed-out Pacific Capital Bancorp, being most notable wins.

In a 2010 interview on entrepreneurship with *Forbes*, he suggested reading *The Great Gatsby* by F. Scott Fitzgerald, *The Financier* by Theodore Dreiser, *The Bonfire of the Vanities* by Tom Wolfe, Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin and *The Big Short* by Michael Lewis*.*


### Philanthropy
