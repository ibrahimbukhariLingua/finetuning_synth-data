Physioeconomics


# Physioeconomics



**Physioeconomics** (or **physio-economics**) is an extension of experimental economics research that collects physiological parameters in addition to recording behavior. These measures can include skin conductance, blood pressure and the pulse of the subject. Experiments typically present subjects with economic decisions in a game–like context.

The term has also been used by Philip M. Parker in his book *Physioeconomics* to refer to his theory of the physiological basis of economics, according to which the equatorial paradox (that countries further from the equator have higher GDP per capita) is explained by the pressure on humans located in cold climates to restore their physiological homeostasis, for example by agriculture and wealth-creation.

The field of physioeconomics is interdisciplinary, drawing on concepts and methods from economics, physiology, psychology, and other disciplines. Its goal is to understand how the human body and mind respond to economic stimuli, and how these responses affect economic behavior. Physioeconomics has been used to study a wide range of topics, including consumer behavior, financial decision-making, work productivity, and stress. The field has also been applied to policy issues such as the design of work environments and the provision of health care. A number of different research methods are used in physioeconomics, including laboratory experiments, field studies, and surveys. The insights gained from physioeconomic research can be used to improve the well-being of individuals and society as a whole.


## Background

Traditional experimental economics places individuals in situations where they have to make decisions about questions that affect their real or theoretical pocketbooks. Such experiments are conducted in a controlled laboratory environment. The analysis of the experiments is limited to the evaluation of market outcomes and questionnaires. The survey provides only subjective impressions. Another issue is that questionnaire answers often follow social norms rather than revealing the subject's real view. Physiological parameters, such as skin conductance, provides additional, objective measurements that allow a deeper insight into the decision-making process.

Particularly in the study of markets and negotiations, understanding the behavior and motives of participants is necessary. Therefore, the influence of emotions on decisions and behavior is of great interest. Physiological measurements can help explain these elements. The methodology for physically measuring emotions is well–researched and provides an established means dar.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


## Differentiation from related fields

The field of neuroeconomics examines brain activity in economic decision situations with methods of magnetic resonance imaging or electroencephalography, and so can be considered a subfield of physio-economics. As of 2011, these technologies are considerably more expensive than other techniques of physio-economics.
