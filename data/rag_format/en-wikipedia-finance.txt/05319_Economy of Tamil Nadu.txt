Economy of Tamil Nadu


# Economy of Tamil Nadu



**Tamil Nadu** has the second largest economy of any state in India. The state is also the most industrialised in the country. The state is 48.40% urbanised, accounting for around 9.26% of the urban population in the country, while the state as a whole accounted for 5.96% of India's total population in the 2011 census. Services contributes to 54% to the gross domestic product of the state, followed by manufacturing at 33% and agriculture at 13%.

Government is the major investor in the state, with 52% of total investments, followed by private Indian investors at 29.9% and foreign private investors at 14.9%. It has been ranked as the most economically free state in India by the Economic Freedom Rankings for the States of India.


## Political economy of Tamil Nadu

India is a large country of different peoples, cultures, languages and landscapes. As a country with a quasi-federal structure of Governance, a lot of the successes and failures of state governance and economies can be attributed to state specific socio-economic contexts and policies.

For decades, Tamil Nadu has consistently performed above national averages for Social and Economic indicators and is today the 2nd largest economy in the country after Maharashtra. These successes are impossible to discuss without acknowledging the unique Political Economy of the state as most of the growth seen by Tamil Nadu happened after national political parties lost relevance in the state and were replaced by local Dravidian Parties. Since the 1967 legislative assembly election in Tamil Nadu, the state has been ruled either by the DMK or its offshoot and rival, the AIADMK. Today, the 2 large Dravidian parties, the DMK and AIADMK together control 199 seats out of the 234 seats in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.

In the 1960s, TN was lagging behind the Indian average in many socio-economic indicators. It's Urban and Rural poverty rates were worse than the pan-Indian average but as of 2011-12, poverty rates had come down to 6.5 percent, 3rd lowest among major states and lower than the economically important states of Maharashtra and Gujarat.


### Socio-politics of pre-independence Madras Province

The growth of Tamil Nadu can be attributed to the unique development of the state's socio-political sphere. During the British rule of India, the territory of what is today Tamil Nadu was a part of the Madras Province.

Rationalist literature was used for the critique of Social power in a caste society.

The following table shows the distribution of selected jobs among different caste groups in 1912 in Madras Presidency.

| **Caste group** | Deputy collectors | Sub judges | District Munsifs | % of total male population |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| non-Brahmin Hindus | 30 | 3 | 25 | 85.6 |
| Muslims | 15 | nil | 2 | 6.6 |
| Indian Christians | 7 | nil | 5 | 2.7 |
| Brahmins | 77 | 15 | 93 | 3.2 |
| Europeans and Eurasians | 11 | nil | 3 | .1 |


### Rise of Dravidian politics

It is this context of upper caste hegemony that gave rise to Dravidian politics. The discovery of a wealth of ancient Tamil and ancient Dravidian language literature, along with the discovery of the independent origin of Dravidian languages from Sanskrit, further helped build a counter-narrative.

C.N. Annadurai, another important idealogue of the Dravidian movement and the founder of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Dravidian party founded in 1949 and sought to enter electoral politics, also emphasized the dual identity of the worker.


### Dravidian politics and the economy


### Institutionalised populism of Dravidian politics

The Dravidian parties have a history of populist policy making in Tamil Nadu. Economic popular policies seek to address specific grievances of specific groups. Therefore, Social and Economic popular policies can be differentiated by both their intent and content.


### Democratisation of education

As of 2024, Tamil Nadu is the state with the highest education enrollment in India, with a gross enrollment ratio of 47%, surpassing the national average of 28.4%. The state has high levels of literacy across social groups and nearly 50 percent of youth finishing school enter tertiary education.

There exists an elite bias in the provision of public services such as health and education in India. Throughout India, higher and technical education, up till the 80s were developed at the expense of basic education. Lower classes and castes couldn't catch up and be represented in higher education due to the abysmal status of primary education. But socio-political changes in Tamil Nadu allowed it to buck this trend since there were heavy investments into universal primary education in the state until it was deemed sufficiently developed. Investments were then targeted at developing secondary education and then tertiary education.

The positive outcome in education is a result of a near century long mobilisation for equal access to education, allowing people to escape poverty and enter the modern economy. The state has also focused on inclusivity in higher education. There exists an extensive affirmative action program to ensure pupil from all communities are represented at tertiary education.
