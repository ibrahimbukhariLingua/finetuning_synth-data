Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)


# Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)



The **Serious Fraud Office** (**SFO**; Māori: *Te Tari Hara Tāware*) is the public service department of New Zealand charged with detecting, investigating and prosecuting financial crimes, including corruption, of a serious and complex nature.

The SFO is New Zealand's lead law enforcement agency for investigating and prosecuting serious financial crime, including bribery and corruption. The Auckland-based agency has about 50 employees of which 90 percent perform front-line activities. It has statutory independence as operational decisions are made without ministerial direction. The agency is based upon its UK counterpart as established by the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990. The SFO was established as a response to the collapse of the capital markets following the stock market crash in 1987.


## Investigation procedures

Suspects questioned by the SFO have no right to silence and must answer questions and produce requested evidence, even if it incriminates them. However, evidence at an interview cannot be used against a suspect at his or her trial, unless he or she gives evidence which contradicts their SFO interview. Witnesses can also be required to answer questions under compulsion. Such interviews enable people with confidentiality agreements with clients to speak freely to the SFO without fear of retribution from their clients. These provisions do not override legal professional privilege. Anyone who refuses to comply can be prosecuted and could be fined or jailed. Prosecutions are extremely rare and no one has been jailed for this offence.


## History

When set up under the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990, the responsible minister was the Attorney-General.

The Labour government announced in September 2007 that the SFO would be replaced by a new Organised Crime Agency. However, the bill to disband the SFO was delayed by the 2008 general election, and the new prime minister John Key informed Parliament that the SFO would not be disbanded.

In 2008, ministerial responsibility was transferred from the Attorney-General to the Minister of Police, to avoid a potential conflict of interest in the Attorney-General's roles.
