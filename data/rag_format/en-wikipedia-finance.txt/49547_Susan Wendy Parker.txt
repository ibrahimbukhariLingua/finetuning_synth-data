## Research

Parker's research spans a wide range of subjects, including behavioral and community health, education, policy and management, and international affairs.


### Evaluation of conditional cash transfer programs

A main area of Parker's research has been the evaluation of outcomes of the Mexican CCT program. She has studied the development, evaluation, and outcomes of the same program and highlighted how this research has contributed to the implementation of CCT initiatives in over sixty countries. Her investigation of the educational outcomes of the Progresa program focused on the impacts of educational scholarships and health components on children. The research also demonstrated how early nutritional interventions improved educational performance and increased the number of completed grades in schooling. She alongside Jere R. Behrman and Petra E. Todd assessed the medium-term impact of Progresa and employed both experimental as well as non-experimental methods to evaluate the program's effects on education and employment. The findings revealed positive outcomes, including reduced work among younger individuals, increased employment among older girls, and transitions from agricultural to nonagricultural jobs.

In 2023, Parker examined the medium-term effects of Progresa on demographic outcomes by analyzing nationwide administrative data indicating a significant decline in teenage fertility and highlighting the program's influence on family planning outcomes. She along with Tom Vogl investigated the long-term effects of childhood exposure to Progresa and found lasting impacts on women's outcomes in early adulthood, including educational attainment, geographic mobility, labor market performance, and household living standards.


### Social programs and policy participation

Parker has explored the nuances of human behavior in various contexts, shedding light on issues surrounding poverty alleviation, and social program participation. In collaborative research on misreporting in a poverty alleviation program, she alongside César Martinelli revealed that underreporting is common for items associated with desirability and social status. The study also calculated the costs of lying and embarrassment for different goods, showing that the embarrassment cost of not owning an item corresponds to its ownership rate among households. In her research on social program participation, she proposed a model of the participation process, highlighting that decisions at each stage are influenced by expectations about subsequent stages and that knowledge about the program significantly impacts participation outcomes. In another study, she investigated student cheating and cash incentives using data from a policy intervention, employing methods to quantify the extent of cheating.


### Health spending and education determinants

Parker has conducted various studies on health spending and performance incentives dynamics in education. In her research on household health spending in Mexico, she worked together with Rebeca Wong and discovered that lower-income, uninsured households are highly responsive to income changes, resulting in reduced healthcare expenses during economic challenges. She investigated Mexico's Seguro Popular health insurance program using Mexican Health and Aging Study data and revealed significant improvements in healthcare utilization as well as diagnostic tests. Her findings suggested that enhanced healthcare access in underserved areas can amplify the effects of health insurance. With Carla Pederzini, she presented empirical models to explore the determinants of education in Mexico and delved into the factors impacting the educational outcomes in context of gender differences. In 2015, she collaborated with Jere R. Behrman, Petra E. Todd, and Kenneth I. Wolpin to conduct experiments with three performance incentive programs in Mexican high schools and revealed how offering incentives to students, teachers, and administrators has significant impact in enhancing academic performance.
