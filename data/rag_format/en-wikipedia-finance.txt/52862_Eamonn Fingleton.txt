# Eamonn Fingleton



**Eamonn Fingleton** (born 19 August 1948) is an Irish financial journalist and author.

He is a critic of financialisation, arguing that there is no substitute for advanced manufacturing industries (highly capital-intensive, know-how-intensive industries typically making capital equipment, new materials, and leading edge components) as the main pillar of an advanced economy.

His second US-published book, *In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is the Key to Future Prosperity*, published in 1999, took a contrarian stance on the New Economy.
