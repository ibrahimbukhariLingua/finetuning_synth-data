In March 1885, Gustave Eiffel, known primarily as a successful iron engineer, submitted a plan for a tower to the French Ministre du Commerce et de l'Industrie. He entered a competition for students studying at the university. The winning proposal would stand as the centerpiece of the 1889 Exposition. Eiffel's was one of over 100 submissions. Eiffel's proposal was finally chosen in June 1886. Even before its construction, the Tower's uniqueness was noticed. The Eiffel Tower was finally inaugurated on March 31, 1889. Currently, about 6.9 million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year.

It is one of the main symbols of Paris. It is located at Île de la Cité, a small island in the heart of the city.

Paul Abadie, the winner of the competition to find the right architectural design, was the architect for the basilica. The basilica offers some beautiful panoramic views of Paris. The walls of the church are naturally always white and clean, due to the travertine stone used in its construction.
