Triple accreditation


# Triple accreditation



**Triple accreditation** (also known as the **triple crown**) refers to a business school being accredited by three international organizations: the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) in the US, the Association of MBAs (AMBA) in the UK, and EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) in Belgium.

While all three business school accrediting bodies operate globally, most business schools in the US choose to pursue only AACSB accreditation. A total of 136 business schools in the world are triple-accredited as of 23 January 2025ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ.


## Triple Accreditation Criteria

Each of the three institutions assesses a business school according to different criteria and scope:

* **AMBA** accreditation examines the Master of Business Administration (MBA) programme portfolio and is intended to show that this "demonstrates the highest standards in teaching, learning and curriculum design, career development and employability, student, alumni and employer interaction."
* **AACSB** accreditation looks at the whole business school and is intended to "signify a business school’s commitment to strategic management, learner success, thought leadership, and societal impact." There has been a greater emphasis on diversity and inclusion since the 2020 revision.
* **EQUIS** accreditation also looks at the whole business school, and is intended to "signal the school’s overall quality, viability and self-improvement commitment."

## Accredidation in the US

While all three business school accrediting bodies operate globally, most business schools in the US choose to pursue only AACSB accreditation. This preference is influenced by the perception within the US that AACSB accreditation is sufficient. Additionally, the structure of US business schools often does not align with the accreditation standards for AMBA or EQUIS. For example, US business school admissions often do not meet the UK's AMBA requirement that MBA students have a minimum of three years of work experience.
