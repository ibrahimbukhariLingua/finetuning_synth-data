**Jensen-Group NV** is a Belgium-based international company known for manufacturing machines for the heavy-duty laundry industry.


## History

Jensen-Group NV started as a repair shop for dairy equipment in 1937 when it was founded by Ejnar Jensen on the island of Bornholm in Baltic Sea, Denmark. In 1954 Ejnar Jensen's son Jørn Munch Jensen (1932–2012) took over the leadership of the company.

In 1960 the first folding machine developed by Jensen was installed at the Bornholm Laundry. In 1970, the company introduced the *Jenstack*: the first stacker ever during the era.

In early 1990's, Jensen acquired *AB Metric Interconveyor* (garment handling systems), *Futurail* (monorail systems) and *Senkingwerk*. In 2008, Jensen launched the *CleanTech* concept to enhance production.

Between 2015 and 2016, Jensen expanded its product portfolio with newer machines.

In 2020, the company experienced a slow down in activities as a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic,
but later continued normal productions in 2023 and beyond.
