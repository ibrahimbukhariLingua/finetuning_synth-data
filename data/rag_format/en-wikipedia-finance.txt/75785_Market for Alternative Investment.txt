Market for Alternative Investment


# Market for Alternative Investment



The **Market for Alternative Investment** (*MAI* or *mai*) is a stock exchange of Thailand which was established by the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) in 1998 under the Securities Exchange of Thailand Act as an alternative stock market for small and medium-sized enterprises. It officially commenced operation on 21 June 1999. It is located in Khlong Toei, Bangkok.

The mai operates independently under the supervision of the SET's board of directors. The mai committee sets its policies and oversees the market's operation and front office duties such as stock listing and public relations. Back office functions, such as the trading system, clearing and settlement procedures, trading surveillance and supervision, as well as disclosure requirements, will be based entirely on existing Stock Exchange of Thailand operations.
