Enterprise National Bank was acquired by a holding company, Enterprise Bancorp, Inc. in 2007. A new application to change the bank from a national charter to a state charter was submitted and approved in June 2008 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)] and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation.

In connection to the approved charter change, the bank changed its official name from Enterprise National Bank of Palm Beach to Enterprise Bank of Florida.
