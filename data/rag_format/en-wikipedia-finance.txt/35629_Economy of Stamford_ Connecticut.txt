The **economy of Stamford, Connecticut** is robust and is considered an anomaly for having a large number of corporate headquarters in a city of its size. In the 1980s and 90s, Stamford had the third highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the country, with 18 companies headquartered in the city. The only two cities that had higher concentrations in the nation were New York City and Chicago.

In 2017, the city had four Fortune 500 Companies, nine Fortune 1000 Companies, as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. In addition to the North American headquarters of Royal Bank of Scotland and a major office of UBS, many specialized hedge funds, asset managers and trading houses are localized in and around the city. This gives Stamford the largest financial district in New York Metro outside New York City itself and one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the nation.

In recent years, various digital media corporations have moved to Stamford as a less expensive place to do production while having easy access to both New York City and Boston. Corporations include NBCUniversal, NBC Sports Group, WWE, A+E Networks, The People's Court, YES Network, ITV America, This Old House, Charter Communications, Thomson Reuters, and Meredith Corporation.
