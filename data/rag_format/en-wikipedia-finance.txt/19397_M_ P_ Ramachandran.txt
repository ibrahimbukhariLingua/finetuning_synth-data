## Career

In 1971, he started working as an accountant while getting a post graduation in financial management in Bombay (now Mumbai). Since his childhood, Ramachandran had washed his own clothes but was dissatisfied with fabric whiteners results. One day he got a chemical industry journal that talked about "*purple-colored dyes helping textile makers get the most brilliant shades of white*". The phrase ignited an idea. Ramachandran experimented in his kitchen for a year–boiling, diluting and testing–until he was pleased with the results.

In 1983, a brother lent him ₹5,000 (less than US$60) to set up a makeshift factory on family land in Kerala. He named his firm Jyothy after his first daughter. In the first year, sales totaled ₹40,000 (US$500 today) and profits were US$18.
