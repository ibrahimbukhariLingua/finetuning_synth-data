### Obama administration

On January 6, 2011, President Barack Obama named Daley as his next White House Chief of Staff, and he took office on January 13, 2011. Daley succeeded Rahm Emanuel, who served as chief of staff during the first two years of the president's term and left the position in October 2010 to run to succeed Daley's brother as Mayor of Chicago, and Pete Rouse, who was serving as the interim chief of staff.

In March 2011, speaking for the Obama administration on *Meet the Press*, Daley said the administration would consider using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if rising oil prices caused by Arab Spring threaten the U.S. economy. Daley said Obama "is very concerned; we're trying to look at all the possible options." He repeated the administration's stance that there is enough output capacity in the world to deal with any disruptions from Libya.

### Post-Obama administration

Just after the 2012 presidential election, in the November 8, 2012, issue of the *Chicago Tribune*, Daley was reported as considering a run in the 2014 election for Governor of Illinois. Daley said "I've thought about it before and I don't take it off the table. I think right now, to be very frank with you, the last thing in the world anybody wants to hear about is a race that's two years down the road."ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Daley further was quoted as saying: "I'm not closing the door and, I know that sounds like a politician, but the fact of the matter is that these are tough days and I think there's a lot to be done by the Legislature. I don't think it helps right now for people to be out there saying they're going to run and they have a solution at this point. I think we've got to see what the Legislature does."ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ


#### 2014 Illinois gubernatorial campaign

On June 10, 2013, Daley announced via YouTube that he would launch an exploratory committee to run for Governor of Illinois. On July 2, 2013, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Daley for governor. On July 30, 2013, Daley filed documents declaring himself an official candidate to challenge incumbent Governor Pat Quinn in the 2014 Democratic primary. On September 16, 2013, Daley made a surprise announcement that he was exiting the race due to the personal hardships inherent in running a campaign for elected office.

After the election, Bill Daley served as co-chair of the transition team for the incoming Rauner Administration.

In 2018, Daley served as the head of finances for the campaign of gubernatorial candidate Chris Kennedy.


#### 2019 Chicago mayoral campaign

After two-term mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he would not seek reelection, it was reported on September 14, 2018, that Daley would run for mayor of Chicago.

Daley's candidacy made the 2019 election the fourteenth Chicago mayoral election in which a member of his family has been a candidate. William's father won the 1955, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1971, and the 1975 elections. His brother won the 1989, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, and the 2007 elections, and was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1983 election. This means that a member of the Daley family participated in all but four of the eighteen Chicago mayoral elections held between 1955 and 2019 (with no member of the Daley family having run in the 1979, 1987, 2011, or the 2015 elections).

Among the positions Daley took was support of the city exploring the potential implementation of a commuter tax. He also proposed reducing the size of the Chicago City Council from 50 members to 15.

Daley was one of four mayoral candidates (alongside Gery Chico, Susana Mendoza, and Toni Preckwinkle) that had ties to Alderman Edward M. Burke, whose corruption scandal upended the race for mayor. However, Daley's ties were weaker than the other three, and thus, he was perceived to have suffered the least amount of damage from the scandal of the four.

Daley carried support from the city's business community.

Daley's campaign received endorsements from the editorial boards of the Chicago Tribune, Crain's Chicago Business, and The Chicago Crusader. He received the endorsement of Plumbers Local Union 130 He also received endorsements from politicians Al Gore, Emil Jones, Joseph P. Kennedy II, and Bobby Rush.

Daley's campaign placed an emphasis on fundraising. Daley vastly out-fundraised his opponents. A significant financial contributor to Daley's campaign was Illinois billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin. Griffin's financial support of Daley's campaign proved controversial for Daley, largely because Griffin had also been a major financial backer of the failed 2018 reelection campaign of Republican former Illinois governor Bruce Rauner.

Daley's strong fundraising enabled him to run highly visible advertising.

Daley ran a weaker field operation than some other candidates did.

In the last several weeks of the campaign, Daley began to rise in the polls. However, he also began to be the subject of attack ads run by the union-affiliated Fight Back for a Better Tomorrow Super PAC. At the end of the election campaign, polls showed Daley having strong prospects of finishing near the top of the field.

Daley placed third in the election, failing to advance to the runoff. He won 82,294 votes, 14.78% the overall votes cast in the first round. The margin between him and second-place finisher Toni Preckwinkle was 7,049 votes.


## Personal life

In 2010, Daley married Bernadette Keller. Keller is an organ donor. She is a founding member and director of the Chicago Transplant Ethics Consortium.

In 2006, Keller bought a 2,052-square-foot apartment in the Park Tower on North Michigan Avenue for $1.48 million. The couple sold the unit in 2015 for $1.4 million. They currently live in a four-bedroom condo on North Lake Shore Drive.

He has four children. His three adult children and three granddaughters all live in Chicago.
