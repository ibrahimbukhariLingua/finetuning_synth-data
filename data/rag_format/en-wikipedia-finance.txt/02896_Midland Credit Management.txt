## Lawsuits, fines and controversies

In 2013, the Southern District Court of New York ruled that Midland had the right to charge the same interest rate as charged by the bank that made the loan, finding that the terms of the loan were legally "valid when made". In 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Southern District Court's decision, ruling that Midland Credit Management did not qualify for usury protection.

After the Supreme Court of the United States refused to review the case in 2016, the Second Circuit Court ruled in 2019 that Midland Credit Management was not protected under the National Bank Act. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a final rule to address the legal uncertainties caused by the Second Circuit Court of Appeal's decision and codified "valid when made".

In September 2015, Midland Credit Management entered into a consent order with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding violations to the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In 2020, the CFPB filed a suit alleging the company violated the terms of the consent order. The suit was settled with a $15 million civil money penalty.
