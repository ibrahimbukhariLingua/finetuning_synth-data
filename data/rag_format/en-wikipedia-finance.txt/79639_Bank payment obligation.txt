Bank payment obligation


# Bank payment obligation



**Bank payment obligation** (**BPO**) is a class of settlement solution in international supply chain finance.

The solution is championed by SWIFT and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Banking Commission as a means to move away from letter of credit schemes toward "support[ing] the development of a globally accepted standardised environment and establishment of the BPO as a neutral industry-wide practice".


## History

The *International Chamber of Commerce (Banking Commission) Bank Payments Obligation Working Group* (ICC-BPO) held its first meeting in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland in March 2011 with the participation of nine banks. The ICC Banking Commission and SWIFT developed the *Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligations* (URBPO), which were launched on 24 June 2013.
