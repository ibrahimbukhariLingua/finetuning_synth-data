With Schultz as CEO, Darty's stores were digitalized and the new pricing strategy supported Darty in better competing against low-cost offering. Customer service was revolutionized with same-day delivery and the company launched the 'Darty button' - a home device that connects customers to Darty. Darty franchise program aimed to target least densely populated areas and the multi channel strategy development had a major impact on Darty's sales.
