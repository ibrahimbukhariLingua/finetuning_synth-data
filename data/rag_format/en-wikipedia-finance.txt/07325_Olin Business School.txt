## History

Founded in 1917, the business school was renamed for entrepreneur John M. Olin in 1988.

The Olin Business School includes the 80,000 sq ft (7,400 m²) Simon Hall, whose 1986 construction was largely funded by a gift from John E. Simon; Knight and Bauer Halls, whose 2014 construction was largely funded by gifts from Charles F. And Joanne Knight and George and Carol Bauer; and the Charles F. Knight Executive Education and Conference Center, all on the Danforth Campus.

On July 1, 2009, the school took over management of the Brookings Institute's executive management program.


## Programs


### Undergraduate degree


#### BSBA Program

At Olin, undergraduate students are admitted directly into the BSBA program as freshmen. Inter-division transfers are allowed for students who are in good standing with their current division, can complete the BSBA requirements within 4 years, have completed 2 or more core professional business courses for credit, have completed Calculus II for credit, and have a minimum 3.5 GPA.

To graduate, students must complete a minimum of 120 units of coursework. 40% of classes must be outside the areas of business. Students can choose from eight different business majors: Accounting, Economics and Strategy, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Healthcare Management, Marketing, Organization and Strategic Management, and Supply Chain, Operations, and Technology. Olin students can also minor in International Business, the Business of the Arts, the Business of Entertainment, or the Business of Sports Management.

Students declare their business administration major (or majors) during their sophomore year. Students can also earn a second major or minor from one of the university's other schools, such as the College of Arts & Sciences, School of Engineering & Applied Science, or Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts.

Non-business students from other WUSTL schools also can minor in the following business fields: Accounting, Business Economics, Business of Sports, Business of the Arts, Entrepreneurship, Finance, General Business, Healthcare Management, International Business, Leadership, Marketing, Operations and Supply Chain Management, and Strategy.


### Masters degree


#### MBA Program

Olin has four main rounds and after June they have rolling admissions.

Olin's Full-Time MBA program was named the #4 global MBA program for women in the *Financial Times* (2018). In 2019, the class reached near-gender parity with 49% female students. In October 2019, an Inc. Magazine ranking powered by Poets&Quants ranked Olin as the #1 MBA program in the world for entrepreneurship. In January 2020, Olin was named the Poets&Quants MBA Program of 2019 as a result of a series of radical changes to the program focusing on global immersion.

Students in the full-time MBA program experience three global immersions in the first year of their experience. Students begin with an orientation in St. Louis before spending time in Washington, DC learning about the intersection of business and policy. They then spend time in two international locations; in 2022 the immersion included Barcelona, consulting with local wineries, then Paris, and lastly Santiago, Chile where student teams evaluated production capacity and bottlenecks at three firms.

The MBA curriculum requires completion of 67 credit hours, nearly two-thirds of which are elective courses selected by the student. The fall semester of year one focuses on critical thinking, leadership, career strategy, and the major functional areas of business. During the spring semester of year one and throughout year two, students take mostly elective courses of their choosing, often following the guidelines of platforms and concentration areas that help students navigate the curriculum toward their career goals. Platforms offered include:

* Consulting
* Corporate Finance and Investments
* Entrepreneurship
* Marketing
* Operations and Supply Chain Management
