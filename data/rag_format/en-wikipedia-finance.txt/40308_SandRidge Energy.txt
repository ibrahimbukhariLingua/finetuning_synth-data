## Environmental impact

Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity produced by injected wastes, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, due to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in injection well volumes and pressures. SandRidge, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Southcentral Kansas, appealed the order.
