**Equal Exchange Trading** is a UK-based alternative trading organisation. Equal Exchange is a worker's cooperative distributing food and beverage products in the independent natural food sector. The organization's origins stretch back to 1979 "when three voluntary workers returned to Edinburgh after working on aid projects in various parts of Africa."

Over 90% of the company's products are both Organic and Fairtrade.
