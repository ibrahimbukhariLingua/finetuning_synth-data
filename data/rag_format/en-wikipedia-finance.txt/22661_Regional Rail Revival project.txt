Regional Rail Revival project


# Regional Rail Revival project



The **Regional Rail Revival** is a joint initiative between the Australian federal government and the Victorian state government to upgrade all regional railway lines in Victoria. The project has an estimated total cost of A$4 billion. A$2.3 billion of the project's total cost is being funded by the Australian Government. It was delivered by Rail Projects Victoria (RPV) until April 2024, and then by the Level Crossing Removal Project. The project is guided by the 2016 Regional Network Development Plan, which outlines the short, medium and long-term priorities for a modernised regional rail network.


## History

The Regional Rail Revival (RRR) project in Victoria has been a significant endeavor in the realm of state infrastructure, unfolding over several years with contributions from both state and federal governments. This project's history begins in earnest during the late 2010s, with its complexities rooted in policy decisions, funding allocations, and the practicalities of rail infrastructure development.

In the earlier years of this decade, the need for revitalising Victoria's regional rail network was becoming increasingly apparent. The lines connecting Melbourne to regional centers like Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, Gippsland, and Warrnambool were showing signs of wear, with services that were slower, less frequent, and sometimes unreliable compared to urban rail networks. This situation was a product of many years of underinvestment, a trend that had begun in the late 20th century as the focus shifted to road transport.

The federal Liberal/National government under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2017 initiated a policy direction that would have profound effects on regional rail in Victoria. Through the Asset Recycling Initiative, the federal government aimed to incentivise states to sell public assets and reinvest the proceeds into infrastructure projects. This was part of a broader strategy where economic growth was seen as closely tied to infrastructure development. Victoria, under the Labor government led by Premier Daniel Andrews, was quick to engage with this initiative, seeing an opportunity to address the long-standing issues with its regional rail.

The announcement of a $1.7 billion investment for Victoria's regional rail network was a pivotal moment. This funding was to be spread across multiple lines, with detailed plans for each:

Ballarat Line: Received $557 million for track duplication, new passing loops, and station upgrades to reduce travel times significantly.

Bendigo Line: Allocated $91 million, focusing on improving both passenger and freight services, acknowledging Bendigo's growing economic significance.

Geelong Line: Slated for $110 million to improve connectivity between Melbourne and Victoria's second-largest city.

Gippsland Line: With $530 million, aiming to address what was often described as one of the state's most problematic rail services.

Warrnambool Line: Given $114 million for upgrades to increase capacity and reliability, particularly important for the agriculturally rich south-west region.

This era was marked by a cooperative effort between the federal LNP (Liberal/National Party) government and the state Labor government, where political differences were set aside for the sake of infrastructure development. The deal was not only about funding but also about policy alignment, particularly with the Inland Rail project, which aimed to connect Melbourne to Brisbane. The strategic alignment of these projects under Turnbull's leadership provided a framework for how regional and national infrastructure initiatives could work together.

As the project moved into implementation, the Victorian government took the lead on the ground. This involved extensive consultations with local communities, businesses, and transport experts to tailor the upgrades to specific regional needs. The process was bureaucratic, involving environmental assessments, heritage considerations, and logistical planning for construction phases that would minimally disrupt existing services.

Following Turnbull, the Morrison government continued to support the initiative, with the LNP maintaining a policy focus on infrastructure. This continuity in policy from one LNP leader to another helped ensure that the funding and support for the RRR did not waver, despite changes in the federal leadership.

The transition to the 2020s saw further developments. Even as political landscapes changed, with a federal Labor government taking over, the commitment to the RRR project remained, albeit with different emphases. The federal Labor government, while having its own priorities, recognised the foundational work done by their predecessors and the ongoing benefits of the project. This period was about fine-tuning, ensuring that projects were completed, and looking forward to how these rail improvements could integrate with other transport modes and environmental goals.
