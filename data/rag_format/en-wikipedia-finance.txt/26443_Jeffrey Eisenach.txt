## Controversies

In the 1990s, Eisenach was a close associate of Newt Gingrich. He headed GOPAC, and later the Progress and Freedom Foundation, which Gingrich used to raise tax-exempt funds for his Renewing American Civilization campaign. Speaker Gingrich was later reprimanded by the House of Representatives by a vote of 395-28 and fined $300,000 for providing untrue information to a House Ethics Committee investigation of the matter.

In 2016, *The New York Times* found that Eisenach advocated against proposed net neutrality regulations in his capacity as an American Enterprise Institute (AEI) visiting scholar, including publishing AEI working papers, inviting FCC officials to speak out against net neutrality at both private and public AEI events, and testifying before congress regarding the potential harms of net neutrality using his AEI title, while simultaneously working as a paid consultant for Verizon and Verizon's trade association, GSMA. The report found that Eisenach rarely disclosed this conflict of interest in his policy work as a scholar at AEI.
