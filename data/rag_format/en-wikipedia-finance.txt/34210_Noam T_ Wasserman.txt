He received the Innovation in Entrepreneurship Pedagogy Award from the Academy of Management in 2010 for "Founders’ Dilemmas", a "second-year M.B.A. elective course" at the HBS. The course asks students if they plan on starting their own businesses after the HBS, and highlights what interpersonal issues they may encounter.

Wasserman is the author of *The Founder’s Dilemmas: Anticipating and Avoiding the Pitfalls That Can Sink a Startup*. The book is based on data on "10,000 founders from 3,500 start-ups" assembled by Wasserman. It was reviewed in the *Family Business Review*.

Wasserman draws a distinction between chief executive officers who are "Kings" and want to keep their job at all costs, and those who are "Rich" and don't mind stepping down if this leads to more profit-making for the company. While Wasserman writes about business corporations, Mark Charendoff, the president of the Maimonides Fund applies this dichotomy to philanthropic gifts, arguing that donors should ask themselves if the CEOs of non-profit organizations are more interested in the results derived from their donations, or in their own careerist self-interest.

On March 4, 2019, it was announced that Wasserman would become the dean of the Sy Syms School of Business at Yeshiva University. His position took effect in May 2019.
