## Education

The AFAANZ Doctoral Education Network (AFDEN) aims to assist doctoral candidates in accounting and finance and related fields throughout their first year of study. AFDEN helps with the costs of pursuing a doctorate by awarding scholarships to successful applicants that are intended to be used for travel costs associated with attending necessary coursework at international universities. Although AFDEN doesn't claim to grant degrees or its own coursework, they offer a network for accounting and finance doctoral candidates to interact throughout the Australian and New Zealand regions. The program aims to prepare high quality dissertations and find a suitable academic career path.

AFAANZ also run a doctoral symposium to facilitate the work of PhD candidates. The symposium allows candidates to present an overview of their research and receive feedback from other doctoral students and professors in their respective fields.

In 2020 AFAANZ partnered with the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) to create the Education Technology Symposium from November 19 to November 20. The forum is interactive and held virtually for those interested in teaching via technology and expanding their technological skills in their classes.
