# The Euro and the Battle of Ideas



***The Euro and the Battle of Ideas*** is a book by Markus Brunnermeier, Professor of Economics at Princeton University; Harold James, Professor of History at Princeton University; and Jean-Pierre Landau, a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, a member of the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The book is about the philosophical differences between countries in the European Union, particularly Germany and France, and how their contrasting outlooks on political philosophy have shaped the Eurozone. The book also provides context to how the ideas that led to the creation of the European Union have influenced and been influenced by ideas in the United States, the United Kingdom, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Central Bank (ECB).


## Summary

The book begins with the historical roots of German-French differences, highlighting the cultural and philosophical aspects which distinguish the two nations. Their divergent systems of philosophical thoughts have spurred differences in economic ideologies in regards to federalism versus centralism, monetary and fiscal policies, and austerity versus stimulus. The authors argue that "there is no single, coherent economic philosophy within Europe. Rather, different nations have retained their own distinct economic philosophers and view European-level institutions--and ways to improve them--in this light." The books continus with an analysis on how these philosophies have manifested themselves in the European Union, mainly through the Maastricht negotiations and the commitment to a currency union. They expound upon the divergent ideas of economics and politics have contributed to different models of governance within Europe, and that "the German view and the French view actually need each other to be sustainable."
