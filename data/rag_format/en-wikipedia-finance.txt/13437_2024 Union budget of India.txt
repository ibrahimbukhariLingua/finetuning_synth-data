### Angel tax

The government has abolished the "angel tax," a levy that was introduced in the Finance Act of 2012. This tax applied to investments received by unlisted companies that exceeded the fair market value of their shares, often affecting start-ups and early-stage companies.


### Capital gains tax

The capital gains tax structure has also undergone changes:

* **Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):** The tax rate on short-term capital gains from shares, mutual funds, and real estate has been increased from 15% to 20%.
* **Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):** The tax rate on long-term capital gains has been set at 12.5%. Additionally, the exemption limit for long-term capital gains has been raised from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.25 lakh.

### Tax Deducted at Source

The government has proposed a reduction in the rate of Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) for various types of payments. Specifically:

* The TDS rate for insurance commission, life insurance policy payments, rent payments, and commission or brokerage payments is proposed to be decreased from 5% to 2%.
* The TDS rate on payments made by e-commerce operators to e-commerce participants for the sale of goods or services is set to be reduced from 1% to 0.1%.

The Secretary of Revenue, Sanjay Malhotra said that the decrease in TDS is aimed at simplifying TDS compliance.
