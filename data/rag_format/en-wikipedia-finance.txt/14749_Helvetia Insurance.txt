## History


### Founding of the predecessors from 1858

In 1858, Helvetia was established by Eastern Swiss business people and entrepreneurs as *Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft Helvetia* in St. Gallen. It was the first company in Switzerland to offer an insurance against risks of transport by land, river, and sea. Three years later, the private insurance company *Helvetia Feuer* was established in St Gallen. The occasion was the fire of Glarus, which revealed shortcomings in the building insurance system. Until 1887, both companies were jointly managed. The independent cooperative *Helvetia Unfall* was founded in 1894.


### Expansion from 1862

Over the course of its history, Helvetia expanded into all five continents and thereby laid the foundation for its business activities outside of Switzerland. In 1862, *Helvetia Feuer* established its first branches in Germany and expanded from 1876 into the US, where it opened branches in California and New York. Between 1920 and 1962, additional Helvetia subsidiaries were set up in France, Italy, Greece (sold in 1997), the Netherlands (sold in 1995) and Canada (sold in 1999). In Austria, the history of Helvetia goes back to the establishment of *Der Anker, Gesellschaft von Lebens- und Rentenversicherung* in 1858. Until 2006, *Helvetia Austria* also operated under this name. The establishment of subsidiaries in Spain, Italy and Germany took place between 1986 and 1988.


### Corporate consolidation in the second half of the 20th century

In the years after 1945, the goal of all major Swiss insurers was to become an all-sector company. In this context, *Helvetia Transport* became a subsidiary of *Helvetia Feuer* in 1961, and the merger followed in 1974. In 1968, *Helvetia Unfall* and *Helvetia Leben* merged and the insurance group has been offering the entire product range of life and non-life insurance since then.

In this constellation, it was not possible for *Helvetia Feuer* to enter the field of accident liability and automotive insurance, as this was operated by *Helvetia Unfall*. The same applied in reverse for *Helvetia Unfall* with its subsidiary *Helvetia Leben*. *Helvetia Feuer* and *Helvetia Unfall* hindered each other "with their common name and saw their freedom of movement restricted in view of the transition to an all-sector society". An agreement between *Helvetia Feuer* and *Helvetia Unfall* followed. Closer cooperation was sought, but the independence of both partner companies was preserved. As a result, *Helvetia Feuer* cooperated with *Helvetia Unfall* between 1968 and 1988 by creating dual shares.

In 1986, *Helvetia Feuer* and *Helvetia Unfall* started to separate from their partnership. On 11 October 1988, the shareholders decided in an extraordinary general meeting of *Helvetia Feuer* and *Helvetia Unfall* to completely separate the two partner companies. *Helvetia Feuer* was renamed as *Helvetia Versicherungen* and the company received a new mission statement and branding. The three-dimensional triangular symbol was introduced. *Helvetia Unfall* took the name of its travel insurance subsidiary *Elvia* (now part of *Allianz Global Assistance*). One year later, *Helvetia Insurance* in Switzerland branched out to include the accident, liability and motor vehicle sectors.


### Helvetia and Patria

In 1991, Erich Walser was appointed as general director of the group. Among other things, he was hired to implement a new strategy that enabled the development from a non-life insurer to an all-line insurance group. In 1996, the company cooperated with the long-standing Basel-based life insurer *Patria*. The beginnings of *Patria* go back to the establishment of *Basler Sterbe- und Alters-Kasse* in 1878. The charitable pension fund was the first to insure the life of socially disadvantaged people with the aim of being an actual national insurer. After numerous changes in name and mergers, *Schweizerische Lebensversicherungsgesellschaft Patria* was established in 1910. In 1992, *Helvetia* and *Patria* decided to develop the Swiss market jointly in the future and enter into a strategic alliance; joint management began in 1994. In June 1996, the companies have been merged and established as *Helvetia Patria*.


### Market consolidation in the 1990s

The aim of the new company structure established in 1996 was to strengthen the market positions in the core countries of Switzerland, Germany and Austria as well as in the two southern European markets of Italy and Spain. *Alte Leipziger*, for example, took a 10% stake in *Helvetia Patria's* share capital. Through its cooperation with *Alte Leipziger*, *Helvetia Patria* transacted business in the areas of health insurance, legal protection insurance and building society savings with companies in the *Alte Leipziger Group* in Germany. In 2001, *Alte Leipziger* sold its shares again. As a result, the Swiss Association of Raiffeisenbanken became a new shareholder in the *Helvetia Patria Group* with a two percent share. The cooperation with the *Raiffeisen group* was subsequently expanded.

In Austria, *Der Anker, Gesellschaft von Lebens- und Rentenversicherung* became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1993. In Italy, *Helvetia Patria* took over *Nordstern Danni* in 1998 and acquired *Norwich Union Vita* in 2001. In 2005, the group bought the insurance portfolio of *Sofid Vita* and three years later they acquired *Padana Assicurazioni* and the majority of *Chiara Vita*. In Spain, at the end of 1998, *Helvetia Patria* acquired the northern Spanish *La Vasco Navarra LVN*, a medium-sized all-sector company. In 2000, the takeover of *Previsión Española* was completed. In 2003, the two companies merged into *Helvetia Previsión*, based in Seville. The position in the transport insurance area was expanded through the purchase of the transport insurance area of the cooperation partner *Royal & Sun Alliance* in 2002 and further acquisitions. *Helvetia Patria* withdrew completely from the Netherlands, Greece and Canada by 2000.


### Acquisition, internationalization and diversification

Since 2006, the corporate group has appeared under the *Helvetia* brand in all countries. In 2010, Helvetia bought the Swiss insurers *Alba Allgemeine Versicherungs-Gesellschaft AG* *(Alba)* and *Phenix Lebensversicherungsgesellschaft AG* *(Phenix)*. The *Alba/Phenix* range in sickness/accident insurance was sold to the two insurance companies *Innova* and *Solida*.

In 2014, *Nationale Suisse* and Austria's subsidiary of *Bâloise* were taken over. For this acquisition, Helvetia increased its stake in *Nationale Suisse* to more than 98 per cent and then initiated the procedure to declare the remaining shares void. *Nationale Suisse* consisted of *smile.direct*, Switzerland's leading online insurer. It also became part of Helvetia Group with the takeover. The acquisition was one of the biggest insurance takeover in recent years in Switzerland.

In 2016, Helvetia took over 70 per cent of the shares in the online mortgage broker *MoneyPark*. The purchase price was about 107 million francs. With this majority stake, Helvetia entered the Swiss mortgage business.

At the beginning of 2017, the company announced that it would invest in startups, which support the transformation of the existing core business or develop new business models, via their own venture fund. The fund is endowed with some CHF 55 million and plans to invest in some 25 new companies. Among other things, the venture fund has invested in Volocopter, *Flatfox*, *Pricehubble*, *Baufi24.de* or in the Insurtech *Inzmo*.


### Recent developments

With the takeover of *Caser* in 2020, the group entered the health & care sector, as *Caser* operated six hospitals and around 24 dental clinics as well as retirement and nursing homes in addition to the insurance business. In the same year, the company founded *Helvetia Asset Management AG*, through which it sold services and investments in the real estate sector. The company's first real estate fund was set up in April 2020. Further capital increases followed, as a result of which the fund had 47 properties with a market value of around CHF 1.09 billion as of 1 April 2023.

In 2022, Helvetia Group entered into a partnership with *Migros Bank* for the sale of car insurance. Via the subsidiary *Medicall AG*, Helvetia Group coordinates the evacuation of accidents and the towing of the Canton Basel-Landschaft. Since March 2022, *Helvetia Liechtenstein* has been operating under the name *Helvetia Global Solutions* (HGS). At the end of 2022, Helvetia Group started the internationalization of the online insurer *Smile* and introduced it to the Austrian market, followed by the introduction to the Spanish market in 2023.


## Group Executive Board and Board of Directors

Helvetia is managed by an executive board of nine people. Fabian Rupprecht had been its chairman since 1 October 2023.

The board of directors has ten members and Thomas Schmuckli was elected as chairman at the General Assembly in April 2022.


## International activities

The group is divided into three segments, in which the European and Swiss segments together make up 80 per cent of the business volume.
