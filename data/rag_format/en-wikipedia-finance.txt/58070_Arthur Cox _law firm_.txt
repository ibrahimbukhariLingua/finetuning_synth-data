## History

Arthur Cox & Co commenced practice in 1920 at 5 St Stephen's Green, in a premises shared with JS Evans & Co. Ltd. There were two partners – Arthur Cox and John McArevey. The firm initially benefitted from instructions from Sir Horace Plunkett, South Dublin Unionist Party MP, who Cox had met through a friend's membership of The Arts Club. This was despite Cox's father's close friendship with John Dillon, who had been a lifelong opponent of Plunkett's. The firm was involved in certain aspects of the negotiations of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, with Cox claiming to have traveled to London by mail boat on eight occasions. The principal business of the firm in its early years was Cox assisting his University College Dublin friends, Ministers Kevin O'Higgins, Patrick Hogan, Patrick McGilligan, who were engaged in the building of the Irish Free State. In 1922, the firm was instructed by the first Attorney General of Ireland, Hugh Kennedy, to prepare an opinion on the legal status of the Irish Free State in the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, with Cox having been part of the delegation sent to London in 1921 to negotiate the terms of the treaty, whereas Kennedy had not been, to the regret of Michael Collins.
