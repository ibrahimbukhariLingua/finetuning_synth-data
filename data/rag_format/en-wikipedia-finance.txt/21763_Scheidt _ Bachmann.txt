The company has four business divisions and is represented internationally by numerous subsidiaries and partners in around 50 countries. The company provides railway signalling systems, solutions for parking management and fuel or energy retail systems as well as systems for tickets for public transport.

Scheidt & Bachmann was founded in 1872 and has its own production plants where a great amount of products are manufactured in-house.


## History

Friedrich Scheidt and Carl Bachmann founded Scheidt & Bachmann in Mönchengladbach in 1872, initially manufacturing steam engines and textile manufacturing equipment. At the end of the 1870s, production expanded to create mechanical signals for railroad systems which lead to the foundation of the first business division: Signalling Systems.In 1896, Scheidt & Bachmann was granted its first patent for a "drive device for barriers". In 1932, it took advantage of the favourable market situation, and expanded into the manufacture of tank systems and petrol pumps.

By 1966, the company began designing and producing systems for multi-storey car parks, launching its parking management division and incorporating emerging microprocessor technology. Around the same time, Scheidt & Bachmann developed parking fee-collection systems featuring barriers at parking lot entrances, where users could obtain magnetic tickets or use credit cards to enter and pay at self-service or staffed cashier stations, with fees calculated upon exit. In 1978 the Fare Collection Systems division was established.

Over the years, the company has become a system supplier of intelligent mobility solutions and has been able to expand its market share. In 1995, the first subsidiaries were set up in the USA and Slovakia. Numerous other subsidiaries were established worldwide in the years that followed. In 2017, Scheidt & Bachmann began to offer cloud solutions, because faster data lines made cloud-bass systems feasible.

In 2022 the company celebrated its 150th anniversary. The expansion of cloud-based systems is planned for the future. The topic of IoT (Internet of Things) will also play a role.
