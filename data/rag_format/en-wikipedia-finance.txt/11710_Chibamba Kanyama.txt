## Controversies

In July 2018, Chibamba Twitted that the IMF was ‘withdrawing its resident representative to Zambia, Alfredo Baldini, something that had not happened except for two African countries and that a replacement would take a while.’ This generated a lot of condemnation by members of the ruling Patriotic Front (PF), who published articles on both social and mainstream media, claiming Chibamba had lied. The President of the Economic Association of Zambia, aligned to the ruling party, Lubinda Haabazoka issued a social media statement disowning Chibamba that he was not an economist.

Chibamba later apologized for the tweet through the Times of Zambia and Zambia Daily Mail after the Minister of Finance Margaret Mwanakatwe engaged him so as to calm the situation. The IMF resident representative, Baldini, still left Zambia the same month and the country had to do without an IMF resident representative for four years. The issue of Chibamba not being an economist emerged a few years later following another statement in which he supported an IMF programme for Zambia under the new regime of the United Party for National Development (UPND). The Minister of Finance and National Planning Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane quickly issued a statement claiming Chibamba was his student in economics at the University of Zambia. Chibamba also responded via social media to clarify his academic credentials.
