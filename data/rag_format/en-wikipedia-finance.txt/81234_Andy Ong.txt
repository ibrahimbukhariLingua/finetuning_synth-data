## Career


### Asia Financial Planning Journal

Upon graduation from university, Ong worked as a managing editor at a publishing firm until he was retrenched in the 1997 financial crisis. Following this, he founded the financial journal Asia Financial Planning Journal, which broke even within 2 weeks. Ong sold the business in 2003 to focus on developing ERC.


### Entrepreneur's Resource Centre

In 2001, Ong founded incubator and business consultancy, Entrepreneur's Resource Centre (ERC). ERC was to be a hub to train, fund and mentor entrepreneurs in Singapore. ERC was awarded a grant by Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) under the SEEDS programme to incubate firms.

BIGWork offers entrepreneurs a co-working space and community at lower costs.


### BIGFund

ERC now has a presence in various countries such as Singapore, Thailand and China and an ERC Institute campus in Vietnam.


## Investments

He once assisted an ailing quick service food company that was on the verge of closing down because of cash flow problems due to over-expansion. It was at this time that Ong entered as a consultant and purchased a stake in the company and reformatted the food chain's entire marketing plan. In just 3 weeks, with an adjustment in awareness campaigns and budget, they made a profit.

## Legal Controversies

In January 2013, Sakae Holdings filed a suit against Ong for allegedly breaching duties when he was a non-executive director of the company, among other allegations. This came about when an international accounting firm commissioned by Sakae's executive chairman and CEO Douglas Foo to investigate Griffin Real Estate Investment Holdings. The firm reported that transactions had not been properly disclosed to Sakae and Foo, who is also the company's representative on Griffin's board.

In February 2013, the Sakae board asked Ong to tender his resignation within seven days. In a statement on 19 February 2013, Ong rejected the allegations and explained the use of the S$34 million in question. On 3 May 2013, Sakae withdrew the application to sue Ong and Ho Yew Kong, both former directors of Griffin, on behalf of Griffin. Following the withdrawal, Sakae was ordered by the court to pay more than $100,000 in legal costs and other fees relating to the two lawsuits it dropped.

Sakae filed a separate suit in April 2013 against Ong and 2 other men for breaching his fiduciary duties, including siphoning funds of $26 million from Griffon Real Estate Investment Holdings, of which Sakae was a minority shareholder. On 8 April 2017, the courts found against the 3 men and ordered them to pay $35million to Griffon, and Ong was ordered to pay $2.64 million to Sakae. On 3 August 2018, Ong, with 3 other men, was again taken to court over criminal breach of trust offenses committed between 2011 and 2016, including allegedly transferring $8million to his personal accounts and an unauthorized transfer of $15.8 million. Ong was offered bail at $700,000.
