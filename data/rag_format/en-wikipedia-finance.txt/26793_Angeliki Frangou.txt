As of December 2014, Navios Group controls 149 dry bulk carriers, 50 tankers and 12 container vessels. Between 2004 and 2014, "the Navios group has raised a shade under $10bn in financing - $6.3bn from the capital markets and 3.6bn from bank debt". Angeliki Frangou demonstrates an acute ability to grasp both the financial and shipping markets. "She is just as happy to mull over the fuel economies that can be achieved by proper sandblasting as she is to discuss the intricacies of financial tools". Asked about the role of women in top posts in shipping, she retorted that "I don't believe in gender, race, religion. I think it's what you want to make it. If you ever thought that you work in a company for any other reason than your ability, you should leave!"
