Caisse d'allocations familiales


# Caisse d'allocations familiales



**Family allocations** make up the family-oriented sector of the French social security system, through a network known as the **Caisse nationale des allocations familiales** (National Office for Family Allocations) or CNAF and the 101 **Caisse d'allocations familiales** (Family Allocations Office, or CAF).

The institution serves more than 10 million beneficiaries.


## Background

It was formalized by the decree of October 4, 1945.


## The allowances

Family benefits are not taxable, but subject to the contribution for the reimbursement of social debt with the exception of social minima such as RSA, AAH and formerly API and RMI. Their amount is set by legislative texts as a percentage of the monthly basis for calculating Family Allowances.

They are in principle unassignable and unseizable except:

* in the event of fraud or false declaration;
* for the recovery of maintenance claims (canteen costs in particular);
* for the recovery of healthcare costs (hospitalization for example);
* regarding the housing allowance where benefits can be paid directly to the lessor in certain cases.

Without exception, family benefits are paid monthly and in arrears and are due from the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the conditions for entitlement are met. Subject to the rules specific to each service, the prescription is biennial. The end of entitlement is fixed on the first day of the calendar month during which the conditions for opening the entitlement cease to be met, except in the event of death (in this case, the termination of entitlement is the month following the death).
