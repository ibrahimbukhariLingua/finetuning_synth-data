## Company history

Conning & Company was founded in Hartford, Connecticut in 1912 by William Smith Conning. Conning was born in Slingerlands, New York, just outside of Albany on September 16, 1877, and moved to Hartford in 1904 to serve as office manager for investment firm Hornblower & Weeks.

He founded the firm together with William C. Goeben, a colleague of Conning's at Hornblower & Weeks. The firm embraced the technology of the day, providing election returns to clients by wire from New York during President Woodrow Wilson’s t narrow, re-election victory in 1916 over Charles Evans Hughes.

In 1920, Conning & Company installed a bond ticker and moved into a newly constructed building on Lewis Street in Hartford. In January 1923, Conning Realty Company was incorporated for $50,000 by Conning, Goeben, Mitchell and Charles T. Treadway.

In 1935, a year shy of celebrating its 60th anniversary, the Hartford Stock Exchange closed after failing to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the firm was no longer registered with the exchange. Two of the oldest investment firms in Hartford joined forces when Conning & Company merged with Ballard & Company on December 4, 1942, to become Conning & Company and Ballard.

In late 1948, William S. Conning’s wife, Carolyn Dermott Conning, died. Four months later, the widowed Conning died at the age of 71, leaving behind the couple’s daughter, Katharine S. Conning, who died in 1996.


### Early activities

In 1950, Conning & Company began offering insurance stock research and advice to institutional investors.

After Conning & Company celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1962, the firm continued to emphasize research and education. In 1968, the firm became a Registered Investment Advisor with the SEC.

During 1970, the firm branched out into consulting and strategic industry research for senior insurance executives. By 1974, the firm had 13 Partners and 60 employees operating in Hartford with a subsidiary, Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc., headquartered in London. The subsidiary provided research on U.S. insurance companies and banks to institutional investors throughout Europe.


### Mergers and acquisitions (1985–1999)

In the mid- to late-1980s, the firm formed two new groups: a venture capital unit to raise private equity for insurance investments and an asset management group to manage insurance companies’ assets.

In 1995, Conning Corp. and its subsidiary Conning & Company. were acquired by General American Life Insurance Company (GALIC). Conning Corp.’s asset management business was merged with General American Investment Management Company (GAIMCO) to form Conning Asset Management Company (now known as Conning, Inc.). In 1997, GALIC took Conning Corp. public and completed an initial public offering of 2.875 million shares in 1997. The company began trading on NASDAQ as CNNG.

As part of these changes, Conning & Company’s broker-dealer business was shut down and the remnants were combined with Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc.’s similar business; also, its insurance industry research and publications business was transferred to Fox-Pitt Kelton management.

In 2002, Swiss Re Asset Management's Americas’ asset liability management unit came under Conning's control with 20 employees relocating to Hartford. In June, Conning Asset Management Company sold its Mortgage Loan and Real Estate business to Key Corp, and in December, Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company sold Noddings to First Albany.

In the first six months of 2003, the company spun out Schroeder Mortgage and Conning Capital Partners in MBOs. Conning US then took over management of SR Asset Management's European third-party asset management businesses in Dublin and London. Although Swiss Re continued to own the entities, they were renamed Conning Asset Management (Europe) Limited located in Dublin and Conning Asset Management Limited located in London.

In 2004, Conning Corp. and Conning, Inc. merged with and into Conning & Company, leaving two entities: Conning & Company and Conning Asset Management Company which then changed its name to Conning, Inc.
