Fast Money (talk show)


# Fast Money (talk show)



***Fast Money*** is an American financial stock trading talk show that began airing on the CNBC cable/satellite TV channel on Jan. 8, 2007. Beginning October 10, 2007, it was broadcast every weeknight at 5pm ET, one hour after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, until mid-2011 when it was moved to just four nights per week, Monday through Thursday, to make room for special option and currency trading shows on Friday evenings. On March 22, 2013, it returned to the Friday night slot as a half-hour show, followed by the *Options Action* half-hour show. The Friday edition of *Fast Money* returned to being a full-hour show on September 22, 2023, after *Options Action* was quietly cancelled the previous Friday (September 15, 2023). The show originates from the NASDAQ MarketSite in New York City.


## Program format

Melissa Lee anchors a fast-paced discussion among four professional Wall Street traders. The group discusses various investment strategies, including technical analysis, and debate the merits of each other's arguments for or against a particular stock or sector. The show covers topics such as options trading, commodities, and exchange-traded funds.

Most episodes feature regularly appearing traders: Guy Adami, Bonawyn Eison, Karen Finerman, Steve Grasso, Brian Kelly, Mike Khouw, Pete Najarian, Dan Nathan, Tim Seymour, and Nadine Terman.


## History

The success of *Mad Money* prompted CNBC to look to replicate that success with another show. *Fast Money* was created by Dylan Ratigan and Susan Krakower, Vice President of Strategic Programming and Development, as a spin off from a weekly segment that first aired in the May 2006 episodes of *On the Money*. The show originally aired from CNBC headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, with Ratigan as host, and a regular panel of Jeff Macke, Guy Adami, Tim Strazzini, and Eric Bolling. By January 8, 2007, it became a weekday show with its studio at the NASDAQ MarketSite.

On Fridays, beginning with March 5, 2010, the show was truncated to just 30 minutes as *Options Action* (also hosted by Melissa Lee) was aired in the 5:30 ET timeslot. Both *Fast Money* and *Options Action* are broadcast from the NASDAQ MarketSite.

In mid-2011, *Fast Money* was removed from the Friday night line-up altogether to make room for *Money in Motion: Currency Trading* (also hosted by Melissa Lee) which airs in the 5:30 ET time slot, while *Options Action* was moved up a half-hour to 5pm ET. On March 22, 2013, it returned to the Friday night lineup. The program airs the first half hour (5pm ET) followed by half hour of *Options Action* at 5:30pm ET. *Money in Motion* was removed from the CNBC lineup

On October 13, 2014, *Fast Money*, along with CNBC's other business-day programs, were launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of a network-wide switch to a full 16:9 presentation.

On September 22, 2023, the Friday edition of *Fast Money* was extended back to 60 minutes, in line with its Monday-Thursday shows, after *Options Action* (the television program) was quietly cancelled the previous Friday (September 15, 2023).


## Panelist changes

Strazzini was replaced by Najarian on May 18, 2007. Bolling was replaced by Finerman on September 4, 2007. Seymour, who had appeared on the show as a substitute panelist, was made a regular in October 2008. Ratigan left the network on March 27, 2009 when his CNBC contract expired. Ratigan was replaced by Lee, who sometimes filled in for Ratigan. Macke left CNBC on June 15, 2009

* The Takedown: When one panelist disagrees with the other over a certain issue or comment.
* Trade School: If a member of the panel uses Wall Street jargon, Lee will decipher it for viewers (with an accompanying definition).
* Word On The Street: "Best money making chatter behind the scenes"; involves in depth discussion on the various stocks that have made recent news.
* Street Fight: CNBC contributor, Herb Greenberg, takes on the 4 panelists and challenges one of the stock picks each panelist has recommended, Ratigan (and now Melissa Lee) picks a winner after each "fight" by siding with the views of the panelist or Herb Greenberg.

* Fast Fire: Panelists are held accountable for their past bad picks and are confronted on-air. This segment is seen on Fridays.
* Stocks on Sale: Panelists asked Ratigan (the original host) whether or not a stock that is mentioned is on sale (very similar to the *Lightning Round* on *Mad Money*). This segment is no longer current.

The answer to the question was revealed after the commercial break. This segment was discontinued in January 2008 and replaced by the *Trader Radar* (see below).

## Programming and ratings

*Fast Money's* first 13 episodes (including one live audience broadcast) aired during the summer of 2006 in the Wednesday 8pm ET timeslot. Ratings were relatively low, with the program averaging a bit over 110,000 viewers per week. During the week of 2006-09-18, the program tried a new timeslot at 5pm ET, the plush timeslot with highly rated *Closing Bell* serving as the lead-out (bumping *Kudlow & Company* to 8pm for the week). Here the show flourished, nearly doubling its viewership average to 211,000 viewers (on-par with what K&C normally gets). The 5pm ET timeslot, while successful, bumped *Kudlow & Company* to 8pm. This brought the show's ratings down substantially compared to where they were before the temporary move. After its successful 5pm test run during the week of 2006-09-18, CNBC retried the program again at 8pm the week after. CNBC had hoped it may have gained some traction after the increased viewership from the week prior. The show did not. Ratings were roughly on-par with the summer 2006 airings.


## Production

*Fast Money* broadcasts live weekdays at 5p ET from Times Square New York, New York, second-floor studios of the NASDAQ by CNBC, a national cable television network owned by NBC Universal/Comcast.

As of January 2009, among the many contributors are producer Jason Farkas, and tape producers Heather Wilcox and Boaz Halaban, responsible for creating and delivering the final show to air, after creating special Avid Adrenaline edited elements by CNBC Staff Avid Editors such as Conrad deVroeg, Gary Princz, Diana Constantino, and Dave Lettieri, and constructing the show with CNBC Staff Grass Valley NewsEdit Editors Rich Uliasz, Cosimo Camporeale, Carolyn Shivey, Vanessa DiPietro, Keri Conjura, Diana Acosta, and Kelly Frisco.
