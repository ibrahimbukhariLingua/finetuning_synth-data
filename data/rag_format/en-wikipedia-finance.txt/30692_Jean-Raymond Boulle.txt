The Permanent Grant was confirmed by the UK Privy Council in 2008, based on an earlier Permanent Lease (999-year lease) dating back to 1901.


### Other work

In November 2012, entertainment industry media outlet Variety reported that The Jean Boulle Group own the adaptation rights for the 1969 counterculture classic film Easy Rider originally released by Columbia Pictures and were part of a consortium including Maurice Fadida's Kodiak Pictures, Defiant Studios' Eric B. Fleischman.

Boulle is Vice Chairman of the Board of directors of the US based Corporate Council on Africa. Corporate Council on Africa is the 'leading U.S. business association focused solely on connecting business interests between the United States and Africa. CCA uniquely represents a broad cross-section of member companies from small and medium-sized businesses to multinationals as well as U.S. and African firms.'

In 1999 and 2000, Boulle was a 'prime mover in the creation of America's primary governing law on trade with Africa: The African Growth and Opportunity Act (**AGOA**)'. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) provides duty-free treatment to goods of designated sub-Saharan African countries (SSAs) and includes Mauritius. The African Growth and Opportunity Act program promotes economic growth through good governance and free markets. It covers non-textile as well as textile goods and was most recently re-authorized to September 30, 2025.

In 2002, Boulle sponsored and promoted Mauritius as a venue and helped to organise and contributed to the Second US-SSA AGOA Forum on 13 January 2003.


## Conservation


### Cargados Carajos

At the request of the Mauritius Government in February 1997, the World Bank, together with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, financed and produced a Management Plan for Saint Brandon in 1998. The World Bank Management Plan recommended the creation of the ''Marine Protected Area of Saint Brandon'' based on the Great Barrier Reef Model.

The Mauritian Government's (Ministry of Shipping, Rodrigues and Outer Islands) Blue Print on the Cargados Carajos Group of Islands (Saint Brandon) in 2004 recommended that government apply to the World Heritage Committee for the inclusion of Saint Brandon in the World Heritage List. (See Page 18, Section 6 (d))

In April 2016, Boulle's Jean Boulle Group funded and organised a seven-day fact-finding mission in the Mascarene Islands for three of the world's conservation experts to Île Raphael, one of the Thirteen Islands of St. Brandon held in permanent grant by the centenarian Raphael Fishing Company in the Cargados Carajos on the Atoll of St Brandon: Professor Henk Bauwman (Ecotoxicology, Environmental Pollution, Bird Ecology); Professor Tony Martin (world's foremost expert on marine mammals) and Dr. Nick Cole (herpetologist; MWF Islands Restoration Manager). These experts inspected the St Brandon islands to raise awareness about the need to protect their unique biodiversity and to investigate, for the longer term, the effects of plastic and heavy metal pollution in the Indian Ocean. The St. Brandon Archipelago has been declared an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.


### Mahebourg

In 2020, in the aftermath of the MV Wakashio oil spill, the Jean Boulle Group enabled the emergency rescue of three species of rare reptiles (lesser night gecko, Bojer's skink -Gongylomorphus bojerii (Critically Endangered (IUCN 3.1)), Bouton's skink -Cryptoblepharus boutonii) from Mauritius and transported them to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in Jersey. Moving the reptiles to Jersey offered a lifeline in establishing assurance populations of these animals and their unique genes, well away from the disaster zone until the long-term impacts of the MV Wakashio oil spill are fully understood.


### Controversy

Boulle's America Mineral Fields was associated, together with other multinational companies, with allegedly profiting from *Africa's misery* (1998) and manipulating African governments (2000) in a draft UN report on alleged illegal exploitation of resources from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The final United Nations Report S/2003/1027 sent by United Nations Secretary General Kofi A. Annan to the Security Council on 23 October 2003 later dismissed these allegations in relation to several other multinational companies, including America Mineral Fields.


## Personal life

Boulle has British nationality. He is a Mauritian citizen, and lives in Monaco. He is married and has two children.


## Honours

In 2007, Boulle was made a Commander of the Order of the Rokel, the highest order of merit of Sierra Leone for contributions to the economy of Sierra Leone through the establishment of a titanium and a bauxite mine after the civil war.
