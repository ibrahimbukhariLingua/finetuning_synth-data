# Susman Godfrey



**Susman Godfrey LLP** is an American litigation boutique law firm specializing in high-stakes commercial disputes. Founded in 1980, the firm pioneered the use of contingency fees in corporate litigation, a model that was unconventional at the time. The firm has established itself as a leader in complex litigation and is consistently ranked as one of the top trial law firms in the United States.


## History


### Founding and Early Years (1980s–1990s)

Susman Godfrey LLP was founded in 1980 in Houston, Texas, by Stephen Susman, a prominent trial attorney known for his ability to secure large verdicts. At a time when most commercial litigation firms relied on billable hours, Susman revolutionized the industry by offering contingency fee arrangements to corporate clients. This allowed businesses to pursue major lawsuits without upfront legal costs, shifting financial risk onto the law firm.

In 1982, H. Lee Godfrey joined the firm, leading to the firm’s current name. The firm quickly expanded into high-stakes antitrust, securities, and intellectual property litigation.


### Expansion and National Recognition (2000s–2020s)

The firm expanded beyond Texas, opening offices in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle, each focusing on high-profile litigation cases.

In 2020, the firm’s founder, Stephen Susman, passed away due to complications from COVID-19.
