# Business Bay



**Business Bay** (Arabic: الخليج التجاري: *Al-Khaleej Al-Tijari*) is a central business district under construction in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The project features numerous skyscrapers located in an area where Dubai Creek has been dredged and extended, and located immediately south of Downtown Dubai. Business Bay will have upwards of 240 buildings, comprising commercial and residential developments. The infrastructure of Business Bay has been completed in 2008, and the entire development was expected to be completed between 2012 and 2015. Business Bay is part of the vision of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashed Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Ruler of Dubai. Business Bay will be a new 'city' within the city of Dubai and is being built as a commercial, residential and business cluster along a new extension of Dubai Creek extending from Ras Al Khor to Sheikh Zayed Road. Covering an area of 64,000,000 square feet (5,900,000 m²), it is composed of office and residential towers set in landscaped gardens with a network of roads, pathways and canals.


## Development

The entire development covers an area of 46,900,000 sq ft (4,360,000 m²), and the gross leasable area is 78,500,000 sq ft (7,290,000 m²). The projected population of the entire development is more than 191,000, and the estimated population of employers and others is 110,000, making the total population more than 300,000. Commercial development will comprise 2,653,244 sq ft (246,494.4 m²), which is 18.5 percent of the entire development; mixed use development will comprise 8,520,368 square feet (791,568.1 m²) (59.4 percent); and residential development will cover 3,163,628 sq ft (293,910.7 m²) (22.1 percent). Business Bay will cost AED 110 billion (US$30 billion).


## Bay Square

Bay Square is a single-use community within Business Bay. The entire development will be a pedestrian-only zone, and will include walkways over canals. It will cover over 2,400,000 square feet (220,000 m²) and will be located 1 km (0.62 mi) away from Sheikh Zayed Road within Business Bay.
