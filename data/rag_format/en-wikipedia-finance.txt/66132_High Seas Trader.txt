High Seas Trader


# High Seas Trader



***High Seas Trader*** is a 1995 naval business simulation video game. The player runs trade routes, fends off pirates, collects artifacts and offers transport to fellow countrymen in need, all for the sake of climbing up the game's ranking ladder, which in turn allows the player to buy bigger ships, more firepower and larger cargo holds to progress more quickly in the ranks.


## Gameplay

The game is set in the year 1650. The player starts out with the most basic ship (Fluyt) and 5,000 (5k) gold.


### Nations

The player chooses a nation at the beginning of the game. Consequences lie in the relations between nations; which nations declare war/peace will determine which ports the player can access at given times, and which ships will open fire on them at sea. The options are:

* Dutch
* English
* French
* Portuguese
* Spanish

### Guild ladder

Climbing up the ladder ranks grants the player titles, access to bigger ships, and bigger estates. The player can gather points in the categories, then cash them in for a title. Once they are granted a title, the points in the categories reset, allowing them to do it all over.


### Ammo

* Round (Long-range ammunition)
* Chain (Short-range ammunition, tears up sails leaving enemy ships dead in the water)
* Grape (Short-range ammunition, leaves big holes in attacking ships, akin to firing a huge shotgun filled with grape-sized balls of steel. Note: The actual purpose of grapeshot was to reduce the enemy crew.)

### Cannons

* Swivel-gun (0.3t)
* Saker (1.0t)
* Demi-culverin (1.2t)
* Culverin (2.0t)
* Demi-cannon (2.5t)
* Cannon (3.0t)

### Banks

Players can place money in banks for safekeeping. This is useful if they ever lose a battle at sea, as they can start over with their savings. However, the savings are reduced by the interest rate over time, as the player must pay for the security.
