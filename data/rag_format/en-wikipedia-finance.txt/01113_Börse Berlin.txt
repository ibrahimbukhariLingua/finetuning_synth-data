Börse Berlin


# Börse Berlin



**Börse Berlin AG** (or *Berlin Stock Exchange*) is a stock exchange based in Berlin, Germany. It was founded in 1685 through an edict of Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm, and is one of the oldest exchanges in Germany.


## History

The Berlin Stock Exchange was founded on June 29, 1685, by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. The first trading session took place on February 25, 1739. First, the upper floor of the former Lusthaus in the Lustgarten next to the Berlin Cathedral in direct proximity to Berliner Stadtschloss was used before 1798 in favour of a new building for the stock exchange at the same place was demolished. The bearer of the stock exchange from 1803 was the United Stock Exchange Corporation, from 1820 the newly founded corporation of merchants. The building located in the Burgstraße 25–26 on the other side of the Spree was built from 1859 to 1863 by Friedrich Hitzig and opened on 1 October 1863. Because of its location in Burgstrasse, the Berlin Stock Exchange was also called "The Burgstrasse". The total cost of the construction was 700,000 Thaler. Economically, until the beginning of the First World War, the Berlin Stock Exchange was one of the three most important in the world – after London and next to New York. With the general mobilization of Russia on July 30, 1914, the beginning of the First World War, it was completely closed. The unrestricted free market resumed on November 2, 1917.

In 1920, when the corporation of the Kaufmannschaft merged after one hundred years of existence in the Berlin Chamber of Commerce founded in 1902, the sponsorship of the stock exchange passed on to the latter. In 1922, the Stock Index of the Statistical Office was calculated for the first time, based on the average price level of around 300 representative shares of the Berlin Stock Exchange. Wirtschaftsrundfunk, an agency for business news, had an office in the stock market. The Black Friday on May 13, 1927, caused the stock index on the stock exchange to collapse by 31.9 percent. At the end of 1926, 917 public companies were traded on the Stock Exchange, but by the end of 1932 only 659 were traded. By 1943, the number of listed companies dropped to 450. The Second World War in 1943 led to the suspension of the price determination by the Statistical Reichsamt.

On May 24, 1944, the stock exchange building burned down after being hit in an air raid. The ruins were demolished in 1957 and 1958. For a long time, a few visible parts of the building (pillar parts, façade decoration) lay behind a construction fence that was still under construction from 2001 onwards.


## Börse Berlin after the Second World War

After the war, the Berlin Stock Exchange in West Berlin was reopened. Nevertheless, with all major corporations and banks leaving the city, the stock market never regained the importance it had before the war. ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In order to address internationalization and growing consolidation pressure, Börse Berlin has pursued a niche strategy since the mid-nineties, with a particular focus on trading the widest range of foreign stocks and bonds.

In September 2007 Börse Berlin took a majority stake in EASDAQ NV, an exchange operating under the brand Equiduct. With the pan-European market model of Equiduct, Börse Berlin re-positioned itself as a start-up. The key requirement of MiFID – best execution – is guaranteed by Equiduct, order by order. The launch of the Equiduct marketplace took place on March 20, 2009.

On July 21, 2009, Equiduct entered into a strategic partnership with Citadel Securities, a division of Citadel Investment Group, L.L.C.. The agreement between Citadel Securities and Börse Berlin AG will provide the funding required by Equiduct to develop its platform. Equiduct will continue to be operated by Börse Berlin AG, trading takes place on the newly created market segment (B.S.R.M.) or Berlin Second Regulated Market.

In October 2019 the stock exchange operator Tradegate Exchange GmbH announced the completion of an asset deal to acquire 100 percent of the shares in the Berlin Börse AG, the operating company of the traditional Berlin Stock Exchange and the London-based platform, Equiduct. In return, the previous owner of the Berlin Börse AG, the Verein Berliner Börse e.V., receives a stake in the Tradegate Exchange GmbH. In the future, the three exchanges geared to the needs of private investors Tradegate Exchange, Börse Berlin, and Equiduct will be operated and further developed under one roof.

The Exchange Council of Börse Berlin appointed Ms. Friederike von Hofe as managing director of Börse Berlin with effect from August 1, 2020. Also, with effect from August 1, 2020, the supervisory board of the sponsoring company appointed Ms von Hofe as a member of the executive board of Börse Berlin AG.

Until June 2022, Börse Berlin was headquartered in Ludwig-Erhard-Haus, a building designed by Nicholas Grimshaw at the Fasanenstraße 85 in the Charlottenburg district. Since June 2022, Börse Berlin has been located at Kurfürstendamm, a well-known boulevard in Berlin.
