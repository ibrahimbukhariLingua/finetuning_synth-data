Commodity product Markup Language


# Commodity product Markup Language



**Commodity product Markup Language** (CpML) is an industry standard used in wholesale energy trading. CpML is an XML-based business mark-up language used for interoperable representation of energy trades for the purpose of post-deal-execution processes like deal confirmation and regulatory reporting.

The CpML standard defines the vocabulary for exchanging standardized messages for commodity trading and reporting processes and is growing according to increased coverage of post-trade services like eCM (electronic Confirmations Matching) and eRR (electronic Regulatory Reporting). It was extended to include document structures to exchange and validate invoices and netting statements in the energy sector (electronic Settlement Matching) by the EFET in 2019.


## History

CpML 5.0 was first announced in 2013, and is based on previous standards created by European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET). CpML is governed by the CpML Foundation, a foundation under Dutch law created in 2014.


## Governance

The Governance Board of the CpML Foundation consisted initially of representatives of EDF Trading, Freepoint Commodities Europe, Gazprom Marketing & Trading, RWE Supply & Trading, BP and EFET.
