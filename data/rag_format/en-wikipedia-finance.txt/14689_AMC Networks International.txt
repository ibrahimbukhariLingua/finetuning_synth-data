**AMC Networks International** is the division of AMC Networks that operates outside the United States. AMC Networks commissions and distributes TV channels, content and video services. The division's operating companies and business units currently own and operate in joint venture a total of 68 branded TV channels and run a suite of digital, on demand and broadband services in Europe. In aggregate, its channels and feeds reach 382 million homes.

The company was originally named **Chellomedia** and was part of Liberty Global. In 2013, it was sold to AMC Networks (a former subsidiary of Cablevision), and was renamed AMC Networks International.


## History

On July 31, 2012, Chellomedia purchased MGM Networks, Inc. from MGM while MGM retaining its United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and joint ventures in Brazil and Australia. Chellomedia has licensed the MGM brand and content to continue on the purchased MGM channels.

On May 21, 2013, it was announced that Liberty Global had put Chellomedia up for sale. Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia to AMC Networks for $1.035B, except for its Benelux unit. The purchase was completed on February 2, 2014.

On July 8, 2014, Chellomedia was renamed AMC Networks International. In November, AMC Networks renamed the European MGM Channel to AMC.
