### 1987 Chicago mayoral campaign

In 1987, Haider won the Republican mayoral primary, making him the party's nominee for mayor. Haider had, previous to running for the Republican Party's mayoral nomination, been a Democrat. The fifth overall mayoral candidate to be a resident of Edgewater, Haider would have been the third mayor from Edgewater if he were elected (and the first since Martin H. Kennelly). Ahead of the primary, Haider was endorsed by the city's Republican Party organization on December 4, 1986. He had narrowly defeated 1983 nominee Bernard Epton for the endorsement. The search committee to find a candidate for the Republican Party to endorse had been chaired by Dan K. Webb. After receiving the party's endorsement on December 2, 1985, he formally launched his campaign on December 3. Despite the party organization having already endorsing Haider, both Epton and Democratic state senator Jeremiah E. Joyce indicated their intentions to challenge Haider in the Republican primary. Neither ultimately ran. Instead, he was challenged by Kenneth Hurst, Chester Hornowski, and Ray Wardingley. Haider won the party's nomination in the Republican primary.

His candidacy was seen as a long shot. However, Republican leaders initially hoped that the 1986 election of Republican James O'Grady as Cook County sheriff was a sign that a Republican might be able to perform well in the 1987 mayoral election. They hoped that a strong performance by Haider would assist the party in getting a Republican affiliated candidate elected Chicago alderman for the first time in twelve years. Republican Party leaders considered him the party's most qualified mayoral candidate they had put forth in a long while. However, a March 1987 poll showed that very few of those that had voted for 1983 Republican nominee Bernard Epton in the last election were intending to vote for Haider the 1987 election. Part of this was attributed to there being two other white challengers against Harold Washington, Edward Vrdolyak and Thomas Hynes. He also lagged in fundraising, with those opposed to Washington donating mostly to the other two challengers' campaigns, and with Republican Party members more focused on donating to presidential campaigns, as the race for the 1984 Republican Party presidential primaries had already begun. His fundraising severely lagged behind the other campaigns. Hynes withdrew from the race just before the general election, but this did not help Haider's performance.

During the campaign, in a desperate bid for press, Haider rode an elephant (an animal often used to symbolize the Republican Party) down State Street.

In the general election he placed last out of the three candidates in the general election, only garnering 4.3% of the vote.
