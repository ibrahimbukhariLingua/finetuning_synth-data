Value-added tax (VAT) was introduced into the Indian taxation system from 1 April 2005. The existing general sales tax laws were replaced with the Value Added Tax Act (2005) and associated VAT rules.

A few states (Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh) opted to stay out of VAT taxation system during the initial introduction of VAT but adopted it later.

As of 2 June 2014, VAT has been implemented in all the states and union territories of India except Pondicherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Island.
