## Projects


### Asian Business Leadership Forum

The Asian Business Leadership Forum (ABLF) is an annual event series that celebrates high achievers in Asian business. In its inaugural edition, the ABLF Awards 2011 recognized 14 business leaders across five categories in the three Asian regions of the Persian Gulf, India, and Southeast Asia.

According to Kamal Nath, Indian Urban Development Minister, "Events like the ABLF Awards are important because they support the opportunity of engagement between Asian countries. The Persian Gulf, India and South-East Asia are amongst the fastest growing regions in the world, and I am sure that this event will engage the best entrepreneurial minds and business talent from the regions."

Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman and chief executive of the Emirates Group, said, "I am very glad that the UAE is participating at the Asian Business Leadership Forum Awards, an event that celebrates Asia as a whole."

The third edition of the ABLF Awards took place on 14 December 2013, at the Armani Hotel in Dubai. Some awardees included Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, president of the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority; Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, Prime Minister of Bahrain; Chua Sock Koong, CEO of Singtel; Prathap C. Reddy, chairman of Apollo Hospitals; and William E. Heinecke, CEO and chairman of Minor International.

During the 2013 award show, ABLF featured an "India-UAE" showcase that celebrated six India–UAE business icons responsible for growing socioeconomic ties between the two nations. These included Abdullah Mohammed Saleh, governor of the Dubai International Financial Centre; M. A. Yousuf Ali, managing director of LuLu Group International; Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, CEO and managing director of NMC Health and UAE Exchange.

The 2013 event also unveiled OneAsia2020, with a keynote address by one of its proponents, Thaksin Shinawatra, former Prime Minister of Thailand.

The leadership event series marked its tenth anniversary on 22 November 2017, once more at the Armani Hotel in Dubai. It honoured Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, chairwoman of the General Women's Union and the Family Development Foundation of the UAE, and president of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood.

On 3 March 2019, the ABLF launched a special-edition magazine in partnership with *Gulf News*. Dedicated to the Year of Tolerance, the magazine features leaders and stories from across Asia. These include Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts India; N.R. Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys; Gopichand Hinduja, co-chairman of the Hinduja Group of Companies; Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon; Mohammed Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz Al Shihhi, undersecretary of the Ministry of Economy; Reem Al Hashimy, Minister of State for International Cooperation and director general of Expo 2020; and Maitha bint Salem Al Shamsi, Minister of State.
