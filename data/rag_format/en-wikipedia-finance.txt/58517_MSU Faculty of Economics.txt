In 2005, the faculty included 350 teachers and research associates. 62 of them held Doctor of Sciences degree and 208 are Candidates of Sciences. There were 21 different academic departments and 14 research laboratories. Alexander Auzan is the incumbent Dean of the faculty (elected in 2013).


## History

The faculty was founded in 1941. Ivan Udaltsov [ru] became the first dean of the faculty (1941–1955). At first year, there were 28 students, 6 teachers and only one academic department - of political economy. The main goal of the enterprise was to prepare qualified specialists for science and management purposes. By mid-50s some new academic departments emerged and yearly intake rose to approximately 50 students.

At next decade, during the Khrushchev Thaw, the faculty started to pay more attention to applied disciplines and new ways for improving the economic system. The intake rose to 100 students per year. Next period, mid-60s - mid-80s, the faculty expands further to 200 students per year.

At mid-80s, there were significant changes due to new economic policy of Perestroika. Many new departments were established during this period, including 'Finance and Credit' department. MSU Faculty of Economics became the first major educational body to introduce the new system of academic degrees: bachelor and master. It helped to become more close to international community but possibly launched a conflict with the traditional Russian educational system.

In the 1990s, MSU Faculty of Economics has flourished due to economic liberalization and became one of the most desired places to study in (in Russia). The yearly intake gradually increased to 350 students. In 2009, MSU Faculty of Economics moved to a new building.
