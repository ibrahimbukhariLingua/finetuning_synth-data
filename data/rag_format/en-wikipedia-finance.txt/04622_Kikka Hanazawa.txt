## Early life and education

Kikka Hanazawa, born in Tokyo, is the daughter of Ikue Hanazawa, an haute couture business owner, and Kiyoshi Yokoyama, a business entrepreneur who later became a Tendai Buddhist monk. She is also the niece of Tomiyo Hanazawa, a notable fashion designer who specialized in modern kimonos and staged the first kimono fashion show in the US in 1957. Both Ikue and Tomiyo Hanazawa began their fashion careers working with Chiyo Uno, a prominent feminist author in Japan. Chiyo Uno, who founded 'Sutairu' (Style), Japan's first fashion magazine in 1936, and a boutique in Ginza, greatly influenced them. Heeding Uno's advice to be independent women, Tomiyo and Ikue remained unmarried and dedicated much of their lives to the fashion business alongside Chiyo Uno. Despite growing up surrounded by influential women in fashion, Hanazawa initially did not aspire to pursue a career in fashion.

In 2000, Hanazawa graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a B.A. in Art History & Architecture Theory. To finance her education, she worked at Itochu in New York, where she quickly rose to become one of the youngest female managers. She continued her education at Harvard Business School, earning an M.B.A. in 2002.

Kikka Hanazawa held the position of CEO at VPL, a prominent women's activewear brand, until 2022.

Additionally, her tenure at Cygne Designs was marked by her leadership in a management buyout of the company's international division, a successful initiative she both started and later sold.
