## History

Formerly "Jiangsu Shagang Group Company Limited", it was established in 1975 with self-financing of only 450,000 Renminbi. At the end of 2007, it employs over 26,700 staff, covers an area of 10 km², and has total assets over RMB100 billion Yuan.

The company drew the world's attention in 2001 when it acquired a steel mill (the Dortmund-Hörde plant) from German industrial giant ThyssenKrupp for 30 million euros and shipped its equipment to China where it was reassembled and resumed operation.

Shagang Group acquired the controlling stake in Huaigang and renamed it into Huaigang Special Steel in 2006. The stake floated on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange as Shagang Company in 2010. In 2015 Shagang Group sold most of the stake in Shagang Company.

In 2016, the Group headed a consortium that acquired London-based international data center Global Switch Holdings for £2.4 billion (HK$23.03 billion). The consortium bought a 49 percent stake in the company in order to expand Global Switch Holding's strategic infrastructure.

Due to ongoing overcapacity within the steel sector, Jiangsu Shagang Group purchased two internet data firms for $3.8 billion, as part of an attempt to expand into new industries for diversification. The June 2017 deal targets Jiangsu Qingfeng Investment Management Co. Ltd. and Beijing Daily Tech Co. Ltd.
