Central Association of Austrian Social Insurance Authorities


# Central Association of Austrian Social Insurance Authorities



The **Central Association of Austrian Social Insurance Authorities** (*Hauptverband der österreichischen Sozialversicherungsträger*) was established in 1948 and later renamed **Hauptverband der österreichischen Sozialversicherungsträger**. It served as the umbrella organisation covering Austria’s health, accident and pension insurance. In a comprehensive reorganisation in 2019, by means of the Sozialversicherungs-Organisationsgesetz, the public corporation was renamed as Federation of Social Insurances (*Dachverband der österreichischen Sozialversicherungsträger*) from 1 January 2020 onwards and thoroughly restructured. Its legal entity, however, remained the same, which means that all existing contracts remain valid and in force for the time being.


## Organisation and independent administration

Austrian social insurance is based on the principle of independent self-administration. Independent administration means that the state transfers certain administrative tasks to those groups of persons that take a direct interest in them. Representatives of these groups then established administrative bodies whose tasks it is to manage the respective administrative areas without being subject to following directives from the state. The term of office of the administrative bodies of the Hauptverband was four years.

The self-administrating bodies of the*Hauptverband* were the *Conference of Insurance Institution* (*Trägerkonferenz*) and the *Board of the association* (*Verbandsvorstand*):
