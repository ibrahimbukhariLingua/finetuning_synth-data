# Nicholas Johannsen



**Nicholas August Ludwig Jacob Johansen** (1844–1928) was a German-American amateur economist, today best known for his influence on and citation by John Maynard Keynes. He wrote under two pen names: A. Merwin and J. J. O. Lahn.


## Influence

He was largely unrecognized in his lifetime, but following the Keynesian Revolution, he was recognized as one of the most significant influences on *The General Theory,* and he is cited in Keynes's 1930 *Treatise on Money* (p. 90). He is credited with devising an early form of effective demand, independent discovery of the multiplier, and less recognized contribution to monetary economics and business cycle theory; (Arestis & Sawyer).

His 1903 *Der Kreislauf des Geldes und Mechanismus des Sozial-Lebens* (*The Circuit Theory of Money,* written in German) can be seen as an early work in monetary circuit theory.

Crucially, he distinguished the roles of *savings* and *investment* – since only investment is directly productive, savings may be harmful to the economy, and may "tend to impoverish others" – a form of the paradox of thrift.

In his last years (1928), he warned of an upcoming long period of stagnation, which may be seen as prophesying the Great Depression.
