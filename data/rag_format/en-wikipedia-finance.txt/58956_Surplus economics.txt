Surplus economics


# Surplus economics



**Surplus economics** is the study of economics based upon the concept that economies operate on the basis of the production of a surplus over basic needs.


## Economic Surplus

By economic surplus is meant all production which is not essential for the continuance of existence. That is to say, all production about which there is a choice as to whether or not it is produced. The economic surplus begins when an economy is first able to produce more than it needs to survive, a surplus to its essentials.

Alternative definitions are:

1. The difference between the value of a society's annual product and its socially necessary cost of production. (Davis, p.1)
2. The range of economic freedom at its [society's] disposal, extent able to engage in socially discretionary spending that satisfies more than the basic needs of its producers. (Dawson & Foster in Davis, p.45)
3. Income minus essential consumption requirements. (Lippit in Davis p.81)
4. The difference between what a society can produce and what a society must produce to reproduce itself. (Standfield in Davis, p.131)
