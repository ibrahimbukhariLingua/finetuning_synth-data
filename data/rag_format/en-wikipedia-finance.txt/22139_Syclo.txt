**Syclo, LLC** (acquired and currently a part of SAP SE) was a mobile enterprise application platform (MEAP) and software provider based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois,
offering mobile applications to extend enterprise systems, including packaged software for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM), to handhelds, smartphones, and mobile computers for technicians and staff performing work away from a central office.

The company’s focus in the mobile middleware market is on business environments across industries, including utilities, oil and gas, and life sciences, that utilize field service management processes and typically have significantly valued hard assets to service and protect.

Syclo offers the Agentry mobile platform, an extensible framework based on fourth-generation programming language for developing, deploying, and managing a wireless business application architecture.

Syclo's SMART Mobile Suite of workflow-specific products, a software suite built on the Agentry platform, has been implemented by more than 750 customers in 35 countries and 20 different industries.
