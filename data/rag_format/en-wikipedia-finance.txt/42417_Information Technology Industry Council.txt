# Information Technology Industry Council



The **Information Technology Industry Council** (**ITI**) is a Washington, D.C.–based global trade association that represents companies from the information and communications technology (ICT) industry. As an advocacy organization, ITI works to influence policy issues aimed at encouraging innovation and promoting global competitiveness across the world.

Ars Technica has described the Information Technology Industry Council as "a lobbying group with a membership list that includes almost all the heavy-hitters of the tech world".
ITI works to help shape policy pertaining to tax, trade, talent, security, access, and sustainability issues for its member companies through its three main divisions: Environment and Sustainability, Global Policy, and Government Relations. ITI further supports its members by organizing industry-wide consensus on policy issues and providing access to global markets.

Jason Oxman is the current President and Chief Executive Officer of ITI.

According to its website, it was founded in 1916 in Chicago as the "National Association of Office Appliance Manufacturers", renamed the "Office Equipment Manufacturers Institute" in 1929, and became the "Business Equipment Manufacturers Association" (BEMA) in 1961. In 1973, it became the "Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association" (CBEMA), before receiving its current name in 1994.
