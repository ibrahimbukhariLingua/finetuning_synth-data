Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland


# Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland



The **Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland** (abbr. **ARA**, Finnish: *Asumisen rahoitus- ja kehitt√§miskeskus*) is a Finish government agency within the jurisdiction of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment, responsible for implementing state housing policy.

ARA's tasks include granting subsidies, support, and guarantees related to housing and construction. Additionally, ARA directs and supervises the use of ARA housing stock and is involved in projects related to housing development and expertise in the housing market. ARA collects, analyzes, and disseminates information about the housing market and maintains industry networking and information services.


## History

In the late 1940s, after the Continuation War, the Arava system was established for financing housing construction. In 1966, Arava's tasks were transferred to the Finnish Housing Fund, and with its abolition in 1993 to the State Housing Fund.

ARA was established in its current form on January 1, 2008. As part of the latest agency reform, ARA transitioned from a state housing finance-oriented organization to a body supporting development activities and communication in the construction sector. In a decentralization program of the government, ARA was relocated from Helsinki's Pasila to Lahti on July 1, 2008, based on a decision made in 2005.


## Tasks and Activities

ARA's tasks include:

* Developing sustainable, high-quality, and affordable housing;
* Improving housing conditions for low- and middle-income households and special groups;
* Directing and supervising the use of publicly beneficial housing communities and the ARA housing stock;

* Promoting, utilizing, and disseminating development activities and research related to housing conditions;
* Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating housing market information;
