Basic Income Earth Network


# Basic Income Earth Network



The **Basic Income Earth Network** (**BIEN**; until 2004 **Basic Income European Network**) is a network of academics and activists interested in the idea of basic income. It serves as a link between individuals and groups committed to or interested in basic income, and fosters informed discussion on this topic throughout the world. BIEN's website defines a basic income as "a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement."


## History

Formed in 1986, BIEN held its first international conference in Louvain-la-Neuve in September of that year. It expanded its scope from Europe to the Earth in 2004. From 1988 BIEN published a paper newsletter three times per year; later replaced by an electronic NewsFlash Archived 2017-06-06 at the Wayback Machine, distributed first six and now twelve times per year. Since 2011, BIEN has sponsored a news website, called *Basic Income News*.

The main founders of BIEN are Yoland Bresson, Philippe Van Parijs, Karl Widerquist, Alexander de Roo, Guy Standing and David Casassas.

Every two years until 2014, and every year since 2016, BIEN has organised an international congress gathering academics and activists for basic income. The 2016 Congress took place in Seoul, South Korea; the 2017 Congress in Lisbon, Portugal; The 2018 congress took place in Tampere, Finland; The 2019 BIEN congress takes place at Hyderabad, India. For a full list of congresses, see BIEN's website. Papers given at the congresses can also be found on the organisation's website.

BIEN recognises a number of national and regional affiliated networks across the world.
