* doctor of law at the Catholic University of Leuven in 1956;
* master in economics at the same university in 1959;
* Master of Law at Harvard Law School in 1960;
* master in political and social sciences at the University of Leuven in 1961;

## Career

He started his career in 1961 as a member of the Antwerp Bar (1956) then joined the American law firm Frank Boas Law Office in 1961 in Brussels, to become a partner in 1966.

He was also a lecturer at the Hoger Instituut voor Bestuurswetenschappen (University of Antwerp) (1962 - 1972).

He started his own law firm "De Bandt Dilley" on 1 July 1969 with Charles Dilley and two collaborators. Ivo Van Bael and Walter Van Gerven became partners. On 1 January Jean-Pierre Lagae also became a named partner, making the law firm's name "De Bandt, Lagae & Van Bael". Through a merger with the law firm of Georges van Hecke, which included a.o. Jean-Marie Nelissen-Grade, the firm grew and the name changed to "De Bandt, van Hecke, Lagae & Van Bael". Around 1992 Ivo Van Bael and Jean François Bellis left the partnership, thus reducing the name of the law firm.

For 20 years he was Chairman and Managing Partner of what became "De Bandt, van Hecke & Lagae". It was the first law firm in Belgium organized along the structure and lines of law partnerships in the United States and Great-Britain (partnership, full integration of revenues, clients are linked to the partnership not to a single partner, special status of associates moving to partnership, etc.). It was also one of the first to have lawyers that were not accredited in Belgium (in particular Japanese) joining and to have the day-to-day management of the office run by someone who was not an attorney.

The firm collaborated with other firms abroad. Starting on 1 January 1990 this was formalised in "The Alliance of European Lawyers" as a European Economic Interest Grouping, with a.o. an integrated office in Brussels ("Brussels Combined Office").

The firm merged in 1999 with the Luxemburg firm Loesch & Wolter to become De Bandt, van Hecke, Lagae & Loesch.

Since 1996 "The Alliance of European Lawyers" was looking to fit into the evolving market of internationally active law firms. On 22 July 1998 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between 4 members of "The Alliance of European Lawyers" (incl. "De Bandt, van Hecke & Lagae") and the London city firm "Linklaters & Paines". After an expedited integration, and one Alliance Partner (De Brauw in the Netherlands) and some partners of De Bandt, van Hecke, Lagae leaving, on 1 January 2001 "De Bandt, van Hecke, Lagae & Loesch" merged into "Linklaters De Bandt". De Bandt became senior counsel of the merged firm, Jean-Pierre Blumberg its managing partner.

At the time of the merger with Linklaters, De Bandt, van Hecke & Lagae was the largest firm of solicitors ("avocats-advocaten") in Belgium, with more than 200 full-time lawyers.

After having reached the age cap (for partners of Linklaters) he left the partnership and practices law as an independent lawyer.

Pierre de Bandt focuses on Belgian and European regulatory law (e.g. competition, free movement and regulated sectors) and Belgian commercial law. He is a member of the bar of Brussels.
