## History

Founded in 2001 by Russ Weiner, the son of right-wing radio show host Michael Savage.
Rockstar launched into what was the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. beverage market at the time, energy drinks.
In addition to featuring different ingredients, which it claimed were "scientifically formulated to speed the recovery time of those who lead active and exhausting lifestyles—from athletes to rock stars,"
Rockstar sought to differentiate itself from the market leader, Red Bull, by using a 16 US fluid ounces (470 ml) can size as opposed to Red Bull's 8 US fluid ounces (240 ml) can, and drawing attention to this fact with the slogan "twice the size of Red Bull for the same price".

By 2007, Rockstar was one of the top three energy drink brands in North America, with a 155% growth in sales in 2004, reaching $48 million,
and had sold over a billion cans. It had 14% of the US energy drink market in 2008, and as of 2009 was available in over 20 countries. Among those countries are Sold: in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Mexico, Malta, New Zealand, Argentina, the Netherlands, Finland, South Africa, Morocco and Colombia. Rockstar switched distributors from the Coca-Cola Company to PepsiCo in the summer of 2009.

Production and distribution for the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland was franchised to Irn Bru owners A.G. Barr, This contract was terminated in 2020, following the acquisition by PepsiCo.

In 2020, PepsiCo acquired Rockstar Energy for $3.85 billion.

In 2021, the company altered the flavor of the "Original" version and can styling underwent a re-design as part of a new marketing campaign.


## Contents

Original Rockstar Energy Drink includes sugar, caffeine, and a variety of herbs, like panax ginseng, ginkgo biloba, milk thistle extract, and guarana-seed extract. The amount of guarana used to be higher, but "after being criticized for including guarana once health concerns about the herb were publicized, the amount in the drink was significantly reduced".
It also includes 1000 mg of taurine.

Rockstar products in the US have two levels of caffeine content: either 10 mg of caffeine per ounce, or 15 mg of caffeine per ounce. Rockstar Energy Drink Original contains 160 mg of caffeine per 16 ounce can, while the Rockstar Punched and Pure Zero energy drinks contain 240 mg of caffeine per 16 ounce can.

Several alcoholic versions of Rockstar are available in Canada; an alcoholic version in the US was discontinued in 2007, possibly in response to criticism that young people were confusing the alcoholic version with the regular one.


## Criticism


### Health issues

Rockstar Original was named Worst Energy Drink by *Men's Health* magazine for having 280 calories due to 67.5 grams of sugar. Monster Energy Lo-Carb, with 20 calories, was suggested as a replacement.
Rockstar has responded to this kind of criticism by introducing a line of low calorie energy drinks that include electrolytes called "Rockstar Recovery".

In general, energy drinks can cause jitteriness and anxiety. If mixed with alcohol, they may also mask the level of alcohol intoxication. Used in moderation, no detrimental side effects have been known.


### Corporate governance

Members of the LGBT community have spoken out against Rockstar because the company's founder and chief executive officer is the son of right-wing radio personality Michael Savage and because its former chief financial officer, Janet Weiner, is Savage's wife and CFO of his production company. The boycott was motivated by allegations that Savage had made homophobic, racist, antisemitic, and discriminatory comments. In May 2009, then San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom returned a $25,000 donation which Rockstar had made to his 2010 re-election campaign.

During an interview with the *San Francisco Chronicle*, Newsom aide Eric Jaye stated the money was returned because "there was some statements made during (Weiner's) 1998 campaign in the GOP primary which conflicted with the mayor's position and we're returning the check," he said.

In a later interview Weiner told *SF Gate*: "I still wish Gavin well. I always will." But he said that with the donation rejected, "I'm taking this money and I'm donating it to charity. We're telling them to name a charity of their choosing, and if they don't want it, we'll donate it to Project Open Hand."

Janet Weiner stepped down from her role as CFO of Savage Productions "as an apparent statement of solidarity with equality advocates" which had not been requested as part of the agreement.


### Website dispute

Rockstar, saying that the "truthaboutrockstarenergydrink.com" domain name was registered and used in bad faith, obtained control of that site under a decision from the National Arbitration Forum.

Both the Mayhem and Uproar events were discontinued in 2015.
