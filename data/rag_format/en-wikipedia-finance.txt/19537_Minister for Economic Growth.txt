Minister for Economic Growth


# Minister for Economic Growth



The **Minister for Economic Growth**, previously the **Minister for Economic Development**, is a minister in the New Zealand Government with the responsibility of promoting development of New Zealand's economy, and is in charge of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The position was established in 1999.

The present minister is Nicola Willis.


## History

At its establishment, the Minister for Economic Development was the lead minister for the Ministry of Economic Development, which was established out of the former Ministry of Commerce as part of the Labour-Alliance coalition agreement.

From 1 July 2012, the Minister assumed responsibility for the new Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment following the merger of the Ministry of Economic Development with several other government agencies.

The position was briefly renamed Minister for Economic and Regional Development after being merged with the standalone Regional Economic Development in 2020. In early 2023 the portfolio was split back into two, and its name reverted back to Minister for Economic Development.

Similar ministerial roles under previous governments include the Minister for Enterprise and Commerce (1998–1999), the Minister of Trade and Industry (1972–1988) and the Minister of Industries and Commerce (1894–1972).
