List of stock market crashes and bear markets


# List of stock market crashes and bear markets



This is a **list of stock market crashes and bear markets**. The difference between the two relies on speed (how fast declines occur) and length (how long they last). Stock market crashes are quick and brief, while bear markets are slow and prolonged. Those two do not always happen within the same decline.
