## History

Founded in 1945 by Gerry Livingston as an export packaging company, Livingston began under the name Livingston Lumber & Manufacturing Ltd. Over the first few decades, the company grew as it became heavily involved in warehousing and transportation. Just over 30 years later, in 1978, Livingston launched into the customs brokerage business. Through mergers and acquisitions, this aspect of the company finally overshadowed its warehousing and distribution businesses. In 1981, the company name was changed to Livingston International Inc. Later in the '80s, the company restructured its businesses under the name Livingston Group and operated only its customs brokerage division under the Livingston International banner. Today, all the company's business is conducted under the Livingston International name.
