Early in his career, Cohler worked in China and was a management consultant at McKinsey & Company. He befriended Reid Hoffman and went on to become a founding member of Hoffman's startup LinkedIn. Cohler was vice president and general manager at LinkedIn and was considered CEO Hoffman's right-hand man.

In 2018, it was announced that Cohler would "step back" from Benchmark and not be a part of their next fund.
