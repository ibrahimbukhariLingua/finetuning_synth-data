**Taiwan, China**

Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Zhuo Shi Zhao quoted the report from the Chung-Ang Institute of Economic Research, saying, "With the implementation of the FTA, the export of industrial products (24.7 percent of the total value of industrial products) in Taiwan will be affected by high tariffs, particularly in the industries such as steel, machinery, automobiles, panels, petrochemicals, textiles, and glass."
