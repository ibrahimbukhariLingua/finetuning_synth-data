Electronics and semiconductor manufacturing industry in India


# Electronics and semiconductor manufacturing industry in India



In the early twenty-first century; foreign investment, government regulations and incentives promoted growth in the **Indian electronics industry**. The **semiconductor industry**, which is its most important and resource-intensive sector, profited from the rapid growth in domestic demand. Many industries, including telecommunications, information technology, automotive, engineering, medical electronics, electricity and solar photovoltaic, defense and aerospace, consumer electronics, and appliances, required semiconductors. However, as of 2015, progress was threatened by the talent gap in the Indian sector, since 65 to 70 percent of the market was dependent on imports.


## Electronics industry


### Statistics and trends


#### Market-size

India's electronics sector, which ranks among the world's largest in terms of consumption, is expected to increase from $69.6 billion in 2012 to $400 billion by 2020. It was primarily driven by an increase in demand, which was expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of over 25% during that time.
Imports accounted for 65% of the demand for electrical products in 2013–14. A Frost & Sullivan-IESA data analysis indicates that 60% of total electronic usage can be attributed to five high priority product categories. These are, in descending order, desktop computers (4.39%), laptops (5.54%), mobile phones (38.85%), and flat panel display televisions (7.91%).

The consumer electronics and appliance industry in India, which was valued at $9.7 billion in 2014, is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% to reach $20.6 billion by 2020. Set-top boxes are expected to increase at the quickest rate among consumer electronics, with Y-o-Y growth of 28.8% forecast between 2014 and 2020. Televisions will grow at the rate of 20%, refrigerators at 10%, washing machines at 8–9%, and air conditioners at roughly 6-7%. India's demand for IT devices was projected to be worth $13 billion in 2013. By 2029–2030, it is estimated that India's aerospace and defense (A&D) electronics sector might be valued up to $70 billion, of which $55 billion could come from electronics used in platforms that need to be purchased and the other $70 billion from system-of-system initiatives.


#### Domestic production

In 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15, the total amount of electronic goods produced domestically was ₹164,172 crores, ₹180,454 crores, and ₹190,366 crores, respectively. India's electronics hardware manufacturing sector is expected to generate $104 billion in electronic goods by 2020, up from $32.46 billion in 2013–14. India produced 1.6% of the world's electronics gear in FY13. With 31% of the entire production of electronic goods in India in FY13, the communication and broadcasting equipment industry held a leading position, followed by consumer electronics at 23%. In the April–June quarter of 2015, 24.8% of the cellphones transported into the nation were either assembled or made in India, an increase from 19.9% the quarter before.

Out of the 220 million mobile sets that were shipped in India in 2015–16, 110 million of those units were either manufactured or assembled there in the past year, up from 60 million the year before. The value of mobile handset production increased by 185% in 2015–16, from ₹19,000 crores to ₹54,000 crores. Turning the Make in India initiative into a reality for the electronics and hardware sector was the title of an ASSOCHAM-EY research. It predicted that the Indian electronics and hardware industry will develop at a CAGR of 13%–16% in 2013–18, from a level of $75 billion in 2016 to $112–130 billion by 2018.

In May 2016, an NITI Aayog research stated that India's electronics sector contributes just 1.7% of GDP, but in Taiwan, South Korea, and China, it accounts for 15.5%, 15.1%, and 12.7% of GDP, respectively. India now makes up less than 5% of the global electronics manufacturing sector, with the majority of its electronics production going towards the country's own market.

In 2014, the percentage of localized input/value addition in televisions was approximately 25–30% due to the importation of panels, semiconductors, and glass required for the production of LCD/LED TVs. Due to the importation of the compressor, refrigerant, motor, and coil, the localization of air conditioners was only approximately 30% to 40%. About 35–40% of the parts used in set-top boxes came from within the country. For refrigerators and washing machines, the localized content was approximately 70%. It is stated that in 2016, the percentage of localized value addition created in mobile phone assembly in India was barely 2-8%.

#### Exports and imports

India is a net importer of electronics, with China accounting for the majority of India's imports. Electronics surpassed gold in 2015 and now rank second in terms of value among all imports into the nation, right behind crude oil. India is spending more money on semiconductor imports than on oil, according to research published in 2019 by Professor Vikram Kumar, an emeritus professor of physics at IIT Delhi. According to a Ministry of Commerce and Industry report, one of the six industries that could assist India in reaching over 70% of its target of $1 trillion in goods exports by FY30 is electronics.


#### Exports

The estimated value of India's electronics exports in FY13 was $7.66 billion, down slightly from $8.15 billion in FY12; however, due to the depreciation of the rupee, they increased in INR terms during the same time, rising from ₹44,000 crore to ₹46,300 crore. India's electronics exports were dominated in 2013–14 by the telecom sector, which was followed by computing, consumer electronics, instruments, and electronic components. The increasing demand for Indian electronics items overseas is believed to be mostly driven by advancements in technology and competitive cost-effectiveness. Indian exports of electronic gear nearly doubled in value from ₹109,940 crores in 2009–10 to ₹196,103 crores in 2013–14, measured in rupees. India's electronics exports fell to $6 billion in FY14, accounting for 0.28% of the world's electronics trade.

India recorded a 22.24% growth in electronics exports, exceeding the $20 billion milestone within the nine months of the FY 2023-24. Between April and December 2023, mobile phone exports—which made up 52% of all electronics exports—reached $10.5 billion. Notably, the iPhone became the main export engine during this time, accounting for 35% of all electronics exports and an astounding 70% of all mobile exports from the nation. The value of iPhone exports topped $7 billion only in December 2023. the nearly seven-fold increase in mobile exports, which went from $1.6 billion in FY19 to $11.1 billion in FY23. In the same time frame, total electronics exports increased by almost three times, from $8.4 billion in FY19 to $23.6 billion in FY23.

During their results call for the December quarter in 2023, Indian companies such as Havells, Dixon Technologies, Voltas, and Blue Star stated that they are building a foundation for exports to industrialized nations such as the US and those in Europe. Havells intends to supply air conditioners in the US market after establishing a company there. About 28–30% of Motorola smartphone output is now sent to the US as Dixon Technologies increases its exports of the devices. Appliance retailer Arçelik, which markets appliances in Europe under the Beko name, has placed export orders with Voltas for frost-free refrigerators and dishwashers. India exported $29.12 billion worth of electronics in 2023–24, a 23.6 percent increase over the previous year. The United States, United Arab Emirates, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Italy are the top five export markets for electronics goods.

Critics and detractors of the fab projects currently underway in India, in different conceptual phases, doubt the prospects of success of these capital-intensive projects, pointing to various reasons like marginal profitability due to overcapacity of output in a saturated and fiercely competed fab market, noncompetence of these particular fabs in terms of cost and performance related to the dimensions of CMOS nodes even in attracting domestic end-use industries which have access to the more sophisticated fabs outside the country, cost prohibitive maintenance and upgrades needed every few years to weather obsolescence, nonavailability of domestically procurable semiconductor-grade materials in absence of complementing ancillary manufacturing industries and other resource-intensive strings attached to such projects, including land acquisition requirements, necessity uninterrupted deionised water and power supplies, supply of critical gases such as nitrogen and argon, absence of skilled labour force and drain of an already inadequate number of experienced domestic talent pool in electronic engineering and R&D possessing expertise to overcome the barriers of related sensitive technologies for mass production towards other attractive sectors in absence of a major Indian player in the electronics sector, especially in a developing country like India, which is still grappling with infrastructural bottlenecks.

However, the endorsers of the fab projects, such as AMD, which partnered with HSMC for the fab project in Gujarat, stress the strategic need of developing the fabs as part of an end-to-end electronics manufacturing base in India which imports billions of dollars worth of even lower-end semiconductor nodes of 90 nm and above each year.
Relevant circles within India have been advocating for investment by the central government with a long term strategic vision in the revolutionising fields of Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) based non silica semiconductor foundry and fab because of their wide ranged use like High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) made from GaN in power electronics both for civilian and military applications which can switch at high speed and can handle high power and high temperature without needing any cooling and HgCdTe based high quality sensors for military space requirements.
