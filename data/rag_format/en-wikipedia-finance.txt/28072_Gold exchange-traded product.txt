Gold exchange-traded product


# Gold exchange-traded product



**Gold exchange-traded products** are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end funds (CEFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that are used to own gold as an investment. Gold exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Bombay Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the Paris Bourse, and the New York Stock Exchange. Each gold ETF, ETN, and CEF has a different structure outlined in its prospectus. Some such instruments do not necessarily hold physical gold. For example, gold ETNs generally track the price of gold using derivatives.

The funds pay their annual expenses such as storage, insurance, and management fees to the sponsor by selling a small amount of gold; therefore, the amount of gold in each share will gradually decline over time. The annual fee charged by State Street Corporation as sponsor of SPDR Gold Shares, the largest gold-backed fund in the world, is 0.40% of the assets in the fund.

In some countries, gold ETFs represent a way to avoid the sales tax or the Value-added tax which would apply to physical gold gold coins and gold bars.

In the United States, sales of a gold ETF that holds the physical commodity are treated as sales of the underlying commodity and thus are taxed at the 28% long term and 35% short term capital gains tax rate for collectibles, rather than the rates applied to stock sales.

Owners of these instruments may be at risk of the failure of the trustee or custodian.
