## Plot

Muskaan Bano, a young woman brimming with life and dreams in a small Andhra Pradesh village, found her world shattered when her parents, manipulated by greed, married her off to a wealthy Arab man. Her hopes for a happy marriage were quickly extinguished. Instead, she endured exploitation and was discarded within a week through a swift divorce. Determined to fight for justice, Muskaan and her family embarked on a long legal battle against this man who had so callously used her, for eight long years, but this battle ended in disappointment when the man's lawyer bribed the judge, leading to his acquittal and further shattering Muskaan's faith in justice.

Crushed by this betrayal of the legal system and the weight of her circumstances, Muskaan found herself in the sprawling, unforgiving city of Mumbai. Here, she was trapped in the brutal reality of the red-light district of Hyderabad, where she was forced into prostitution and faced the dehumanizing realities of the sex trade. Every day was a struggle, a testament to the cruelty she had endured. However, fate intervened when a compassionate police officer, Sawant, noticed Muskaan's spirit. He introduced her to Juicy, a shrewd pimp who managed a network of high-class escorts. Juicy took Muskaan under her wing, changing her name to Mallika and, with the help of Lisa and Isha, helped transform her into a sophisticated and sought-after call girl.

As Mallika, Muskaan experienced a different side of the same world. She met Babloo, a criminal, who was captivated by her, but love was not her priority. Her world took another turn when she witnessed the violent murder of Isha, her friend in the trade. Following the events of the tragedy, she and Lisa were summoned to Dubai by Yashwant Anna, a powerful don, setting the stage for a fateful confrontation with the man who had wronged her years ago - her ex-Arab husband. With her old wounds ripped open, Mallika's desire for revenge grew, hardening her resolve to not only survive but to seek vengeance on those who had caused her so much pain. Now, the fight wasn't just for her survival but also to settle scores.
