Charities Act 2011


# Charities Act 2011



The **Charities Act 2011** (c. 25) is a UK act of Parliament. It consolidated the bulk of the Charities Act 2006, outstanding provisions of the Charities Act 1993, and various other enactments.


## Repeals

Legislation repealed in its entirety by the Charities Act 2011 included

* Recreational Charities Act 1958 (6 & 7 Eliz. 2. c. 17),
* **Charities Act 1993** (c. 10),
* **Charities (Amendment) Act 1995** (c. 48),
* Charities Act 1993 (Substitution of Sums) Order 1995 (SI 1995/2696),
* Charities Act 2006 (Charitable Companies Audit and Group Accounts Provisions) Order 2008 (SI 2008/527), and
* Charities (Pre-consolidation Amendments) Order 2011 (SI 2011/1396).

Amendments were made to other legislation. It replaced most of the **Charities Act 1992** (c. 41) and Charities Act 2006 (c. 50).


## Independent examination

Section 145(1)(a) allowed for charities' financial accounts to be independently examined where a full audit is not required. An "independent examiner" is a person not connected to the charity who is "reasonably believed by the trustees to have the requisite ability and practical experience to carry out a competent examination of the accounts".


## Social investment by charities

Additional provisions were added by the **Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Act 2016** granting a "general power" to charities to make "social investments", that is actions undertaken both to further the organisation's charitable aims and to make a financial surplus. In this context a charity's actions do not need to be financial "investments" as the term would generally be understood.
