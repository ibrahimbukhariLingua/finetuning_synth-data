## Personal

On 27 June 1895 Rutter Clarke married Edith Marion Sargood (1867–1952), a daughter of Sir Frederick Sargood. Their children were:

* Geoffrey Rutter Clarke (3 June 1896 – 1971) married Susan May "Susie" Pender of Naracoorte, South Australia on 28 March 1923.
* Kenneth Sargood Rutter Clarke (2 February 1898 – 23 October 1955)
* Audrey (3 April 1903 – 1925)

Mr Rutter Clarke was fond of sport and was a keen cricketer and tennis player. He wrote interesting articles on international cricket and horse racing for newspapers such as *The Barrier Miner*.

In 1907 he built a magnificent home, "Merriwa" on Orrong Road, Toorak, under architect Walter Richmond Butler, and established a large and exquisitely planned garden (he was a keen gardener, especially of roses) which featured an expanse of indigenous flowering plants unmatched outside Botanical Gardens. In February 1917 the car he was driving on High Street, St Kilda, struck and killed William Fitzsimmons, who had jumped down from the seat of his lorry into the path of the oncoming vehicle. The following September he sold "Meeriwa" to Mrs. Charles Moore, the wealthy owner of Charles Moore and Co. His next home was "Myoora", previously the home of Robert Harper, MLA, close to the Toorak tram terminus. Dame Nellie Melba had been a tenant of this stately mansion for five months in 1902.

His palatial weekender, "Ellerslie" at Mornington, Victoria previously owned by Sir Frederick Sargood, was destroyed by fire in April 1908. Arson was suspected. A new residence was built and the property on 30 acres was sold in 1920.

His last residence was "Braemar", Grandview Grove, Armadale.
