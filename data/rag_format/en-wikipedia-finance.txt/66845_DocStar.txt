## History

DocStar was formerly known as **BitWise Designs Inc.** and was founded in 1985, by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute students John Botti and Ira Whitman. In 1992, BitWise began public trading under the stock symbol BTWS. In 1994, the document imaging division of BitWise was founded as DocStar.

In March 2001, BitWise designs officially changed its name to AuthentiDate Holding Corporation and began trading under the NASDAQ symbol ADAT. AuthentiDate was the first company to gain official USPS Electronic Postmark (EPM). At present, Authentidate remains the official EPM provider to the United States Postal Service. In 2005, AuthentiDate moved its headquarters from Schenectady, NY, to Berkeley Heights, NJ. The DocStar division remained in Schenectady.

On January 3, 2017, DocStar was purchased by Epicor Software Corporation. Astria Solutions Group acquired DocStar in June 2007, from AuthentiDate Holding Corp.
