Third series of the renminbi


# Third series of the renminbi



The **third series of Renminbi** banknotes was introduced since April 15, 1962. Unlike the second series of the renminbi, it did not have a ¥3 banknote and added ¥0.1, ¥0.2, ¥0.5 and ¥1 coins. For the next two decades, the second and third series banknotes were used concurrently. The third series was phased out over the 1990s and then was recalled completely on July 1, 2000, a date valid for all of the denominations with only one date provided.
