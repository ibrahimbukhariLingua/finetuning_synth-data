## History

Shepherd and Wedderburn's history can be traced back to 1768, when David Stewart of Stewarthall was admitted as a Writer to the Signet. Once admitted, Stewart took on an apprentice in William Patrick, and they later practised together under the name of Stewart & Patrick WS.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Following Stewart's death in 1823, Patrick assumed James McEwan of Bardrochat and John Carment, as partners and the firm became Patrick, McEwan & Carment WS. In 1878, after the deaths of Patrick and McEwan, Carment partnered with Joseph Robert Maclagan Wedderburn and Graham Gilbert Watson, and the firm evolved into Carment Wedderburn & Watson WS. Carment Wedderburn & Watson WS merged with Guild & Shepherd WS in 1922, and the firm became Shepherd and Wedderburn.

Shepherd and Wedderburn has since expanded into Glasgow, London, and most recently Aberdeen, when the firm acquired The Commercial Law Partnership in 2016. It also acquired 158-year-old Scottish law firm Tods Murray out of administration in October 2014. Shepherd and Wedderburn now has a total headcount of 492, including 79 partners.

The acquisition of Scottish IFA firm Muirfield in October 2012 saw the launch of Shepherd and Wedderburn's independent financial adviser practice, known today as Shepherd and Wedderburn Financial.

In 2014, Shepherd and Wedderburn acquired Tods Murray LLP, who had appointed administrators.

Shepherd and Wedderburn's Managing Partner, Andrew Blain, was appointed in April 2019.
