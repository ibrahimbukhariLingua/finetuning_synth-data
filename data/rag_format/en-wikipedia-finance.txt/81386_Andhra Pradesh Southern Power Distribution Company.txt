On 2 June 2014, due to bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh Anantapur and Kurnool districts were added to the Southern Power Distribution Company of AP Ltd.

AP Power Sector Reforms envisage creation of Distribution Companies as Government Undertakings. The Andhra Pradesh Gazette No.37 published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh on Friday 31 March 2000 declared formally formation of Distribution Companies. In this process, Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company was formed for the following six districts of Andhra Pradesh. The corporate office and headquarters of APSPDCL is at Tirupati City

Quality power at economic rates acts a catalyst in transforming the state by fostering growth in agricultural, industrial and commercial areas while meeting the increasing domestic demand. On Feb 1, 1999, Government of Andhra Pradesh initiated the first phase of reforms and restructuring in AP's power sector by unbundling APSEB into APGENCO and APTRANSCO to cater to Generation and Transmission & Distribution respectively. APTRANSCO was further reorganized into four distribution companies to cater to the needs to the different districts of AP.

APSPDCL was formed on April 1, 2000 to serve Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts.

After the bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh into the two new states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on 2 June-2014, two more districts Anantapur and Kurnool were added to the Southern Power Distribution Company of AP Ltd.
