# Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company



**One Communications Guyana** (formerly Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company) is a fixed local exchange carrier (LEC) based in Guyana, South America. It is the largest provider of telecommunication services in Guyana with a subscriber base exceeding 300,000 in a country with a population of about 700,000. Its parent company is the Atlantic Tele-Network.


## History

On June 18, 1990, the Government of Guyana (GOG) and Atlantic Tele-Network (ATN) signed an agreement that would create a new, private limited liability company, GTT. ATN purchased 80 percent of the issued share capital and the GOG retained 20 percent of the company. The GOG later sold these shares to Hong Kong Golden Telecom Company Limited.

Consistent with this agreement, the previous telecommunications provider, government-owned Guyana Telecommunication Corporation (GTC) was dissolved, and, on January 28, 1991, the new private sector company, GTT, commenced operations under new management as a subsidiary of ATN.

GTT was granted licenses under the Post and Telegraph Act (Cap 47:01 of the Laws of Guyana) for:

1. The exclusive provision of public, radio and pay station telephone services and national and international voice and data transmission;
2. The exclusive sale of advertising in any directories of telephone subscribers;
3. The exclusive provision of switched and non-switched service supported by facilities constructed over public right-of-way; and
4. The non-exclusive provision of a) terminal and customer premises equipment, and b) telefax, telex and telegraph services, and cellular radio telephone service.

As a private sector utility provider, GTT's operations and conduct are regulated by the Telecoms Act of 1990, the Public Utilities Commission Act of 1990, and the GOG/ATN Agreement.


## Services

Initially GTT’s focus was on the provision of local fixed line, long-distance and international voice calls. Notably, its primary source of revenue came from premium rate numbers dialled from the United States, of which estimates of between 35% and 90% were for phone sex lines. These services are used today, however not as extensively as before.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
