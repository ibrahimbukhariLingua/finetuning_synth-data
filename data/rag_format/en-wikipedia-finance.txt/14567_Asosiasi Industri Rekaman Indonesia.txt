## Repercussions of unauthorized recording

Copyright infringement is not a new phenomenon in Indonesia. Before 1988, all recordings sold in Indonesia were unauthorized. But in the 1990s, the number was reduced to 20%, with retail value of unlicensed recordings in 1995, estimated at US$15 million. In the early 2000s, the infringement rate was increased back to a higher levels, which was at 55% in 2001, and 85% in 2003. Usually, infringement affects domestic artists in particular.
