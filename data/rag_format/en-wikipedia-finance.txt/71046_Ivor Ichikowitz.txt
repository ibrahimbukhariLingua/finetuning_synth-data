## Controversy

Ichikowitz has been criticised for being a "close ally" of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), and for providing President Jacob Zuma with an aircraft to use for an ANC fundraising and business trip to Lebanon and Kazakhstan. Another flight by Zuma to the United States on an aircraft owned by Ichikowitz in 2011 caused considerable controversy when the cost (R6.3 million) was questioned in parliament. The official presidential aircraft, operated by the South African Air Force, was not available for the flight.

Ichikowitz has also been criticised for his involvement in the controversial Oil-for-Food Programme in the aftermath of the Gulf War.

During September 2020 Ichikowitz and his company Paramount were listed in the FinCEN Files for various SAR (Suspicious Activety Reports) by the US Dept of Treasury for suspicious and corrupt transactions including possible money laundering exceeding $250m.


## Philanthropic interests

Ichikowitz is the founder of the Ichikowitz Family Foundation, established in 2010. The Foundation is actively involved in wildlife conservation of endangered species, especially the protection of Africa's rhinos and elephant population.


## Political views

Regarding the South Africa v. Israel (Genocide Convention), Ichikowitz criticized the South African government for hypocrisy and double standards, recalling that South Africa failed to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during his visit to South Africa, despite Bashir being accused of genocide and wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), and did not condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reluctant to comply with the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin.


## Personal life

Ichikowitz is married with two children.
