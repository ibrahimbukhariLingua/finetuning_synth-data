## Work

Yezer's research has merited inclusion in more than a dozen journals, and he serves as principal editor for the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association monograph series. He served on the National Research Council's Panel on Disaster Needs in the Social Sciences which led to the publication of *The Economic Consequences of a Catastrophic Earthquake*.

In 2013, Yezer published the textbook, "Economics of Crime and Enforcement". "This text is designed for use in a course on the economics of crime in a variety of settings. Assuming only a previous course in basic microeconomics, this innovative book is strongly linked to the new theoretical and empirical journal literature. Showing the power of microeconomics in action, Yezer covers a wide array of topics. There are chapters on the following topics: benefit-cost and the imprisonment decision, enforcement games, juvenile crime, private enforcement, economics of 3 strikes law, broken windows strategies, police profiling, and crime in developing countries. There are also separate chapters on guns, drugs, and capital punishment."
