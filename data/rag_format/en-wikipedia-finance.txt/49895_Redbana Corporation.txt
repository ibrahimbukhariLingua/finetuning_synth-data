## Redbana Divisions

There was another Redbana website in Taiwan (now renamed T3 Taiwan), found at redbana.tw. Redbana released a global site on August 27, 2009. Redbana Global released "Camon Hero" the same day the website was live. On March 5, 2010, Redbana Global announced that the URL redbanaglobal.com would no longer exist as of April 6 and will be moved to www.t3fun.com. They have announced they will transfer all data of "Camon Hero", but there will be a new Terms of Service and Privacy policy. They have also announced three new additions: "Grand Mer", "Mythos", and "워크라이 (Warcry)".

Redbana Philippines is a distributor of Hanbit Soft games such as Tantra and WYD. This leads to the other the logo, Gamebana. It was established to be a Global game distributor rather than one particular part of the world, but no longer exists. This division has no relation to T3 Entertainment.


### Mythos North-American Development [closed]

Although the Mythos MMORPG closed beta phase of development was announced to be coming "very soon" by Redbana on their forums around December 2009, no date or real feedback from the company has yet been released. There were periodic attempts by Redbana representatives and forum moderators throughout 2010 to revive interest in the upcoming game, but eventually the community at large grew steadily dissatisfied and most stopped participating on the Mythos forum. A long overdue update from Redbana on Jan 7, 2011 stipulated that the North-American version is still in the works, although no clear release date has yet been mentioned.
