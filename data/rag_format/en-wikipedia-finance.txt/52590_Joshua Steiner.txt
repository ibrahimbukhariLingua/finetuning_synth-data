## Department of Treasury

Previously Steiner was Chief of Staff of the U.S. Treasury Department in the Clinton Administration, where he was responsible for managing the Secretary of Treasury's staff and served as his advisor on domestic and international policy as well as management and communications issues. Steiner came into national news as a result of the Whitewater investigations where he testified before Congress on the contacts between the Treasury and the Clinton White House. He testified before the Senate Banking Committee on August 2, 1994 claiming that he had made "misrepresentations" in his own diary. He was quickly branded as "the kid who lied to his own diary" as his testimony was largely seen as an attempt to cover for the Clinton White House.
