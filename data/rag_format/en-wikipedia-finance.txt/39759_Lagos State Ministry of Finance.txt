Lagos State Ministry of Finance


# Lagos State Ministry of Finance



The **Lagos State Ministry of Finance** is a ministry of the Government of Lagos State, Nigeria, with responsibility for planning and implementing the state's financial policies.


## History

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development was established in April 1968. Economic Development was separated from the Ministry of Finance in 1995, and the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget was formed.

The Finance Ministry was then divided into six directorates: Personnel Management, Planning, Research and Statistics, and Finance and Supplies, as well as three professional directorates: Public Finance, Computer Services, and Central Internal Audit.

Finance Headquarters, the State Treasury Office, and the Board of Internal Revenue were the three agencies that made up the Ministry of Finance upon its beginning.

In 2006, the Board of Internal Revenue, which is charged with collecting tax-related Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) for the State Government, was upgraded and given semi-autonomous status in order to improve revenue production, transparency and accountability.

In 2005, the PF/DMO, which had previously been a Ministry Department, was also elevated to the rank of Agency, with a Permanent Secretary as its head.

The PF/DMO was combined with the Office of Finance in 2015 as part of the current government's reorganization, and it continues to perform its statutory tasks. A permanent secretary leads the Office of Finance, which is one of the Ministry of Finance's arms. The Ministry's Headquarters serves as its coordinating arm.
