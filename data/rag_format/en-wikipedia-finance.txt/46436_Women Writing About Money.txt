## Reception

Amanda Gilroy, of Romanticism, reviewed the book saying, "These cavils aside, Copeland provides a wealth of contextual material. He has undertaken the type of assiduous research that makes Women Writing About Money a fascinating history of the relations between economic details and gender in the period. It will be up to other Romantic scholars to investigate further the insight that 'systems of consumption and systems of discourse are not by any means independent of one another." It won a prize for One of Choice's Outstanding Academic Books for 1995.
