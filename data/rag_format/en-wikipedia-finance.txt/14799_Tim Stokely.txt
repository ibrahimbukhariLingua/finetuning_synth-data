# Tim Stokely



**Timothy Christopher Stokely** (born July 1983) is a British businessman and the founder and former CEO of the internet site OnlyFans. He officially stepped down in December 2021.


## Early life

Tim Stokely was born in Harlow, Essex, in July 1983, the youngest of four children of Guy Stokely, a retired ex-Barclays investment banker. He has a degree from Anglia Ruskin University.


## Career

Stokely's first businesses were the adult performance websites GlamWorship and Customs4U, and a site to connect customers to tradespeople. He founded OnlyFans in 2016 alongside his older brother, Thomas Stokely, and with the help of a Â£10,000 loan from his father, Guy, who told him, "Tim, this is going to be the last one". His brother is the company's chief operating officer and his father is head of finance. He sought to avoid the mistakes of his earlier sites by building in a referral system that gave third parties an incentive to recruit new content creators to the site.

Stokely cites the investor Warren Buffett and his book *Warren Buffett on Business* as one of his influences.

Stokely sold a 75 percent stake in OnlyFans' parent company Fenix International to Leonid Radvinsky in 2018. On 23 December 2021, Tim Stokely stepped down as CEO of OnlyFans, and was succeeded by Indian-American businesswoman Amrapali Gan. Keily Blair replaced Gan in July 2023.

Stokely lives in a "gated mansion with a cinema and sauna" in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. He subscribes to two OnlyFans content creators, James Haskell and Chris Robshaw, which reflects his interest in rugby.
