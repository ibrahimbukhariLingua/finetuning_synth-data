Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild


# Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild



**Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild** (29 April 1936 – 26 February 2024), was a British peer, investment banker and member of the Rothschild banking family. Rothschild held important roles in business and British public life, and was active in charitable and philanthropic areas.

He was the eldest son of Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild. Raised in a background that intertwined Jewish heritage with the tenets of Orthodox Judaism through his mother's conversion, Rothschild's education spanned from Eton College to Christ Church, Oxford, where he performed well in history. His early life was marked by membership of the Bullingdon Club and familial connections, including half-siblings Emma Rothschild and Amschel Rothschild.

Rothschild's business career started at N M Rothschild & Sons in London, though a familial dispute led to his departure in 1980. Despite relinquishing his stake in the family bank, he maintained influence through the Rothschild Investment Trust, now RIT Capital Partners plc, among other ventures. Notable business activities included founding J. Rothschild Assurance Group with Mark Weinberg and participating in high-profile bids and partnerships. His tenure as Deputy Chairman of BSkyB Television and involvement with RHJ International and Blackstone Inc. highlighted Rothschild's diverse business interests, leading to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order honour in 2020, for services to the Duchy of Cornwall.

Rothschild was married to Serena Mary Dunn, with whom he had four children, continuing the Rothschild legacy. His philanthropic efforts were extensive, chairing and contributing to art and heritage organizations, notably the National Gallery and the Heritage Lottery Fund in the UK. Rothschild's participation in restoring Waddesdon Manor and engagement with the Butrint Foundation in Albania showed his interest to cultural preservation. His chairmanship of Yad Hanadiv reflected his commitment to philanthropy in Israel. Under his leadership, the organization went beyond funding national landmarks and began to focus on education initiatives, environmental pursuits and advancing equal opportunity for Israel's Arab minority.


## Early life and education

Born at Merton Hall in Cambridge on 29 April 1936, Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild was the eldest son of Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild, by his first wife Barbara Judith Rothschild (née Hutchinson).

Rothschild was educated at Eton College and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a First in history, tutored by Hugh Trevor-Roper. At Oxford he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. Emma Rothschild is his half-sister and Amschel Rothschild was his half-brother.


## Business career

He was also a Member of the council for the Duchy of Cornwall for the Prince of Wales and a member of the International Advisory Board of The Blackstone Group.

In the 1990s, he was chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund, responsible for distributing the proceeds of the National Lottery to the heritage sector, an influential post which oversaw the distribution of £1.2 billion in grants.

As a private project, he carried out the restoration of Spencer House, one of the finest surviving 18th century London townhouses, adjacent to his own offices.

In 1993 he joined with John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover, to set up the Butrint Foundation to record and conserve the archaeological site of Butrint in Albania, close to his holiday home on Corfu. Rothschild remained Chairman of the Butrint Foundation up until his death.

He was a major benefactor of the restoration of Waddesdon Manor through a private family charitable trust and, in an unusual arrangement, had been given authority by the National Trust to run Waddesdon Manor as a semi-independent operation.
