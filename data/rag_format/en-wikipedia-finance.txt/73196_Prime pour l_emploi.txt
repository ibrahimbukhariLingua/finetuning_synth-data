Prime pour l'emploi


# Prime pour l'emploi



The **Prime pour l'emploi** (**PPE**) was a French tax credit aimed at reducing the impact of falling Revenu de solidarité active (welfare benefits) for people returning to work. Implemented in 2001 by the government of Lionel Jospin, it was replaced by the prime d'activité in 2015.

In 2008, 8.7 million working people received the tax credit. The average amount was €36 per month.


## Amount

The amount depends on whether a person is single or in a couple and whether the income per person is between €3,473 and €17,451. The amount increases between the lower limit and €12,475 and then decreases until revenue reaches the upper limit.

| Annual Revenue | Tax credit in % of income |
| --- | --- |
| €3,743 to €12,475 | 7.7% |
| €12,475 to €17,451 | 19.3% of the difference between the salary and the upper limit |
