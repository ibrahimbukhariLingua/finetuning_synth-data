2020 Union budget of India


# 2020 Union budget of India



The **2020 Union Budget of India** (ISO: *2020 Ke liye Bhārat Kā Saṅghīya Bajaṭ*) was presented by the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman on 1 February 2020, as her second budget. This is the second budget of Narendra Modi-led NDA government's second term. The Economic Survey for 2019–2020 was released on 31 January 2020, a day before the budget. Before the budget speech the report of the 15th Finance Commission was tabled by the Finance Minister.

The central ideas of the Budget are "Aspirational India, Economic development, A Caring Society". These three broad themes are connected by governance that is corruption free and a financial sector that is clean and sound.

Notably, Nirmala Sitharaman read out a Kashmiri poem during the budget speech in the Parliament, a Tamil couplet written by Thiruvalluvar and a verse from the Sanskrit work *Raghuvamsam* as well as a French phrase. Some of the aims announced were "improving digital governance, physical quality of life, disaster resilience and social security reach".

At 2 hours and 41 minutes, the budget speech was the longest ever delivered by a Finance Minister of India. Nirmala Sitharaman is also only the second woman to present the budget for a second time after Indira Gandhi.


## History

The Union Budget is the annual financial report of India; an estimate of income and expenditure of the government on a periodical basis. As per Article 112 of the Indian Constitution, it is a compulsory task of the government. The first budget of India was presented on 18 February 1860 by Scotsman James Wilson. The first Union Budget of Independent India was presented by RK Shanmukham Chetty on 26 November 1947.


## Background

The Union budget in 2020 was presented in a backdrop of a slowing down of the Indian economy with estimated GDP growth for 2019–20 being at an 11-year low of 5%. Factors such as the IL&FS (shadow banker, NBFC) crisis contributed to the slowdown; as well as international financial markets issues such as the China–United States trade war. In January 2020 Western Asset Management Company has reduced its government bond holdings following the atmosphere in the country due to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the situation in Kashmir which are affecting the economic spirit. Investments in India will be shifted to other countries such as China and Malaysia.

According to the *Economic Times*, the BSE Sensex and Nifty have given positive returns only thrice in the last decade during the pre-Budget week, while offering positive returns five times in the post-budget week. In 2016, the markets gained 7.2% in the post-Budget week.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala said that he "is not looking forward to any big-bang announcement in the forthcoming Union Budget, but expects the government to do some actual work". In January 2020 Nobel Laureates Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo said: "The critical problem in the Indian economy is demand." Abhijit Banerjee said "we should forget about Budget deficits and meeting targets. We should even forget about inflation targeting. Let the economy rip a bit."

The Prime Minister of India invited people to share their ideas and suggestions related to the Union Budget on MyGov.in.

## Reactions

Reaction to the budget was mixed.


### Political

Prime minister Narendra Modi made a statement saying that the budget has both "vision and action".

Among the opposition members, P. Chidambaram, the former Union Finance Minister of India, said that the "government has given up on reviving economy". Also, with reference to the budget allocation for Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, Chidambaram also said that money can't replace freedom. Rahul Gandhi criticized the budget for not providing any real solution to solve the unemployment issue. Sitaram Yechury of CPI(M) said that the budget does nothing to rid "people's miseries". Mamata Banerjee said that she was "shocked and appalled" with the governments plan related to the heritage of the country. T. M. Thomas Isaac, the finance minister of Kerala said the budget was a "war cry" against the state; this was because the budget for the state had been reduced.


### Academics

According to University of Kalyani economist Byasdeb Dasgupta, the budget "served the interests of finance at the cost of the real economy without considering the ongoing stagnation in the real economy, steep rises in the rate of unemployment and informalization of the economy". He especially opposed the abolition of the dividend distribution tax and the cuts to corporate taxes.


### Private sector

Moody's Investors Service has said that the "budget highlights the challenges to fiscal consolidation". PWCs noted that there were "some positives from a tax perspective". NASSCOM also reaffirms this and notes that the tax harassment for taxpayers was something the government was committed to remove. Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, rated the Budget "below par". Swaminathan Aiyer called the budget "reasonable". Satish Reddy said that the budget showed the continued focus of the government's in healthcare.


### Stock markets

As the Union budget was presented in the parliament, Nifty fell by over 3% (373.95 points) while Sensex fell by more than 2% (1000 points). Economic Times reports some reasons for this including lack of sops for the automobile or real estate, confusion over new income tax slabs, high divestment targets [₹2,100 billion (equivalent to ₹2.5 trillion or US$30 billion in 2023)] and abolition of dividend distribution tax.
