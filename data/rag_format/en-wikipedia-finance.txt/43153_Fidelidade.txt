## History

The history of the company dates back to 1808 with the foundation of Bonança. In 1835 Companhia de Seguros Fidelidade is founded. Over the centuries, there have been several moments that have marked the activity of the companies that are at its origin: mergers, nationalization and later privatization, expansion into new markets, and adoption of new strategies.

The name Fidelidade Mundial thus results from the merger in 2002 of the insurance companies Fidelidade and Mundial Confiança. This was followed in 2012 by the merger of Fidelidade Mundial and Império Bonança, giving rise to Fidelidade - Companhia de Seguros, S.A..

In 2011, Fidelidade started its activity in Angola by purchasing the majority share of Universal Seguros, SA. It rebranded the company to Fidelidade Angola in 2017.

In 2014, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun International was chosen by the Portuguese state to buy Fidelidade which was by then an asset of Caixa Geral de Depósitos, a Portuguese state-run bank.
