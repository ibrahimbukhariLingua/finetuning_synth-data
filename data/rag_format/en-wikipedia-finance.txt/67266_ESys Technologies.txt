However, in 2006 Seagate Technology ended its distributorship relationship with eSys Technologies after it denied Seagate Technologies the right to conduct a third party audit of its accounts.

That same month eSys Technologies announced a global distribution agreement with Samsung and reported to have 117 offices in 38 countries.
