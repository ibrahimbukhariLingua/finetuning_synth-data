## History

Liberty National traces its origin back to August 27, 1900, when its predecessor was founded as the Heralds of Liberty, a fraternal organization founded on the principles of respect for the law, observance of cardinal Christian virtues, loyalty to government, and practical exemplification of brotherhood.

Later in June 1921, the name was changed to Liberty Life Assurance Company by deputy insurance commissioner Robert Davison and Frank Samford. In 1929, LNL was incorporated as a stock company and its name was changed to Liberty National Life Insurance Company.

The Liberty National Holding Company, created in 1979, expanded by acquiring United American, along with Globe Life and Accident Insurance Company and American Income Life. In the 1980s, the Liberty National Insurance Holding Company became Torchmark Corporation which then became Globe Life on August 8, 2019.
