## History

The company was founded by Gary Dudley and Charlie Amato in 1976 in Dallas. The founders had met at elementary school and had reunited in the 1970s when they were both selling credit life insurance before deciding to start SWBC.

In 2007 the company expanded to Bermuda, setting up SWBC Re, a re-insurance business.
