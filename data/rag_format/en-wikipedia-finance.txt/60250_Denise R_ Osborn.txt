# Denise R. Osborn



**Denise Rae Osborn** (born 23 November 1948) is an Australian and British economist who currently works as the Secretary-General at the Royal Economic Society and as an Emeritus Professor of Econometrics at the University of Manchester. Her principal research interests have been in applied Time-Series modelling, particularly in seasonality in economic variables and dynamic modelling of macroeconomic relationships. Osborn has over 70 research publications in referred academic journals including *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*, *Journal of Econometrics*, *Journal of Applied Econometrics*, *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society*, and *Journal of the American Statistical Association*.


## Education

Denise R. Osborn attended the University of Sydney in 1966, completing the Bachelor of Economics with First Class Honours in 1970, and the Master of Economics in 1972. After that, she left Australia and went to the United Kingdom. She attended the London School of Economics and obtained her PhD in econometrics under the supervision of Professor Kenneth Frank Wallis in 1976 with her thesis title: *Time series analysis and dynamic specification in econometric models, with an application to the Australian wool market*.


## Career

In 1972, Osborn started as a Teaching Fellow at the Department of Economic Statistics in the University of Sydney. While she was pursuing her PhD, she worked as a research Officer for the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London from 1975 to 1977. After that, Osborn arrived at the University of Manchester and took up the role as a Lecturer in Econometrics from 1977 to 1989. She was then promoted and worked as a Senior Lecturer from 1989 to 1992. In 1992, Osborn became a Professor of Econometrics as she was awarded with a personal Chair, and four years later in 1996, she was promoted to the Robert Ottley Chair in Econometrics and became a Robert Ottley Professor of Econometrics. In 2013, Osborn switched up the role and became a part-time Professor of Econometrics until 2015. Since then, she has been an Emeritus Professor of Econometrics at the University of Manchester. At the University of Manchester, Osborn has also held various of positions, including the Interim Head of the School of Social Sciences from September to December 2003, the Director of Research for the School of Economic Studies from 1994 to 1997, the Head of the School of Economic Studies from 1997 to 2002, and the Head of Economics from 2009 to 2011.

While primarily working at the University of Manchester, Osborn has had other visiting positions. In May 2004, she arrived at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics in Monash University as an Academic Visitor. She was also the Adjunct Professor in the Department of Economics at Australian National University from July to September 2006. After, Osborn visited the School of Economics and Finance, University of Tasmania as a Visiting Fellow in 2012, and as a Visiting Professor from 2013 to 2016.


## External roles


### Royal Economic Society (RES)

Osborn was the Conference Chair of RES in 1994, and from 1994 to 1999, she acted as a member of council and executive committee. Osborn was the Inaugural Chair of Women's Committee the Council from 1996 to 1998. In 1998, she became a member of the Conference of Heads of University Departments of Economics (CHUDE) steering Committee until 2003, and again in 2007. From 2004 to 2006, she participated as the Chairperson of CHUDE and she was also a member of Women's Committee from 2007 to 2011. In 2015, Osborn took over the role as the Secretary-General at the Royal Economic Society, and she is the first woman Secretary-General since 1890.


### Research Assessment Exercises (RAE)

Osborn participated at the UK Research Assessment Exercises 2001 (REA2001) as the Vice Chair and member of the Economics and Econometrics Panel. In the UK RAE 2008, she was originally joined as member of both the Economics and Econometrics, and the Business and Management Studies Sub-Panel. But later, due to the stepped down of Professor David Greenaway, Osborn became the Chair of Economics and Econometrics Sub-Panel and the member of Main Panel I.

Osborn also participated at the Hong Kong Research Assessment Exercises in 2014, as a Deputy Panel Convenor of Business and Economics.
