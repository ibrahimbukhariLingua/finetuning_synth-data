Plug-in electric vehicles in Iceland


# Plug-in electric vehicles in Iceland



The adoption of **plug-in electric vehicles in Iceland** is the second highest in the world after Norway, and fully supported by the government. As of 2022, the market share of electric vehicles in Iceland is around 60%, the second-highest in the world behind Norway. Around 14% of the country's passenger car fleet is electrified as of 2022.

Iceland is well suited to the adoption of EVs as driving distances are relatively short, the country has cheap, surplus renewable energy (99.98% renewable electricity in 2022) and has to import all of its fossil fuels. Electric vehicles (EVs) are a key component of the country's environmental policy and compliance with the Paris Agreement, with road transport contributing 20% of Iceland's total greenhouse gas emssions. The Icelandic government plans to ban the import of petrol and diesel cars after 2030.


## History

In 1979, a university engineering professor from the University of Iceland, Gísli Jónsson obtained funding from the university to purchase a Jet Industries Electra Van 500 from the United States. The 4 passenger van had a 50–80 km range and used 16 6-volt batteries. He was an advocate for electric vehicle adoption and the purpose of the van was to test the vehicle in Icelandic conditions and demonstrate the use of electric vehicles in Iceland. It was eventually sold in 1983 and used as a service vehicle for an aluminium smelter and later on a farm in Mývatnssveit.

In 1992, a short lived committee was formed by the Minister for Industry to investigate the viability of electric vehicles in Iceland, it did not achieve its goals and was shut down in 1994. A Peugot 106 electric vehicle was imported in March 1998 by the Reykjavík Electric Utility (now Orkuveita Reykjavíkur) as a demonstration vehicle.

There were a handful of other demonstration and experimental EVs imported in the 1990s, including 2 in Akureyri by the postal service and local utility as well as one by Landsvirkjun. There were only around 10 registered EVs throughout the 1990s until 2010.

Tax incentives were introduced in 2012, and with the introduction of more mass market vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf and the BMW i3, EV sales saw exponential growth. 2013 was the first year EV market share surpassed 1%, increasing to around 11% by 2017

EV market share grew from 5.7% in 2016 to 59.5% in 2021 with the introduction of many EV models by major manufacturers in the late 2010s. Tesla Motors opened a service and sales center in Iceland in September 2019 which accelerated BEV registrations in Iceland; the Tesla Model 3 became the best selling vehicle in Iceland for 2020, with 858 sold. The Nissan Leaf is the most sold fully electric vehicle in Iceland, with over 3,000 vehicles registered since 2010.
