# Exolum



The **Exolum Group** is a Spanish multinational company offering services for the transportation and storage of oil products. The **Exolum Group** is made up of **Exolum Corporation, S.A.**, **Exolum Aviación, S.A.**, **Terminales Químicos, S.A.** (**Terquimsa**), **CLH Pipeline System Ltd** (**CLH-PS**) in the United Kingdom, **CLH Aviation Ireland** in Ireland, **CLH Panamá** and **CLH Aviación Ecuador**. The company was formed from what used to be CAMPSA (Compañía Arrendataria del Monopolio de Petróleos). CLH is the result of the 1992 spin-off of the commercial assets of the former CAMPSA, which was carried out as the culmination of the process of deregulating the oil sector following the passing of new European Community laws that ended the oil monopoly. The Exolum Group's main activity consists of transporting oil products – essentially gasoline, diesel, fuel oils, and aviation fuels – from oil refineries to the storage facilities that the company has in Spain, The Netherlands, and The UK where its customers' tank trucks load these products and deliver them to the final consumers.

The International Energy Agency has given recognition to the flexibility and capacity this integrated storage and transportation system has for responding to unforeseen events. The company also provides services related to consultancy and advice for international companies in the oil or logistics sectors, gaining its first experiences in countries such as Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. Another service that Exolum is fostering is strategic storage for European Union countries.

Exolum Aviation (formerly CLH Aviación), created in 1997, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Exolum, and operates at most of the Spanish airports and some locations in Europe such as Ireland. They offer services for the storage, distribution, and into-plane supply of aviation fuels and lubricants. Exolum Aviation also provides advice and technical assistance for the installation and maintenance of distribution networks for different types of aviation fuel.

The company has received recognition from external bodies, including the rating from SAM (Sustainable Asset Management) for sustainability in its sector, the European Seal of Excellence 500+, various quality certificates from AENOR, and the Family-Responsible Company (EFR) seal of approval.

### CLH Aviation Ireland

CLH Aviation Ireland is wholly owned by CLH Aviación and manages the fuel storage terminal at Dublin Airport, where it provides logistics services for the receipt, storage and dispatch of Jet A1. The company manages the aviation fuel infrastructure at Dublin Airport under an open-access (non-discriminatory) system for all oil suppliers that operate at this airport and the different into-plane agents. In addition, CLH Aviation Ireland is currently undertaking a major renovation project at the terminal, including the expansion of its plant capacity and the construction of a new hydrant system. The new facility will include three storage tanks of 5,000 cubic meters each, office and service buildings, parking areas, pumping stations, loading systems for into-plane units, in addition to advanced safety systems. The project also involves the construction of a hydrant system at the airport boarding piers to facilitate into-plane operations, which will be connected to the storage terminal, thus allowing for improved into-plane operations.

CLH has a 40% shareholding in a joint venture entered into with the Omani company ORPIC (owner of the 60% share) under the name of Orpic Logistics Company (OLC), which is responsible for the construction and management of a storage facility near Muscat, the capital of Oman, and a network of multiproduct pipelines linking the new storage facility with two existing refineries in the country and the international airport in Muscat. In 2022, OQ Group repurchased Exolum's stake in OLC.
