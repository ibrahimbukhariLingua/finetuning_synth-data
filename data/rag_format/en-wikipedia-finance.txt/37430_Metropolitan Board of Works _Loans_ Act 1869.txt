## Legacy

Courtenay Ilbert described the act as a Consolidation Act, given that the act, which amended the borrowing powers of the Metropolitan Board of Works, also consolidated various enactments relating to that particular branch of law.

The act was wholly repealed by the London County Council (Finance Consolidation) Act 1912 (2 & 3 Geo. 5. c. cv), which consolidated and repealed the Metropolitan Board of Works Loans Acts 1869 to 1871 and the London County Council (Money) Acts 1875 to 1912.
