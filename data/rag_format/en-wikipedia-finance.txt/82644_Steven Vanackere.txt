# Steven Vanackere



**Steven Vanackere** (Dutch: [ˈsteːvə(ɱ) vɑnˈɑkərə]; born 4 February 1964) is a Belgian politician from Flanders and member of the Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V). He held the portfolios of Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Institutional Reform in the Leterme II government.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ He is the son of Leo Vanackere, who, following a political career as a Member of the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate of Belgium, became the Provincial Governor of West Flanders in 1979. His grandfather, Remi Wallays, had also been a senator and had been a former Mayor of Wevelgem.

On 7 January 2014, CD&V designated Steven Vanackere as its third-placed candidate, behind serving MEPs Marianne Thyssen and Ivo Belet, on its list for the European Parliament elections in May 2014. It had been considered unlikely by commentators that he would accept this challenge as initially when it was offered to him in December 2013, he had indicated his disappointment and seemed set to reject it, saying this would probably mark the end of his political career, given the perceived upward struggle facing CD&V in retaining its third seat in the new post-2014-election configuration of the European Parliament, both in view of the fact that Belgium's Flemish parties will have one fewer seat in the new Parliament and the increase in popularity of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) since the previous European Parliament elections. In the end, he received 151,000 votes to his name but missed out on a European parliamentary seat and subsequently mentioned on Actua-TV that he would be happy to be coopted as a senator or as a member of the new Flemish government. He ultimately took the former route, swearing the oath as a senator on 10 July 2014. Steven Vanackere lives in Neder-Over-Heembeek Brussels).

Steven Vanackere received his secondary education at the Sint-Albertuscollege in Haasrode, run by the Carmelite Friars, where he studied Latin-Mathematics.

In 1991, he was appointed Deputy Head of Staff to Jos Chabert, Minister of the Brussels-Capital Region, before becoming the Minister's Head of Staff, a post he held from 1995 to 1999. He served as Director-General of the Port of Brussels from 1993 until 2000 and as Deputy Director-General of the MIVB, the Brussels Public Transport Company, from 2000 to 2005.

In 2005, Steven Vanackere and Cathy Berx, then Members of the Flemish parliament, co-authored the book “Vergrijzing en Verkleuring [Aging and Changing Racial Mix]” by former Minister-President of Flanders, Yves Leterme (Editor-in-chief Mark Van de Voorde), published by the Davidsfonds in 2005, to which he contributed on the issue of ‘aging’.

He formed part of the CD&V's Political Executive and, together with former Members of the Chamber of Representatives, Herman Van Rompuy and Greta D’hondt, and with Koen Van den Heuvel, Member of the Flemish Parliament, he wrote the CD&V's “Sociaal-Economisch Alternatief [Socio-Economic Alternative]” as a counterpoise to the “Generatiepact [Generation Pact]” of the federal purple government – Verhofstadt II (coalition of Socialist and Liberal parties).
