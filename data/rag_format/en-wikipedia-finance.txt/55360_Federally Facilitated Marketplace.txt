Federally Facilitated Marketplace


# Federally Facilitated Marketplace



The **Federally Facilitated Marketplace** (FFM) is an organized marketplace for health insurance plans operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The FFM opened for enrollments starting October 1, 2013. The Federally Facilitated Marketplace is established in a state by the HHS Secretary for states that chose not to set up their own marketplace or did not get approval for one.

Individuals (i.e. citizens of a state) and employers will have the ability to find and purchase Qualified Health Plans through the FFM and its partners. Individuals will be able to qualify for and receive Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTC) which can be used to subsidize their premium obligations. Individuals can also qualify for Cost Sharing Reductions (CSRs) which would reduce their out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare.


## Participating states

Twenty-two states opted to participate in the FFM. Three states opted to partner with the FFM. Nineteen states opted to set up their State-Based Marketplace (SBM).
