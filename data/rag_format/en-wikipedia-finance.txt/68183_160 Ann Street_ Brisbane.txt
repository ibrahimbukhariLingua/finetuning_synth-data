## History

Since its construction in 1972, 160 Ann Street, Brisbane has had various owners.

In November 1995, Zurich Australia, part of the Zurich Insurance Group, bought it for $41.75 million. In 2005 it sold the building to Precision Group who, in 2006, transferred it to the Investa Property Group as part of a property swap. Its present owners, CorVal Partners, acquired the building in 2012.

In 2009 a study of the building was carried out as part of a Solar Hearting & Cooling Programme of the International Energy Agency. It was funded by the Australian Research Council and "considered as a 'Critical Case' representing common physical and operational characteristics of typical high rise office buildings in Australia".

In 2011 Central Queensland University commenced its Brisbane campus in the building.
