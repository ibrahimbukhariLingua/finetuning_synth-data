## History

**Banca Popolare Pugliese S.C.p.A.** was found on 2 June 1994 by the merger of Banca Popolare Sud Puglia (based in Matino) and Banca Popolare di Lecce (ex-Banca Popolare di Parabita e Aradeo). At the time BP Sud Puglia had a market share (in terms of deposits) of 2.8% in Apulia (especially 15.6% in Lecce and 5.6% in Brindisi), while BP Lecce had 1.6% in Apulia (especially 8.4% in Lecce and 3.3% in Brindisi). Their competitors Banco di Napoli and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro had 14% and 8% in Apulia respectively (data excluding the province of Foggia, as it was intended to compare to the geographical area of Banca Popolare Pugliese's network).

In 2007 the bank acquired 15 branches from Banca Carime, a subsidiary of UBI Banca.

In 2015 BPP acquired 97.37% stake in Banca del Lavoro e del Piccolo Risparmio di Benevento, which operates in 7 different locations in 6 comuni (two in Benevento).
