## Books


### *Dead Aid*

Moyo's first book, *Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There is Another Way for Africa* (2009), became a *New York Times* bestseller. It argues that government-to-government foreign aid has harmed Africa and should be phased out. In the book she states that in the past 50 years, more than $1 trillion in development-related aid has been transferred from rich countries to Africa, and questions whether anything has changed.

The book suggests that official development assistance (ODA), as opposed to humanitarian aid, perpetuates the cycle of poverty and hinders economic growth in Africa. It offers developing countries proposals for financial development instead of relying on foreign government-to-government aid.

The *Financial Times* summarized the book's argument, stating "Limitless development assistance to African governments, [Moyo] argues, has fostered dependency, encouraged corruption and ultimately perpetuated poor governance and poverty."


### *How the West Was Lost*

Moyo's second book, *How the West Was Lost: Fifty Years of Economic Folly – And the Stark Choices that Lie Ahead* (2011), became a *New York Times* bestseller, debuting at No. 6.

In a review in *The Observer*, Paul Collier wrote that "her diagnosis of the recent disasters in financial markets is succinct and sophisticated". *The Guardian* stated, "*How the West Was Lost* is more interesting, wider in scale and more important than *Dead Aid*." It went on to state, "Moyo is a very orthodox thinker, unable to consider a world beyond free markets and underpriced resources and blind to the social effects of what she proposes and celebrates"."

Similarly, Alan Beattie of the *Financial Times* wrote, "The challenges it identifies are for the most part real, if not original. But the huge flaws of the emerging economies are ignored." *The Economist* said "these arguments need much better supporting material than the book provides".


### *Winner Take All*

Moyo's third book, *Winner Take All: China's Race for Resources and What It Means for the World* (2012), examines global commodity dynamics over the next several decades, specifically China's massive global rush for natural resources including hard commodities (metals and minerals) and soft commodities (timber and food). It predicts the financial and geopolitical implications of a world of diminishing resources, and argues that China is already well on the way to gaining the upper hand in world economic dominance.

*Winner Take All* became a *New York Times* bestseller. A review in the *Financial Times* stated that "If Dambisa Moyo is right, the demands of the world's most populous state are bad news for the rest of us. ... One cannot accuse Moyo of failing to do her homework." *The Telegraph* commented "Moyo thinks [China's impact on the global commodity market] will go on and on, powered by an unstoppable Chinese economy. Perhaps she is right, but the grounds for doubting whether the future will be a straight line from the past deserve a hearing."


### *Edge of Chaos: Why Democracy Is Failing to Deliver Economic Growth – and How to Fix It*

In *Edge of Chaos*, the author crafts a compelling argument that "the global failure to achieve sustained, inclusive growth underpins the rampant political turmoil" increasingly prevalent in the 21st century. Moyo identifies improvements to worker efficiency as key to economic growth, and discusses the need to overhaul democratic capitalism, with potential solutions. The book outlines a 10-point "Blueprint for a New Democracy", designed to encourage the growth of capitalism.


### *How Boards Work: And How They Can Work Better in a Chaotic World*

Moyo's fifth book, *How Boards Work: And How They Can Work Better in a Chaotic World* was released in 2021. It provides an insider's perspective of corporate boards, reassesses the three-part board mandate, and calls for more transparent, knowledgeable, and diverse boards to steer companies through 21st-century challenges. The *Financial Times* stated that the book would be "highly instructive for aspiring non-executives" and provided "thoughtful analysis and reform proposals against which boardroom sophisticates can usefully test their assumptions".


## Personal life

In December 2020 Moyo married billionaire Jared Smith, co-founder of Utah-based cloud computing company Qualtrics.
