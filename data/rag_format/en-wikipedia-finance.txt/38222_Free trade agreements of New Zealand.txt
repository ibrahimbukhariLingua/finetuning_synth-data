Free trade agreements of New Zealand


# Free trade agreements of New Zealand



New Zealand is party to 14 free trade agreements (FTAs) worldwide. Together they accounted for over 70% of New Zealand's trade in 2023.


## History

Prior to the mid-twentieth century, New Zealand's trade was dominated by the United Kingdom which provided preferential trade quotas to her former colony. As the United Kingdom attempted to join the European Economic Community in the 1960s and move away from trade with former colonies, New Zealand sought to diversify international trade. Following this, New Zealand signed its first bilateral free trade agreement in 1965 with the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (later superseded by Closer Economic Relations in 1983). When the United Kingdom eventually joined the European Economic Community in 1973, exceptions for New Zealand allowed the United Kingdom's preferential trade offerings to be phased out until the 1990s.

Economic liberalisation in the 1970s made New Zealand into a market economy dependent on international trade especially in tourism and agricultural sectors. New Zealand has since welcomed foreign investment and has been praised as one of the most business-friendly countries in the world.

Since the 1990s, New Zealand has pursued free trade agreements as part of international trade policy with a goal (as of 2024) of 90% of exports covered by FTAs by 2030. New Zealand signed bilateral free trade agreements throughout the Asia-Pacific region through the 2000s including with significant trading partners China and the ASEAN bloc. Free trade agreements have expanded in the 2010s and 2020s with New Zealand's participation in wide multilateral FTAs including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
