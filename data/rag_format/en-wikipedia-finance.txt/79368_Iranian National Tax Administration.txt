The importance and major role of this organization in managing the economic, financial and commercial affairs of Iran and prosperity of the private sector and direction of economic and commercial activities is undeniable.


## History

One of the oldest documents on taxation is the contents of Sumerian inscriptions. In history of Manouchehr Pishdadi kingdom period, there are references to collecting taxes for the expenses of the troops. Kay KawƒÅd, king of Kayanian dynasty, was the first king that collect taxes legally and in a certain amount (10% of income). Although the exact amount of taxes collected during the Medes period is not known, it is certain that the extinction of the Medes was related to the amount of taxes collected by them.

With the formation of the Achaemenid Empire and the expansion of Iran's geographical borders from Egypt to India, regular offices and organizations were formed to receive the country's taxes and finances. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, pointed out that Darius I had divided Iran into twenty tax districts and, along with each governor, sent a tax officer to each Satrap. At the same time, all agricultural properties in the country were audited and court offices were set up to register taxes. Each mayor's share was set for local expenses, and more importantly, taxpayers had the right to object to the amount of tax received. The cash tax collected by the central government at this time was reported to be 12,480 Babylonian Talent (measurement) (about $ 24 million today). This amount was in addition to the share of local satrapies as well as stuffs taxes. The total gold reserves of the two cities of Sush and Persepolis in Alexander's invasion of Iran are estimated at one billion and eight hundred million gold francs.

During the Parthian Empire period, the regular Achaemenid system for collecting taxes was abolished and taxes were collected on a lump sum basis from each province. One of the developments of this period was the establishment of customs and the collection of customs taxes on borders.

During the Sasanian Empire era, taxation became more complete and three types of taxes were received: land, census and per capita. After the Arab invasion of Iran, during the time of governor Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, formal language in tax offices were changed from Persian to Arabic. Formal language of these offices were changed to Persian again in the Seljuq dynasty period by the order of Amid al-Mulk Kunduri, Minister of Tughril. During the Safavid dynasty, foreign trade and customs revenue were added to taxes and expanded further during the Afsharid dynasty period. During the Qajar period, the country's fiscal situation stagnated due to wars, travel, and the weakness of kings. During the reign of chief minister Amir Kabir, the Ministry of Finance was established and under his supervision, useful steps were taken to improve the country's economic situation, and new regulations were enacted for the receipt, storage and consumption of wealth in the treasury. Prior to the Constitutionalism in Iran and the absence of parliament, the King of the time had all the incomes and revenues of the country at his disposal, and all expenditures were made by his own decree and approval. The Shah usually appointed a person called the "Minister of Finance" to regulate the country's budget. The Minister of Finance was usually called "Mustowfi al-Mamalik" (means *Responsible for the finances of the whole country*). The Ministry of Finance had an internal section as the Executive Ministry's Office, which consisted of state ministers and state officials. These officials had a number of employees who were called "Mirza Qalamdan" (means *Note taker person*). Also Minister of Tax debts was in charge of collecting and calculating the debts of all provinces, and Minister of Treasury had role of Central Bank.

With the victory of the Persian Constitutional Revolution in August 1906, the first legal cabinet was formed and Abolqasem Naser ol-Molk, as the first Minister of Finance, received a positive vote of confidence from the National Consultative Assembly. So, he continued to work in the same manner as before, and by his order, the current building of Radio Tehran, which was the location of Customs Office, was assigned to the Ministry of Finance. In 1910, the seven departments of Ministry of Finance were approved and formed. In 1915, the Ministry of Finance was divided into nine departments. Theses nine departments at that time were include Ministry Department, Revenue and Net and Coin Recognition Office, General Treasury, Customs, Office of General Accounting for Taxes and Public Debts and Duties, Tax Trials, Remittance Enforcement Commission, Personnel and Supplies, and the Supreme Advisory Council for Administrative Trials. After some time, the Ministry of Finance's location was transferred to Atabek Park, the current location of the Embassy of Russia in Tehran.

With the beginning of Reza Shah's reign from the 1920s onwards, and with the arrival of American economic advisers such as William Morgan Shuster and Arthur Millspaugh, many changes took place in the management of the country's tax affairs, including the organization being divided into financial and economic parts with two deputies and seven directors. Arthur Millspaugh believed that Iranians should become accustomed to taxation and Iran's complex bureaucracy; from bribery, partisanship and advice (influence) to laziness of employees, disregard for clients, carelessness and delay work of today to tomorrow and the wrong government employment system, all should eliminated to solve this Iran's anarchy situation; and to solve this problem, which has been rooted since the Mongol government, an administrative revolution is needed, and this revolution is to pay attention to the tax system in Iran.

In 1950, the Ministry of Finance was approved with the reduction of departments and its new building was put into operation in 1959 in its current location. Finally, in 1974, law of establishing the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance was approved by the National Consultative Assembly with 6 articles. For a long time, the tax duties were the responsibility of this organization.

In 2002, in order to increase the efficiency of the tax system and eliminate existing organizational barriers and also focus all matters related to taxation in a single organization, the National Tax Administration in form of a government agency was created under the supervision of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance.
