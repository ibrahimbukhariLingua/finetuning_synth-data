Pathward


# Pathward



**Pathward Financial, Inc.** (formerly known as **MetaBank**) is a U.S.-based banking and financial services company. It adopted its current name in 2022 after its parent, Meta Financial Group, sold the "Meta" trademark to Meta Platforms.

The bank operates in several segments within the banking and payments industry: banking as a service, commercial finance and tax services.


## History


### Founding

Pathward was founded as Storm Lake Savings and Loan Association in 1954 by Stanley H. Haahr, who remained on the Board of Directors until 1990 and served as board chairman from 1981 to 1990. The bank purchased the Bradford Hotel property in Storm Lake at Fifth and Erie in 1970, and construction was completed on the bank's new headquarters in 1972. By 1993, the bank changed its name from First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Storm Lake to First Federal Savings Bank of the Midwest, a subsidiary of First Midwest Financial, Inc. On September 20, 1993, 1.9 million shares of stock in First Midwest Financial, Inc., were issued at $10 per share and began trading on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol “CASH.”


### Acquisitions

In 1994, Brookings Federal Bank, a federal savings bank in Brookings, South Dakota, was acquired and operated as the Brookings Federal Bank Division of First Federal Savings Bank of the Midwest. In 1996, Iowa Savings Bank in Des Moines was purchased and operated as the Iowa Savings Bank Division of First Federal Savings Bank of the Midwest.

In January 2018, Pathward acquired Crestmark Bank.

In March 2020, Pathward announced the sale of its community bank division to Central Bank, a state-chartered bank headquartered in Storm Lake, Iowa.


### Expansion

First Federal opened the doors to its first Sioux Falls office – a temporary facility – on September 6, 2000. In 2004, the Meta Payment Systems (MPS) division was established in Sioux Falls. The next year, in 2005, all bank divisions under First Federal changed their names to MetaBank, inhabiting four market areas: Central Iowa; Northwest Iowa; Brookings; and Sioux Falls.
In 2009, MetaBank introduced a new retail product line and the MPS division became a leading issuer of rebate and gift cards in the United States and worldwide and one of the top issuers of Visa, MasterCard and Discover prepaid cards.

They are headquartered in Easton, Pennsylvania SCS provides consumer tax advance services through its underwriting and loan management system. SCS is based in Hurst, Texas.

Pathward issued debit cards of up to $600 sent to millions of Americans as part of the second round of COVID-19 Economic Impact Payments in January 2021. MetaBank acted as the U.S. Treasury's "financial agent" for this purpose.


### Illegal Activities and Fines

Pathward Bank has agreed to pay about $700,000 in refunds and penalties stemming from an investigation conducted by the New York Attorney General's Office that revealed the bank unlawfully froze customer accounts and illegally transferred money to debt collectors.

Pathward cooperated with the investigation and voluntarily began remedying its practices last year, according to a Wednesday release from NY AG Letitia James's office. “We are updating our procedures and are confident that similar issues will not occur going forward,” a Pathward spokesperson said in an email. “We empathize with customers adversely affected and will work hard to regain their trust.”

The bank will refund $79,664 plus interest to about 88 New Yorkers who had funds turned over to debt collectors. Pathward is also ordered to pay a penalty of $627,000 for its “illegal and deceptive conduct,” according to the press release.
