Under the management of C.P. Zochonis, PZ invested in its host countries by opening factories and shops there. In 1948 PZ took over a Nigerian soap manufacturer. "This proved to be a landmark in the company's history, as soap was to become a major part of its trade". However, under the management of C.P. Zochonis, the company allowed colonial attitudes to affect local African peoples.
