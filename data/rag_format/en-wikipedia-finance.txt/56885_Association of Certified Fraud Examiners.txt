Based in Austin, Texas, the ACFE was founded in 1988 by Joseph T. Wells. The ACFE grants the professional designation of Certified Fraud Examiner (abbreviated CFE).


## Founder

In addition to his duties as chairman, Wells writes, researches and lectures to business and professional groups on white-collar crime issues. He has written books and articles on fraud prevention and detection. His writings appear in professional journals.

The ACFE runs a fraud museum containing exhibits linked to famous frauds, which is open to the public. *America's Guide to Fraud Prevention*, written by the famous confidence trickster Steve Comisar, is on display in the ACFE fraud museum. The book is considered a piece of fraud history.


## Reports and statistics

According to a 2014 report, companies lose 5% annually due to fraud, and most often this happens in the accounting department. In a 2018 report, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners stated that up to 28% of small businesses have been involved in some form of fraud, with the figure ranging from 22% to 26% for larger companies. As a result of research conducted by the ACFE in 2022, it was found that professional fraud leads to losses in excess of $3.6 billion annually, especially as a result of misappropriation of assets.
