# Tate baronets



The **Tate Baronetcy**, of Park Hill in Streatham in the County of London, is a title in the baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 27 June 1898 for the sugar magnate and philanthropist Henry Tate. He gave Tate Gallery to the nation. The second baronet was high sheriff of Lancashire in 1907. The fourth baronet served as high sheriff of Rutland from 1949 to 1950. The fifth baronet served as managing director of the family company, Tate & Lyle, and was later chairman of the London Futures & Options Exchange. Sir Henry Tate 1st Baronet was initially offered a Barony for his philanthropy, he rejected this twice until the then prime minister Robert Gascoyne-Cecil 3rd Marquess of Salisbury said it would be an insult to the Monarch, Queen Victoria if he did not take at least a Baronetage.

As of 2014, the title is held by the latter's son, the sixth baronet, who succeeded in 2012. As of 28 February 2014, the present baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered 'vacant' he though does serve as Deputy Lieutenant of Shropshire.
