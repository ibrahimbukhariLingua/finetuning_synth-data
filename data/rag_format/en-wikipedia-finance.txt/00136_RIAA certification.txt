RIAA certification


# RIAA certification



In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) operates an awards program based on the certified number of albums and singles sold through retail and other ancillary markets. Other countries have similar awards (see music recording certification). Certification is not automatic; for an award to be made, the record label must first request certification. The audit is conducted against net shipments after returns (most often an artist's royalty statement is used), which includes albums sold directly to retailers and one-stops, direct-to-consumer sales (music clubs and mail order) and other outlets.


## Audit of RIAA certifications

The association is popularly known for its traditional gold and platinum certification of albums and songs in the United States and also participates in collective recording rights management. The private company **Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman (GR&F)** is responsible for auditing RIAA sales. According to the Recording Industry Association of America's official website, "All certification audits are conducted, for a fee, by Gelfand, Rennert and Feldman, LLP (GR&F) for the RIAA. If multiple certification levels are certified simultaneously, only an audit certification fee will be charged." The RIAA website also mentions privately held Rennert and Feldman, LLP (GR&F) as RIAA auditors in all certification correspondence.


## Description and qualifications

A Gold record is a song or album that sells 500,000 units (records, tapes, and compact discs). The award was launched in 1958; originally, the requirement for a Gold single was one million units sold and a Gold album represented $1 million in sales (at wholesale value, around a third of the list price). In 1975, the additional requirement of 500,000 units sold was added for Gold albums. Reflecting growth in record sales, the Platinum award was added in 1976, for albums that sold one million units and for singles selling two million units. The Multi-Platinum award was introduced in 1984, signifying multiple Platinum levels of albums and singles. In 1989, the sales thresholds for singles were reduced to 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum, reflecting a decrease in sales of singles. In 1992, RIAA began counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification. Reflecting additional growth in music sales, the Diamond award was instituted in 1999 for albums or singles selling ten million units. Because of these changes in criteria, the sales level associated with a particular award depends on when the award was made.

Nielsen SoundScan figures are not used in RIAA certification; the RIAA system predates Nielsen SoundScan and includes sales outlets Nielsen misses.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, RIAA certification was the only audited and verifiable system for tracking music sales in the U.S.; it is still the only system capable of tracking 100% of sales (albeit as shipments less returns, not actual sales like Nielsen SoundScan).ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ This system has permitted, at times, record labels to promote an album as Gold or Platinum simply based on large shipments. For instance, in 1978 the *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* soundtrack shipped Platinum but was a sales bust, with two million returns. Similarly, all four solo albums by the members of Kiss simultaneously shipped Platinum that same year but did not reach the top 20 of the Billboard 200 album chart. The following year, the RIAA began requiring 120 days from the release date before recordings were eligible for certification, although that requirement has been reduced over the years and currently stands at 30 days. Upon criticism on why the RIAA won't adopt SoundScan as its source, Hilary Rosen, president of the recording association, defended their system: "We think the certification process represents an accurate sales picture and we’re comfortable with the numbers we release."

In the digital era, changes in the way music is consumed resulted in changes in the certification criteria. Actual album sales had dropped significantly, while digital download followed by streaming became increasingly dominant. On-demand audio and video streams started to be counted towards Digital Single units consumed in 2013. Track downloads and audio and video streams were then included in album certification in 2016 using formulas converting downloads and streams into the album units for certification purpose.


## List of certifications


### Records

* 500,000 units: Gold album
* 1,000,000 units: Platinum album
* 2,000,000+ (in increments of 1,000,000 thereafter) units: Multi-Platinum album
* 10,000,000 units: Diamond album

Starting from February 1, 2016, each album unit may be one of the following:

1. Each permanent digital album or physical album sale;
2. 10 tracks from the album downloaded;
3. 1,500 on-demand audio or video streams of songs from the album.

#### Multi-disc

Multi-disc albums are counted once for each disc within the album if it is over 100 minutes in length or is from the vinyl era. For example, the Smashing Pumpkins' *Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness* (running time of 121:39) and OutKast's *Speakerboxxx/The Love Below* (running time of 134:56), both double albums, were counted twice, meaning each album was certified diamond after 5 million copies were shipped. Pink Floyd's *The Wall* and the Beatles' *White Album*, both vinyl-era, are also counted as double even though their running times are under the minimum requirement. Rules may or may not apply depending on most recent staff within the Distributions position.


#### Latin

Since 2000, the RIAA also awards *Los Premios de Oro y de Platino* (Gold and Platinum Awards in Spanish) to Latin albums, which are defined by the RIAA as a type of product that features at least 51% of content in Spanish.

List of certifications, showing name and units required
| Certification | Units required (as of December 20, 2013) | Units required (before December 20, 2013) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Disco de Oro* | 30,000 | 50,000 |
| *Disco de Platino* | 60,000 | 100,000 |
| *Disco de Multi-Platino* | 120,000 | 200,000 |
| *Disco de Diamante* | 600,000 | 1,000,000 |

**Note:** The number of sales required to qualify for Oro and Platino awards was higher prior to January 1, 2008. The thresholds were 100,000 units (Oro) and 200,000 units (Platino). All Spanish-language albums certified prior to 2008 were updated to match the current certification at the time. "La Bomba" by Bolivian group Azul Azul is the only single to receive a Latin certification based on shipments before the creation of the Latin digital singles awards in 2013. The *Disco de Diamante* award was introduced after the RIAA updated the thresholds for Latin certifications on December 20, 2013. The *Disco de Diamante* is awarded to Latin albums that have been certified 10× Platinum.


### Singles

Standard singles are certified:

* Gold when it ships 500,000 copies
* Platinum when it ships 1,000,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum when it ships at least 2,000,000 copies

Note: The number of sales required to qualify for Gold and Platinum discs was higher prior to January 1, 1989. The thresholds were previously 1,000,000 units (Gold) and 2,000,000 units (Platinum).

Digital singles are certified:

* Gold means 500,000 certification units
* Platinum means 1,000,000 certification units
* Multi-Platinum means 2,000,000+ certification units

From 2004 through July 2006, the certification level was 100,000 downloads for Gold and 200,000 for Platinum. When the RIAA changed the certification standards to match retail distribution in August 2006, all Platinum and Multi-Platinum awards for a digital release were withdrawn. Gold certifications, however, were not, meaning a song that was downloaded over 100,000 times and certified so by the RIAA during that time frame retains its Gold status.

Starting May 9, 2013, RIAA certifications for singles in the "digital" category include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads at a rate of 100 streams = 1 certification "unit". On February 1, 2016, this rate was updated to 150 streams = 1 certification unit.

Latin digital singles are certified:

* Disco de Oro (Gold) means 30,000 certification units
* Disco de Platino (Platinum) means 60,000 certification units
* Disco de Multi-Platino (Multi-Platinum) means 120,000+ certification units

The Latin Digital Single Awards began on December 20, 2013. As with the digital sales, 100 streams count as one download sale.


### Video Longform

Along with albums, digital albums, and singles there is another classification of music release called "Video Longform." This release format includes DVD and VHS releases, and certain live albums and compilation albums. The certification criteria are slightly different from other styles.

* Gold: 50,000 copies
* Platinum: 100,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 200,000 copies

### Video Single

For Video Single certification, the title must contain no more than two songs and must have a running time of no more than 15 minutes. The certification criteria are:

* Gold: 25,000 copies
* Platinum: 50,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 100,000 copies

As of 2021ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the titles certified the most Video Single awards are "Here Without You" by 3 Doors Down and Elvis Presley's "A Little Less Conversation", both winning 6× Platinum for 300,000 copies. Since 2010, only 5 titles have been certified Video Single. The latest Gold was awarded to "R40" by Rush in 2017.


### Video Box Set

The Video Box Set (or Multi-Box Music Video Set) award is a classification for video compilations that include three or more videos that are grouped and marketed together as a set. Like Video Longform, this includes DVD and VHS releases and the certification criteria are the same. Each individual video within set is counted as one toward certification.

* Gold: 50,000 copies
* Platinum: 100,000 copies
* Multi-Platinum: 200,000 copies

The best-selling video box set as certified by the RIAA is the Rolling Stones' *Four Flicks* DVD compilation from their Licks World Tour, with a 19× Multi-Platinum designation. This was likely achieved due to exclusive distribution rights owned by retailer Best Buy by their short-lived music production company, Redline Entertainment.


### Master Ringtone

Master Ringtone (mastertone) awards were introduced in 2006. Certification levels are identical to those of singles, 500,000 for Gold and 1,000,000 for Platinum and 2,000,000+ Multi-Platinum.

Many Master Ringtone certifications were awarded until 2009, but since then only ten certifications were awarded in 2010, three in 2012 and three in 2019, all three to AC/DC.
