Parques Reunidos


# Parques Reunidos



**Parques Reunidos** (meaning "Reunited Parks") is an international entertainment operator based in Madrid, Spain. The group operates over 60 parks in about dozen countries. Parques Reunidos operates theme and amusement parks, zoos, water parks, family entertainment centers, and cable cars. These facilities are located in Spain, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Australia and the United States. Through acquisitions of established names such as Kennywood Entertainment Company, Dutch Wonderland and Palace Entertainment, Parques Reunidos greatly expanded its presence in American amusement operations beginning in 2007 through today. Annual visitors to the group's attractions exceed 22 million, with revenue exceeding $570 million (USD). In 2008 it had the fifth-highest attendance figures for worldwide chains with 24.9 million, ahead of United Parks & Resorts and Cedar Fair.


## Palace Entertainment

**Palace Entertainment** is a subsidiary of Parques Reunidos based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and is primarily involved in the operation of attractions in the United States.

Palace Entertainment was established in 1998, after the acquisition of four independently owned family entertainment companies. These four companies consisted of five brands: Camelot Parks, Palace Park, Boomers!, Grand Prix Race-O-Rama and Family Fun Center. In the early 2000s the company purchased various Water Parks and Family Entertainment Centers.

On February 27, 2006, it was announced that MidOcean Partners was to acquire Palace Entertainment. This transaction occurred in the second quarter 2006.

On August 24, 2007, MidOcean Partners sold Palace Entertainment to Parques Reunidos for $330 Million. This transaction took place in the third quarter of 2007.

Fernando Eiroa joined Palace Entertainment in 2007, serving as president and chief executive officer.

On December 11, 2007 Kennywood Entertainment Company entered an agreement to sell their Five Properties (Kennywood, Idlewild and Soak Zone, Sandcastle Waterpark, Lake Compounce and Story Land) to Palace Entertainment's parent company Parques Reunidos. By 2009 Palace had taken over operations of all five parks.

On November 12, 2010, Palace Entertainment announced the acquisition of Dutch Wonderland Family Amusement Park in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, from Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company.

On March 2, 2012, Palace Entertainment announced the acquisition of Noah's Ark Water Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.

In 2014, Palace Entertainment acquired Miami Seaquarium in Key Biscayne, Florida.

Later that year Palace Entertainment sold 15 properties to the newly formed Apex Parks Group Including Big Kahuna's, 10 Boomers locations as well as an additional Family 4 Entertainment Centers. This was in an effort to move away from Family Entertainment Center operations for Palace Entertainment.

In March 2020, it was announced that Palace Entertainment would open a new corporate facility near the Kennywood property. This new facility will house 25 executives as well as their East Coast team.

In December 2021, Palace Entertainment would acquire Adventureland in Altoona, Iowa.
