## History

IK Partners was established in 1989. Founded under the name Industri Kapital by Björn Savén and Kim Wahl, the partnership's origins lie in Enskilda Ventures, which in 1989 sponsored Björn Savén in raising the Scandinavian Acquisition Capital Fund (SAC) and established the London office. SAC closed with approximately €108 million in commitments, mainly from Scandinavian investors.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

In 1993 Industri Kapital became independent through the management buyout of SAC's assets and activities from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the parent of Enskilda Ventures. SAC's was renamed the Industri Kapital 1989 fund. In the same year, the company established offices in Stockholm and Oslo.

After having its name changed to IK Investment Partners in June 2008, it became known as IK Partners in September 2021. In December 2023, it disposed of CDMO Klingel Holding to Swedish medical devices developer and manufacturer Elos Medtech for a sum of €370m.
