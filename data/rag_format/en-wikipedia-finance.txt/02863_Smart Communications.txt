## History

Anticipating the liberalization of the telecommunications industry in the Philippines a group of Filipino investors led by Orlando B. Vea and David T. Fernando organized Smart (then named Smart Information Technology, Inc.) on January 24, 1991. The company obtained its congressional franchise in April 1992 and was granted a provisional authority to operate a mobile cellular service in May 1993. In December 1993, Smart commenced commercial operations of its cellular service. By then, Smart had drawn in partners. These were: First Pacific, a Hong Kong–based conglomerate through its Philippine flagship Metro Pacific Investments Corporation and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan (NTT).

In compliance with the government's telecommunications program, Smart established a local exchange service in the cities and provinces assigned to it under the "service area scheme." The company also obtained licenses to provide international gateway, paging and inter-carrier transmission services.

On March 24, 2000, PLDT completed its share-swap acquisition of Smart, making Smart a 100%-owned PLDT subsidiary. In 2003, Smart was named the best employer in the Philippines in a study conducted by the firm Hewitt Associates.

In February 2011, Smart unveiled the Netphone, its own line of Android-compliant smartphones designed for emerging markets at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The Netphone was introduced as the world's first smartphone backed by an operator-managed platform.

On August 25, 2012, Smart launched the Philippines' first 4G mobile broadband commercial service running on LTE technology. On April 13, 2016, Smart introduced the first commercial LTE-A Service in Boracay, Aklan.

On June 13, 2016, Smart and its parent company PLDT unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.

In February 2017, Smart and parent company PLDT signed a memorandum of understanding with China-based Huawei Technologies "to shape the strategic and commercial development of the 5G ecosystem in the Philippines".

On April 21, 2017, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 10926 which renewed Smart's license for another 25 years. The law granted Smart a franchise to establish, maintain, lease and operate integrated telecommunications, computers, electronics, and stations throughout the Philippines.

In October 2018, petitioners asked the Supreme Court to stop Globe and Smart from using the 700 MHz and Smart announced that they were working to fix its slow internet service. On July 30, 2020, Smart activated their 5G mobile network initially in Makati Central Business District, Bonifacio Global City, Araneta City, SM Megamall and SM Mall of Asia Bay Area.

In Opensignal's April report, on internet speed contest, Dito Telecommunity outplaced Smart Communications and Globe Telecom in the first quarter, with a download speed of 32 Mbps. It is also now the fastest operator for 5G, averaging 302.9 Mbps as against Smart’s 143.3 Mbps. In the reliability experience of subscribers, it further scored 835 out of 1,000 to breaking Smart’s 771 and Globe’s 748.

The company has more than 66 million mobile subscribers as of 2022, under the brands Smart, Sun, and TNT, in addition to wireless broadband subscribers number more than 3.9 million under the brands Smart Bro and Sun Wireless Broadband.

By virtue of SIM Registration Act and due to the deactivation of unregistered SIM cards, Smart has 50.0 million subscribers as of July 26, 2023. Smart now becomes the network with the most subscribers, beating Globe Telecom by 1.6 million subscribers.

At the end of the 5-day grace period, Smart registered 52,500,870 subscribers which came into second to Globe Telecom as of July 30, 2023. Out of its total 66,304761 subscribers or 79.18% of its total subscriber base, Smart loses 13,803,891 SIM cards to deactivation.

As of November 2023, Smart reported that it has 55.2 million subscribers following the implementation of SIM (subscriber identity module) card registration, which is slightly more than 54.7 million of close competitor Globe Telecom Inc., regaining its place as the mobile network with the largest subscriber base.
