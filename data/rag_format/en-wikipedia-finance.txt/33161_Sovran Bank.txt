Sovran Bank


# Sovran Bank



**Sovran Bank** was a regional bank that operated in Virginia between 1983 and 1990. It was the primary subsidiary of **Sovran Financial Corporation**, a bank holding company. It was formed from the 1983 merger of First & Merchants Bank of and Virginia National Bankshares, both of which could trace back their history to the 1860s. In 1990, Sovran merged with Citizens & Southern National Bank to form C&S/Sovran Corp., which in 1991, merged with North Carolina National Bank to form NationsBank. That bank became Bank of America in 1998.

The name Sovran came from Glenn Monigle & Associates as a simple spelling of "sovereign".


## History


### First & Merchants Bank

Richmond had no bank after the federal government had revoked charters of banks whose loyalty was questioned. Eight days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee after the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the city's financial leaders started a new federally chartered bank. First National Bank opened for business in the Customs House. Lee was one of the new bank's early customers.

It merged with National Exchange Bank and moved to 10th and Main streets. Despite the Panic of 1893, First National Bank had the most assets of any Richmond bank by 1900.

National Bank of Virginia merged with First National on September 1, 1912.

Alfred Charles Bossom of Clinton & Russell in New York City designed the First National Bank Building, the first skyscraper in Richmond, at 9th and Main streets, completed in 1913. BB&T later occupied the building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Merchants National Bank merged with First National on February 27, 1926, at which time the bank became First & Merchants Bank.

In 1981, The National Bank of Fairfax merged with First & Merchants Bank. The first bank in Fairfax, Virginia, it was organized in 1902.

### Virginia National Bank

Norfolk National Bank was organized in 1885 and became "not only the leading bank of Norfolk, but probably the leading bank of Virginia, having recently increased its capital to one million dollars, with a surplus of half a million." Norfolk National Bank, Trust Company of Norfolk (1895) and National Bank of Commerce (1867) joined to become Norfolk National Bank of Commerce & Trusts, which joined with Virginia National Bank of Norfolk to become National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk October 9, 1933.

People's National Bank was organized in 1903 in Roanoke.

In 1920, Church Street Bank at Church and Freemason streets in Norfolk became American Exchange Bank, whose deposits were taken over in 1924 by Virginia National Bank.

In 1962, a merger with two Southampton County banks formed Tidewater Bank and Trust Co., which was then acquired by Virginia National Bank.

Virginia National Bank's 24-story Norfolk headquarters opened in January 1968.

Richmond's Virginia Trust Company could be chartered only after special legislation, since trust companies were new in the south and not all banks could have trust departments.

The Virginia Trust Company building, also designed by Bossom, opened May 31, 1921, was an example of Neoclassical architecture, using granite, marble, bronze and mahogany, with a "gilded, coffered ceiling" and "a facade patterned directly after a Roman triumphal arch."

However, it was named **C&S/Sovran**. The merged bank had dual headquarters in Atlanta and Norfolk.
