Foundation for Information Policy Research


# Foundation for Information Policy Research



The **Foundation for Information Policy Research** is a UK-based think tank that studies the interaction between information technology and government, business and civil society. It has been described by academics as "the leading think-tank on information policy issues in Britain". Although still registered at Companies House, it hasn't published anything since 2017.

Established in May 1998, the organisation is a non-profit company limited by guarantee. Its policy is governed by an independent board of trustees in consultation with an advisory council.

In 2008, FIPR argued that a planned partnership between telecom group BT and targeted advertising Phorm technology was illegal under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
