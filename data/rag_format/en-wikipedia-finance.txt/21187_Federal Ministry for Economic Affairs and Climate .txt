Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action


# Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action



The **Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action** (German: *Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz*, pronounced [ˈbʊndəsminɪsˌteːʁiʊm fyːɐ ˈvɪʁtʃaft ʊnt ˈkliːmaˌʃʊts] ), abbreviated **BMWK** (was BMWi), is a cabinet-level ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany. It was previously known as the "Ministry of Economy". It was recreated in 2005 as "Ministry of Economics and Technology" after it had previously been merged with other ministries to form the Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour between 2002 and 2005. The ministry is advised by the Council of Advisors on Digital Economy.


## History

The historical predecessor of the current Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action was the *Reichswirtschaftsamt* (Reich Economic Office), founded in 1917. In 1919, this became the *Reichswirtschaftsministerium* (Reich Ministry of Economy), which existed until 1945.

In postwar occupied Germany, its functions were exercised by the Administrative Office of Economy (German: *Verwaltungsamt für Wirtschaft*) between 1946 and 1949. After the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federal Ministry of Economics (German: *Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft*) existed from 1949 to 1998. From May 1971 to December 1972, it was temporarily merged with the Federal Ministry of Finance, in the Federal Ministry of Economics and Finance. In 1998 the technology section of the Ministry of Research was added, making it the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology.

Between 2002 and 2005, it was merged with the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology and one part of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs - the other part being merged with the old Federal Ministry for Health, then the Ministry of Health and Social Security. This transformations aimed to consolidate the policy-fields of economics and labour market, on which the second term of chancellor Gerhard Schröder wanted to focus, into one hand. Because the new Ministry was very large and important, it was often referred to as a super-ministry (*Superministerium*) and its minister as a super-minister (*Superminister*). The creation of the new Ministry was widely seen as failed, basically because of the poor performance of the only office-holder Wolfgang Clement.

Under the following grand coalition headed by Angela Merkel, the portfolio reshuffle was reversed, and the old Federal Ministries of Economics and Technology, of Labour and Social Affairs and of Health were created once again as Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology. It was renamed to Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in 2013.

* In order of the Federal Republic of Germany the Ministry has published a fact sheet on the unique dual vocational training system.
