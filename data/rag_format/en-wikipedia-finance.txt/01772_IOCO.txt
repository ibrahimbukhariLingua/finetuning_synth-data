## Controversies

EOH Group executive, Jehan Mackay, was implicated in a bribery scandal to obtain South African government contracts between 2015 and 2016. In 2020 company representatives gave testimony to the Zondo Commission on its involvement in government corruption and state capture.

In 2017, the company won a tender of almost R300 million to update the Department of Home Affairs's population register system, but as of 2022 no work had been completed. A subsequent investigation by forensic accounting firm Nexia SAB&T revealed that the company beat its competitors in a "corruption infested" bidding process.
