## Professional career


### Jefferies

Handler joined Jefferies in April 1990 as a salesman and trader. He was appointed CEO on January 1, 2001 and Chairman in 2002, succeeding Frank E. Baxter. Handler also is Chairman of Jefferies' Global Diversity Council. When Handler joined as CEO, Jefferies had been primarily known as a trading firm with expertise in the energy sector.

### Rescue of Knight Capital Group

In August 2012, Handler played a lead role in saving Knight Capital Group after the company suffered a $440 million loss due to a 'technology glitch.' Together with Brian Friedman, the President of Jefferies Financial Group, Handler structured and led the rescue, making Jefferies the largest shareholder with a roughly 45% stake in the company.


### Merger with Leucadia

In November 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia National Corporation, its largest shareholder and a longtime partner of Handler. In March 2013, Jefferies merged with Leucadia, and Handler became CEO of both companies. In 2018, Leucadia rebranded as Jefferies Financial Group Inc. to better reflect the company’s business focus.


## Other professional activities

In October 2018 Handler was named Board Chair by The University of Rochester Board of Trustees, to which he was first elected in 2005. Previously, Handler was Chairman of the Finance Committee and as Co-Chairman of the university's $1.37 billion Capital Campaign, The Meliora Challenge that concluded in 2016.

Handler is active on social media, where he often runs ‘ask me anything’ sessions on Instagram targeted at the next generation of bankers and traders.


## Philanthropy

In 2006, Handler and his wife, Martha, established a scholarship program at the University of Rochester. Named the Jane and Alan Handler Scholarship Fund (after his parents), the program provides financial support for undergraduates of diverse backgrounds who meet certain criteria of financial need, overcoming adversity and demonstrating leadership. The scholarship is awarded to one percent of each graduating class and covers all tuition and expenses.

Handler is also active in conservation efforts through the Wolf Conservation Center, of which his wife presides as president.
