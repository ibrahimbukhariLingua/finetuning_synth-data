## History

The company was formed in 1995 as a unit of American Radio Systems. In 1998, American Radio Systems merged with CBS Corporation and completed the corporate spin-off of American Tower. The first CEO of American Tower was Steven B. Dodge, remaining in the position until resigning in 2004. Following the merger, American Tower began international expansion by establishing operations in Mexico in 1998 and Brazil in 1999.

Around 2000, the company began purchasing numerous AT&T Long Lines microwave telephone relay towers. Upon acquisition of these sites from the now defunct AT&T Communications, Inc., American Tower began repurposing the towers for use as cell towers, and leasing antenna space to various American cell phone providers and private industries. Then, most of the former AT&T Long Lines sites had their horn antennas removed, either by helicopter or by crane, to make room for more antennas. Since AT&T's Long Lines Program was decommissioned in the 1980s, and the company no longer had any use for the towers themselves, American Tower now owns most of these tower structures across the entire continental United States, totaling 42,965 in 2022.

In 2004 James D. Taiclet was named CEO and held the title until 2020.

In 2005, American Tower acquired SpectraSite Communications, expanding its global portfolio to over 22,000 owned communications sites, including over 21,000 wireless towers, 400 broadcast towers and 100 in-building DAS (Distributed Antenna System) sites. The merger further established American Tower's position as one of the largest tower owners and operators in North America.

Between 2007 and 2012, the company expanded internationally with operations in India, Peru, Chile, Colombia, South Africa, Ghana, and Uganda.

In 2013, the company acquired Global Tower Partners for $4.8 billion. This acquisition added sites to the U.S. portfolio and added operations in Costa Rica and Panama.

In 2020, Tom Bartlett was named President and CEO after Taiclet left to become the CEO of Lockheed Martin.

In 2021, the company agreed to acquire the European and Latin American tower divisions of Telxius from parent company Telefonica, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites for $9.6 billion. The acquired sites were located in Spain, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. Later in 2021, American Tower acquired CoreSite for $10.4 billion, adding a footprint of carrier-neutral data center facilities in the U.S. to its holdings, to position the company to strengthen its position in 5G.

Tom Bartlett retired from his positions as President, Chief Executive Officer, and director of the Board of Directors, effective February 1, 2024. He was succeeded by Steven Vondran.
