Two-baht coin


# Two-baht coin



In Thailand, the **two-baht coin** is the coin which is worth 2 baht or 200 satang. The new 2-baht coin design features H.M. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the Great on the obverse, like all other Thai legal tender coins presently in circulation. The reverse design depicts the Golden Mountain at Wat Saket Ratcha Wora Maha Wihan in Bangkok.

Before the two-baht coin entered into circulation, this denomination was used as a commemorative coin since 1979. As of 1996, there is one cupronickel and forty cupronickel-clad-copper commemorative coin series.

On September 15, 2005, the Royal Thai Mint began minting two-baht coins to complete the binary system in Thailand's coinage. That is, each successive denomination is worth twice, or roughly twice, as much as the previous one.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Thai coin denominations in general circulation are now 25 satang, 50 satang, 1 baht, 2 baht, 5 baht, and 10 baht.

Recent statistics show that the one-baht coins constitute about 60% of the total coin circulation in the Thai economy. According to the Treasury Department, the issuance of the two-baht coins will solve the overwhelming demand for the one-baht coins as the two-baht coins now fill the gap between the one- and five-baht coins. This translates into savings in time and materials for the mint. The mint is considering expanding the use of multi-ply plated steel technology to other coin denominations due to volatile base metal prices and rising production costs.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

On February 3, 2009, the Royal Thai Mint released the new series two-baht coin, minted in 2008, which uses aluminium bronze in place of the former nickel-clad low-carbon steel.


## 2005-2007 two-baht coin

The original two-baht coin was minted 2005-2007, and was the sole two-baht coin in circulation from 2005 until February 3, 2009, when the new design was released. The old design was not removed from circulation.

The obverse was designed by Mrs Phutthachat Arunwet (Thai: พุทธชาติ อรุณเวช), and sculpted by Mr Panya Khamkhen (Thai: ปัญญา คำเคน). The reverse was designed by Mr Chaiyod Soontrapa (Thai: ไชยยศ สุนทราภา), and sculpted by Mr Thammanun Kaeosawang (Thai: ธรรมนูญ แก้วสว่าง). The same designer created the artwork of the reverse on the new two-baht coin, and the artwork is similar, but not identical.
