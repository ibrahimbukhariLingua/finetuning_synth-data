The **Harpenden Building Society** is an English building society, which has its Head Office in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. Formed on 3 March 1953, it is the 38th largest in the United Kingdom based on total assets of Â£315 million at 31 December 2017. It is a member of the Building Societies Association.

An agency office (now closed) was opened in Stopsley in Luton in 2008, in September 2010 a fourth branch opened in Wendover, with a fifth in Tring in January 2011 and sixth in Buckingham in March 2011. The Wendover and Buckingham branches were closed in 2020, explaining they were the "smallest and least utilised branches".

Its branch and agency network is therefore based in the Northern Home Counties, with branches in Radlett, Harpenden, Leighton Buzzard and Tring. Accounts are also operated via post and online banking nationwide.

The Society celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2013. In 2015, 2016, and since 2017, each year it has won the What Mortgage Award for Best Local Building Society.
