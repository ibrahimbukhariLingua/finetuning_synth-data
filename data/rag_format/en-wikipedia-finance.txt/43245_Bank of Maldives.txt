## History


### The First Years

The idea of establishing a central bank was first conceived in 1979. Discussions on a joint venture began with the Government of Bangladesh during the same year, to form a national bank with a major share of the Maldivian government. BML was officially inaugurated by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on 11 November 1982 at a ceremony held at the Bank's new headquarters.


### Expansion

The first atoll-based branch of the bank was opened in Gan, Addu Atoll in December 1983. This strategic decision made by the bank, offered the opportunity to extend its reach to the largest population centre outside Male’ with a single branch.

With the second branch opened in Naifaru in 1990, the Bank established a northern presence in the atolls. By 2016, the Bank's services expanded to have at least one branch in each atoll.

Today, BML has 38 branches and service centres across all 20 atolls, 85 Self Service Banking Centres, 141 ATMs, over 200 agents and Digital Banking services.

Following the launch of the first ATMs, the first cards and the first POS terminal, BML then launched their Internet Banking service in 2007.
