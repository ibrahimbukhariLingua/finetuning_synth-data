## Controversies

The movie *Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers* claims that Lesar has been paid over $42,000,000 by Halliburton since the beginning of the Iraq war, but this amount has risen significantly since the release of the film. According to *The Wall Street Journal* Lesar received about $14.9 million in 2010 alone, not including stock options or other deferred incentives – a 20% increase over his 2009 pay package, according to a securities filing.

In November 2014, Lesar faced criticism over his bid to take over Baker Hughes: "the smaller oil-field services rival, in an email to Mr. Lesar, described Halliburton's actions as intransigent and inappropriate".
