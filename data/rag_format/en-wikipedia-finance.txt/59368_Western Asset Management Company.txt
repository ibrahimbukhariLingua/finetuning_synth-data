### Expansion (1996-present)

In February 1996, Legg Mason acquired Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management Limited, based in London, to broaden Western Asset's non-dollar capabilities.

To further develop Western Asset's capabilities and global presence, Legg Mason acquired a substantial part of Citigroup's asset management business in exchange for its brokerage and capital markets business. As part of the transaction, Western Asset gained new offices in New York, São Paulo, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Melbourne, in addition to related staff and assets.

In July 2020, Franklin Templeton acquired Legg Mason, making Western Asset Management one of Franklin Templeton's Specialist Investment Managers.
