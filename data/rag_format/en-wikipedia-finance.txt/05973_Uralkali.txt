### Recent news

In December 2010, Uralkali announced plans to buy another Russian potash producer Silvinit; together they would form one of the world's largest potash producers. The merger was finalized in June 2011, with the combined Uralkali accounting for about 20% of the world's potash production.

On 9 November 2012, Chengdong Investment Corp., a unit of the sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, bought bonds from the shareholders with maturation in 2014 which were exchangeable into a stake in Uralkali. Chengdong would be able to convert its investment into a 12.5 percent stake in Uralkali's ordinary shares. In September 2013, the bonds were converted and CIC thus acquired a 12.5% stake in the firm, rumoured to be worth around $2 billion.

In June 2012, Green Patrol, a Russian environmental non-governmental organization, listed Uralkali as one of the top 100 polluters in Russia, based on information gathered during the previous years. An expedition organised into the Perm Krai by Green Patrol in 2010 revealed that Uralkali's sinks contained at least 16 harmful elements (including zinc and ammonium), exceeding the maximum permissible levels by 1,850 times. Furthermore, according to Green Patrol's President Roman Pukalov, Uralkali failed to fully disclose a complete list of harmful elements that it routinely rejected into the local river Kama. Roman Pukalov described Kama water as "very polluted", and declared that small rivers around Berezniki had in fact turned into brine, something he had "never seen anywhere else".

On 30 July 2013 Uralkali announced that it was pulling out of the Belarusian Potash Company export JV with Belaruskali, through which it exported potash from 2005 to July 2013, and said it would sell the fertilizer on its own. This move sent shares of potash companies tumbling on speculation that potash prices would plunge. This dispute arose over foreign sales and top executives at Uralkali were accused of a criminal scheme. On 26 August Belarus detained the company's CEO Vladislav Baumgertner after inviting him to Minsk for talks. In September 2013 he was moved from solitary confinement and put under house arrest.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ Uralkali insists that persecution of its employees by Belarusian officials is politically motivated. On 14 October Russia opened a criminal investigation into Vladislav Baumgertner as well, and investigators announced they will request his extradition from Belarus. In November 2013 Vladislav Baumgertner was extradited to Russia and later put under house arrest. In September 2014 he was released on bail.

In December 2013 Suleiman Kerimov sold his shares (21.75%) to ONEXIM Group, while Dmitry Mazepin's Uralchem acquired 19.99%, both becoming key shareholders in Uralkali.

In November 2015, Uralkali's board approved its latest share buyback program, a move that was expected to result in the delisting of the company's stock in London. Uralkali, which also trades in Moscow, said it will repurchase as much as 6.5 percent of its shares from the open market by the end of March 2016.

On 5 October 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued an order asking the General Attorney of the Federation of Russia Yury Chaika to verify the compliance of Uralkali with the legislation governing planning works and mines filling. Results were to be presented on 1 December 2016, but as of end January 2017 the outcome of the investigation has not been published yet.

In December 2021, Uralkali bought UPI Norte, Brazilian holding and shareholder of FertGrow S.A., local major distributor of fertilizers.

## Sponsorship

Uralkali was a minor sponsor for Sahara Force India F1 Team and its rebranded team in 2018 season.

In 2021, it was announced that Uralkali would become the title sponsor of Haas F1 Team after Nikita Mazepin, son of Dmitry Mazepin, signed with the team for the 2021 season. Uralkali also sponsors Hitech GP's cars in the GB3 Championship.

In February 2022, as a consequence of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Haas removed the branding of its sponsor Uralkali from its cars and equipment and eventually terminated Uralkali's sponsorship contract, as well as Mazepin's driver contract, which was based on the sponsorship deal, in March. In August 2024, it was reported that Haas has to reimburse US$9 million to Uralkali for the cancelled sponsorship contract by a Swiss arbitrator two months prior. This resulted in Dutch bailiffs and police entering the Haas paddock during the 2024 Dutch Grand Prix weekend to valuate their assets for Uralkali to potentially seize should the company did not receive payment by 26 August. On 23 August, Haas team owner Gene Haas confirmed the team has made the payment but it was complicated by the Russian sanctions. On 26 August, Uralkali confirmed the receipt of the payment and Haas was allowed to leave the country.
