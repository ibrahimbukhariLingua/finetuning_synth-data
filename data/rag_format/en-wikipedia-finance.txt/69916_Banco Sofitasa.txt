## History

Banco Sofitasa was originally founded as a small financial institution in the 1980sᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ by Juan Antonio Galeazzi Contreras. It was replaced in January 1990 by a regional commercial bank. In 2001, it became a universal bank, the first regional commercial bank to be approved as a universal bank in western Venezuela. Its status as a universal bank then allowed it to offer a variety of services, including leasing and real estate, investment banking, and lending. Sofitasa is a member of the Banking Association of Venezuela.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
