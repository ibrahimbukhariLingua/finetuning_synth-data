## History

Founded in 1979 as a private - public venture, it began operation in March 1980. A primary objective was to mobilize savings for long term investments in mortgage related lending to lower and middle income earners. Funds were transferred over a ten year period from an earlier initiative for urban development, a government treasury funded plan for the improvement of housing and urban development.
