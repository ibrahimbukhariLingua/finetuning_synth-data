# Samsung C&T Corporation



**Samsung Construction and Trading Corporation** (Korean: 삼성물산 주식회사; stylized as **Samsung C&T**) is a South Korean construction and engineering company. It was founded in 1938 as the first Samsung company and was initially involved in construction and overseas trading operations. Since 1995, it has largely focused on global engineering and construction projects, trade and investments, fashion and real estate. The corporation is governed by an 11-member Board of Directors, made up of the President and CEOs of its four working groups (Engineering & Construction, Trading & Investment, Fashion, and Resort), the corporation's CFO, and six independent members. Samsung C&T employs over 17,000 people. The firm is often regarded as the holding company of Samsung *chaebol* as it is a major shareholder of various Samsung affiliates.


## History

In 1975, Samsung C&T was designated by the Korean government as the first general trading company to lead overseas sales operations. After the company merged with Samsung Construction in December 1995, Samsung C&T began engaging in global business with offices in more than 50 countries.

In September 2015, Samsung C&T merged with Cheil Industries, a Korean textile firm prominent in the fashion industry that was originally acquired by Samsung Everland in December 2013. The resulting Samsung C&T focuses on fashion, food, housing, leisure, and bio businesses with its Engineering & Construction, Trading & Investment, Fashion and Resort & Construction Groups. The merger has established a third pillar for the Samsung Group, adding to its electronics and financial services.
