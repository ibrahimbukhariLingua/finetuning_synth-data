Rising steadily through the ranks, he was appointed head of European equity sales in 1988, head of proprietary trading in 1993, and head of international trading in 1994. In 1995, he joined Deutsche Morgan Grenfell as its head of equity and derivative trading.

In September 2015, they announced a long-term strategic partnership with the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), which acquired a 24.9% stake in Marshall Wace, which they increased to 29.9% in November 2017.

In 2016, *Institutional Investor* named Marshall Wace the "best-performing hedge fund in 2015", which manages $22 billion in client money.

According to The *Sunday Times Rich List* in 2020, Wace is worth £630 million.

In September 1994, Wace watched his family killed in a road crash in Hampshire. His first wife Joanne, 34, and their two children, four-year-old son Guy and 11-month daughter Alicia were killed. He married Fiona Hardy two years later and had two children Claudia and Luke; they split in 2010. In 2012, he married the model Saffron Aldridge.

In June 2017, he purchased Tanera Mòr, the largest of the Summer Isles off the northwest highlands of Scotland, for £1.7 million, far less than the £2.5 million asking price when it was put on the market in 2013. Wace will oversee a four-year development to Tanera Mòr, which could become an "idyllic retreat capable of hosting up to 60 paying guests".

In 2001, he joined with his partner Paul Marshall and Arpad Busson, another hedge fund manager, to try to address the plight of Romanian orphans in 2001. They founded Absolute Return for Kids (ARK), a children's non-profit.
