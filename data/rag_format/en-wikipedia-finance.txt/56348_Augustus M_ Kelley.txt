**Augustus M. Kelley, Publishing** was a New York-based publishing house named after its founder, Augustus M. Kelley (1913â€“1999). The exact dates of operation of the firm are not known. The concern primarily published non-fiction works and was noted for facsimile reprints of older books. Many of their books dealt with economic history and theory.

The firm was most active in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was located in New York City. By 1986, the firm had moved to Fairfield, New Jersey, where it appears to have remained.

That advertisement announced: "In America almost all D&C railway, canal and industrial archaeology titles are published by Augustus M. Kelley Publishers, 24 East 22nd Street, New York, NY 10010".
