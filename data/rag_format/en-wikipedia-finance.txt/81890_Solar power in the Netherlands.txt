Solar power in the Netherlands


# Solar power in the Netherlands



**Solar power in the Netherlands** has an installed capacity of around 23,904 megawatt (MW) of photovoltaics as of the end of 2023. Around 4,304 MW of new capacity was installed during 2023.

Market research firm GlobalData projects Dutch solar PV capacity could rise to 55,000 MW (55 GW) by 2035. Longer-term projections from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research estimate national PV capacity could reach 180 GW by 2050.


## Timeline

**2008** Subsidies of 33 euro cents per kWh were introduced but initially failed to attract much development. However, when they were curtailed, the Dutch banded together to make large purchases at discount instead.

**2011** A 500-kilowatt solar array was added to the roof of Rotterdam's central train station.

**2012** Solar capacity more than doubled to 321 MW with new added capacity of 175 MW.

**2013** According to the Dutch grid operators, solar capacity grew to a cumulative power of 655.4 MW at the end of 2013

**2014** By August 2014, the total had reached 1 GW mark for the first time.

**2015** The Netherlands saw its capacity grow by around 357 MW during 2015, the fourth highest in Europe in that year, its installed capacity per inhabitant remained low at 83.1 Watts per inhabitant compared to the European average of 186.1 Wp/inhab, in particular compared to its neighbour Belgium at 286.7 Wp/inhab.

**2016** The largest solar installation in the Netherlands, the 6 MW array at the Wadden-Island Ameland was officially opened in June 2016. Installed capacity per capita rose to 120.1 W, thirteenth position in the EU and nearer to the EU average of 197.8 W than in preceding years.

**2019** The largest solar installation in the Netherlands, the 103 MWp array in Groningen, becomes operational.

**2020** The Netherlands passed the 10.000 MWp of installed PV capacity, becoming the 10th country to pass the 10 GW barrier.

**2022** A new solar carport measuring 1 kilometer by 500 meters opened in Flevoland. The 90.000 solar panels with 35 MWp will power 10.000 households.
