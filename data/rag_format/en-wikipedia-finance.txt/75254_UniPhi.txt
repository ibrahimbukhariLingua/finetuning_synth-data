# UniPhi



**UniPhi** is a Project management software founded by Mark Heath. UniPhi spun out of mbh management in 2011 following the roll out of AECOM's Global Unite project.


## History

In 2011, UniPhi was introduced to the Global Unite initiative, which involved the implementation of a new client-servicing model. This model captured snapshots of project information from their bespoke cost estimating tools and transferred this data into UniPhi's The Enterprise software. This information then went through a new and improved quality assurance methodology, with UniPhi's software development team building a global data warehouse and analysis services model that would harvest this information to be utilised within any of the 120 offices around the globe. UniPhi's core application was licensed and deployed globally to provide the core architecture of cost plan data capture in a way that enabled portfolio benchmarking. This increased speed to market and generated cost savings.

Another organization that used the software in 2011 was SKM. When the people in charge of the Queensland Flood Recovery road reconstruction program were planning the A$800 million venture, they realized that traditional project management using spreadsheets and Gantt charts would be insufficient.
