# Money (financial website)



***Money*** is an American brand and a personal finance website owned by Money Group. From its 1972 founding until 2018, it was a monthly magazine published by Time Inc. and subsequently by Meredith Corporation from 2018 to 2019. Its articles cover the gamut of personal finance topics ranging from credit cards, mortgages, insurance, banking, and investing to family finance issues, including paying for college, credit, career, and home improvement. It also publishes an annual list of "America's Best Places to Live".


## History

The first issue of *Money* magazine was published in October 1972 by Time Inc. The magazine, along with *Fortune*, partnered with sister cable network CNN in CNNMoney.com after the discontinuation of the CNNfn business news channel in 2005. In 2014, after Time Inc.'s spin-off from its parent company Time Warner, which also owned CNN, Money launched its website, Money.com.

After Meredith Corporation acquired Time Inc. at the beginning of 2018, *Money* was put up for sale. In April 2019, Meredith announced the discontinuation of Money's print publication, focusing instead on its digital platform, Money.com. The last print issue was published in June 2019.

In October 2019, Meredith Corporation sold the *Money* brand and website to Money Group, formerly known as Ad Practitioners LLC, a Puerto Rico-based media and advertising company which operates ConsumersAdvocate.org. In 2023, Money added *Best Cars* and *Best Hospitals* to their roster of flagships, joining their existing *Best Places to Live*, *Best Places to Travel*, *Best Colleges*, and *Best Banks* annual franchises.
