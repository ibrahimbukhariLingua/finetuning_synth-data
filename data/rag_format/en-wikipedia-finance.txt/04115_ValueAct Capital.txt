**ValueAct Capital** is a San Francisco-based investment company with a portfolio value calculated at about $9.269 billion on behalf of several institutional and individual investors. The company is a privately owned hedge fund that invests in the public equity markets.


## Background

The firm was led by Jeff Ubben from its founding until 2020 when Mason Morfit became CEO. In 2024, Rob Hale was elevated to the role of Co-CEO alongside Morfit.


## Investor actions

ValueAct Capital is a very active investor that identifies companies that appear to be out of favor or may be undergoing a significant transition. ValueAct makes a significant investment into the company and then works with the company to make changes with the goal of increasing long-term stock value and thus creating a profit for ValueAct.


### Rolls-Royce

In August 2020, the company sold all of the stake capital of Rolls-Royce.


### Microsoft

In May 2013 ValueAct Capital revealed that it had purchased $2 billion worth of Microsoft stock (less than 1%). Shortly thereafter the company announced that Steve Ballmer decided to leave Microsoft. The company subsequently announced an agreement to share information and work with ValueAct, as well as to give ValueAct an option to join the board of directors. It was speculated that pressure from ValueAct led to Ballmer's decision to leave the company but both Ballmer and Microsoft have said otherwise. Morfit joined the Microsoft Board of Directors in early 2014 and served until late 2017 during which time the company thrived under new CEO Satya Nadella.
