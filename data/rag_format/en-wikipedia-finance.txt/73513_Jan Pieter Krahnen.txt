Between 2008 and 2012 Krahnen was a member of a German government expert group that drew up proposals on how to reform international financial markets. The Commission chaired by the former Chief economist of the European Central Bank, Otmar Issing, (thus also known as “Issing Commission”) published six reports.

In February 2012, EU Commissioner Michel Barnier invited Krahnen to join a high-level expert group to examine possible reforms to the structure of the EU banking sector. Krahnen was the only German member of this group which was chaired by Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, and consisted of eleven people in total. On 2 October 2012 the group published their report.
