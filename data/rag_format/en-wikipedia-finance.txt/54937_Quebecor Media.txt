**Quebecor Media Inc.** is a Canadian media conglomerate that owns a wide array of media outlets, as well as an internet service provider.


## History

In 1983 Quebecor purchased the Winnipeg Sun newspaper, which had been independently run. The newspaper was later sold to the Postmedia chain.

In August 2000, Quebecor Media bought Vidéotron for CA$4.9 billion. In May 2001, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the transfer of broadcasting licenses from Vidéotron to Quebecor Media. Also in 2001, Quebecor Media bought Groupe TVA.

As of June 2018, Quebecor Inc. fully owns Quebecor Media, while CDP Capital d’Amérique Investissements Inc. (a subsidiary of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the provincial pension fund) previously owned an 18.9% share. On May 8, 2018, Quebecor had announced its intent to buy out the remainder of the Caisse's stake for $1.69 billion in cash and stock.
