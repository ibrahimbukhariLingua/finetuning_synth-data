In November 2005, Enterasys was acquired by Alec Gores' private equity firm, Gores Group, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, in a going-private transaction estimated at $386 million. In April 2006, The Gores Group named Mike Fabiaschi as CEO. Fabiaschi had to deal with renewing trust relationships with customers, to "fix the company." In 2008, Enterasys sought to increase revenue to $1 billion and make one or two acquisitions.

The Gores Group acquired a 51% stake in Siemens Enterprise Communications (SEN). As part of the $550 million transaction, Gores Group offered two of its assets: Enterasys and SER Solutions, a Virginia-based contacts management provider.

On September 22, 2008, Fabiaschi died suddenly. Mark Stone, chairman of the board, was named interim CEO and completed the joint venture transaction. Chris Crowell became CEO and president of Enterasys.

Enterasys enterprise networking and SEN's telephony and wireless products were integrated.
