## Career

In 1973, Shinohara founded Tempstaff from a one-bedroom apartment after returning to Japan after living abroad in Europe and Australia where she saw women working as temps. She was 38 and had recently divorced her husband. At the time, it was unusual for Japanese women to do paid work let alone start a company and, initially, her company was in violation of the law which did not allow for temporary employment. The company was initially staffed entirely by women but began hiring men in 1988.

Shinohara retired from her role as chairman of the company in 2016 while retaining the title of chairman emeritus. As of 2020ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, she had an 11% stake in Persol Holdings. In early 2023ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, she became Japan's first self-made woman billionaire as shares in her company boomed. *Forbes* estimated her net worth at $965 million in 2023.

She has described her management approach as "start small, grow it large” explaining that "women have the knack of steadily building a businesses as well as being able to give form to ideas that are close at hand."

## Philanthropy and advocacy

In 2016, she donated $140 million of stock to endow the Yoshiko Shinohara Memorial Foundation which would fund scholarships for students studying to become nurses, social worker or day-care staff.

She is an advocate for government policies that encourage more women to enter the workforce.
