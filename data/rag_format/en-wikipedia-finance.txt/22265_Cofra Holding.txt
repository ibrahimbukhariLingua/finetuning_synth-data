### Sustainable food

In November 2021, Cofra announced an investment in Scotland-based vertical farmer *Intelligent Growth Solutions* as part of its Series B Funding round, which also included Cleveland Avenue LLC (Chicago) and DC Thomson (Dundee, Scotland) as investors.

In January 2022, Cofra took over the Dutch greenhouse manufacturer Dalsem. In April 2022, Cofra Holding announced the acquisition of Ontario Plants Propagation.


## Management and business practices

Cofra is a privately held company owned by a group of around 60 descendants of Clemens and August Brenninkmeijer. The group is also known as the “Sneekerkring”, a reference to the town of Sneek, where C&A was founded. Within the group of family owners, key decisions are taken on the basis of consensus rather than voting. Martijn Brenninkmeijer is the chairman of Cofra's executive board. In a 2016 Die Zeit interview with Maurice Brenninkmeijer, Götz Hamann and Uew Jean Heuser wrote that company shares cannot be inherited; they can only be obtained by family members who serve as Cofra executives.
