# Kazakhstan Stock Exchange



The **Kazakhstan Stock Exchange** (**KASE**; Kazakh: Қазақстан қор биржасы, romanized: *Qazaqstan qor bırjasy*) is a stock exchange located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The exchange was founded in 1993.


## History

On November 15, 1993, Kazakhstan introduced its own currency, the tenge. The next day, November 17, 1993, the National Bank of Kazakhstan and 23 local leading commercial banks took a decision to found a currency exchange. The previously existing Center for execution of inter-bank currency transactions (Currency exchange) used to be a structural unit of Kazakhstan's National Bank. The main task assigned to the new exchange was to set up and develop the national currency market following the introduction of the tenge. The exchange was incorporated as a closed joint-stock company on December 30, 1993, under the name Kazakhstan Inter-Bank Currency Exchange.

On March 3, 1994, the exchange was re-registered under the name Kazakhstan Interbank Currency Exchange due to the need to match the exchange's name to the current legislation.

On July 12, 1995, the exchange was re-registered under the name Kazakhstan Inter-Bank Currency and Stock Exchange following the shareholders' decision to let the exchange begin operating on the securities market. On October 2, 1995, the exchange obtained license No. 1 to carry stock exchange transactions, however this license only covered the right to operate trading in government securities only.
On April 12, 1996, the exchange was re-registered under the name Kazakhstan Stock Exchange, since the current legislation banned the stock exchange from carrying out functions of a commodity exchange. On November 13, 1996, the exchange obtained an unlimited license to operate securities trading from the National Commission of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Securities.

Since the new Act of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Securities" dated March 5, 1997 restricted the stock exchange's operation to securities only, the general meeting of shareholders in April 1997 decided to reorganize it by making it separate closed joint-stock company Almaty Financial Instruments Exchange (AFINEX), which was registered on July 30, 1997. As of September 1, 1997 the trading in foreign currencies and futures contracts moved to the AFINEX trading floor. The exchange itself underwent a re-registration in July 1997 retaining its former name.

With the Act of the Republic of Kazakhstan "On Making Changes and Additions to Some Legal Acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan Regarding Joint-Stock Companies" of July 10, 1998 coming into effect, the ban prohibiting the exchange to operate trading in foreign currencies and financial instruments other than securities, was lifted, which made it possible to affiliate the AFINEX to the exchange. The relevant decision was taken at a general meeting of shareholders on January 6, 1999, and on March 16, 1999, an appropriate state re-registration of the reunited exchange was effected.

On December 15, 2006, KASE was authorized as a special trading floor of the regional financial center of Almaty. On August 23, 2007, a general meeting of KASE shareholders took a decision to commercialize KASE. As part of KASE commercialization, the former voting principle "one shareholder – one vote" was scrapped and the traditional principle "one share – one vote at the general meeting" was adopted.

### Foreign currencies market

The currency market is one of the first markets organized on KASE and it has been operating since the latter's inception. The first foreign currency trading in US dollars took place in 1993. Today, transactions on this market account for about half of the total volume of trade on KASE. Main participants of KASE currency market are Kazakhstan's second-tier banks and the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Currently, trading on KASE is conducted in US dollars, euros, Chinese yuan and the Russian Ruble and the tenge, as is Euro-USD trading. Pairs USD/KZT and EUR/KZT along with regular transactions are traded as currency swaps with terms of one and two days.

Traditionally, USD/KZT trades make up more than 95% of the turnover in the foreign currency market. Throughout the day, KASE holds three foreign currency trading sessions: morning, afternoon and evening sessions. The first two are dedicated to trades settled on the day of transaction and in the evening session currency is traded according to the Т+1 and Т+2 settlement schemes.

At the end of a trading day, KASE performs net-clearing of each currency instrument. Settlements are made by KASE Settlements department based on data provided by the Clearing department according to the DVP (Delivery Versus Payment) principle. Most currency market members work on KASE in the mode of immediate delivery of tenge and foreign currency. New currency market members and (or) particular banks prone to risks are required to pre-deliver the currency being sold.

The banks acting as correspondents of KASE are:

* National bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (KZT);
* Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (USD);
* The Bank of New York Mellon (USD);
* Citibank N.A. (USD, EUR);
* Commerzbank AG (EUR);
* Sberbank of Russia (RUB);
* Bank of China (CNY).

KASE's currency market plays an important role in Kazakhstan's economy. In recent years, its share in the total turnover on Kazakhstan's interbank currency market has been between 50 and 83%. This is where the average-weighted USD/KZT exchange rate is fixed, which is used as the official exchange rate by the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan the next day.


### Securities market


#### Government securities

This sector features bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan as well as by local executive authorities. All municipal bonds and bonds of the Ministry of Finance are offered in KASE trading system. The National Bank offers its notes independently.

In recent years, there have been at least 200 government securities worth a total of about US$1.7 billion in constant circulation on KASE.


#### Equity securities

Today, this sector trades financial instruments of over 80 issuers, mainly stocks of local and foreign companies. The total shares market capitalization makes up more than US$42.5 billion. The main bulk of the market is occupied by companies from mining, energy and financial sectors.


#### Corporate debt securities

There are around 288 corporate bonds listing on KASE issued by more than 75 domestic and foreign companies in accordance with Kazakh and foreign legislations. The total amount of debt available for trade on KASE is valued at approximately US$300 million. The official list is dominated by bonds issued by banks. Companies from other sectors form an insignificant share.


#### Settlements on the securities market

All settlements on securities transactions on KASE are executed by the Central Securities Depository (CSD) in the "transaction after transaction" mode on the day of transaction conclusion (using the T+0 scheme with full advance payment). The DVP principle is applied and prior to making a transaction, the money and securities which are the subject of the transaction should be in the CSD's accounts.

In order to increase the effectiveness of the stock market's settlement infrastructure and to attract foreign investors on to KASE, the Exchange is working along several lines. They include the introduction to the securities market of the multilateral net clearing and settlements using the Т+n (0<n<4) settlement scheme with partial securing of transactions and a modern system of risk management. This system is based on the use of margining and special clearing (guarantee and reserve) funds.


### Repo transactions market

One of the largest segments of KASE is the repo transactions market, which traditionally accounts for almost half of the total volume of exchange trading. It features two sectors: the "nego" repo market where deals are carried by way of direct (negotiable) transactions and the "auto" repo market. In the latter case, the question is about the anonymous trades using the order-driven market method in which Kazakhstan's tenge is offered, and the repo interest rate means the price. The terms of the repo transactions are standard.

Government and corporate securities may be the subject of repo transactions on KASE.

The risk management system in the automatic repo market is based on limiting the term of the repo transactions to thirty days and binding the repo item to the market price. Should the closing transaction fail, the repo item will stay with the party to the transaction who gave money. In the "nego" repo market, where the term is limited to 90 days, the system of regular market revaluation of obligations and compensations ("mark-to-market") has been in place since 2010.

All settlements are made through the CSD using the same scheme as the one used to settle securities trades.


### Derivatives market

In 2010, KASE instituted a reset of the derivatives market using a modern risk management system which meets international standards. This sector has opened trade in three-month and six-month futures on USD/KZT rate and on the KASE Index. The Exchange acts as the central counteragent for each transaction being concluded and ensures unconditional execution of transactions within amounts of reserve and guarantee funds. Limits were set for both open position and price change for the purpose of minimizing settlement risks.

Since February 1, 2012 a new unit, the Clearing department, has been operating on the Exchange. Based on results of a trading day the Clearing department executes clearing using multi-party netting and generates a report on net liabilities/net claims of clearing participants.
