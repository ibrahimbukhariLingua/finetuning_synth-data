## Origin and history

In 1953, Jay Pritzker and Robert Pritzker acquired Colson Corporation, a struggling manufacturer of casters, bicycles, navy rockets, and wheelchairs with sales of $3 million.

The name of the company was changed to Marmon Group in 1964, after the acquisition of Marmon-Herrington. Major acquisitions by Marmon Group have included Cerro Corporation (1976) and TransUnion (1981).

In 2008, the Pritzker family sold a 63.6 percent interest in Marmon Group to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.8 billion, with plans for Berkshire to acquire the remaining 36.4% over the course of the next 5â€“6 years; the sale of the remaining stake to Berkshire was completed by 2013.
