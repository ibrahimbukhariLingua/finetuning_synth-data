Gross was its retired president. His father is also a breeder of thoroughbred race horses at his CandyLand Stables in Middletown, Delaware.

## Career

Moelis began his career at Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1981 where he would ultimately serve as a managing director working for Michael Milken in the firm's Los Angeles office.

Moelis recruited more than 70 senior investment bankers to UBS within three months of his arrival.

In his six years at UBS, Moelis ultimately assumed the role of president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited with the build-out of UBS's investment banking operation in the United States. By the end of 2006, UBS was ranked Top 4 in the global fee pool for the first time.
