GoodData is a business intelligence and analytics company that is known primarily for its embedded analytics and internal analytics solutions. In 2021, it expanded its cache of capabilities to include GoodData.CN (GoodData Cloud Native) and composable data and analytics.

GoodData launched a VS Code plugin. It promises to bring the power of software engineering workflow to the realm of analytics, delivering versioning, collaboration, and automation benefits to analytics and DevOps engineers.

On October 17, 2023, GoodData introduced FlexQuery Analytics Lake, an end-to-end data platform that manages metadata, materialized metrics, federated datasets, result caches, predictive models, analytics code, and leverages storage, compute, semantics, and reporting within an open, API-first analytics-as-code architecture with built-in AI acceleration. The platform provides a seamless collaboration point for every data persona, combining the power of code-based automation with no-code/low-code environments. The first phase of this vision, FlexCache, was introduced in order to reduce query times and save costs by minimizing unpredictable and expensive cloud data warehouse query processing.

A few months later, on March 25, 2024, GoodData announced a major update to FlexQuery. FlexQuery is a composable data service layer built on Apache Arrow and Iceberg. With FlexQuery, GoodData says users can save costs through efficient caching, transform and federate data with agility, and build using the best open-source tools.
