In 2023, Bachiashvili was charged with misappropriation of cryptocurrency and alleged money laundering. Bachiashvili invested in mining of Bitcoin cryptocurrency in the summer of 2015 using money “personally raised” by him. The mining services were provided by a foreign firm to an enterprise owned by Bachiashvili under a one-year contract valued at $6.3 million, including a $5 million share by the investor. The operation generated 24,661.85 bitcoins throughout a year, resulting in the profit of 8,253.13 bitcoins, which were appropriated by Bachiashvili in 2017 and with only $536,900 paid to the investors as their share of the profit. The amount of appropriated bitcoins equalled over $39 million.
