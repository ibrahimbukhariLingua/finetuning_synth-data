Three miniature sheets were issued which were intended to raise funds for the exhibition but in fact they raised far more than was expected and the excess formed the trust's original endowment. This was supplemented with funds raised for Stamp World London 1990 and additional donations by the Royal Mail and others since.


## Objectives
