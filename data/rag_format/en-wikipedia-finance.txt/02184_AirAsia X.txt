AirAsia X


# AirAsia X



**AirAsia X Berhad**, operating as **AirAsia X** (formerly **FlyAsianXpress Sdn. Bhd.**), is a Malaysian long-haul, low-cost airline and a subsidiary of the AirAsia Group. The airline was initially established in 2006 as FlyAsian Express (FAX) and began by operating regional routes under Malaysia’s Rural Air Service. After encountering operational challenges, FAX transitioned to a long-haul, low-cost carrier model and rebranded as AirAsia X in 2007. It launched its first international flight in November 2007, connecting Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast, Australia.

AirAsia X expanded its network over the following years, establishing routes to various destinations across Australia, Europe and Asia. Despite challenges such as fluctuating fuel prices and increased competition, the airline focused on strategic growth through fleet expansion and operational improvements. In 2013, AirAsia X went public with an initial public offering (IPO) on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a suspension of operations and the airline underwent a debt restructuring process. By 2022, AirAsia X had repositioned itself for recovery and by 2023, it experienced growth, particularly in passenger numbers and route expansion. In 2024, the airline continued its recovery with a focus on international expansion, including launching flights Nairobi, Kenya and Almaty, Kazakhstan, marking its entry into the African and Central Asian markets.

In 2024, AirAsia X and AirAsia announced plans to merge under a single unified brand, AirAsia Group. This strategic move aims to streamline operations, improve efficiency and strengthen the airline's competitive position in the global market.


## History


### FlyAsianXpress


#### 2006-2007: Early Operations and Strategic Realignment

AirAsia X traces its origins to FlyAsianExpress (FAX), a regional airline established in 2006 as a subsidiary of AirAsia. The airline was tasked with operating Malaysia's Rural Air Service routes (RAS), focusing on providing affordable air travel to underserved areas, particularly in Malaysian Borneo. This initiative aimed to enhance regional connectivity and align with AirAsia's mission of making air travel accessible to everyone.

Despite its ambitions, FAX encountered operational difficulties, such as low passenger demand on certain routes, maintenance issues and occasional flight cancellations. These issues affected the airline’s ability to maintain consistent service and raised concerns about its sustainability.

By early 2007, the mounting challenges prompted calls for a more experienced operator to take over the RAS routes. On April 11, 2007, Tony Fernandes, CEO of AirAsia, proposed transferring the operations to Firefly, a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines with greater expertise in turboprop services. After receiving government approval, the transfer was completed on April 26, 2007, ending FAX's involvement in the RAS network. The RAS flights in Malaysian Borneo were subsequently managed by a newly created airline, MASwings, owned by Malaysia Airlines.

#### 2007: The Launch and Rebranding of AirAsia X

The airline shifted its focus to long-haul, low-cost operations in 2007, marking a significant turning point. This transition led to its rebranding as AirAsia X in September of the same year. The name "AirAsia X" was inspired by Yoshiki, the leader of the Japanese rock band X Japan, as revealed by Tony Fernandes.

To support its launch, Richard Branson's Virgin Group acquired a 20% stake in AirAsia X to finance aircraft purchases and operations. Branson also highlighted opportunities for collaboration with Virgin Blue, including codeshare agreements and loyalty programs, to improve connectivity and passenger benefits.

On September 15, 2007, the airline took delivery of its first aircraft at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The aircraft was named *"Semangat Sir Freddie"* ("Spirit of Sir Freddie") in tribute to Sir Freddie Laker, a pioneer of low-cost aviation and founder of the Skytrain service.

The airline's inaugural long-haul flight departed from Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast Airport in Australia on November 2, 2007, offering promotional fares as low as MYR 50 (USD 17). This flight marked a significant milestone in the airline's expansion into international markets.


#### 2008-2009: Long-Haul Expansions to Australia, China and Europe

Following its rebranding, AirAsia X rapidly expanded its network, starting with destinations in Australia, including Melbourne and Perth, as well as Hangzhou, China. To maintain its cost-effective model, the airline avoided high-cost airports like Sydney, focusing instead on more economical hubs to enhance operational efficiency and sustain competitive pricing.

In 2009, AirAsia X expanded its operations to Europe with the launch of direct flights from Kuala Lumpur to London-Stansted, marking its entry into the intercontinental market, later shifting the service to London-Gatwick in 2011. The airline expanded further in 2010 by adding Paris-Orly Airport to its network. This growth made AirAsia X the first budget carrier to serve the Kangaroo Route, connecting long-haul travel between Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe.


#### 2010-2012: Balancing Growth and Sustainability

After experiencing early success, AirAsia X faced significant challenges starting in 2010. Rising fuel costs and intensified competition in the long-haul sector pressured the airline’s profitability and cost management. In response, the airline reassessed its network, focusing on optimizing its routes and operations. This period marked the beginning of various adjustments aimed at maintaining its low-cost business model.

By 2012, AirAsia X had to withdraw from several unprofitable routes, such as Delhi, Mumbai, Paris and London, citing high operational costs and insufficient demand. Despite these setbacks, the airline continued to seek new growth opportunities, launching flights to Sydney in April and Beijing in June. However, it had to suspend services to Tianjin and Tehran due to economic and operational challenges. This phase of trial and error highlighted AirAsia X’s ongoing efforts to balance expansion with long-term sustainability in a highly competitive market.


#### 2013-2018: Strengthening Operations and Expanding Global Footprint

AirAsia X made a significant move in 2013 by launching an initial public offering (IPO) on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange, raising MYR 988 million (USD 310 million). These funds were allocated towards expanding its fleet and enhancing operations, supporting the airline’s long-term growth plans. That same year, the airline intensified its focus on the Asia-Pacific region, capitalizing on the increasing demand for affordable travel within the area.

Fleet expansion became a key priority, with AirAsia X acquiring more Airbus A330 aircraft to strengthen its long-haul network. By 2015, the airline had introduced new destinations, including Sapporo, Japan, further extending its global reach. Despite these successes, fluctuating fuel prices and heightened competition presented ongoing challenges, requiring continual adjustments to its strategies.

In response to growing demand, the airline increased frequencies on popular routes and, by 2016, placed greater emphasis on operational efficiency. This included optimizing schedules, reducing costs, and improving load factors. The introduction of new technology solutions also helped streamline operations and enhance customer engagement.

The expansion continued into 2017, with AirAsia X launching flights to Honolulu, Hawaii, in June and Jeju, South Korea, in December. In 2018, the airline moved its Melbourne operations to Avalon Airport to reduce costs while maintaining service quality. 2019, the airline had added several new international routes from Kuala Lumpur, including services to Fukuoka, Lanzhou, Taipei, Osaka, Tokyo (Narita) and Singapore.


#### 2020-2022: Navigating the Pandemic and Operational Recovery

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused major disruptions to global travel, forcing AirAsia X to suspend its operations in March. The halt in services resulted in significant financial strain, leading the airline to begin a debt restructuring process in October 2020. In 2021, AirAsia X entered a hibernation phase, conserving its resources while preparing for a phased recovery. During this period, the airline worked on revamping its business model to ensure long-term sustainability in the post-pandemic landscape.

By March 2022, AirAsia X successfully completed its debt restructuring with court approval. The airline then began to gradually resume services, prioritizing profitable routes such as Seoul and Delhi, starting in April. This restructuring allowed AirAsia X to streamline its operations and reposition itself strategically for recovery in the evolving travel market.


#### 2023–Present: Rebuilding and the Path to Unification

AirAsia X’s recovery efforts gained momentum in 2023, with the airline carrying over 2.8 million passengers, a remarkable 6.8-fold increase compared to the previous year. The airline achieved a passenger load factor (PLF) of 80%, driven by increased frequencies on key routes such as Seoul, Sydney and Melbourne. In Q4 2023, AirAsia X saw a 2.6-fold year-on-year growth, carrying 890,289 passengers and achieving a PLF of 82%.

The airline continued its recovery trajectory by expanding its global reach, launching its first flight to Nairobi, Kenya in November 2024, marking its entry into the African market. Additionally, it introduced flights to Almaty, Kazakhstan, reflecting a strategic focus on exploring underserved regions. As of 2024, the airline operates 22 destinations from Kuala Lumpur International Airport as part of its continued recovery and growth strategy.

In December 2024, Tony Fernandes, the CEO of Capital A, confirmed that AirAsia X and AirAsia would merge under a single unified brand, AirAsia Group. This strategic initiative aimed to simplify the airline's operational structure and consolidate its market presence. By uniting the long-haul and short-haul operations under one brand, the airline group sought to enhance efficiency and strengthen its position within the aviation industry.

### Fleet development

In 2009, AirAsia X placed an order for 10 Airbus A350-900 aircraft but canceled the order in April 2018 due to rising prices. During a business forum in Manila in February 2018, Tony Fernandes revealed that the airline was considering the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for fleet expansion. However, a month later, the decision was made not to pursue the Boeing aircraft.

By September 2018, reports indicated that AirAsia X was exploring the use of Airbus A321neo and A321LR aircraft alongside its Airbus A330 fleet. The airline believed that using narrow-body aircraft on shorter routes, with a maximum flight time of 7.9 hours, could result in cost savings of up to 16% on variable costs and 5% on fixed costs.

In March 2020, AirAsia X announced that the delivery of its Airbus A330-900 aircraft would be delayed indefinitely. This decision was made in response to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by June 2022, the airline confirmed its commitment to receiving Airbus A330neos and A321XLRs, with deliveries expected to begin in 2026, as it gradually resumed operations after a two-year hiatus.


## Corporate affairs


### Headquarters and Corporate Office

The head office and registered office of AirAsia X are currently located at the RedQ facility at Kuala Lumpur International Airport Terminal 2 in Sepang, Selangor. The airline's previous head office was at the LCC Terminal at KLIA, while its registered office was situated on Level 12 of Menara Prima Tower B in Petaling Jaya, Selangor.

AirAsia X had planned to relocate to a new 613,383-square-foot (56,985.1 m²) facility at klia2, which was completed to house around 2,000 AirAsia and AirAsia X employees. The new headquarters, known as "RedQuarters" or "RedQ," was named by Filipina flight attendant January Ann Baysa, and its groundbreaking ceremony took place in November 2014.


### Cost Structure and Operational Efficiency

AirAsia X operates with one of the lowest costs among long-haul airlines globally, with a Cost per Available Seat-Kilometre (CASK) of US$0.0351 in 2015, or US$0.0240 excluding fuel costs. This enables the airline to offer fares 30 to 50% lower than traditional long-haul carriers. The airline also collaborates with its affiliate, AirAsia, to streamline operations, such as staff management, fuel hedging, marketing and computer systems, benefiting from economies of scale typically unavailable to smaller airlines.


### Shareholders

The entry of two major investors provided AirAsia X with crucial financial support for its future expansion plans. This investment was aimed at assisting the airline's growth and development.

As of 14 February 2008, Aero Ventures, a venture involving Tony Fernandes, other prominent Malaysians and Air Canada's Robert Milton, owned 48% of AirAsia X. Virgin Group held a 16% stake, while AirAsia owned an additional 16%. Bahrain-based Manara Consortium and Japan's Orix Corp acquired a combined 20% stake in AirAsia X for RM250 million.

AirAsia X was listed on Bursa Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) on 10 July 2013, with shares offered to both individual and institutional investors at MYR1.25 (approximately US$0.39) per share. The listing raised MYR988 million (US$310 million at 2013 exchange rates) and valued the company at MYR3 billion (US$940 million). The shares performed poorly on their first day, closing unchanged and recording what Bloomberg described as the "second-worst trading debut in Malaysia" that year. As of 10 October 2016, shares were priced at MYR0.39, giving the company a market value of MYR1.62 billion (US$390 million at 2016 exchange rates). As of 10 October 2016, shares of AirAsia X Berhad were trading at MYR0.39, giving the company a market value of MYR1.62 billion (US$390 million at 2016 exchange rates).

According to data from Bloomberg cited by The Edge in February 2022, the largest shareholder of AirAsia X Berhad was Tune Group, a private investment vehicle owned by Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun, holding a 17.8% stake. The two collectively held an indirect stake of 31.59%, with Capital A, the parent company of AirAsia, owning an additional 13.8%.


## Affiliate airlines


### Indonesia AirAsia X

Indonesia AirAsia X was the medium and long-haul division of Indonesia AirAsia, operating cost-efficient services with shared ticketing, aircraft livery, and management style. It initially served medium-haul routes from Bali to Mumbai and Tokyo, and short-haul flights from Jakarta, Denpasar and Surabaya. However, it faced disruptions, including the cancellation of its Melbourne route in 2014 due to lack of government approval, and ended its Taipei route in September 2015.

In late 2018, the airline announced it would cease scheduled operations by January 2019, transitioning to non-scheduled services. It ultimately ceased all operations and was liquidated on 17 October 2020 as part of AirAsia's restructuring.


### Thai AirAsia X

Thai AirAsia X, a joint venture between AirAsia and Thai entrepreneurs Tassapon Bijleveld and Julpas Krueospon, was established on 18 September 2013, with AirAsia holding a 49% stake. The airline, as the long-haul arm of Thai AirAsia, commenced operations in June 2014 with its first flight to Seoul and expanded to other destinations such as Osaka and Tokyo. It operates with shared systems, aircraft livery, and management styles, benefiting from cost efficiencies.

In December 2016, Thai AirAsia X ended its Middle East routes, and in August 2019, it took delivery of its first Airbus A330neo. After facing disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a suspension of domestic flights in 2021, the airline announced in 2022 that it would relocate its operations to Suvarnabhumi Airport and filed for bankruptcy, which did not affect its ongoing services.
