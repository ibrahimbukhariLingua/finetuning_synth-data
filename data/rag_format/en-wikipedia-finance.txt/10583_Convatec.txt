## History

The company was established as a division of E.R. Squibb & Sons, Inc. in 1978 and acquired by Nordic Capital and Avista Capital Partners in 2008. In 2008 merged with Unomedical (with headquarters in Denmark), a manufacturer of single-use medical devices,
and 180 Medical, a catheter manufacturer, in 2012.

In June 2015 the company won a Court of Appeal ruling that determined that in the context of a patent "between 1% and 25%" should be interpreted rounding to the nearest 1%, so that an attempt to circumvent a patent by using the value 0.9% failed. In October 2016 the company was valued at Â£4.4bn in the largest initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in the year.

On 15 October 2018, Convatec announced that Paul Moraviec would be retiring as CEO with immediate effect, and would be succeeded on an interim basis by non-executive director Rick Anderson, who was formerly the chairman of Johnson & Johnson.

On 25 March 2019, Convatec announced Karim Bitar, formerly CEO of Genus Plc, had been appointed CEO and would join the business on 30 September 2019.

On 19 August 2019, Convatec announced Dr John McAdam CBE would become Chairman, effective 30 September, the same day Karim Bitar became CEO.


## Controversies


### Operations in Russia

ConvaTec faced criticism for maintaining its operations in Russia during the ongoing war in Ukraine. While many companies ceased or reduced their presence in Russia, ConvaTec continued its business activities there, including the sale of medical products. In 2023, ConvaTec was included in the "Leave Russia" project, which tracks companies that remain active in the Russian market. Critics argued that by continuing operations in Russia, ConvaTec indirectly supported the Russian economy and government during the conflict.


## Operations

The company has 10,000 employees and operates in more than 100 countries.
