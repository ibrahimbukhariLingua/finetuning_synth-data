## History

The Chung Nam Group of Companies is based in Hong Kong, tracing its origin back over 70 years. The late Mr. and Mrs. Chong Ching Um founded the group in 1935, engaging in export, manufacturing, and trading in the Southeast Asian markets.

During the 1980s, China’s open door policy enabled the group to concentrate more on manufacturing and embark on the development of precision engineering. During the 1990s, to maintain a leading position in manufacturing, the group began investing in technology and hardware for critical processes. Towards 2000, in-house research and development resulted in a breakthrough with different patents being filed. The group gradually became diversified through acquisitions and establishing new joint ventures.

The group is headquartered in Hong Kong and employs over 100,000 people all over the world. Its managing director is Bob Chong. The group has a focused structure operating with two platforms:

1. Technology and Manufacturing,
2. Distribution and Retailing.
