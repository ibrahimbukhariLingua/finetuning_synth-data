Jewish Future Promise


# Jewish Future Promise



The **Jewish Future Promise**, originally **Jewish Future Pledge**, is a charitable campaign modeled after The Giving Pledge, to encourage American Jews to designate at least 50% of their charitable giving to Jewish- or Israel-related causes. Over 80,000 people has signed the pledge since its inception in May 2020.


## History

Co-creators Michael Leven and Amy Holtz launched the pledge in May 2020, modeled after The Giving Pledge, to encourage American Jews to designate at least 50% of their charitable giving to Jewish- or Israel-related causes. According to Leven and Holtz, Americans will donate $68 trillion in wealth over the next generation, 20% of which will be given by Jewish donors. The pledge's aim is for at least half of that 20%, or more than $600 billion, to go to Jewish causes, compared to the estimated 11% of donations that do now. The Pledge partnered with the Jewish Federations of North America, Jewish National Fund, and Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi to integrate the pledge into traditional vehicles of Jewish philanthropy. The Pledge partnered with Morgan Stanley to create a donor-advised fund.

In 2023, the Pledge launched the Jewish Youth Pledge for people aged 13-24 to commit to being active members of the Jewish community.

On February 8, 2024, the Pledge changed its named to the Jewish Future Promise.
