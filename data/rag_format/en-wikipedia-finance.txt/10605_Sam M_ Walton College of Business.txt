# Sam M. Walton College of Business



The **Sam M. Walton College of Business** (**Walton College** or **Walton**) is the business school at the University of Arkansas, a public research university in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Created in 1926, the college is the second-largest college at the University of Arkansas, serving over 9,000 students. Walton College offers undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs and is known nationally for its strong programs in retail, entrepreneurship, information systems, and supply chain management. *U.S. News & World Report* consistently ranks Walton College among the top business schools in the country. The college has a close relationship with Walmart Stores, Inc., based in nearby Bentonville, Arkansas, and related vendor community.


## History

The School of Business Administration was founded in 1926 by Harvard graduate Charles C. Fichtner, who became the college's first dean. The original curricula covered accounting, banking, finance, general business, industrial management, and marketing. The college gained accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, also known as AACSB International, in 1931.

A $100,000 donation from business owner Barney Lewis, class of 1934, helped establish a professional development program at the college that would later become the Leadership Walton program. In 1996, the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation gifted the college $6.7 million, which funded the Reynolds Center for Enterprise Development.


### Eponym

The college is named after the founder of Walmart Stores, Inc., Sam Walton, when in October 1998, the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation made a $50 million upfront cash gift. The company is headquartered in nearby Bentonville, Arkansas, and employs hundreds of Walton College graduates. This was the largest ever given to a public business college at the time. This established the "Sam M. Walton College of Business Administration", but the name was shorted to the "Sam M. Walton College of Business" in 2000.

Walmart's Live Better U education program offers free tuition and books for Walmart associates looking to earn undergraduate degrees in supply chain management, marketing and general business from Walton College.

## Facilities

Business education at the University of Arkansas began on the third floor Old Main in 1926. Known as the **School of Business Administration**, four faculty and 21 students began business education at UA. In 1928, the school moved to the former engineering building, which was renamed the Commerce Building.

The College moved to its present location at 220 North McIlroy in 1978 following the completion of the Business Building. It was renamed to **Sam M. Walton College of Business Administration** following a $50 million donation from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation in 1998. The Donald W. Reynolds Center for Enterprise Development at 145 North Buchanan was built following a grant from Donald W. Reynolds Foundation in 1996.

Following the Campaign for the 21st Century, the Walton College saw a period of rapid facility growth. Willard J. Walker Hall at 191 North Harmon and the J.B. Hunt Transport Services Center for Academic Excellence at 227 North Harmon opened in 2007 adjacent to the Business Building, enclosing the **Linda Sue Shollmier Plaza** and creating a business campus within the southern part of the UA campus. The McMillon Innovation Studio, named for alumnus Doug McMillon, was opened in a former retail space at 146 North Harmon near the other business buildings in 2016.
