## Career

From September 1990 to January 1991, Michael Desmond served as legislative assistant for Congressman Douglas H. Bosco. From February 1991 to June 1991, he worked as Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. And, he served as a summer law clerk from May to August in 1992 and 1993 at Columbus Community Legal Services in Washington, DC.

After law school, Desmond clerked for Judge Ronald S. W. Lew of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles from August 1994 to August 1995. After his clerkship, he worked at the U.S. Department of Justice from 1995 to 2000 as a trial attorney in the Tax Division. From 2000 to 2004, he worked at Bingham McCutchen LLP and its predecessor firm, McKee Nelson LLP. In 2005, he served as Tax Legislative Counsel at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Tax Policy. In 2007, he started teaching at Georgetown University Law Center as an adjunct professor of law. In 2008, Desmond returned to work at Bingham McCutchen LLP. In 2012, he left Bingham McCutchen LLP to start his own law practice in Santa Barbara, California. On March 6, 2018, Desmond was nominated to the position of IRS Chief Counsel and Assistant General Counsel, U.S. Department of the Treasury. He dissolved his professional corporation on August 10, 2018.

In support of Michael Desmond's nomination, the Tax Executives Institute (a global membership organization with more than 7,000 members who work for over 3,200 companies) submitted a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance expressing its "unqualified support" urging his swift confirmation. The Federal Bar Association's Section on Taxation submitted a letter to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance to express its support for Michael Desmond to the position of Chief Counsel of the IRS urging the Committee to "approve his nomination swiftly." And, in a letter submitted to the Senate Finance Committee, 10 former IRS Chief Counsels or Acting Chief Counsels applauded the nomination of Michael Desmond and recommended "that he be confirmed as quickly as possible." In the past he served as a tax advisor to the Trump Organization. President Trump reportedly asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in early 2019 to ensure that Desmond was confirmed quickly. The request roughly coincided with a push by members of the new Democratic Party majority in Congress to request Trump's tax returns.
