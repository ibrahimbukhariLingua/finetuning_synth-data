# Tramwaje Śląskie



**Tramwaje Śląskie** — Poland company (joint stock company) engaged in the operation of tramway transportation in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region and maintenance of tramway infrastructure.

The company was established on January 1, 2003, as a state-owned company, as a result of the transformation of the state-owned *Tramway Transportation Enterprise in Katowice*.

On May 30, 2007, the company's shares were transferred free of charge to the *Komunikacyjny Związek Komunalny Górnośląskiego Okręgu Przemysłowego* (Communal Transport Union of the Upper Silesian Industrial Region), and from there to interested municipalities of the Upper Silesian conurbation, thus ending the long-standing municipalization process.
