## History

The National Bank of Georgia was established on the basis of the Georgian Republican Bank of the State Bank of the USSR in 1991.

Georgia's first central bank was established in 1919. Its first manager was Yason Lordkipanidze, who headed the bank from 1919 to 1924. In 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the regulator began to function as an independent institution. Then, by decision of the Supreme Council of Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia was established on the basis of the Soviet financial and credit structure.
