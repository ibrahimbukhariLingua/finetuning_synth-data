## Career


### ShoreBank

Hasten joined ShoreBank as CEO in May 2007. Soon after, Hasten and ShoreBank mounted an effort to offer mortgage refinancing to many of the 10,000 South Side, Chicago homeowners identified by ShoreBank as being at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. Named the Rescue Loan Program, ShoreBanks efforts were at the forefront of the subprime mortgage crisis and became a model for helping homeowners at the highest risk of default due to predatory loans by offering them a chance to refinance into fixed mortgages at reasonable rates. The program attracted national attention and was profiled on The News Hour with Jim Lehrer and the Nightly Business Report on PBS. And Fast Company and the Monitor Group awarded a 2007 Social Capitalist Award and named ShoreBank one of 45 Social Entrepreneurs Who Are Changing the World in 2008.
