The bank was founded by Compagnia di San Paolo (a brotherhood) in 1563. In early years the bank was a mount of piety. By the late 19th-century, it was state-controlled.⁸⁹

In 1991 Crediop became a subsidiary of the bank, which was sold to Dexia in 1999 by Sanpaolo IMI, the successor of the bank.

In 1991, due to Legge Amato [it], the bank was transformed from a statutory corporation to a società per azioni (company limited by shares), which **San Paolo Bank Holding S.p.A.** and **Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino S.p.A.** were created. Compagnia di San Paolo remained as the major shareholders. In 1997 the brotherhood owned 20.54% of the bank, followed by Banco Santander (6.8%), Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (5%) and others.

In 1994 the bank absorbed Banca Provinciale Lombarda and Banco Lariano. In 1995 Sanpaolo absorbed Banca Nazionale delle Comunicazioni.

According to Ricerche e Studi, a subsidiary of Mediobanca, the bank was ranked second in terms of client deposits in 1997, behind Banca Intesa (pro forma data). In 1998 the bank merged with Istituto Mobiliare Italiano to form Sanpaolo IMI.
