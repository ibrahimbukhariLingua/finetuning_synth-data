The **Department for Enterprise** (*Rheynn Gastid Dellal*) is one of eight departments of the Isle of Man Government. It was created on 1 April 2010 as the Department for Economic Development, largely replacing the former Department of Trade and Industry as well as taking on the tourism function from the former Department of Tourism and Leisure and several other functions from the Isle of Man Treasury and the former Department of Education.

The department was renamed as the Department for Enterprise in November 2017 under Statutory Document No. 2017/0325.

The current (in 2022) Minister for Enterprise is Tim Johnston MHK.
