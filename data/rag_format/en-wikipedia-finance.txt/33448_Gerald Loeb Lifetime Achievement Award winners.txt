Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award winners


# Gerald Loeb Lifetime Achievement Award winners



The Gerald Loeb Award is given annually for multiple categories of business reporting. Lifetime Achievement awards are given annually "to honor a journalist whose career has exemplified the consistent and superior insight and professional skills necessary to contribute to the public's understanding of business, finance and economic issues." Recipients are given a hand-cut crystal Waterford globe "symbolic of the qualities honored by the Loeb Awards program: integrity, illumination, originality, clarity and coherence." The first Lifetime Achievement Award was given in 1992.
