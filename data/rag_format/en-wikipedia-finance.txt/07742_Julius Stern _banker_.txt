# Julius Stern (banker)



**Julius Bernhard Stern** (born 26 July 1858 in Hamburg; died 23 March 1914 in Berlin) was a German Jewish banker, art collector and philanthropist.


## Life

Julius Stern was born in Hamburg in 1858, the son of Moritz Stern (1807-1887) et Mathilde Sterna (1829-1886). He became a director of the National Bank for Germany in 1883 at the age of 24. He held this position until his death in 1914. He also held numerous supervisory board positions, including at the Dresdner Bank and the arms manufacturer Ludwig Loewe & Co.

Julius Stern was married to Malgonia Karpeles (1871-1914). The couple lived at 6a Bellevuestraße in Berlin's upmarket Tiergarten district. From 1912, the Sterns had a country house built for them by Paul Baumgarten in Geltow near Potsdam. Baumgarten had previously built villas on Berlin's Wannsee, including the Liebermann Villa. The architect and designer Henry van de Velde created part of the interior design for both the Berlin flat and the Stern villa in Geltow. The Stern couple moved in an artistic environment. Malgonia Stern was a pupil of the painter Dora Hitz, the writer Otto Julius Bierbaum dedicated a poem to her and the sculptor Georg Kolbe created a portrait bust of her. Julius Stern had himself portrayed several times by the painter Max Liebermann (painting in the Kunstmuseum Gelsenkirchen, painting study in private ownership, pastel painting in the Museum Ostwall in Dortmund). The Sterns' circle of friends included the art historian Julius Meier-Graefe, the Berlin Secession painters Leo von König and Eugene Spiro, and Spiro's wife, the actress Tilla Durieux.

Julius Stern was a member of the Verein für deutsche Volkskunde. As a patron of the arts, he supported young artists, promoted the art critic Karl Scheffler and was a patron of the Berlin National Gallery, to which he donated the portrait of a little girl by Dora Hitz in 1897. In 1912, together with other art lovers, he acquired the drawing estate of the architect and designer Joseph Maria Olbrich, which went as a foundation to the Berlin Museum of Decorative Arts and the Art Library of the National Museums in Berlin. The Kupferstichkabinett Berlin received five etchings and twelve lithographs by Max Liebermann from Stern in 1911. In 1912, etchings by Rudolf Großmann, Hans Meid and Waldemar Rösler followed as a further gift.

## Death and legacy

Julius Stern died on 23 March 1914 at the age of 56 during a conference at the National Bank. His coffin was laid out in front of his picture gallery and dignatories from the world of finance, commerce, politics as well as art and science attended his funeral, including the Vice-President of the German Reichstag. Max Liebermann delivered the eulogy. After speeches by the art historian Julius Meier-Graefe (1867-1935) and the architect Henry van de Velde (1863-1957), Stern was buried in the Jewish cemetery

His widow, Malgonia lent the Stern collection to the first exhibition of the Freie Secession, at Kurfürstendamm from 11 April 1914. She committed suicide on 20 May 1914, leaving behind their fifteen year old son. After the death of Julius Stern and his wife Malgonia, the estate was auctioned at the Cassirer auction house in 1916. In addition to the art collection, this also included European and Asian arts and crafts.

The Sterns were Jewish and Julius' and Malgonia's son Werner Otto Stern (1899-1942) was murdered at the Nazi concentration camp of Sobibor in Poland.
