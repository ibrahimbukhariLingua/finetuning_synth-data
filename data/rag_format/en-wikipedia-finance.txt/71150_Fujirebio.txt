Fujirebio was founded in Tokyo, Japan in 1950 under the name Fujizoki Pharmaceutical, Co., Inc. In its early days the company developed and manufactured pharmaceutical products. The company's first IVD test was launched in 1966, a TPHA kit for syphilis testing. In 1983 the company changed name to Fujirebio Inc. Between 1998 and 2010 Fujirebio acquired several specialized IVD companies, notably Centocor Diagnostics (1998), CanAg Diagnostics (2006) and Innogenetics (2010). In 2005, Fujirebio Inc. was integrated together with the commercial laboratories SRL, Inc. ("Special Reference Laboratories", established in 1970) under the holding company Miraca Holdings Inc. (which was renamed to H.U. Group Holdings, Inc. in 2020). The current company structure, Fujirebio Holdings, Inc. was created in 2017 as a parent company of Fujirebio Inc., Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc., Fujirebio Europe N.V. and other Fujirebio group companies.
