### Closure of *BusinessWeek* Russian version in 2008

Three years after the Russian version of BusinessWeek magazine went on sale in Russia, the *Rodionov Publishing House* decided to close the project, saying the journal format was not popular on the domestic market.
BusinessWeek spokesperson Patricia A. Strauss said the magazine would evaluate other projects for the Russian market. The license agreement expired on 30 June 2008.

Yevgeny Dodolev, publishing director of the Rodionov Publishing House's business publications group, said the BusinessWeek format had never been popular with the Russian market. "We have decided to close the unprofitable magazine because there is no advertising; and the project has not recouped itself," Dodolev told the paper. He said there were no profitable U.S. weekly magazines in Russia. Although our publishing house has invested over $10 million in the magazine since 2005, the project has not even reached breakeven point, Dodolev said. TNS Gallup AdFact managing director Ruslan Tagiyev said there were already 15 weeklies on the stagnant local market. He said BusinessWeek was among the last to enter the market and found it difficult to promote itself.

The Russian team proved unable to combine the Western brand and the needs of Russian readers. Top managers at media companies with major assets, such as Independent *Media Sanoma Magazines*, Kommersant, RosBusinessConsulting, United Media, Seven Days and Media-3, said they had not interest in buying BusinessWeek's license."ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
