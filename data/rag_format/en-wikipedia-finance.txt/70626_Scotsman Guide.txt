Scotsman Guide


# Scotsman Guide



***Scotsman Guide*** is the name of two United States trade/B2B magazines published monthly by Scotsman Guide Media in Bothell, Washington. One magazine is geared to U.S. residential mortgage originators, and one is geared to U.S. commercial mortgage originators.


## History and profile

The *Scotsman Guide* was founded in 1985. It publishes an annual ranking of the top mortgage originators in the U.S. The rankings are broken out by volume of loans and types of mortgage - for example, top lenders of Federal Housing Authority-backed loans. Mortgage lenders are invited to submit performance data to *Scotsman Guide*. *Scotsman Guide* staff audit each submission to ensure accuracy.

In mid-2014, *Scotsman Guide* launched a news service to offer original news reporting on the housing market, commercial lending and construction, government regulations, and other pertinent industry topics.

Neither publication is related to *The Scotsman* newspaper and The Scotsman Publications Ltd.


## Awards

In 2007, *Scotsman Guide* won the Maggie award of the Western Publications Association for Best Single Editorial Illustration/Trade.

In 2006 and 2007, it received a Bronze Medal from the American Society of Business Publication Editors for their Wholesale Mortgage Lenders Search database.
