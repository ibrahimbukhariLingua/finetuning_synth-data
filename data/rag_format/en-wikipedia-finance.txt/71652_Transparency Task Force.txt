Transparency Task Force


# Transparency Task Force



The **Transparency Task Force** or 'TTF' is the collaborative, campaigning community, dedicated to driving up the levels of transparency in the global financial services industry and to rid the financial industry of its short term profit mindset.

The TTF was founded in 2015 by former financial industry insider turned campaigner Andy Agathangelou who claims to have witnessed numerous things that led him to believe the industry is "pre-disposed to misbehave if it's given the chance".


## Mission

The overall mission of the Transparency Task Force is to help consumers of financial services and products to get a fair deal; and in so doing to help rebuild trust and confidence in the financial services sector.


## Successes

Following parliamentary hearings and meetings with United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, TTF was appointed as the Secretariat of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Pensions Scams.
