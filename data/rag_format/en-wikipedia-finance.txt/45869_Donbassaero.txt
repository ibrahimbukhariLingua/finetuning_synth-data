Donbassaero


# Donbassaero



**Donbassaero** (Ukrainian: Донбасаеро, Russian: Донбассаэро) was an airline with its head office on the property of Donetsk International Airport in Donetsk, Ukraine. It operated domestic and international scheduled services. Its main bases were Donetsk International Airport and Boryspil International Airport in Kyiv. The main shareholder of the company was PrivatBank, controlled by Ihor Kolomoyskyi.


## History

The airline was founded in 1993 as **Donetsk State Airline**, then re-organized and re-branded as **Donbassaero** in 2003. Their website was launched in July 2005 and their online booking system started in November of the same year.

Since 25 March 2012, as a result of the Anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine's decision to allow the consolidation of the Ukrainian Aviation Group's physical and operational assets, Donbassaero no longer operated flights with its own code, but rather on behalf of its parent company Aerosvit.

The airline filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations on 14 January 2013.
