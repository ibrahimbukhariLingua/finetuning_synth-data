## Innovations

### Dbayeh

In 1979 ABC opened what it claims to be the first true modern department store in the Middle East, in Dbayeh, a city on the Mediterranean Sea between Beirut and Jounieh. It was 15,490 m² (166,700 sq ft) in size. In 2009 it was expanded to a size of 44,250 m² (476,300 sq ft). At that time New York firm nARCHITECTS designed, based on the company's logo, a laser cut aluminum screen enveloping the 200,000 sq ft (19,000 m²) existing building, and inverse cut-outs to adorn the facades of the 250,000 sq ft (23,000 m²) addition.


### Achrafieh

In 2003, ABC opened its 126,500 m² (1,362,000 sq ft) flagship shopping center including a 13,500 m² (145,000 sq ft) ABC department store within it, the first international-standard open-air mall in Lebanon, in the upmarket central Achrafieh neighborhood.

In 2017, agency KKD completed a redesign of the department store's interior.

In November 2023 during the Gaza war, ABC Achrafieh was at the center of a controversy where it was claimed that the Palestinian keffiyeh was banned at the mall after an employee was told to remove their keffiyeh during work hours. It was also claimed that merchandise related to Palestine was removed. ABC later confirmed that the management did ask an employee to remove her keffiyeh due to the dress code for employees that bans religious and partisan symbols, but also said that customers are free to wear what they want, and said that they have no problem if one of their stores wants to sell merchandise related to Palestine.


### Verdun

In 2017, ABC opened its third mall in Verdun, southern Beirut, 155,500 m² (1,674,000 sq ft) in size. ABC Verdun is home to 200 shops and a 10,800 m² (116,000 sq ft) ABC Department Store. It measures 150,000 m² (1,600,000 sq ft) and was developed on an ex-property of the Church in a joint venture with Bahaa Hariri, the Group of one of the sons of ex-Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafic Hariri, murdered in 2005, whose other son Saad Hariri also served as Prime Minister. ABC Group holds 40% of the capital and operates the mall.

The architectural design by Seattle-based CalissonRTKL is adapted to the climate, which avoids having to air-condition or heat the common areas: a large canopy houses the roof terrace where the restaurants and the garden are located. Below, the corridors are protected from rain but the air circulates and is refreshed naturally.


### Other stores

Other former ABC stores that are now closed include ABC at Bab Idriss Square (opened 1936), ABC Bab Borj (opened 1940), ABC Hamra (opened 1948, now an outlet store), ABC Zahlé (opened 1973, now an outlet store), ABC Kaslik (opened 1978) and ABC Furn El Chebbak (opened 1994).

ABC also operates 3 outlet stores: Tripoli (Lebanon), Zahlé, and in Beirut in the Hamra district. It operates standalone boutiques in its malls for three brands: Calvin Klein, Ted Baker and Tommy Hilfiger.

In 2020 ABC launched an e-commerce site.
