### Senior Fellows

M-RCBG Senior Fellows contribute to understanding the evolving relationship between business and government. They are professionals from government and/or business who come to M-RCBG to address issues at the interface of the public and private sectors: regulation, corporate governance, and the role of government in the changing global economy. Senior fellows undertake independent research projects that culminate in a working paper, a journal article or, in rare cases, a book. They also offer study groups for Harvard students.

Every senior fellow is sponsored by a Harvard Kennedy School faculty member, and a committee of M-RCBG-affiliated faculty reviews applications, recommends fellows appointments and assigns faculty sponsors.


### Grossman Fellowship

The Jerome H. Grossman M.D. Graduate Fellowship honors Dr. Jerome H. Grossman, whose career focused on strengthening health care delivery in the United States.
