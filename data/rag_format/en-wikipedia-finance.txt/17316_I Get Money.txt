I Get Money


# I Get Money



"**I Get Money**" is the third single from 50 Cent's third album, *Curtis*. This song was #14 on *Rolling Stone*'s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. The song peaked at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified Gold by the RIAA.


## Production

"I Get Money" contains elements from Audio Two's "Top Billin'". It was recorded at 50 Cent's Connecticut mansion studio by engineer Alonzo Vargas. Although the track was a promotional single, it was also the official remix for 50 Cent's previous single, "Straight to the Bank". The song was produced by Apex. Initially, Scott Boogie was credited as the producer of the song: however, it was later discovered that Scott Boogie actually stole the beat from Apex. In the song, 50 Cent talks about the Glacéau acquisition by The Coca-Cola Company (as he had an ownership stake in Glacéau's parent company); he raps:

> I took quarter water, sold it in bottles for two bucks. Coca-Cola came and bought it for billions, what the fuck?


## Critical reception

Whilst reviews for *Curtis* were generally mixed, "I Get Money" received acclaim from most music critics. Several named it as a standout track from the album, many of whom praised the production by Apex. *RapReviews.com* writer Arthur Gailes described it as an example of "whenever the production is on [on *Curtis*], [how] it breathes an even greater life into 50", and also praised the lyrics, writing that "50's swagger and wit work together for an instant hit". In an otherwise negative review for *Curtis*, *Stylus Magazine* reviewer Jayson Greene described the song as a "club hit" and felt the song to be the best on the album, stating it to be a "single blip of life on an otherwise completely flat line". David Jefferies of *Allmusic* praised the song in comparison to 50 Cent's past material, stating it to be "a classic "I Run New York" swagger-fest in the G-Unit style", and wrote that it contained one of three "inspired" and "killer verses" on the album. In his review of *Curtis*, *Sputnikmusic* writer Dave Donnelly described "I Get Money" as a "surprise" when compared to his feeling of *Curtis* as "inconsistent", and felt the song to be superior to the song "I Get Money was recorded as the official remix to, "Straight to the Bank". the. He also praised Apex's production and the use of the "Top Billin" sample, writing that "Not only does Apex’s version outclass the original, but the clever use of outside samples (including Audio Two’s ‘Top Billin’’) lends the track a power and urgency he’s all but lost in the past few years and gives rise to the quickly-dashed prospect that he could actually take his music in a new and exciting direction."

Whilst describing the music on *Curtis* generally to be "monotonous", *Pitchfork Media* writer Ryan Dombal praised "I Get Money", writing that "*Curtis* nails this sweet-spot only once, on the stadium-status "I Get Money"." He also described the song as "raw and excitable", calling it "an adrenaline rush so pure it manages to revive 50's weary id for three and a half booming minutes". In his review of *Curtis* for *PopMatters*, Josh Timmermann wrote highly of the song, calling it "the collection's clear MVP... arguably the hip-hop single of the year and 50's strongest track in years". He also praised the attitude and tone exhibited by 50 Cent on the record, writing "In its irresistible arrogance and amoral brand of gallows humor (both foremost among 50’s virtues), it’s reminiscent of his reputation-making breakthrough, "How to Rob"". He also went on to praise the lyrics, in particular praising the line "I write the check before the baby comes / who the fuck cares? / I’m stanky rich / I’m a die tryin’ to spend this shit". He felt these words represented "50 at his charismatic, self-aggrandizing best" and also wrote "Dominance is his great theme, and, to be sure, one of contemporary rap's. Rarely, among his recent output (and rap's, for that matter), has it been strutted out as convincingly as it is here". *Time* magazine named "I Get Money" one of "The 10 Best Songs of 2007", ranking it at number six: writer Josh Tyrangiel praised the song as “hypnotic”, observing that its appeal is owed to the sample of "Top Billin", a song he wrote to be "best described as the sound of bad things about to happen". He also commented that "50 Cent’s bemusement - at his own survival, his success in the fact that you could possibly care what he has to say - makes the song as wry as it is scary." In their list of "The 100 Best Songs of 2007", *Rolling Stone* listed "I Get Money" at number fourteen, writing that "this over-the-top celebration of stanky richness was one of the strongest radio hits of 2007, thanks to its grinding beat, nickel-plated hooks and 50's pile-driving rhymes".
