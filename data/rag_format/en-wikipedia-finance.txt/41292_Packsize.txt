## Business model

Packsize established Right-sized Packaging on Demand as its business model. Through this model, Packsize retains ownership of its technology giving the company a long-term stake in its customers’ packaging performance as well as continued revenue. p . T

Packsize’s Right-sized Packaging on Demand business model includes using its On Demand Packaging system. Packsize coined the term On Demand Packaging to identify and distinguish its unique system from typical box systems. The On Demand Packaging system eliminates the need for large inventories of pre-ordered cardboard boxes and minimizes the amount of packaging filler needed, if any. Packsize’s On Demand Packaging system includes a box-making machine, software and corrugated material. Product dimensions are entered into the box-making machine. The machine cuts, creases and scores the corrugated material to the exact specifications to create a customized box specifically optimized for the product. As a result, less packaging material and void fill are required to safely package items. The On Demand Packaging system also reduces the space required for packaging material inventory and shipping costs.
