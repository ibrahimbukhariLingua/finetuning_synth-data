## History

The earliest Manx bank began business in 1802 at Bridge House, Castletown. Formed by George Quayle, Mark Quayle, John Taubman and James Kelly, it was also known as the Isle of Man Bank. The company carried on trading until 1818.

Founded by Samuel Harris, Henry Noble, William Moore and William Callister, the Isle of Man Banking Co. Ltd. was established at Athol Street, Douglas, on 26 October 1865. It was the first limited liability company enrolled on the register following the passage of the Companies Act 1865. The bank was acquired by National Provincial Bank in 1961 and became a subsidiary of National Westminster Bank upon the merger of National Provincial with Westminster Bank in 1968, joining the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in 2000, when NatWest was acquired by the smaller Scottish bank. RBS Group was renamed NatWest Group in 2020.

On 21 May 2019, the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man granted approval to transfer the business and undertakings of Isle of Man Bank Limited to the Isle of Man branch of The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited (trading as Isle of Man Bank); these changes came into effect on 28 May 2019.
