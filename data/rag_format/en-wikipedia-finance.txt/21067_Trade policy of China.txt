Trade policy of China


# Trade policy of China



China is the world's largest exporter, a position it has maintained continuously since 2010. It is the largest trading partner of over 120 countries, as of at least early 2024. As a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), China is part of the world's largest trading bloc.

China began promoting overseas investment through the Go Out policy, which Jiang Zemin formally announced as a national strategy in 2000. After its 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, China focused on export-led growth and became a major link in global supply chains. Through this process, China developed large trade surpluses and foreign currency reserves.


## History

In 1999, the Chinese government began promoting investment abroad through the Go Out policy and Jiang Zemin formally announced it as a national strategy in March 2000.⁵⁶ The policy was implemented top-down from central government leadership.¹²³ During Jiang's tenure, the policy greatly expanded China's investment and influence in global South countries, especially those in Africa and Asia.¹²⁴

After its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, China began pursuing export-led growth and became a key link in global supply chains.²³⁵–²³⁶ China formed the policy-based insurer Sinosure to support the exports and overseas business of domestic companies.⁷⁷–⁷⁸ Chinese businesses were encouraged to trade directly with foreign companies (instead of working through SOEs as previously). with the exception of certain state monopoly sectors deemed critical to national security.³⁹ China's industrious and cheap labor also proved attractive to foreign investments.²³⁵–²³⁶ China's share of the global trade surplus increased rapidly after it joined the WTO.²⁷⁴ The country accumulated large trade surpluses and foreign currency reserves, which greatly increased government resources.²³⁵–²³⁶

China resumed status as a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1987.¹⁶³

During Jiang Zemin's tenure, China adopted policies to expand foreign trade and economic relations with other countries through the Maritime Commerce Law (1993), Anti-Subsidy Rules (1997), and 2001 revisions to the Foreign Investment Law.¹⁹⁰

In 2016, China joined the Transports Internationaux Routiers Convention (TIR Convention), a multilateral treaty reducing administrative boundaries for international transportations of goods in customs-sealed containers.¹⁴⁹ The majority of TIR members also participate in China's Belt and Road Initiative and membership significantly facilitates China's trade.¹⁴⁹

China is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).¹⁴⁸ RCEP is the first trade agreement to include all three of China, Japan, and South Korea.¹⁷⁶ In January 2022, RCEP became the world's largest trade bloc (in economic terms) and continues to be the world's largest as of at least early 2024.¹⁴⁸

China provides foreign aid to advance both foreign trade objectives and foreign policy objectives.¹⁸ Since the 2018 creation of the China International Development Cooperation Agency to coordinate aid, China has placed a lesser emphasis on aid to advance foreign trade and a greater emphasis on aid to advance foreign policy.¹⁸

In 2020, China signed major free trade agreements with the European Union as well as fifteen different Asia-Pacific countries.²⁵⁹ As of at least 2023, China is the world's largest exporter, a status it has maintained continuously since 2010.⁸⁸

Effective 1 December 2024, China eliminated tariffs for goods imported from all of the countries that the United Nations categorizes as least developed and with which China has diplomatic relations. Thirty-three of the countries benefiting from the agreement are in Africa and the non-African countries receiving zero tariff treatment are Yemen, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, and East Timor.


## Impact

As of at least early 2024, China is the largest trading partner of over 120 countries.¹⁴⁷ Given the scale of China and its economy, the country's impact on international trade flow is major.²⁷² As of at least 2024, the global current account surplus is largely composed of China, Europe, and the Middle East.²⁷⁴
