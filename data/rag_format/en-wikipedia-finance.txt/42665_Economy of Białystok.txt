Economy of Białystok


# Economy of Białystok



In the 19th century Białystok was an important center for light industry and was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the 20th century, such as *Fasty* in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.

The unemployment rate for February 2011 in Białystok was 13.2%. The 2009 average household had a monthly per capita income of 1018.77 zł and monthly per capita expenses of 823.56 zł


## History

At that time, there were 219 industrial plants in the city employing 6,970 workers. Most of them (129) were textile companies. Before World War I, the factories were producing at full steam. The retreating Russians dismantled and took away machines and materials, and destroyed what they did not have time or could not take away. What is worse, Białystok entrepreneurs lost all their capital deposited in Russian banks. In addition, they were cut off from raw material resources and - very importantly - access to the absorbent Russian sales market. After these events, Białystok industry never returned to its former glory.

The interwar period was a very difficult time for the Białystok industry. Short periods of stabilization alternated with crises. At the beginning of the Second Polish Republic, thanks to state orders for uniforms for the new army, it was possible to partially rebuild the textile industry. However, Białystok factories were at a low technical level: manufacturers assembled machines on their own, often making missing parts. Therefore, the factories produced poor quality products: the cheapest cloth and blankets from the worst raw materials. In 1921, the Association of Białystok Large Industry was established. The favorable economic situation ended in 1924 after Stanisław Grabski's currency reform and in 1925, 90% of Białystok textile workers were unemployed. The Białystok industry had finally recovered from the effects of the crisis of the mid-1920s, and the great crisis of 1928-1933 came. It caused another wave of bankruptcies. This fate befell, among others, the well-known plywood factory belonging to Artur Hasbach. In 1938, there were 212 industrial plants in the city, of which 101 represented the textile industry. In the interwar years, even in the period of the greatest production, the Białystok textile industry did not exceed 70% of the state from 1914. New factories, despite the passage of time, did not match the old ones and lost the competition with Łódź. Although Białystok was an industrial city and the largest centre in north-eastern Poland, its occupational structure resembled that of neglected borderland towns and it had a large share of small craftsmen and shopkeepers.
