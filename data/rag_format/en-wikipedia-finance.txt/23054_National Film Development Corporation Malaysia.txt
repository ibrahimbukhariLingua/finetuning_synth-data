# National Film Development Corporation Malaysia



The **National Film Development Corporation Malaysia** (Malay: *Perbadanan Kemajuan Filem Nasional Malaysia*), abbreviated **FINAS**, is the central government agency and governing body for the film industry of Malaysia. Its role is to regulate economic and commercial matters related to the film industry in Malaysia and responsible for film policies and programs to ensure the economic, cultural and educational development of the Malaysian film industry as well as providing funds to filmmakers and film studios. FINAS is similar to the Film Development Council of the Philippines in the Philippines and Motion Picture Association of America in the United States. Following its merger with Filem Negara Malaysia (FNM) in 2013 to form a sole film body, FINAS operated as an independent statutory body separated from remuneration.


## History

Malaysian film authority was split into two separate bodies in 1980 â€“ namely Filem Negara Malaysia and the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia. Prior to 2013, both film agencies have different respective roles, with FINAS focused on financial, commercial and economic matters while Filem Negara Malaysia focused on production, documentation and technical aspects.

The National Film Development Corporation (FINAS) is the result of a decision made by the National Film Development Committee set up by the Malaysian government on 26 July 1980 to devise ways to develop a film company in Malaysia. The result of the National Film Development Committee's National Film Development Corporation was set up on 1 June 1981, and started operation in Jalan Ampang then moved to Studio Merdeka Complex, Hulu Kelang on 19 December 1988, when Tan Sri Abdul Samad Idris was the chairman of Finas.

Starting from 27 December 2004, FINAS was later placed under the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage of Malaysia and was the agency of the Ministry of Arts and Heritage Culture Unity beginning in 2008. From April 2008, FINAS was placed under the Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture.

FINAS is involved in the promotion of filming in Malaysia, and with the implementation of the Investors Promotion Act, 1986 also censured local film and video production activities. Finas also established the Film Academy in 1987, aimed at providing short term formal training, certificate and diploma levels to employees interested in film production. In addition, local filmmakers also enjoy the government's financial incentives under the Entertainment Grants Scheme.

To encourage filmmaking in Malaysia, FINAS also provided assistance in the form of loan facilities and rental of shooting equipment as well as film production facilities, preview halls and studios. The government also assisted local filmmakers by offering 50% off government television advertisements by the Ministry of Information. The government has also enforced the Compulsory Terms from January 1991 in the effort to develop the Malaysian film industry administered by Finas.

On 10 April 2019, actor and producer Hans Isaac served as the Chairman of FINAS, succeeding Samsuni Mohd Nor. He resigned from his position on 22 May 2020 and was taken over by Zakaria Abdul Hamid, a day later, on 23 May.

On 23 July 2020, the Communications and Multimedia Ministry announced that it would impose licensing on all video recording in Malaysia, which included social media posts. This was revoked 2 days later, on 25 July 2020.
