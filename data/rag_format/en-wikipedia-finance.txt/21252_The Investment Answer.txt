3. The diversification decision
4. The active vs. passive decision
5. The rebalancing decision

The book is a general guide to investment and gives fundamental explanations in each chapter. The first chapter deals with using brokers. Chapter two touches on asset allocation, explaining the relationship between risk and return. Chapter three gives a basic explanation of diversification (having a mix of assets in a portfolio). Chapter four discusses *active investing* versus *passive investing*. Chapter five is about rebalancing a portfolio. Chapter six discusses how to gauge the performance of a portfolio. Chapter seven touches on hedge funds, private equity and commodities.


## Key principles of the book

1. The global capitalist system generates a positive return on capital over time.
2. Investing broadly and cheaply in global capital markets with asset class funds and index funds is a winning strategy over the long term because global capital market returns are available to everyone overall.
3. With a proper time horizon and discipline, investors can capture global capital market returns which should beat most active investors (who try to beat the market) with less risk.
4. The most effective and efficient way to invest in stocks and bonds is in public equity and debt markets.
5. Stock picking and market timing are *speculation*, while asset allocation, broad diversification of portfolio risk, reducing costs and staying the course are *investing*.
