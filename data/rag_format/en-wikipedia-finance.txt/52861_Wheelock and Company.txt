## History

G.E. Marden founded Marden and Company in 1925 and merged with Wheelock's tug company to form Wheelock and Marden Company Limited in 1932. The new company operated other ships and later moved their operations to Hong Kong following World War II. The new company diversified from transportation to custom's clearing, container delivery, warehousing and travelling. Marden's son John L. Marden was once the head of the company.
