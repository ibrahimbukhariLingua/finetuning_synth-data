### Independence

Roxas first appeared on the one hundred peso bill upon the release of the *Pilipino series* notes in 1967.


#### English series (1951–1974)

Features the portrait of Melchora Aquino, a Filipino revolutionary during the Philippine Revolution, who became known as "Tandang Sora". The reverse features the different flags used by the Katipunan movement.


#### Pilipino series (1969–1974)

In 1967, Manuel Roxas replaced the portrait of Melchora Aquino. The note is now predominantly violet in color. On the reverse, it now features the Central Bank of the Philippines main office before they were relocated to their current complex in Manila. The design of the obverse was later revised, the "100" on the lower right corner was moved higher, in turn placed the Central Bank logo below it, the signature of the Central Bank Governor was placed beside the signature of the President of the Philippines, the font for *Republika ng Pilipinas* and all of the "100" text were also changed and the text *Sandaang Piso* was made into one line. Geometric lines were also added on the sides and the watermark area of the note. This design was later used when the Bagong Lipunan series was released in 1973.


#### Ang Bagong Lipunan series (1973–1996)

In 1976, the "Ang Bagong Lipunan" text was added and was overprinted on the watermark area.

In 1978, the reverse was changed to reflect the Central Bank's transfer to its new complex in Manila.


#### New Design series (1987–2018)

In 1987, the note was completely redesigned and new elements regarding Roxas' tenure as the first president of the independent republic was shown on the lower right side where the Philippine flag was raised while the flag of the United States was lowered on July 4, 1946. The banknote was designed by Angel Cacnio.

After the creation of the "Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas" in 1993, its new logo was incorporated on all the New Design series bills.

In 1998, the year of printing was added at the bottom of the denomination value located at the upper left corner of the obverse. The names of the signatories on the bills were later added starting with banknotes featuring the signature of President Joseph Estrada.

Starting with banknotes featuring the signature of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2001, additional security features were added: the security thread on the right side and the gold fluorescent printing on the left side across the portrait.

On banknotes with the signatures of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and BSP Governor Amando Tetangco Jr. from 2005 to 2010, there are two variants where the signatories are wide and narrow. The wider and lighter version (similar to Arroyo and Rafael Buenaventura signature combination from 2001 to 2004) is used on banknotes issued on 2005 and some in 2008, while the narrower and bolder one is used on notes from 2006 to 2010. The latter is also used on most banknotes issued in 2008.


#### New Generation series (2010–present)

In 2010, the portrait of Manuel A. Roxas was redesigned, a picture of the old Central Bank building and the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines were added on the lower left corner and bottom center of the bill respectively. The reverse now features the Mayon Volcano and the whale shark.

In 2016, the color of the note was modified to have a stronger mauve or violet color. It was issued to address complaints that the color of the 100 peso note is almost indistinguishable with the 1000 peso note.

In 2017, an updated version of the *New Generation* series 100 piso banknote was issued with changes in the font size of the year of issue and the italicization of the scientific name on the reverse side.

In 2020, an enhanced version of the 100 peso banknote was released. It added color-changing indigenous patterns to the security threads. Also, four tactile marks were placed for the elderly and the visually impaired, two pairs on both the extreme left and right side of the front of the note.

The new BSP logo, which was redesigned in January 2021 was adopted in all NGC banknotes starting with the 2022 issued banknotes featuring the signatures of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and BSP Governor Felipe Medalla.

## Design errors

The banknote became the subject of controversy in 2005 after banknotes printed by Oberthur Technologies of France in time for the Christmas season were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history. The banknotes spelled the President's name as "*Gloria Macapagal-Arrovo*" versus the correct Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.

In December 2017, a 100 peso banknote which had no face of Manuel A. Roxas and no electrotype 100 was issued. The Facebook post was shared over 24,000 times. The BSP said that the banknotes are due to a rare misprint.
