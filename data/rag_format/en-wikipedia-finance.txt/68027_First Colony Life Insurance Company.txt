# First Colony Life Insurance Company



**First Colony Life** (FCL) was an American life insurance company based in Lynchburg, Virginia that was acquired in 1996 by GE Financial Assurance (a subsidiary of General Electric), and later became Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company, a Genworth Financial company in 2007. First Colony Life was one of the first life insurance companies to market term life insurance products through the fledgling independent brokerage general agency (BGA) distribution model instead of relying upon a captive career sales force in the 1950s.
