United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission


# United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission



The **United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission** (informally, the **U.S.–China Commission**, **USCC**) is an independent commission of the United States government legislative branch. It was established on October 30, 2000, through the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act.

The USCC is responsible for providing recommendations to Congress based on their findings on bilateral trade with the People's Republic of China, evaluating national security and trading risks in all industries and conducting research on China's actions. All these findings are discussed in their hearings, and submitted in an annual report or other published research throughout the year.

The USCC directly reports to Congress—it is not a part of any other department or agency in the federal government. The USCC consists of 12 commissioners, a non-partisan staff, and facilities that were absorbed from the former U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission. The commissioners are appointed to two-year terms by the majority and minority leaders of the U.S. Senate, and by the speaker and minority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. The current head of the commission is Carolyn Bartholomew and the vice chairman is Robin Cleveland, who are responsible for organizing meetings with other commissioners. Each commissioner is entitled to one vote.


## History

The USCC staff and facilities are from former U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act of 2001. Since then, the USCC is responsible for overseeing trade deficit matters with China.

One reason the USCC was created was the U.S. government's belief that some of the current trades with China were in need of urgent attentions and corrections based on analyses, considering China's military modernizations, change of trade policy and media and information controls. The creation of the USCC (along with the Congressional-Executive Commission on China) was also a concession to political forces skeptical of China in order to obtain further support for permanent normal trade relations with China upon its accession to the World Trade Organization.²¹⁴

Its first annual report in 2002 found that China is and will be a major competitor of the U.S. and also concluded that China as the third-largest trading partner had extremely unbalanced trade relationship. In the following years between 2004 and 2009, the USCC stated that China's undervalued currency, counterfeiting and piracy, export subsidies and lack of protection of U.S. intellectual property rights were continually contributed to a growing trade deficit.

The main focus for the commission is constantly changing around the eight main areas. However, the focused area from 2010 to 2020 was national security.

In the 2020 annual report, the commission stated 10 keys recommendations but many of them are related to security versus purely economic-centered. The USCC argues the main direction of China–United States relations will be a "combination of containment and engagement". In its 2023 annual report, the USCC stated that "China now appears to view diplomacy with the United States primarily as a tool for forestalling and delaying U.S. pressure over a period of years while China moves ever further down the path of developing its own economic, military, and technological capabilities."

## Commentary

According to academic Stephen Roach, from 2000 to at least 2022, the commission has functioned as a high-profile forum for anti-China policy sentiments and has increased distrust towards China.²⁸⁹ Citing their creation as a political concession to China skeptics, academic David M. Lampton writes that from inception to at least 2024, the commission along with the Congressional-Executive Commission on China have functioned as perches for highly politicized appointees.²¹⁴
