## History

PMFL was founded in 1995 as a non-governmental organization with the support of the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. Its major objective was to offer credit to the poor, targeting those in the agricultural sector. In 1999, it was incorporated as a limited company and changed its name to Pride Africa Uganda Limited. The institution provides financial services to that segment of the Ugandan population who are not served or are unable to access financial services through Ugandan commercial banks. PBL's focus are the micro, small, and medium size entrepreneurs. It is therefore prohibited from dealing in foreign exchange. In 2003, the Uganda government acquired 100 percent shareholding in the enterprise, changing the name to Pride Microfinance Limited Uganda. In 2005, it attained the status of a Tier III (an MDI), according to the Banking Act of 2003.

In February 2016, Ugandan media reported that the government was planning to merge PMFL with PostBank Uganda, to form an agricultural bank.
