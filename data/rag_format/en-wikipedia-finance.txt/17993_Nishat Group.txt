## History

Nishat Group's origins goes back to a leather business in Calcutta, British India, established by Mian Muhammad Yahya. Following the partition of India in 1947, Mian Muhammad Yahya and his three brothers, Mian Hameed, Mian Rafiq, and Mian Ayub, founded Nishat Mills in Pakistan in 1951. The name "Nishat" was pre-assigned to the textile license they acquired and was not chosen by the founders.

Mian Muhammad Mansha joined the family business in 1968 after the death of his father, Mian Muhammad Yahya. By 1970, the Nishat Group had expanded to include six industrial units in West Pakistan: Nishat Corporation, Nishat Sarhad Textile, Nishat Textile Faisalabad, Nishat Chemical Industries, Nishat Poultry, and Creamy Industries Nowshera. The group also had investments in East Pakistan prior to the independence of Bangladesh, including Nishat Jute Mills, Qadiryah Textile Mills, Telgin Cotton Mills, and Chemical Industries of Pakistan. Nishat Jute Mills was acquired by the group from the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation in East Pakistan.

In 1969, the assets of the group were divided among the family members. Mian Muhammad Mansha received assets located in West Pakistan, while assets in East Pakistan were transferred to other family members, which were eventually lost after the creation of Bangladesh.

In January 1995, Nishat Group planned to issue $70 million in global depository receipts (GDRs) through ABN Amro to finance the equity portion of a $216 million greenfield project for Hercules Cement. The GDR issuance was canceled in February 1995 due to unfavorable international and local market conditions.
