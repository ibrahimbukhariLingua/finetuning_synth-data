# Georgian Airways



**Georgian Airways** (Georgian: ჯორჯიან ეარვეისი, romanized: jorjian earveisi), formerly Airzena, is the privately owned flag carrier of Georgia, with its headquarters in Tbilisi. Its main base is Tbilisi International Airport. The company filed for bankruptcy on 31 December 2021, linked to a restructuring procedure, and it has been for sale since January 2022.


## History

The airline Airzena was established in September 1993. Initially, Airzena operated charter flights to the United Arab Emirates, Italy, China, Egypt, India, and Syria, as well as a regularly scheduled flight to Vienna. The company managed to achieve recognition and retain its share in the aviation market during the economically and politically complicated period of the 1990s.

In 1999 Airzena became the flag carrier of Georgia. In August 2004, the company changed its name to *Georgian Airways.* During the first half of the 2000s, the airline's management decided to modernise the fleet, and leased two Boeing 737-500s from Hapag-Lloyd. This was the first case of a Georgian airline operating up-to-date Western equipment.


## Russian sanctions

Following what Russia perceived as anti-Russian protests in June 2019, it banned all flights to and from Georgia starting 8 July 2019. Georgian Airways flights to Moscow-Vnukovo have since been operated by Aircompany Armenia via Yerevan. The ban was revoked by Russian president Vladimir Putin on 10 May 2023 starting 15 May and Georgian Airways announced it would then resume flights to Moscow from 20 May, with the first flight arriving in Vnukovo on that day. In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky imposed sanctions against the airline on 1 July.


## Bankruptcy

Georgian Airways filed for bankruptcy on 31 December 2021, linked to restructuring proceedings, and the airline was put up for sale in January 2022. The airline is in debt of ₾125,000,000 (€52,000,000), against ₾21,000,000 in assets. The causes include the Russian flight ban since July 2019, but most of all, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the airline hard. The Georgian authorities banned international air traffic for 11 months, with the exception of a number of monthly government mandated flights for repatriation purposes (operated by Georgian Airways). Georgian Airways cut back on its fleet (such as disposing of its Embraer planes) but with the Georgian resumption of international air traffic in February 2021, it could only offer six destinations.

The insolvency plan focused on the year-round profitable routes (Amsterdam, Tel Aviv and Minsk) and a few profitable seasonal charters, while guaranteeing these flights. Georgian Airways indicated in January 2022 that it would continue to operate the flights. Currently, the airline operates more routes.


## Destinations

As of October 2024, Georgian Airways operates scheduled services from Tbilisi International Airport to destinations in the European Union, Israel and Russia, while it jointly sells (but does not operate) flights to Armenia and France.
