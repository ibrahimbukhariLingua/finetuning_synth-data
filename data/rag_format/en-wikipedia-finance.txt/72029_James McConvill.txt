### Fraser controversy

McConvill gained national attention in Australia during 2005, when editor of the *Deakin Law Review*, for agreeing to publish an article called "Rethinking the White Australia Policy" by Professor Drew Fraser. The article was withdrawn after the Sudanese community in Australia threatened to sue Deakin University. Media at the time reported concerns that the article was both racist and xenophobic.
