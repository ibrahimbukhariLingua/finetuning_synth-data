# Illinois Chamber of Commerce



The **Illinois Chamber of Commerce** is a business advocacy group representing the interests of businesses across the U.S. state of Illinois. It is not a government agency, but a non-profit membership business advocacy organization.

The Chamber is staffed with policy experts, lobbyists, and business advocates. Politically, the Chamber is pro-growth and pro-business, but is non-partisan and works across party lines to work in the interest of the entire Illinois business community. The Chamber is one of the largest broad-based business lobbying groups in Illinois which represents members from various industry sectors and revenue sizes ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 corporations.


## History

On May 27, 1919, 24 business leaders assembled in Quincy, Illinois from various locations throughout the state to deal with the issue of what they considered too much government in business and to "promote and protect the business climate in Illinois". On August 2, 1919, the Illinois Chamber was officially chartered by the Illinois Secretary of State's office, with its charter membership seeking to promote and develop Illinois, foster its abundance of natural resources, and improve its conditions so the greatest possible benefit and enjoyment could be derived by living in Illinois. At first, the Illinois Chamber and its membership pledged to "refrain from any political involvement", however, it eventually provided legislative information regularly to its members, and in 1923, an office in Springfield was opened for that very purpose. In the early years, the Illinois Chamber was a driving force behind the formation of the Illinois State Police and the establishment of an appointed Illinois State Board of Education.

The chamber's mission as the leading business organization in Illinois, the Illinois Chamber of Commerce is dedicated to advocating for a business environment that promotes economic growth, free enterprise, and economic prosperity for businesses of all sizes and across all industries.

The chamber's focus is to raise and expend funds for the purposes of financing and sponsoring, publishing, promoting and distributing research on issues important to businesses or issues and analyses of the Illinois economy and business climate; provide educational forums that facilitate the discussion and debate of policy or operational matters that impact businesses generally, business segments of the Illinois economy, or the Illinois business climate; and with other organizations, sponsor activities and research projects that are consistent with the stated purposes above.” The Illinois Chamber serves businesses large and small and works with state government leaders to educate and influence lawmakers on ways to enhance the state's economy through enacting pro-business legislation.

The Illinois Chamber has hosted many political leaders in the past, including President George W. Bush in 2008 when he addressed Illinois Chamber members and the world about the state of the economy.
