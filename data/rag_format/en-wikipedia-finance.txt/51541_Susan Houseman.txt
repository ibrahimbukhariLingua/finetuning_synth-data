# Susan Houseman



**Susan N. Houseman** (born 1956) is an American economist who is the vice president and director of research at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. She is also a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research Conference on Research on Income and Wealth, chairs the Technical Advisory Committee of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and co-directs the Labor Statistics Program at the IZA Institute of Labor Economics.


## Education

Houseman holds a bachelor of arts degree in economics and international relations from the University of Virginia and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University (1985).


## Career

Houseman began her career as a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution. She left these institutions in 1989 to join the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research of Kalamazoo, in large part because this position allowed her more time to raise her four children. Her research focuses on temporary help employment, outsourcing, and the way that these working arrangements affect workers' compensation and official measures of productivity. Her research has shown that extraordinary growth in the computer industry—not automation in other industries—is responsible for all of the unusual productivity growth in the manufacturing sector, and that declining manufacturing employment in the US is due more to trade than to automation.

During the Covid-19 recession, Houseman was a frequent commentator on layoffs and unemployment insurance programs. She also advocated the use of voluntary workshare programs to maintain relationships between workers and employers. Her research on the success of these programs in European countries was cited by the Biden presidential campaign in their plans to expand the use of such programs in the United States.
