## History

The original Hanes outlet store was housed in a room adjacent to their factory. Hanesbrands currently operates and owns around 220 Hanesbrands, Maidenform and Champion retail stores across the US. The company's flagship store is located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and opened in summer 2008. Stores range in size from 2,500 to 17,000 square feet Hanesbrands has companies in various parts of Europe and Eastern Europe, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France and Spain. Sales revenue for 2010 was $4.33 billion and gross profit was $1.41 billion.

In 2011, WikiLeaks revealed that the corporation had previously lobbied the State Department to prevent the raise of Haiti's minimum-wage to $0.61 an hour from $0.31 an hour.

On July 24, 2013, Hanesbrands agreed to acquire Maidenform for $575 million.

On July 15, 2016, Hanes acquired the Australian-based clothing and underwear and clothing company Pacific Brands

In October 2017, Hanes announced a $60 million acquisition of Norcross, GA based Alternative Apparel.

In 2018, the company opened its first brick-and-mortar Champion brand retail store in Los Angeles. Currently there are 20 Champion stores open. Hanesbrands also has companies in United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France and Spain.

In November 2019, Chief Financial Officer Barry Hytinen left the company for a position at the storage and information management services company Iron Mountain.

Hanesbrands made a statement in April 2021 that Michael Dastugue would be assuming the role of chief financial officer on May 1. The company has not had a permanent CFO since the departure of Barry Hytinen in 2019, with chief accounting officer Scott Lewis serving as the interim CFO since January 2020. Mr. Dastugue, according to analyst David Swartz of Morningstar Research Services, will be leading the company in adapting to a growing customer preference for online shopping.

In June 2024, Hanesbrands announced plans to sell the Champion brand to Authentic Brands for $1.2 billion. Also in 2024, Hanesbrands announced it would move its headquarters to the Park Building in downtown Winston-Salem and that Carolina University would take over the Oak Summit headquarters where it had been located since 1993. The company said the move "didn't stem" from the sale.

As a collegiate fan apparel supplier, Hanesbrands has partnered with several Universities including Duke University, Florida State, University of Michigan, Auburn University, and Penn State among others. In April 2024, Hanesbrands extended their partnership with Duke for a further 5 years and in May 2024, the brand announced a five-year extension of its current partnership with TCU, one of more than two dozen elite schools that have special retail partnerships with Hanesbrands.

## Controversy


### May 2022 ransomware attack

Two separate legal actions were filed in February 2023 regarding a ransomware attack in May 2022. The legal actions were combined in North Carolina on behalf of 75,000 staff members. The lawsuits claimed that the ransomware breach exposed both present and past employees to the risk of identity theft, and asserted that the company lacked sufficient safety protocols in place.

Hanesbrands offered a settlement in April 2024.


### 2024 Worker Rights Consortium Report

Hanesbrands and Gildan Activewear were implicated in a Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) report in March 2024 for failing to pay wages to employees at a Central American factory. The report highlights that Central American garment workers, who manufactured products for these companies, were illegally deprived of $2 million in compensation since the factory closed two years ago. According to the report, 831 workers at the APS factory in Ilopango, El Salvador, were unlawfully denied back wages, severance, and other benefits following the facility's closure, as confirmed by the Salvadoran Ministry of Labor.
