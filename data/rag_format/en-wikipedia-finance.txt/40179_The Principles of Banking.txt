The Principles of Banking


# The Principles of Banking



**The Principles of Banking** is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Bangladesh-born English banking practitioner and educator Moorad Choudhry and published by John Wiley & Sons.


## Overview

The book explains the original, principles of banking, including lending policy and liquidity management, and why these need to be restored in order to avoid another bank crisis at the time of the next economic recession. It covers asset-liability management, liquidity risk, internal transfer pricing, capital management, and stress testing. The book considers business cycles as patterns of stable and stressful market behavior, and provides examples illustrating the key principles of bank asset-liability management. It illustrates how unsound banking practices in previous bank crashes were repeated during the creation of the 2007-2008 financial market crisis. It also offers readers access to an accompanying website holding policy templates and teaching aids.

In the second edition of The Principles of Banking, contents are organized into six parts:

* Banking, bank customer business and regulation
* Bank asset-liability management
* Bank liquidity risk management
* Bank strategy and governance
* Principles of risk management and regulation
* Guide to the companion website

Nihar Mehta, who holds the position of Chief Corporate Development Officer at Monument Bank Ltd in London, expressed his high regard for "The Principles of Banking". He considers it the most crucial text for those in the banking industry and strongly believes that it should be an obligatory part of everyone's personal growth agendas. Mr. Mehta drew on his past experiences when he was a part of the UK Financial Services Authority, leading the change in control team. His responsibilities then included scrutinizing and granting regulatory approvals for intricate banking transactions, an example being the takeover of Northern Rock by Virgin Money. During that process, he found himself relying significantly on Professor Choudhry's text as a key reference for acquiring banking licenses.

Ted Teo, an adjunct assistant professor at NUS Business School in Singapore, shared his experience of teaching a banking course. He initially struggled to find suitable textbooks that presented a real-life banking perspective, a challenge he managed to overcome when he discovered books by Professor Choudhry. According to him, Choudhry's books accurately portray the perspective and methodology employed by bankers. They stand out by offering a practical and non-theoretical approach to understanding banking.
