He was reportedly under consideration to succeed Charles William Eliot as President of Harvard University, however he denied having interest in the position.

As its first president, he helped diversify the Boston Chamber of Commerce, as well as to establish a juvenile court. A prominent Democrat, Storrow also often served as a mediator between corporate interests, the city, and labor unions.

In 1901, Storrow began a campaign to dam the Charles River and create the Charles River Basin, as well as to preserve and improve the riverbanks as a public park. Storrow faced opposition from some of Boston's powerful influences, including the city's chamber of commerce; however, the Massachusetts legislature approved the dam in 1903.

He ran for a seat on the new committee as a member of the Democratic "Regular", Republican, and Public School Association tickets. He was elected to a three-year term and served as chairman from 1906 to 1908.


### Mayoral candidacy

In November 1909, Boston voters approved a charter change that made city elections nonpartisan and increased the mayor's term from two years to four years. Due to November voting on the proposed charter change, the 1909 mayoral election was pushed back to January 1910.

On November 17, 1909, the newly-formed Citizens' Municipal League chose Storrow as its candidate for mayor. The Citizens' Municipal League was made up mostly of Republicans, but Storrow was able to secure the endorsement of Democratic city committee president James Donovan and Congressman John A. Keliher. His campaign was managed by Edmund Billings, former secretary of the Good Government Association of Boston.

Storrow lost the race to former mayor John F. Fitzgerald 47,172 to 45,757.

On July 8, 1913, as part of agreement between the Boston Elevated Railway and the Boston Street Carmen's Union, Storrow was chosen to serve as chairman of a board of arbitrators that would settle issues between the two sides.

In 1919, Boston faced a possible strike by its police officers who were seeking the right to form a union under a charter from the American Federation of Labor. With police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis at odds with the rank and file police, Boston Mayor Andrew J. Peters appointed Storrow to chair an ad hoc Citizen's Committee to review the matter. Storrow's group recommended that the police be allowed to form their own union, but that it should be independent and not affiliated with any other organization like the AFL. Commissioner Curtis rejected the recommendation and Boston experienced a dramatic police strike.

Storrow organized a system of fuel distribution for Massachusetts and wrote and enforced the rules regarding fuel restrictions in all of New England.

In 1922, Governor Channing Cox named Storrow chairman of an advisory coal committee that was in charge of rationing coal during the UMW General coal strike. During this time, Storrow was the consignee of all coal shipped into the state.
