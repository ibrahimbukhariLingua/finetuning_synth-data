Tanomoshiko


# Tanomoshiko



**Tanomoshiko** (also spelt **Tanomoshi-ko** or **Tanomosiko**) (Japanese: 頼母子講) ("reliable group") is a variety of rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) found in Japan. Historically these associations played a major role in the economic life of Japan and among the Japanese diaspora, and still survive on an informal basis in some parts of the country.


## Name

*Tanomoshi* or *Tanomoshiko* (頼母子講) has also been called *mujin* (無尽) or *moai* (模合) in Japan. The name may be derived from *tanomu* meaning begging, or from *tayori ni naru mono* meaning reliance.


## History

*Tanomoshi*, denoting a locally organized social finance scheme, has existed in Japan at least since the middle Kamakura period (1185–1333). The principle was that each member would contribute a sum at regular intervals and would receive a single payment when their turn came round; it required mutual trust among those involved. The institution facilitated personal savings, investment in property and enterprise, insurance, personal loans and assistance of poorer people. By the Tokugawa period (1603–1868) *tanomoshi* was widespread. During the later 19th century under the Meiji, commercial banks developed, but as the banks were reluctant to offer small-scale and personal banking services they did not altogether supersede *tanomoshi*, which were incorporated into mutually financed *mujin* companies in 1915. Neither was *tanomoshi* fully replaced by state social security when it was implemented in the early 20th century. The system also operated among Japanese immigrants to the United States and Brazil, helping them in establishing new businesses there. Indeed while it diminished in Japan itself it remained of great importance to overseas Japanese communities.

The institution went into decline after World War II, with the further growth of commercial banks and social security and the loosening of community bonds, but still exists in some parts of Japan. During the 1970s there were estimated to be 20–30 *tanomoshi* groups involving economically better-off members of *Buraku* communities.


## Current

*Tanomoshi* still functions in certain areas, especially Kyushu and Okinawa. For example, in Okinawa prefecture, *tanomoshi* is active under the name of *moai*, and a local currency called Moai Cho has been sold in a stationery store (e.g., Editorial Team for Encyclopedia to Know Okinawa, 2000; Shimokawa, 2006). In Aizu region of Fukushima prefecture, *tanomoshi* called *mujin* has supported savings for leisure mainly in restaurants once a month (e.g., Kimura, 2001). However, in general, it is considered that traditional financial services based on mutual help and solidarity is not necessary anymore. Instead, consumer loans emerged as a new way to borrow money.

Most *tanomoshiko* are organized within a workplace or among friends. The members may use the funds built up to finance a trip or a banquet. It is most used by members of social minorities who are less prone to borrow money from financial institutions. The institution has little or no legal status.
