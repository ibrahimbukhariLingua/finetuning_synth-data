Fingerprint Cards


# Fingerprint Cards



**Fingerprint Cards** is a Swedish biometrics company that develops and produces biometric systems. Fingerprint Cards was founded in 1997 by Lennart Carlson.

Their products consist of fingerprint sensors, algorithms, packaging technologies and software for biometric recognition.


## History

The development of the fingerprint sensor started during the 1980s by Bo Löfberg. He worked to develop a fingerprint sensor during his last years and later patented the technology before he died in 1986. The sensor was only half way finished at the time of his death but the license was sold to Lennart Carlson who later started his company in 1997, Fingerprint Cards. The company went public in 1998, but still did not have a completed product to sell. On the CeBIT fare in 1999 Ericsson Mobile Communications could showcase a prototype accessory for the Ericsson line of mobile phones that was using a licensed sensor and ASIC from Fingerprint Cards. They also managed to secure licensing deals with Motorola and Texas Instruments, the latter developed an authentication platform known as FADT, the Fingerprint Authentication Development tool based on Fingerprints sensors but using Texas Instruments TMS320 rather than the company's own ASICs for algorithmic processing. Fingerprint Cards made large losses in the developing process and investors had to raise 250 million SEK before the company started produce revenue. Lennart Carlson stepped down as CEO in 2009 and Johan Carlström took over the position from 2009 — 2015.


### 2013 — 2015

Fingerprint Cards' first sensor was launched in 2013. It was compatible with Android and Windows. Johan Carlström resigned in 2015 as CEO because of the ongoing investigation against him and Jörgen Lantto took over the position as CEO in 2015. During 2015, Fingerprint Cards started to generate sales and its stock started to rise. Fingerprint Cards stock price rose from 6 SEK in the beginning of the year 2015, to 118.20 SEK by the end of the year. Fingerprint cards was a heavily traded stock during 2015.


### 2015 — present

On 3 July 2017, Fingerprint Cards was included on the OMX Stockholm 30 which is the 30 most traded stocks in terms of turnover on the Stockholm stock exchange. Fingerprint cards was later removed on 2 July 2018.

As the company experienced growing competition, they announced five profit warnings during 2017 and 2018 which caused the stock price to plummet. At its peak, Fingerprint Cards had a market value of 42.7 billion SEK compared to its current market value of 4.2 billion SEK as of May 2019. In July 2018, the company said that conditions were challenging and that it expected the demand for fingerprint sensors to continue to decline. Fingerprint Cards has since worked on diversifying its business with iris recognition and smartcards.

In 2016, Jörgen Lantto was replaced as CEO by Christian Fredrikson, who is the current CEO of Fingerprint Cards. On 21 March 2017, Fingerprint Cards' stock fell 40% after a profit warning. Since then, the stock has continued on a downward trend with constantly declining profits in their annual reports. In the middle of 2018, the stock price was at a low of 6 SEK, the stock has since recovered and is trading at around 13 SEK as of April 2019. Revenue in 2016 was 6638 million SEK, 2966 million SEK in 2017 and 1535 million SEK in 2018.


## Customers & Partnerships


### Customers

Fingerprint Cards' sensors are mainly used in smartphones and since its first inclusion in the Android phone in 2014, over 330 different phone models feature Fingerprint Cards' technology. Fingerprint Cards has sold over a billion sensors since its first commercial sensor in 2013. Some of the most recognisable companies that use Fingerprint Cards' technology include; Google, Huawei, Oppo and BlackBerry. Fingerprint Cards' sensor, FPC1025, was chosen by Google for their first Pixel smartphone. The newest Pixel also include a Fingerprint Cards sensor (FPC1035) which was released on 8 May 2019.

Huawei have been using Fingerprint Cards' product in their smartphones since 2015. Some of their models with Fingerprint Cards technology include their new phones; Nova 3e and Enjoy 8. Vsmart Aris and Vsmart Aris Pro also have launched, integrating the side-mounted sensor FPC1540 by Fingerprints.


### Partnerships

Fingerprint Cards is working together with Precise Biometrics, STMicroelectronics and Gemalto to replace Username/Password applications. Fingerprint Cards and its partners are working on the development of a smartwatch which will embed a fingerprint sensor from Fingerprint Cards. Precise Biometrics provides the algorithm for fingerprint recognition and STMicroelectronics will supply the semiconductor.

Fingerprint Cards is also working together with Gemalto to introduce fingerprint scanners into credit cards (Smart card). The digital security firm Gemalto has selected Fingerprint Cards technology for the next generations dual interface payment cards. The payment cards will use Fingerprint Cards with flexible T-shape sensors with an ultra-low power consumption. The current order consists of a few hundred thousands of the T-shape sensor which will be delivered through 2019 and 2020.


## Subsidiaries

Fingerprint Cards has acquired two companies since it was founded in 1997. The first acquisition was made in 2014 when they acquired AnaCatum Design. The second acquisition was the California-based company Delta ID in 2017.


### AnaCatum Design

In 2014, Fingerprint Cards acquired AnaCatum Design AB for an undisclosed amount. AnaCatum is a Swedish-based company from Linköping, founded in 2009. AnaCatum Design AB specialises in technology licensing and ASIC development. Shortly after the acquisition in 2014, AnaCatum and Fingerprint Cards announced a new fingerprint sensor, the FPC1150. The FPC1150 was the world's first touch fingerprint sensor that could be mounted on the front side of Android smartphones. The development of the FPC1150 was possible through cooperation with AnaCatum Design. The new sensor was half the size of the previous sensor (FPC1020), allowing it to be mounted in the home button of mobile devices. This had never been possible before due to size constraints. Previous sensors that the company had developed could only be mounted on the backside of smartphones.


### Delta ID

In 2017, Fingerprint Cards acquired Delta ID. Delta ID was founded in 2011 and based in California. Delta ID was acquired by Fingerprint Cards for US$106 million. Delta ID develops biometric authentication based on iris recognition for smartphones, PC, tablets and vehicles. Since the acquisition, many of the officials in Delta ID has decided to leave the company. In January 2018, Vice President (Vivek Khandelwal) left Delta ID and started working for another company. Sales manager, Dillon Xiao and CFO, Hue Harguindeguy, has also left their positions at Delta ID since the acquisition.


## Hardware & Software

Fingerprint Cards manufacture different sensors which uses different technology for fingerprint recognition. These theologies include;

* Touch based
* Swipe based
* Area based

Fingerprint Cards touch based sensors works on capacitive sensor principle. Capacitive fingerprint sensors use electric current to image the ridges and valleys in a fingerprint. The swipe fingerprint sensor uses 3D sensing technology to image a high-resolution 3D picture of the fingerprint. Rolling or pressing the finger against a sensor can cause inconsistencies because the skin deforms when being pressed against the sensor. 3D touch-less fingerprint scanners can overcome these problems for a faster and more consistent authentication. The area-based fingerprint sensor works by reflecting light to capture an image of the fingerprint.

Since 2017, Fingerprint cards has also been working on diversifying their product portfolio with alternative authentication solutions such as face and iris recognition.


### Products

Some of their products include; FPC touch sensor series, FPC1200-series, FPC1300-series. The products small size and low energy consumption allow the technology to be implemented into small products such as smartcards and smartphones. Fingerprint Cards is currently listed on Nasdaq OMX large cap.
