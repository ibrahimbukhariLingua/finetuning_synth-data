## Key holdings


### Chicago Fire Soccer Club

From 2007 to 2019, Andell owned Major League Soccer's Chicago Fire Soccer Club, purchasing the Club from AEG in 2007 for $35 million. Under Andell’s ownership, the Club experienced dramatic growth, with the franchise value increasing more than eleven-fold, culminating in a sale at $400 million.

The club was consistently recognized for its deep community engagement, including being awarded ESPN's 2019 Sports Humanitarian Team of the Year Award, the 2017 Corporate Citizen of the Year Award by the Executives' Club of Chicago, the 2016 Beyond Sport Team of the Year, winning over other finalists FC Barcelona, Arsenal FC, the San Francisco Giants, and the Detroit Pistons, and the 2015 Robert Wood Johnson Sport Team of the Year.

Andell’s Chairman, Andrew Hauptman, led a complex and successful multi-year effort to move the team to downtown Chicago and Soldier Field. In September 2019, after securing the relocation of the team downtown, Hauptman sold the Fire to Joe Mansueto, founder of Morningstar, Inc.


### BSN Sports

From 2007 until 2013, Andell was co-owner of BSN Sports (formerly Sports Supply Group), the largest multi-channel direct marketer, manufacturer and distributor of sporting goods, athletic equipment and team sports apparel in the United States. After acquiring an ownership stake in the publicly-traded business in 2007, Hauptman brought ONCAP Management Partners (a part of Onex Corporation) to the table, and alongside management, orchestrated a take-private transaction in 2010.

In June 2013, a strategic buyer purchased BSN. Andell realized more than a 4.5x gross multiple of its capital invested, representing a 67.6% gross IRRᶜˡᵃʳⁱᶠⁱᶜᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ over the last three-year investment period.


### Storage Mobility/PODS

From 2004 through 2014, Andell founded, owned, and operated Storage Mobility, the largest franchisee of PODS Enterprises, Inc.

Under Hauptman’s tenure as Chairman of the Board, Storage Mobility launched and operated PODS locations in 21 new markets across the United States. In 2014, Hauptman reached an agreement to merge Storage Mobility with PODS which subsequently sold in 2015 to Ontario Teachers for $1 billion.


### Altas Partners

In 2013, Andell backed the launch of Toronto-based Altas Partners, Canada’s largest independent private equity firm, managing more than $9 billion in capital. Hauptman currently serves as an advisor and founding Advisory Board member. Andell has invested alongside Altas in a number of businesses that have been successfully exited, including NSC Minerals (sold to Kissner Group); Medforth Global Healthcare Education (sold to Carlyle Group); and Capital Vision Services/MyEyeDr, representing 165 optometry centers serving 1.8 million patients in seven states. MyEyeDr grew to 575 practices in 18 states and was sold to Goldman Sachs for $2.7 billion. Andell has also invested alongside Altas in many of its current investments, including Hub International, a leading insurance broker; University of St. Augustine, a physical and occupational therapist educator; DuBois Chemicals, a specialty chemical provider; and Unified Women’s Healthcare, the largest ob-gyn physician practice management company in the U.S.
