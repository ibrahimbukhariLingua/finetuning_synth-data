**2014-2015 Ranking Controversy**

In 2012, the *Journal of Product Innovation Management* published a study that ranked the school number 1 in the world for research in innovation management. However, the methodology of the study and the independence of its authors was questioned. In March 2015, the journal published an "expression of concern" regarding the study.

After a 2014 investigation led by the Kansas City Star, and a subsequent audit by an international accounting firm, the school was found to have knowingly falsified its ranking to the Princeton Review. The UMKC business school lost 4 years of rankings from the Princeton Review for falsifying data.
