Business valuation standard


# Business valuation standard



**Business Valuation Standards** (**BVS**) are codes of practice that are used in business valuation. Examples of business appraisal standards are as follows:

* CVA Professional Standards published by the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts.
* CICBV Practice Standards. Published by the CBV Institute.
* Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Standards 9 and 10 cover business valuation and reporting standards. Published by the Appraisal Foundation.
* International Valuation Standards. Published by the International Valuation Standards Council.
* Statement on Standards for Valuation Services (SSVS No 1). Published by the American Institute of CPAs.

A comparison of global standards for NACVA, GACVA, IVSC, RICS, and CBV was published on 1 June 2023.

In addition, each of the three major United States valuation societies—the American Society of Appraisers (ASA), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPA/ABV), and the National Association of Certified Valuators and Analysts (NACVA)—has its own set of Business Valuation Guidelines, which it requires all of its accredited members to adhere to. The AICPA's standards are published as Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No.1 and the ASA's guidelines are published as the *ASA Business Valuation Guidelines, which largely follow the USPAP Standard requirements*. All AICPA members are required to follow SSVS1. Additionally, the majority of the State Accountancy Boards have adopted VS Section 100 for CPAs licensed in their state.
