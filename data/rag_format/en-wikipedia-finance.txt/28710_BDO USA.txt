BDO stands for Binder, Dijker, and Otte, the original founders of the firm.


## History

BDO USA, P.C was founded as Seidman and Seidman in New York City in 1910 by three immigrant brothers: Maximillian L. Seidman, Francis E. Seidman, and Jacob S. Seidman. At that time the accounting profession was in its infancy, with fewer than 2,200 practicing CPAs in the United States. Shortly thereafter in 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, followed by the Revenue Act of 1913 with new impositions of U.S. federal income tax enacted by Congress in that year. M. L. Seidman saw the potential of the accountant's role to provide tax services to individuals. By 1917, Congress enacted the first revenue bills and the U.S. entry into World War I created the need for corporate income and excess profit taxes. At the same time, federal spending rose to $18.9 billion with 58 percent of the federal revenues provided from income taxes. M.L. Seidman and his siblings, who joined him in his new accounting firm, seized the opportunity to provide tax services to businesses in addition to individuals.


### Expansion

An era of expansion began. Fostered by the federal government's conversion of furniture and woodworking companies to aircraft production for the war effort, the firm opened an office in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1917. Seidman and Seidman quickly established itself as a leader in serving the furniture industry by developing the first effective furniture plant costing system. Today, BDO Seidman's furniture industry practice remains in the industry.

In 1925, the firm rapidly expanded, opening offices in Jamestown, Illinois, and Rockford, Illinois, followed by Chicago in 1921, and Gardner, Massachusetts, in 1924. In 1922, J. S. Seidman joined the firm as a founding member.

The 1930s brought another new beginning for the accounting profession. In 1933, Congress passed the Securities Act, requiring public corporations to have financial statements included in registration statements and periodic reports reported on by independent CPAs. A year later, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to administer the new legislation.

In 1950, L. William Seidman joined the firm and ultimately became its managing partner before leaving for government service, most notably as chair of the FDIC.


### Development of the national firm

The firm continued to grow and by the 1960s, truly became a national firm. On April 1, 1968, the firm was converted into a national general partnership. This marked the beginning of a new era of expansion. Over the years to the present, the firm established many offices throughout the United States.


## Present

Today, BDO USA, P.C. has more than 75 offices and more than 400 independent alliance firm locations nationwide. During this timeframe, BDO International was created and has grown to become the fifth largest accounting and consulting network in the world with over 1,591 member firm offices in 162 countries.

In February 2009, BDO USA, P.C. launched the firm's first-ever national advertising campaign: "People Who Know, Know BDO".

In June 2012, the monitor (Joseph A. Smith Jr.) of the National Mortgage Settlement announced he engaged BDO USA, P.C. as his primary professional firm. BDO joined the monitor and his team for a period of three and a half years overseeing implementation of the historic National Mortgage Settlement involving 49 states, the United States government and five of the nation's largest banks.
