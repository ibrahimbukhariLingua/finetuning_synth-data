In October 2022, it was announced that Campus Apartments plans to construct a new 162,000 square foot headquarters on 41st and Walnut streets by 2026 featuring 136 new residential units and office space. In July 2024, Campus Apartments broke ground on a $148.75 million graduate student housing development at the University of Maryland, College Park, featuring a 323,000-square-foot LEED Silver-certified residential building that will provide 741 beds for the 2026-2027 academic year.


### Entrepreneurial ventures

In 2007, Adelman co-founded FS Investments, a $24 billion alternative investment firm, with headquarters in Philadelphia. In February 2023, FS Investments merged with Portfolio Advisors, a private asset management firm, creating a combined company with over $73 billion in assets under management.

In 2013, Adelman, with group of Philadelphia-based investors, led a $30 million investment into private aviation company Wheels Up, founded by serial entrepreneur Kenny Dichter. Adelman serves as the Lead Director. On December 19, 2019, Delta Air Lines announced it took a stake in Wheels Up to become its largest investor and merged it with its Delta Private Jets subsidiary. On January 5, 2021, Wheels Up announced its acquisition of Mountain Aviation, the 10th largest private jet charter operator in the U.S., bringing its total fleet to 350 aircraft. On February 1, 2021, Wheels Up announced a SPAC-based IPO valued at $2.1 billion. The deal brings Wheels Up together with SPAC Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp. that counts funds associated with luxury conglomerate LVMH and its boss, Bernard Arnault. It began trading in July 2021. In August 2023, Wheels Up enhanced its partnership with Delta Air Lines through a strategic $400 million financing agreement, with Delta becoming the company's largest investor alongside other strategic partners.

Adelman is also a co-founder of cred.ai, a FinTech company launched in August 2020, that uses AI to establish and improve consumers' credit.

In October 2020 Adelman co-led an investment into VIDE Beverages, a ready-to-drink vodka soda brand, with model, actress and entrepreneur Olivia Culpo.

On February 18, 2021, Adelman acquired a full ownership stake in American Harvest Vodka and Beach Whiskey as part of a newly formed Darco Spirits Company, under his Darco Capital umbrella. In March 2023, Beach Whiskey announced the launch of its new Beach Whiskey Canned Cocktails.

### 76 Place and Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment

In July 2022, it was announced that Adelman would chair 76 Devcorp, a project managing company responsible for developing 76 Place at Market East, a proposed new stadium for the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers located in Center City, Philadelphia. In October 2022, Adelman bought a 10% ownership stake in Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment from Michael G. Rubin, which owns and operates the 76ers, the NHL's New Jersey Devils, and the Prudential Center. On December 19, 2024, Philadelphia City Council approved Adelman's plans for the $1.3 billion 76 Place arena project in a 12–5 vote. The 18,500-seat arena, set to be built next to Chinatown, is scheduled to begin construction in 2028 with completion targeted for the 2031-32 NBA season. As part of the development, Adelman committed to a $60 million community benefits agreement supporting the city, school district, Chinatown, and minority-owned businesses.
As of January 12, 2025, plans to build the Market East arena near Chinatown were abandoned. Instead, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment announced a 50-50 joint venture with Comcast Spectacor to build a new arena in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex that would house both the 76ers and Flyers. The agreement came after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver helped broker peace between the two companies, bringing an end to their long-running dispute over the team's future arena plans.


## Personal life

When the $36 million Alan Horwitz 'Sixth Man' Center operated by Philadelphia Youth Basketball opened in Philadelphia in July 2024, Adelman served as a lead donor, with the Adelman Family Stadium Court named to honor his longtime mentor and Campus Apartments founder Alan Horwitz, who initiated the project with a $5 million gift and whose passionate 76ers fandom earned him the nickname 'Sixth Man'.

He is married to children's book author and film producer Hallee Adelman. In April 2024, Forbes cited Adelman's net worth at over $2 billion.
