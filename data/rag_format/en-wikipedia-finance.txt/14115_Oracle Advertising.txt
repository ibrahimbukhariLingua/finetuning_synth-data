## History

Datalogix was founded in Westminster, Colorado in 2002 to collect consumer data.

In May 2014, Datalogix raised $45 million in a Series C round led by Wellington Management Company. This round, joined by existing investor IVP, brought Datalogix to $86.5 million in funding plus an undisclosed round raised from Breyer Capital. In April 2013, the company raised $25 million.

In December 2014, Oracle acquire Datalogix. After the acquisition, Datalogix's name changed to Oracle Data Cloud, which later became Oracle Advertising. Oracle Advertising is part of the Oracle Advertising and Customer Experience (CX) application suite.

In 2017, Oracle also acquired Moat, an ad measurement company, which also became part of Oracle Data Cloud, which would become Oracle Advertising. The Moat acquisition added measurement and analytics capabilities to allow advertisers to track and measure media, as well as the performance of interactions with online ads.

BlueKai, a company acquired by Oracle in 2014, was merged into and became part of Oracle Marketing after the acquisition of Datalogix. Blue Kai was a cloud-based data collection platform that used website cookies to collect online tracking data.

## Privacy issues with consumer data collection

Some consumers and agencies are against companies that use Datalogix because it brings into question the issue of consent, as a vast majority of consumers do not want their information collected, measured, or sold. The FTC was involved in investigating a deal between Datalogix and Facebook, to see if it violated privacy issues.

Datalogix obtains data from Facebook users by matching e-mail addresses from a Customer Relationship Management database (CRM), along with additional information people use to create personal Facebook accounts, in order to tailor specific audiences for advertisers. Datalogix tailors specific audiences by grouping consumers together according to their similar interests, behavior patterns, or demographics. The company reports that it keeps the information anonymous and gives consumers the option to opt out of data collecting and reporting by selecting the opt-out option on its website.
