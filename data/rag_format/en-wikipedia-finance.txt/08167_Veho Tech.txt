# Veho Tech



**Veho Technologies** is an American logistics service company based in New York, U.S, providing last-mile delivery and return services. The company was founded in 2016, launching a mobile app matching gig-economy drivers with package deliveries in their local areas. The company's name "Veho" comes from Latin, meaning "to carry."


## History

Veho was founded by Itamar Zur in Boston, Massachusetts, where Zur was a student at Harvard Business School, The concept of Veho originated from Zur's experience with a meal delivery subscription service, that never delivered him a package he ordered. Zur then moved to Colorado in 2018, where Fred Cook joined as co-founder and chief technology officer.

Veho launched as an app enabling anyone with a vehicle to deliver packages, with a pilot program that delivered over 10,000 packages in Boston.

In 2017, while Zur was still at Harvard, Veho won the prize in the Harvard Business School's annual New Venture Competition.

In 2019, Veho graduated from the Techstars' Boulder accelerator program and received an investment of $1 million in the same year.

By 2021, Veho had added operations in Atlanta, Central Maryland, Milwaukee, Northern Virginia, and Philadelphia, while further expanding in Texas (adding Austin, San Antonio, and Houston) and Colorado (Fort Collins and Colorado Springs).

In 2022, Veho acquired QuikReturn, a reverse logistics company that was active in New York City and the surrounding areas.
