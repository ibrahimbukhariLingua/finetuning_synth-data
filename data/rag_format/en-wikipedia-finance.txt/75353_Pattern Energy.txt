**Pattern Energy Group LP** is an American company that develops, owns and operates utility scale wind and solar power facilities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is headquartered in San Francisco, California with an operations center in Houston, Texas.


## History

Pattern Energy was organized in 2009 by Riverstone Holdings to acquire assets from Babcock & Brown's North American wind energy group. In 2013 the company sold operating assets to Pattern Energy Group Inc. following that company's initial public offering (IPO). The development assets of Pattern Energy were retained by a privately held entity.

On March 16, 2020, Pattern Energy Group Inc. was acquired by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and taken private through a reverse merger transaction. In connection with the going private transaction, Pattern Energy Group LP acquired 28 renewable energy facilities from Pattern Energy Group Inc. with an aggregate operating capacity of 4.4 gigawatts. As of August 2023 the company's aggregate installed operating capacity was approaching 6,000 megawatts.

In July 2022, Pattern Energy acquired the SunZia Transmission line project from SouthWestern Power Group, through private funding.
