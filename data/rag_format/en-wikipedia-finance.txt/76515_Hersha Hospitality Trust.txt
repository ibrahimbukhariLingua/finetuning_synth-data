## History

In January 1979, Indian-American immigrant Hasu P. Shah and his wife, Hersha, bought an 11-room motel near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Five years later, Hasu Shah formed the company and purchased a hotel in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

In January 1999, a year after being organized into a Maryland real estate investment trust, it became a public company via an initial public offering. In May 2006, the firm acquired four Boston-area hotels for $44 million.

In June 2015, the company acquired the St. Gregory Hotel in Washington, D.C. for $57 million. Before acquiring The Ritz-Carlton, Georgetown for $49.9 million, Hersha sold seven of its Manhattan hotels in February 2016 to a joint venture with Chinese company Cindat Capital Management.

In August 2023, private equity firm KSL Capital Partners announced an agreement to purchase Hersha for $10.00 per share, for a total of $1.4 billion. The share price represented a 60% increase over the closing share price the day before the agreement was announced.

In November 2023, it was announced that KSL had completed the purchase of the company.
