The organization provides women and allies with a community to lean on and learn from through community, online and offline education, inspiration, and opportunity. Founded in 1997 to bring high-achieving women in finance together, the network now serves women across industries and around the world. Its CEO is Anusha Harid-Paoletti and Owner/Managing Partner is Allyson McDonald.

## History

Ellevate was founded in 1997 as 85 Broads by Janet Hanson. Hanson had formerly worked at Goldman Sachs and formed the organization as an alumnae network for women who had left the firm. The name came from the address of New York's Goldman Sachs office.

Sallie Krawcheck, former head of global wealth management at Merrill Lynch, acquired 85 Broads Unlimited LLC in 2013 and rebranded the organization as Ellevate in 2014. When Krawcheck acquired the network, it was broadly accepted as a move "that could send a shock wave through the financial services sector." Krawcheck responded by underlining the importance of women's engagement in economy and cited the year 2013 as a "tipping point" for women in the workplace. Following Krawcheck's acquisition, Hanson stayed involved with the organization as Chairman Emeritus and as an advisor to Krawcheck. The organization's name derives from the French pronoun "elle," meaning "she" and Ellevate's core purpose of elevating women at work.

In late 2022, Allyson McDonald, investor and former President of Ellevate Network, purchased the organization from Krawcheck. Ally McDonald is the Managing Member and majority owner. Janet Hanson has retained her interest in the organization and is a key member of Ellevate's Advisory Board. McDonald recently announced the appointment of Anusha Harid-Paoletti as CEO of Ellevate Network
