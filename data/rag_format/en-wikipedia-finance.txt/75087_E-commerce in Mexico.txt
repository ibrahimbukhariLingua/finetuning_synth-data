E-commerce in Mexico


# E-commerce in Mexico



The **e-commerce market in Mexico** in 2015 was estimated by Forbes to be 12 billion U.S. dollars and by the Mexican Internet Association AMIPCI to be 257.1 billion Mexico pesos (about 15.6 billion U.S. dollars). This represented 1.6–2% of all retail sales vs. a global average of 7%.


## Characteristics of the market

E-commerce in Mexico takes place primarily through the use of websites and apps, but it can also be conducted through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger (sometimes using chatbots), and leads generated on social media.

According to estimates in 2016, around 70% of Mexicans had access to the internet. E-commerce volume in Mexico grew by 900% between 2009 and 2015.

While debit and credit cards are commonly used for e-commerce payments in Mexico, cash is also an important payment method. Nearly half of Mexicans have used cash to make an e-commerce purchase. Transactions are completed online, and the website provides a reference number. Customers must then bring this reference number and the cash to a convenience store, supermarket, or bank that accepts cash payments and charges a commission.


## Associations

Organizations include the **Asociación de Internet.mx** (formerly AMIPCI), and **AMVO** (Asociación Mexicana de la Venta Online) which organizes the annual HotSale, a sale on e-commerce channels only across a broad range of Mexican retailers.
