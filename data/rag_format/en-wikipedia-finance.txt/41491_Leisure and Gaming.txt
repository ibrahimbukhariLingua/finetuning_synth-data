# Leisure and Gaming



**Leisure and Gaming plc** (also "L&G") was formerly a holding company based in London, and listed on the London Stock Exchange with major assents in the global interactive betting and gaming industry. Its interests spanned from software development to marketing.


## History

L&G was incorporated in England and Wales in August 2004. Its registered holders are BNY Norwich Union Nominees Ltd, Chase GA Group Nominees Ltd, Chase Nominees Ltd, CUIM Nominee Ltd, and Vidacos Nominees Ltd.

L&G acquired Betshop, a European betting and gaming business, in 2006. In October 2006, immediately preceding passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, the company sold its US-facing online gambling business to a private group for US$1, and no longer accepted wagers from US residents. The subsidiaries divested in this exit were Bon Bini, ECom ServCorp, English Harbour, Nine.com and VIP. This left Betshop as the company's main operating subsidiary.

By 2008ᵘᵖᵈᵃᵗᵉ, the company's properties consisted of BetShop Italia, BetShop.com, GoalsLive.com and Acropolis Casino, the focus of which was expansion in Italy and Central and Eastern Europe.

Trading in shares of the company was suspended in May 2010. By October 2010, the company had received a demand from bankers for repayment of debts, and was subsequently placed into Administration due to its insolvency. Two principles of FRP Advisory executed a purchase of Betshop, thereby maintaining the company as a going concern and preserving operations in the UK, Italy, Cyprus and Greece.
