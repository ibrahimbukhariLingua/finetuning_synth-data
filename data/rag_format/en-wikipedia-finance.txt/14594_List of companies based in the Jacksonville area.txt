## Economic overview

Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port. Its riverine location facilitates two U.S. Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville, Florida's third largest seaport.

Interstate Highways 10 and 95 intersect in Jacksonville, creating the busiest intersection in the region with 200,000 vehicles each day. Interstate 10 ends at this intersection (the other end being in Santa Monica, California).

Three significant freight railroads call Jacksonville home, and there are four public airports available: Jacksonville International Airport, Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport, Herlong Recreational Airport and Cecil Airport at Cecil Commerce Center.

To emphasize the city's transportation capabilities, the Jacksonville Regional Chamber of Commerce filed "Jacksonville America's Logistics Center" as a trademark on November 9, 2007. It was formally registered on August 4, 2009. Cornerstone began promoting the city as "Jacksonville: America's Logistics Center" in 2009. Signs were added to the existing city limit markers on Interstate 95.

Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking, insurance, and healthcare.

As with much of Florida, tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf.
