## History

Zapier was founded in Columbia, Missouri by Wade Foster, Bryan Helmig, and Mike Knoop in 2011. The following year, they were accepted to the Y Combinator startup seed accelerator and temporarily relocated to Mountain View, California. In October 2012, Zapier received a $1.3 million seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners.

In March 2017, the company offered a "relocation package", consisting of a $10,000 moving reimbursement to employees who wished to leave the San Francisco Bay Area.

In 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic spread, Zapier set up a $1 million small business assistance fund for struggling customers.

Sequoia Capital and Steadfast Financial bought shares from some of the company's original investors in January 2021 at a valuation of $5 billion.

In March 2021, the company acquired Makerpad, a no-code education service, for an undisclosed sum of money.

As of January 2022, the company employs approximately 500 people in 38 countries.
