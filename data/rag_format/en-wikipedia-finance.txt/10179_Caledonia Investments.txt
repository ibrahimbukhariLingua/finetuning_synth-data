## History

The company which became Caledonia Investments was incorporated in 1928 as the *Foreign Railways Investment Trust Ltd*. It was acquired by the Cayzer family in 1951 to hold their diverse interests and was renamed *Caledonia Investments Ltd*. In 1955 Caledonia acquired the Cayzer family's interest in the *British & Commonwealth Shipping Co. Ltd*, formed out of the merger of *Clan Line* (started by the Cayzer family in 1881) and *Union-Castle Line*. In 1960 the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange and in 1981 their name was changed to Caledonia Investments PLC. After their holding in British & Commonwealth was sold in 1987, Caledonia Investments became a diversified trading and investment company, which in turn was converted into a UK Investment trust company on 1 April 2003. The Cayzer family collectively owns some 48.5% of the share capital of Caledonia Investments plc.
