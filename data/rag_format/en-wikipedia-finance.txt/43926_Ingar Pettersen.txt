## Biography

He was the chief financial officer in Oslo municipality in the late 1980s. He resigned in March 1990. From 1996 to 1997 he was an acting chief executive at Ullevål Hospital. He also chaired Aker Hospital from 1994 to August 2000. In October 2000 he was named as chairman of Ullevål Hospital.

He was also leased by *Dagsavisen* in 2001 to save the newspaper's economy. He has performed the same task in several other newspaper such as *Østlendingen*, *Hamar Arbeiderblad*, *Ringsaker Blad* and *Moss Dagblad*, the book club De norske Bokklubbene, the publishing houses Aschehoug and Universitetsforlaget. He was hired by Bærum municipality in 2004 to help them cut up to 80 million off the health budget, then in Drammen municipality in mid-2005 to clean up their care services.

From 2005 to 2008 he chaired several health trusts in South and Eastern Norway; Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet and Sørlandet Hospital. A dispute in 2008 on whether to construct a new patient hotel at Radiumhospitalet led to Pettersen's resignation. Briefly in 2005 he was also a board member of Achima Helse, a company that leased workers to the same hospitals.

From 2008 to 2009 he was instead brought in as acting director of the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design.
