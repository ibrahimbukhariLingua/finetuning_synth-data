## Personal life

DeHaas grew up in Washington, Pennsylvania. Her mother was the only woman from the accounting program to graduate from University of Pittsburgh in 1951, and worked in Gulf Oil's accounting department while DeHaas's father went to medical school. After DeHaas's father became an obstetrician, her mother left accounting but became involved in local affairs. She started the Head Start program in Washington, and was the first woman on the local city council. DeHaas considers her mother to be a great influence in her career.
