# Bpeace



**Bpeace** (Business Council for Peace) is a not-for profit organization based in New York City, and founded in 2002. Bpeace operates under the slogan, “Bpeace believes the path to peace is lined with jobs.” And that “More jobs means less violence.” Under the leadership of co-founder and CEO, Toni Maloney, Bpeace works with entrepreneurs in conflict-affected countries to “scale their businesses, create significant employment for all, and expand the economic power of women." With an emphasis on advancing the role of women in business, Bpeace has reached the conflict-affected regions of Afghanistan, Rwanda and El Salvador.

Bpeace's primary donors include grassroots support members who pay dues, family foundations, and corporations such as Citibank and Microsoft. The U.S. Department of State has been a steady supporter, partially funding Bpeace's work in Afghanistan since 2004. The organization is also affiliated with Goldman-Sachs’ 10,000 Women Initiative. Bpeace has earned the GuideStar Exchange Seal, demonstrating its commitment to transparency.” “55% of the entrepreneurs who have participated with Bpeace since 2004 are still engaged with Bpeace and in business, 100% of them are generating income and 93% are self-sustaining. 54% maintained employment levels and 32% posted job growth.


## Mission

The stated goal of Bpeace is “to create one million jobs across 1,000 communities. In each community these businesspeople become role models and strong voices for peace.” Bpeace gives preference to female business owners, but has expanded to help promising entrepreneurs of either gender.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Bpeace’s methods are based on the concept that “The jobs that Fast Runners create have a multiplier effect – those jobs sustain thousands of families, boost local purchasing power, and in turn, strengthen other local businesses. This cycle of employment sets a once troubled community on the path to prosperity and peace.”

## Fast Running Around the World

In the conflict-affected regions in which Bpeace operates, Bpeace selects what they call “Fast Runners,” or entrepreneurs/small business owners whose motivation and talent bring job creation and economic growth to entire communities. Bpeace states, “We significantly invest in [Fast Runners] because when successful, the employment these Fast Runners generate sparks a multiplier effect that sustains thousands of families and boosts local purchasing power, which in turn lifts other businesses, creates even more employment, opens new markets and accelerates the community up the path to prosperity and peace.” Through a three-year mentoring program, experts are paired with a Fast Runner in the same business in order to advance the Fast Runner's productivity and achievement.

***Afghanistan***:

* *Dosti Soccer Balls*: a Bpeace supported joint-venture started by and employing women who hand-stitch soccer balls. These women work from their homes and support their families. The balls are marketed by Bpeace in the U.S. “Today, [DOSTI] collectively employs 475 Afghans…by stitching 500 soccer balls, or 1 – 2 balls per day, an Afghan woman can earn enough income from DOSTI to support a family of six for a year.”
* *BART*: The Bpeace Apprentice Road Trip, sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, brought Afghan Fast Runners to the United States in June 2005, October 2008, October 2010 and October 2011 to learn the tricks of their respective trades. Furniture makers, IT entrepreneurs, beauty salon owners, construction contractors and salt processors are a few examples of Afghan entrepreneurs who have traveled to the U.S.

***El Salvador***: the most recent country in the Bpeace program. Janis Grover and Laura Rotter were Bpeace’s First Traveling Mentors to El Salvador. They worked to improve productivity at a bakery, La Canasta, in 2011.

***Rwanda***: Examples of businesses in Rwanda that have been mentored through Bpeace include the country's first ice cream producer and shop, a hotel, funeral home, and landscaping business. In the Spring of 2011 Rwandan Fast Runners came to the U.S. on a BART.
