KSE 100 Index


# KSE 100 Index



The **KSE-100 Index** is a total return stock index acting as a benchmark to compare prices on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) over a period.

In determining representative companies to compute the index on, companies with the highest market capitalization are selected. However, to ensure full market representation, the company with the highest market capitalization from each sector is also included.


## History

KSE 100 Index was launched in November 1991 with a base of 1,000 points.

In November 1994, Baring Securities London recomposed the index and established rules for its recomposition.


### Steady growth

In 2001, the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) became the highest-performing stock market globally, supported by macroeconomic policies that increased foreign exchange reserves above five billion dollars and strengthened the rupee. Daily trading volumes reached approximately 200 million shares. The market's positive trajectory was temporarily affected by military tensions following an attack on the Indian parliament. Intervention by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and actions against militant groups by President Pervez Musharraf helped stabilize the situation. As a result, the KSE index rose by nearly 400 points, and the market capitalization reached 400 billion rupees.

By February 2007, it had skyrocketed to 12,285 points.


### 2007 (Record breaking growth)

Moreover, the increase of 7.4 per cent in 2008 made it the best performer among major emerging markets.

* **July 16**: KSE-100 Index dropped one-third from an all-time high hit in April, 2008 as rising pressure on shaky Pakistan's coalition government to tackle Taliban militants exacerbates concern about the country's economic woes.
* **August 18**: KSE 100 Index rose more than 4% after the announcement of the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf but Credit Suisse Group said that Pakistan's Post-Musharraf rally in Stock Exchange will be short-lived because of a rising fiscal deficit and runaway inflation.
* **August 28** : Karachi Stock Exchange set a floor for stock prices to halt a plunge that has wiped out $36.9 billion of market value since April.
* **December 15**: Trading resumes after the removal of floor on stock prices that was set on August 28 to halt sharp falls.

### 2020 (COVID-19)
