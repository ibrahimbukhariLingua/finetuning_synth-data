Novolipetsk Steel


# Novolipetsk Steel



**Novolipetsk Steel**, or **NLMK**, is one of the four largest steel companies in Russia. NLMK's share of domestic crude steel production is about 21%. It primarily produces flat steel products, semi-finished steel products and electrical steels. NLMK also produces specialty coated steels, plus high-ductility and micro-alloyed steels. It is the 21st-largest steel maker in the world. The larger NLMK group owns a number of other steel and mining industries, mostly in Russia.


## History

Historically, the Lipetsk area in central Russia has had substantial iron ore deposits. In 1702, Peter the Great ordered the construction of an iron foundry there.

In 1931, Novolipetsk Iron and Steel began construction of a plant on the site of the iron ore mine. Prospering down through the decades, Novolipetsk became a joint-stock company in 1992 and then in 1993 began the process of privatization by distributing company shares to its employees. The company seems to be acquisitive; see list of related organizations. In 1998, Vladimir Lisin became the chairman. The manufacturing area in Lipetsk covers 27 square kilometers.

Less than half of NLMK's output of steel is sold in Russia.

The company's primary source of iron ore is now Stoilensky GOK, a company which is 350Â km from the mills at Lipetsk.

## Ecology

Since 2007 NLMK has implemented a number of investment projects on environmental protection. In 2009 it stopped discharges of industrial wastewater into the river Voronezh. As the result of all the activities, the water consumption of the NLMK Group decreased from 120.4 million cubic meters per year in 2008 to 77.2 million cubic meters per year in 2012, and emissions into the atmosphere decreased by 40%.

NLMK reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 33,587 kilotonnes(+1,365/+4.2% y-o-y).
