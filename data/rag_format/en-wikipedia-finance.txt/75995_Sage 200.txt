## UK/Ireland version

The Sage 200cloud product in the UK and Ireland has its roots in a product called Sky accounting in the 1980s. Sky Software Limited was acquired by Sagesoft in October 1988. Sky was renamed as Sage Sovereign in 1991, and later Sage Line 100. Sovereign development was based in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire until 1991 when the team moved to the location of Sage's headquarters in Newcastle upon Tyne. Sovereign used a proprietary language called Retrieve 4GL that allowed third parties to extend the application. In the 1990s the London Stock Exchange listed company were using Sovereign for producing their own company's financial accounts. In the 1990s a Microsoft Windows version of Sovereign was produced alongside the DOS and UNIX versions.

With added cloud functionality the product gained its Sage 200cloud name in 2017. The UK/Ireland Sage 50cloud products are developed in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
