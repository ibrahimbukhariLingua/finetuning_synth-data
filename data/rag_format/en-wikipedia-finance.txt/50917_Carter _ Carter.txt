Carter & Carter


# Carter & Carter



**Carter & Carter Group plc** was a British-based public limited company that provided outsourced training services and apprenticeships on behalf of various international companies and UK government organisations, such as the Learning and Skills Council.

Established by Phillip Carter in 1992, the company employed 500 people and had its headquarters in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, England, with offices in Australia, Germany and Japan.

Following the death of founder Philip Carter in a helicopter accident on 2 May 2007, the company's shares were suspended on 3 October due to the uncertainty of its financial position.

In early March 2008, Carter & Carter entered into administration after it failed to reach agreement with its banks over a financial restructuring. Near to the end of the month, Newcastle College bought the majority of the company.
