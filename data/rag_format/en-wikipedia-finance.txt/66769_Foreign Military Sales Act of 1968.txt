The **Foreign Military Sales Act of 1968**, Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 90–629, 82 Stat. 1320-2, enacted October 22, 1968, was supplemental legislation to the Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Act discloses the United States commitment and sustainment to a world free from the dangers of armaments and the scourge of war.

The Foreign Military Sales Act supported the policy of regional arms control, disarmament agreements, and the discouragement of arm races. The H.R. 15681 bill authorized the sales of military equipment by the United States government. The United States law explicitly declares the sales of defense services and military articles to benevolent countries with the economic means to maintain and support a military force of adequate strength.

The H.R. 15681 legislation was passed by the 90th U.S. Congressional session and endorsed by the 36th President of the United States Lyndon Johnson on October 22, 1968.
