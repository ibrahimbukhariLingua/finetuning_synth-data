## History

On 9 December 2011, AMP announced a strategic business alliance between AMP Capital and
Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (MUTB), a leading Japanese trust bank which provides services to institutions and retail clients across retail and corporate banking, trust assets, real estate and global markets. MUTB acquired a minority interest in AMP Capital. The alliance will give AMP access to 80 percent of Japan's institutional investors, around 14 percent of its retail and high net worth banking networks and 100 retail securities brokerage branches. In 2020, AMP Limited repurchased MUTBâ€™s shareholding in AMP Capital.

AMP Capital also has a number of joint venture companies in Asia. It has a 50% stake in AIMS AMP Capital in Singapore, a joint venture REIT management company co-owned with AIMS Financial Group, as well as 15% in China Life AMP Asset Management.

In February 2021, AMP Limited entered into a non-binding Heads of Agreement to investigate the formation of a joint venture with Ares Management. After these plans were cancelled, AMP announced in April 2021 it planned to demerge the business and list it on the Australian Securities Exchange. In April 2022, AMP announced it had dropped this plan and instead sold AMP Capital's real estate and domestic infrastructure equity business to Dexus and international infrastructure equity business to DigitalBridge.


## Accolades

AMP Capital was ranked among the top 10 infrastructure managers globally and was one of the largest real estate managers in Asia as well as providing commercial, industrial and retail property management services. AMP Capital was among the top 6 in Asia for private equity (funds-of-funds) as well as managing investments in fixed income and equities.
