## History

On December 10, 2001, the founder and chief technology officer of Ikanos, Behrooz Rezvani, announced he was editor of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) draft standard for Ethernet in the first mile over copper.

On August 24, 2009 Ikanos acquired Conexant's Broadband Access product line for about $54 million in cash. It also announced an investment of $42 million from Tallwood Venture Capital.

In June 2010, John Quigley replaced Michael Gulett as chief executive (who left in April). He was the fifth CEO in six years.

A U.S. appeals court on May 25, 2012 revived a shareholder lawsuit accusing Ikanos of failing to properly disclose known defects in its semiconductor chips at the time it was conducting a 2006 stock offering.

In August 2015, Ikanos was acquired by Qualcomm Atheros in a deal worth around $47 million, with Qualcomm taking on $20 million of liabilities from Ikanos.
In August 2016 Qualcomm Atheros has closed its recently acquired Ikanos operations.
