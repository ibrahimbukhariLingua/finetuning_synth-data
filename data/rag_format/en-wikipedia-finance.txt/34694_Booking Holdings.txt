## History

In 1996, Jay S. Walker founded the company in Stamford, Connecticut, which launched Priceline.com, an online travel site, that used a Name Your Own Price bidding model.

In 1999, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, making Walker, who owned a 35% stake in the company, a multi-billionaire.

The company experimented with selling other products and services such as groceries, gasoline, home mortgages, and cars, but these offerings were discontinued in 2000.

On April 1, 2014, the name of the company was changed from priceline.com Incorporated to The Priceline Group Inc.

In August 2017, KAYAK acquired the assets of Mundi, a Brazilian metasearch company.

On February 21, 2018, the name of the company was changed from The Priceline Group Inc. to Booking Holdings.

The company offered to acquire GoToGate; however, the deal was blocked by European regulators.
