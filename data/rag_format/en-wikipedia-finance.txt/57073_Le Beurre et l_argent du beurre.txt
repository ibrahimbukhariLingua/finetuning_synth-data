## Synopsis

Fair trading is very much in fashion today. The concept is to help the most underprivileged populations on our planet to emerge from this state thanks to a fairer distribution of revenues. The Shea butter is produced by the poorest women of Burkina Faso, and is more and more appreciated in Europe. It is used in the cosmetic industry and as a cocoa substitute. Various fair trading experiences claim to help them but, who really profits from the money of the butter?
