# Innovacorp



**Innovacorp** is a Nova Scotia crown corporation managing an early-stage venture capital fund. The organization was established under Nova Scotia's Innovation Corporation Act, 1994â€“95, c. 5, s. 1. Its goal is to help early stage Nova Scotia companies commercialize their technologies for export markets. Key industries include information technology, life sciences, clean technology, advanced manufacturing and aerospace.

In May 2010, the organization's High Performance Incubation (HPi) earned an international award for its work from the National Business Incubation Association.

Innovacorp established a yearly technology start-up competition (I3) with a top prize of $100,000. Notable winners include Tether and Xona Games.


## History

Innovacorp, established by a provincial statute, superseded the Nova Scotia Research Foundation Corporation, which was established in 1946 as the Research Foundation of Nova Scotia.


## Investments

Innovacorp investments include companies such as SimplyCast, CarbonCure, GoInstant, SabrTech, Equals6, AioTV, LiveLenz, TruLeaf, DeNovaMed, Airline Employee Travel Inc (GoBumpFree), Proposify and TitanFile.
