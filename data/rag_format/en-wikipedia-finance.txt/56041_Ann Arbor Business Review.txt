Ann Arbor Business Review


# Ann Arbor Business Review



The ***Ann Arbor Business Review*** was a weekly business journal published in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The publication, formerly distributed in a tab format and then primarily on-line, covered business news in the Washtenaw County and Livingston County areas.


## History and profile

The publication started as *Business Direct Weekly* in January 2003 and became *Business Review Washtenaw/Livingston* in late 2004. It changed names again in 2005, becoming the *Ann Arbor Business Review*.

Owned by Advance Publications, it had the same parent company as *The Ann Arbor News*, a daily newspaper. The two publications shared a publisher but were editorially independent. The *Ann Arbor Business Review* drew attention in 2005 when it became the first publication to report that Google was making plans to move its AdWords headquarters to Ann Arbor.

The business journal was part of the Michigan Business Review network, which also included the Novi-based *Oakland Business Review* and the Kalamazoo-based *Western Michigan Business Review*. Following the folding of the *Ann Arbor News* in July 2009 as a daily printed paper, the *Ann Arbor Business Review* ceased its regular printed offering on August 13 and joined the *News* as a primarily on-line publication, sharing the AnnArbor.com website and appearing in the AnnArbor.com print edition each Sunday.
