## Controversy & Fraud

In 2022, Swiftarc Ventures founder Sid Jawahar was ordered to cease and desist from engaging in fraud after it was found that, since September 2019, Swiftarc Capital and Jawahar had been engaging in fraud by overvaluing an illiquid, sizable position owned by the Swiftarc Fund, LP (the “Fund”), which was managed by Swiftarc Capital and Jawahar. As a result of his fraudulent activity, Mr. Jawahar's fund, Swiftarc Capital, LLC, had its investment adviser registration revoked by the Texas Securities Commissioner.

In direct violation of the Texas State Securities Board's order to cease and desist from engaging in fraud, Mr. Jawahar solicited a $1 million investment from an investor only weeks after the order was given. In December 2023, Sid Jawahar was indicted by a grand jury in the U.S. District Court in St. Louis on three counts of wire fraud and one count of investment adviser fraud. In January 2024, Mr. Jawahar was arrested in Miami. He could face up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and up to five years for investment fraud
