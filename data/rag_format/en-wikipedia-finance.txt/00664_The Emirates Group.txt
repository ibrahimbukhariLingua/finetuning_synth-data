## History


### Origins

As the British pulled out of Dubai in the late 1950s, Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum al Maktoum decreed an open seas, open skies, and open trade policy, to develop the country. He also required all government agencies to make a profit. The country was aiming to eliminate its dependence on its finite oil reserves within 50 years.

The Dubai National Air Transport Association (DNATA) was formed in 1959, and by the mid-1980s, it was employing 2,500 employees. It consisted of three business segments: Dnata Airport Operations, Dnata Cargo and Dnata Agencies. In addition to providing support services at Dubai International Airport, the company served as a sales agent for 26 airlines. Dubai had been used as a stopover on routes between Europe and the Far East since the days of Imperial Airways, which landed its flying boats there en route to Australia. The open skies policies kept its airport among the busiest in the Middle East.

During the mid-1980s, Gulf Air began to cut back its services to Dubai. As a result, Emirates was conceived in March 1985 with backing from Dubai's royal family, whose Dubai Royal Air Wing provided two of the airline's first aircraft, used Boeing 727-200/Advs. It was required to operate independently of government subsidies, apart from $10 million in start-up capital. It also leased a new Boeing 737-300 from Pakistan International Airlines which was returned in 1987. Maurice Flanagan was named managing director of the new airline. Formerly of the Royal Air Force, British Airways, and Gulf Air, Flanagan had been seconded to DNATA in 1978 on a two-year assignment as assistant general sales manager.
Chairman was Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, nephew of the Ruler of Dubai, became chairman of Department of Civil Aviation and DNATA itself. Tim Clark joined the management team.

The first flight of the airline was, Dubai-Karachi on 25 October 1985. The airline leased an Airbus 300B4-200, from Pakistan International Airlines. Bombay and Delhi were the next destinations for the airline. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum later gifted two Boeing 727-200s to the airline.

The Emirates Group became profitable within its first nine months. During its first year, the airline carried about 260,000 passengers and 10,000 tons of freight. By 1986, the airline was adding new destinations such as Colombo, Dhaka, Amman, and Cairo to its route network.

In its second year the group posted a loss, but growth continued even as the region was experiencing a downturn a year later. The Gulf War and the laying off of expatriate workers as the main factors. In its second year, competitors had accused Emirates of starting a price war, something the airline's competitors still accuse Emirates of doing. On 3 July 1987, Emirates received its first bought Airbus A310-304, from Toulouse. Within the first 38 months of operating, Emirates was serving 12 destinations.

Emirates Sky Cargo, which operated as a separate entity, carried 25,000 tons of freight in fiscal 1989. Emirates expanded its route network into the Far East in 1990, and expanded its European operations in the summer of 1992. In 1990, the airline purchased three additional Airbus A310-300s from Airbus. The Group also launched Marhaba in December 1991 as a premium meet and greet service for passengers travelling through Dubai International Airport.


### Growth

Emirates airline had become one of the world's fastest growing airlines by the early 1990s. Revenues increased by about $100 million each year, approaching $500 million in 1993. It carried 68,000 tons of cargo and 1.6 million passengers in the same year. The Gulf War had helped Emirates by keeping other airlines out of the area. Emirates was the only airline to continue flying in the last ten days of the war. By the winter of 1991, the Emirates fleet was grounded for several days, as the liberation of Kuwait begun. Operations resumed weeks later.
The airline saw the arrival of another Airbus A300-600R, taking its fleet to nine, Emirates ordered seven Boeing 777s, with an option for seven more, in a US$645.5 million deal in the same year. As the airline celebrated its sixth anniversary, 25,000 passengers a week were being flown to 23 destinations. A year later, Emirates opened their own US$2 million terminal at Dubai Airport.

A partnership agreement with US Airways entered in the fall of 1993 allowed Emirates to offer services around the world. It previously had cooperation agreements with Cyprus Airways. By 1994, the airline was connecting 32 destinations with its 15 aircraft. At this time Emirates was the sixth largest airline in the Middle East.

Emirates took in revenues of $643.4 million in the year ending 30 March 1994. The airline had 4,000 employees and carried two million passengers a year between 34 destinations with a fleet of 18 Airbus aircraft. In spite of the large capital expenditures, the Dubai government had laid out only $50 million since the airline's inception. In October 1995, the Emirates Group launched Mercator an IT company.

A total of 92 air carriers were flying to Dubai Airport and Emirates faced intense competition at its home base. It carried about three million passengers a year to Dubai International Airport in the mid-1990s. Emirates continued to expand during the late 1990s. The growing cargo business accounted for 16 percent of the airline's total revenues. By 1995, it has a fleet flying to 34 locations in the Middle East, Far East and Europe.

The airline also took delivery of six Boeing 777-200s, giving it new long-haul capabilities.

Emirates opened a, $65 million training center in January 1997. The airline was then able to provide simulator training for its crew members and flight and maintenance personnel. A record group profit of AED 371 million was achieved in 1997–98. Emirates executives planned a slowdown in the airline's growth in the late 1990s to stabilize its expansive route network.

In May 1998, Emirates paid the Government of Sri Lanka $70 million for a 40 percent stake in SriLankan Airlines (formerly known as Air Lanka). As part of the deal, Emirates received a 10-year contract to manage SriLankan. In January 2008, Emirates announced that it would give back management of SriLankan Airlines to the Government of Sri Lanka, effective April 2008. Emirates sold its stake in SriLankan Airlines to the Government of Sri Lanka during June 2010.

In 1998, the airline opened a $540 million Terminal 2 at Dubai International Airport, and increased its capacity by 26 per cent as passenger figures hit 3.7 million, while cargo levels went up to 200,000 tonnes. Galileo Emirates (now known as Emquest), was established to consolidate the distribution of the Galileo Reservation System in the existing markets of the UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

In 1999, Emirates opened its own hotel – The Al Dossa Desert Resort. Emirates Group's workforce totaled 11,000 that year, and Dnata entered the South East Asian airport services market with the launch of Dnata Philippines Inc. Emirates SkyCargo also launched a new system called Skychain developed by Mercator, which provided access via the Internet and email to everyone involved in moving a cargo.
