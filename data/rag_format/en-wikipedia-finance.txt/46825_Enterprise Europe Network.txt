Enterprise Europe Network


# Enterprise Europe Network



The **Enterprise Europe Network** is a cross-border business network that provides support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to innovate and grow internationally. It is co-funded by the European Union's COSME and Horizon 2020 programmes.

The network is active in more than 60 countries worldwide and brings together over 3,000 experts from more than 600 member organisations, including chambers of commerce and industry, technopoles, innovation support organisations, universities and research institutes, and regional development organisations.


## History

The Enterprise Europe Network was launched on 7 February 2008 by former EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen, combining the former Euro Info Centres and the Innovation Relay Centres.

From 2008 to 2014, the network was co-financed by the EU's Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), in cooperation with institutions at national and regional levels.

From 2015 to 2020, the network was co-financed under the European Union's programme for the competitiveness of SMEs (COSME) and Horizon 2020.

Under the responsibility of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, the Enterprise Europe Network is managed by the Executive Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (EASME).
