# Trade promotion management

## Business problems addressed

Commonly, companies use their accounting systems or spreadsheets to manage promotions. As the complexity of trade increases software solutions have been developed for consumer goods, food manufacturing, food service and others.

Trade promotion decisions are often rushed and based on sub-par data. While sales and marketing managers are surrounded by promotion information, questions on retail commitment and product forecast accuracy can hinder the process. Multiple data sources and conflicting needs from various departments further complicate the issue.


### Analytics

Historical trade promotion data should be analyzed in order to continually improve trade promotions. If a company does not utilize processes and systems that measure trade promotion performance, future trade promotion executions could be less effective than if theyâ€™d been planned using past analytical information.


### Integration

Lack of integration both internally and with external partners can hinder trade promotion success. Key elements of organizational integration include

* standardized metrics,
* regular information sharing,
* cross-functional department collaboration, and
* collaborative processes.

Integration with retail partners is important to executing promotions successfully, as well as maintain strong relationships with retailers over time.


### Key performance indicators (KPI)

KPIs tell manufacturers and retailers how trade promotions performed relative to their pre-determined objectives. A lack of understanding on what trade promotion data to measure and how to measure performance can hinder the overall process. Manufacturers and retailers will not know what made a promotion effective or ineffective unless they have predetermined data points to measure and analyze.
