## Early life

Ng was born in the then-British Hong Kong in 1959, the youngest of six children. He was part of a wave of Hong Kong students who came to the United States to study in the 1970s, and earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Houston. Ng became a United States citizen in 1988.


## Career

Ng began his career as a Certified Public Accountant with Touche Ross in Houston and Los Angeles. In 1992, Ng became East West Bank's president and CEO. At the time, the bank was a $600 million savings and loan association.

Ng expanded on the bank's original mission of financing underserved Chinese immigrants, growing the bank's business internationally. He leveraged his Asia connections with mainstream American companies and made East West a commercial bank, allowing it to handle international trade financing.

In 1997, Ng engineered East West Bank's sale in a management-led buyout. He became the bank's chairman that same year. The bank's parent entity, East West Bancorp, went public in 1999. During his tenure, East West has bought nine financial institutions. East West doubled its assets after the purchase of its closest competitor, United Commercial Bank, in 2009. The acquisition expanded East West to Atlanta, Boston, New York, and Seattle.

In 2008, Ng expanded the bank's financing into the entertainment industry. *The Hollywood Reporter* named him as one of the top U.S. bankers connecting Hollywood film studios to investors in China, helping to arrange fundraising once investment deals are in place.

Ng's appointment attracted scrutiny from several Republican lawmakers over his connections to China-based organizations. Members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus characterized the scrutiny as racist in nature.
