Management Development Institute was set-up in 1973 as an institute for training, consulting, and research activities. In 1986, Lt. Gen. ML Chibber, a Padma Bhushan, was appointed as its director. The same year, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, along with HRD minister P. Chidambaram visited the MDI campus and discussed with Lt. Gen. ML Chibber about unifying leadership amongst private, public, and government sectors.

Thus, India’s first full-time Executive PGDM program, called ‘National Management Programme (NMP)’ was created with a 15-month curriculum. The core objective of the program was to develop appreciate mindsets across the three sectors and provide opportunity to learn from each other. Additionally, Gandhi conferred the following awards to the program: Prime Minister’s gold medal for topper of the course, Finance Minister’s gold medal for topper in finance, HR Minister’s gold medal for topper in HR, and ITC gold medal for topper in marketing.

The program drew top government officers as well as private sector organisation executives that had the potential to attain top leadership positions. The program, originally restricted to top executives nominated by their organisations, eventually became open for general public applications also, and was MDI’s flagship programme till 1994.

National Management Programme (NMP) was rechristened as ‘Post Graduate Diploma in Management – Business Management’ (PGDM-BM) in 2021, has been open for general applications for Executive PGDM The AICTE-approved program is accredited as a full-time MBA by the Association of MBAs, UK (AMBA) and has been revised for duration (18 months), content, and corporate exposure as well.
