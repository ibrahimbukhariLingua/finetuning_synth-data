## History


### Predecessors and merger

Thermo Electron was co-founded in 1956 by George N. Hatsopoulos and Peter M Nomikos. Hatsopoulos received a PhD from MIT in mechanical engineering and Nomikos was a Harvard Business School graduate. The company focused on providing analytical and laboratory products, and had revenues of over $2 billion in 2004.

Fisher Scientific was founded in 1902 by Chester G. Fisher from Pittsburgh. It focused on providing laboratory equipment, chemicals, supplies and services used in healthcare, scientific research, safety, and education.

On May 8, 2006, Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific announced that they would merge in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange; the merged company was named Thermo Fisher Scientific, and had about 30,000 employees, and reported US$9 billion in combined revenue. On November 9, 2006, the companies announced that the merger had been completed. However, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that this acquisition was anti-competitive regarding centrifugal evaporators, requiring Fisher to divest Genevac. In April 2007, Genevac was sold to Riverlake Partners LLC and the merger closed with FTC approval.

The company's products are sold under the brand names of Thermo Scientific, Fisher Scientific, and several other recognized brand names (e.g. Applied Biosystems, Invitrogen, Patheon, PPD, and Nalgene). According to company figures, as of 2007, 46% of its sales were in life sciences, 20% in healthcare, and 34% in industrial/environmental and safety.

## Controversies


### Xinjiang and Tibet

In February 2019, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced that it would stop selling its equipment in Xinjiang. In June 2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific was reported to sell its equipment to security services in China for use in what was alleged as part of a genetic surveillance program. A report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that Thermo Fisher Scientific collaborated with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security to develop a Huaxia PCR amplification kit specifically to identify the genotypes of Uyghur, Tibetan and Hui ethnic minorities. In June 2021, *The New York Times* reported that, despite bans, Thermo Fisher Scientific equipment continued to be sold to police in Xinjiang.

In 2022, following reports that Thermo Fisher Scientific had sold products to police in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China called on governments to "investigate and suspend commercial activities with companies providing the PRC government with technologies to carry out biometric surveillance in the Uyghur Region, Tibet and elsewhere in the PRC, including the PRC state backed BGI Group and US firm Thermo Fisher." Thermo Fisher Scientific subsequently halted sales of DNA collection kits in Tibet.


### HeLa cells

In October 2021 the estate of Henrietta Lacks sued to get past and future payment for the alleged and widely known unauthorized sale by Thermo Fisher Scientific of her HeLa cells which are essential in many types of research. Over 50 million tons of her cells have been produced and used in over 60,000 scientific studies touching virtually every realm of medicine, including the development of polio vaccines, gene mapping, in-vitro fertilization, and multitudes more.

In May 2022, it was announced Thermo Fisher Scientific went to court to seek a dismissal of the lawsuit. In late July 2023, with the motion to dismiss still outstanding, the court ordered the parties to attend a settlement conference. Soon after that, settlement of the suit, with undisclosed terms, was announced.


### Mexican plant

In 2013, Opengate Capital Group LLC filed suit against Thermo Fisher Scientific for selling it a manufacturing plant controlled by the Gulf Cartel. According to Opengate Capital, the company withheld important documents and pressured employees into concealing the presence of the drug cartel.
