A referendum on the enlargement of the European Communities (EC) was held in France on 23 April 1972. Voters were asked whether they approved of Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom joining the EC, although Norway later voted in its own referendum not to join. The proposals were approved by 68.3% of voters, with a turnout of 60.2%.

The referendum asked: "Do you agree with the new opportunities opening up in Europe, the draft law submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic, and authorising the ratification of the Treaty concerning the accession of United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland and Norway to the European Communities?"

This was the first referendum to be held in any country relating to an issue regarding the European Communities.
