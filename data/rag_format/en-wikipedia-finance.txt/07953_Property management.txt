**Property management** is the operation, control, maintenance, and oversight of real estate and physical property. This can include residential, commercial, and land real estate. Management indicates the need for real estate to be cared for and monitored, with accountability for and attention to its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business.

Property management is the administration of personal property, equipment, tooling, and physical capital assets acquired and used to build, repair, and maintain end-item deliverables. Property management involves the processes, systems, and workforce required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above, including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization, and disposition.

An owner of a single-family home, condominium, or multi-family building may engage the services of a professional property management company. The company will then advertise the rental property, handle tenant inquiries, screen applicants, select suitable candidates, draw up a lease agreement, conduct a move-in inspection, move the tenant(s) into the property and collect rental income. The company will then coordinate any maintenance issues, supply the owner(s) with financial statements and any relevant information regarding the property, etc.


## Roles

This profession has many facets, including managing the accounts and finances of real estate properties and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors, and insurance agencies. Litigation is sometimes considered a separate function set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in their job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law; most commonly, evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager is current with applicable municipal, county, state, and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.
