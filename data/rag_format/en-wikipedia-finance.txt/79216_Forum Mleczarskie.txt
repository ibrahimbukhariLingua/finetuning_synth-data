Forum Mleczarskie


# Forum Mleczarskie



The bi-monthly ***Forum Mleczarskie Handel*** is the oldest Polish business magazine about the dairy products trade. The title was the forerunner of a new kind of trade magazines focusing on category managers (purchasers and sellers) in the modern fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) wholesale and retail trade in Poland. The title is quoted frequently by other Polish media.


## Idea

The title was developed as a reaction of the rapidly changing FMCG trade sector in Poland since 1995. Tens of thousands of former small FMCG shops have been replaced by modern retail chains, which has been followed by a change of professions in this industry: instead of generalists, specialists now rule the day. Such professions – new for Poland – created a demand for business information sources for the FMCG category. Readers of *Forum Mleczarskie Handel* are buyers and sales managers (dairy or fresh products) in headquarters and outlets of wholesale and retail chains like Auchan, Biedronka, Carrefour, E.Leclerc, Lidl, MarcPol, Makro Cash and Carry, Netto, Real, Tesco and others.


## Main editors

First editor-in-chief of the title was Karol Krajewski, a junior professor at Gdynia Maritime University (Akademia Morska w Gdyni), later head of the consulting department to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju Wsi). Since January 2006 Janusz Górski runs the editorial team of all *Forum Mleczarskie*-titles. The editorial advisory board actually has two members: Antoni Pluta, director of the biotechnology department of the Warsaw University of Life Science (Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie) and Maria Andrzej Faliński, president of the Polish trade organization *POHID*.
