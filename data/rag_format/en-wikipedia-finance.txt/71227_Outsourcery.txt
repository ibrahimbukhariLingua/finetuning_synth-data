Outsourcery


# Outsourcery



**Outsourcery Plc**, was a UK-based cloud services provider founded in 2007 by co-CEOs, Piers Linney and Simon Newton. They provided services primarily to small-and-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The company went into administration in June 2016 when most of the business and assets were acquired by GCI Network Solutions Ltd.


## History

Outsourcery's origins date from 1997 when the business initially provided mobile solutions to UK organisations. In 2007, Piers Linney and Simon Newton acquired the business and assets of Genesis Communications – an established business-to-business mobile voice and data reseller. In the same year, Genesis acquired an early stage Microsoft application hosting company, Servelogic Limited, enabling it to enter the hosted services market. Between 2007 and 2010, the company saw revenue for cloud-based services grow from zero to over £4 million and the legacy business was subsequently sold through two transactions during 2011 for a total of £15 million.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ

Along with Linney and Newton, Outsourcery's Board was led by Ken Olisa OBE (non-executive chairman), Andrew Burton (non-executive director) and Jane Hall (non-executive director).

On 24 May 2013, Outsourcery was admitted to London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM). The sale of the legacy mobile distribution business was completed on 3 September 2013.

On 6 November 2013, Outsourcery announced that it had partnered with Dell to design and deploy a secure cloud-based system. The announcement followed Outsourcery's agreement with Microsoft to lead its UK initiative to accelerate the offering of cloud services for the UK public sector, in particular central government.

Outsourcery suspended trading of its stock on AIM, on 3 June 2016, due to its inability to present audited financial results for the year ended 31 December 2015. It stated that "the potential proceeds from the current proposals would potentially leave no or limited value to equity shareholders". Later that month Ernst & Young were appointed as administrators and most of the business and assets were sold to GCI Network Solutions Ltd.


## Organisation and activities

Outsourcery was a member of the Microsoft Cloud OS Network. It was also a founder member of the Cloud Industry Forum (CIF).

Outsourcery's O-Cloud platform was certified to run government classified information at OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL SENSITIVE over the internet. This gave Outsourcery CESG Pan Government Accreditation (PGA) (formerly IL2) and Public Services Network (PSN) Protect (formerly IL3) connectivity to meet data sovereignty and security specifications for the public sector and UK government.

Outsourcery's former co-CEO, Piers Linney, became better known as a 'Dragon' on series 11 and 12 of the BBC Two television programme, Dragons' Den.
