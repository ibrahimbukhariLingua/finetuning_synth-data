He is the company’s longest-serving CEO, after the founder Paul Galvin and his son Bob. An analyst at Northcoast Research noted Brown "...has been a success on many levels. (Motorola Solutions) stock has blossomed, and the company has been transformed completely" during his tenure as CEO.

Brown joined Motorola in January 2003 as head of the communications, government, and industrial solutions sector. In this role, he led the acquisition of Symbol Technologies for $3.9 billion. In 2007 he was promoted to chief operating officer and, in 2008, was named CEO. In 2011 he was named Chairman of the Board.

The company’s three business areas are land-mobile-radio communications (LMR), video security and the command center.
