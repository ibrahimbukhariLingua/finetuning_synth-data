## War service

Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, when Boodai was 17. He joined the Kuwait armed forces in exile, and underwent basic training. Drawing on his fluency in English and Arabic, he went on to work with the US military as a translator.

He was posted to military intelligence with the 18th Airborne Corps operating on the northern border of Saudi Arabia.

After Kuwait was liberated by US-led coalition forces, he was given an officer rank and helped the US Army's host nation affairs unit foster relations with the Kuwaiti population.

Boodai was awarded the US Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service to the US Army during Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait.


## Career

Boodai began his career as deputy manager – International Division of the Securities House, a publicly traded investment firm on the Kuwait stock exchange. He held several roles over the years, working his way up to vice chairman and chief executive, which he held until June 2023.

During his tenure, Boodai founded a US partner firm for Securities House, Global Securities House Ltd, where he developed Shariah-compliant screening tools and managed equity portfolios for Gulf investors.

In 2002, Boodai founded Gatehouse Capital KSCC, a Kuwaiti investment firm, where he led strategic investments in student housing, single family rentals in the US and UK and over US$1.25 billion in US Light Industrial with Brennan Investment Group. Boodai served as Chairman of the organisation from 2016 until June 2023.

In 2007, Boodai co-founded Gatehouse Bank, where he led its restructuring and repositioning into real estate and wealth management in 2011, as well as subsequent restructuring into a digital challenger bank in 2017. Under Boodai's leadership, Gatehouse raised its paid-up capital and secured investments from a sovereign wealth fund.

Boodai is viewed as a pioneering force in the UK's Build to Rent sector. Under his stewardship, Gatehouse Bank launched the first PRS UK Residential Private Rental Scheme Fund with £100 million equity. The success of this first fund led to subsequent partnerships between Gatehouse Bank and TPG Real Estate as well as between Gatehouse Bank subsidiary, Gatehouse Investment Management and The Carlyle Group. In 2021, Gatehouse sold the 918-unit Thistle Portfolio for circa £150 million, which was the largest transaction of its nature in the UK at the time.

In addition to his role as chairman of Gatehouse Bank, Boodai has held the position of chairman of Gatehouse Financial Group since 2015.
