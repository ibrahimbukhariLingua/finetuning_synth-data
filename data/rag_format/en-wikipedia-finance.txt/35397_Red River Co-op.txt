Red River Co-op


# Red River Co-op



**Red River Cooperative Limited**, branded as **Red River Co-op**, is a retail cooperative. A member of Federated Co-operatives, it operates in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.


## Operations

As of 2022, it operates nine Red River Co-op supermarkets, including five in Winnipeg and one each in Gimli, Stonewall, Lorette, and Selkirk. It also operates gas bars and convenience stores throughout the Winnipeg Capital Region and surrounding areas, as well as Northwestern Ontario.


## History

In 1948 Red River Co-op opened their first food stores in Winnipeg.

In 1983, due to poor financial performance they ceased food store operations; they shifted focus on their gas bar operations.

In 2014, when Sobeys acquired Safeway, they were forced to sell 23 locations by the federal Competition Bureau. Federated Co-operatives acquired four locations in Winnipeg and transferred ownership to Red River Co-op. This marked the resumption of food store operations.
