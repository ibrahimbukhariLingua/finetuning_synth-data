# History of Maersk



The **A. P. Moller-Maersk Group** (Danish: ***A.P. Møller-Mærsk Gruppen***) is an international business conglomerate more commonly known simply as **Maersk**. This article concerns the history of the company.

The beginning of the A.P. Møller-Mærsk Group was the shipping company *Dampskibsselskabet Svendborg*, founded by captain Peter Mærsk-Møller and his son Arnold Peter Møller (2 October 1876 – June 1965) in Svendborg, 1904. A.P. Møller had four children, one of whom was Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller. In 1939, he became a partner of the company. After the death of A.P. Møller in June 1965, Mc-Kinney Møller became CEO of the company and had this post until 1993, when he was succeeded by Jess Søderberg. Beginning in 1965, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller also served as company chairman and did not relinquish this position until December 2003 (when he was 90 years old). He was still one of the "managing owners" of the company at the time of his death and was chairman of Odense Steel Shipyard until 2 May 2006.
