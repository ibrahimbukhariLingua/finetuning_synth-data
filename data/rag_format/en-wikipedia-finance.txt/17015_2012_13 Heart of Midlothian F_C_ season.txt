2012–13 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season


# 2012–13 Heart of Midlothian F.C. season



The **2012–13 season** was the 132nd season of competitive football by Heart of Midlothian, and their 30th consecutive season in the top level of Scottish football, competing in the Scottish Premier League. Hearts also competed in the Europa League, League Cup and the Scottish Cup.


## Overview

Hearts finished tenth in the Scottish Premier League. They reached the Play-off Round of the Europa League, the Fourth round of the Scottish Cup and reached the Final of the League Cup losing 3–2 to St Mirren at Hampden.


### Financial problems

The club continued to experience financial problems with some of the senior team not getting paid on time in September. Some players and the management team did not receive there wages in October on time either, which led to the Scottish Premier League (SPL) hitting the club with a transfer embargo. The embargo meant Hearts were unable to sign any players until at least 23 December 2012. In December, the embargo was extended indefinitely as Hearts were deemed to have broken SPL rules by failing to pay a number of bonuses and appearance payments in a timely manner. On 17 January 2013, the embargo was lifted and replaced with signing restrictions until the end of the season, meaning Hearts could only sign players under the age of 21, on less wages and on a one in one out basis.

In early November, the club were subject to a tax tribunal against HMRC over a £1.75m bill. The case centred around the transfer of players on loan from FBK Kaunas and whether tax on the players full earnings should have been paid in the UK rather than in Lithuania where there is a lower rate of taxation. Kaunas paid the large part of the players wages and in doing so paid tax in Lithuania. Shortly after the club was issued with a winding up order over a £449,692.04 unpaid tax bill forcing the club to issue a plea for emergency backing from its fans amid fears Hearts did not have enough funds to continue past their scheduled game against St Mirren on 17 November. Fans were urged to buy match tickets to sell out games and take part in the club's share issue.

n order to fill the shortfall in funds at the club

On 4 May, Hearts released their financial figures for year ending June 2012. Showing that they had made a loss of £1.65 million and debt had been increased slightly to £24.7m. Hearts said that this was due to the HMRC tax liability being reported during this period. They also further reduced operating costs and employment costs. Turnover at the club increased by £1.76m to £8.68m, this was mainly due to player sales and competing in European competition.


## Results and fixtures


### Pre-season / Friendlies


### Scottish Premier League

The fixture list for the first 33 Scottish Premier League matches in the 2012–13 season was announced on 18 June. Hearts were given a home game to start the season against St Johnstone.


### Scottish League Cup

Having qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League, Hearts entered the League Cup at the third round stage. The draw was held on 3 September and the club were drawn against First Division side Livingston, Hearts won the tie 3–1 and progressed to the quarter-final. Hearts went ahead through a deflected goal from Danny Grainger, before Marc McNulty equalised following a defensive mistake. Marius Žaliūkas then scored twice in quick succession to cancel out his earlier error.

Hearts were drawn away to Dundee United for the quarter-final. Callum Paterson opened the scoring before Johnny Russell equalised for the home side, before Hearts had Darren Barr sent off but managed to force the match to extra time. Hearts went on to win the match 5–4 on penalties in a dramatic shoot out, with 14 penalties being taken in total.

The draw for the semi-final took place on 8 November, and Hearts were drawn against fellow Scottish Premier League side Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Andrew Shinnie put the Highlanders ahead shortly after half time, but debutant Michael Ngoo struck the equaliser before Scott Robinson was sent off for a two footed tackle on Inverness player Owain Tudor Jones. The teams could not be separated and the match went to penalties with Hearts going through for the second round in a row, with Philip Roberts missing the last penalty. The result meant Hearts would return to Hampden nine months after lifting the Scottish Cup, and would face either St Mirren or Celtic in the final. The following day St Mirren beat Celtic 3–2 setting up a non Old Firm final. Following completion of the round Inverness asked the Scottish Football Association (SFA) for clarity over whether Hearts player Danny Wilson should have been suspended for the tie, due to speculation over whether he had served a ban from his time at Rangers. The SFA later confirmed that he was eligible and had served the ban when he joined Liverpool in 2010.

Hearts were led into the final by Gary Locke in his first game as the club's official manager, with Andy Webster captaining the side. Hearts went ahead early on through Ryan Stevenson, although their early dominance faltered with Esmaël Gonçalves equalising just before half time. Hearts were struck hard in the second half with Steven Thompson and Conor Newton scoring consecutively to make it 3–1, before Stevenson struck again to make it 3–2. The result meant the cup returned to Paisley for the first time.


### Scottish Cup

Hearts entered the Scottish Cup at the fourth round stage. The draw was conducted on 5 November and drew the cup holders against Edinburgh Derby rival Hibernian, a repeat of the 2012 Scottish Cup Final. The team crashed out the cup, courtesy of an 84th-minute goal from David Wotherspoon. The shot was heavily deflected off Hearts captain Marius Žaliūkas into the net.


### UEFA Europa League

Hearts entered the Europa League during the Play-off round having won the 2011–12 Scottish Cup. The draw took place on 10 August 2012, Hearts were unseeded and were drawn against English Premier League side Liverpool. The tie is the club's second all British affair in two seasons having been drawn against Tottenham Hotspur in the same round the previous season.

## Transfers

Hearts first activity for the new season came with the announcement on 27 April 2012, that David Obua, Aaron Murdoch, Chris Tobin, Ryan Stewart, Colin Hamilton and Matthew Park had not been offered new contracts for the new season. Further announcements followed with the news that Ian Black, Adrian Mrowiec, Stephen Elliott, Gary Glen and Jordan Morton had also not been offered new contracts. On 6 July 2012, it was announced that both Suso Santana and Craig Beattie had turned down new contract offers and would also leave the club. Further departures included Jason Thomson, Chris Kane, Jonny Stewart, Gary Graham and the previous season's top scorer Rudi Skacel.

During pre-season the club brought in Rory Boulding and Anton Peterlin on trial. Neither signed for the club.

John McGlynn's first signing as manager was Finnish international Peter Enckelman, who was brought in as cover following an injury to Mark Ridgers. On transfer deadline day, Ryan Stevenson returned to the club signing a three-year contract, Liam Gordon signed from Raith Rovers and David Smith went the other way on loan. Hearts also accepted an undisclosed bid from Rangers for David Templeton and Ryan McGowan, with the latter opting to stay at Hearts after contract talks with Rangers.

On 3 September, the club signed Alan Combe as a coach but was also registered as a player. He was able to sign out with the transfer window as had been released from his contract with Greenock Morton on the last day of the transfer window. In October free agent Rudi Skacel returned to the club to train, however a deal to re-sign him was stopped by Hearts transfer ban. The club sent three more under-20 players out on loan during the first half of the season, Brad McKay, Callum Tapping and Jack Hamilton.

In December Arturas Rimkevicius was brought in on trial, with a view to signing in January. The deal fell through due to the club's enforced restriction on signing over 21's. On 4 January 2013, with his short-term contract expired Peter Enckelman was released by the club. A Further departure was confirmed on 7 January, with Ryan McGowan completing his move to Chinese club Shandong Luneng Taishan. The club had accepted a £400.000 bid the previous week.
