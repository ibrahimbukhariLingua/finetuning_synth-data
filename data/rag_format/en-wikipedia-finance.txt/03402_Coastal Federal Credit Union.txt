Established in August 1967, Coastal was formed through the efforts of eight employees of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) to meet the financial needs of the local IBM community in Raleigh. In 1991, the field of membership was expanded to include employees of other businesses throughout certain North Carolina areas. Today, Coastal serves employees of more than 1,700 businesses and associations.
