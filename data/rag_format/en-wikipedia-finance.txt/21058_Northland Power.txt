## Conversion to corporation

In 2009, Northland Power Income Fund acquired and merged with Northland Power Inc. This transaction was motivated by the Government of Canada's elimination of preferential tax treatment for income trusts, which has prompted a mass conversion of Canadian income trusts into regular corporations. On June 21, 2010, Northland's unitholders approved management's plan to convert to a corporation effective January 1, 2011.
