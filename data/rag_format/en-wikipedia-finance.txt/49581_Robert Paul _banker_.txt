Robert Paul (banker)


# Robert Paul (banker)



**Robert Paul** was a Scottish banker and church elder that was director of the Commercial Bank of Scotland.

He was born at St. Cuthbert's Manse in Edinburgh on the 15 May 1788. He was educated at the High School and University of Edinburgh. He subsequently entered the Bank of Ramsay, Bonar and Company, Edinburgh, in 1807. Paul was appointed first Accountant to the Commercial Bank of Scotland, which commenced business in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, in 1810 ; Secretary of the Bank 31 July 1823, and Manager 17 December 1835, which office he held till he retired in December 1853. He then became a Director of the Bank, and continued to be so till his death, which took place at Kirkland Lodge, Hermiston, near Edinburgh, 16 July 1866.

A memoir of him was written by his old friend Benjamin Bell, in 1872. He is remembered for his place in the history of Scottish banking and as an influential elder in the lead up to, and the early days of, the Free Church of Scotland. He was the sitter in portraits by Hill & Adamson and by John Watson Gordon.


## Early life and ancestry

Robert Paul was born at Edinburgh on 15 May 1788. His father, William Paul, was Colleague of Henry Moncreiff in the pastorate of the West Kirk, and in 1780 married Miss Susan Moncreiff, Sir Henry's sister. At the time of his father's death, on 27 October 1802, Robert was only fourteen years of age. He had an older brother, William. Robert was younger by two years and they had other younger siblings: Henry (October 1791), Archibald (1792), John (1795), Catherine (1782), Susan (1784), and Catherine Isabella born 13 March 1797.

Having completed his High School and University curriculum, he commenced business life. NatWest says: "In summer 1803 Paul began an apprenticeship in the office of Pitcairn & Scott, writers to the signet. Alexander Pitcairn, one of the firm’s partners, was a friend of the Paul family. Robert Paul was a close friend of Pitcairn’s son David, and regarded Pitcairn himself as ‘my second father’."

They continue: "When Paul’s apprenticeship ended in 1807, Pitcairn arranged a job for him in the private bank Ramsay, Bonars & Co." After he entered the Commercial Bank in one of its subordinate appointments, he rose to be its Manager, which office he held until 1853, when he retired, but became one of the Bank Directors. He married, in 1814, Miss Charlotte Erskine of Aberdona — a union which endured, until 1847, when he was left a widower.


## Other interests

Never a keen party man in State politics, he threw himself into such movements as those connected with Slavery and the Test and Corporation Acts, his sympathies with everything that advanced the cause of freedom leading him to associate himself in these and other questions with the Liberal party. But his available leisure and strength were reserved for Church matters. Hereditarily attached to evangelical opinion as regarded both doctrine and discipline, he had carefully formed his own judgments regarding these matters ; and then he threw himself into the current of affairs which deepened in interest and importance until the Church threw off its State connection in the Disruption of 1843.


## At the Disruption

On 3 June 1843, writing to a distance of the great events of the past weeks, he says, "God will overrule all for His own glory in the advancement of His spiritual church and kingdom."

Mr Paul was ordained an Elder of the West Kirk by Sir Henry Moncreiff in 1816; and it was not until after the Disruption that he became an Elder of St George's. His admiration of Robert Smith Candlish, between whom and himself a very true and tender friendship existed, was great.

While interesting himself in all the needful administrative arrangements consequent on the Church's new condition, he specially identified himself with matters affecting the Theological College and Library and the Educational Schemes of the Free Church generally, associated in these great questions with his much-loved friend David Welsh.

The General Assembly of each year brought round a time which he much enjoyed. His wide acquaintance with Ministers and Elders in all parts of Scotland led him to open his house, to the members who came up to this great annual gathering.

In Assembly business he was constantly consulted. In the Assembly itself, although — owing to a somewhat feeble voice — not a powerful speaker, his presence on the platform elicited respect.

In his latest days the work in which he was most deeply interested was the formation of a Society for aiding the education and business training of the sons and daughters of Ministers and Missionaries of the Free Church.

Among the many benevolent institutions in whose welfare he was interested, and in the management of which he took part, was the Orphan Hospital. From a very early period of life he was one of its Managers, and contributed to lay the foundations of the institution.

His Memoir of the Rev. James Martin, who succeeded Dr Andrew Thomson as Minister of St George's, and his many contributions to the periodical publications of the day, illustrate his literary power. He also wrote a memoir to Dr. Jones published in an appendix to a book on Chalmers. It was published in the same year as his book *The Finest of the Wheat*.

His villa of Kirkland Lodge, near Edinburgh, including its bowling-green, with a view of the Pentlands and the intervening valley, were used by Paul for entertaining guests.


## Last days

In April 1866 the process of physical decline was accelerated, but the mind and heart were fresh. On 22 May, within two months of his death he wrote: "This day the General Assembly meets, and it does seem a strange thing, that instead of being there in the thick of it, I should be here reposing in quiet and comparative solitude."

On the night before he passed away he was carried in his chair to be present at the meeting, which was that night held under Kirkland roof, and the services of which were conducted by his friend the Rev. J. H. Wilson of the Barclay Church. In the early morning of 16 July 1866, he died.
