As Governor, Tošovský participated in drawing up the blueprint for economic reform and in implementing it in the monetary and banking areas.

In response to the political crisis in the Czech Republic at the end of 1997, President Václav Havel appointed Tošovský Prime Minister of the Czech Government.

In August 2007, Russia nominated Tošovský to succeed Rodrigo Rato as head of the International Monetary Fund – as an alternative to the French candidate Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The Czech Republic immediately declared that it would not support Russia's nomination and would continue to stand behind the EU's one.


## State Security allegations

In January 2007, the daily newspaper *Mladá fronta DNES* accused Tošovský of having cooperated with the Czechoslovak State Security.
