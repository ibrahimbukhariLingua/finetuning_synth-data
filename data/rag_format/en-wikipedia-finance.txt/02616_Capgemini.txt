## History

Capgemini was founded by Serge Kampf in 1967 as an enterprise management and data processing company. The company was founded as the *Société pour la Gestion de l'Entreprise et le Traitement de l'Information* (Sogeti).

In 1974, Sogeti acquired Gemini Computer Systems, an American company based in New York. In 1975, having made two major acquisitions of CAP (Centre d'Analyse et de Programmation) and Gemini Computer Systems, and following the resolution of a dispute with the similarly named CAP UK over the international use of the name 'CAP', Sogeti renamed itself as CAP Gemini Sogeti.

Cap Gemini Sogeti launched US operations in 1981, following the acquisition of Milwaukee-based DASD Corporation, specializing in data conversion and employing 500 people in 20 branches throughout the US. Following this acquisition, The U.S. Operation was known as Cap Gemini DASD.

In 1990 Cap Gemini Sogeti acquired the Hoskyns Group, a major IT outsourcing and managed services company in the UK.

In 1996, the name was simplified to Cap Gemini, and the firm launched a new group logo. All operating companies worldwide were re-branded to operate as Cap Gemini.

Ernst & Young Consulting was acquired by Cap Gemini in 2000. It simultaneously integrated Gemini Consulting to form Cap Gemini Ernst & Young. In 2017, Cap Gemini S.A. became Capgemini SE, and its Euronext ticker name similarly changed from CAP GEMINI to CAPGEMINI.

In 2018, they acquired the Philadelphia-based digital customer engagement company LiquidHub for US$500 million to assist Capgemini's digital and cloud growth in North America. Earlier Capgemini acquisitions included Kanbay for $1.2 billion and iGate for $4 billion.

In 2019, Capgemini acquired Altran, the largest acquisition in the company's history, bringing the total employee count to over 250,000. As part of the acquisition, Capgemini acquired frog design and Cambridge Consultants, which were integrated into Capgemini Invent; several other recent acquisitions in the design and digital space, including staff from Fahrenheit 212, Idean, and June21, have been merged into this group and operate under the frog brand.

## Capgemini and the public sector in France

In December 2022, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company was alleged, amongst other accusations, to have benefitted in France from special access and favorable government treatment, including the awarding of lucrative government contracts. The French media dubbed the scandal the "McKinsey Affair". Subsequently, a French Senate Committee of Inquiry investigated the growing influence of private consulting firms on public policy.

In February 2022 Senator Éliane Assassi questioned each consulting firm on their activities on specific projects. She raised in particular the case of a former employee of the Capgemini group, who had been appointed as head of the Elysée correspondence service. The service subsequently contracted Capgemini to reorganize its digital tools, with the aim of setting up a system to automate mail reading to produce reports. "Is it not embarrassing, from your point of view, that a former employee of Capgemini is responsible for reviewing the correspondence service of the Élysée?", the senator asked. "It is not up to us to have an opinion on who, within the client organization, triggers this type of service", replied Mathieu Dougados, executive director, and he suggested the commission ask the Élysée.

Etienne Grass, director of public sector activities at Capgemini also participated. He was a former classmate of Emmanuel Macron (French president at the time of the scandal), and former chief of cabinet of a government minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem. Etienne Grass commented: "In principle, our employees are not intended to be recruited", and for good reason: "when it happens, it puts us in a complex situation", he admitted. However, the firm makes an exception vis-à-vis the State, by not applying certain contractual clauses which prevent an employee from joining a client, "provided that an ethical framework has been fixed", the director underlined.

In June 2022, *Le Monde* published a survey of the significant lucrative projects carried out by Capgemini for the French public sector entitled "Consulting firms: Capgemini, the expensive service provider that the State can no longer do without". The name of Etienne Grass, head of the "public sector" market unit of Capgemini Invent since 2017, was mentioned.
