## History

In 1991, over 19,000 gallons of metam sodium manufactured by Amvac Chemical Corporation spilled from a train derailment into Shasta Lake. AMVAC settled resulting lawsuits for $2 million while Southern Pacific Transportation Company paid $30 million in settlements.

In 2001, AMVAC began producing the herbicide DCPA (Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate, trade name Dacthal) for the American market.

In 2007, Amvac paid $300,000 in a pre-trial settlement with six workers who were exposed to dibromochloropropane (DBCP) on a Dole Food Company-operated banana plantation in the 1970s.

In 2017, the company acquired the US rights to abamectin, Chlorothalonil, and paraquat from ADAMA Agricultural Solutions.

In 2018, the company acquired the US and Canada Bromacil business from Bayer Crop Science.

In August 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an emergency order to immediately remove DCPA from the market.
