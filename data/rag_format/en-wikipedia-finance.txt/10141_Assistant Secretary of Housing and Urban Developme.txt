## Assistant Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development for Housing

At the founding of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1965, one Assistant Secretary role was specifically designated to perform the functions of the existing role of Federal Housing Commissioner. HUD Secretary George W. Romney split the role between two new titles, **Assistant Secretary for Housing Production and Mortgage Credit** (HPMC, for the production side of Sections 235 and 236 and public housing), combining the GHA Commissioner role, and a separate **Assistant Secretary for Housing Management** (HM). Finally, on June 16, 1976, HUD Secretary Carla Hills merged the two roles into one single **Assistant Secretary for Housing & Federal Housing Commissioner** role, which remains the title today.
