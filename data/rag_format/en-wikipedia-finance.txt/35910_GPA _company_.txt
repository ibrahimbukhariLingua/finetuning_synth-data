## History

In 1948, the immigrant Portuguese Valentim dos Santos Diniz opened a confectionery in São Paulo, which he named Pão de Açucar ("Sugarloaf Mountain") in memory of the first landscape he saw of Brazil when he arrived by boat (the Sugarloaf Mountain is a rocky peak that dominates Rio de Janeiro).

For 2013, the company planned to open more than 150 stores, targeting northeast and mid-west regions.

In September 2013, Abílio Diniz, the son of the company's founder, stepped down as chairman of the company.

In 2024, Casino reduces its stake to 22.5%.
