## Allegations

While at Infosys, two women filed lawsuits against Murthy. Despite Murthy strongly denying the accusations throughout proceedings, the lawsuits were settled out of court and he subsequently departed from Infosys.

In 2013, another lawsuit was labeled against Murthy by a subordinate employee. Murthy denied all the charges. An internal investigation showed that Murthy failed to report his relationship with the employee but didn’t violate the sexual harassment policy of the company. Despite this, iGate terminated its contract with Murthy.

In December 2013, Murthy sued iGate, contesting the basis of terminating his employment contract. He argued that iGate knew about his relationship with the subordinate employee and improperly used the reporting policy to terminate him. He also claimed that iGate withheld vested stocks due to him that were worth $17 million.
