### Development

The group has completed developments of more than 2 million m² of office, residential and retail space in Europe. Several high-rise buildings in the Northern Quarter, the central business district of Brussels, were developed by AG Real Estate. The Northern Quarter is characterized by high-rise buildings, most around 100 meters tall, including The Botanic Tower, AG Real Estates' former headquarters building. Over half of the twenty tallest buildings in Belgium are located in the Northern Quarter.

Their activities are focused on different areas: Urban Renewal, Sustainable communities, Turnkey Projects and Public-Private Partnerships.

Since 2008, AG Real Estate is involved in several PPP projects, including a leading role in the fast-track nl:Scholen van Morgen (Schools of Tomorrow) initiative. ‘Schools of Tomorrow’ is a public-private partnership (PPP) in charge of the design, build and finance of 182 school infrastructure projects (comprising 250 buildings) in the Flanders, the Northern Region of Belgium. With construction of most projects scheduled for completion by the end of 2016, the program also includes the maintenance of all constructions and technical installations during the first 30 years of use, after which the ownership is transferred to the individual schools at no cost.
