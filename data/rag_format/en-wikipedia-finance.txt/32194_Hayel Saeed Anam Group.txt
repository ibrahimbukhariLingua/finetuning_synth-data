Hayel Saeed Anam Group


# Hayel Saeed Anam Group



The Hayel Saeed Anam & Co. (Arabic: هائل سعيد أنعم وشركاه) is a multi-billion dollar conglomerate active in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and South East Asia. The group is owned and managed by the Saeed Anam family. The group today has grown to own over 92 companies in various regions, including Yemen, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, United Kingdom, Kenya, and Nigeria.


## History

The history of the group dates back to 1938, when Hayel Saeed Anam and his brothers, Mohamed Saeed An'am, Abdu Saeed Anam, and Jazem Saeed Anam founded a retail store in Aden, Yemen. Five years later, they founded an import and export company based in Aden which paved the way for their growing business. In 1950, they expanded their business in Northern Yemen through opening stores in Mocha, Taiz, Hudaydah and Aden and after 2 years the company was incorporated as Hayel Saeed Anam and Partners. The group extended their business through several regions. In 1977 they launched the starting point for investment in Europe by setting up the group's first trade and industrial company in the UK. In 1987, their business expanded even in the Arab region as they launched a National Biscuits and Confectionery Company in Saudi Arabia. Following the death of the founder Hayel Saeed Anam in 1990, the group continued his legacy by launching many more initiatives across different regions. In 1992, the group launched an Establishment of cooking oil and gee in Egypt. In 1999, HSA Group launched one of the biggest plants of oil refining in Indonesia. In 2006, the group established The General Trading of Agro commodities Midstar FZE in the UAE.


## Criticism

In 2018, Greenpeace claimed to have documented large scale deforestation in areas, which have been given an extra level of legal protection from deforestation and are controlled by subsidiaries of the Hayel Saeed Anam Group (Arma Foods and Pacific Oils and Fats). Following these accusations, Unilever suspended placement of any new orders from HSA's Group subsidiaries until the allegations have been satisfactorily addressed by them. The allegations were not sustained or proved as per the RSPO, hence the Greenpeace's claim of Complaint was closed and resolved as of 2022.


## Reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak

The International Initiative on COVID-19 in Yemen (IICY) was founded, amongst others, by the charity arm of the HSA Group with the goal to improve the limited testing capabilities for the SARS-CoV-2 in Yemen. The IICY said in a statement that the first 34-tonne shipment contained 49,000 virus collection kits, 20,000 rapid test kits, five centrifuges and equipment that would enable 85,000 tests, and 24,000 COVID-19 nucleic acid test kits. The air-borne shipment arrived in Yemen on 19 June 2020.

Working with UN and its agencies, IICY partners have donated money to fund the salaries of frontline medical workers and delivered much-needed medical equipment including PPE which has been distributed to hospitals and laboratories across Yemen.ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ
