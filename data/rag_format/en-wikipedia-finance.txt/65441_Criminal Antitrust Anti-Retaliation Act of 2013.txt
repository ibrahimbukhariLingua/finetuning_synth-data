# Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013



The **Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013** (S.Â 42) is a bill that would protect whistleblowers who report violations of United States antitrust law. The bill would have whistleblowers first file a retaliation claim with the United States Department of Labor before going to federal court. The bill passed the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress.


## Background

The bill was written in response to a July 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office on whistleblowing and price fixing.


## Provisions of the bill

*This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.*

The Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act of 2013 would prohibit discharging or in any other manner discriminating against a whistleblower in terms and conditions of employment because: (1) the whistleblower provided information to the employer or the federal government concerning a violation of antitrust law or another criminal law committed in conjunction with a potential violation of antitrust law; or (2) the whistleblower participated in, or otherwise assisted, an investigation relating to such a violation.

The bill would allow a whistleblower who alleges discharge or other discrimination to seek relief: (1) by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor; or (2) if the Secretary has not issued a final decision within 180 days of filing such complaint, to bring an action at law or equity.

The bill would entitle a whistleblower who prevails in any such action to all relief necessary to make such whistleblower whole.
