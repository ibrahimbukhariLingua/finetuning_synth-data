Pass-through (economics)


# Pass-through (economics)



In economics, **cost pass-through** (also known as **price transmission** or simply *pass-through*) is a process (or result) of a business changing pricing of its output (products or services) to reflect a change in costs of its own input (materials, labor, etc.). The effect of passthrough is quantified as **passthrough rate**, a ratio between the change in costs and the change in prices. Depending on circumstances, a business might choose to absorb part of the cost changes (resulting in ratio below 1.0) or amplify them (ratio above 1.0).

Cost pass-through is extensively used when analyzing the state of competition or evaluating mergers. In the studies of inflation, an opposite direction **pass-through from prices to wages** is also considered, as well as both occurring together (wage-price spiral).


## Simple examples

When an increase in costs (the *cost shock*) happens in a perfectly competitive market, a bigger share of the change will be borne by the party that is less sensitive to the price.

For example, in the perfectly inelastic demand case (consumers have to have the good whatever the price is), a cost shock will be passed to consumers in its entirety (*full pass-through*, passthrough rate will be equal to 1.0). In the case of a perfectly elastic demand (consumers ready to abandon the market if faced with any price increase), producers will be forced to fully absorb the shock (pass-through rate 0.0).

In the intermediate case of consumers being somewhat price-sensitive, the demand for goods will be reduced; the ultimate pass-through effect will be dependent on the slope of the supply curve. If it slopes upwards (the more units are produced, the costlier each one is, e.g., due to capacity constraints), the per-unit costs will go down, providing the producer with some room to partially absorb the cost shock. If the supply curve slopes downward (case of economy of scale), reduced production will make each unit costlier to produce, so the pass-through rate can become higher than 1.0 (so called *over-shifting*).
