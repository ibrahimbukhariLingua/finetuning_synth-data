Corporate dissolution


# Corporate dissolution



**Corporate dissolution**, also known as **corporate wind-down**, refers to the formal process of closing a business entity. This involves ensuring all legal, financial, and operational obligations are settled before the company ceases to exist. While forming a company can be straightforward, dissolving one is often complex and time-consuming, frequently requiring specialist assistance.
