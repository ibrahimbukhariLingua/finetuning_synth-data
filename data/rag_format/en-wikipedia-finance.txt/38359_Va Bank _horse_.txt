In July he won Nagroda Prezesa Totalizatora Sportowego with a time of 2'44.70. On July 30, he won Nagroda Kozienic with a 4 1/2 length advantage over Newerly. On August 27, he started abroad for the first time. He was enrolled in the Preis der Sparkassen Finanzgruppe G3 at the Baden Baden racetrack in Germany. It was ridden by Martin Siedl. The favorite was Potemkin, the highest ranked horse in the German handicap. Va Bank beat him by 1 1/2 lengths. It was his 12th consecutive victory, which is a Polish record. After the race, Martin Siedl said: "Thank you for the trust and the opportunity to ride. I will gladly accept more offers! He is a great horse, very easy to ride. You give him a signal and he responds. In my sights I had the impression that he still had reserves. I was able to show him the way to victory and he just did it." Soon after, it was announced that Team Valor International had purchased a 50% stake. He took part in Nagroda Wielka Warszawska for the second time. His biggest rival was Caccini, the winner of Derby 2016. Va Bank was ridden by Marek Brezina. Caccini won in style from wire to wire. Va Bank was second 1/2 length behind him. Experts blamed the stallion's failure on too short a period between the victory in Germany and the start in Nagroda Wielka Warszawska, and the tactically bad driving of Marek Brezina. Maciej Janikowski commented: "The course of the competition itself, from my perspective, left much to be desired, but after the race everyone is smart. In my opinion, Va Bank was not the same horse as in previous starts, because if he was, he would have managed, even though the race was not the best for him. Perhaps his body did not have time to fully regenerate after the effort associated with the victorious race in Baden-Baden and the several-hour return journey. When I saw him for the first time after arriving, it struck me that that he clearly "went out of his body". After several days he returned to normal condition and training work, but it is possible that the last three weeks were not enough for him to fully recover mentally and physically".


### 2017: five-year-old season

Va Bank started training Andreas Wohler in Germany. Stallion finished fourth in the Preis von Dahlwitz Listed before finishing last in the Grosser Preis der Badischen Wirtschaft G2. After the race, he was diagnosed with microcracks in the articular cartilage.
