**Brighter** is a Santa Monica-based internet and healthcare company that connects dentists, patients, and dental insurers. The company licenses a consumer-driven dental benefits experience to insurance carriers to help them administer dental plans more efficiently and offer patient-friendly services such as online and mobile provider directories, patient reviews, and a proprietary online appointment scheduling feature, Brighter Schedule. The company's founder and CEO is internet entrepreneur Jake Winebaum.

Brighter's technology powers member engagement tools used by major dental insurers including Cigna, Aetna, and Delta Dental.

In December 2017, Brighter was acquired by Cigna.


## Early products

The company's first product was a dental savings plan geared toward uninsured patients. It was profiled in several national publications, including Good Morning America, ABC World News with Diane Sawyer, The Los Angeles Times, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, Reuters, and TechCrunch.

In 2014, the company launched Brighter PRO, a dental benefit plan for self-funding companies. Companies use self-insured preferred-provider (PPO) dental plans, with access to an online platform to search for local providers, compare, and select a dentist.
