## Controversy

CERAWeek's list of controversial speakers has drawn protests over accusations of greenwashing and environmental injustice.

Despite the conference's front-page claim to " advance new ideas, insight, and solutions to the biggest challenges facing the future of energy, the environment, and climate," CERAWeek's 2025 speakers list includes many oil & gas CEOs embroiled in controversy.
