## History

In 1997, Craig Bowen and his wife, Esther Diez launched an online gift business, which they started from their apartment in Key West, Florida in 1997.

In 1997, Yahoo! gave GiftTree the opportunity to be the "featured merchant" during the holidays. This generated publicity and backing from other websites. GiftTree was moved to Vancouver, Washington in 1998.

Bowen and Diez planned to sell GiftTree during the dot-com boom, but their profits allowed them to continue owning the company. Since 2001, the company has received a yearly profit. In 2005, GiftTree had thirty-five employees; by 2007, the company expanded the number off employees to sixty. During the holidays, GiftTree employs an additional 80 people. Martin McClanan, former C.E.O. of Red Envelope, became C.E.O. in 2015.


## Revenue

In 2007, GiftTree, on average, received 17,000 gift orders every month. In 2004, they received half of this amount. The company's 2007 revenue was $20 million.
