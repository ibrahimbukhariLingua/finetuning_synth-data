Ministry of Finance (Saudi Arabia)


# Ministry of Finance (Saudi Arabia)



The **Ministry of Finance** (**MoF**; Arabic: وزارة المالية) of Saudi Arabia is the principal body for controlling state expenditure in Saudi Arabia. It is currently led by Mohammed Al-Jadaan.


## History

When instructions were issued by the Kingdom of Hejaz that financial matters were to be managed by a finance directorate, a single entity in the form of a General Directorate of Finance was established on 14 October 1927. Royal Order No. 381 was issued on 14 May 1932 changing the name of the General Directorate of Finance to the Ministry of Finance, thus becoming the second ministry to be established after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Finance was tasked with regulating, managing and securing the collection of state funds, and oversight of expenditures, and became the general authority for financial matters in the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd and its territories. Royal Decree No. 1697 was issued on 27 June 1953 establishing the Ministry of Economy to replace the Bureau for Economic Affairs. Royal Decree No. 31 was issued on 4 September 1954 merging the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance into a single ministry called the Ministry of Finance and National Economy. Royal Order No. 2/A was issued on 1 May 2003 transferring responsibility for economic activity from the above-mentioned ministry to the Ministry of Planning, thus changing the name of the Ministry of Finance and National Economy to the Ministry of Finance, and the name of the Ministry of Planning to the Ministry of Economy and Planning.

The Ministry owns the Istidama Holding Company, which on 23 April 2018, received the 36.2% stake of the Saudi Binladin Group owned by Bakr bin Laden and his brothers Saleh and Saad.
