San Francisco Centre


# San Francisco Centre



**San Francisco Centre** is a shopping mall located in San Francisco, California, United States. It is anchored by Bloomingdale's, which is set to close in late spring 2025. There is one vacant anchor that was formerly a Nordstrom. It connects directly to the Powell Street station via an underground entrance on the concourse floor.


## History


### Early years

Originally developed by Sheldon Gordon (co-developer of The Forum Shops at Caesars and Beverly Center), the nine-story mall opened in October 1988 as **San Francisco Shopping Centre** with approximately 500,000 square feet (46,000 m²) of space, the then-largest Nordstrom store (350,000 square feet (33,000 m²)) on the top several floors, the first spiral escalator in the United States, and a connector to the adjoining Emporium-Capwell flagship store.

After a slow start, it soon became one of the top-performing shopping centers in the country. In 1996, the adjoining Emporium (it had dropped the Capwell name by then) was shuttered in the wake of Federated Department Stores' buyout of its parent, Broadway Stores. The vacated store was temporarily used as a Macy's furniture store while it renovated its Union Square flagship in 1997.

In May 1997, Urban Shopping Centers, Inc., a real estate investment trust, acquired a half-interest and management of the center. This was followed by Urban's own buyout by Rodamco North America N.V. (a European property firm primarily invested in the United States) in October 2000 and Rodamco's subsequent sale to a consortium including the Westfield Group in January 2002. Westfield acquired its initial 50% stake in the center at this time and soon bought the rest.


### Expansion

In February 2003, Forest City, which had acquired redevelopment rights to the long-vacant Emporium store from Federated, reached an agreement with Westfield to jointly redevelop the two properties.

The newly expanded mixed-use **Westfield San Francisco Centre** opened on September 28, 2006. Designed by the Kohn Pedersen Fox architectural firm, with Kevin Kennon as the Design Principal, the mall included Bloomingdale's West Coast flagship store, a nine-screen Century Theatres multiplex theater featuring 2 XD screens, a 30,000 square feet (2,800 m²) Bristol Farms gourmet supermarket, and the Downtown Campus for San Francisco State University in its 1.5 million+ ft² of space.

The redevelopment cost $440 million. Only the front façade and landmark dome of the original structure were preserved; the rest of the structure was completely gutted and replaced. Upon completion of the project, Forest City became an equity partner and along with Westfield assumed responsibility for day-to-day management. In March 2009, it was announced that Westfield San Francisco Centre shopping center was named as one of nine finalists vying for the title of “World’s Best Shopping Center” as part of the *International Council of Shopping Centers Inc.’s* inaugural “Best-of-the-Best” awards. Westfield San Francisco Centre ended up winning the "Best-of-the-Best" award for design and development; it was one of only four shopping centers in the world to win.

In 2011, the San Francisco Police Department considered putting a substation in the mall to prevent rampant shoplifting.

The Bristol Farms store closed on January 27, 2017. In the summer of 2021, a Shake Shack opened in the former Bristol Farms space.


### Decline

In June 2023, Westfield and Brookfield announced that, due to plunging post-pandemic sales, occupancy and foot traffic at the mall, they would stop making loan payments and cede the property to their lenders. The Century Theatres multiplex closed on June 15, 2023. In July 2023, the Westfield branding was removed from the mall, which was renamed **San Francisco Centre**. Nordstrom closed on August 27, 2023, leaving Bloomingdale's as the only anchor store, at which point the mall's occupancy level had fallen to 55%. Mayor London Breed suggested that the mall could be redeveloped for another use, such as a soccer stadium, while others suggested it be used as food halls, pickleball courts, and animal shelters.

In September 2023, the owners of the American Eagle store filed a lawsuit claiming mall management had failed to "maintain the Common Areas at the mall which has poisoned public opinion" about safety.

In October 2023, Gregg Williams, the principal receiver of Trident Pacific (a receivership firm), was appointed by a judge to take possession, custody, and control of the mall.

By November 2023, and into early 2024, many stores had begun to close at the mall. This includes LEGO, two-level Adidas, Hollister, Aldo, Madewell and sister chain J.Crew, and Lucky Brand. The mall's occupancy level fell to only 25%, and its valuation had plunged 75% from its 2016 level of $1.2 billion to only $290 million.

On February 29, 2024, San Francisco Centre was renamed **Emporium Centre San Francisco,** then in October, eight months after announcing the new name, management reverted back to the original **San Francisco Centre** name.

Throughout 2024, more stores continued to close as a result of decline, this time L'Occitane, Sephora, American Eagle, and Ted Baker. When American Eagle closed, with over three years remaining on its lease, it sued the mall's receivers, alleging that the building was not being maintained, leading to vermin and crime problems within the mall. The receiver threatened to countersue the store for breaking its lease. AE had already sued Westfield the previous year, alleging they had allowed the mall to decay as well. A foreclosure auction was scheduled for November 14. In January 2025, the mall's Michael Kors store closed.

On January 21, 2025, Macy's, Inc. announced that the Bloomingdale's anchor store would close in spring 2025. If the closure proceeds as scheduled, it will leave the mall without any anchor stores.


## Layout

The shopping center is nine stories tall and is integrated into nearby buildings anchored by Bloomingdale's, with one vacant anchor previously occupied by Nordstrom, which closed in late August 2023. The basement level is directly connected to two entrances for Powell Street station, which is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Muni Metro trains. The mall's owners paid $750,000 annually to BART to maintain access to the station.
