## Current operations


### Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison

H3I launched its commercial services on 29 March 2007 under the 3 brand.

Indonesia is an extremely attractive wireless market with a sizable population and a relatively low mobile penetration rate. It is an excellent example of Hutchison Telecom's vision and strategy in achieving growth in emerging markets.

At the end of September 2009, H3I's customer base grew to approximately 7.3 million.

In September 2021, it was announced that the latter company would be merged with Ooredoo's Indosat (who operates IM3 Ooredoo networks) to form Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH) and was closed the merger on 4 January 2022.

### Vietnamobile

In February 2005, Hutchison Telecom was granted an investment licence by the government for the project and in January 2007, launched CDMA service under the brand HT Mobile.

While they offered a superior network, the market uptake was greatly hampered by the lack of affordable CDMA handsets, in particular, those with the Vietnamese language option, coupled with the trend of leading manufacturers to scale back handset development for this market.

On 8 March 2008 they received government approval to convert from CDMA technology to GSM. After the successful conversion, it launched GSM services in April 2009 under the new brand "Vietnamobile".
