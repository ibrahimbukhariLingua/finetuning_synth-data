Renovo plc


# Renovo plc



**Renovo Group plc** was a biopharmaceutical company, which was founded in 1998 and was headquartered in Manchester, United Kingdom. It worked in the discovery and development of drugs to reduce scarring, improve wound healing and enhance tissue regeneration. Renovo does not currently have any marketed products. It aimed "to be first to market with a scar prevention pharmaceutical drug in the US and Europe" in approximately 2014. Following the failure of its last clinical candidate Juvista, all 100 of Renovo's staff were laid off in 2011.

Although the company stopped all pharmaceutical development it continued as a financial provider. In August 2014, Renovo Group plc was renamed **Inspired Capital plc**.
