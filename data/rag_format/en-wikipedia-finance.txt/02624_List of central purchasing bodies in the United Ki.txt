List of central purchasing bodies in the United Kingdom


# List of central purchasing bodies in the United Kingdom



This is a list of **central purchasing bodies** serving public sector procurement in the United Kingdom. Central purchasing bodies are also known as "Public Buying Organisations" (PBOs). In May 2010 the National Audit Office estimated that there were just under 50 public buying organisations in the UK.


## Background

A "central purchasing body” is defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as "a contracting authority which provides centralised purchasing activities and which may also provide ancillary purchasing activities". The role of a central purchasing body, as defined in Regulation 37 of the regulations, is to support "the acquisition of supplies or services, or both, intended for contracting authorities", and "the award of public contracts or the conclusion of framework agreements [or dynamic purchasing systems] for works, supplies or services intended for contracting authorities". The definitions are derived from Articles 2(1)(14) and 37 of the European Union's Directive on Public Procurement, Directive 2014/24/EU, transposed into UK legislation in 2015. Similar organisations can be found in other EU Member States, for instance Hansel Ltd. in Finland and Consip in Italy.

The EU rules provide that a contracting authority may use the services of a central purchasing body located in another Member State, and should do so in accordance with the national procurement rules which apply where the central purchasing body is located.

In the UK, central government organisations are required by HM Treasury guidance to use the Government Procurement Service (Crown Commercial Service) in its capacity as a central purchasing body.


## Organisations

* Advanced Procurement for Universities and Colleges (APUC), established in 2007, provides central procurement services and expertise for the universities and colleges of Scotland. APUC is based in Stirling.
* Crescent Purchasing Consortium (CPC), established in 1999, owned by the UK further education sector since 2009, and based in Salford, offers framework agreements for the education sector, including colleges, schools and multi-academy trusts. CPL Group, the parent company of the CPC, was recognised as a 'great place to work' by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2021.

* Crown Commercial Service (CCS), part of the Cabinet Office, claims to be "the biggest public procurement organisation in the UK".
* Department for Education, operates framework agreements used to procure "traditional" school and public building construction works and for offsite construction.
* Devon County Council: Devon led a consortium of public bodies responsible for a framework agreement known as "Construction Framework South West" (CFSW).
* ESPO, formally the Eastern Shires Purchasing Organisation, is a public sector-owned professional buying organisation established in 1981. It operates from a purpose-built warehouse and head office based in Leicester, England, adjacent to the M1, with a distribution centre in South Wales, and is owned and managed by six English local authorities: Leicestershire County Council, Lincolnshire County Council, Cambridgeshire County Council, Norfolk County Council, Warwickshire County Council, and Peterborough City Council. ESPO is one of four organisations which serve the local authorities of England and Wales, along with the Yorkshire Purchasing Organisation, North Eastern Purchasing Organisation and the Central Buying Consortium. A fifth consortium, West Mercia Supplies (WMS), now called *Consortium Education*, was based in the West Midlands but after being purchased by a private sector company it lost its status as a public sector consortium. The five consortia collectively operated under the name *Pro5*, until WMS ceased to be part of the public sector. "ESPO" is the trading name of a joint committee of these six local authorities established under the Local Government Act 1972 (section 101 (5) and section 102) and section 9EB of the Local Government Act 2000. Initially its purpose was to serve Leicestershire and Lincolnshire as a joint initiative.
* EN:Procure Ltd. is a consortium consisting of four South Yorkshire Councils – Sheffield City Council, Doncaster Council, Rotherham Council and Barnsley Council, and 4 South Yorkshire ALMOs – Sheffield Homes, Rotherham 2010, Berneslai Homes (Barnsley) and St Leger Homes (Doncaster).

The claimed savings resulting from collaborative use of its frameworks were less than its set-up and running costs. DCLG concluded in 2009 that it would be cost-effective to maintain Firebuy in operation, but it closed on 13 July 2011.
