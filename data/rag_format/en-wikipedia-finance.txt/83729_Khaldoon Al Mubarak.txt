## Career

Al Mubarak has worked for the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, and the UAE Offsets Group. He was executive vice-president-corporate of Dolphin Energy.

Al Mubarak has interests in mining projects in South America, specifically in Colombia, as he directs the state-owned Mubadala Investment Group, the company that owns Minesa, a company created in 2013 to obtain the exploitation license, from the Colombian government, to extract gold from the Páramo de Santurbán, Soto Norte province, Santander department, with reserves calculated in the subsoil of approximately 9 million ounces. There has been fierce opposition from environmentalists and political leaders in the region due to the threat posed by the contamination of the water reserve that nourishes more than 4 million inhabitants, a product of possible mismanagement that Minesa gives to the cyanide and mercury residues necessary to extract the gold as well as the destruction of the páramo ecosystem, becoming even a matter of national and international interest. However, the investment made in the country during the 2010s, seeking the favor of the government and productive sectors of the country in favor of the exploitation of the páramo, is being put at risk as Minesa's request is filed by the National Environmental Licensing Authority (ANLA), declaring deficient the Environmental Impact Study in the area made by the mining company. After an appeal process by Minesa, the ANLA ordered in January 2021 the final file of the environmental license for the mining megaproject.

## Sport


### Motorsport

Al Mubarak, as chairman of the Abu Dhabi Motor Sport Management Company (ADMM), worked to bring auto racing to the region and negotiated the deal with FIA for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula One motor race. The deal was officially announced in early 2007 at the Abu Dhabi F1 Festival in the UAE.


### Football

In early September 2008, and after negotiations led by Dubai-born businessman Sulaiman Al-Fahim on behalf of the Abu Dhabi side, the owners of English Premier League football club Manchester City, including chairman Thaksin Shinawatra, agreed to sell the entirety of their shares to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. On Tuesday 23 September 2008, the deal was concluded and the shares were transferred to Abu Dhabi United Group, a United Arab Emirates-based private equity firm owned by Sheikh Mansour, in a deal that was both welcomed and questioned by some observers. In September 2008, the new owner appointed Al Mubarak as chairman of the board of directors of the club, with Garry Cook as Chief Executive. Cook would later resign in 2011 and be replaced by Ferran Soriano.

On 14 May 2011, City won the FA Cup, their first silverware after a drought of 35 years, by beating Stoke City 1–0 in the final. On 13 May 2012, with two goals scored in stoppage time in the last game of the season, played at their home stadium, and amidst "scenes of near bedlam", Manchester City were crowned champions of the Premier League, winning the top-division title for the first time since the 1967–68 season. The club's finances reached a loss of £98 million in 2011–12 but improved to show an £11 million profit in 2014–15, and then in the 2015–16 season a profit of £20.5 million with "record" revenues of £398.1 million.

Since 2013, Mubarak has been the chairman of City Football Group, a holding company that invests in and manages various international football-related businesses, including Manchester City, New York City, Mumbai City and Melbourne City. In 2019, the City Football Group decided under his leadership to sell a 10% stake to Silver Lake for $500 million.


#### Controversies

A decade after the UAE acquired Manchester City, documents by Football Leaks revealed that the Abu Dhabi owner and chairman together circumvented the Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, which were introduced by UEFA. Mansour bin Zayed and Khaldoon Al Mubarak were essentially alleged by rights groups of attempting to “sportswash” the “deeply tarnished image” of their country by funneling money into the club.

In 2018, a report by German magazine *Der Spiegel*, based on leaked internal emails and documents, alleged that Sheikh Mansour's Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) financed the sponsorship payments himself. In order to escape the FFP rules, direct money from Emirati owners was wired to sponsor companies based in UAE, including Etihad Airways and Aabar Investment, which was then transferred into the club. ADUG's accounts were managed by Mubarak's Abu Dhabi government agency, Executive Affairs Authority (EAA). Besides, the money flows from government into the team were approved by Mubarak. The Emirati owners created a "closed payment loop", where they set up a shell company, Fordham Sports Management, to pay players for their image rights. Usually players are paid by the club for their image rights. But for City, it was Fordham, which received £11 million annually from the Abu Dhabi owners. The channel allowed the club to hide expenditure, and to save €30 million in marketing income. A main person involved in such deals and negotiations between Abu Dhabi and City was Simon Pearce, an Australian who worked in EAA. Before making any multimillion-euro transfers to the club, Pearce was supposed to seek for permission from the chairman, Mubarak, who would approve all the transactions.

Manchester City replied to the reports stating that they were based on "hacked or stolen" emails or documents, but did not say that the leaked emails were not fake. In March 2019, UEFA opened the investigation into the alleged breach of FFP rules by the City owner and the chairman. In February 2020, the club was banned from the Champions League for 2 years, with a fine of €30 million. But, in July 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) lifted the ban and reduced the fine to €10 million, stating that majority of the violations were "either not established or time-barred". In April 2022, leaked emails were re-published by Der Spiegel. The report claimed that Manchester City was being investigated by the Premier League in terms of three allegations– The club pressured underage players to sign with City, disguising owner's funding as sponsorship payments, and secretly paid compensation to Roberto Mancini through Al Jazira.

In February 2023, Manchester City was alleged by the Premier League, which had concluded a four-year long investigation, of contravening more than 100 regulations on various occasions, most of which relating to finances. The league said City had provided misleading information about their finances for a nine-year period under Al Mubarak and Sheikh Mansour, with an independent commission to review the case. The Premier League's charges included 80 alleged breaches concerning the financial rules in 2009–18 and 30 breaches related to City's alleged lack of cooperation with the investigation since December 2018. The club subsequently released a statement, welcoming the appointment of an independent commission.
