The **Financial Supervision Commission** (FSC) (Manx: *Barrantee Oaseirys Argidoil*) was the financial regulator of the Isle of Man.

The commission was established in 1983. The Chairman was previously a Member of Tynwald until legislation forbade this in 2004.

In 2015, the FSC merged with the Insurance and Pensions Authority (IPA) to form the Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA).
