## History

The family business was founded in 1887 by M. N. Mathai (who goes by N. Mathai Muthoot) in Kozhencherry, Kerala. Mathai initially traded in timber and food grains, supplying rations to large British-run plantations.

In 1939, the group established banking and finance services to provide immediate financial assistance to customers in rural and non-rural areas through easy secured loans. Post-independence, the demand for credit increased as individuals discovered their household gold as a safe and convenient means to get credit. Mathai then moved into the gold loan business.

In 1979, the business was split among the founderâ€™s three surviving sons. The eldest son, M. George Muthoot, moved out of Kerala and set up Muthoot Finance. The youngest son, M. Thomas Muthoot, also known as Muthoot Pappachan, then incorporated Muthoot Pappachan Group. The group is currently under his three sons T. John Muthoot, T. George Muthoot and T. Thomas Muthoot (known as just Thomas Muthoot).

In May 2024, the group signed Shah Rukh Khan as a brand ambassador.
