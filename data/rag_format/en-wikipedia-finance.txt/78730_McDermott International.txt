## History


### 1923–2023

In 1923, Ralph Thomas McDermott established J. Ray McDermott & Company Incorporated at the age of 24 upon receipt of a contract to build 50 wooden drilling rigs for a wildcatter in Luling, Texas. Knowing he could benefit from his father's long-time experience in the lumber and oilfield construction businesses, Ralph made John Raymond McDermott a partner and the company's namesake.

In 1930, it expanded the business from its original headquarters in Eastland, Texas, to Luling after a boom in oil exploration in the area. In 1932, the company moved to Houston, Texas with the continuing oil boom. It provided different services to the oil industry through three McDermott family-owned businesses: J. Ray McDermott & Co., Elmax Construction, and Stall & McDermott.

1937 saw the hiring of the company's first construction crew, a team of six. The company opened a New Orleans, Louisiana office. In 1938, the company introduced the first use of floating drilling equipment in low-lying marshlands of Texas and Louisiana. The following year, it purchased J.G. McMullen Dredging Company and established it as the Olsen Dredging Company.

In 1946, the company reorganized the multiple McDermott family business operations into one: J. Ray McDermott & Co., Inc. of Delaware. The following year, the company designed and installed the first fixed platform made of steel out-of-sight-of-land, in 20 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico for Superior Oil. It also established a contracting division, which was the major operating segment during the early years.

In 1948, it acquired assets of Harry F. Allsman Company, McDermott's joint venture partner for several contracting jobs in the Gulf of Mexico, which provided equipment to meet the new demand for offshore construction. In 1949, the company was commissioned the construction of the first vessel designed specifically for offshore work (Derrick Barge 4). The company's Oil Division was also organized.


### Restructuring

In 2010, McDermott International share-holders agreed to spin off the U.S.-based government contracting services company Babcock & Wilcox and its related other domestic companies. The oil & gas services company, J. Ray McDermott, discontinued use of the J. Ray McDermott brand; and continued its oil & gas services contracting under the name McDermott International. The company is led by Chairman, President, and CEO David Dickson.


### 2017–2018

On December 18, 2017, CB&I and McDermott agreed to combine and form a fully vertically integrated onshore-offshore company. The merger was approved in May 2018. In March 2018, the company announced that it had new business with Baker Hughes and BP, with David Dickson still CEO. CB&I's stock ceased being listed on the NYSE on May 11, 2018. Gary P. Luquette was the chairman of the combined company. In May 2018 the company became a member of the S&P MidCap 400, replacing Diebold Nixdorf.

In August 2018, McDermott signed a contract with Shell to work on the Perdido development in the Gulf of Mexico. Also, that month, the company was sued by TechnipFMC over allegedly stolen trade secrets.


### Post combination

After the combination, LNG projects in Hackberry, LA & Freeport, TX and Power projects experienced challenges and the company sold a portion of its pipe fabrication operations.

McDermott secured a $1.7B credit deal. This deal carries super senior credit terms that are structured with the "kind of terms they would receive if they were to convert their debt to a debtor-in-possession loan in bankruptcy."

The company purchased Siluria Technologies, which developed oxidative coupling of methane processes, in 2019.

McDermott released their 2019-Q3 earnings with no earnings call. They posted a $1.9B loss.


### 2020 bankruptcy

On January 21, 2020, McDermott announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, cancelling all shares of common stock.

The bankruptcy case was filed as prepackaged restructuring in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas and includes the parent company, McDermott International, Inc. and 247 affiliated companies. The primary case is identified as case number 20-30336.
