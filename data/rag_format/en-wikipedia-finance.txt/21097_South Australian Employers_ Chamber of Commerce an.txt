## History

Historically, employer organisations in Australia were established to counter the union movement’s growing industrial relations influence. This became more important over time as union tactics became increasingly aggressive, making it harder for individual employers to deal with their employees in good faith.

Business SA can trace its origins back to 1839. Just three years after the Colony of South Australia was established, the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce was formed on 7 January 1839.

This was followed by the South Australian Chamber of Manufacturers in 1869 as a lobby and support group for manufacturers, and the South Australian Employers’ Federation in 1889.

In 1972, the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce and the South Australian Chamber of Manufacturers merged to form the Chamber of Commerce and Industry SA, Inc.

In 1993, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the South Australian Employers’ Federation merged to form the South Australian Employers’ Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc.

The name Business SA was officially launched in 2000.

The South Australian Business Chamber was launched in 2024.
