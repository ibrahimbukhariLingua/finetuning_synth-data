## History

In 1946, Mark Abrams formed a market research company called Research Services Ltd. (RSL). RSL operated until 1991 when it was acquired by Ipsos, becoming Ipsos UK.

MORI (Market and Opinion Research International) was founded in 1969 by Robert Worcester. Robert Worcester stepped down from chairmanship of MORI in June 2005. Ipsos announced it would acquire MORI in October 2005 for Â£88 million, and would merge it with Ipsos UK. The merged company was named Ipsos MORI. In February 2022 the company rebranded to simply *Ipsos*.
